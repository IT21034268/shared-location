3,"Have No life, read Atlas Shrugged","Basically this book sends the message that laisezz-faire and a free-market capitalist society are indeed the best and most moral systems of use, or at least in the eyes of Ayn Rand. Along with this idea through her writing critiques socialist and communist systems. Which makes sense, she having lived through the period. The philosophical aspects of the book are intriguing yet become too repetitious."
2,Atlas Shrugged,"Ayn Rand wrote a good book, and it somewhat kept me interested because of all the certain mysteries it had. There were certain things that I had questioned at the beginning, and wanted to find out by the end. I am not into politics, so that sort of kept me at a distance with the book. All my questions were answered by the end, but I'm irritated by the ending of the book. I didn't think that the ending was very good, there are probably better ways that Rand could've ended the book."
5,capitalism being destroyed,A great read and very fitting about whats going on in our country today. We are being overrun by a socialistic government and this book shows how frustrating it is to own a busness you have built and the government just comes in and destroys you. I am amazed that I have not read this book earlier. Very well written. Suggest you read one or two chapters a day and then analize what you have read. This book will be an enjoyable read for both sides of the aisle. The movie should be a 5 star.
5,A visionary book being played out in our time,"Ayn Rand had an uncanny ability to foresee the road that ""social justice"" would lead us to. I'd say we're an o it 3/4 of the way to the complete economic meltdown she predicted."
4,Must read for every hard-working person,... And for anyone who likes to understand how the worl works. A wonderful inquiry into the logic of capitalism.I think I was very very late in reading this book. Anyone around 20 should already get their hands on it.The missing 5 th star is for the lack of literary brilliance although it is still a good read.
5,A Classic Book for Our Troubled Times!,"Who would have thought that Ayn Rand's timeless work would be coming into reality NOW; not just on the Movie screen, but in the REAL ""growth of our Government""!"
2,I Shrug My Shoulders,"This is political doctrine in the form of a novel. Unsurprisingly, characters are psychologically flat. Everything is way too simple for the author, the people, the values, the economy. If you are a devoted Libertarian and like to indulge in the warm, fuzzy feeling that this young person's philosophy (gun-ho simplistic and optimistic), you will like Atlas Shrugged. Otherwise, you will find it difficult to deal with all the ideology that this book really is. I give this books two shrugs."
4,Thelonius gets it wrong.,"Funny how so many in these reviews complain about the book's philosophy, and yet their own philosophy is skewed by bad facts. Here's Thelonius's take (a couple down): ""It was government regulation that saved the US economy from itself during the Great Depression."" UNTRUE -- if you read your economic history, the government actually helped to prolong the Depression. *** ""It was government protectionism that protected nascent American industries during the early years of America's early nationhood."" --Not true either. Protectionism to stop ""dumping"" is not a bad idea, but protectionism does nothing but reduce trade, hurting those it intends to protect. Again, read your economic histoty. *** ""The America that Rand imagines really never existed, except in theory."" ....Sorry, it's alive and well today."
2,Good story but very small print,This is a small book with small print.Easier to fit in a bag but it is very small print.
4,Atlas Shrugged,"Excellent book. Even though it was written over 50 years ago the subject matter is not dated. Very long book, however if you're looking for a quick read."
1,Horrible,So disappointing. I loved Fountainhead but not this. Wading through the cumbersome speeches gave no more insights to Rands point. I got it the first 100 times
2,Not good,"The writing is not especially good. The underlying philosophy is contrary to Christian values (yet this is oddly very popular with conservative Christians). I honestly had to force myself to finish this. It is a cynical view of life that reflects an extreme ""me first"" view of humanity. How that meshes with the words of Christ (compare with the Sermon on the Mount, for example) or any religious tradition or humanistic view is totally unclear to me. Unfortunately, the children of the greatest generation (the baby boomers) have instilled a sense of extreme self-centeredness in our society. The hippies became Regan era yuppies and then morphed into angry and aging tea party members. The self-centered objectivism philosophy meets the needs of this very spoiled generation perfectly."
1,ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ,"First of all, she rips off Aristotle. Aristotle! the idiot who kept women and men in chains for thousands of years. As if a slave has the opportunity to be selfish! She also misses the point of Adam Smith's invisible hand, that ethics and self motivation go hand in hand. Second, her ""philosophy"" is so mind numbingly shallow, and politically motivated (!) that you have to be the least read person on earth to think it thought provoking. Worst of all, she writes like doo doo. IF you can get through the 1,000 pages, and good luck, you are the all time attention span world champion. Rand probably isn't all that controversial, just insipid and dull. The characters stink! The revelation: The Government is bad! Take care of your own needs! Believe in yourself! Self Determinism (tell that to the slaves, Aristotle). Capitalism ROCKS.LEAD US AYN, WE ARE YOUR HUMBLE SERVANTS. We live in darkness without you.You'd be better off reading Kahlil Gibran..."
4,Good book but too long.,"The book was engaging. The story line was different and interesting. The author Could have made the book about half the size if she didn't explain her theories from so many different angles and perspectives. Seems like she was afraid that the reader would not understand her theories with simple examples or explanations. For example, John Galt's speech really does not need to take an entire chapter for the reader to understand his philosophy. Even after wading through all that, the book was still a good read. Have high hopes for the second part of the movie. The first part was well done and entertaining."
1,Trash,In Rand's world the value of a human life is equal to only to said human's bank balance. I would rather die than live in her world.
1,Sheer Trash,"The writing is primitive, the philosophy no more advanced than that of an ape, and the end result of the ideals espoused in this book would be the ultimate annihilation of everything. If you agree with this book then you have a problem. Part of the stupidity of the book is that if you buy into Ayn Rand's relativistic (ironically, she refers to it as Objectivist) philosophy, it is impossible to believe in anything, including Ayn Rand and her trash that glorifies greed. If you don't serve others, then your efforts are wasted because you, in the end, are nothing. Greed is the definition of futility."
1,We all say stupid things,"We all say stupid things. It is part of the human condition. No one is immune. Most of us try to avoid saying stupid things. Ayn Rand though has managed to string together twelve hundred pages of silliness. It is a singular achievement. Everyone should read this thing at least once. Don't let the 'sales' figures fool you. Ms. Rand's Society of Silly Thinkers distributes thousands of these doorstops each year attempting, one supposes, to identify every possible paranoid-schizophenic who suffers from an advanced persecution complex and reassure them, they are not alone."
1,"Sick, superficial, & absolutist (& that's being nice!)","What an awful book! A thousand plus pages of cardboard characters who are either all-good or all-bad, a simplistic ideology that, I think, reflects her native Russia a hell of a lot better than the US, where it's set. This IS the land of you work hard you get more. Are we that starved for contrarian ideas that we'll embrace anything? If you want a philosophical justification for not caring about your fellow man, & are simple-minded, this book is for you. Me personally, I'll take compassion any old day. I mean, we're supposed to feel sorry for American industrialists? Since when are they persecuted here? (poor Mr Rockefeller! Oh, Mr. Gates, how horribly you're treated in this country!) Give me a freakin break!"
1,She loved a serial killer,"I can't read a book written by someone who admired and respected a known murderer, William Edward Hickman. He was a man without morals, without conscience, perfect for todays CEO's."
5,Reprise,"While I have already written to Amazon regarding this purchase, I hope this second review is accepted and taken to heart by the reader. 'Atlas' is a template for much of what the nation is experiencing today. It predicts and foretells the results of any out-of-control administration, permitted by an ignorant electorate which finds value in a government that seemingly caters to all public needs and wants.I purchased this book for a friend. I was going to send him my tattered, 1084 page edition published in 1957 but it has become an old friend I couldn't let go. 'Atlas' is what some would call a tough read;Rand does take great care to develop the leading and suporting characters.If you like thinly developed plots and personalities this is not your sort of read. However, if you want or need a more comprehensive understanding of where we've been and where we are likely headed, you should read ""Atlas Shrugged"" as a reference text and warning."
5,More like prophecy than a novel,"Ayn Rand has received a lot of bad press over the years from reviewers in denial. What is probably the best defense of capitalism and the once great American way of life is now proving to be more prophecy than novel as the Republic spirals down into police-state socialism. Yes, it's a long novel and yes it's sometimes seemingly redundant in spots but I never tire of reading it all the same. For you younger readers out there that have become functionally literate despite a government school education, just ignore what you've heard about Ms. Rand and read Atlas Shrugged. You won't regret it."
4,Big book: Got this for a youngster to apply for the scholarship,"I bought this book for a youngster in high school. I wanted him to apply for the Rand scholarship. I glanced through the book. The youngster really enjoyed the book, although it took him quite a while to read it. It is a big book."
3,Atla shrugged millinium edition,"mismatched capital letters throughout the book such as mAy and fAkland hotel make it harder to read, and will keep me from buying this version (kindle) of the book."
1,Who can read the small print?,"Bought the book, hoping to learn about the ""must read"" author. Unfortunately, the paperback is printed in a typeface which makes reading virtually impossible. Size matters, even for books!"
5,The Lady was a Prophet,"For an athiest, Ayn Rand was quite the prophet. She nailed human behavior of the future. 'missed the mark on cigarettes though---in her book, the whole world is still smoking in the future."
5,The bible of Western culture,"Rand's conception of humanity is at once cynical and uplifting. In Atlas Shrugged, Rand argues that man should take moral responsibility for his own existence, actions, and future. Few understand that Rand divides the world between people who live morally or immorally - those who live for themselves, and those who live for others, rather than between people inherently good or bad. In Rand's world, greatness is a choice, not a birthright. Rand is not narcissistic, she simply understands what constitutes a fulfilling life philosophy. Hers is not political deconstructionism, but the ultimate expression of self-determination, human dignity, and sustainable morality. At the end of Atlas Shrugged, one can only stand in awe of Rand's greatness as a philosopher, writer, and humanitarian. Rand is capitalism's best answer yet to Marx."
3,AUDIO - BOOK REVIEW,"This review is specific to the Blackstone audiobook read by Scott Brick.The ideas brought-out in the novel are important and highly relevant, ESP. in today's increasingly statist society. I'm not going to get into the book itself other than if one can get past some of the hokey dialogue and simplified plot structure ... its the ideas that count. The book needs to be read as an allegory or parable.Regarding the Blackstone audiobook. I am thrilled to have a version of Atlas Shrugged I can listen to during my long commutes. The packaging however is about as low quality as one can get - Cheap, thin paper sleeves and a flimsy paper box. There are 50 CDs, and one would think packaging could have been a little more substantial.Also - the reader Scott Brick has a strange ""affected"" way of reading the dialogue. He reads the whole book in a ""Charleton Heston as Moses"" manner that can get grating."
5,Amazingly prescient account of the path of America.,"Ayn Rand is amazing. How could this Russian-American foresee the downfall of America so clearly so long ago? She wove a beautiful story around a tragic theme. This is a ""must read"" for anyone willing to fight for the survival of American ideals and the American country."
4,"Philosophy, not Novel","I know Ayn Rand wanted to be a novelist first, and only used her philosophy as a starting point to write a compelling novel. Unfortunately, Atlas Shrugged is not a great novel. It's very difficult to get into, because the characters are personified ideals, and don't seem human at all. In the beginning I didn't care about the characters at all, and didn't really care what happened in the story; it all seemed ridiculous to me. I struggled through the first 300 pages (and it eventually took me a whole week to finish!). I'm of the opinion that novels shouldn't be this challenging.However, as a philosophy text, it's wonderful (regardless of your personal philosophy). If you've read philosophy, especially in its nonfiction, essay form, it's very hard to understand. Put the philosophy in a novel form with a story and it's much easier to understand the argument the author is making. If this were Ayn Rand's intention, it would have gotten 5 stars."
5,"My favorite book (fiction, anyway)","I don't know what I can say beyond that title. Rand is brilliant. The scariest thing about this is how much of it seems to come true in real life. You don't even have to agree with her views 100% (I certainly don't) to benefit. In fact, I think anyone posessing an open mind should *want* to hear things that differ slightly from their own beliefs.And I wonder, could we ever get to the point of actually needing a John Galt? Would I be strong enough to join him? Dare I dream - to be him?"
4,"Slow, but readable","I've been reading this on and off for about six months. Very interesting - I especially like the character Hank Rearden. I agree with Ayn Rand about everything, except the egoist thing."
1,the dumbest book ever written?,"Poorly written, hard to believe, full of wooden characters and bad dialogue - totally terrible! And long-winded terrible at that.Espouses a bizaare theory of economics where just a handful of ""industrialists"" are actually the only important people in the world -as if markets didn't drive economies, as if the supply and demand curves weren't even involved, as if investments and team work and workers didn't have an impact on product development.As a capitalist and someone who loves both good literature and just about anything involving market theory, I was so excited to read this book. Then I read it and I found out two things about Ayn Rand: (1) she can't write, and (2) she also doesn't understand a thing about economics.Read it if you want, but wow, is it bad."
2,Altas Shrugged,"Ayn Rand, in a number of sequences with Dagny Taggart, portrays rape as romantic. Having seen what rape does to a young woman, this single plot device disturbs me so greatly and shuts my mind off to any ideas that Ayn Rand presents, however intiguing they may be."
3,Borrrrrrrrrrrriiiiiiiiiiiiiiinnnnnnnnnnnggggggggggg!,"My review of atlas shrugged is that it is very boring to someone like myself. I did, however, find the moral of the story and its concepts with each character very interesting. Ayn Rands philosophy is very broad but she does a good job in explaining in the story line. Her characters came to life with the words that she used to describe them and so did the scene of each chapter as well. The reason that i think that this book is boring is because it is extremely long. I would suggest it to someone who has alot of time on their on hands."
2,Beating a dead horse.,"This novel drags as a work of fiction, and as a work of philosophy it can be paraphrased and condensed into a pamphlet. Mz. Rand chooses the ""beat you over the head with a lead pipe"" style of imparting her philosophical views. there is speech by Mr. Galt towards the end of the book. if you hadn't caught her drift by this point, Galt's 50 page speech does the job of bludgeoning.bon apetit."
4,great book,It gives a lot to think of. I still didn't finish reading it yet but for the part I did I think it is great
5,Excellent Book,"Others have written far detailed reviews on this book, which I would only be repeating.It is simply the second most important book I have ever read, behind the Bible."
5,Prophetic fiction book,"If you want to understand what has happened to America's cities and industry, read this book."
5,see the world today and understand the book as written,"read the book and change the world and your life. I'm 32, a cynic, and have never been a starry-eyed idealist. The fact remains, however, that there is either a John Galt or a looter in each of us: which one are you? Are you capable of creation, or only of looting someone else's work? If it is broken, can you fix it? Powerful, masterfully written with a clear view of laissez-faire capitalism."
1,Toilet Paper,This is the book stupid people read to convince themselves they're smart. Since I have to write more words I suggest you not purchase this book and instead read the Crying of Lot 49.
1,Never got it!,"I ordered this book and never received it. When I checked the tracking, it said it was delivered. I emailed the sender and never even got a response!"
2,Too Much Objectivism,"I read this before, about 45 years ago, and was surprised to find that the only thing I remembered of it was the female protagonist's name. This novel consists of a good story, but structured so that about every 20 pages, one of the four heroes makes a very long (4-5 pages)speech, has a very long discussion, or thinks for a very long time about objectivism. Or so it seems. The interesting thing about the book is that much of the ""entitlement"" programs or rights of today are predicted, and are considered to be major evils. I had to force myself to finish the book. Go see the movie instead and save yourself some time."
4,"Great story, questionable philosophy","Although I am not a fan of Ayn Rand or objectivism, I had to read this book out of curiosity. I must admit that I really enjoyed it. Though I disagree with Rand's opinion that man is the be-all and end-all and that logic and reason are all that is needed to save the world, I do agree with her capitalistic philosophy and thoughts on individual responsibility. The hostility to religion in John Galt's 3 hour radio address towards the end of the book was a disappointment. Some of the speeches in the book were a bit long and dry, but overall I liked it and would recommend it."
1,Ayn Rand - Atlas Shrugged,The book is very small. Tiny words. If you have trouble with your vision you will definitely need a magnifying glass. I would say to find a bigger book with larger print. I have had the book for about a month now and would like very much to get further in the book but the print is very small. What I have read so far I like but I wish I had bought a bigger book with bigger print.
1,Awful writing for awful people,"Have ever met a complete a$$hole and wondered to yourself ""Does that person even have ANY kind of moral code?"" Well, that's most likely a person intimately familiar with Atlas Shrugged. Taken as prose, it's a terrible book - the story is a thinly veiled (and utterly ludicrous) excuse for Rand to natter on and on, her philosophical musings overtaking the plot for tens of pages at a time, until she remembers with a lurch that it's intended to be a work of fiction. The ""philosophical musings"" are essentially a direct refutation of the philosophy of Jesus Christ. Instead of ""do unto others as you would have them do unto you,"" Rand's essential philosophy is ""whatever you want to do is right"" (this is also called ""egoism"" or ""ethical egoism"").Worth a read (if you have the stomach for it) if you want to find out what our society's moral refuse use as justification for their actions, otherwise I'd stay as far away as possible."
1,Outrageous pricing,"Never should anyone pay a 50% penalty for reading on a digital device. This product is not worth anything more than 1 star, even though the content is an extraordinary work."
1,Horrible,"After reading this book I understand why right wing loons like Rand Paul love it so much. In Ayn Rands fictional narrative there are only hard working industrialists and lazy parasites who attempt to cripple the noble efforts of the working capitalists. It's a libertarians wet dream. A magical place where all of their deluded pet theories actually work. In the universe Rand has created there are no people dying of cancer from having ingested water polluted with industrial waste such as cadmium and mercury. There are no thalidomide babies or stupid, greedy investors or bankers causing market crashes. Oh and greedy energy companies who ignore safety recommendations from consultants and cause enormous oil spills? Nowhere to be found in Rands world. All of the complex problems that must be dealt with in a modern civilization are nonexistant in Ayn Rand make believe. To add insult to injury, Rand is a horrible writer who couldn't even make this fairy tale entertaining."
1,The Worst Book I Have Ever Read,"Now, to be honest I found the first 2/3 of this novel very engaging if not somewhat naive, but then I arrived at the last part, ""A is A"", and everything went downhill fast. I expected an incredile conclusion full of action and adventure, maybe a train-robbing scene with pistol shooting and car jumping or a huge civil war in the valley among all the creators, but all I found were shallow characters spouting off a bunch of dull endless monologues, the majority of which seemed to imply that being a greedy selfish jerk ( sorry, a ""self-actualized person"" ) is the most moral path a person can take. In the end the ""good guys"" willingly let millions of innocent people suffer and starve to death for the sake of their muddled contradictory ""principles"". I found nothing redeeming about this book except that it makes a great paperweight and works well for smashing house spiders. Cheers-"
5,One of the greats,"There's nothing left for me to say that hasn't been said here. This book is a fantastic read, a good story overall, and full of important lessons about being a truly productive member of society. It's a bit slow to get into at first, and a few of the scenes can be redundant when Rand is trying to drive a point home, but overall, the message in this book is as relevant today as it was 50 years ago, and the way it is delivered is very unique and entertaining. Should be required reading for everyone in school."
1,"Can Someone Please Explain the Price? 5 Star Book, 1 Star Price","I went to buy this for my Kindle, but when I saw the price I was floored. You can get this in a used bookstore anywhere in America for $2.00.Disappointing move by the publisher/Amazon/Rand Estate.... For the life of me, I can ot figure out why this ebook is so expensive."
1,I Shrugged,"I don't have an argument with Rand's central idea, but she flogs it mercilessly for 1000 tedious repetitive pages. I can only recommend this book to those who aren't sure whether socialism is superior to capitalism, as it might give you food for thought. As literature for art's sake it is unquestionably lousy."
1,A tough slog through the demented author's mind.,"I cannot believe this tripe is the stuff of teaparty dreams. I have a rule of not criticizing what I have not read but I was tempted with this treatise, all 1200 miserable pages of it. At times the redundant comic book style became all too weary. At first it had the welcome of an adventure but quickly dissolved into a propaganda piece, ad nauseum. The overiding feeling while reading was depression. I actually had to stop for two weeks because it bummed me out with its simplistic disjunct logic. But, not wanting to be a looter I plodded on hoping it would reach a point, a reason it is presented as a defense of capitalism. The philosophical guts finally come at about pages 900-1000 and presents a ""believe our greatness or you are death"" theme. The rest is a misogynist anti democratic, cruel attempt to show that greed is the greatest. Please let my hours of toil with this tome stand for something, I read it so you don't have to."
1,Second time I've tried and given up,"I read for an hour or two every night and am not averse to reading long books. I first tried to read this book a year or two ago and gave up. I again tried this month and gave up after 200 pages. It is 1169 pages, in microscopic print.It is utterly verbose and simply boring. It reaks of an author who is enamored of hearing herself speak. There is no reason why this book could not have been 300-400 pages.ADR"
1,Atlas Shrugged,"I have been reading this book for over five months. In the mean-time, I have read at least ten other, much more interesting and compelling books. The only reason I keep reading is because my roommate says, ""This is the best book he has ever read"". And, I have put so much time into it that I am determined to finish it. I would not recommend it to anyone, except to people who want to say that they have read the most droning novel ever written."
1,Randroid blather,"ATLAS SHRUGGED represents the achievement of total philosophical integration by a rational mind of absolutely unbreached integrity. To the novel's enemies - at least to those who are still (marginally) *human* - I say the following:A is A - and contradictions do not exist. Hold the full context - and check your premises. It's either/or, brother: either the facts of reality - or the whims of a looter. Let your mind and your love of existence decide!"
5,Best Ever,"This book is worth reading. It explains the worth of doing good work and explains why each one of us should seek excellence in our workworld. Five stars for a brilliant work of art. The purpose of a book is to enlighten you or entertain you, and Atlas does both in an extraordinary way. Buy it. Enjoy it."
3,Good but difficult reading.,"I received another copy of this book from a family member. I have only gotten through about 1/3 of the book. It is interesting but difficult to read, small print and very thick paperback book. I don't know if it could ever be put in a large print book as it would be way too big to carry around. Other than that, it is very interesting book. I still like reading Janet Evanovich books better though."
4,"Excellent bit of philosophical thinking, if a tad too long.","Reviews of Atlas Shrugged abound on the Internet, so I shall refrain from adding to the collective examination here. Suffice to say, I enjoyed the book thoroughly but it is simply too long (the 12th longest book in the Cyrillic or Latin alphabets, according to Wikipedia).I wanted to give this 4.5 out of 5, but couldn't quite bring myself to round up."
3,WANTED LARGE PRINT,"LIKE THE BOOK,EVEN THOUGH IT IS MUCH TOO WORDY AND REPETITIOUS. FIRST READ IN THE LATE 50'S AFTER READING ""THE FOUNTAINHEAD"". WANTED A NEW COPY. DISAPPOINTED IT DID NOT COME IN LARGE PRINT."
5,Better than advertised,Seller's site stated 4-5 business days for shipment to take place. I actually received notifications immediately and got my package within 2 business days!!!! Excellent service. Condition as promised!! Thx
5,Atlas Shrugged,"I purchased two of these books as gifts. They arrived before the stated arrival date, in good condition. I am very satisfied with any purchases made through Amazon."
1,Very small print,"I sent 2 copies to my daughter and her friend. They reported that they could not read the ""micro print"" and are going to try to exchange it at a boo stroe in Portland.I'm very sorry that they were dissapointed.Peter"
1,Didn't realize it was abridged...,WHe I bought this id didn't realize it was abridged. Too abridged for me. Misses the real meat of the story.
1,Not my kind of intertainment,"Story line started out okay, but soon degraded into sex scenes and female fantesy. To me this was very distastefull. I was unable to finish this book"
4,Good purchase,Got the book in great time and it was in good condition. I am happy with my purchase. It was a suggested read by a friend.
4,Timeless,"What amazed me about this book is the breadth and depth of the plot. I also found the over-arching philosophy to be timeless --one can see similar battles occurring today (E.G. ""Wal-Mart cares only about bottom line and is a big, bad company!"", ""we should only lower the taxes for the less fortunate!"")You DO have to take some of her soapbox-lectures with a grain of salt since she is rather extreme. However it is a great read and thought-provoking, whether one agrees with her philosophy or not."
4,One of the 25 most important conservative/libertarian books,"This book has been described as a very long essay in the guise of a very long novel. It is one of the most devastating critiques ever written of big government and the liberal media. Rand's moral indignation is contagious; after reading her, most readers are forever immune to the enticements of socialism.It must also be said, however, that the militantly atheistic Rand had an unrealistic view of human nature and little appreciation for cultural values. Most people, however mesmerized by her they may be in their youth, outgrow Rand's philosophy, which Burke might have described as a theoretical construct rather than an application of the accumulated wisdom of mankind."
5,A book that will change your life...in more ways than one,"Who is John Galt? A universal question. Who is this man that threatened to stop the ""motor of the world?""Is capitalism ""evil?"" Is the desire to build a better mousetrap, and prove it, so bad? Is subservience, masquerading under the pseudonym of alturism, so noble?See for yourself, and make your own judgement.For me, as I read ""Atlas Shrugged"", I found myself able to only read a few chapters at a time, having to put the book down, in anger at the situations presented in the book, and recognizing that all of us, whether we dare to admit it or not, believe that recognition should be earned, via our efforts, and not just platitudes to satisfy the masses.If only to stir the emotions of a true individualist, this should be must reading for anyone who is not satisfied with the status quo, but truly seeks a better world."
5,A Story For Our Time,"It is amazing that this book was written so long ago. The clash between government regulations and capitalism that is exaggerated by Ayn Rand is more relevant now than ever. I believe that everyone, regardless of their political affiliation, should listen to this book (or read it) ... as soon as possible. Many things are happening in our country that simply aren't sustainable. Give the book a listen. It should help shape your thoughts re: how to solve some of the more difficult problems of our time."
4,I was Inspired/thrilled until 3/4 of the way thru,"I had to agree with all the positive remarks made about this book until about 3/4 of the way through at which time I couldn't believe how ""unbelieveable"" it all became. I felt the pain and frustration with the characters and hailed Ayn Rand for her courage and insight most of the way through. But then all at once she fell far from the mark in my estimation - totally one sided - out of balance with unreasonable conclusions. I found her lack of touch with the reality of human psychology and intimate relationships almost maddening. And as for that 50 page speech - so boring and further more incomprehensible that anyone would sit still to listen to that endless, repetitive summation of ""true value"" etc. let alone an uneducated general public. I loved the first of this novel and wanted so badly to claim it as one of my all time favorites, but I just can't do it based on the final chapters. A must read though - despite the disappointing conclusion."
5,"Great Classic Book by Rand, Excelent Reading by Hurt.","Book should be a must for anyone who intends to use their mind and to create...anything - and those who dont too! Atlas Shrugged is honest, accurate, truthful and profetic - Are you confused by what is happening to you? your company - your country - the world? Are you a Moocher or Looter. If you are not one of these - you'd better find out who they are, how they talk and why they do what they do. The book on tape is great way to get through this huge accomplishment for the first time. An exelent and entertanining reading by Mr. Hurt. After the tape? - read the book!"
2,Terrible and hijacked for political use,"Believe it or not, Ayn Rand books are rated the top books on all book lists, because all the conservatives vote over and over for it. So don't take any ratings here as serious."
1,Rip off,"The beauty of the Internet, electronic books and all of the efficiency's gained by not printing should be reflected in price, but alas the greedy Penguin publishers think that they will charge more and make up for the poor sales they have recently. The poor sales which are not reflective of their product being stolen, hijacked or share online like the recording industry can truthfully state, but rather they are reflective to the poor quality of the product they have put out. Junk, illiterate nonsense and generally disregarded trash and rather than develop new authors they try and make more money from an old classic. And I would fashion a guess that this behavior is their way of snubbing their nose at amazon.com who is one retailer who has saved them not hurt them. So who wins here. Amazon does not get the sale. Penguin does not get the sale and "" who is John Gault"" never gets discovered.Good job Penguin. You certainly have scored a victory."
1,100 pages of dribble cruelly stretched into 1000 pages.,"While Ayn does bring up some good points about indiviual responsibility for ones future, her overall theme of total subjugation to industrialism would spell the end to all that is native, primitive and lovely about the earth we live on. The story is shallow and predictable and along with her insular philosophy, could easily have been contained in a tenth of the volume it occupies."
1,Objectivism in novel form,"It seems to me that one has to separate Objectivism from the Cult it generated. Rand DID write some very helpful things, but also some nonsense. There is a lot of evidence around that she was not a very pleasant person to be around unless you treated her like a omniscient prophet. The problem is that her legacy has been transformed into a dogma by some people who refuse to see her dark sides. I strongly urge you to read Jeff Walker's The Ayn Rand Cult. It's not a great book, but I believe his research is sound. He has read most of the literature about Rand, as well as interviewing Objectivists and ex-Objectivist that knew Rand. Then ask yourself this question: Which one is most truthful, Jeff Walker's book or the hagiography Ayn Rand: A Sense of Life? I guess reason requires you to read both before you make up your mind."
2,Shockingly... disturbing.,"A striking irony concerning Ayn Rand's work is that it generally appeals more to the mindless and ignorant, rather than the free-thinkers she claims to champion. I suppose one reason for this is that her philosophy leaves no room for dissent or original thought - you either take it all or nothing. Even Rand herself has trouble overcoming her lack of ideas as she struggles (rather unsuccessfully) to fill out an original monologue for each of her heroes through the course of the books 1000 pages.As for those willing to read Rand objectively, the most I can say for her is that she makes sense -- sometimes. Rand starts off simple enough (""A"" is ""A""), but soon thereafter cooks up such a furious mess of twisted logic that you'll either write it off immediately or become hooked. Don't worry though- like any fine narcotic, Rand's effect will wear off once you realize you've become miserable and peerless. Just don't overdose."
1,1 Rand = 1 nano-Hugo,"Was there ever a more vile and monstrous piece of literary excrement foisted upon the world? I don't know of one. Rand claimed to look up to Hugo, well she must have used a very big telescope to even catch a glimpse of him."
5,Life-changing,"Just as Amazon.com created the kindle, this book is an inspiration for any person who chooses to better the world through their own selfishness which in turn, helps the rest of us. What on earth is wrong with going into business solely to make a profit? All the naysayers who speak of the common good are plenty to apt to grow very upset and enraged when their rewards for the efforts they put forth each day are dwindled down or even cut off. Yes, the attitude Ayn Rand's John Galt, Henry Rearden and Dagny Taggart express is the most practical in our world today or any world before or after it. Truly the best book I've read in quite a while and I will definitely read it again."
2,A tremendous waste of paper,"The book is interesting as a political statement, but it reads like a real estate contract. That it is over 1000 pages long made it pure torture to read. I started this book hoping to learn something, but the only thing I got from it is the pride one feels when finishing an arduous task that few others could complete. If Ayn Rand were still alive I would send her some punctuaion marks. The sentences are so interminably long that I thought she was trying to conserve periods. Interrogators will sometimes play acid rock music over and over to browbeat their subjects into submission, this book is a written version of that."
3,"Please, Ayn! Repeat yourself! Beat us up!","Rand's work suffers because she was so full of herself that she refused to let the publisher change a word. Bennet Cerf at Random House knew she was serious, and that they'd lose a ton of money if she took it to somebody else. This is a book badly in need of editing... after while nothing she or anyone says is a surprise. Her attitude that corporations should be free to do whatever they want as long as they make money is horrifying: witness Enron, Microsoft, Big Tobacco, the oil companies.It took her four years to write John Galt's radio address. What a pity. Immediately seeing it for what it was, I just skipped it. She'd said it all before."
5,An awesome yet terrible read,"I love this book. Really. It is indeed as important in advancing many concepts as its proponents state.But... I have to say the characters themselves are horribly developed and completely unbelievable. The dialog at times is just painful. And the situations often are poorly contrived.YES... I GET IT. I get why Ayn built them the way she did, why she had them say what they said. And I am grateful. The story of the auto manufacturer alone has really helped to distill the fundamentals of many concepts for me.So as an approachable and important philosophical work, A+.As a fiction novel... maybe C+."
5,A must read - Pro America anti social agenda,"In today's political climate this is a must read, or listen to. It should be mandatory reading, listening, for all Americans. It is a real eye opener. It really makes one think about all the entitlements being handed out. All the news out lets should be promoting this book. They however will not because it would break the current leftist social agenda being promoted by the main stream media."
3,Too verbose,"Subject matter very timely but, Ayn Rand is way too verbose and repetitive.I found the book boring in many places and found her style lacking.She repeatedly used the word wish instead of want or like. Her description of the characters was very sophomoric. I reminded me of a high school student's writing."
3,Atlas Shrugged Off Objectivism,"This novel receives a lot of acclaim mostly because of Ayn Rand's philosophical pretensions, and people tend to overlook the story itself. The book starts out with great mystery and human drama of an epic scale and seems to be headed for a 5 star rating, but... halfway through turns into a bizarre sci-fi yarn that is dated, to say the least. I was left pondering many philosophical issues, including the value of a good editor who can trim off long winded self indulgent passages for a more streamlined novel.Having said all that, the book is still quite an achievement and a page-turner for the most part. It's well grounded in the mid-20th century, and is a fine relic of that era."
3,I can't beleive I read the whole thing,"I got to hand to the author on how she was able to come up with new words to say the same thing over and over and over and over and over, again. Two thirds of the words could be easily eliminated without missing a beat. I've seen this book described as a mystery but I see none. It was pretty simple to figure out what was gonna happen and who was who."
5,A prophetic and immensely important must-read!!,"I will be brief; I will not go over ground already covered by so many others. Atlas Shrugged is one of the very most important books anyone in the current age could read. It's only a shame Ayn didn't live long enough to see the ultraliberal excesses and wrong-headedness of the Obama administration, because then she would truly have known how astonishingly prophetic her writings were. In an age that finds itself in delusional paroxysms of retreat from the whole notion of personal responsibility, we need Ayn Rand's clarity of vision. My only regret is that I didn't read this myself many years ago. But better late than never; this is a work that can change your life. READ Atlas Shrugged!! And re-read it."
3,"Terrible Writing Style, Amazing story.","Ayn Rand's writing style is overtly feminine and long winded, which I hate. But the strong character and moral progressions makes the book a fascinating classic. A must read for a well learned individual."
4,A great read!,"As typical of today as the times in which it was written. A bit wordy in some places, slow in some parts, but fast moving in others."
4,Interesting philosophy carried too far w/o quality editing,"Ayn Rand's ""Atlas Shrugged"" outlined (that term is used loosely! -- in about 500 pages too many) her philosophy, Objectivism, which promotes Capitalism in an interesting and occasionally original and diverting manner. Were it not so long and so often lecturing, I would recommend it as a must-read. Her fictional account of John Galt, an epitomized version of the perfect genius/capitalist, and her endearing, realistic, powerful and intelligent heroine (four adjectives in a rare combination in American fiction) would make this book captivating and a true must-read if she were not so intent on converting all of her readers to Objectivism. If you are capable of guiltlessly skipping 30 page + sections of lecture to get to the rest of the plot, I highly recommend reading this book"
4,More than just a long book,"Like ""War and Peace"", or ""Rise and Fall of the Roman Empire""; this is one of those really long books that all ""big-time readers"" should tackle at least once in their lifetimes.While there are some overly long-winded and boring parts - most notably Galt's speech near the end of the book - the book manages to keep ones interest, and there are some decently exciting moments... and I got a laugh out of Francisco's hurried response to the Guard's question; ""What's your business?"" - ""Copper Mining!"".If you are really left-leaning, you will probably find this book insulting, as the government and anti-business types are made to look like dopes, weasels, and/or out-right thieves.In any event, the basic premise of the book (of looters, moochers, and beggars taking advantage of the producers) has merit, and there were many instances when I was made to think about real-life analogies.You know, I'm willing to bet that Ronald Reagan read and enjoyed this book."
5,In defense of human liberty,"Despite the ramblings of those who are hostile to Ayn Rand, and her passionate defense of human liberty, the fundamental issues she addresses are not that difficult to understand.Do you believe that your life should be the property of others, to be disposed of as they see fit, or not? Ayn Rand took the stand that your life belongs to you, to be lived as you see fit.Critics of Ayn Rand must agree, at least to some extent, with folks like Adolph Hitler (and his beneficent National Socialist party) that the individual should be considered the property of others (in this case, the state). These people really should think more carefully about the company they keep, at least on an intellectual level. But, then, what's a ""little"" slavery?"
5,A book that will change your life,"I recieved this book from my mentor as a high school graduation present. Since then, I have read it about 5 times (my graduation was about 2 years ago) and each time, I pick up small details that I have not noticed before. Rand's use of metaphors is absolutely brilliant. A perfect unity of physics and philosophy (okay, philosophy more so than physics), it explains the relationship between work and money as being in ideal balance when following the three laws of thermodynamics. A must-read for the modern intellectual."
5,Great!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,Great book for today. Glad I heard someone speaking about the book. It's just amazing it was written 50 yrs ago. Glad I decided to buy and read it.Everyone should read this book.
4,More than worth plowing thru somewhat intimidating length.,"Forget the intense philosophical speeches. Hang in there through the first few chapters. You will discover riveting ideas about how our society works, and intriguing characters building the mystery, ""Who Is John Galt?""You may not agree with everything Rand has to say (you can safely skip over the long philosophical speeches and still have one heck of a read), but you cannot deny that many of her concepts ring true. As a high school student, this novel opened my mind and my eyes, and it is still fresh today. Entertaining and a classic."
2,Book review,Print too small for my old eyes and book is well worn. Next time I will know to specify print size and book condition.
1,Same book but different cover with tiny font,Unable read due to extremely small font--did not receive the pictured book with the fontviewed online. Should picture the version of the book being sent to the customer.
3,Wrinkled Atlas,"I first read the book 35 years ago. It was iconic then and proved to be prophetic for what is happening today in South Africa. However, most of the colouring in of scenes are dated and distracting i.e. people making 'long distance phone calls'; people being fashionable by smoking; women wearing hats and stockings;"
5,Frightening Foreshadowing...,"Does the recent Microsoft ruling seem familiar? It is exactly what Ayn Rand predicted would happen. Even 60 years ago, she could identify the American hatred of wealth and success, the hatred of anyone working or living for his own interests. So Microsoft creates a product that consumers want. For that, it is punished. What the Justice Department is essentially saying to the country is, ""You can create a product and sell it, but don't dare be too successful at it."" So much for free market capitalism. My only hope is that Bill Gates has read Atlas Shrugged and will close up shop, depriving the world of all Microsoft products. How dare the U.S. government attempt to dictate to him how he must sell his products. Is this the United States or communist USSR?"
1,Ridiculous Price for Ridiculous Philosophy,"What I've said in my title pretty much says it all. First, the price......why should an ebook be more expensive than a paperback? Does Penguin want to punish us who have ereaders? Don't understand why they want to turn off any readers. I certainly won't buy it and I'll think twice about buying any other Penguin books.As for Rand's philosophy....for those who are ""ME, ME, ME!!!"" people it will just confirm their self-centered, selfishness. For the innocent who can't think beyond the words, it probably will be accepted without being questioned....though questions are what are most needed when assessing a philosophy.Me, I read it when it was first published and the years since have only confirmed that it is a philosophy for those who care only for themselves and who are devoid of any sense of reality. (In fact, it might have been this kind of philosophy that caused Penguin to charge such a ridiculous price.)"
1,Grow up,Consulting Ayn Rand on economics is like consulting Edgar Rice Burroughs on astronomy. At a certain point one must grow up.
3,Attempted to slog through,"around halfway, could no longer deal with the dull characters - there weren't any freedom-fighters, bikers, gangsters; just boring-a$$ rich people. (By the way, Ken Follet[sp?] writes 1,000+ page books, but his, you can't put down, his characters are interesting - hhmm, are MEN simply better writers than wimmin???).Back to Ayn, from reading your reviews, maybe it's time to give Atlas another try - even though her economic-darwinism sucks little ones. But more importantly, atheism is contained within time/space; in other words, allowing one's brain to be stuck inside the box."
4,just a great page turner,"In first deciding to read this book ,I was very aware that it had philisophical and political implications(and or applications).however like so many great novels I found my self imersed in the plot and the story.""Are they going to find the Motor?""""will the Railroad Stay in business""""Why Cant Reardon Sell as much of his alloy to anyone he pleases""and of course ""WHO IS JOHN GALT?""all politics asidea well written story line that keeps you wonderingand interested for the most part.when finished you are left with many questions about how things are done in our societyand often how insane govenments can be .it's one of the BIG BOOKs of all time for good reason!!!"
1,Truly a Novel of Ideas ...,"I counted two of them. Even a John Grisham novel has at least four ideas.I greatly enjoyed Ayn whacking me on the head with the same two notions every page for over a thousand pages. Whack! Whack! Do you got it yet? You sure? Whack! I want to make sure you got it. Whack!Thanks, Ayn.Prerequisites for reading this book are either a helmet or a naturally thick skull.If you have any respect for the art of writing or any background in philosophy, don't waste your time. If you've read the reviews here, you've read the book."
1,"Clever propaganda, terribly dated and shallow","What a waste of time this book was. 1100 pages to convey a message that is ""do what's best for yourself, and to hell with everyone else."" Rand's foolish excuse for philosophy is exceeded only by the clumsiness of her prose, which features such winning phrases as ""When asked what he would want to do he answered at once, 'Whatever is right.'""This book is a product of 50s McCarthyism and anti-Communist fervor, and uses a remarkably dull method of repeatedly constructing straw men to have them torn down by Rand's superman.This is indulgent candy for the mind, and utterly lacking in both literary and intellectual merit."
5,Pretty Good,"Considering that this is the best book, next to the bible, in terms of influence according to the library of congress...I wanted a book that was marked up and ragged, but this one was in great condition.I've read a lot of books. This one takes about 115 pages to get interesting, but the following roughly 900 are pretty good."
4,"The cure for ""liberal""","This story is a fairly good read just as an adventure, but it's greatness comes from the absolute dissection of socialism (what the socialists of our generation call ""liberal"" or ""progressive""). Socialism is a disease and Ms. Rand explains that to you in such excruciating detail that you have no shred of cover to hide behind and continue fooling yourself that 'liberal' is something respectable.Unfortunately it's more preaching to the choir; those who already want to fight liberals are the only ones who will actually read it. This country is doomed, the 2008 election was lost months ago, there is nothing BUT socialism on the ballot."
2,A dissapointment,"Atlas Shrugged seems to be an apology by Ayn Rand for writing a devastating account of an individualist in ""The Fountain Head"". Atlas gives too many explanations for questions that were left unanswered in Fountain Head and for which it was perhaps most respected. I think this book is best read while you are in college and are scratching the surface of reality"
1,Ayn Rand turns rich white people into the most slapable people on earth,"Ayn Rand must have set out to make rich white people more smug jackasses than they already were. Aside from the fact that the book is just terrible and not really that well written, it has become the bible of those that feel they are so much more special than the rest of the world. That they are the important ones, and everyone else can go and die. Do yourself a favor, don't read this, and go and help another person in need. You will feel better about yourself and won't be a d-bag."
2,Too many pages,"This book is a parable. It would be pretty good if it were fifteen pages long, but instead it's about 1,200 pages long. The characters are two-dimensional, the plot is incredible, the whole thing is...ridiculous. Fine for a parable. But this thing is 1,200 pages long. Save your strength. Read Hayek instead."
1,Absolute Excrement,"This book is not only morally reprehensible, worse, it is bad fiction. Rand was a maniac and has almost no understanding of philosophy. In fact, she gets it almost uniformly backwards. If you are ignorant of the history of philosophy, maybe you might enjoy this...but if you have any aesthetic sense, I don't see how you can."
5,A Great book...,"ATLAS SHRUGGED is an incredible book, and it seems that it accurately predicted the future. At times, it is a bit hard to follow, and it is a HUGE book - but reading the book, and seeing the two movies (so far) have made understanding much more complete. Read it and learn!"
4,Quite a Book!,"This is indeed quite a book. People love it or hate it. It makes some people crazy. For a young, fresh mind it is engaging and hypnotizing. Many older readers are less inclined to enjoy it. But hey, let's accept it for what it is worth."
5,Fascinating--a life changing book,"This is my favorite book--has been ever since I first read it. The characters are captivating--the story grabs you and doesn't let you go. And it has, as the person who first reccommended it to me put it, ""this bitchin' philosophy!""Whatever you've heard about Ayn Rand--that she was controversial, that she inspires fanatasicm, that she was a genius, even that her ideas inspire hatred from college professors (and others who don't know any better)--read this book. See for yourself. This book isn't just ""good"" or just ""inspiring."" Describing it as a classic isn't even enough. This story is an epic, an American legend.Read it--you'll like it, if you aren't a loser. ;)"
5,Important Read,This book engaged me from the beginning to the end. Ann Rynd gave a voice to many thoughts i already believed. it is quite simply the best book i have ever read. $
4,A Journey Of Growth,"The world of ""Atlas"" is a fictional America where the country's industrialists and geniuses are suddenly forced to serve the government without making a profit. When they choose to run rather than serve, this slowly undoes the country, city by city, town by town, person by person, until there is nothing left of America but chaos, starvation, and murder. It sent chills up my spine because this kind of thing CAN happen. I enjoyed the rich imagery she used--it was like reading a very, very good movie script.If you ever detested welfare mommies and people who think they deserve your money JUST because you have more of it, then you'll find a sympathetic voice in Ayn Rand's ""Atlas."" I took off one star only because the book is very extreme and often unrealistic in it's views. Otherwise, it is excellent."
1,I am glad I read this book,"I am glad I read this book, because it helped me understand that Objectivism has many weaknesses.It's now just another theory that I can just cross off the list."
3,DIME STORE NOVEL AT TIMES,"Heros, villians, the true capitalist Rand despite her repetition is an intelligent writer who makes you think! The book is just too long. To many subplots and characters that don't ring true with the exception of Dagney Taggart."
3,Atlas Shrugged,i have not read very much of this. Will save it for later. I wanted to have more availabe reading time before I really got into it.
1,Had to return,"The book came without the first 16 pages. I had to return it, it wasn't that big of a hassle but would rather not have to go about it because the book isn't complete"
1,A boring and (nearly) pointless novel,"The entire book is a mind-numbing prologue to John Galt's speech at/near the end. The speech itself is somewhat interesting, but it's not worth my money."
1,Do not buy this item,"The cover was not the same as advertised, very generic looking not the size shownThe type was SO SMALL you need a microscope to read it.I hope I can return these books"
1,Publisher rip-off,There is no way that I paying $19 for a Kindle book that was originally published in the 50's. What an outrage by the publisher. Ms. Rand's estate should really negotiate with a new publisher.
5,An alternate is available for liberals...,"Atlas Shrugged is one of the most important books ever written. It should be read by all open-minded people. But because it is a tough read, liberals may not be able to get through it. For them, I recommend ""Colony 14,"" which has been called ""the poor man's Atlas Shrugged."" (Yes, that's a shameful, but accurate, plug for my own book!)"
1,"Boring, and out of touch.","This book is now proudly working as a doorstop at my house. I put it face down so as not to embarrass myself in front of company.SUCH a boring read. I barely made it through. I had to at least give it a chance though. What a cheerleading effort for Friedman and his failed policies too! Frrrrrrrrrrrrrnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnt.Do yourself a favor, read The Shock Doctrine by Naomi Klein if you want to read a worthwhile book. Atlas Shrugged isn't worth the paper it's printed on.The Shock Doctrine: The Rise of Disaster Capitalism"
3,Its been around awhile,Ayn Rand books and philosophy have been around for 50 years or more. What can I say that has not been said. It had more meaning to me in my 20's than it does in my 60's. I'm just filling space to meet Amazon's word requirement.
1,Where's the debate...,"Read some philosophy and political science. Try a real ""novel of ideas"" or two. Lean to think critically. Don't waste time reading or debating this turgid non-novel illustrating a non-philosophy.It's odd there's such enthusiasm and rancor in the reviews below. This work and its associated ""philosophy"" falls of its own weight. Its main appeal is to teenagers, either just before they enter college or in their freshman year. And that's great, because it can lead to some of them taking a real interest in philosophy and literature.Rand's philosophy has not had any meaningful effect on society, philosophy, or literature. Ranting about it is a waste of time. I wish those who enjoyed this book, for whom it ""changed their lives,"" the best of luck as they (as many of them will) use it as an impetus to discover a love of philosophy and literature."
5,Atlas Shrugged,"Written in 1957,Rand's book is amazingly insightful to the current political trends of today. She has everything to keep you on the edge of your seat, action, romance and a wonderful cast of characters. She weaves an intricate saga of human nature and how it leads to the thinking that by helping the idle and taxing the inventors, companies and the doers, everyone will be equal. Rand shows that Social Justice will never work and why. A wonderful, insightful read. Hands down the best book I have ever read."
2,Sophmoric,"zSophmoric is the perfect word to describe Atlas Shrugged. It is full of youthful angst and energy, the same self-centeredness of adolescence and the profound ignorance of those who haven't travelled beyond their own safety zones, much less began university-level studies of politics, psychology and economics. Every high school student should read it - sophmore year! - so that he or she can more deeply appreciate the benefits of knowing something of the real world conveyed by higher education and how ideologues like Rand use ignorance to warp perceptions and sooth the guilt and greed of the Taggarts and Galts of the world while fluffing their own nests. Really, would anyone want to spend afternoon or an evening with any of the righteous, narcissistic and downright boring characters of this book while they talked non-stop for hours about things they know little about? If you have, or remember being, a teenager, you know what I'm talking about."
1,Price way too high,"I will not pay this price for this book. It is simply too high. I give it one star although I would like to give it NO stars.Come on, get it down to $9.99 or I will buy the DTB at a garage sale this summer.You are stupid to set the price this high.StevenOregon"
3,Great ideas - problematic plot,"Ayn Rand is very passionate about her ideas, and this book outlines them in great detail.To bad most of the characters are one-dimensional super-heroes or mega-villains that cause the plot to be a little thin.That is a problem in a 1000+ pages novel. I found Fountainhead to be a better book.That said, no one can read Ayn Rand and remain unaffected."
2,A deplorable romance novel and an empty philosophy,"I read this book for the first time at age 14, it thrilled me. Just finished listening to the Highbridge edition on cassette.I think 14 was about the right age to read the book. My capsule review now is as follows:An empty shell of a half-baked philosophy, borne along by a river of the worst sort of romance-novel prose and story structure.The story was well-read by the narrator and entertaining enough on a long car trip. There are certainly better-fleshed-out versions of the philosophy espoused here, and the love story aspect is mushy and starry-eyed enough to make any post-teenager cringe. Ick.Catherine Potter"
2,Too long,"It's just too long to drive home its point. The characters are one-dimensional, or not realistic. Granted it is a philosophical novel, it still is a novel, and the characters should have been made more believable. Too much repetition as well. I also don't understand what the big deal about objectivism is- haven't a lot of people before Ayn Rand been living their lives according to their own self-interest?"
1,THIS BOOK CHANGED MY LIFE!!!!!!!!,"Before I read it, I thought there might be something to Rand!!!! Now that I've read it, I see that she was just a pathetic demagogue whose ""philosophical"" system consisted almost entirely of rationalizations!!!!Read this book and SET YOURSELF FREE -- of the mind-numbing Cult of Objectivism!!!!"
3,Once is Enough,"I become immediately suspicious of a book that has printed on its jacket, ""You will want to read Atlas Shrugged over and over."" Thank you, but I am capable of making up my own mind.That said, Atlas Shrugged should be read once, but if you have never read any Rand I suggest you start with ""We The Living"". Even though Rand is an excellent dramatist and Atlas Shrugged contains some memorable passages, it is a flawed work. It is very dated and extremely didactic. And no, unless you are an Objectivist you won't want to read it over and over."
1,I have lost all faith in Western Civilization,"Who is John Galt? Why do I care? Perhaps the postmodern confusion of my life combined with existential freedom will force me to make ethical decisions based on literary aesthetic rather than reasoned judgement. In such case I'd much rather live my life by ""The Little Prince"" than this piece of shallow trash."
1,Atlas Shrugged,"The print was so small that I could not comfortably read it. Other people inmy book club got the same addition as I did, and felt the same way. It's the first book from Amazon that I have not been pleased with."
5,Loved it,I'm not political. Ayn rand puts in to words what I've not just always felt but what I believed in.
1,Junk Philosophy,"It's funny how the people who love Ayn Rand are almost never serious students of philosophy. There's something going on more than coincidence: it's the fact that Ayn Rand's work is the same kind of junk philosophy that is found in Zen & The Art of Motorcycle Maintenance and the Celestine Prophecy--all are muddle-headed attempts that really only should appeal to young men and women between the ages of 17-19. Those would would subscribe to Rand's ""philosophy"" really just haven't tasted the real thing. Hopefully, they will."
1,atlas shrugged which i have yet to receive,"I wrote to you over a week ago about the wrong book I received and have yet to hear back from you or Kzooshop. I received ""Nine Stories"" by JD Salinger instead of Atlas Shrugged. Everyone keeps passing the buck when I try to get this resolved. Who is ""in charge"" over there?"
5,atlas rocks!,"Fantastic book...all the more so because it so relevant to what is going on today in the US. The current administration is totally liberal and socialist...just like the villians in the book. I find it laughable that Hollywood would not release the movie that just came out...it had to be released independently...gee, must have hit too close to home for the lear jet liberals in CA. Talk about censorship. SO...again...great book...especially if you want beautifully written thoughts to try to put your own in context based on what you see happening right now."
4,libertarian,"I would not give Ayn Rand 5 stars. She's pretty close there, but she missed the whole meaning of trascending. For her own good she could have done better if given the chance to become a Mother. She portrays a very analitically ""the survival of the fittest"". I'm only giving her 4 stars to her book. It's a book that you must have in your library and of course a book to read at least once in your life. My favorite is the FOUNTAINHEAD[[ASIN:0452286751 The Fountainhead (Centennial Edition Hardcover)"
2,"interesting ideas, poorly executed","I think a better writer could have done so much more with the ideas behind this book. The story probably should have been told in half the pages. The protagonists are somewhat believable and likable characters. I wanted to hate the antagonists, but they were so unrealistic in their depiction as extreme ideologues. I was disappointed with the end result. I'll probably read The Fountainhead eventually, but I'm in no rush."
4,Atlas Shrugged,"Product was received in a timely manner, at a value price and in very good condition."
1,Outrageous price,Let me start by saying this review is regarding the Kindle pricing - the book itself is fantastic and a 5 star for sure.I recently bought a Kindle in large part due to the advertisement that hundreds of thousands of books can be had for $9.99 or less; clearly I should have researched a little further before taking the plunge because $18.99 for a digital version of a 50+ year old book is insane. At the moment Amazon seems to carry 3 physical versions of the book - the most expensive costing $14.18 (and anybody who had read this book knows that is a lot of paper and ink).I was looking forward to re-reading some of my favorites on the Kindle but I guess that won't include this book.
2,interesting novel of ideas that ultimately fails for this reader,"This novel is hard to rate. If the rating was based purely on influence, it would be 5. If it was based on boldness, a 4. But the risk of trying to mix philosophy with fiction is that you do both poorly, and there is why I end up at a 2.Purely judged as a novel, it is mediocre for this reader. At time too slow, at others, too obvious. Half-way thru, I found I could predict what characters would say and the outcome of plot complications. John Galt's radio speech in the last third sheds the demands of fiction and becomes pure Rand polemic. On the flip-side, while Rand has a unique philosophy which is very worthy of considering, the novel does not present it in a way that is nuanced or multi-dimensional.The dilemma of this book is that its reputation & influence demand that it be read, but the experience for this reader was disappointing."
3,A hard to put down pulp,"Atlas shrugged has the same issues the Moby Dick does. Under a thousand page novel, a wonderful 200-300 page novel is struggling to get out. The book is a page turner, hard to put down, but is weighed down by the illogical worship of money and power. The assumption that the best minds will always float to the top and that those who are rich are more virtuous destroys a wonderful pulpy thriller. If she had stuck with fiction and ignored philosophy, this would be a 5-star review.I read this book in one night, skipping the speech at the end going to the next part. That speech, in its own right is a horrible piece of drek that should have been edited out by any right-thinking publisher.Pros: Gripping, hard to put down, somehow motivates you to find out what happens nextCons: 2-dimensional (or less) characters, simplistic plot, unnecessary length, stupid pseudo-philosophy.Conclusion: Not bad for a flight across the US if you can stand the embarrassment of carrying it."
1,Invent villains and then call them villains!,"Brilliant!Invent an entire dysfunctional subculture, then point fingers at them and call them dysfunctional.What clownish nonsense.The fact that this book has sold well over the years is a testament to the failings of american education."
1,"Like a skipping CD, this book repeats itself","This book was awful. I picked it up because my brother suggested it, and he usually reads some interesting books. After the first 250 pages, I wasn't exactly excited about what I had read, but I figured, given the size of the book, that I was only through the introduction. I read the next 250 pages and still the book sucked, but along the same rationale I finished it, my brother had to have seen something. The main problem is that the book continously repeats itself, conversations are the same, plot twists are the same, and it is all flawed capitalist extremism. At the end, the protagonists take off their everday clothes to reveal the tight spandex, capes, and a letter C in the middle chest to save the day. (By the way I didn't ruin the ending.)"
1,Half way through and so far I shrugg,I have only read about 50% of the book. So far I am not impressed. Her vision of the business world seems far fetched. Her writing is not great. Her characters are given to long soliloquies (I am talking 20 or 30 pages)that are intended to present a deep thought but fail to deliver. Hopefully the second half of the book will somehow bring it all together.
1,Format of the physical book is ridiculous,"I haven't read the book yet, but the physical format of the book is ridiculous! The pages are TINY, the print is TINY, and the thickness is HUGE. The goofy thing is almost thicker than it is wide. And as for the print, I don't know if I'm going to be able to read it. I didn't know what ""School and Library Binding Edition,"" meant, but apparently it means ridiculously small."
1,1 star for the ideal 4 star for the book,"Ayn Rand believed in some thing , so do most of us .The only difference is she took it to extreme hights .We must remenberThat any kind of extremism breeds intollerence and intollerencein turn breeds all type of social problems.Ayn Rand was pro capitalism , So are most of us ,but she took it too far.So far thatas per her philosophy selfishness is ok.If we have to question her philosophy then the first question that comes to mind is what about humanity?The book is well written but ....?"
1,"very schematic, naive, doctrinaire and...boring book","I started to read it, and dropped it after a few hundred pages, like many other readers. This is just a cold war period novel describing the world in black and white tones, without an ounce of humor or poetry, very reminiscent of socialist realism ! If it is the summit of 20th century american literature, I am very curious to know what will be the next american literature masterpiece !"
1,What William Buckley thought,"Talking to Rose, about the patron-saint of the conservative movement , Bill buckley chats about ayn and her magnum opus atlas shrugged. On atlas shrugged, WFB:""I had to flog myself to read it."" On ayn, WFB : ""Her scorn for charity,for altruism was such as to build up an unfeeling system""[...]"
2,A decent read,"I enjoyed the book for it's historical and philosophical value. I'm just not sure how any person with any knowledge of history could buy the garbage Rand is peddling. While there are some philanthropic 'creative geniuses' they are by and large, ruthless individuals that would step on their own mother to make an extra dollar."
5,Can't wait for the continuation.,It's too bad everyone has not read it. It should be in all young persons hands or in their library. Maybe the economy would be in better shape.Thank Amazon.
5,Amazing book!,Who is John Galt? This is an amazing and thought provoking book. It puts into words many of my own ideals and thought processes.
2,"Predictable, slow, and extremely one-sided.","The ideas presented in the book are interesting, but overall the story is severely lacking. The characters are ridiculously one-dimensional: they are either perfect in every way, or they are sniveling cowards. Plot is a low priority in this book, and what little is there is very predictible. Rand needed to calm down before writing this book; she constantly interjects her opinions into the story via the LONG speeches of some of the ""good guys"", the most notable time being the 60 page sermon near the end of the book.This is the first book I voluntarily quit reading before the end. If you like reading philisophical discourses and agree with the principles of objectivism, you may find the book thought provoking and enjoyable. Otherwise, you'll feel browbeaten and very, very bored."
2,tired social darwinism,"This stuff is not total BS, but I would be hard pressed to give any novel so aestetically displeasing as this anything more than a 7, even with some great passages. The characters are one dimensional, the philosophy is half baked, and the plot is does not exist. A slow plot would be OK, if the characters were capable of some Joycean epiphany, but epiphany is made impossible by the philosophy"
2,A laugh riot,"Here's the idea: There is only one correct way for people to relate to the world around them, and that's through reason. There's only one correct way for people to relate to other people, and that's through reason. Those who understand this are superior to everyone else in every human endeavor, including making hamburgers. The rest are just annoying obstacles, also-rans. The joke is that Rand explains all of this in the context of an incredibly bad science fiction novel, thus placing herself squarely in the camp of the also-rans by her own definition. Whatever the merits of the philosophy, having the main character explain them in a 60-page speech is just a wretched plot device. And the philosophy ultimately reduces to a tautology, although it takes an awful long time to do so."
1,Do NOT Buy This eBook!!,"My hands were tied ...I began to re-read in paperback (1200+ pages); absolutely hooked again. I had to travel and needed the more portable Kindle format. Unfortunately, I had only one choiceAtlas Shrugged: (Centennial Edition)... $18.00+!!!! The publisher should be absolutely ashamed of this price.On the other hand, in keeping with Ms. Rand's theme, I guess a publisher should charge as it chooses.And in keeping with my theme - we should pay as we choose, and $18.00+ for ANY ebook should never be a choice - unless, of course, you are subject to a serious lapse in any good judgement, as was I!I should not have paid this outrageous price. Nor, in my humble opinion, should you!Note to publishers: [eBooks?? Damn the reader! Full steam ahead! They'll buy whatever we give them ... and pay our prices too!!] is leaving a very bad taste with the readers ... your customers! I do believe we will remember your gouging for a long time to come."
1,Great book - rip off price for kindle edition,"Kindle edition way too expensive, 3 times price of paperback, more than hardcover. Many errors in kindle edition. Great book."
4,retraction of complaint and rating,I recently wrote a review that was in error and I'm writing to retract my comments which were harsh. I was of the belief that the bookseller was negligent and lacking in response to my complaint. I now understand the circumstances for my original complaint and I am wrong in my admonishement.
2,I Expected Better,"Ayn Rand's prose is enjoyable to read and the story has some nice imagery. The concepts seem tired and dated, decades after it was written."
3,Atlas Shrugg on CD,Product arrived promptly. I had a little trouble getting use to the narrator but finally got into the book around track 8 of disc 1.I am listening to this for book club. It takes about 50 minutes to get through each disc. This was a good purchase for me sinceI spend a lot of time driving and don't have time to read a 1500 page book.
3,Atlas Shrugged - just so-so.,"I bought this book because I was told that it was a good story about capitalism. Obviously it was fiction and in my opinion it was just exactly that - fiction. I didn't think it was realistic at all and it did not live up to my expectations based on what others had told me. Others liked it a lot, but I thought it was just ""okay."" Knowing what I know now, I would not buy it."
2,One of the Most Overrated Books of All Time,"Don't get me wrong, I respect Atlas Shrugged for the moral and philosophical points that it brings up, but it doesn't work as well as an actual story. It's overlong, bloated and filled with incomprehensible dialogue that really takes me out of the world the author's trying to create. I like some of the dystopian art deco imagery but it all just feels like it would've worked better as a non-fiction with some characters to use as examples to drive the message than its own fictoinal entity."
5,Great book,Everyone should read this book. Makes you rethink who should be appreciated. We need to be careful who we attack
5,Fantastic work that needs to be reread again and again!,"If I didn't know any better, I would swear that Ayn Rand had a crystal ball that allowed her to see sixty years into the world's political future. Atlas Shrugged is a seminal work in modern philosophy that clearly solidified my political perspective and defined my personal values. The story is so riveting that 63 hours of dedicated reading pass with no effort. I absolutely recommend this book and if you've read it in high school/college, read it again. I'm sure the news of the world today and the role you play in it will take on a whole new meaning through the context of Ayn Rand's genius mind."
5,"Atlas Shrugged on CD - The Cure For The ""Morning Zoo"" Radio","I purchased the ""Atlas Shrugged"" on CD. It is amazing how certain passages have more meaning when read aloud. It always amazes me when people attack this book, rather than argue against it, which is exactly what the book predicts! I have applied many of these principles in my role as manager - respect your co-workers as valuable in and of themselves; treat people like they can produce to their highest level; expect greatness from everyone - and my office is exploding! This is the second most positive self-help book ever written (""The Fountainhead"" is the first, since it focuses on the individual.) I so prefer listening to books on CD rather than the ""morning zoo"" or ""afternoon drive time"" radio."
5,One of the finest books written in the modern era.,"Should be read by every one. I first read it as a teenager and thought it was THE BOOK to end all books. After 8 more readings and 7 decades of life, this is still an excellent read. The book should be thought of as a belief process that should be balanced with the pragmatism of daily life."
4,Deeply Flawed Thinking; Great Pulp,"I must say from the outset that I am not an Objectivist, but I do share many beliefs with objectivists, specifically regarding trade and markets. Atlas is a thoroughly enjoyable novel: it is not a work of philosophy, or economics, but a work of pulp that has many merits (Francisco d'Anconia's money speech, for example).That said, Objectivism is totally asinine and inept as a philosophy. For a far more intelligent discussion of the foundations and importance of free markets and private property, see F.A. Hayek, ""The Constitution of Liberty"" and Milton Friedman, ""Capitalism and Freedom."""
5,Quote,"To those who believe that Rand is excessively extreme, I will quote her, twice.""There are two sides to any conflict, one is right and one is wrong, but the middle is always evil.""""In any compromise between bread and poison the only party served can be death.""If these seem vague or incorrect, I would suggest rereading the book or thinking logically. Because, after all, if you can't give reasons for your thoughts, by what right do you give your thoughts at all?"
5,Even better the second time around,"I love this book. In fact it is my #1 favorite book of all time. I liked it the first time and I loved it the 2nd time around. How I felt after the 10th time reading it is indescribable.That said, some people haven't even read it once! I can't believe that. You guys have no idea what you are missing. This is a great book. Read it. It's a long book, but well worth it."
2,cd quality,"Got the book cds in a timely fashion but am super disappointed in the quality of the cd. I can only play it on one (out of three) vehicle's cd play and not at all on a portable player I've used for many other books on cd. Got one other book that has the same problem and is from Blackstone audio books as well. The reader's voice is o.k., have heard better."
3,Just something to consider...,"The review of lawless@topmail.de from Estonia mirrors my own in many ways, but I wish to add another note if I may.Ayn Rand published Atlas Struggled after her much beloved husband passed away; she was admittedly depressed at the time and perhaps (in my humble opinion) this added to the depressive nature of this work. Of course this is only speculative, but I didn't find her previous writings to be of such a deep-vained negative nature. Hey, we are only human; brilliantly talented philosophers included. Overall, I still believe that she was one of the most important authors of this century and it's worth reading her works."
1,Philosophy if you do not think,"My title says it all. This book may be the most simplistic take on humanity ever written and thus does appeal to the masses as ""philosophy"". Utter garbage, but it is the tome that many doomsday right wingers are quoting so it is worth reading to understand their paranoia.Do everyone a favor, go read Adam Smith if you really want an education on capitalism. Mr. Smith would probably laugh at Rand's foolish take on his ideas."
2,Miss Taggart is incorrect,"Begging the pardon of Miss Dagny Taggart, but - railroad magnate or no - she is quite incorrect.Miss Rand did indeed believe in a 'higher power'. More precisely, she believed in two of them: the 'benevolent universe' ('existence', the 'facts of reality') and the human being (including and especially herself).In her attempted rejection of G-d she merely parcelled out the Divine attributes between these two 'higher powers' (for example, 'existence' is eternal, and 'man' is self-creating). I object to the foundations of her 'philosophy' not because she failed to believe in any 'higher power' but because she believed in the wrong one(s).Miss Taggart's own Member Page includes the following remark: 'My whole life is a contradiction'. Indeed, so was Miss Rand's - though I hardly think she would approve of her ATLAS SHRUGGED protagonist's namesake thus acquiescing to irrationality!"
3,Limited approval,"Ayn Rand is a superb writer with amazing talent. Unfortunately she belabors her point, again and again and again. She could have covered the same in four hundred pages rather than eleven hundred pages."
4,Atlas Shrugged,"I heard of this book a long time ago and finally decided to make the plunge. It is long and wordy but extremely well done. Though published over 50 years ago, it is very telling as to what this country, and the world faces today brought on by massive government intrusion into our everyday lives. Ayn Rand, originally from Russia saw the fall and collapse of her country due to communism, socialism and liberal attitudes. She tried to warn us. Alas, no one apparently listened.This novel should be on everyone's ""Bucket List""."
1,Atlas Shrugged,"Written by an atheist, this is one of the most insidious and diabolically anti-Christian book ever written. Satan couldn't have done a better job of attacking Christian principles. Like wandering through the maze mind of a sociopath, it's one of the most repetitive, repulsive and boring books ever writtenIf you liked Mein Kempf, you'll love Atlas Shrugged."
1,Make no mistake,Rand masks a fascist philosophy with an argument against socialism. If you choose to read this self-righteous snooze fest feel free but in the real world (assuming you decide to model your life ala objectivism) you can't do it.
5,Greatest Novel Ever,"Atlas Shrugged is a profound intellectual journey that is interlaced with a can't-put-it-down mystery action story.I've read and listened to this great novel many times. And each time I enjoy it more because I understand it on a deeper level. If you rush through this book, you are really doing yourself a great disservice. Take your time and think about what you are reading. You will be changed for the better if you do."
1,Howard Dean is smarter than Ayn Rand,"I'm currently writing a novel titled ""Atlas Hugged"" that shows the creators of the world being nice and giving, instead of being selfish. It's just what's need, along with Howard Dean, to save this country. I hope that when Ayn Rand writes her next novel, she tones it down a bit and shows some compassion. Hey Ayn, it would also be nice to include God and family in your next novel. Duh!Go Howard Dean!"
4,Atlas Shrugged,"I am enjoying the book and getting much more out of it then when I was forced to read it for a class. I love the speedy service I get when ordering things from Amazon. The ""one click to buy"" is great."
5,A+ The Best book I've ever read!,"Wow! I've read this book twice now, as well as The Fountainhead, Night of January 16th, Anthem, and many of Ayn Rand's other philosophical books. This book has changed the way I look at the world. Ayn Rand had the ability to weave philosophy into a story line to create a masterpiece. When you read some philosophies, you feel as if you are preached at. Ayn Rand backs-up every point no matter how minute with concrete evidence. She gives many examples of what happens when a person deliberately refuses to listen to reason.Since writing this novel, many of the laws that were writen in the book to demonstrated what would happen if unnecessary laws, taxes, etc.. are actually in effect! (I read that somewhere in one of Rand's other books that she later wrote.)This is truly an incredible book!"
5,Wonderful Book,"It's amazing that, even though it was written in the 50's, people are still saying and doing things that it warns of (in the earlier parts of the book). Especially in this economic climate in which the government has taken unprecedented control over companies and the individuals that run them, Rand's words of caution ring as true as ever. Although the idea of a business utopian society described leaves a lot of practical questions unanswered as far as large scale adoption, the ideas about individualism and property rights are very close to my heart. I was inspired by some of the characters in this book. Although I didn't agree with every sentiment, I think that there is a lot more that's right in this book than not. Despite a lengthy monologue near the end, it reads really fast too."
4,Only Liberals,"This book is too liberal for extremely conservative people. If you are open-minded you will enjoy reading this book, but if you are narrow-minded and too conservative(not saying Conservatives are bad), you will NOT enjoy this book. This book is an excellent peace of literature and makes you think. There are some things I don't like about this book. For example, some of these peoples' personalities you will never see in anyone and they are too unintelligent and one-dimensional. But, I do agree that you cannot show too much sympathy, even to family, or you will not succeed in the business world. As a 14 year old, I found this book to be well-written, and it truly does make you think. (Yes, I understood it quite well)."
2,The Whole Truth,"I read the book twice. Once when 16 and again at 23. I was introduced to the book by a drug dealer who had Rand's ""sayings"" printed on all his apartmernt walls. He had bought several hundred copies to hand out to everyone! I got hypnotized. After graduating college, I read it again and wondered why it was so impossible to actually live up to Rand's grand standards. I then found out Rand was an atheist. This affected my opinion of her. Later I discovered the real way to live on [...]. The Foundation of Human Understanding enabled me to live my beliefs without hypocrisy by guiding me to the Creator. Rand turns out to have been a waste of time. A wrong road taken. Brandon and alot of other intellectual types were misled by her. Glad I discovered fhu."
3,Great for Cranky Curmudgeons,"What's sad is that so many people think this book mirrors real life. Dear readers, do you think that Ayn Rand would classify any of you as a Hank Rearden or a Dagny Taggart, or even less, as an Ayn Rand? I frankly found the book hard to read with her pessimistic and whining tone. I wonder what made her so angry."
3,I liked this fundamentally evil book,"I completely disagree with the premise of the book. Clearly it is written by a sociopath for sociopaths. If you believe that you are not your brother's keeper, this is the book for you. It is decently written and at times overly descriptive (which is typical of Ayn Rand.) The book has an astonishing way of making caring human beings into annoying piss ants and sex sound like rape play. With Ayn Rand up is down and black is white and the clever way she glorifies this mentality is worth the price of the book. Read this book if you want to know the mindset of those who seek to enrich themselves while simultaneously destroying the world that they ""built."" Read this book if you want to understand those who are convinced to stand against their own economic, social and moral interests. Who is John Galt? Why he is Satan himself."
3,Intelligent but flawed author,"Her idealogy was only valid in a time of a real or imagined communist/socialist/collectivist threat. She apparently wanted to change the world -- and extremes (masked as objective ""realities"") are so much better for herding than real political nuances."
2,"All of her FOLLOWERS are ""thinking"" for themselves, eh?","Danielle Steel loving the sweatshops, drinking dogma and dollar signs, with liberty (to think exactly like her) and justice for all (for colonizers anyway).A fascist who hates fascists. Hates competition?Writes characters that she hopes will help justify her lack of ethics. --""I've met him,"" he told her, Hollywood 50s potboiler tune playing in the background. ""I don't blame you.""All her world's a shopping mall, and we're just consumers."
4,"Atlas Shrugged: lengthy, wordy, difficult read at times",Ann Rand has captured a virtual history book of the 2000's and it was written in 1957.I was taken by how her writting is almost a reflection of our current world breakdown. If you want to see what could and in some instances is happening to the US and the World this is your book. Again written in 1957.It is a long read with runon and wordyness but captures an unbeleivable picture of today.
5,"philosophically intense, intellectually stimulating!","No book has touched my soul like the way ""Atlas Shrugged"" did. As I traveled back in time, I realized that my innermost and most-kept philosophy has been put into words by Ayn Rand years before I was even born and she couldn't have put it more aptly. Moreover, this is the only book which has made me assess my own philosophy and principles and I discovered that somewhere, somehow, I was more like the character of James Taggart, emotional and sentimental. But as I plunged deeper into understanding myself I realized that I am Hank Rearden in many ways. I have actually been in many, similar situations with Mr. Rearden. Yes, this book has awakened me."
2,"I have more important things in my life, do you?","Sure, this book makes you think. And sure, it makes you look at life in a different way, but what was so wrong with the way we were looking at life before? Life is too short to spend philosophizing. Enjoy yourself, and enjoy others. You don't want to be lying on your death bed contemplating philosophical theories, do you? I, personally, would much rather be thinking about my family, my friends, and how I had enjoyed my life thusfar. I don't know about the rest of you, but I need something more concrete in my life than Ayn Rand's theory of Objectivism that she portrays in the excessively long novel of her life, ATLAS SHRUGGED."
5,Thought-provoking,"Although I do not agree entirely with EVERYTHING in this book, it was very thought-provoking and entertaining. I couldn't put it down. I would highly recommend this book!! I think for those who have not liked it, they might have if they read it with an open mind. After all, how many books have you read that you have agreed with and liked every word written??"
5,One of The Great Novels,"I first read Atlas Shrugged almost 30 years ago on the advice of a friend, who described it as the best book he had ever read. I also found it to be in that class. It had a profound effect on me. I was moved by it toward a (even more) conservative view of politics and econimics, to the extent of becoming a little too ""mean-spirited"" and maybe a little paranoid.I realize now that Ms. Rand is considered by some, accurately in my estimation, to have been an extremist . . . in the extreme. She was also an atheist, which viewpoint leaves one without hope outside of this world. Notwithstanding, her message regarding the liberal, anti-business, free lunch crowd rings through with refreshing clarity and plainly spoken truth. There is much wisdom in her ""objectivist"" philosophy and as a bonus, this story wraps it in an epic, hard-to-put-down novel.This is one of the great books of the 20th century. Recommended."
2,Atlas Shrugged,"I was excited to get my copy of Atlas Shrugged. It came in paperback form and was reasonably priced. The only real problem with the book is the type is so small that I cannot read it...kind of like the extremely small print in Amazons 'The Fine Print"" rules!! So much for small factor paperbacks!!"
4,Amazing,"Well this is a long book and I'm taking my time with it so I'm only about half way through when Amazon requested a review in an e-mail. But since I'll forget later I simply must respond now. There are times when I'm reading in this book, written in the 40's I think, my own current events. Orwell saw the potential future in 1984 but I think Rand shows us how we get there."
2,"Good story, poorly told","I have read this book twice and still like it a lot. I have a signed copy of this great book.Even in the first two CD's the CD's present the story out of proper sequence and repeats large sections of the story. I am dissapointed in the making of the CD!Great story, poorly told! I wish I had known of this problem before I purchased it."
3,switched,"I did not recive the edition of the book I ordered.Then was offered a chance to send it back and pay ten dollars for an edition that one could read with out a magnifyer glass.Make sure you dont order the fiftyth edition of Atlas Shrugged, you will not be able to read it with out a magnafryer glass.Fast service,New book,just coulnt read it."
2,Because of Ayn Rand I almost became a Socialist,"I finally gave up reading this rather boring book when Rand had a musical composer leave society and join the Rocky Mountain Millionaire's retreat. Rand doesn't understand what motivates artists because she isn't an artist. She has a kind of denatured creativity and the capacity to get people thinking about certain ideas, which is not easy to do, so I give her book 2 stars (instead of just one)."
2,Well written with a dreadful underlying philosophy,"I would reccommend this book to anyone who wishes to understand why people believe in Capitalism. It is unpersuasive, mainly due to the fact that it is fiction, and therefore Rand can have the economy of her world act on her every whim. She also fails to present decent arguments of the other side of the ""utopian economy"" question, and therefore Rand falls into the Straw Man logical fallacy.The plot of Atlas Shrugged is very good, and it keeps the readers attention. It is long, and requires a lot of time to soak in the outlandish ideas presented. Many times Rand's heartless philosophy made me sick to my stomach. So enjoy it (if that's possible)!"
5,This is probably the only hope for western civilization,There are plenty of wonderful reviews covering the essential points. I would like to add my self to the list of people that completely love this book.
1,Kindle price is rediculous,"My objection to this book is for the publishers pricing of the Kindle version. It's almost $5 MORE than the library binding and almost TWICE the cost of paperback! In fact, the Kindle version is now the most expensive way to read this book! Something is wrong with that! I've seen this several times recently, and it will kill the e-book market. The main advantage of the e-book has been that it's been a great deal for everyone. Publishers expand their market with very little additional expense, and readers get the book for (often) about half-price. Now that the Kindle has become popular, however, several publishers are trying to charge MORE for the privilege of reading their book on an e-book format. I love my Kindle, but I will not pay more for a Kindle version than a hard-copy. If I want to read this book, I'll pick it up at a used bookstore, or check it out of the library for free."
1,I want my stolen time back,"After finishing this book, I am so disappointed that I wish there would be a way I could sue the author for my stolen time with such crap. The story is weak, lame and a completely worthless piece of junk and makes a shameless attempt to deliver her lunatic philosophy."
1,UNFAIR KINDLE PRICE!!,"I read this book in paperback and later bought a hardcover edition. It is one of the best books I haver EVER read! This review is for the Kindle Edition, price $19!! You have GOT to be joking!! I wanted to buy the Kindle version because I want to read this book again! It deserves FIVE STARS! You, The Publisher, deserve NO STARS at all!!I am a libertarian, you are free to set your price as I am free NOT to buy your product!Note: There is a Kindle price of $11 bucks but not if you are in the US!!!"
3,A European perspective:Compare Ayn Rand with Charles Dickens,"Yes I understand Ayn Rand's ideas: he who works harder should earn more than the lazybones - and that this necessary for an efficient economy. Yes, I also believe freedom and the dignity of the individual to be more important than the repressive, suffocating collectivism that you can find in communist or in islamic societies. In so far, Ayn Rand is right.On the other hand this radical egoism Ayn Rand propagates makes me shiver sometimes. I always have to think about the ""Christmas Carol"" by Charles Dickens and the main character of this story, Ebenezer Scrooge when reading Ayn Rand's philosophical ideas.So this is my suggestion to all objectivists: Read ""A Christmas Carol"" by Charles Dickens every christmas and think about what Ebenezer Scrooge was shown by the three ghosts, the ghost of the past, the ghost of the present and the ghost of the future, in order not to become too fanatical in the philosophy of objectivism."
2,Stalemate,"If you don't vote republican, you probably won't agree with Ayn Rand's philosophy. And if you don't agree with her philosophy, chances are you'll find this story unnecessarily long-winded and boring. That, at least, is my personal impression of this particular work.This story is a collection of plots and sub-plots, which all drive home the same point: pure capitalism is the way to go, and any attempt at governmental interference will stifle growth and hurt society as a whole. I'm afraid my attention and interest waned after experiencing blunt trauma to my head from this mantra for the hundredth and seventeenth time - particularly since I do not agree with it and believe there's ample evidence to the contrary.This is probably one of those literary works you either love or hate. I'm afraid I find myself on the latter end of the scale."
1,Yuck!,"Rand must dwell in a special kind of a world -- one that discounts 99.9% of its inhabitants contribution to a functioning society. In rare moments, the book is compelling and exciting; for the most part, it's a 1000+ page rant on objectivism. I've never read a book that I seriously considered quitting after page 900 -- until I encountered Atlas Shrugged, that is. This reviewer strongly recommends that you read something else!"
2,"Oh, dear.","I wanted so badly to love this book. Really, I did. I adore Ayn Rand's ideas, and I'm more than convinced of the moral rectitude of her mission, but--WHY, OH WHY, did it have to be so BADLY WRITTEN? I've read almost all of these reviews--the ones that proclaim it a new Truth and Light, and the ones that say it's inspired by Satan himself--and my primary issue is that the prose is tortured and unimaginative.By the middle of the book, I was so tired of people saying things ""coldly"" or ""mockingly"" I was ready to throw the book across the room. Yes, yes, yes, and Jim Taggarts lines are always ""screamed"" or ""whined."" We got the picture by page 40, Ms. Rand.She needed a very good editor, and she undermined her own philosophy by claiming to value only the best of everything and then submitting a work of ""art"" that is in every way artistically inferior.Too bad.Incidentally, I adored ""South Park's"" recent take on this book. And agreed."
3,A long diatribe,It was exhausting to read the John Galt radio speech. This represented an elongated look into a heart (Her own) of bitterness to established religion. I understood the fire about an evil form of socialism. The other had no real substance.
4,Good Book,"Its a very philosophical book, readers will enjoy it more if they really think about what she writes. Many people find her views on life pretty liberating. I'm probably not the best guy to talk about it but she advocates 'enligthened selfishness'. In fact her main characters are a little too self-absorbed in my view. Its pretty entertaining, and she does present her arguments very well. So even if I disagree with her views, I feel I've become a better person just by reading it."
5,Awareness,"This book is one of the most influential books in my life. I read it when I was 16 years old, at a time when I started trying to define my personal philosophy and ethics. I was reading several political philosophy books at the time; Rand's was morally, ethically, and politically incredibly consistent. She is truly a revolutionary genius and for too long has been placed on the sidelines of the so-called intelligentsia. But there are a host of incredibly accomplished thinkers who believe otherwise. This book successfully popularized a complex political and philosophical argument, in a romantic, passionate way. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND to anyone interested in THINKING."
2,I don't think so.,"It is no wonder why Ayn Rand is anti-education.Her worst enemies are those who possess the ability to think for themselves and not blindly follow her every word.It is also no mystery why many of the positive reviews regarding this book were submitted by teenagers.Keep dreamin', Rand!"
1,Could have been shorter.,"And here's the short version.Q: Why did the non-Objectivist chicken cross the road?A: To mooch off the productive achievements of the Objectivist chickens who had shown the way to the other side.Fortunately, since A is A, the non-Objectivist chickens all died when a train tunnel collapsed on them."
5,a timeless tale of philosophical wonder,"i'd say ayn rand's ""atlas shrugged"" is one of the best novels of all time. yes, it is quite long and tiring to read, but once you close the book there is a certain feeling of awe and wonder that remains in your soul. i'd say anyone who says ""atlas shrugged"" as being 'pointless' do not see the underlying message it brings to life. an open mind is needed in order to fully benefit from any of rand's writings. i highly recommend it!"
2,"Great ideas, mediocre story-telling","I just finished reading this book last night. I think the philosophy she describes and lives by is a brillant adaptation of Adam Smith. The novel is very Melville-like in it's description of the most minute detail of the mundane. Be prepared to wrestle through some very dry pages to get to the meat.The only idea in the book I disagree with is the fact that the 4 good (productive) men that the main character interacts with (Franciso, John Galt, Hank Readren, & Eddie Willers) are all, not only in love with her, but utterly smitten. I bought it up to the point where she hooked up with Hank Rearden. Then she hooks up with John Galt and Eddie tells her he loves her (no hookup there). I know it is a foolish thing to pick at."
4,Objectivisim has its own limitations !!,"Ayn Rand has to the only author that has moved me so much through her writings. But, ""The Fountainhead"" was an epic and ""Atlas Shrugged"" is not even near it. Though, its a good read going through lives of Hank Rearden and Dagny Taggart, it does not do justice to the overall concept.The end of the book is a big letdown. The emergence of John Galt and the story henceforth drags at an impossible pace. The number of characters are also more and the plot more complicated than it deserves.The 4 stars for the book is for Hank Rearden and Dagny. I loved them till they made their presence felt."
2,Looooooooooooooong,"If you ask me, Rand was a long winded bore who could have spent more of her time figuring out just what objective reality is, rather than going around claiming to be the greatest human being ever. Her philosophy is not particularly original and her disciples are just as dogmatic as those they often criticize. As for the book, its a long and tedious read with a 100 page speech summarizing Rand's philosophy that can for the most part be skipped. It's almost as big as her ego. To be honest, I've read better pulp SF with essentially the same plot and philosophy but a whole heck of a lot more fun."
3,Purchased for my brother,I haven't read this book. But my brother said he had heard so many people talk about it that he wanted it for Christmas. He wanted it; he got it!!
2,not wirtten for a mature audience,"The focus of the book, as everyone probably already knows, is on the individual and the evils or limiting nature of socializm. This is an interesting and currently, widely held philosophy that represents the basis for some political platforms. While it is not important whether I agree or disagree with this perspective, it is of note that the book appears to be written for a 6th grade audience and has simplistic, sometimes child-like characters that become of little interest as the book drones on.I guess that I was expecting more and can understand why this book didn't do well with an educated public."
5,Fiction to Fact in 52 Years,"""The highest tribute to Ayn Rand, abundantly in evidence here, is that her critics must distort everything she stood for in order to attack her. She advocated reason, not force; the individual's rights to freedom of' action, speech, and association; self-responsibility, NOT self-indulgence;' and a live-and-let-live society in which each individual is treated as an END, not the MEANS of others' ends. How many critics would dare honestly state these ideas and say, "" . . .and that's what I reject""?"
2,Really?,"I agree that you don't have to own a philosophy to read and understand it. But this was some of the worst writing I've encountered, turgid prose at its best. Women who only want to be ""taken"", an elite group who believe they have the only answers and of course, a saviour who comes to take them away from a world that doesn't appreciate them. Really? When people reduce others to ""looters and leeches"", that should give the reader insight to the lack of depth in the philosophy. But given our current political climate, it's no wonder this book is so popular."
1,"Weak, even for a Nietzschean","Atlas Shrugged is neither a masterpiece of philosphy nor a great novel. I do not hate Ayn Rand, I just pity her and her followers, for they consider this book one of the greatest works of philosophy ever written. This is just a popular novel, and as far as philosophy is concerned, Nietzsche's philosophy on the individual remains unmatched to this day. Thanks to posterity, Atlas Shrugged and the other works of Rand will, sooner or later, fall into oblivion, for that is what happens to everything that pleases only the common herd and the pseudo-intellectuals."
2,"Some good ideas, but lacks subtlety","I thought the whole premise of the book was interesting. Rand objected to the belief that economic freedom should be sacrificed to some vague higher goal of ""fairness"" or ""brotherhood"" or ""leveling the playing field"". But I don't agree with her extreme philosophy of ""every man for himself, let the strongest and smartest survive."" I was quite disappointed that someone who was supposed to be so smart and such a deep thinker didn't argue both sides, or apply her philosophy in a more subtle, complex manner. It was more just ""You're a loser if anything you do is not motivated by self-interest."" One can't really enjoy the book, or be provoked to thought, because the book is so overstated, black-and-white, villain vs. superhero."
1,propaganda disguised as a novel,"In _Atlas_, Rand earnestly seeks to illustrate that rich people deserve their wealth--that there is a direct correlation between virtue and earning power. This is a hopelessly simplistic philosophy, little more than propaganda.Rand seems to have no grasp that the social circumstances one is born into has a huge impact on how far one can climb. She tries to avoid such an objection by having Dagny Taggart refuse to cash in on her inherited privelege, choosing instead to make her own way.But inheritance isn't always privelege. What if Taggart's ""inheritance"" was a disabled mother and three younger siblings? Would we cheer when she disavowed them to strike out on her own?Close your _Atlas_ and pick up George Eliot's _Middlemarch_: she is a writer that understands not only that human interdependence a fact, but that it can be an ennobling one."
3,"Read it, enjoy it, and move on","It's a good story, but it gets a little long-winded sometimes. It's got some good ideas, and some bad ideas. It's got good writing, and bad writing. So has any other book. It's worth reading - it's probably even worth buying - but it's not worth basing your life on. Just read it, enjoy it, and move on."
2,Isn't It Ironic?,"For a book that celebrates excellence in workmanship, it is ironic that the Kindle version of this book is so poorly formatted. The main problems seem to be centered on punctuation although there are some typos.I first read this book in high school and wanted to see if it made the same impact 40 years later. While I enjoyed it again I found it to be bloated - saying the same thing over and over again. What could be said in a paragraph or two is stretched over 5-10 pages. All right - we get it!"
3,book club book,"I selected this book because I had a boss 30 years ago that said it was the best book she ever read. I suggested it for my book club book but didn't check to see how long it was. I find it hard to wade through all the muck to get to the story. Clearly the author was from Russia born in 1905 and saw much suffering which affected her writing. If I had it to do over, I would just go see the movie.There will be some interesting ideas to discuss at our meeting. People will have very differing opinions about how to treat the poor. Ayn Rand and Mother Teresa were at opposite ends of the spectrum."
4,Atlas Shrugged: (Centennial Edition),"I am still reading the book and am about 65% through. It seems to describe, sort of, the way our country is headed under Mr Obama. It appears there is no way around a more socilist government with out the complete colapse that the book is showing. I recomend it."
3,Long winded (ultimate points could have been made in 1/3 the length).Not sure why.,Famous book. Not sure why. Look online: I used it for toilet paper when tortured in a Serbian prison (no joke).
5,Ayn Rand,exactly what I wanted. It's a tough read but of course I knew it would be. None of her books are easy. the price was right. Thanks
3,A Paradox,"This is my second reading of Atlas Shrugged, decades apart from the first. I can still appreciate Ms Rand's arguments for her political and economic philosophy even if I do not agree with all of them. However, the rationale for her philosophy of human relationships escapes me. She appears to be applying the competitive, egoistic moral code used in her business model to human relations. After reading of Dagny and Hank's escapades and conversations in the bedroom, I closed my Kindle thinking that these are two very troubled human beings."
2,Like trudging through a 2-foot snow drift,"I read this book during presidential election season to see what all the ""fuss"" was about. I've read some ofAyn Rand's writings and am familiar with her philosophy but I've not read one of her novels.After wading through 1,000 pages I have to say I'm amazed that this novel is so popular and enduring. OK, I get it that Rand is a materialist, but she's sucked all the life out of this novel by making it such a relentless polemic. Quite ironically it occurred to me while reading ""Atlas"" that it has all the esthetic appeal of socialist realist art from the Soviet era.There's NO nuance or subtlety here. The characters lack the complex motivations and emotions of real life. The individualist heroes are flat prototypes and all other characters are weak, conformists totally lacking character and virtue.I just can't take this tome seriously as philosophy or literature."
1,Philosophy for the Tea Party,Reads like a work of *ideology* written by someone who didn't quite grasp any of the great European *philosophers* that she apparently read.
1,Overpriced,Since when have electronic books become more expensive than hard copies? What's going on here? Something is not right with this
3,The Rationalization of the Right in a Nutshell,"'""Do not cry that it is our duty to serve you,"" John Galt says in *Atlas Shrugged*. ""We do not recognize such duty. Do not cry that you need us. We do not consider need a claim.""""We do not need you.""This story is evil characters written for evil characters, but it is a fascinating psychopathological study. Rand articulates the immorality of the Right more effectively than anyone else. If you are looking for a justification to ignore your fellow man, to kick him down the metaphorical stairs, this is it. Who cares if it is a bad story? No one. What matters here are the ideas, which are contemptible. Thank you, Ayn Rand, for laying out for all the World to see the pathetic self-absorption of human beings who find self-absorption attractive. It explains MUCH.I give it three stars because it is not as bad as, say, *C. H. U. D.*, and for its anthropological/psychological significance."
2,"Editor, Please!","I get it, Ayn, I get it! I got it on page 300, again on 400, again on 700, and again on 1010. She's generally dead-on about human behavior, but if you can stomach a 1000+ pp novel filled entirely with speeches and people speaking in full paragraphs, you're a better reader than I. This makes The Ambassadors seem like it was written by Raymond Chandler."
5,I wish I had read/listened to this 30 years ago,"I wish I had a longer commute to work so I could get a larger slice of this every day - 50 CD's is a lot to get through, but it's worth it. It is scary how accurate a depiction of our times this 50+ year old book is."
2,Well...,"You will hear a lot about this book from those on both sides who have never read it. Do yourself a favor and pick it up. It is significant, though certainly not for its literary merit.If you are a lefty, you will find it helpful to know more about what the right believes than most of them do. If you are a Christian Republican, you will learn what the leaders of your party truly think of you. If you are a Tea Partier... well, just read this book and hopefully you will not be anymore.If you have ever wondered how Europe could have allowed Hitler to rise, it was because they did not read Mein Kamf (though many bought it to put on their bookshelves) and the people listened, instead, to the passion of the speeches given. They mistook emotion for reason, rhetoric for truth.Do yourself a favor and read this book. The race for the post 2016 world is already on."
2,Heavy Handed,"I couldn't put this book down because I was determined to prevail through 1050 pages of tedious and repetitive preaching. The characters are distinctly unlikeable and the plot is ridiculous. It is a difficult story to enjoy, especially because of Rand's absolute and extreme ideology."
2,Revealing of Rand's Sociopathic Nature,"If you have nothing better to do, then by all means, read this book. It offers insight to the sociopathic mind of it's author where compassion is eschewed for the self. It is long. It repeats many of the same objectivist themes over and over again to the point of ad-nausium. I found myself repeatedly thinking ""yeah, I get it, you never learned to share"".Folks, do yourselves a favor and download the audio book instead. That way you can listen while doing far more productive activities and spare yourself the feeling of having wasted so much time!"
5,"Not4profit, either, I suppose.","The productive individuals' antagonists, you twit, imposed their overbearing ""directives"" not because of their intrinsic evil, but because they were too stupid to do anything else with their lives and they thought they knew what is best for the world.Not4prophet, didn't you notice when you opened the book that there were no black-outlined figures on the pages for you to color in? No clowns and rainbows for you to delightfully chararcterize with the red and green hues of your Crayolas? I think you may have picked up the wrong book, comrade.5 Freaking Stars. Read it with your mind, not the indignant frustration that you feel for being yourself.Attack her philosophy, moron. Not the other readres' lak uv speling an' grammer scills;"
2,BORING,"Rand should have written a philosophy book instead of a novel. It's repetitive, preachy, and tedious. Not to mention her characters are totally 1 dimensional and she obviously has a terrible intolerance for any ambiguity. Do yourself a favor and read The Fountainhead if you want Rand without the sermon."
3,Sloppy Kindlization,"A pity that the publisher (Penguin) chose to emulate Orren Boyle instead of Hank Reardon when releasing this to Kindle. It's obviously a scanned-in copy without the benefit of proofreading or even rudimentary spell-check. ""John Galt"" comes out ""John Gait"" repeatedly; punctuation is unrecognizable; words are arbitrarily broken in two; non-words are created when the scanner encounters broken serifs or tightly spaced letters. This was my fourth read of this classic, and I was disappointed in the utter lack of publisher's care. Considering that the Kindle edition costs more than the paperback, I feel cheated. The book itself is wonderful."
5,ahhh now its a movie,"I got his book years ago, and now its a movie.I still think the NWO is in control of everything, and I think they wanted this to come out so people would think how crazy we are.In the end, the good guys win and the bad guys lose right?Well depends on what book your reading........"
4,Good experience,All the information posted about the product was accurate. Was promised that it would be shipped and delivered within a particular time frame and it worked out perfectly.I would purchase from this seller again.
2,Not what I expected,"It has been many, many years since I first read Atlas Shrugged, and I have been looking forward to purchasing the audiobook to listen to on my long commute to and from work each day. The book is contained on 50 (Yes, FIFTY) CD's, and when I set the first 5 discs and started the CD player, I was extremely disappointed to quickly learn that the man reading the audiobook has the most annoying voice I have heard in quite some time. He is overly dramatic and even changes his pitch at times when reading female characters' dialogue. I am going to listen through to the end -- I'm only on disc 5 today -- but this is a real disappointment."
4,"Brisk, well-plotted, and insightful...","""Atlas Shrugged"" is Rand's masterpiece achievement. It features brisk pace (despite its large size), well-crafted plot, piercing insights into modern political and philosophical problems, plus (as a bonus) slightly dubious character motivation. In fact, I thoroughly enjoyed the novel and agreed with most of the things it had to say, but frankly, John Galt put me off. (John Galt is almost the sole reason I use four rather than five stars). He is a totally one-sided character, and he has become such a myth by the end that the mere mention of his name as an actual character seems bald and brazen. (My favorite character, admittedly, was Ragnar Danneskjold). The villains were portrayed well, especially as character prototypes (I am sure Ms.Rand had a lot of experience with them). But nevermind that, its well worth the read and the thorough round of contemplation that it invariably brings with it. A fine work."
4,Funnier than the Bible,"The best aspect of reading this book today is the amusing corollaries to our very own Clinton government. I could rate it a 7 on humor alone for its embarrassing, yet hilarious, characterization of what's going on in America. From the attempt to choke us with a bossy health care system to its limited success in promoting racial set-asides, the Clinton government is the government of Atlas Shrugged. Fortunately for us, however, the book is an extreme exaggeration of reality -- the establishment is far too incompetent to control us as well as it does in the novel, and for that matter we don't have any John Gaults. The book presents an ideological archetype, a form. A reader can get a lot out of a form by recognizing where and how it applies in his own life. Don't cheat yourself of a good read (and some good humor) by dwelling on the writer's personal inconsistencies, the atheism or the stark imagery. Read it like the Bible. Read it for its ideas."
2,"Try ""The Fountainhead"" instead...","...it's shorter and reads better.I managed to get through about three quarters of this very long book, but it finally defeated me. Rand's ideas are worth understanding, but the speechifying finally wore me past patience and stamina. The ""tragic"" heroism of the main characters ceased being interesting pretty early in the book.If only Rand had cut this monster down by a third... the writing might have been tighter; the characters, limited in depth though they are, might have had more sharply drawn and entertaining trajectories; and the terribly dated ""bogey and bacall"" posing might have held me if only for historic and nostalgic reasons.I reached a point where I no longer cared how it all turned out.With no small sense of release I quit this volume for good and will not be back."
1,Childish,"There are two novels that can change a bookish fourteen-year old's life: The Lord of the Rings and Atlas Shrugged. One is a childish fantasy that often engenders a lifelong obsession with its unbelievable heroes, leading to an emotionally stunted, socially crippled adulthood, unable to deal with the real world. The other, of course, involves orcs."
3,"Not convinced, but entertaining none the less.","Many people find this book disturbing, shocking, and evil. Others declare it the Bible of capitalism. I found it to be very entertaining. Ayn Rand has made a very creative attempt at justifying what so many people today call ""greedy capitalists"".There is no doubt she has an incredible mind and there is much truth in what she outlines in this book. However, she has failed to convince me that her philosophy of ""Mine, mine, mine"" is a moral one. Rand's view of human beings is objective indeed: they are either moochers or gods. To her, there is nothing in between (a perfectionist fallacy).I recommend this book to anyone, whether they take Rand's words to heart or not."
2,"Over-rated, nice plot, but I don't share the philosophical premise.","I started reading this based on a co-workers philosophy/infatuation. I found it very engaging at first, and tugging at the emotion of those who feel the system is taking advantage of them. After awhile I became largely bored, but driven on by the hope of some very important message. Overall I liked the expression of thoughts, but I don't share the same ambition to have the pendulum of society swing in this direction. I have a hard time correlating this with all the positives of the society I have been blessed to be apart, and I don't feel that the extremisms of this philosophy have a long term benefit to the human condition.In the end the message was based on a search for a Utopian society that so many before have espoused. I can't predict the future, but as times change and become pregnant with new ideas, I pray for a less narrow vision of humanity is embraced by society."
5,As god as ever.,"I read this in school over 40 years ago, still a classic. The message is as true today as ever."
5,Atlas Shrugged - Gread Read,Excellent book. Glad I did not buy the paperback. It is a long book and the print even in this hard cover is small - I can't even imagine how small the print is in paperback. It is a wonderful book - full of what is happening today.
4,Worth Reading,"Wooden dialogue runs through this novel. But Ayn Rand was a major thinker of the last century. Not all socialists or union people are as bad as Ms Rand might have you believe. Most of her views were developed after living many years in the banckupt socialism of communism, so I can understand the uncompromising nature of her writing. The thing I can take from this book is that indivual people can spur society on to better things. And yes, groups of people can blindly follow corrupt leaders who use their groups power to destroy the individuals who can take society to a new and better levelR HemingwayPast Twilight"
5,Loving this book....but I need disc 15!!,"This book is incredible. Even if the story were nonexistent and the topic were boring, I would listen just for her amazingly descriptive writing. But the story is also there (developed very well), and the material is extremely engaging. I often sit in my parked car, not wanting to ""put the book down""!However, disc 15 won't play! Help! Is there anyplace I can download the chapters from disc 15 so I can get on with the story? Thanks!UPDATE: After posting this comment, I found the publishers online (blackstoneaudio.com) and sent an e-mail to their customer service department. I received a response within a day, and they sent me a replacement CD free of charge within a few days after that, free of charge. Now there's some great customer service! Raise my rating to six stars!"
2,100 Words or Less,"Rand appeals to our basic selfish instinct: The strong succeed, the weak leech.That premise is the bulk of her intellectual prowess and many many years ago I found it interesting and alluring. Yet, with maturity, comes a better sense of how this world works.Regardless of all the political focus Rand seems to be getting lately, as a literary work this novel is mildly entertaining two-thirds of the way through and then falls apart. Then it's not about story or plot, it's about indoctrination. It's about propaganda. Okay, that's fine for the pulpit. But really sucks for a novel."
5,A masterpiece whose downfall is lack of characher development.,"This book I could consider a masterpiece-- the story is exhilarating and extremely well structured; it builds on itself and seems only to get better; it is a rewarding and satisfying read.The only flaw for me is that Rand has taken a little too much out of the emotional department in order to convey her philosophical messages-- laisse faire government, the virtue of selfishness, etc. I still really enjoyed the book, but unlike THE FOUNTAINHEAD, this one lacked depth in the characters-- there was little growth for any of them. On the other hand, The Fountainhead fails to be so flawless in story structure. In the end, I much prefer The Fountainhead, but I would still highly recommend this book. It is an awesome literary achievement, even if her philosophy isn't for you."
1,Simply awful,"As fiction, it's pathetic.As political dogma, it's simplistic and misguided.As fuel for a fire, it's functional, unless you buy the Kindle Edition, in which case I can think of no use for it whatsoever."
1,Atlas died of boredom,"and you may very well die of boredom too after you wade through this hyperverbous book.It was such a disappointment. Having read the Fountain Head, I had expectations of a good story and solid characters, instead it was one loopty loop after another and boring from the get-go to the long, long awaited end.If you are a fan of politics and boring books, this is the one for you."
1,Yuck!,"Rand...has created one of the most appallingly simplistic and inadequate philosophies ever. And it's (surprise, surprise) very popular....This novel is overlong in the extreme, full of one-dimensionals, and horribly written. Pure bad with a capital B. BAD.Objectivism (I cringe even dignifying Rand's vision with its proper name) is the purest form of skunking, existentialism's great sin, creating yourself as unique and vital to the world. So even though the two philosophies are often linked (mostly by idiots), they are in direct opposition.If you're looking for literary developments of competent philosophies check out Sartre and Camus. These guys don't pull their punches, and they don't ignore the areas of life that pose problems for their ideologies.To ease up on Rand, she did write a novel I really enjoyed: Anthem. At just over a hundred pages in length, I didn't have time to puke, because she didn't have time to rant, and her constant deployment of first person plural was amusing."
1,"Verbose, Bad","The author makes many false comparisons where one obviously true facet is supposed to prove the rest of an argument is also true -- this is incorrect, if best misleading. Not to mention the extreme verbosity - get to the point already."
1,boring.,i hated the book it was like pouring acid into an eye. i would have rather listened to my dads lecture or die then read thus s***** piece of crap!!
5,Socialism vs Capitalism,"This book, though written in the 1940's, could have been written about today. It is eerily frightening to read Ayn Rand's work and compare it to the things that are happening in the USA today. Reading ""Atlas Shrugged"" today makes one wonder and worry that we could possibly be heading toward the same type of society depicted here. Wish our politicians could be forced to read/reread this work."
1,I Forced Mice Elf To Finish This Book,"Just so I could say with some authority, that it blows. (And I spelled ""myself"" as ""mice elf"" just to rile you objectivists.) Nyuk Nyuk!"
1,Poorly written novel; a terrible waste of a lot of paper,"What a terrible read. Wish I could give it less than one star??? It was far, far, far too long. She wasted a lot of paper. She's a terrible writer. She did a poor job developing the story, probably because she was so focused on conveying her political philosophy. She's so dogmatic that she comes across as preachy and the book absolutely lacks nuance. She hits you over the head with a friggin' sledgehammer with her beliefs throughout the story -- it gave me a headache! My recommendation is that you skip the story and go straight to the explanation of her political philosophy at the end of the book, after the story. Again, what a waste of tons of paper."
1,WORDS HYPNOTIZE,"Like the snake in ""The Jungle Book"" singing ""Trust In Me,"" Rand's words have a hypnotic effect that lull the reader into deadly sleep. She will convince you that she is being perfectly reasonable when she says that selfishness is a virtue, and that ""man's ego is the fountainhead of human progress."" As a matter of fact, she will make YOU feel like a brainless idiot for NOT being a ""capitalistic pig."" Some significant observations in reviews I have read here on amazon.com are that this book is second in popularity only to the bible, and Rand is wildly anti-religion. When you get to the part where her hero erects an enormous golden statue of a dollar sign (think ""golden calf""), be afraid."
2,Some good ideas - shallow characters,If you like the superhero genre this book is for you. The characters are broken up into good guys and bad guys with no grey in between. The good guys are insufferable megalomaniacs that you can't help but want to slap. The bad guys make you wonder how people that are so short-witted and exempt of vision got the positions of power they hold. At the core the ideas that this book tries to illustrate are good but as a story teller Ayn Rand is not for me.
3,Small Print,"The seller did what they promised, so it was not their fault, but the book is very small and so is the print. Don't buy this edition if you have a problem with small print."
1,A very poor book,"Do yourself a favor and read this book, if only to be able to say, ""I read it, and it's garbage."" If I were an individualist libertarian, I would be too embarrassed to have this work on my side."
2,"ME, ME, ME","You can plod through this bloated tome or just read a summary. I'd suggest a summary. And then go ahead and read some Nietzsche instead. Now he was a writer! I personally don't find what is so interesting about Ayn Rand and her ideas. They are not new. And philosophers pay her no attention. Why is that? *Sometimes* the majority is right. Sorry, but we could do without a dead ultra-right, megalomaniacal, pill head, Russian immigrant telling us how to live our lives. Who doesn't think you should live your own life and that it be of your own design just as a matter of principle? How American. And how ironic this Russian woman achieved _cult-like_ status telling Americans they should be more selfish, and not follow others, etc. I have the impression Vladimir Putin is good example of her type of man."
1,"Rand's Commandment:See No Evil, Hear No Evil, Speak No Evil","I would simply like to say that this book stinks. It's a long-winded and malicious treatise by a second-rate demagogue who was about as dense as her devoted followers. She considers the majority of people in this world to be parasites, but it is her self-centered philosophy that is truly parasitical. I would like to say this, but the pro-Rand forces might make enough of a stink with Amazon to censure me, just like they did many of their previous critics. Like Rand, it seems, the Objectivist notion of freedom applies only to the few they select."
1,A Brutal Read,"I had heard so much about this book that I had to read it to see what all of the fuss was about. First I read Fountainhead and found it interesting, even though it was a bit heavy-handed. I think Fountainhead was a much better book; probably because I could see some depth in the characters and it was the first time I had been exposed to Rand's point of view. Sadly, Rand covers a lot of the same ground with Atlas and the characters in Atlas are one-dimensional. The reader gets to choose from strong,smart, manly heroes (Dagny included) and the smarmy, wimpy, whining losers that make up all of the characters with few exceptions. I understood early on that Government was bad, the Creators were good, and the rest of the people were pawns, but Rand goes over and over and over the same territory. Did I mention that she goes over the same territory again and again?"
2,Font size makes practically unreadable,"Shrugged is a big book and should not reduced to a paperback of this size. It is ~ 2"" thick with ~ a #6 font size. I have 20/20 vision and even with reading glasses it was virtually unreadable. Bought a Kindle Edition and highly recommend the novel as a ""must read!"". Shades of what's going on in the USA and the world today. If you are a touchy feely liberal, don't buy it. You'll burn it after the first couple hundred pages."
3,little respect for the reader,"If you are going to read an Ayn Rand novel, read the Fountainhead. The Fountainhead has the same content without the repetitious disdain for the reader.Nonetheless, I think everybody should read this book twice. Read it as a teenager to get the hormonal rush that only Objectivism's tunnel-vision can give you. Then read it after you've lived a little in the ""Real World"" to see how easy it is to use Objectivism to enslave your fellow man while spouting Rand-ese word for word."
3,Definitely not a nod for tolerance...,"I'm glad I read this as an adult. Makes for great discussion. But I don't see Life being so black and white, nor people such one-dimensional caricatures. Sorry to simplify, but I could never go toe-to-toe with the philosophers and intellects -so I'll just give my impression."
1,As our need for alternative energy sources...,"becomes increasingly desperate, let us not forget the books of Ayn Rand. Especially where home heating fuel is in short supply."
1,"Not philosophy, merely badly written hogwash","If anyone thinks this overripe, silly sack of fiction represents some sort of sane, rational philosophical system, then you have not read and do not understand philosophy. As philosophy, it is childish and cruel. As a work of fiction, it is bloated and dull. I cannot believe that any educated individual would consider this book as a basis for a system of living (in fact, I find it hard to believe (and sad) that there are people out there you use ANY work of fiction as a basis for a system of living -- the bible included)."
1,Stupid Philosophy,I pleased by how quickly the book arrived. The philosophy of Ayn Rand however leaves alot to be desired. What a complete narcissist she was. What a pity she never learned that the only way to be truly happy and fulfilled is by giving your complete devotion and love to God. I also this that her talent as a writer is questionable too.
1,Drivel.,"I still cannot fathom why the pundits and tea baggers have latched onto this pile of refuse. Mundane, asinine, monotonous and surprisingly shallow. Much like the book's flocking (as in sheep) fans."
1,"Because of this piece of crap, I am never reading again!","At first I was happy to be learning how to read. It seemed exciting and magical, but then I read this: Atlas Shrugged, by Ayn Rand. I read every last word of this garbage, and because of this piece of crap, I am never reading again!"
1,Price,"The movie sparked interest in the book. the price set by the publisher quickley washed it away. I will not pay more for an ebook then I would the physical book. So, I won't purchase either one! 9.99 folks, get with it or miss out."
5,Atlas Shrugged (used),"No need to review the book itself other than to say if one hasn't ever read it, one should. I had read the book years ago and had mostly forgotten what a powerfully told story it was. One that is very applicable to modern times.What I wish to do here is pass along my thanks to the dealer. The book came to me quickly and in better shape than I actually expected it to be in. It has lots of life left in it and will be passed along to family and friends.Thanks."
5,An read for the mind and spirit!!,"An amazing story written decades ago that speaks about our time with astounding clarity. The story is great and it sucks you in, but the book offers more than a great story, it also shares insight into humanity and how to push to a great state of living. A must read!!"
4,Compelling Capitalist...Propaganda?,"A good friend made me read this and I'm glad I did. Think of it as hard-hitting capitalist (or better put, anti-socialist) propaganda spun into a compelling Hollywood plot. Long on twists as well as pages. This book is a must for libertarians and undecided liberals...as well as students of 20th century American history. You may be tired of Ayn Rand when you finish, but you won't be sorry you read it."
4,Good indeed but a little bit long,"I've just finished reading this book and it is very good, all these things about the real meaning of being human and live it is remarkable. I'm still feel motivated by the words of the radio speech(although it is very long)and I really hope there are a lot of John Galt outhere. If not, everybody should read this book to encourage them all to start living."
3,Atlas Shrugged,"The book Atlas Shrugged is a book that needs some revision. There are parts in the story that just drag on for a number of pages. The reader loses interests during these parts. Luckily there are some parts that make up for the excessive usage of words, for instance all the love triangles and conflicts between characters. There are not too many twists and turns causing action in the story but when there is, it is unexpected and hardly predictable regaining the attention of the reader. Overall the story line is very well thought out and interesting, that is why the book Atlas Shrugged is worth three stars."
4,kindle version is a disaster,"reading the kindle version is infuriating. so many typos, misplaced punctuation, etc. ""John Galt"" is mispelled as ""John Gait"" at LEAST 15 times, which is an annoying distraction that pulls you out of the exposition and awkwardly reminds you that you are reading sloppily translated digital version of this classic."
2,Atlas Shrugged? I don't blame him,"A very tedious read (1200+ pages). I can tell that Mrs. Rand is Russian. She may be a great writer but, my god, would these characters pleeeeze GET TO THE POINT(!) in a hundred words or less. No wonder her America was dying. Who wants to listen to all this drivel. People, even in the fifties, didn't express themselves as her dialogue (?). To be fair: Yes, there are moochers and looters. Yes, we punish success. Yes, jealousy is a huge motivator in many. But say it in fewer words and clearer sentences. Work on a realistic solution. Maybe this story would work in Russia where they love to talk, but not in the good old USA. Ditto for The Fountainhead."
1,Why is this ebook not available in Australia?,Could somebody please explain why I can buy this book as a paperback at Amazon.com and import it to Australia but can't download it to my Kindle?
5,Who is John Galt?,"Very good quality book, larger print and easier to read than paperback. Its spooky how Ayn nailed the events we are witnessing on a daily basis so many years ago. When I first read Atlas Shrugged 45 years ago it was purely fiction of a far off 1984 scenario world; now we are living through it. Time to escape to Galt's Gulch."
5,Brilliant. Makes a great gift!,"A brilliant book. I could not put it down. Masterful on so many levels, I particularly enjoyed the depiction of parasitic intellectuals - the writers who can't write, the artists who can't draw, and composers who write noise instead of music. Given the political events of today it is especially relevant. It makes a great graduation, birthday or Christmas gift."
5,"Amazing. While I greatly disagree with her, her argument is entirely worth exploring.","Ayn Rand argues against socialism at every level, and glorifies ego. Regardless of if you disagree or agree, it's worth the read. It is a very heavy book. it's a challenge, but it's also rewarding. The weeks of reading this novel helped me to change, mature, and to develop my philosophy on government, economics, relationships, and life."
3,"Great Book, Flimsy Edition","I purchased this book for my husband's birthday and was very disappointed to find that it arrived damaged. I returned it to Amazon and requested a replacement, which also arrived damaged. I've never had a problem with dented or torn books from Amazon before, so I'm thinking that this edition was made with materials too flimsy for its massive size. I ended up returning it outright and plan to buy a hardcover edition instead."
5,Best Fiction Read,"This book is one that you will not want to put down. After nearly forty years of marriage my wife and I have finally something to fight about, who get's to read the book and when.It's super reading and if you think about it when reading you may see some of the same conditions today.Can't recommend highly enough. It's a must read."
3,Kindle version needs work,"Atlas shrugged is a fantastic book. This Kindle version of it has a lot of typos, presumably due to the scanning and OCR process. It becomes really annoying towards the end of the 1st third of the book. Also Text to Speech is disabled which I think makes the publishers look pathetic. It's a pity because this is a particularly long book and it would be nice to have parts of it read to you."
2,Jeez... Did I read a different book than everyone else?,"The philosophy is right on, and I do not understand those people that call Rand a Nazi or just plain sick. My problem was with the story. I never have cared so little about what happened the chacacters. This could have been a great 200 page book if Rand had quit repeating her ideas over and over (Noone can deny she does this). Visualize someone making a dollar sign in the air. If you can take this person seriously and not break out laughing, then this book is for you"
5,Should be mandatory reading in all schools!,"Want to know where American is heading? Read this classic! Miss Rand wrote a cautionary tale of what happens when class envy is encouraged. When our ""Atlases"" shrug ... God help us!"
5,THE PAST IS PRESENT,"I have read this before; the first time being in 1964. Now, the book evinces a prescience I would have never have even considered. A movement to the ideology of the""lowest common denominator"" is well on its way in 2012. ""Who is John Galt?"""
5,very interesting,"One of my old bosses handed my his copy and said, this book was written in the 50s, read closely on how similiar things are today. I was shocked on how right he was. The book is a great read. Please don't base it off the movie that flopped recently."
3,Weightier than expected...,"Undoubtedly authentic version of book as written...Got arm weary holding this thousand page document, reading in bed. Maybe E Version better for my particular needs...TJ"
2,not pleased,"the book has about 30 pages chopped off about 2 inches from the top. im not sure how to go about returning, so i guess i'll deal with it"
3,"Interesting philosophy, if you can bear the boring plot","Well, this nice over-1000-page book gives a nice intro to Rand's philosophy of objectivism. There were times were I just wanted to put the book down, throw it across the room and never pick it up again. But I was intrigued, I kept reading and it was a nice way to see how it went.I'm sure you've read the past reviews on what the plot is, so I won't retell what the plot is to you all, but the book just didn't get interesting until the last third of the book. There are many parts that are dry, repetitive, and sometimes pointless; but they all help out in some way to capture what Rand is trying to say. I would recommend this book if one has time and really wants to know what Rand is trying to say. If not, go for the cliff notes. They may not be as extensive, but hey, I think learning the philosophy is the point of the book, not the plot."
5,Classic that everyone should read.,I though it was fantastic. It should make people think twice before they complain about our system of free enterprise. At times she was a bit long winded and seemed to go off on a rant for pages. All in all...Classic Read.
3,...a secular cult,I wonder whether 'Objectivists' are aware of the idolatrousnature of the Ayn Rand Cult...This novel is very interesting as an illustration of Miss Rand's ambiguous relationship with the Jewish religion and her misguided attempt to retain some of its elements on a clearly idolatrous basis. I highly recommend it to readers interested in the 'cult phenomenon'...
4,Atlas Shrugged,"Lengthy, but intertwines governmental forms, logic, philosophy, morality, history and logic.When you ask a customer to review a purchase, you should not have any minimum number of words!"
1,Interestingly written but too flawed to be embraced,Depending on your belief system this is one of many viewpoints: from an alternative lifestyle to a road to hell. She was a good writer but her Eastern European block upbringing warped her perceptions of life. I feel sorry for those who embrace this philosophy - it is as cold and hard as the East Berlin she escaped.
5,A must read for every American citizen.,I've read this book three times over the past forty years and the message is still strong. Socialism will be the death-knell of this country if it continues to run unchecked.
2,Dated,"I know that this book is revered by economists, political scientists and futurists, but I found it dated and odd and not at all informative. I heard Alan Greenspan was a student of Ayn Rand and even read drafts of the book as she wrote it. So this was a must read which I wish I had not. I especially have a problem with the length of the book as it seems many episodes are repetitive. At least the price is right."
1,An Evil Book Written By An Hypocrite,This is one of the vilest pieces of crap to masquerade as a novel written by a woman who strings words together and calls it writing.
1,Plainly bad.,"Let's skip the ""philosophy"" debate-- judged as a story, this book sucks. It is boring. The characters are silly. The story is uninteresting.I would give it less than one star if I could."
1,Prices... publishers... prices....,"It is beyond me why publishers decide to overprice eBooks. It makes digital music seem cheap! I love my Kindle, but when I want to buy a book, I expect (well I hope anyway) the eBook to be cheaper than the physical copy. When this happens, I will change my review, but for now, don't expect anything over 1 star if the eBook is more expensive."
5,a must read,The most enlightening book I have ever read. Couldn't put it down. It's 1168 pages but it took less than 2 weeks to read. I have a feeling I will read it many more times in my lifetime. There is a lot to learn here.
4,50 CDs of pleasure,"This is certainly an version worth buying to Atlas Shrugged fans and also to those who have been scared of the over 1400 pages of this magnificent novel. I have only one remark. Rather than using 50 CDs (!!!), why not thinking to alternative supports and formats, such as one pendrive filled of mp3s?"
4,"It's a long read, folks, but worth it.","I have a prediction: you will probably not agree with everyidea in this book. I have another prediction to go with it:you won't care. Even those who can't understand Objectivism will almost definitely find the book worth their while. _Atlas Shrugged_, ranked on national surveys as being second only to the Bible as the book listed as a primary influence, has shocked, frustrated, and liberated more readers than any book written in Rand's era. The dialogue is fantastic. The plot is a little hollow if you read it as a novel, but who reads it as a novel?"
1,Dreck,"Just a terrible read, I highly recommend to stay far away from this dreck. You can describe this book with two words.... ""hot garbage"""
2,Arrogant -- and Rand had no faith in her reader,"Rand's theory of how the most powerful among us should be give unlicensed power to run the world and be damned with the unfortunate among us is heartless and arrogant. In addition, I was offended by the little faith Rand has in us as readers. If we can read a book that's over 1,000 pages long, give us credit for understanding subtle metaphors; Rand has to spell everything out like we're mental midgets. I was in a bad mood the entire time I read this book."
3,"Heavy, heavy","I think it probably was a good read but it was so-o-o heavy that I just didn't enjoy it. When I read, it is for pleasure, not to ""study."" Consequently, I didn't really enjoy it. Should someone want to plow through it, I'm sure they will enjoy it, just not me!@"
2,"Not library binding, small print","This review is not a review of the novel, but a review of the product itself. This book is quite small, subsequently has small print, and is not library bound as it says. While the size is definitely listed in the particulars, I simply didn't realize it would be smaller than my hand. If you are expecting a good stitch binding, you will be disappointed, as this is apparently a paperback simply glued into a hard cover, which wouldn't last long if available for public use. Additionally, there appear to be some issues with the formatting, with varying margin widths and chapters that begin mid-page. Not having read this book yet, I don't know if that is part of the intended format or not. If none of these things are issues for you, then this book is probably fine. At any rate, I'm returning this one, and will be looking for a larger print version with proper binding."
3,Atlas Shrugged,"Ayn Rand's philosophy, Objectivism, is narrow-minded, and in my opinion very unrealistic. If Christians believe love is the greatest commandment then Objectivists believe selfishness and capitalism are the greatest commandments. The book has a strong anti-communist theme and a very strong capitalist theme. The story is basically Ayn Rand's view of the United States if it ever turned into a communist country. I enjoyed reading the book though it is a little far-fetched. The characters are nicely developed and the plot is enjoyable. Besides the one chapter of pure preaching the book moves along quickly. Along with all the anti-communist and capitalist themes Rand throws in her view of love and relationships. She sucessfully applies her objectivism philosophy to every aspect of life. If you are a slow reader this book is not for you. But other than that I would recommend this book to any one interested in learning about other ways to view life."
5,atlas shrugged is great,"Audio cd of book. The narration is first rate. I love the imagery that Rand has written into the story. The book/story is very thought provoking and timely, particularly given our current political situation and the demonization of capitalism and the ""producers"" in our country."
1,Needed a good editor,"Here's a summary of the book: Money good, hand-outs and government intervention bad.The author's look at capitalism is at first interesting, but it quickly gets old after she beats the same concept over your head in a very pompous manner. I finished the book only as a challenge to myself. This book could have been EASILY edited to half the number of pages and lose nothing.You might like the book if you find the next paragraph exciting...Money good, hand-outs and government intervention bad. Money good, hand-outs and government intervention bad. Money good, hand-outs and government intervention bad. Money good, hand-outs and government intervention bad. Money good, hand-outs and government intervention bad.We are told that the only ones who disagree with this are fools or a welfare-sponges."
2,Objective-tastic!,"Objectivism isn't philosophy folks. It's like, ""Philosophy for Dummies."" My first day of my Social Sciences class at college, I, having read AS, I piped up and said that Smith's ""Wealth of Nations"" was similar in a few aspects to Atlas Shrugged and Ayn Rand's views on objectivism. They looked at me like I had just thrown up all over the floor. No one who has anything to do with academia takes crap like Atlas Shrugged seriously, and if you asked them to belt out a list of philosophers, Ayn Rand might make the top 1000. Anyway, Rand does an... alright job of synthesizing some broad ideas, but another thing that bothers me is that it's not very good writing. It's not awful... it's just mediocre, and trudging through over a thousand pages took it out of me something fierce, like having to read 3 da vinci codes, only, you know, less action-packed.Anyway, don't delude yourselves into thinking Ayn Rand is a philosopher, because she's not. She's an AUTHOR."
3,A Manifesto for Conspiracy Thinkers,"For people who hate to read, just skip the first 200 pages. They are boring. After the first 200, you will be able to read how a subversive plot to take over the world will begin and how it will be accomplished. Under the guise of being a novel, Ms. Rand had to have insider knowledge about this subject. Of course, 1000 pages is a bit arrogant, but so are the individuals who are acting under the guise of good but are truly evil!Brings to mind, the Bohemian Grove in California. If you dont know what this is, you need to look it up on the net. Be educated, there's still time."
3,Atlas Shrugged,I love the book but the print is so small that it is almost impossible to read. I would rather pay more and have a little larger print.
2,Gotta read it to believe it,"Well, If you really like novels that are long, complicated, far fetched, unrealistic, with a bad ending your going to love this novel. I believe Ayn exaggerated a little to much throughout the book. If she made it a little more believable I think I would of liked it. She also need to create some more likeable characters. They all came across mean and selfish, I know that was Ayn's point but that doesn't make a good book.I do think it was interesting to read just because of the different approach she took in the novel. Ive never read such a thick book before and it was very rewarding and although I felt the ending needed some work, the book did keep my interest until the end. So you decide whither you want to read it or not."
1,Wasn't a fan,"I found it to be somewhat of a diatribe preaching to type A workaholics. Yes, corruption, old boys clubs and complacency are bad, but in a day and age where everything is GO GO GO I found it hard to connect to a book about how we should be working more and harder."
1,Very small print.,The book itself is very good. I would recommend Atlas Shrugged to anyone. But the print in this particular edition is very small and strains my eyes. Get another edition with larger print for comfort in reading this very good book and very long book!
2,A Noble attempt by a Confused and Frustrated Author,"Ayn Rand lived a tough life, there's no doubt about that. She suffered through the Russian Revolution and somehow survived in America and managed to make a semi-successful career as a writer. All of that aside, her writing reaches average at best. Her dialogue and character descriptions are so out-right and blatant and the philosophy she bases around reason and creative thought contradicts itself with her dogmatic forcefulness. She herself scolded any of her followers for questioning her. This book has a place and a time, appropriate for teenagers finding their way through adolescence. Otherwise, it is a drawn-out work of average merit."
1,Over-rated Right Wing Pablum,"This book is only good if you buy in to right-wing BS. For the rest of us, it is insufferable, long, and boring."
5,Ayn Rand,"Ayn Rand is unknown here in Brazil - I believe she doesn't even have any translated title yet. Fortunately a friend made a sugestion, and now I'm enjoying this book a lot."
5,Best book ever...,Unfortunately events in the book appear to be happening in our current time. Shocking how accurate and specific the details in her warning actually were- especially given how long ago she wrote them.
3,500 pages of ideas and action jam packed into 1188 pages.,"This book is at least twice as long as it should be. The ideas, though interesting, are presented in the least interesting manner I could possibly think of: by being repeated over and over and over and over and over. At one point you just want to scream at the book ""WHO *IS* JOHN GALT?!"" because you've wasted the past three hundred pages reading about the sex lives of industrial magnates and the state of the copper industry due to piracy.The characters that you don't hate, that is to say, all of the capitalists, just move so slowly that it hurts. If you want the ideas written about in the book, read one of the many, many commentaries about the book. If you want to read a bland novel with (admittedly many) flashes of brilliance, go head, but you've been warned."
5,"The most disappointing part, is it all came true","The most disappointing part of this novel is, after having been forewarned, how close to the truth it has all become. Unfortunately, there is no secret village nestled in the Colorado mountains to which any Producer can escape the Takers... Ayn Rand gave us all the fair warning we deserved, and we squandered it by electing the very protagonist she envisioned. ""You are enslaved to the degree you are dependent on Government."" However, all is not lost, John Galt still lives, within The TEA Party."
5,Took My Breath Away and Swept Me Off My Feet; rating = 10,"I first read this book 5 years ago-I've read it again twice (as well as The Fountainhead, Anthem and various Rand non-fiction) and each time I read it I know I am not mistaken in saying that Ayn Rand was a true genius. This book changed my life; it says everything I always felt and wanted to say but could never find the words to express. This book has it all: philosophy, politics, history, science, economics, ethics, psychology, passion and romance! However, not for the faint hearted (over 1,000 pages long), but if you've got the curiosity to find out who is John Galt and the intellectual capacity to understand what John Galt means to all of us you'll have no trouble finishing this novel. Passion + Intellect make this book POWERFUL in its message and an outstanding achievement!! It took my breath away-WOW!"
5,Atlas Shrugged Brings the truth into focus.,"The simplicity of the characters and plot is a stroke of genius. Through the polarization of her characters, she brings into focus the simple truths and absurdities around us."
1,Awful,This was the worst book I ever read. I found the one star reviews more thought provoking than the book itself.
4,I liked it.,"I heard several people talk about this book but never really thought it would be all that interesting. With the dust settling from the 2004 election and my interest in logic, I picked up a copy and read the first few pages. It grabbed my attention from the start and kept me plowing through until the end. Finishing the book was not the easiest of tasks but a good accomplishment. It definitely changed my outlook on some things and provided me with a better understanding of philosophy and conservative thought. I recommend this book to anyone with an open mind and thirst for knowledge. Try it out."
5,"Amazing, Life-Changing Book","There are no words I could write in this review that would do justice to Atlas Shrugged. There's nothing I could say to express how life-changing this novel was for me. If you're willing to give it a chance then please do so. You owe it to yourself. The book was written in 1957 but in many ways talks about the very same issues we're seeing today. If you're not willing to commit to the price (though this book would be a steal at any price) then go to your local library instead. This is the first book that made me excited for my daughters to learn how to read. I have yet to see any logical complaints about the ideas expressed in this work. Read it, understand it."
3,good book but way too long,"This is a great book that I feel all entrepreneurs and business owners will love, but it's way too long. The same message is said again and again (in a few different ways) and the descriptions of the characters are way too long. I feel she could have gotten to the point a little better and cut this thing by 50%.I enjoyed this book. It certainly presents a good argument for the importance of those who own businesses and employ people. Some will use it as an argument for less government control, which may have been Ayn Rand's point, and probably was to some extent, but to understand this, I feel you should look at her and how she grew up.Lots of people have read this book, which I think is a good reason to read it yourself. You'll understand ""Who is John Galt?"" and also what they are talking about, if nothing else. There are also some great lessons within it though, you just have to cut through a lot of unnecessary words. :)"
4,3 CDs NOT 40 CD boxset,"I received only 3 Atlas Shrugged audio cds in my order. I was initially worried that I had not received the complete unabridged audio book because many of the reviews on this item say that other buyers received a 40 CD set. After having been assured by the seller that I purchased the complete audio book, I'm fine with only having the 3 CDs, which are easier to carry around than 40! I've jumped around listening to the tracks, and it seems to be the complete book, which I assume is unabridged. There are 40 or so ""chapters"" and each are about an hour long.However, the CDs were delivered in 2 flimsy plastic CD cases, with no colorful box and I couldn't help feeling slightly ripped off for an item that costs about $300. The item is a gift for someone who thought it was very important to have the unabridged version."
3,Excellent but not his best.,"I bought Tell Me How Long The Train's Been Gone still swooning over Baldwin's Another Country. To my disappointment, this book did not have the same complexity, depth, nor energy that Another Country had. I found myself sticking to the book in some hopes that I would reach the same feeling of satisfaction and rapture that I found with Another Country, or Giovanni's Room. Not a complete waste of time, but not Baldwin's best."
5,Bon Book!,"This is an amazing find. It has everything a rookie or a veteran to cruising will ever need. I found it very helpful in planning my sixth cruise. But, I have also passed it on to first time cruisers who couldn't be more thankful. Detailed descriptions on all types of cruise ships, ports of call, shore excursions. And helpful hints on how to save $$ on booking, why to use a travel agent and what to pack. I wish I could find a book that was similiar, I've read this one too many times..."
3,A mystery tale gone wild,"Since this book is labeled as mainstream, it was quite a surprise to realize that Kate Atkinson plays with reality and time much the same way as the sci-fi legend Philip K. Dick. This can be most clearly seen in the later half of the book, which consists solely of several dreamlike episodes... and in the end the reader can't be certain, what really happened.But. Then, just when you think Atkinson really made it, she spoils everything by explaining very sensibly and accurately all about the later events in the characters' lives. This destroys the magic and makes me think that mainstream writers shouldn't play with topics as difficult as these. Why did Atkinson feel she had to put her story back to the earth? A big mistake, I say. Without the last pages this would've been a great novel. Now I can't give more than 3 stars."
1,Didn't even finish the book,"Although I normally enjoy Kate Atkinson's books, I didn't like this one. It goes back and forth between dreams and reality and it is hard to tell which is which. I didn't even finish reading the book, although, I must admit, I did read the last chapter."
2,"Patchy writing, scattered story","I wouldn't recommend this book. Although I like the author's language and writing in general, this book did not live up to its promise. The story plods along and then skips suddenly somewhere else, and somewhere else again. I liked Emotionally Weird very much, though, and look forward to her other books."
2,"interesting, but very scattered","although i enjoyed this book, i found the mix of past and present was a bit confusing, and i never really knew what was going on during the last half. the ending was too vague and i did not come away satisfied. all in all, it was an interesting book, but not a phenomenal one."
2,ends in obscurity,I was sorely disappointed with this book after reading all the rave reviews. This magically written and initially captivating story about a young girl and her eccentric family turns into a jumbled mess of confused ramblings in the last third of the book. The book seemed to stop in midsentence with an affected summary attached on for explanation. I had absolutely no clue what was going on and what's more I do not think the author did either.
2,Human Croquet,"I found this book extremely difficult to read because of the constant time shifts. I expected complex plots from Kate Atkinson but usually it all makes sense in the end and one can appreciate the journey. However, in this book, parts of the story remain unclear at the end. None of the characters really seem to matter. Moreover, it is never entertaining enough to warrant the time spent trying to work it all out."
3,Not a favorite,"I really liked ""Case Histories"" and was quite excited about starting this one. I am not the type of reader that only likes linear, neat storylines. Far from it. In fact, I like the challenge of a non-traditional novel, but this one didn't work for me. I liked parts of it quite a bit. Atkinson's sense of humor is really funny. Some of the dream sequences were interesting and well-developed. But, as a whole, the book just didn't work for me. I felt like it's unfinished and in real need of some editing, particularly all the run-ons and comma splices. As an English teacher, these really annoyed me, and made me want to bring out my grading pen! But, it's really the shifting narrators that bothered me. I don't think the story came together in any logical way. So, I can't say I recommend this one."
4,could not put it down,"I really enjoyed reading this book. I enjoyed the journey that the story took me on. I never saw some the twists in the plot coming. This is a book that I wouldn't normally read, but after reading some of the other reviews I decided to try it. I am glad that I did. It was time well spent!"
5,"A daring writer who takes chances, delving into the human psyche and heart with an inspiring pen!",Kate Atkinson is one of my all time favorite writers. Her work is daring and inspires me to write more imaginatively myself.
4,Brace Yourself!,"As Tartan Noir goes, this is awfully good, and also awfully Noir.The pleasure with Kate Atkinson is characters that leap off the page. Notonly do you know them, you want to know them, and keep knowing them longafter the story ends, even though they have enough dramas going on in theirlives for a few dozen Coronation Streets.The setting - Edinburgh, the lowlands of Scotland, sometimes northern England,is equally vivid, foggy, gloomy and sometimes menacing (does the sun NEVER comeout over there?)Kate Atkinson is a terrific writer, smart and sometimes wickedly funny but...warning: You don't read her stuff when you want cheering up."
1,Ewwww YUCK!!,"I had to sign online just to find out who sings the DREADFUL remake of Talk Talk's ""It's My Life"". I love Talk Talk's song and when I heard a remake of it on the radio I couldn't figure out how in the world this girl or woman or whoever was ever allowed in a recording studio let alone record this song. I thought ""she sings worse than Brittany Spears (if that's even possible) but it is come to find out. Except for me of course! Haha!Yuck!! Now I know who NEVER to buy an album by.I tried to give it a 1/2 or 1/4 star but I guess a whole one is the least one available.Give me Celine, Christina Ag., or Jaci Velasquez anyday!"
3,Great Cover And Fun Live Tracks.,"It is no surprise that for their first Singles collection No Doubt would choose to cover an 80's band. The Talk Talk's tune ""It's My Life"" gets the sunnier, glossier treatment in this new New Wave cover. After choosing between this and Depeche Mode, INXS songs, the band made a good choice and settled with this one which shows the band's capacity for technical excellence and melodic emotion. Gwen Stefani's voice shines as well as the over-all production which has a breezy quality. Equally enjoyable for the more hardcore fans are the included 3 live tracks. ""Sunday Morning"" jumps and dances around while ""Rock Steady"" is a dreamy, reggae-tinged performance and wonderful slide guitar by Tom Dumont. ""Bathwater"" is a fun, exciting take on 20's cabaret and feels more enticing live than on record (as cabaret should). For fans who already have all the only albums here they get the new song plus some good live treats."
2,"No doubt, the re-make quenches","I first heard the song on the radio en route to work. I enjoyed it immensely and wanted to know who did the remake. No Doubt's redo of the 80's hit brought back good memories of the new wave era. But, of course, it does not compare to the original Talk Talk version."
1,80's still rule,"Proof a hot chick with a decent voice can destroy a synth-pop hit from a better era of music. Though it's really the sound of the music that is lacking in Gwen's version, so I can't blame her for the disaster. The original still rules."
4,Excellent Story--Better than the TV Series,"Note: This is more of a comparison to the TV Series than an actual review. It's mainly meant for those wondering if the Air movie is worth a purchase after having seen the series. Spoiler-free.I liked the story of the Air movie a LOT more than the series. All the plot elements that I thought were silly and/or convoluted in the TV series were removed in the movie. Everything was explained clearly, and the story just made more sense. To me, it was a lot more believable and much more touching. I'm glad I didn't just dismiss it just because I wasn't crazy about the series.If you enjoyed the series, however, I see no reason why you wouldn't also enjoy the movie. It's a completely new story, but the characters' personalities are left more or less in tact."
3,"Not Great, but not Bad Either","The movie felt pretty different from the series. I guess I had great expectations going in because a friend of mine compared it to such terrifically emotional animes such as Clannad, Kanon, and Rumbling Hearts. There was plenty of drama in this film, but for some reason I just felt like some of it was forced. I did get through it and it did offer some memorable moments. Just not nearly as many as some of the other names animes."
2,Not as good as the counterpart,"While I certainly enjoyed Air TV, the movie for me left something to be desired. It seemed that the art style was changed, in a way I personally did not like. Also I noticed that they used stills and drawings in the movie, which left me feeling sort of cheated, as if the movie wasn't worth the cost. Since I own the series, I will probably sell this movie. For me it didn't add anything new other then annoyance. I felt much less connected with the characters, etc, which while it does make sense it still does nothing to justify my buying it. While I understand that many have an opinion different from mine, that is how I feel. If you own the series, you certainly don't need to add this to your collection as it adds nothing new. And if you haven't seen the series, buy it first. S.A.V.E packs are really cheap, and it's only $5 more for a much better product."
1,C-film with a D-cast and E-script,"This was a really bad film. Four guys with a combined IQ of a cucumber comes up with the idea to have sex with older women. The Script and the acting was so bad that you thought it was a porn movie except there was no porn either. Could possible be used in a class room for future directors under the headline ""Past mistakes that we can learn from"". Still, I am certain that it will appeal to some viewers but I don't know why."
5,Like The Title Says...It's About MILF's,Amy Lindsay Shines as the main star in this one. Great body. Very nice. Lots of nudity. Why else would one buy this??? Surely no one is expecting an Oscar winning movie.
3,MILF IS OKAY IF,MILF IS OKAY IF YOU DO NOT HAVE ANYTHING BETTER TO DO AND JUST NEED SOMETHING DUMB TO MAKE YOU LAUGH -
3,Skin flik,"The story line is pretty weak, 4 college kids hooking up with older woman like it's easy. However there are plenty of sexy milfs in it. I recommend renting this one."
1,Fraud,"First clue the women pictured on the DVD cover are HOT and not in the movie. The movie is about four college friends, two of whom have a bet to see who can bag the most milfs. Three of these friends would have trouble getting to second base with a blowup doll. In the beginning they get shot down by everyone, yet somehow find women drunk enough to have sex with them. There is one good looking woman in the film. She is not a milf she is a student. Don't get excited. You are led to believe you are seeing her exposed breast after someone bumps into her at a party and her breast slips out of her halter. They actually used a boob double. The mystery boob is only shown in a closeup. I gave this a one star rating because I don't think they allow a zero star rating. The only redeming quality would be if you have never seen a woman's naked breast before you will in this movie. I already tossed my copy. Beware."
2,Not sure if the item is authentic,"I received this item fast,so the shipping works well!But I'm not sure if this item is authentic.The real kabbalah red string should be made of wool,and this item didn't seem like one."
1,this string is a fake,This string come from Arkansas it is not a holy string from isreal bought from someone less fourtonate than many people. Its a shame people fall for these hoaxes .
5,Great Masterpiece of Art Rock and New Wave,Well This is the sea... a great cd of Art and Rock 'n' Roll. Mike Scott and Co. created a jewel
5,Essential for anyone interested in crystal skulls.,"This is the best book I've read on the subject,It's a brilliant and fascinating read.The first part gives details of the authors (and others who work with skulls)experiences with crystal skulls;how they come into your life,traveling with them,healing with them and how they communicate with you.Part two gives great advice on how to choose (or be chosen by) the right skull for you,along with how to cleanse and care for your new friend.Part three gives exercises for self-healing and protection,meditation and dreamwork to try with your skull.Also includes exercises to heal and protect others with a skulls aid.A must read."
5,At Last! Help for Searching Single Women.,"This book is a must for any woman over thirty who has not yet found her man. It's wise, funny, informative and written in a clear and comprehensive way.Not only does it tell you the in's and out's of dating and wedding a divorced man, it gives vital information to help you meet the many challanges along the way.I laughed, I cried, I loved it. I'm giving it to all my friends who still haven't been able to close the deal, or are completely sure they want to."
4,Not bad,"I've already married my divorced man and I wish I had read this before I took the plunge. I can't stress ENOUGH that marrying a divorced man with children, a crazy ex wife and alimony payments is a big freaking deal and that a woman needs to be smart and prepared. That said, this book will help prepapre you for some of the seemingly unbelievable scenarios you will face. I recommend it as a starting point for a woman in the early blissful days of a relationship. You'll need the perspective before you let yourself be taken away by the "" love will help us through this!"" stage. This book is an easy breesy but eyeopening read. Even now after being married and in the thick of things, I find it helpful!"
1,Patronizing,"I bought this book hoping for the best, but could not honestly respect an author who talked about the need to ""deprogram"" her significant other and presented her material in such a ""Cosmo Girl"" way. Perhaps the second half of the book redeemed the work, but I personally couldn't finish it."
4,a little bit too encouraging,"I am a single unmarried mom considering a divorced man that I dated a few times. I started learning more by reading many about divorced men. This book certainly explained some struggles of the divorced men and helped you be more understanding to him but it is a bit too encouraging the woman to put effort in some part of the books...this part is making me uneasy because I believe that men, divorced or not, want to please woman and feel that it's him who wins the woman, not the woman wins him. The biggest turn off or pressure to them is that the woman is doing more than he does.This book is also written for those single women with no children. This book will be more helpful if it tells single women to take things very slowly and be very patient WITHOUT trying too hard.(the book has some mixed messages so perhaps the author did tell this I m not sure...hah hah.)"
5,Brilliant!,Having read a dozen of books on how to deal with divorced men - this is the most practical and helpful of all. It deals with the issues in a lighthearted way and made me laugh. Highly recommended!
2,Try again...,"Anyone who has experience with HTML, XML, JScript, or VBScript, should avoid this book. The first half is introductions to the above languages with very little or no ASP. Most examples are suitable and others a poorly done and leave too much to the imagination.The slow pace seems to assume the authors expect the reader to have no programming or webpage development background at all, however some of the examples seem so vague in places it would be difficult for a beginner to piece it all together.I don't recommend this book to anyone who is learning ASP or any other mentioned language. While the book does baby step the reader towards more complicated work, I believe it doesn't cover the fundamentals it mentions fully. I suggest reading books on HTML, then CSS, and then ASP. With those three, anyone would be able to make a spiffy looking website with tons of features."
4,Pretty good....except for the typos,"The book on a whole was very informative. I learned quite a bit about ASP from reading it. The authors spend a lot of time towards the beginning of the book on XML and I'm not really sure what the connection between the two are. It almost seems like they should've written a separate book on XML rather than including it with this one. Also, I found quite a few typos throughout the book in the text and some of the code examples. Luckily I'm familiar enough with html that I was able to catch them, but for a beginner the errors could be really confusing."
4,Teach yourself Active Server Pages 3.0,I think it is a good beginner book that walk you easily from HTML to ASP.

4,Heavy Duty Indeed!,"This Waxman 7295 Self-Stick Round Felt Pads, Brown, 3/8-Inch is a great product for Cabinets that slam when you close them. Thar being said, it was this reason that I purchased the pad. Here is a brief overview of the features:Pros: Durability, exceptional quality, ability to ""hush"" the sound of slamming cabinetsCons: Wish they were a little softer (can't be characterized as ""cushions"")"
4,Good for COC/Sabbath fans who dont fly a confederate flag,"These guys are certainly competent metalicians. Proabably the fastest shortcut to describing these guys is that if you love Sabbath, you'll probably like this too. Unfortunately the singer is little too much into ozzy territory on his melodies on some songs. This guy has a little deeper voice, but its still very noticeable - especially because most bands have ripped on the scales that iomi plays on more than ozzy's vocal style - because ozzy's vocal style is so unique and obvious when its emulated.Anyway this is a very subtle progression from the days of Sabbath. Nothing shockingly new here. Good riffs. Good disc."
4,happy doomsentine's day,"a solid effort from the austin, tx quartet. pick this up and add a little doom to your day."
2,Good band but................,"I heard snippets of this album and thought it sounded really good. Now that I own it my opinion has changed. I'm a big fan of this style of music, but I find this album kind of sterile and claustrophobic. I think if this band evolves and lets their tunes open up and breath a little they could be great. The band can play and are as tight as a drum but I have one question. Does this band even HAVE a bass player? IMO if you're going to concentrate on heavy riff rock like this you need a bass player who can really groove behind all that riffage. The bass player is just locked in too tight with the rest of the band and is playing the same riffs as the guitars. Which IMO makes it kind of uninteresting. Also, they need to find a stronger vocalist. Period. The weak vocals totally take away from the heaviness. I would suggest go with an Orange Goblin record and bypass this. But I'm defnitely going to keep them in my radar."
4,Good music; Hard to listen to once you see what the band looks like.,"Very easy to get into. The riffs flow and instrumentals are great. Personally, I can't handle the fact the band looks like the staff at my local starbucks.... or any starbucks for that matter. Does it take away from the enjoyment of the music? Yup. Are my opinions superficial? Yes."
5,Killer!,This album is Rad! This album amps me up every time I listen to it. The guitar riffs are heavy and the overall sound is raw! Reminds me of Sabbath meets Master of Puppets meets old Slayer meets more Sabbath.
5,#1 Album of 2006!,"This is the best album of 2006! Period. From start to finish this cd rocks.I recommend this cd to anyone and everyone, especially if you liked Wolfmother,or just awsome metal! Go buy this cd!"
4,These guys rock!,"These guys simply kick serious! Buy it! Enjoy it! Rock on! This has to be simply the best true hard rock record to come out in many many years. Assuming their follow up is even better, a 5 out of 5 is on the way."
3,need a new singer!,"Evidently all the reviewers who have listened to this have no ear for vocal tone. The music is awesome,but the singing just plain sucks. Only reason I couldnt give this 5 stars."
1,One of the worst albums ever!,"The guitars are ok but are too loud and drown out the vocals. The drums are even louder which drown out the base. Add to that the vocals are terrible anyway so I have no idea why others are into this CD. Also, the whole package just sounds muddy, the production apparently wasn't top quality. If you like a raw garage band sound with amateur talent then get this. If you enjoy professional quality music stay away."
4,Sabbath left something behind when they played Texas in '71!,"I love all kinds of music, but I just ""dabble"" in metal. However, this may be the most fun I have had listening to a new ""heavy"" album since ""Appetite for Destruction"" came out in '87. Yes, it is over the top, bombastic, and melodramatic, but isn't that what metal is about?The Sword sound like Ozzy & Iommi hooked up with some southern girls back in the early 70s and left behind a hybrid sludge-metal / southern-rock sleeper cell waiting for their signal to emerge. Their sound is nothing new or unique, and really doesn't add anything to the overall rock story. However, ""Age of Winters"" still manages to sound fresh and exciting.Play ""Age of Winters"" back to back with Wolfmother's debut album and be thoroughly transported back to the dawn of heavy metal."
5,"WE NEED MORE ""AMBITION""","YES IT HAS COME TO THIS! MADONNA MANIA HAS SPAWNED A COVER VERSION EXPLOSION,AND ITS ABOUT TIME.THE MAIN PLAYERS IN MADDIE COVERS ARE ""WHO'S THAT GIRL"" AND ""BLONDE AMBITION"" AND I MUST ADMIT ""LIVE TO TELL"" TO ME IS A CLASSIC,FAR BETTER THAN AMBITION'S TRY AT COVERING ""CRAZY FOR YOU"".TO TAKE A SLOW BALLAD LIKE ""LIVE TO TELL"" AND TURN IT INTO A JUMPING DANCEFLOOR FILLING TRACK MUST HAVE BEEN NO MEAN FEAT BUT THEY DID IT,EVEN THE VOCALS BY TONY CARNEGIE SOUND CLOSE TO THE MADDIE ORIGINAL.SO IN CLOSING I WOULD URGE YOU TO BUY THIS,PUT IT ON YOUR STEREO AND REMEMBER THE EIGHTIES IN TRUE NINTIES STLE. P.S. IF ANYONE HEARS OF ANY DANCE COVERS OF ""MATERIAL GIRL"" OR ""TRUE BLUE"" LET ME KNOW."
2,By its cover,"I have not read this book. Indeed, how could I? The title and cover illustration are extremely offputting."
2,I think this item is not a legal CD and instead is a copy.,I am not 100% sure but I am thinking this CD I received is a copy. I like HG though.
5,Great pants,"I love the slim fit and it is nice to have a thigh pocket without the cargo pocket bulk. The fabric is more substantial than many other hiking pants, but they seem very durable. I liked them so much I bought another pair in khaki."
1,Slow and Boring,"This book seems to have a much better reputation than it deserves. It is slow and tedious. It puts far to much emphasis on politeness and superficial exchanges. After finsihing book one you still won't be able to say anything useful. Good if you want to impress a Japanese business associate, lousey if you actually need to survive in Japan.There are much better books available such as ""Shin Nihongo no Kiso"" and ""Minna na Nihongo"". If you do buy it make sure you get the kana version."
3,Poverty.,"This book has a number of short stories and after reading 2 or 3 of them, I noticed a definite thread going through about all of them. Extreme poverty, cold wet weather and threadbare flimsy clothing. Then redemption of the culprit and/or finding the person/place that had been lost, in other words, more or less a happy ending. It was worth what I paid for it."
4,A mechanic on the bookshelf,Need information about your Dodge truck? This book has it. From how much oil does the engine hold to wiring diagrams to help solve tough electrical problems.This book will help keep your Ram on the road.
5,Big help for beginners,"This manual has everything you need to know to do most of the maitenence on your truck. Very impressed with how compregensive this manual is. I have a 1995 Dodge Ram 2500 Cummins Turbo Diesel has just 100,000 miles on it and in terrific shape. I wanted something that could help me perform general maitenence procedures so I could ""baby"" my truck and get to know it inside and out without having to pay big $$. A vehicle this old tends to have smaller things here and there that need a little attention, and I would rather do this than have a $500-600 monthly payment when this truck is the most dependable vehicle I have ever owned."
4,"Dodge Full-Size pickups, 1994-2001",This was a manual I needed. The problem is it is lacking in some areas. Not much info on the cruise control for the Cummins engine. The info on some areas of the Diesel engine is sparse.
3,"Only good for a plus-sized woman, not the petite model in the photo","First off, these were shipped extremely fast.These came stretched over a large fake cardboard foot, which has stretched them out to virtual uselessness (not the sellers fault -- just the way they are made and packed), unless I can resurrect them in the dryer. These would be fine if you are a woman with a very large foot, or are a transgender. They will not, however, do much good for my wife, who wears a size 6 shoe. They are ridiculously large."
4,Excellent introduction to Biblical Hebrew,"Of the grammar books I have used in learning classical Hebrew, this was the most useful. The text is clear and complicated grammar is introduced both logically ad usefully. Adapted biblical passages are used as reading material after each chapter for most of the book. Don't worry about the reviewer's insistence that poetical language isn't covered - except for archaic poetry, the grammar is the same. One proviso, tho' - I didn't give the book 5 stars because it has no key. The University of Sheffield in the UK publish a key, H.G.M. Williamson's ""Annotated Key to Lambdin's Introduction to Biblical Hebrew"", ISBN 1 85075 065 3 (about $25). Together, they beat anything else."
4,"Very good book, transliterations should be separated","This is a good grammar and vocabulary and the passages chosen are a good start on the Scriptures. The weak point is that for those struggling with the Hebrew letters, it is NOT helpful to put the English transliteration in between the Hebrew words and the English translation: A future reprint of this book should set the type so that it is possible to cover up all the English tranliterations with a single piece of paper and practice the page. Also, a future printing should consider using the interlinear format for example translations: that way more advanced exercises can be demonstrated using the interlinears than the students could read on their own."
2,There are other better grammars than this one,"The best Hebrew grammar book for new learners is Andrew Bartelt's Fundamental Biblical Hebrew. Lambdin's book is definitely not it. In fact, I rate Weingreen's Classical Hebrew Grammar and Page Kelley's Classical Hebrew way over Lambdin's. Lambdin's text is confusing and frustrating. I say that as someone who started off by teaching myself Hebrew -- Weingreen was excellent, and Kelley supplemented where Weingreen fell short. I do have the Lambdin text, but gave it up in frustration. The one text that organizes and clarifies in a way that neither Lambdin, Weingreen, nor Kelley does, is Bartelt's. That's the text for the Hebrew neophyte, either with a teacher or a self-starter."
2,Where are all the Hebrew Characters?,"The explanations of hebrew grammar and sounds are much too difficult to understand in this ""introduction"". I spent more time trying to learn all of his transliterations and grammatical terms than I did actually learning the Hebrew. In fact, from the start in his sounds and spelling section he doesn't even give you the Hebrew characters! This might be all well and dandy if this was spanish or something but this is Biblical Hebrew, the main point is to be able to read and understand it instead of pronouncing it. I found that after a little study I could pronounce many things but I couldn't tell you how they looked on paper.<"
1,Frustrating introduction,"Lambdin provides an obtuse reference, not an introductory text. Having worked through an Elementary Hebrew class, I am now able to wade through most of the bewildering density of this book, but even so I remain frustrated by inconsistent paradigm charts (verb tenses are shown in their typical 3rd-1st person order while pronomial endings are shown 1st-3rd; the infamous irregular verb ""to be"" isn't even given in its entirety) and the intrusive use of transliterations, sometimes even to the exclusion of the actual Hebrew. This is a dry, self-satisfied description of the Hebrew language which fails to engage the learner, manages to confuse the beginner, and completely misses the immediacy and excitement of the Hebrew Bible... which is, I believe, the whole point of learning this language."
2,Length is too short,"Beware. This shirt is very short. It hits right at your waist. Not a good length if you're stretching. It also had a very strange smell at first, which goes away after washing. And the black is a little different shade from the Adidas shorts."
4,decent,"Comfortable, but shrinks after first wash. Maybe order a size larger as the shirt barely falls at the waist to begin with."
4,Ok for Light Smoking,"I bought the 402 with the Smokestop filter as I smoke about 3 cigars a week in my apt in the wintertime. This model is good enough for my purposes, but if you smoke more than that I'd suggest the 501 instead.As others have noted, the 402 is silent on settings 1 and 2 and produces about the same amount of noise as a tower PC fan on setting 3. Setting 4 is noisy so I switch to that setting just before I leave for work if I've smoked the night before. When I return at the end of the day there us usually little or no smoke smell.I'd estimate the Smokestop filter to contain about 3 pounds of activated charcoal. Much more than the thin layer found in most filters.The unit itself is very well constructed and for an air filter it looks stylish. Access to the inside for the occasional vacuuming and filter change is extremely easy (large hinged side door)."
5,Great Book!,"I listened to this in audio book format while I drove across country from NYC to LA. Excellent book... kept my interest, and presented a view of the Jack the Ripper myth I had never heard before. And, I think she is right.Excellent work for anyone who liked the movie ""From Hell"" or any other person interested in Jack the Ripper."
2,There are better books out there,"This book was an interesting read, but unfortunately does not by any means deserve to be the most widely read Ripper book. Her case is circumstantial at best. The problematic mtDNA evidence and links to numerous JtR letters that are undoubtedly frauds and the fact that Sickert may have been in France in September 1888 are all problems that would have to be dealt with much more seriously. I think it was a noble attempt, but her argument ultimately falls short. While it's not totally worthless, it is definitely not ""case closed"". One would be better served to read Begg's ""JtR The Facts"", or Sugden's ""Complete History"". For suspect oriented books, Fido or Evans & Gainey are much more worthwhile."
3,Reasonable doubt?,"I think the case was made that Walter Sickert wrote some, maybe all, of the ""Ripper Letters"", and that some of his paintings reflect the Ripper's handiwork. However, I think that a defense attorney could make a good argument that Sickert was just an ""aficionado"", a fan, a Rippermania groupie. Modern cases still attract such people, including those who ""confess"" to the crimes, as many of the Ripper letters did.I agree with most other reviewers that the book needed more editing. What a shame to put all that work and money into research and then to rush (so it seems) the account into print. Perhaps she feared that the meat of the story would scooped by the news media.I have read most of the theories on the identity of JTR, and hers is the most believable, but ""case closed"" is stretching it."
5,DNA validated--well done,I thought this was well done. The author proves rather well the guilt of a very very ugly and dispicable person.
1,Back to the bookstore,"I very seldom, if ever, re-sell a book. But this Cornwell book was one big disappointment. Not only did she fail miserably to make a convincing argument for her theory on Jack the Ripper, she did it in the most tedious and boring way. Arrrrgh. Of all the ""candidates"" for Jack the Ripper, her theory is the weakest and certainly not up to the investigative work she writes into her fictional Kay Scarpetta. I have always enjoyed Ms. Cronwell's books, but this one goes back on the market. What a waste.If you want to read a more compelling and convincing theory, pick up The Diary of Jack the Ripper by Maybrick."
2,not even an interesting theory,"I was really looking forward to reading Portrait of a Killer, I've been interested in Jack the Ripper since a trip to England and read some other works about him, mostly just this-is-what-happened casebooks. But this book was awful. The author blatently states that ""Ripperology"" is just something she picked up one day and decided to write a book on, and she didn't seem to to a very good job getting her research on the cases and the theory she has. After reading the speculations of Ripperologists, much more creative, I found her speculations boring, and it was the same old thing over and over again for pages, just ""look at the watermarks! Look at his pictures!"" This was the only real evidence the author had. This book was very boring. If you want a good read on Jack the Ripper try Donald Rumbelow's The Complete Jack the Ripper, it's a much better read and better written as well. Save your money on this one."
4,Great Mystery Solved?,"""Who is Jack the Ripper?"": the greatest true crime mystery ever, and this book tries to convince the reader that the mystery has been solved. Quite a persuasive case is made that Sickert is the fiend who haunted Whitechapel. More than anything, his violent paintings and drawings are the most persuasive evidence, one is even titled ""Jack the Ripper's Bedroom"". More conclusive DNA evidence would have thoroughly swayed me to the author's opinion. I have always loved to read any material related to the Ripper, so of course this book was a must. I still prefer to believe that conclusive evidence of who the Ripper really was has either never existed, or has been destroyed, either by time or by choice."
2,Not very good,"Ms Cornwell's novels are interesting if you have an interest in forensic science and detective novels. They appear to be well researched and flow smoothly which brings about a pleasent read. After reading Portrait of a Killer though, it is my conclusion that Ms Cornwell should stick to fiction. I have no doubt that she investigated the case thuroughly, but her narrative is confusing and unorganized; I can't believe an editor let this fly. I think that a plausable case against Mr Sickert could be made with the ""evedence"" that Ms Cornwell presents but it is doubtful that she would be able to convince a jury simply because everything seems to be out of order.Ripper buffs may get a kick out of her take on the facts."
3,Portrait of a Creepy Guy ... And No Solid Proof,"I'll have to join the chorus of others who have already made the point that, while interesting, Ms. Cornwell's book falls far short of ""closing the case"" on the Ripper murders. She makes some interesting points, but relies far too much on coincidences, similarities, and ""well it _could_ have happened like this.""For me, by far the most interesting aspect of the book was its description of the living conditions in the poorer parts of London in the 1880s. Life was truly ""nasty, brutish and short"" for the lower classes in England then, and their suspicion -- even hatred -- of the police certainly contributed to the slipshod investigation of the crimes. The primitive forensic tools of that era didn't help either!So, overall, I'd give the book a marginal ""thumbs up"" -- but with the caveats already noted."
2,Cornwell should stick to fiction,"I love Patricia Cornwell's books of Kay Scarpetta. But this book is a long, boring, monotonous read of her view that Sickert was Jack the Ripper. I saw nothing in this book that convinced me that he was Jack the Ripper and her conclusions seemed to me to be more guesswork than fact. I also found that her determination in presenting Sickert as the only possible killer and nothing could deter her from that idea (even the facts) to be annoying, frustrating, and slanted to her views. I do not recommend this book to anyone. I waded through, but wouldn't want to put anyone else through the agony if I could prevent it."
1,Teeeee-dious,"Let me start by saying I was a big Cornwell fan for a couple of her books, but decided her fiction was a little dark and her protagonist self-righteous and unsympathetic. I've continued to read her books hoping that she'll temper her holier-than-thou narrative style. Thus the purchase of this book.""She doesn't fail to disappoint"" comes to mind.Her narrative here is disjointed, she has no definitive conclusions and page after page of speculation. There were times I had to check the page numbers to make sure I hadn't skipped a page. Could she be absolutely correct in her assumptions? You betcha. Does she ""close the case""? You decide -- but don't buy this book, just borrow one from someone who's pitching it."
4,Case Closed? Are You Sure?,"This book by Patricia Cornwell is quite a read; her conclusions are very interesting. However, we know her conclusions from the very beginning of the book as it appears that she has focused on her one suspect and one, alone. The fact is that there have been dozens of JtR suspects named in the past century, though a number of these are highly improbable as Ripper suspects. Little to no attention is paid to any other suspects, but her one. This book would have been more thorough, had she focused on some of the other logical suspects, besides this one. However, I give this four stars, despite all of these thing. Cornwell has spent a great deal of time and money in researching this book. Though very onsided, Cornwell's reasearch can be a very valuable tool in research for other Ripperologist and I give this book four stars for it's research reference value."
3,It was okay,"Somehow I expected more. Not that Ms Cornwell didn't put forth some convincing evidence, but the manner in which she rambled from topic to topic to topic and back again, and the defensive tone of some of her arguments bothered me. I found the narrative hard to follow at times, as it bounced from modern DNA testing to Sickert's personality flaws to watermarks on stationery and so on. It's true that writing convincing non-fiction and gripping fiction are two very different talents. Worth a read, but has its tedious moments."
1,Not worth your time!,"I am usually a big fan of Cornwell's; I have read all her Scarpetta novels and was looking forward to seeing the same page-turner writing applied to a real, historical case. I was sorely disappointed. _Portrait of a Killer_ was 400 pages of asides, with occasional installments of an interesting story that could have been told in 100. Perhaps a reader truly obsessed with the Ripper case would appreciate the extensive biographical information about Sickert's father-in-law and other quasi-relatives and the historical details about art exhibits, etc, during the time period of the killings. For most, it is too much detail and not relevant enough to hold a reader's attention. I finished the book, hoping for some suspense, but there was no climax. It seems that Cornwell was simply told that 400 pages was enough, so she stopped there. Thank goodness."
2,Who wrote this book?,"As a Cornwell fan and having a moderate interest in the Ripper cases (sparked mainly by publicity for this book), I was looking forward to it's publication. Unfortunately, I had to force myself to finish what I felt was a poorly organized and hard to follow jumble of thoughts.I found the actual facts regarding the murders themselves slightly interesting and could even be convinced that Sickert was indeed the murder. But I felt as though I was reading a thesis written by someone half-heartedly.My advice to anyone interested in this book is to skip it. Save your money. I wish I would have. My advice to Cornwell... stick to Scarpetta."
3,Details...Details...Details,"While I very much enjoyded reading ""Portrait of a Killer"" I did find one error in Patricia Cornwell's research. In her book, she states that John Merrick suffered from von Recklinghaus disease. This is otherwise known as Neurofibromatosis. Merrick did NOT have this disesase. He may have had Protias, or some disorder so far unique to him. A special on the Discovery channel thoughory explored this matter. It was a special I watched wtih great interest, as I have NF Type 1. A small detail, and one that certainly doesn't question the evidence compiled in a very compelling case agains Sickert. Still it is a detain she wove into her tapestry which is a lose thread. While pulling it may not effect thhe greater picture, it does make me question what other threads may be lose or missing that could unravel her case."
2,"jack the ripper, case closed. My personal review","The book started off interesting enough, But the details and evidence linking W.R.S. to the crimes seem more than circumstantial to me, and as the book goes on the author fills the pages with uniteresting facts and life stories about people who have really no importance at all in the big picture. The thing that irritated me the most was how she compared crime scene investigation in that era to crime scene investigation now, I for one am aware that we've advanced considerably, Like I said earlier, there was alot ""page filling"" with unuseful information. I for one was not impressed nor do I believe the alleged and certainly unreliable police reports and eye- witness accounts documented over 100 years ago forming the basis of this book, It seems the documentation would have been unreliable even then.. There are some interesting things to consider in this book though, If you have any interest at all in ""Jack the Ripper"" its worth the read."
1,Interesting but very unconvincing,"Patricia Cornwell tries hard to separate herself from the usual run of Ripper books. And, she has some interesting conclusions to offer: usage of DNA testing on possible Ripper letters and the introduction of a possible new bit of evidence with the guest book of an inn in Cornwall.However, none of it is all that convincing. Her DNA testing may show that Sickert actually wrote a hoax letter, but it's a long step from there to calling him Jack the Ripper. The watermark evidence is interesting, but not conclusive at all. Her art analysis shows that Sickert was interested in death, nothing more.Ultimately, there are a number of independent sources that place Sickert in France during September of that year, quite possibly including all of October.Much of this seems to be the case of someone picking a suspect and doing their best to prove he was the one, rather than reviewing all of the information available."
1,What a waste of time and money!,Having been an amateur researcher into the ripper saga for many years now I am always open to new ideas and theories. Unfortunately this book fails to provide any convincing evidence to 'close the case' on the Jack the Ripper mystery. I am sure the author made lots of money from the book especially with the cliche title but she needs to stick to subjects she knows about.I treasure books when I buy them but admit this hardcover version went out with the trash when I finished it. And a few choice words about Ms Cornwall were heard too.Save your money and invest in something written by people such as skinner or evans who are masters of the game.
1,waste of time,This book was a waste of time. She had very little facts. It was like she wrote the book because she could. I wouldn't recommend reading this book if you have any interest in Jack the Ripper
2,Rarely has Cornwell disappointed me.,"I have, over the years, enjoyed Cornwell's Kay Scarpetta novels. Patricia Cornwell always does her research thoroughly on forensics and behavorial science, the FBI. She is very good at being accurate and a good story tellerIn Jack the Ripper Case Closed Cornwell is thorough. She takes modern day technology, science and evidence to reveal who Jack the Ripper really was. And in reading I find that she may have actually solved the case. But that is the problem with the book. Cornwell describes how she approached the case and reveals the true Ripper...but now you're still left with three quarters of a book to read. I continued on and on until I could not take the boredom anymore. This could be a very interesting book and in fact the first part is but in all it is a disappointment."
3,The use of language,"I admit that I am not nomally a fan of true crime books, and that I have never read any of Patricia Cornwell's books before. I do, however, have a degree in English. As for the theory itself, I feel that Ms. Cornwell makes a decent arguement. There is a lack of evidence, which is to be expected when the crimes were commited so long ago and the evidence was not all kept by the authorities. My biggest problems with this book come from the format and the use of language. Ms. Cornwell skips around so much in the way she tells the story that you easily loose track of the names, dates, and events themselves. I found it dificult to keep it all straight. If it were written in more of a time-line format, it would have been much easier to follow.Overall, the story is lost in the poor writing. Whether read for enjoyment, or historical interest, you are best to have a pen and paper handy if you want to make any sense of what you read."
1,A Waste of 28 Bucks!,"Fortunately, they weren't my 28 bucks. Borrowed my sister's copy of this book. Not history, not fiction. Just pure exploitive, gratuitously gossipy character assassination. Cornwell is fortunate that Sickert has no living heirs to silence this destruction of an artist's reputation.No footnotes, a lot of opinion and little else to persuade the reader of Cornwell's illogical conclusion. And, even if Cornwell could convince her audience (and she doesn't) that Sickert authored the Ripper letters, it is still a huge deductive leap to assume that the author of the letters was the killer.I was also shocked to learn that Cornwell bought some of Sickert's paintings and destroyed them in the failed attempt to extract forensic evidence.Cornwell is not a scientist, art historian nor historian. She should stick with her brand of weakly written fiction.Do I have to give it even one star?"
2,An Exercise in Self Absorbsion,"I found the author to be verbose. Too much of the book is information that only serves to fill pages with words. I found her research to be excellent, but her interpretation of this evidence takes one too many a leap of faith that is just not supported or justified. Time and again she says that she has no evidence to prove Sickert did certain things or was in certain places. She then turns and says she has no evidence to prove the opposite. When you base an entire book on the premise that it is impossible to prove a negative, you end up with the self absorbed clap trap that is the logic this author has produced in this book."
2,It won't hold my interest,"I am a person who HAS to finish a book once I start it. I am one third through this book and am considering putting it away. It is full of phrases like ""he may have...but he may not have"" in many MANY MANY different chapters and contexts. It is a long book of speculation with a few thought provoking clues here and there. Also it goes into a lot of information that has little to no relevence to Jack the Ripper. What in the world did the 4 pages refering to ""the elephant man"" have to do with anything?"
1,Don't watch her on C-SPAN,"If you're a fan of Ms. Cornwell, whatever you do: DON'T watch her discussion of the book on Book TV. You will be embarrassed by a semi-literate know-it-all who sprinkles her sentences with ""dese"" and ""dose"". A loyal reader may be shocked that this writer has actually been able to compose sentences and create an interesting novel or two. Unbelievable."
1,This Case Is Still Open,"Cornwell seems not to have read the large body of research done on Jack the Ripper. She proposes a case which hinges on the idea that many, maybe most, of the several hundred ""Ripper"" letters that were sent to the authorities were written by the real Ripper who was, in fact, Walter Sickert. She asserts that an artist could easily diguise his handwriting but offers no expert corroboration or proof. The touted DNA evidence is equally suspect. This is a disappointing book for anyone who has read anything about Jack the Ripper."
1,Do Not Bother Reading This Book,"Do not waste your money buying this book. Do not waste your time reading this book. A friend let me read her copy, but I could not finish it.As a scientist myself, I was appalled at the terrible psuedo-science in this book. The author has obviously never heard of ""the scientific method"" and ""the null hypothesis"". Instead, she sets out with the idea of proving that the killer is someone nobody else has considered and then interprets scant pieces of evidence that support her thesis as ""proof"" and ignores or brushes off any evidence to the contrary. There is so much speculation and so little real evidence that an intelligent reader will conclude that this book comes no closer to solving the ripper riddle than any of the other numerous books on this subject. Indeed, there are many more convincing books on the market."
1,"Cornwell's work is fiction, in my humble opinion.....","Cornwell has written a fictional account of ""Jack the Ripper""-it isn't even a ""good read"" in my opinion-yet she sells it as nonfiction. She provides no footnotes, et al.FACT: I wish I had my $$ back and Amazon had her book back."
4,Flawed but fascinating,"I finished ""Portrait of a Killer"" last night. The book was not one I would have chosen because I have lately tired of Cornwell's fiction, but as a Christmas gift from a friend,I read it. Only now have I looked at the Amazon.com reviews and guess what? I agree with almost all of the objections and petty complaints of the majority of the reviewers. Yes, it is overwritten, arrogant and sometimes illogical, but (and oh,what a ""but"") it is fascinating and compelling and altogether a great read. She has convinced me that Walter Sickert did write many of the Ripper letters although his guilt as the murderer remains in question. But never mind, for some reason I cannot explain, this flawed book is a page turner and I recommend it wholeheartedly."
1,The case is certainly not closed,"If this book reveals anything it is the grotesque hubris of Patricia Cornwell herself in giving her book such a ludicrous title. She had added nothing to the debate as to the identity of Jack the Ripper and has instead pushed her theory about Sickert, irrespective of the lack of real evidence. The author truly seems to believe that if she could prove that Sickert wrote the ripper letters, which she can not, then it would prove beyond a shadow of a doubt he actually committed the murders. The fact it has subsequently emerged that Sickert was almost certainly in France with his family the night of the double murder also makes her conclusion dubious in the extreme. I have never read any of Cornwell's fiction but I assume it must be somewhat more worthy than this drivel. A feeble effort and a waste of money."
2,I Was Forewarned,"Despite all of the negative reviews I wanted to read this book to find out for myself if it was really as bad as the critics have said. And.....it really was. I was most surprised that, for an accomplished writer, Patricia Cornwell wrote with such a lack of focus. It was as if she took a shotgun approach - blasting out clusters of speculations in hopes that some might randomly find the mark and stick as facts. The previous reviewers have all done a thorough job in delineating all of the non-facts and fallacies in her argument for fingering Walter Sickert as the infamous Jack the Ripper. No need to be redundant here.I did give ""Portrait of a Killer"" a generous two-star rating because a) I did finish the book, and b) it did contain a modicum of interest for me. However, in the end it was a totally unconvincing and unsatisfying read."
2,Too Much Information. Not Enough Substance,"Endless and tedious investigation of circumstancial evidence. I am convinced that Sickert may well be ""Jack"" but the case is not closed. Mostly I was irritated by the author's description of his paintings as evidence of his murderous personality, but without the corresponding illustrations, the basis escaped me. An okay historical perspective on the times of Jack the Ripper, an incomplete biography of Walter Sickert, a good but not complete attempt to convict him (the case is not closed). I only finished it because I kept hoping it would get better, but the last few chapters became even more rambling and disorienting."
1,ANOTHER RIPPER MURDER!,"I belong to a book group, and this is our pick for June, Cornwell's Portrait of a Killer -- Case Closed. This is my first reading of any of Cornwell's books and will likely be my last. I did not find this book gave me any concrete evidence, but, lots of circumstantial evidence. I couldn't find any hard evidence to support her contention that WS was the Ripper. I suppose I expected something quite diffrent from a woman who is a forensic expert and should not jump to conclusions. Besides, who wants to know who the Ripper really was, not me. I prefer to keep on reading various books about Jack and drawing my own conclusion. I am going to London on June 1st and I will take in the Ripper Walks, the London Dungeon and Victorian London, I am sure I will enjoy this more then I did Cornwells book."
1,Not One Shred of Real Evidence,"Cornwell's attempt to name the person who was ""Jack the Ripper"" fails miserably. She does not have one shred of real evidence to back up her theory. My recommendation is that she stick to fiction. Oh, wait! That is what this book is!"
2,"A little organization, please","I suppose that Ms. Cornwell's choice of who Jack the Ripper was is just as plausible as the other suspects (if not more so). However, I thought that the book was poorly put together. The book was just not that well put together. It just seemed as if the chapters were just arbitrarily put into the book. The ending about the events at Sickert's second wife's funeral had absolutely nothing to do with the book (unless Ms. Cornwell was trying to input some type of symbology into the end, which I didn't catch). Ms. Cornwell did do what she wanted to do in this book because I am sold on the idea that Sickert was Jack the Ripper, I just don't think that this book was very well written. I do think that Ms. Cornwell did the best she could by going over what little evidence that was left in a case that is over 100 years old, but reading this book makes me hope that her fiction books are better written than her attempt to write non-fiction."
3,Thanks!,"Finally I found out who Jack the Ripper was! For the longest time I thought if I ever wanted to know the true identity of Jack the Ripper I would have to go under cover as a man and join the Freemasons to learn all their secrets, since I heard on the Jack the Ripper tour I went on in like 1999 that the only people who really know who Jack the Ripper was are the Freemasons. Needless to say, reading this book has proved a lot easier than my previous plan. Thanks Patricia Cornwell!"
1,Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz,"This book was a Christmas present. By April, I had only made it halfway through. Why? I haven't been able to read more than three pages without falling into a nice, deep sleep."
2,"""Ripper"" not a ""barnburner""""","What's not to like? Murder fans' favorite unidentified serial killer and America's bestselling crime novelist together at last? Who could resist such a pairing! I read the much-anticipated latest from Patricia Cornwell with a great deal of disappointment. The style is tangential (or the organization of the material just escapes me); the evidence to support Sickert's guilt is compelling, but doesn't make for a good read, interspersed as it is with Ms. Cornwell's insistent speculation about his behavior and the meaning/connection of events. There is no tension in this book and, despite her success as a novelist, Ms. Cornwell is neither a forensic pathologist or a psychiatrist--how does she become such an expert on the evidence, then? And where is Kay Scarpetta when we need her most?"
2,Do your research before you accept this as truth,"Patricia Cornwell should stick to fiction as legitimate historical scholarship defeats her, her matter of fact claims are based on opinion not tangible evidence. The fact she spent six million dollars buying expert opinion to fit her opinions shows, I recommend anyone interested in her book visit the ... website for a balanced view..."
4,Totally Convinced!,"My little review will not mean very much coming on the heels of 611 previous ones. However, I have read nearly everything I could wrap my eyes and brain around on Jack the Ripper for many years.Patricia Cornwell has presented a case that is not only stronger than any other but contains worlds of information that had never been brought to the forefront. She makes connections that, had they been made close on the heels of the crimes, would have possibly led to the resolution.While some doubters are satisfied to accept the status quo on the identity of JTR, Cornwell has given us a candidate who, at the very least, fits the bill better than any other."
2,Poorly written,"The book was useful in educating me about the Jack the Ripper case, about which I knew almost nothing. However, the book is poorly constructed and confusing. The author may have a persuasive argument that the English painter Walter Sickert committed the crimes, but the book is so disorganized that it is difficult to determine. The endless reminders (one would have been sufficient) that police agencies in 1888 had virtually no forensic capabilies (and then to list what they couldn't do) are tedious."
2,"Sorry, case still open","Cornwell adds the artist Walter Sickert to a long list of Jack the Ripper suspects, but does little to prove her case. Sure, she has a fairly impressive pile of circumstantial evidence, but none of it, by itself, is at all convincing. She goes out on several limbs (the rather benign guest book at the end, which is owned by Cornwell. How's that for conflict of interest!), and leaves Sickert dangling from a noose she so eagerly wants him to fill. Some of the ""evidence"" is so speculative, her case would have been stronger if she left it out. The book takes the form of Cornwell playing prosecutor, agressively cross-examing a witness who is not alive to respond. In addition, the book is so poorly organized and so full of digressions that it is difficult to read. On the other hand, her descriptions of the East End of London, while derivative of other works, are well done, informative, and compelling."
1,DISAPPOINTING!,"I generally enjoy Cornwell's Scarpetta novels, finding them well-researched and intriguing. I also enjoy historical discussions of the Jack the Ripper murders and his possible identities. I found this book to be completely unorganized and poorly written. I was also skeptical of many of her assertions of ""facts"", wishing that she had substantiated more. I shut the book believing that Sikert was indeed a disturbed individual, but unconvinced that he was beyond a doubt Jack the Ripper."
1,Did anyone edit this book?,"As I read this book, I just kept wondering if anyone edited this book. And if so, has he or she ever heard that a narrative should have a certain flow and cohesiveness? This book was a jumble of personal thoughts and introspections, confused with a mixture of slanted ""evidence,"" doused with many unnecessary historical facts, and that was just chapter 1. Needless to say, I was not impressed."
2,Patricia Cornwell needs to stick to writing novels,"While I found this book entertaining, I cannot say Patricia Cornwell convinced me of anything more than the fact that she should stick to writing her Kay Scarpetta series. I thought this book was all over the place--jumping from one thing to the next & then back again. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes to entertain all of the theories about who Jack the Ripper was, but I would never tell anyone I believe what she is selling here."
3,Fact or Fiction,"I'm an avid reader of crime thrillers, so I know Patricia Cornwell well. Unfortunately, her latest attempt at non-fiction isn't as clearly organized as her thrillers. A few charts and timelines would help the reader understand all the murders she attributes to Sickert. As for objectivity, Cornwell misses the mark, since she only presents facts that support her theory. She could learn a thing or two about presenting the facts in an entertaining yet objective manner from investigative reporter Anthony Summers' who wrote ""Goddess: The Secret Lives of Marilyn Monroe,"" an excellent and well-researched book regarding the assasination of Marilyn Monroe.However, if you want to better understand violent psychopathy and how forensic medicine is utilized, Cornwell does a wonderful job on both of these topics. Overall, not her best writing effort, but worth the read to understand the diseased psychopathic soul."
2,Too much Fluff,How did she zero in on this one person? She never gave definitive reasons why the other's were not guilty of being the ripper.
1,dumb with a little bit of color,most of the reviews nail the stupidity of this tome... its frustrating how something that has garnered so much attention could be so poorly constructed... for me the main point is this: contemporary artists are very very frequently fascinated by grim current events... certainly no less in victorian times and Sickerts being interested in the murders and naming some of his work after what was a huge media event at the time is a pretty feeble reason for naming him as the killerthere is a little bit of color here but on the whole this is an exploitative travesty... also Sickert was a truly great painter... anyone who looks at a bunch of his work should see how ridiculous these claims are... are there any actual serial killers on record who went on to have major careers in the arts? or vice versa? this is a silly hollywood conception
1,Proof in the negative,"This book is an unorganized list of factoids and speculation. I kept waiting for the punchline, but her ""case"" falls apart because of her approach of assuming the positive by attempting to prove the negative. Her continual statements such as ""I see no reason why Sickert wouldn't have been there. . ."" get extremely tedious and increasingly unconvincing. She can't prove Sickert was in Whitechapel by failing to find him elsewhere. She can't prove he wrote the Ripper letters just because he was a talented artist who could have written in many different styles. The only things she DID prove was that forensic science was abysmal and that most people didn't care about the women who were murdered.There is no smoking gun - just a bunch of could've would've should've."
1,Shabby yet arrogant attempt at non-fiction,"This book cannot be taken seriously. The author hangs her conclusions on ethereal threads of conjecture and intuition; one supposition after the other, that somehow become ""facts."" A backward step for anyone interested in this case."
1,Who needs research?,A book on historical matters thats what! The whole book seemed contrived from the very beginning. This was the absolute bottom of the barrel of the Jack the Ripper books in my opinion.
1,monontonously irrelevant details = boring,"Do I really care to know how a Virginia Forensic Team would have handled a crime scene from the 1800's? There are so many needless details in this book that lead me to skim and scan to find the good parts. Like others say, there are way too many ""probably"" this and ""probably"" that statements. Regardless of all the nice reviews from the press, I think this book is a frustrating mess! I preferredThe Last Victim: A True-Life Journey into the Mind of the Serial Killer."
1,"A painful, arduous read.","I couldn't wait to finish this book, not because it was so engrossing, but because it was a chore to read through her maze of ""evidence"" and her scattered, back-and-forth time frame jumping. I won't rehash other problems with the book, since other reviewers here have done such a wonderful job of poking holes in the author's theory and critiqued her writing style. I would merely like to add that it is telling that on the cover of the book the author's name is significantly larger than the title.Interpret that as you may."
1,Truly appaling,"I have always been interested in forensics and behavioral psychology, so when I saw this book on the shelves I bought it immediately. I have never been so disgusted with a book in my life. Both Cornwell's writing and her ""evidence"" are just embarrassing. All this book proves is that her ego has far surpassed her talent. The majority of her ""evidence"" consists of: ""There's no reason to suspect he wasn't in London that night,"" or ""he might possibly have walked home this way."" Her so-called forensic evidence (DNA and handwriting) are inconclusive and less than convincing. The entire book is nothing more than any of her other books: fiction. I'm embarrassed to even own it. Try John Douglas's nonfiction instead if you want real criminal science."
1,WORST RIPPER BOOK EVER WRITTEN,"It was painful to finish - manufactured evidence, misinterpreted evidence, wild assumption, and extreme melodrama. Not worth your time."
1,Narcissistic Indulgences,"I think what irritates me the most about this book is Cornwell herself. She is not a forensic expert, not a psychologist specializing in abnormal or clinical pathological behavior, not a specialist of brain dysfunction, and not a historian, yet makes claims to all of the above in her audacious statement of having ""solved"" a hundred plus year old historic event. She handles history clumisly, ignoring context (e.g. suggesting fear of blood-borne pathogens, hardly a concern for the Victorian age), gives misleading neurologic information (cites frontal lobe deficit as tantamount to homicidal profile), and uses terms like ""psychopath"", couched in psychiatric jargon that is no longer current. What we have here is speculation, albeit interesting, with very little actual evidence. She is afterall a fiction writer. Perhaps she should stick to that."
4,Interesting Verdict,"Cornwell presents a good case, although not without flaws, for whom she believes the killer to be. This book took a lot of criticism when it was first released, but it is very well researched and documented. Definitely worth the read by any true crime fan."
2,If she said so ...,"I just don't believe what I read in this book, first of all let me tell you that this book could be written in 50 pages, all the stories around the main story are boring and boring, and she compares what would happened if Jack the Ripper were alive in these days, how would you know that? When you write a story that really happened you don't compare what would happened if that story would be in our days.I wrote a book of the story of Cleopatra and I wrote my novel in the Antarctica, but I never made any comparison if Cleopatra were alive today, you just can't do that.I put 2 stars to this book because I just can't put one star to a book.But at the end you really think that Patricia Cornwell knows who was Jack the Ripper?"
2,Bad logic...,"Although Ms. Cornwell does provide much of the common data used by modern ""Ripperologists"" and provides a handful of new propositions, the book is fragmented and redundant in tone. Huge liberties are taken in her deductions and square pegs are forced into round holes more violently than the Ripper dealt deathblows. I imagine the only reason this book was released was to offset the losses she occurred in her obsessive and extravagant research of the case. IN SHORT: I would not recommend this as a Ripper primer, but only if you are interested in the greater span of Ripper theories."
2,"Little Substance, Much Inuendo","Cornwell presents absolutely no facts for her case. Moreover, she reveals an overall lack of knowledge about the case; not suprising since before she started the book she admitted she knew hardly anything about the Ripper murders.Instead of presenting facts, Cornwell shamelessly maligns a great artist with her blind, baseless assumptions. At best, she might have a case for Sickert having written a few hoax letters, but there were thousands of such hoax letters and absolutely none of them have ever been successfully tied to the killer.I think Cornwell should stick to writing fiction, for she certainly is no journalist and doesn't seem to understand the difference between investigative reporting and stroy telling."
2,"Use it as a reference book, not a novel","Patricia Cornwell's attempt to pinpoint Jack the Ripper is presented in this novel. However, this account is somewhat presented as a reference novel; that is, this book goes through historical material and heresay.What ""Portrait of a Killer"" is not is a historical fiction novel that takes you through the events as if it is 1888 and you are able to see Scotland Yard unfold with Sickert as Jack the Ripper. If you're looking for an entertaining historical-based fiction novel, this is not it."
2,"A ""Circumstantial"" account of Jack The Ripper","At first, I was excited to read this account because I have been such a fan of the case. However, upon conclusion of the last page, I was still asking the question, ""Who Dunnit?""As a few other reviewers have already noted, Ms. Cornwell bombards the reader with a more circumstantial ""evidence"" like similar handwriting and watermarks used by Sickert, and an overabundance of verbiage. The closest she comes to any type of proof is a few traces of mitochondrial DNA on an envelope which does not even lead back to Sickert himself. She seems to spend most of her time with quotes such as ""Sickert most likely was here..."" or ""Chances are Walter Sickert used the same..."". It appears she felt more of a need to prove to us her knowledge of foresnics rather than prove the case."
1,Case wide open,"While I have tremendously enjoyed the Kay Scarpetta series of Cornwell's, her attempt at real-life detective work and forensics in the Ripper case is probably heroic, but ultimately, unfulfilled. There is no denying that she has approached the Ripper riddle armed with the latest in forensic technology and has made a credible argument for Sickert. However, the case is far from closed. Cornwell's success with her body of fictional work lends credence to the title of the book, ""Jack the Ripper Case Closed,"" but to say that the case is closed is misleading at best... Moreover, the book was far from a pleasant read, and not for reasons of blood and gore. Rather, poor grammar, tortured syntax, and lack of overall organization all combine with the oversold title to make this Ripper book a [bad choice]."
1,Case Closed? Not Even Close!,"This book was filled with speculation, unsubstantiated rumors, unsupported suppositions and pure conjecture. Cornwall owes the family a big apology."
1,Big Disappointment,"I am a Cornwell/Scarpetta fan, and find all of her fiction well written, intriguing, and fun to read. However, this book is so poorly written and so completely unorganized that it takes away from the incredible research and the exclusive story. The editor within me wanted to take this material and organize, re-write and give it some continuity and congruence. Overall, the book is a unique and an execeptionally well researched answer to the Jack the Ripper mystery, but the reader has to yank and pull to get the story and the facts out of the book."
3,"ok, but not case closed","Although I enjoy the writings of Pat Cornwell, and respect that she has indeed worked with some professionals, I don't think that she can truthfully say ""case closed"" on this issue. The way she goes about writing is excellent, but to assume she knows all the answers to this case is a bit conceited."
2,"Probable, but could have been organized better","My philosophy is that a lot of coincidences usually add up to something bigger. Even though there was no DNA, Cornwell relied on basic detective work. I buy her theory.On to the nitty gritty, this book lacked organization. For example, a murder would happen on September 1, years would pass, and then we were back to another murder that happened around the time of murder one. I like things to go in chronological order. Call me crazy, but my brain works better when things are laid out in proper order.Kudos on the great detective work, but the lack of organization made the book a pain in the butt to read."
2,Case Closed?,"Cornwell has uncovered some suggestive but far from definitive evidence, which leads her to conclude that the artist Walter Sickert was responsible for the Jack the Ripper murders, as well as others never ascribed to the Ripper. Her approach is inflated and highly speculative--lots of ""would have-could have-must have""--and rests to a surprising degree on pseudo-Freudian ""profiling"" of Sickert. Illustrations that compare known drawings of Sickert's to Ripper letters are interesting, but also be prepared for some gory and (I think) gratuitous crime scene and autopsy photographs. The book was a disappointment, and I returned it to Amazon less than 24 hours after its arrival."
3,"Well, it made some money, didn't it?","This is a book made to generate income. It worked. As a plausible case for the identification of Jack the Ripper, it's lacking. Of course it is. It's a crime novel. It has to return to the excitement and gut-wrenching details; it can't -- it's not allowed to, in this genre! -- linger too long on the science or the law or the history. It already ""errs"" in that direction too much to be an effective crime novel. And unfortunately too little to be an effective legal or forensic assessment of the Ripper or of Sickert. I think the author, editors, and publishers -- and all the other media folks who jumped on this bandwagon -- played their game very well. And the rest of us can enjoy the ride, remembering that is an amusement after all."
5,Excellent research and storytelling,"This book is a wealth of information. Instead of relying on theories, Ms. Cornwell investigates these crimes as if they just happened. The book was compulsively readable. I bought it the first day it came out and barely put it down for two days except to go to work!I have to say that I am convinced that Walter Sickert was Jack the Ripper. Cornwell's handwriting and language experts looked at his letters and way of writing and compared them to Ripper letters. I don't want to give too much away but your jaw will drop as this mystery is exposed."
2,Case Closed - NOT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I am sorry, this is nothing but sensationalism. Cornwell is being manuplitive, cashing in on the Jack the Ripper interest to push her books. It makes nice fiction, but she is off target in labelling Walter Sickert as the Ripper and borders on foolishness in saying case closed and Sickert was Jack.If anyone bothered to see the BBC interview or read Stephen Knight's Book, you would have learned Sickert was involved in the whole mess, but she totally missed the point. Sickert was a player, a user, possibly a blackmailer - and conceivably was pointing out the targets as ""Jack"" hunted for Mary Kelly.But to claim 'case closed'....that is as false a claim as Sickert was the Ripper."
4,Is it possible to solve a murder 100+ years after the fact?,"Cornwell does an amazing job of research and applying modern technique to this case. The possibility is very probable that this man could very well have been Jack the Ripper.The reality is, we will never know. For true Ripper enthusiasts, I think half the intrigue is not knowing.I think the book was a little chaotic and unorganized. Her theories are amazing and well thought out. I could not put the book down. It is a great read, however, I don't think the case will ever be closed."
2,Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper --case not closed,"As a long time fan of Patricia Cornwell's books, this was my first major disappointment with her work. Based on her presentation, the case is not closed! She offers many circumstantial bits and pieces, but is far from proving her case. I am surprised that she would weaken her reputation for careful work by releasing this volume and even more surprised that a publisher would print it. While offering some interesting insights into police work and crime during the era of Jack the Ripper, and while possibly eliminating one or two of the traditional suspects, this work fails to convince and had her ""evidence"" been presented at trial, I suspect he would have gone free. Patricia, return to writing what you do best and apologize to your fans for this mediocre work. It is not worthy of you."
2,Book Mis-Named,"I am a huge Patricia Cornwell fan. I have all her books. I realize this was a very different project for her to undertake. However, I feel the book should have been titled ""Biography of Walter Sickert"". I also feel that all the evidence sumbitted was circumstancial. I also found the book to have to much irrelevant information. However, I did find the book interesting but I am not convinced that Walter Sickert was Jack the Ripper. I have read other Jack the Ripper books which in my opinion were much more conviencing.I anxiously await the release of BLOW FLY in October and remain a huge Patricia Cornwell fan."
1,Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper -- Case Closed,"While I don't disagree with Cornwell's assessment that Walter Sickert could have been Jack the Ripper, I found the book a very disappointing read. From her Scarpetta novels, I expected a tightly wrapped story. Instead I felt she was all over the place -- her personal struggle with the material, as ourlined in her conversation with her editor in the 1st chapter, added nothing to the story in my opinion. Her constant harping on what would be done today in an investigation did not add to the original thesis of the book -- to prove that Sickert was the killer -- and was distracting. Her laundry list of unsolved murders post 1888 was reptetitive and redudant."
2,But is it true?,"I found the book interesting reading, but not powerful science as the other reviews would indicate. Rather than take my word on some of the issues, you might like to read what a DNA specialist says about some of the flaws of Cromwell's DNA evidence: ""Neither History Nor Science"" By Terry Melton_The Scientist_, Volume 17, Issue 3, p.16 (Feb.10 2003) ..."
2,What A Mess!!,"I've read several other reviews and just had to throw in my 2 cents worth. I too re-sold my book, which is something I have never done with a brand new book before. Sure I lost money, but I also lost several hours reading!! I've enjoyed the author's fictional books and couldn't wait to read this one. How disappointing! Disjointed, full of conjecture, information notated under photos that was never mentioned in the text, with a totally lousy ending that kind of petered off. The book felt unfinished, like that of a pre-teen writer who had to turn in a book report on Monday morning and wasn't quite done. (I've been there, so it was easy to recognize.) I was unfamiliar with Walter Sickert and would have really appreciated seeing at least one picture of his work to realize what a talented artist he was and why he was famous. Maybe he was Jack the Ripper, but Patricia Cornwell's argument was absolutely unconvincing. I think she's damaged her reputation with this one."
2,IMPOTENT FURY!,"""I knew the identity of a murderer and couldn't possibly avert my gaze"" so states Cornwell. Give me a break. Enough people have spent their time defending Sickert now, so I won't take up the space. Though he could be a suspect... The Jack the Ripper cases will most likely never be solved. Some people kinda' want it that way.This is a good book for its documentation of the killings. Its also good for its in depth, yet ungrounded Sickert accusations; such as him having had a fistula. Pure speculation. I don't know if that would really be enough to drive a man to mutilate... but it doubtlessly would drive a person mad with ""impotent fury""! And other phrases that will leave you giggling."
1,Slow read,"I found this to be a hard read. The author jumped all over the place and made it hard to follow. I don't think she made a good case against the ""Ripper"" no matter how hard she tried to tie unrelated facts together. Most of it was speculative at best with little or no hard evidence."
1,Did she really put genuine effort into this?,"With such piercing logic along the lines of ""I can't find any evidence he was there, so that proves he did it"", is it any wonder I have no desire to read any of her other books?"
1,"portrait of a killer, jack the ripper case closed","By far the worst book Patricia Cornwell has written. Instead of a compelling story, this one is fragmented and a real chore to read. The font is so tiny that it is hard to read. I love all her books except this one. Her Sarpetta series are hard to put down, this one I cant wait to put down, in fact I may not finish it."
1,"No, the Case is NOT Closed","Just because Patricia Cornwall spent a lot of her own money investigating Walter Sickert, does not mean that Walter Sickert was Jack the Ripper. I got sick of her writing style, especially when she told the reader NUMEROUS times that you can't get DNA from ashes (Sickert was cremated). Okay, I think we get it, once was enough. I didn't see any conclusive proof presented. She would say things such as, ""There was no evidence that Sickert was in town the night of this murder, but there's no evidence that he wasn't either."" Well, that certainly narrows it down. He must be The Ripper!A long-winded waste of time. Can't recommend."
1,Cornwell steals from Steven Knight,"Stephen Knight first formulated the Walter Sickert connexion to the Jack the Ripper slayings in Knight's book ""Jack the Ripper: the Final Solution."" It's nothing new. Ms. Cornwell shouldn't take credit for this as she does here. It's dishonest."
1,Case Still Open,"After expending a great deal of ink and, reportedly, a large amount of cash, Patricia Cornwell has succeeded in proving that some of the hoax letters purportedly written to the authorities by Jack the Ripper MAY have originated with the painter Walter Sickert. Hardly an earth-shaking discovery...hardly worth writing another book about. (Sickert was previously identified as a suspect by Stephen Knight in 1976 and by Jean Overton Fuller in 1990.) Absolutely no new evidence linking Sickert to the murders is presented. Ms Cromwell would have been better advised to save her money and our time."
1,Portrait of an idiot!,"I really have enjoyed nearly all of Cornwell's fiction. I have admired the versimilitude of her work and respected her as a former coroner in Virginia. I have even enjoyed some of her non-fiction as well--""Recipes to Die For"" is a hoot and I have enjoyed using her mandatory literary cookbook.Portrait of a Killer, on the other hand, is a sad effort. If you enjoy sophistries, non sequitors, logical fallacies, and a myriad of assorted inanities then this is the book for you. I found this one of the most annoying books I have ever read.She spent a lot of money producing this book and seems to have gotten caught up in the process. Poor Walter Sickert and his descendents! I hope that the family successfully sues Cornwell.One piece of advice: Don't Bother!"
1,Poor - at best.,"A poorly written account of an interesting subject. The editor should be ashamed at letting this one go to the presses.All of the ""evidence"" is circumstantial at best - and more precisely; ridiculous. The only value this book can be said to have, is a interesting link between Sickert and one of the hoaxed Ripper letters. Don't waste your time or money."
1,"Poorly reasoned, poorly written","Cornwell's attempt to prove painter Walter Sickert was Jack the Ripper left me not only unconvinced, but confused. Her book is full of irrelevant digressions and unfounded assumptions. A good editor should have helped Cornwell better focus her ideas. (Perhaps an editor tried, and Cornwell's baffling book is the result.)Cornwll flits from one subject to another every few pages, rarely stating a hypothesis, offering supporting evidence and reaching a conclusion. She offers far too many ""could haves"" and ignores or dismisses any evidence that doesn't support her ideas.Writers far better than I (Stephen P. Ryder or Wolf Vanderlinden) have articulated the many problems with Cornwell's hypothesis. Find their articles online and read their analyses."
2,Add another theory to the pile!,"Interesting theory but Case Closed? I don't think so! There are some remarkable points made here and should be read by anyone interested in Jack the Ripper. However Patricia Cornwell's policy of, there is no evidence to prove I'm right, but there is no evidence to prove I'm wrong so I must be right, just doesn't cut it, pardon the pun. As far as saying it must be true because the experts said they would arrest Sickert, anyone can find an ""expert"" to agree to anything. Doesn't mean as much as it used too! So all in all, read the book for a good possibility for who The Ripper was, but don't expect that we've put the mystery to bed just yet."
1,Freelance writer,"This book would make an excellent college casebook for teaching logical fallacies. It is replete with prime examples of the errors of circular argument and tautological inference. As history, it is beyond flawed."
2,Not Worth a Flip,"...at least two stars for effort and being so damn silly! i'm not one to be a party of a pooper, but this book sucks the big green weenie. good photos tho... ."
2,No compelling element,"As an avid Cornwell and true crime reader, I couldnt wait to get my hands on this book. I read the excerpt in Vanity Fair and found it less than compelling but I was certain the actual book would be better. It was not. Cornwell does not prove her case scientifically as I had hoped. She does create a strong circumstantial case. Her writing is cloudy and she harps on the same points too many times--almost to the point of making them ludicrous in the reader's eyes.This book will certainly be a disappointment for Cornwell fans. It also will not do much for Ripper scholars. I would check it out at the library but not purchase a copy."
1,Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzz!,I admire the intrepid readers who were able to slog through this tedious book long enough to form a conclusion as to whether Sickert was or was not Jack the Ripper. I'm willing to take Cornwell's word for it. Just don't ask me to try reading the book again.
4,Portrait of a Killer,"Jack the Ripper, people have had a fascination about him for many years. This is the best of Cornwell's books. She researched this case and gives her readers an authentic view of what probably happened in London in 1888. Her personal knowledge of forensic science enabled her to identify the author of the Ripper's letters. I have read and seen many ideas of who the identity of Jack the Ripper was. Cornwell has the best answer to this old question. By Ruth Thompson the author of ""The Bluegrass Dream"""
2,An editorial nightmare,"Where was her editor? Although Ms. Cornwell's prose is well-written, the ideas in this book jump around in a very distracting manner. Just when she is developing one idea or factual scenario, she will go off on a tangent and either not finish the first idea or come back to it so much later that the reader has forgotten where he was. It's as if the whole book were written as an initial draft and any ideas that popped into her head (""that reminds me"") were added right then and there.I thought her premise and much of her evidence were quite interesting, and I learned a great deal about the Ripper cases, which I have always found fascinating. However, I never thought that a writer of Ms. Cornwell's caliber and ability would publish a book so amateurishly constructed. Her points could have been made far more forcefully had the book been better organized."
3,Case Closed?,"I admire Patricia Cornwell's fiction writing. She is one of the best authors out there in the fiction genre. Her skills as a non-fiction writer however, leave some things to be desired. Her research is meticulous, but, it seems to be grasping at some points, especially in reference to Sickert's art. She also bogs down in some areas when trying to prove her point, making the reader get lost in factoids. The ending, was the most disappointing aspect of this book, and led me to question the merit of writing such a sweeping indictment of a single person."
3,Mind Boggling - Requires a strong stomach,"I thought perhaps this book, being a research paper / investigative report, would be a boring, lifeless (pardon the pun) collection of prose that would bore me to tears.I have read many a police report that bored me to tears.Though Patricia confesses that she did not want to do this book, but that she was compelled by the need to set things right, she has done a wonderful job of interjecting her personality and wit into something that was a completely horendous series of crimes.She did a wonderful job of putting forth her theory. And I commend her for overcoming her reservations and producing it. Sometimes, you just have to do things even when you would rather not."
3,A BIT CONFUSED,"I READ MY FIRST BOOK BY PATRICIA CORNWELL AND I HAV'T TO SAY THAT I WAS A BIT CONFUSED ABOUT WHERE THE AUTHOR WAS GOING. THE BOOK WAS WRITTEN WERE IT WOULD TAKE A POLICE DETECTIVE ; OR A FORENSIC SCIENTIST TO UNDERSTAND. I NOTICED THAT SHE KEPT REPEATING HERSELF WHEN IT CAME TO THE FORENSIC SCIENCE IN THE BOOK. SHE KEPT REPEATING OF WHAT WE COULD DO NOW, IF WE HAD THE EVIDENCE NOW THAT EXISTED BACK THEN. WELL THIS IS 2003 AND WE DON'T . SO I DON'T BELIEVE 100% THAT WALTER SICKERT WAS JACK THE RIPPER. CASE CLOSED!"
5,Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper-- Case Closed by Patri,"I recently read this book and found it extremely believable. I believe Ms. Cornwell has discovered who Jack the Ripper really was and she did a great job.I have been interested in Jack the Ripper since my twenties and I really feel this case can be closed once and for all. I think most people will feel this is not a factual book, but that's because they want to keep the ""mystery"" of these hideous crimes going. I LOVE mysteries, but I also love to solve them and in my mind Ms. Cornwell did just that. Read this book and judge for yourself. She made a believer out of me."
2,Term Paper,This book would be perfect if you are into reading term papers. I personally enjoy the Kay Scarpetta series and thought this books was too dry and boring to say the least.
2,The title: CASE CLOSED???!! WHAT???,"Cannot believe that a rich and well suceeded suspence novelist like Patrycia could write such junk, and, worse still, call it CASE CLOSED!"
3,Good prose ... poorly edited,"I am not a ""Jack the Ripper"" expert - so I cannot compare or contrast this book to competing theories. While the book was well written and painstakingly researched ... it was poorly organized. It jumped back and forth on timeline and content. It reads more (from a flow standpoint) like a second draft. It looks like the editor was in a rush to get this published and they relied on the author's name and subject matter to sell the book. While the evidence is compelling, I think the subject would have been better served if she had compared or debunked the other theories. I few charts and grids would have helped for some time-line comparisons. From an ""O.J."" perspective, she might have enough to get a civil judgement against the ""accused"" but I don't think there is enough to get a criminal conviction. Glad I read it but it sure was ponderous."
1,Portrait of an author's ego,"To quote the author herself, ""It is sad that men whose lives and careers were touched by the Ripper cases would spin theories almost as baseless as some of those offered by people who weren't even born at the time of the crimes."" Patricia Cornwell case is as baseless as those she criticizes. It offers little more than an ego trip, with occasional salacious details, often unrelated, to keep the average reader titillated. She offers little of substance to prove her case. Rather, she starts with an assumption, not even original to her, and warps facts to fit her hypothesis. And the book is not even well written. It is poorly organzed and jumpy."
1,Case closed? What a joke!,"It takes very little actual research to determine that Cornwell's alleged murderer was in France when the murders occurred. Cornwell unaccountably goes to extremes to twist and distort facts and jump to false conclusions to accuse Walter Sickert. She mischaracterizes evidence and presents opinions as evidence. Why Cornwell became obsessed with Sickert is a mystery, but she should be ashamed of herself for making money slandering an innocent artist. If you enjoy reading the National Enquirer, you might be obtuse enough to enjoy this book. Case closed? What a joke!"
1,Total speculation,"Ms. Cornwell may be a good fiction writer, but this book is bad! She jumps around far to much, and her entire claim is nothing but speculation. To give an example she shows a drawing by her suspect Sickert entitled ""He killed his father,"" and states that the ""wooden bed"" in the drawing is the same as that in the photo of the Ripper's victim Mary Kelly..... Well duhhhh.. as if wooden beds were rare in the Victorian age! To top it off when one looks at the bed in the drawing, and the bed in the photo you will see that there is NO similarity between the two at all!"
2,Not Finished But Already Disappointed,"I love the Kay Scarpetta novels and can't wait for the next. I just wish Patricia Cornwell had used her considerable talent writing a new Scarpetta instead of this book. I have just started reading Case Closed and already have noticed some glaring errors. In the first chapter she mentions the Duke of Edinburgh birthday. I think she means the Prince of Wales as the title ""Duke of Edinburgh"" was created for Prince Phillip. Also she claims the first victim of Jack The Ripper to be Martha Tabran. Every other Ripper book lists this woman as Tabram. These are just two examples of sloppy research and I've only read three chapters. All the money spent on the research for this book and she couldn't hire a fact checker?"
1,Bad,"Can anyone say ""redundant?"" Do publishers no longer employ editors? This book is a excellent 25-page paper crammed into a 300-page book."
3,Interesting Observations,"I think the main problem with this book is the title doesn't work for the content. There isn't enough ""proof"" to say this case is closed - just my opinion. I admire the author's tenacity and research - and some of Sickert's paintings do illustrate a certain ""chill."" Creatives often can't help weaving current events into their works - whether consciously or not. This could very well be the case with Sickert - these murders may have been resting in his subconscious, and finding there way into his paintings. Who knows? The handwriting analysis may be the most convincing piece of evidence but it's acknowledged that many letters and decoys were sent to officials. Great read, stirring and peaked my curiousity, but I don't know this case can be ""officially"" closed."
3,An Interesting Read,"Patricia Cornwell presents a well researched book, attempting to solve murders that occured over 120 years ago. Given the time that has passed, her evidence is pretty shaky, and she makes some conclusions that are reaching, to say the least. However, because she offers evidence exonerating other popular suspects, in the end, I don't see any more plausible conclusion."
3,Is Jack the Ripper case really closed?,"I've been a fan of Patricia Cornwell for a long time. Kay Scarpetta is a really a great character for her novels.This book was really different for her. It was hard to get into this novel. Unlike her others you knew it wasn't true but you read it anyway. I expected this novel to be somewhat in the same format as her others, knowing this was supposed to be somewhat factual.Although Cornwell had many facts on this Sickert person alot of the evidence against him were circumstancial. This seems to be more of her theories than actual proof.I somewhat liked this novel because the history was interesting, but disappointed because there's still doubt on whether he was the true ""Jack the Ripper"". I think there needs to be more investigating to be done. Maybe some day we'll find out, very doubtful though.Thank you Patricia for a facinating theory. You are still one of my number one fan."
4,"ONe of the most riveting , frightening novels written","This book was amazing. It details life in Victorian England like no other story written. The evidence all adds up and points to this man Sickert. The story will repulse and intrique you at the same time. Her research is thorough and the case is closed! Jack the Ripper is at rest. A great story. It jumps around a little, but is easy to keep up."
2,PortraitOf a theory.BringSickertBackSoHeCanSueForLibel,"I read the book and thought it was quite convincing... until I later listened to the book on tape. She does take a methodical and forensic approach to the subject, as I have read in no other.For those who read the book and were convinced, do us a favor listen to it unabridged in tape/CD. Listen to it as if you were a juror in a modern day courtroom. It was then that I started noticing the leaps she takes from forensic theory to actual application to the man Sickert.I give it 2 stars because it is a theory as other investigations of it are theory and entertaining at the time. However ALL other theories, such as the one proposed in the ""From Hell"" graphic novel and movie (which is based on someone else's theory, i forget who) should not be viewed as superior because they are just that, theories.One is just as plausible and/or implausible as the other."
2,Jack the Rippper,"I was unhappy with this effort from Patricia Cornwell. I found it repetitive, hard to follow and didn't find her argument that convincing."
3,Bit boring!,"There are some interesting passages and sundry information but overall it is bit boring! Patricia is more concerned to show us how intelligent she and her fellow investigating team are! Dear person, you're very intelligent and your team is best in the world, but why repeat it so often. Are you, my dear, not sure of the fact yourself? There are some gory photos and such details that you would nearly puke!Having castigated the author, I would say that she has been able to recreate a picture (in my mind) of those bygone times. Just think, 100 years from now people will be interpreting the lives we're leading right now! How morbidly quaint!"
1,First and last time.,"I've read many of the reviews already posted here, and there isn't much more I can add. This is the first Cornwell book I have read, and it will likely be the last. As a former police officer, I was always told to be careful ""not to make the evidence fit the suspect"". Cornwell seems to draw as much from her imagination as from the facts. Did she research other suspects as thoroughly as Sickert or did she mold her evidence to suit her literary needs? I found the book poorly written and badly edited.I'm glad I waited to borrow it from the library and did not spend money on it."
1,I have no respect for Particia Cornwell,"Firstly the case is not closed, she merely provides a hole filled theory. I lost all respect for her when she was interviewed regarding people refuting her claims. She repiled that people did not aggree with her because ""I am a woman and an American"". Grow up, how embarrasingly sad. Just write, don't talk."
4,An intriguing book,"I had a hard time putting this book down. I found it entertaining. I did not see all the connections between Sickert and Jack the Ripper, but there are many. I do not know all the facts, but she certainly did alot of research. This case will never be fully closed until DNA testing gets better and by then any samples will likely be too degraded."
2,"Too many ""maybes""","While the Walter Sickert theory presented in this book does seem quite sound, Patricia Cornwell seems not to have known where she was going with the story. Halfway between a crime novel and an exposé, she presents some valid facts to support the theory, but returns much to often to pure speculation. Maybe he was at the funeral, maybe not. Maybe he spoke to her, maybe not. In a book like this, the point is not to speculate and imagine, but to give concrete answers. Why call it ""case closed"" if there's still so much that's unclear?"
1,Could have been done better.,"Let me start by saying I love Patricia Cornwell. Her Kay Scarpetta novels are among my favorites and I've read every one.When I saw this book I was totally intrigued, I'm also fascinated by true crime. Figuring Jack the Ripper is long gone, not so much of the nightmares to coincide with the read.However, the book was a disapointment. The research is commendable, but the book is not a smooth read. She jumps around so much from the killer to the era to modern day. If it was a smooth, consistent story it would have been great! I'm ashamed to say I couldn't even finish and I rarely stop a book half way through.Again, good plot, but could have been written in a much clearer manner."
2,Case Closed-- leaves much to desire,"I bought this book thinking it would be the ultimate read but unfortunately been unable to finish it becuase I keep falling asleep. I had never purchased a book from this author but was familiar with her reputation as a good writer. Unfortunately, that's all it is. The book reads like an instruction manual and the author skips from the present to the past without giving the reader any transition information. The vocabulary can get a bit tricky at times (u might need to get a dictionary at times if you are not a lawyer or in the criminal justice field) and it just reads poorly. I found it to be boring, not what you would expect from Patricia or a book about Jack the Ripper."
2,Case Closed? I Don't Think So.,"What a huge disappointment. Even after reading this book, I don't know how Cornwell can say, with confidence that Walter Sickert was Jack the Ripper. I've never read a Jack The Ripper book but I have seen a few documentaries on TV and I'm not convinced at all with Cornwell's conclusion. I think that when she wrote this book, she did so with blinders on. It seems that she was so focused on Sickert that there could be no other possibilities. I don't know that the Ripper identity will ever be solved, and it surely hasn't been with this book."
1,Dull,"I have listened to a lot of Patricia Cornwells books.I could not believed she wrote this one. I have theunabridged version and I was never so disappointed ina book. There have been other books that I didn't carefor but this one drags out to much and is borning.I know a lot about watermarks on paper or handwriting thatI don't think I need to know. Everytime I changed thecassett, I kept thinking it had to get better, but itdidn't. She jumped around so much it was hard to keepup with who she was talking about. I belive the painter is probably the killer. I have read several books on Jackthe Ripper and most of them at least kept my interest,not this one."
2,Case Not Closed,All this book did was convince me that Walter Sickert was a creepy guy. There is no evidence that concretely links Sickert to the Ripper murders. It's a pretty heavy blame to lay on someone without anything more than circumstantial evidence.
4,Not For Everyone,"In this book, America's bestselling crime writer solves the case on Jack the Ripper that has baffled experts for more than a century. Although Patricia Cornwell is an amazing writer, you must have some interest in forensic science and/or crime to read and thoroughly enjoy this book. It's a bit slow-paced at times but the author is just giving you plenty of background information for you to better understand the investigation of Jack the Ripper. She gives you so many details on everything that are conducive to you feeling like you are in the East End of London back in the 19th century. Patricia uses her extensive knowledge of forensic science to present the hard evidence on who the psychopathic killer was, who remained unknown for over a hundred years. With her skills of criminal investigation and as a number-one-bestselling author, Patricia produces an amazing book which is compelling as well as authentic."
2,This book is all over the place,"I just finished reading this book, and while there were some interesting points, it was difficult to read. The author is all over the place in this book. She jumps around in time and the events are hard to follow. Many things described in the book seem to have no relevance to the story. I can't say that she convinced me or didn't convince me. All I can say is that it's possible that she is correct in her enormous claim to have finally cracked the case, but she also may be way off base.I have to add that I think the size of her name on the cover of the book is a little much. Tone down the arrogance, Ms Cornwell."
2,Case not closed,"The major mistake of this book is the arrogance in thinking that century old circumstancial (and controversial) evidence can close any case. Maybe with a little more caution she could have achieved more credibility, but I'm afraid a rash statement such as ""case closed"" doomed this book from the start."
1,BORING!,"I read this book thinking the subject was interesting and expecting the quality of writing Cornwell demonstrated in the earlier Scarpetta novels. Alas, this book was so boring I couldn't even finish it - and I usually finish anything I read. The writing drags and I didn't find the theory very compelling either. Whether you're a fan of Cornwell or interested in The Ripper, you'll be disappointed."
4,Is the case really closed?,"""Overall ""Portrait if a Killer"" was a very interesting and rather compelling. It did however, have parts in it that were rambling, unnecessary and confusing. Personally I would give it a seven out of ten, due to the simple fact that it raised some very well articulated points."""
1,Absolute tosh: says more about Cornwell than Sickert,"I can't think of another character assassination that is as unfounded as this, based as it is on pure conjecture and highly selective and inconclusive 'evidence'.And just think of the irony of a writer who has based her entire written output on lingering over the sordid details of murder and mutilation claiming that Sickert was a violent psychopath because of the subject-matter of his paintings. Talk about the pot calling the kettle black!This book reveals more about the neuroses and obsessions of Cornwell's own sick mind than it does about Sickert. Rather than 'case closed' on Sickert, it is 'case closed' on Cornwell.Cornwell's reputation as a writer of FICTION remains intact."
2,A Reader from Coeur d' Alene Idaho,"I have just managed to get through this book, though it wasn't a noteworthy experience. Cornwell's tone throughout the book suggests grand arrogance and her deductions are based more on supposition than fact. The use of ""may be,"" ""could have been,"" ""quite possibly,"" and a host of other statements of supposition are rampant in the book. To repeatedly refer to Walter Sickert as Jack the Ripper in her unabashed tone--without more concrete evidence--could be potentially liablous. In fact, I would not be surprised if Sickerts family or estate took legal action against Cornwell.Cornwell is obviously out of her league when writing a book of this nature, and she should stick to what she appears to know best: fiction.Bottom line: From the literary point of view, the book drones on in a rambling manner. And, as stated, the facts don't match her conclusions. Don't waste your money."
1,Skip It,"Although at times entertaining, this book was a real chore to plow through. In fact, I found myself skimming the last few chapters just so that it would end quicker. I agree with earlier reviews that call the book disjointed and disorganized. Cornwell makes no effort to put anything in chronological order, which is not necessary if there is another type of organization to take its place. But there isn't. Within each chapter, the information is haphazardly put together; many times a few different topics would occupy the same chapter. I wondered aloud if the editor ever even read the book.All of this really takes away from any that might be interesting. Cornwell's argument is so confusing and has no direction. She never builds up a case. The writing itself is poor and simplistic.That being said, her research has some merit, and I did learn a lot about law enforcement in London in the 1880s. However, I was VERY VERY disappointed."
2,Far from closed,"Cornwell's theories about Walter Sickert, where based on evidence, are reasonable and worth a look if you're a Ripperologist open to considering all theories. If your interest in Jack the Ripper is more passing, you'd do well to pass on this book. Cornwell undermines her case at the start, when she describes her feelings while walking on a city street at night. Her statements that she knew who Jack the Ripper was and that she wasn't wrong, especially as described in such an emotional context as urban fear, outweigh any sense of objectivity in the rest of the book.In the end, Cornwell offers more insistence than evidence that her theory hits the mark, let alone that it closes the case."
2,Well Researched Speculation,"While exhaustively researched, this book makes only a midly compelling case that Sickert is Jack the Ripper. It is extremely long on speculation and forensic detail, and extremely short on deduction or evidence. A great deal of time is spent discussing the Ripper letters and postcards and their watermarks, but there has long been questions about the veracity of most of these documents. At best, Ms. Cornwell paints Sickert as an unlikable individual who may have indeed taunted police for his own perverse pleasure without having anything to do with the actual crimes. After all the hype, I was more or less disappointed in what this book actually delivered."
3,"Interesting theory, case far from closed","All Patricia Cornwall's novel convinced me of was that Walter Sickert was a man quite obsessed with Jack the Ripper. Does that mean he was The Ripper himself? Hardly. His obsession does appear reflected in his art and he may have written a few of The Ripper letters. Again, this does not make him the actual murderer - especially seeing that many of these letters were considered hoaxes. Sickert's seeming obsession with The Ripper isn't all that difficult to understand, given the sensationalism of the crimes and the furor they undoubetly created. The Sickert therory is an interesting one. But that's all it is, a theory based on circumstantial (albeit intriguing) evidence.I also didn't find the book particularly well organized. The chronology of events is choppy and difficult to follow at times. Her concluding chapters are oddly anti-climatic and, in my opinion, unconvincing."
1,Hardly case closed,"I was very disappointed. Patricia Cornwell is a gifted writer and her research was extensive, but she really missed the mark on Jack the Ripper. Most of her points to proove Sickert was the Ripper was reaching at best, sometimes laughable. Don't waste your time."
1,Total Drivel,"This is easily the worst Jack the Ripper volume in existance. Patricia Cornhole has written an unscientific, inaccurate and historically inadaquate book of no importance or redeeming value. After reading this awful blight of a book, we are no closer to solving the identity of Jack the Ripper. In fact we are further away from that elusive goal."
4,Cold Case Investigation at its Best,"If you like the Cold Case show on the A&E channel, you will thoroughly enjoy Patricia Cornwell's evidence on the cold case of Jack the Ripper. But--though she presents very hard circumstantial facts to persuade the reader that artist Walter Sickert was Jack the Ripper, Ms. Cornwell also presents rather lax circumstantial facts relating to other murders that may or may have not been the work of Sickert. This could leave the reader scratching his or her head as to ""why?""All in all, it was a very enjoyable book even though it was on the technical side, but you wouldn't expect anything else from Ms. Cornwell. The circumstantial evidence she discloses is well documented and well versed. It is a shame she was not at the O.J. Simpson trial-the verdict might have been different.I will be glad when Ms. Cornwell gets back to the Scarpetta saga; but in the meantime, I thoroughly enjoyed this current book of her."
2,Entertaining Crime Fiction,"Walter Sickert is Jack the Ripper because of the horrific experience of having his penis amputated by sadistic British nurses in a dirty London hospital. Here is a stunningly terrifying description of what he went through and how it rendered him impotent and with a lifelong need to murder women. By the way there is no actual proof for anything described (though none of his wives or mistresses specifically denied it). Now that we have these facts let us draw some further conclusions to prove his guilt....For example, Jack the Ripper was in a certain borough on a given date and although correspondence indicates that Sickert was out of the country who's to say he wasn't lying?Are you convinced by these arguments? Good. Neither was I. The case is most definitely not closed.Having said that I enjoy Patricia Cornwell's fiction including this book."
2,Not convinced from page one,"Having never read a Ripper book before this one I was not sure what to expect. What I didn't expect was a biased conclusion on who the the Ripper was from almost page one, based on flimsy and circumstantial evidence from the start of the book. The author tried to convince and convict from an early point in her book that Walter Sickert was the murderer of the East End London women who had the musfortune to cross his path in late Victorian London. Evidence is circuital at best and far reaching at the worst; there is not a shred of direct evidence linking Sickert to the crimes he is accused of. If one eliminated the ""could haves"", ""might haves"",""possiblys"" and ""maybes"" this would have cut the book in half; having never read this author before I sincerely hope this is not her best effort."
1,"Poorly edited, poorly written!","Did this book have an editor? It is so jumbled, it's hard to read. In my view, Cornwell MAY have proven that Sickert wrote one or more of the Ripper letters, but does that make him the killer? Otherwise, she seems to read a lot into his ""dark, violent"" art work- so much so that it almost becomes laughable. Does every drawing or painting of a woman really look dead? I don't think so. What Cornwell proves is that Sickert was probably a sicko, but she really stretches and uses a lot of supposition to link him to the kiilings.Aside from all that, the book is just plain poorly written- jumping from subject to subject with a few paragraphs thrown in that have nothing to do with the surrounding text.This comes off as an unworthy vanity work by a successful novelist."
5,Case Presented,"Cornwell has succeeded where too many other Ripper writers have failed -- she has revived mass interest in one of the most notorious murderers in history. Her case is carefully examined and thoughtfully presented in her famous concise style. There is little reason to question her research or the validity of her findings, even if one disagrees with her final conclusions. Perhaps the subtitle, ""Case Closed,"" has engendered a backlash among Ripper experts, but it would be foolish to judge an entire book on one unfortunate term. This is probably the best overall Ripper book penned for sheer writing style alone, and an excellent introduction to the London that produced the monster. David R. Bannon, Ph.D.; author ""Race Against Evil."""
5,Almay anti-Persperant,I have sensitive skin and other anti-persperants make me itch after using them for a few days. Almay does not. I am also sensitive to scents (allergies)and the unscented feature is also a big plus for me. Almay controls perspiration and odor as well as anything I have ever used and my pits are not sticky after applying. Excellent product!
4,I like it,Ginkgo is waaaayyyy better in liquid form. Every college student or busy professional need this in their life. It helps me be alert when I need to do homework
5,Hours and hours of fun...,"This book will point you in the right direction for info on just about any outre topic you can think of. Serial killers, political movements, conspiracy theories, forensic pathology, parapsychology, you name it this book has it. Impress your friends with you new-found esoteric knowledge."
5,mind boggling,I had the third dispatch that arrived in my mail box and I have been hooked on the Amok Dispatches since then. This is the best place to find out about the astounding collection of books that you did not existed. Not a catalog that you want in young hands but a play ground for adults. Bizzare books on almost any topic that you can think of. Great fun.... surprising how many of the books listed that I must own ... someday.
5,Flabbergasting! Shocking! Tawdry! Informative!,"I had long since given up on hoping for a fifth dispatch-- I'd worn out the first four (and ordered dozens of books from them) in the 80s and 90s. Then-- bliss!-- this arrived. A volume of hundreds of pages of out-of-the-ordinary (some of it extremely so) literature and info is something you'll like. Obsessively readable and packed with minutiae, it's something to keep by the bedside for weeks of close reading (though don't let the kiddies too close). It's a little like an internet on paper, wandering off in all directions, most of them fascinating. Buy and read-- worth the money."
2,Not a fan,"Reviewed coco-mango lotion & dislike the butter version for same reason - scent. Too strong for me. Not overpowering. Just that I am one who only likes very, very light, subtle scents on myself. If you like the scent of the lotion, this butter would be great. It makes skin feel so nice & soft, is thick but absorbs nicely."
3,Ampersand is a great addition to your IZZ collection,"I've been waiting quite a while to get this one. It's a great addition to Sliver and I Move, but it doesn't stand alone. Ancient Memories starts off like a CSN tune, with tight vocal harmonies and acoustic guitars, but evolves into a great prog track with an awesome keyboard solo by Tom Galgano. Confusion is one of the strongest tracks and also features wonderful harmonies. Paul Bremner has a solo acoustic jazzy piece which I found to be wonderfully done, but out of place. Laura Meade takes the lead, voice and piano, on My Best Defenses, another beautiful piece that seems out of place.Buy ""I Move"" and ""Sliver of the Sun"" first, then Ampersand. IZZ: The FUTURE OF PROG."
2,Izz this Izz?,This is truly a disappointing release - nothing at all like the first two releases for at least the first nine tunes. What a shame! They seem to have lost most of the adventurousness that made them unique.
5,Monster rancher playstation,My husband and I enjoyed this game when we were younger so we glad to find it and share it with our daughter. She loves the pixies.
3,S'up Game got EXTREMELY boring,"S'upThis game was fun at the beginning, with leveling up your monster, seeing how strong he can get, who he/she can beat, how old the monster can get. But after about 10 years monster time the thing you raised so hard mostly dies. So you have to start over and do everything again. After my first monster died the game got real stupid real quick. So rent the game a couple of times then if you like buy it if you don't join the club."
4,"Monster, Monster","This game is real fun, if you liked the giga pets you'll like this . It's all almost in polygonal graphics, you get to fight and mix your monsters up its a easy game to master you should injoy it it is almost like a pokemon thing just for playstion.This game is very exciting and fun, one of my favorite monsters is Tiger he is fast and blue . This game is very addicting, once you play it once you'll wont to play it more, and more.I hope this is alittle helpful."
1,Among the WORST,"I wish I could have given this book less than one star. It is, without question, one of the worst written books I have come across. A ragtag of charts, quotes, terms and dictionary definitions without any concept development. I don't think one could learn ANYTHING from this book. It's like reading someones ""cram"" notes to lectures one never attended. I think the editor needs a new line of work, and that the publisher should be ashamed."
2,Now on DVD--sort of,"Yes, it appears this is now available on DVD at PBS--but only to insitutions, and at the staggering price of $200. It would be great if this coudl be sold to individuals at a more reasonable price."

2,Room for improvement (corners),"I was not able to used this at my house because it would not let me close the cabinet's door. the corners need to be in a 45 degree angle, or something because the way it is you will need a bigger than mine 14"" cabinet door."
5,Tremendous!!!,"I have been on blood pressure medication for over 15 years. I was first diagnosed with high BP when I was 24. I tried most of the BP medications and hated all of them. I had significant fatigue and lethargy with all of them. I read this book and took the recommendations with respect to a high potassium diet (high K factor). To make a long story short, I have been able to reduce the medication by 2/3. Realize that switching to this diet is not easy. But for me it was, as anything I felt would be better than continuing to take the toxic BP medication. I anticipate that I will be able to completely get off of them soon."
5,"Well documented, easy-to-follow advice","If you're looking for a practical guide to lowering blood pressure, this book is for you. Sensible with easy-to-understand language, this book gives reasons for high blood pressure, tips that will probably help most people, and specific guidelines including sample diets, that are scientifcally proven to work. Probably the best book I've read on the topic. Recommended."
3,Mostly information that I already I knew,Some parts of the book were useful but it seemed rather out of date as our understanding of what makes the body work best has changed so much since 1994 and this was especially true as I had just read the book 'vit.K2 and the Calcium Paradox' and I found that book prehaps the most valuable book on nutrition that I had read for years and am having great success with the understandings I got from that book so this one was disappointing.
4,Very Pleased,"Me being a huge Jean Grey fan, I was excited to see her being resurrected for a mini series. Though, resurrection is a very touchy subject, it was pulled off nicely. Even though the storyline was a bit off, the artwork was amazing. I could go on forever about it. Each page was drawn with equisite detail, every character had so much attitude. I was almost suprised they didn't pop off the pages. All in all, this is an excellent buy for any Jean fans."
2,X-Men :Phoenix endsong is okay but not very good.,"X-Men:Phoenix endsong is okay but it's not very good. The book by Greg Pack and Greg Land does not deliver the same feel you felt when reading X-Men: The Dark Phoenix Saga. Chris Claremont and John Bryne understood the Jean/Grey Phoenix storyline better. The triumph and the tragedy of Jean Grey is beter explored in Chris Claremont's X-Men comics. Greg Pack and Greg land was maybe hired by Marvel comics to make money of the X-Men/Pheonix storyline. How many times did Jean Grey have to die? Please let Jean Grey rest in peace and give her a real conclusion to her story. Between X-Men: Endsong and X-Men:Dark Phoenix Saga, I recommend X-Men:The Dark Phoenix Saga. I will admit Greg Land's art is beautiful but I think his photo-realistic style on the X-Men doesn't have the same feelings as John Byrne's artwork. C-"
2,Bland Story with Nice Art,"So, there's yet another Phoenix story. This one is incredibly bland, with lame dialog, whiney new characters I don't recognize (Quentin), and a cliche ending. The only saving grace is Wolverine's interactions with Jean, and the art. From what I've gathered, the artist is known for drawing attractive women characters. I'd have to agree, but it's not enough to save this tpb. Easily skippable."
2,Not Specifically About Short Films,"While the subtitle of this book is accurate (""structure and content for screenwriters""), the main title is incredibly misleading. While many short films are used as examples, I can sum up what the book says about writing the short screenplay with: They must be focused, because they are short.The information in the book about writing a story for film is informative and worthwhile, and could be applied to any form of storytelling. But, as I was looking for specific information about working in a short screenplay format, I found that this book has very little to offer on the subject.4 stars as a book on story structure0 stars as a book about writing short films"
5,So Fresh!,"Gorgeous, fresh, and sophisticated versions of some of the best songs of our time. Deborah Latz is wonderful!"
5,Truly A Miracle Story!,"Mike Henle has written an eloquent account of his miracle cure from epilepsy! This was very moving, and his ordeal ended only after he sought answers from the brilliant doctors at Scripps Hospital. This book will give hope to millions with a seizure disorder, like me.

3,Like a Train Wreck That Keeps on Wrecking,"I am sure there is method to this madness sonewhere, but I am yet to find it. Perhaps I am not looking hard enough. Perhaps I have looked too hard? Perhaps I just need to get distance from this recording and tackle it again, from a bit lower down.Certainly more in the ""Disco Volante"" or ""Songs for Adult Voice"" catagory than some of the other Zorn/Patton/Spruance collabarations, this cd is quite hard to listen to. It ain't dinner music. If you like the totally odd noise caper, then this is for you. I don't mind it myself, but sometimes you just want to sing! And you can't do that here, but worthy of a review none the less."
1,Huge waste of money,"It [isn't good]. Period. Even hardcore fans of Zorn, Patton, Spruance, etc. will be disappointed. Buy groceries instead."
1,weird little boy blows,"I payed $23 for this CD, because it's a a rare import, and because I had never heard it. It's not music at all - it's mostly just strange sounds and ambience. DO NOT BUT THIS CD! It's worthless. Trey Spruance (who is on the CD) actually apologizes to any of his fans who have bought it. (check out wikipedia)"
2,Weird Little Boy,"Not expecting much going into this CD,I came away with very little.I'm not even sure this CD sould be considered ""music"",it has more of an ambiant sound to it.If you have an interest in listening to this group because of the infamous vocalist from FNM/Mr.Bungle Mike Patton,you will find yourself scratching your head trying to figure out why he was even included in this group,there is basically no hint of his vocals on this at all.This seems more along the lines of John Zorn without any of his usual musical blustering.In short unless you are in the mood to listen strange,ambiant noises with little music and even less vocals,this will be a waste of your time."
3,This is good even for those not into religious books.,"I remember leafing through this book on a rack at the grocery store as a child while my mother went about our shopping. What drew me to it was the cute cartoon illustrations, but there is a lot of wisdom in it. The author writes candidly about the major frustrations that only someone who has had a leg in a cast would experience. I never have been in one, but I was drawn to it anyway. It's a little heavy on the faith aspect of it, but the author is so genuine you just go with it. (Those prayer-y parts are easy to read around too, but I didn't mind reading some of them.) It makes me wonder what has happened in the U.S. With all the anti-gay rhetoric that's permeating religious literature today, I wish more books were like this 1978 paperback!"
1,Terrible Interference from your cell phones!,These speakers are so bad! We have had them for about 2 months now and they always have that grating interference/popping sound whenever we have a cell phone in the room. We have a 2nd computer with speakers nearby that never makes so much as a peep when cell phones are near it. Do not buy these! Invest a little bit more for ones with better shielding!!
4,Good cheap sound,"These are super-cheap speakers, and they do exactly what they're supposed to do - provide basic sound for a rock-bottom price. If you're looking for high-quality you're in the wrong place."
1,There is a background sound TOO BAD,Do not buy this item. There is too high noise in the background. I do not recommend it to any one.

5,"Diver down, thumbs up!","Great product, great price, fast ship! Big dive flag, kinda thin material but should hold up for quite some time, has grommets, and for $4.85 + free ship, it's unbeatable."
2,Ok,This is a 3x5 dive flag but it's made a lil cheap. You can see through she red and white. Looks like a dive flag made out of a silk shirt.You get what you pay for. If you looking for a heavy duty dive flag keep looking. If you looking for one to hang in the garage this will work. Bought it to fly on the boats VHF antenna while we are diving. I'm hoping it last 6months.
5,Best Algebra review on market,These books are easy for my 13 year old to use and have plenty of repetition to solidify his understanding of the concepts.

1,The Great Queen Seondoek Vol.III,"It's very bad.Only the delivery was good but all the rests were quite bad.Disc-2 and Disc-4 cannot be played back caused by errors.Other Discs have also small erros by which a short periodvideo freezing happens.One more thing should be noted that I bought Vol.2and enjoyed its error free condition and good videoquality but at Vol.III each Disc contains 5 episodesconsequently the quality is bad, whilst at Vol.2each Disc contains 3 episodes and provides good videoquality.Seller, Please refund."
1,You get what you pay for. Not.,"Worst electric shaver in my life (I've owned three in 40 years.) It sounded like an unbelievable bargain, coming from Bell & Howell. And ""unbelievable"" it was. Can't believe they put their name on it. Cheap construction, useless shave. It took longer than shaving with lather and razor -- and STILL didn't get everything. Irritated skin through repeated attempts to get a decent shave on any given area of face. Screen broke after just over 90 days of trying to use it -- thus blocking the rotary ""blades"" from rotating. I threw the thing away yesterday. Save your $20 and put it toward a Norelco, if it's rotoray you want. Personally, after this experience, I've gone back to blades and lather. Faster, cleaner, no irritation, great shave -- and cheaper. I feel like a fool for having believed the ubiquitous TV ads for the Tri-Tek."
1,Waste of money for Police Collectors,"If you collect police call boxes this book is useless. It has about 5 pages of police related info in the book. If you collect fire stuff it looks like a good book. He needs to take ""police telegraph"" out of the title."
3,"Do not buy this version, get the newest one","This 7.0 has bugs and will not work with newer library servers. I only purchased it because I was promised the $100 upgrade free when I bought. The latest version is worth the expense if you a student. Learn the program early and use it for taking notes on readings.I also recommend that you print annotated references often, because my computer fried and when I reinstalled the program (never version?) it did not reassemble the files. I lost EVERYTHING becuase I could not reassemble all the files."
5,A Must Have for Your Collection!,"Having only been familiar with James Plotkin from the ""Collapse"" CD he did with Mick Harris, I wasn't quite sure what to expect from this disc. However, by about half-way through the second track, ""Hung on a Line"", I knew I had stumbled upon something quite amazing. The blending and processing of Ruth Collin's voice with Plotkin's guitar loops create an eerie, yet beautiful sound that I have yet to hear in anything else. This record, although somewhat eclectic at times, has an almost gothic and much more etherial feel than most experimental and ambient types of music that I have heard. Highly recommended to any James Plotkin fans and anybody else interested in highly innovative and experimental guitar based music."
3,Doesn't hit hard enough,"I found this entire CD lacking the one element to make any song a real classic. Maybe I just need my funk dirtier than this, but, not one song on this album has me out of my chair, and onto the floor. All build up, and little delivery."
4,DC's Best Go-Go,"As a native Washingtonian, I feel this greatest hits cd captures the essence of the Nation's Capital. This is a geniune article and should be purchased only by true go-go lovers. Our musical style can not be duplicated. Enjoy this flash from the not-so- distant past. A must have cd."

4,Hodel's book is a good undergraduate textbook.,"The level of rigor is just right for undergraduates in mathematics, philosophy and computer science. It covers most of the basic concepts and provides careful proofs for most of the major theorems. It would be nice to add chapters on modal logic and program verification. Computer science students can benefit from such discussions."
1,"Worthless, Slow, Boring, and STUIPID!","I've never wanted to kick myself harder than I did while watching this movie. After reading some positive feedback about the film I was very interested to see what it was about. The Rob Zombie look alike should've been my first clue that watching this movie was going to be a truly painful experience. The story took way to long to start going somewhere, and the make up was just CHEAP! I won't even go into how bad the actors were. Just do yourself a favor and AVOID THIS MOVIE! PERIOD!"
1,God Awful,"This movie is terrible. It was so terrible in fact that I just threw it out after I bought it. I could not sleep at night knowing that such a piece of crap was part of my dvd collection. I didn't return it, and I didn't try to sell it used for fear that someone else would have to sit through it. Absolutely awful.Crappy, two dollar production, the worst special effects I have ever seen and a story that reminds one of Nickelodeon's ""Are You Afraid of the Dark."" So bad. So so so so so so so bad. I cannot believe that Chas Balun (of Deep Red fame) gave this a positive review. His opinion value just went down about a million points. No seriously, this movie sucks.No really.Awful."
3,Putting an inventive twist on an old concept.,"This movie is by far, one of the most entertaining and inventive zombie movies to be released in the last few years. Fans of the genre will definetly get a kick out of this one. Simply put, It's about a small group of film makers who unwittingly open a gate to the netherworld while filming their movie (oops!). I was unimpressed with the ending, though. That's why I only gave it 3 stars. But check this movie out if you enjoy the simple pleasures of kicking back and watching stereotypical characters getting killed in a variety of ways. I know I do."
1,Zer00000 Stars.,"I dont know what to say but I simply brought it because on the cover it says "" an interesting movie "" or sometihimg like that and that comment was made by Tom Savini. I took a shot and was completely disapointed. It cost $10 and sold it for $8 the next night. I think that should say plenty about it. The acting sucks the story line is ok but if done with a higher budget better effects, better acting and a better director could be a good movie and with more gore would be good. But to buy this movie as it is its not worth it at all. Its not scary infact quit silly and retarded and the whole time has you saying what the hell is going on here. Basically please dont waste any money on this flick take your money and put towards a good living dead flick like Dawn Of The Dead, or Zombi- By Lucio fulci, or Dead Alive. You get my point, buy a movie that you will keep and watch over and over because""the dead hate the living"" you will not."
1,I WANT MY HOUR AND A HALF BACK!!! TERRIBLE!!!,"Truly an awful movie. The story is all set-up and character development for the first 45 minutes. Once you get to the horror part of the movie, you're so bored and disinterested you don't care. The directing, acting and editing is really subpar. Save your money. Buy Romero's 1978 DAWN OF THE DEAD DVD re-release instead."
1,...and the living hate this movie.,"Garbage. This movie is complete garbage. Nothing to see here, and this is from someone who loves a wide variety of horror movies. Instead of wasting any time watching this movie, go rent 'The Video Dead' or something else that's at least ""funny"", perhaps, in it's awfulness.Absolutely terrible."
1,"Don't be fooled, this movie stinks.","I've produced better looking things in my toilet. The acting is very poor, the effects are awful. (The cartoon like fire on the zombies) It plays out like a Rob Zombie video, and has all the charm too. I know it's a low budget horror, but in comparison to movies of this ilk, it still fails to even slightly entertain. If you feel compelled to watch this movie because of the zombie on the cover, trust me, you'll regret it."
4,FULL MOON DOES IT AGAIN,I just watched the DVD and it was one of the best horror movies I've seen in a long time. I really liked the storyline in this film. There are some really cool scenes in here. If you're looking for something a little out of the ordinary then this is the movie to get. The ending left it open for a sequel or two. I read about this movie in Fangoria and they said it was a must see and they were right again! Can't wait for more.
1,This movie is a waste of my beer guzzling time,This movie goes well beyond where no one would go. Its boundries crossed tatared with the light of other films. This waste of film video is scene by scene and word for word ripped out of almost every horror film in existence. It is the blackend botton of a pit in dispair. It not only makes jokes about some of horrors greatests influences it is an utter self shutter of human perversions.
1,What a piece of s***,"This has to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. These people had some money for some special effects, but none for talent.Just to give you an idea of how bad this flick is: The story is these kids are trying to shoot their own horror movie in this abandoned hospital or whatever it is..... so they have some props for thir movie..... one of which is a fake-looking cemetery made of styrofoam and wood and crap.... okay, so they run into the main bad guy who is a cheap Rob-Zombie ripoff, and he summons up the zombies in this film...... FROM THE PROP GRAVEYARD THE FILM STUDENTS HAD BUILT!!! And we're supposed to not notice this!?!?! That this was never supposed to be a real cemetery but now the main bad guy can summon the living dead from it??This movie is as bad as the 2003 flick House of the Dead..... maybe worse. It's a real brown sewer nugget."
2,Just fast-forward past everything without Topaz,"Where have you gone, Jamie Donahue? Our nation turns it's lonely eyes to you.Woo-woo-woo..."
2,Horrible But The Zombies Looked Perfect,"This movie was boring to me, people all said it to be scary. The zombies looked nice but were not scary at all. The whole movie made no sense. Don't get this."
2,Full Moon Picture's Scores Again...,"This movie has got to be one of the worst horror/zombie movies I have ever seen, and trust me I have seen many bad ones. It doesn't even have an interesting plot; the highlight of the movie is that annoying theme song at the end aptly titled ""Dead Hate the Living"". The twist ending was its only saving quality. For some reason all of the Full Moon Pictures I have seen (although the company seems promising because they have so many horror titles) are horrible. The only one that I would say is worse is Redneck Zombies... If you are one of those people who like to say you have seen all the horror movies you can find, watch it. Otherwise, don't waste your time."
5,The True Cult Classic...,"This zombie flick is one of the third greatest cult classic film since (THE EVIL DEAD TRILOGY) and (DEAD ALIVE), its one of Dave Parker's first film, and its low-budget because of the special effect I love the way the bad guy looks alot like (Rob Zombie), the bomper sticker that has a name of the director who made (ZOMBIE), and one of the character who said (What would Bruce Campbell do?). If you like zombie film, you love this one.10 out of 10"
2,The dead hate the living and we hate the dead,"Hm. Okay,if you like films that are so self-referential, then you will love this. Everything from Fulci, to Argento, is mentioned in the ""clever and witty"" dialogue.But, if like me, you want to see something original, then it would be best to give this a wide birth.References to other films does not make this film good.I truly felt bored watching this and just wanted the whole thing to finally end.If you want a decent Zombie flick, then go out and buy DAWN OF THE DEAD or ZOMBIE by Lucio Fulci."
5,Ironic...,"...that one of the most complete and definitive special edition dvds I've come across is for a low-budget Full Moon horror movie. This dvd has everything: production art, photos, a making-of featurette, outtakes, cast retrospectives, a music video, a trailer, and a commentary with the director and the cast. And the biggest shock: it's a great movie! Well, perhaps those who aren't die-hard Italian horror fans won't like it as much, but I am a die-hard Italian horror fan, and I loved it. Great script, clever dialogue, appealing actors, killer low-budget make-up and effects (the cgi shots are cheese defined, but they work), and a surpringly well-composed score (along with a few fun punk songs). So what are you waiting for? it's loaded with features, and it's a killer horror film.Highly recommended for horror fans."
1,What were they thinking?,"I purchased this movie with the hopes of finding a diamond in the rough. A gem of a movie that would keep my interest even if it is a ""B"" horror film. That was not the case. This is a ""C"" movie at best. Throughout the movie they make small references to others who have influenced the zombie industry but this movie really sucks! It isn't even worth the $8.99 I paid for it. I should get my money back. A group of 6th graders could put on a better production. I went into this movie very optimistic and with my eyes wide open but at the end I just wanted to close my eyes and forget about it. I read others reviews and purchased it based off of the reviews. Trust me...don't buy it. I have seen a lot of bad films and this one ranks right up there. If you are in the mood to lose a few brain cells them rent this one...don't buy it."
3,"Not great, but not to bad either.","This was a surprisingly decent B movie. The effects pretty much sucked, but the zombie makeup was actually a lot better then I was expecting. Over all it almost seemed a bit of a spoof on zombie flicks, and was rather enjoyable. Can't say I'd look to buy it, but is worth seeing."
2,MEDIOCRITY PERSONIFIED,"Enjoyable in it's own tired way, there is very little in this film to either love or hate. Renting this particular flick would be more fiscally practical than buying it, as you certainly wouldn't wear it out watching it over & over again."
4,"Low budget is clear in this movie ,but well done!","Depending wheather you are a horror fan or not will be if you like this film or not. It shows it is low-budget and corny ,but I think it was good for the budget. I would compare this the The Convent in which it is better if you watch it more then twice to really like it. I like it..."
5,Nice Debut,"A folk group, which calls Winnipeg, Manitoba home. Nice blend of songs, beautiful arrangements. Of particular note is the cover of Niel Youngs song ""Old Man."" Worth the price for any folk music fan."
5,Great all around!,"I bought this for the song ""One Voice"", but have fallen in love with the rest of the ""album""! Incredible harmony's!"
3,CD skips,"Enjoyed the music but 2 songs on the disc skip. I guess thats what you get when you buy used. Not happy with that part of the purchase, everything else was o.k. I guess."
4,The Wailin Jennys,"Really beautiful harmonies. Some of the songs will bring tears to you eye. Ruth Moody and Nicky Mehta have written some beautiful songs, and the traditional pieces are wonderful. I'm sorry, but the Cara Luft pieces don't go down quite as well as the rest of the album.Overall just beautiful. Hope to here more from them."
3,A Magical Blending of Voices,"Wonderful harmonies. These singers harmonize in an almost magical blending of their voices. However, I was disappointed that there was only one a cappella track on the CD. Every time I've heard them on the radio, they've performed mostly a cappella selections which are absolutely beautiful."
4,Canadian treasure,"I had never heard of the Wailin' Jennies until I attended a live Prairie Home Companion performance this summer, and everyone I spoke to afterwards were.like me, blown away by this trio. Their crystalline voices and tight harmonies are a treat for the ears. So I ordered their first CD, which is also a pleasure. I'll be ordering their second soon, and looking forward to their next, which will include their incredible performance of ""Calling All Angels""."
5,"A Fantastic CD from My New ""Favorite Group""","Probably like many new fans of The Wailin' Jennys, I discovered them on a recent broadcast of A Prairie Home Companion. After finding their website, and also discovering that I could purchase their CD ""40 Days"" on iTunes, I have become a true Jennys fanatic. And heck, I'm a 54 year old MAN. So why do I like them? Great original songs - and arrangements of older songs - performed beautifully. I have become a particular fan of Jenny's soprano Ruth Moody and her songwriting. ""One Voice"", ""Beautiful Dawn"" and ""Heaven When We're Home"" are as representative of great country/folk songwriting as ANYTHING coming out of Nashville. And Ruth's voice is remarkable.All in all, The Wailin' Jennys deserve to be one of the future best-selling acts in music today. Check out their songs here at Amazon or on iTunes, and discover for yourself this remarkable group."
5,Clarification on MIDI File Save,"I hope this will be a helpful clarification to P.M. Feldman's comment that DGX-620B saves only to proprietary non-MIDI format, which I believe is not fully correct. Page 94 of the User's Manual (available free online from yamaha) describes how to Convert a user song to SMF (Standard MIDI File) format and save to a USB flash drive. In this way it is possible to compose your own song with multiple voices, and save it to to MIDI format for use on a computer or other MIDI devices (and this applies to the 520 620 525 625 models, and similar function is available on the DGX 505 as well). I hope this helps!"
5,Excellent,"This book, unlike many others, goes into extensive detail regarding dart manipulation. I have been able to re create the intricate designs of the 30's 40's and 50's where dart manipulation was the essence of the garment. It is complex but not so much so that the average dressmaker cant use it. It is written in a tutorial type format, with reduced scale pattern blocks to practice with. All in all, the best book I have got in my large collection."
5,An excellent book on all types of patternmaking.,This is an excellent book on all types of patternmaking. I use it all the time for drafting and altering patterns. The illustrations are simple and easy to follow. It has been a valuable resource for patternmaking.
2,Skip this one,"Boy I had high hopes for this one. Coming off their best album, Shot, and produced by Gang of Four's Andy Gill, I was expecting a masterpiece. The opening track isn't half bad, but the rest is throw-away. Doesn't even sound like Jesus Lizard. Go get Down or Shot instead."
4,"Small book, powerful message","I picked up this little red book knowing nothing about DeAnglelis and too little about some of my own confusing emotions and experiences. Perhaps its brevity and simple truths are part of its power and charm. Don't expect an intellectual masterpiece but it's well worth the hour it will take to read. If you are passionate, you will love it and laugh with DeAngelis. If you lack passion, it could open your eyes to a new truth."
3,Casio DR-210,"The provider sent another model calculator without advising me first. I preferred the model I ordered due to visual problems and the one I ordered was a lighter color, but the one they sent had more features (which I do not need) and was all 'black'. It would have been more acceptable for the supplier to advise of the substitution prior to sending since they probably were not aware of my visual problem."
5,this is how I feel,Wen I was little I thoght this barney book was a lot more fun than a lot of other barney books. I really liked to go to the zoo and loved some big animals and I filt like barney got to go to the zoo a lot and it made me happy to see barney going to the zoo about 0 or 1 and somtimes a lot more in only a 24 hour a day.
5,A wonderful tale about the true sense of friendship,"This book is a pure miracle ! I've read it in french. (Amazing ! For one time, the french translation is released before the english edition!) I bought the book as a gift for a four-years-old girl but after I read it with her I went back to the bookstore to buy my own copy. The text is simple and speaks to both heart and soul. I had never read such a good and masterful description of friendship. And what a gifted illustrator Chris Riddell is ! Last but surely not least : you don't need to be a child to appreciate the tale, I testify and I swear !"
5,Heavenly Voices That Will Inspire You!,"A friend of mine heard me singing a certain song on this CD one day and she asked me if I liked the song and I replied yes. I told her that a girl in my church choir sang the song and she (my friend), let me borrow the cassette. I was so amazed at the power of the Clark Sisters (especially Twinkie) and how they made you feel as though you were really in a church setting! The Florida A&M Choir delivered power, grace and style on this ablum as well. My favorites are ""I Won't Complain, Complete the Work, and Coming Again So Soon"". If you are planning on buying this CD, I can assure you that you will not be disappointed. I still have the cassette and I am going to purchase the CD through Amazon.com. I believe that God has blessed these individuals with very special talents to touch and inspire others in their daily Christian walk!"
1,Twinkie Clark,"I buy alot of items from Amazon because of it's wide selection and quality however, this particular item was a disappointment for me because the seller was dishonest. They sent me the CD Jacket with a totally different CD inside. I have definitely lost confidence is making Amazon purchases."
5,A Blessing,"The cd is an inspiration. I am a big fan of the Clark Sisters, as well as an Alumni member of the FAMU Gospel Choir."
4,Mind Wars,"Mind Wars""War of Wits: The Anatomy of Espionage and Intelligence"" by Ladislas Farago who served as Chief of research and Planning of the Navy's Special Warfare Branch during World War Two, presents an excellent discussion of his experiences. The book provides ample attention to intelligence, counter-intelligence and psychological warfare. The author delivers a very interesting presentation of early special operations during World War II."
4,You will be happy,"Once again if you like M.C. Beatons books its another great one, really great to read the whole series; although it is a series you could just read a book as they are a complete story to themselves. Nice easy light happy reading - don't have to think and as usual you know it all works out well. Although you will get an insite to the ways of the world during Regency England. These books are lovely to have on hand if you need to de-stress or after a heavy going book or book series."
3,Ok but fat,"The item works fine, plug and play, but you loose the usb port right next,above or under where you plug it in due to it is too fat."
2,Unhappy Mac user.,"Apparently this is only for PC users b/c it is doing nothing for my Mac & its 2.16 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo processor. My computer cannot recognize the Micro Innovations keyboard I attached to it. Granted, the keyboard is old, but that's what I bought this adapter for! I like the clickety-clack of old keyboards, makes me feel productive."
2,FATTY adapter.,"It works. (Will not work for any mice I've tried, just in case anyone was wondering if it swings both ways)The reason this lost 3 stars is that this is a very fat adapter; both width and height. There's no reason it should be this fat as it is entirely unusable on either of my desktop machines due to how close USB ports are grouped together. On both machines it covers 4, yes 4, USB ports no matter which position they are plugged in. It's so wide and tall that the only thing I've managed to plug in in a port diagonal from it was a wired USB plug for a mouse, but then actually still bends the PS2 adapter.This works on my laptop but in that case if I want to use it I can't plug in headphones since it covers the headphone jack. =/"
5,Perfect for old keyboards,"I really like to use my old Keytronic keyboards that have PS2 plugs. This works perfect with a new Dell Windows 7 box, converting to USB. Well worth the few extra bucks to know it works!"
4,PS2 to UBS adaptor,"I purchased a new computer but hated the new keyboard. I first purchased one of those inexpensive [...] adapters which did not work. Don't waste your time with those they merely make the end of your PS2 look like a USB but don't work...at least not with my 6 year old HP keyboard and also wouldn't work with my optical mouse. This one works! I've got my old keyboard back and love it.I've taken away one star only because the adapter is a little large and like another poster noted might interefere with other USB or other input that is nearby. My new computer had plenty of USB connections so no problem. Also as suggested if USB ports are in short supply and you might lose one due to this adapters size you could buy a small USB to USB adapter to keep this adapter's larger size away from an adjacent USB or other port.In summary, this one works! Delivered in a reasonable time and recommended."
5,Works great,"Does exactly what it is supposed to do.Warning: DO NOT buy the cheap $1-2 ones, they DO NOT WORK"
4,Awesome little device,"Works nicely with an old IBM ""Model M"" - the LED's seem just a slight bit dim, but otherwise perfectly functional.As others have mentioned, it's a boxy little thing, so you may wish to consider a short USB extension. I have an extender laying around somewhere which I plan to use. Otherwise, it will cover an available port.Allows for the old Model M (and other PS/2 keyboards) to work in a modern era.Perfect, except for the awkward shape of the little adapter, and possibly slightly less than perfect amount of current.Have not yet tried any ""gaming"" type key combos, but I don't see why it wouldn't work.I'm betting that most users of an ""old fashioned"" keyboard are more interested in typing, for which this adapter works great!"
5,PS2 - USB Adapter.,"Tried the generic PS2 - USB adapters and they didn't work on my favorite IBM PS/2 keyboard,#1391401 model M, circa mid 80's. This adapter worked like a charm the first time I plugged it in."
2,"Right church, wrong pew","This the 2nd PS/2 to USB adapter that I have tried. I reviewed the other one elsewhere as workable when used with a PS/2 mouse but a failure when used with a keyboard due to missing electronics. With this adapter the electronics are there, so the adapter does function as described.But there are three things to factor into an adapter use-decision: form, fit, and function. The function is present, but the large form of the adapter makes for a suboptimal fit. The adapter takes up the plug space needed for TWO USB devices when plugged to the backplane of a DELL PC.Options to this: add a USB extention cord to get the adapter away from the PC, or get a 4-plug USB port. Just watch out for the total wattage that all these adapters are pulling from the PC power supply, which will drag down the overall system."
5,Perfect for IBM Model M 1391401 Keyboards,"This converter works like a charm! It's actually not an adapter- a converter has the circuitry to make the PS/2 signal into a USB signal; an adapter is passive. So, this won't work with a PS/2 mouse. But, it does work for all three of my IBM Model M keyboards! This converter made 'em work on my newer desktop, on any of the laptops I've tried, and even when attached to my Nintendo Wii (which was pretty great).This is also the adapter recommended for the Model M by [...]. I'm using it to type with my Model M on my laptop right now! This is an excellent buy, for sure."
5,Original IBM PC-AT Keboard to USB,This is the ONLY PS2 KB2USB that work for me as I have been desperate to get my vintage PC-AT Keyboard to work with my top of the line system.
4,Works as expected,The unit is a little large and I'll probably end up using it while plugged into a corded USB hub. I was using it on a Lenovo laptop and it blocks both side ports. It arrived on time and worked flawlessly.
2,not for all computers,"this didn't work for me, tried connecting a ps2 gateway keyboard to a usb connector on a Dell. That was OK, but I was unaware I would need to search all over for a driver to match my keyboard. Needless to say, I never found one and wound up ordering a new keyboard. Would have sent this back if shipping was free."
1,Effectively did not work,"The reviews here of this product suggested that it would work for older keyboards where simple passive adapters would not. The adapter is indeed the ""active"" type I needed for my old keyboard, but it worked horribly, unfortunately. It would not handle more than about two keystrokes per second without beginning to lag severely (so that I would have to wait 10 seconds or more for my keystrokes to be sent to the computer), and it would intermittently drop a keystroke or replace a keystroke with the wrong key! It might be that the individual adapter I received was defective, and not that the adapter is of poor design, but I decided not to go through the hassle of shipping tiny pieces of plastic back and forth over large distances to settle the question."
4,Works with IBM Model M,"This adapter works great with an IBM Model M keyboard. In fact, I'm using a Model M on my Macbook to type this review! The only issue is that the adapter is sort of fat and blocks other USB ports if you have a computer with USB ports close together. You can fix this problem by picking up a short USB extension cable. The one I got should be on this page under what other customers bought with it."
4,Works for IBM Model M,"The adapters work flawlessly with my IBM Modem M keyboard.A few drawbacks - the adapter is a little wide making adjacent USB ports hard to access. Of course, easily fixed with a simple USB extension.Also the plug is a a little loose and if you have a heavy plug like the Model M does, it does get bent a little after a while from the weight. Still works though!"
3,BIG.....but works ok.,"The unit works ok, it is just a ""space hog"". It blocks the USB ports both above & below it. Italso blocks ports to either side of it, a standard USB plug will not connect to the ports mentioned."
4,PS2 to USB Adapter Just Works,"This little PS2 to USB adapter worked right out of the box. I just plugged it into a USB Slot on our Windows XP Pro PC, connected our old PS2 Keyboard to it and the keyboard was recognized right away. I gave it four stars because I thought it too expensive. Functionally it doesn't get any easier."
5,The Only PS2 to USB keyboard adapter to Buy,"I too have an new computer but have the old PS2 keyboard. I like the old big keys on HP or Dell. I purchased the standard adapter at a local computer store. But to no avail, it did not work. So I go online to find out why. I could not find an answer for the problem until I read the reviews for this adapter. I purchased this one from Ziotek direct for $10.00 as they are now unavailable on Amazon. It worked as soon as I installed it. Don't buy cheap adapters or you will waste your money."
1,doesn't keep up with typing,"I got this to hook up my old sgi 101 keyboard to my netbook. I don't type incredibly fast but this thing drops characters and is virtually unusable for me at least. I haven't tried any other adapters which are powered, I hear they may work better."
4,Good product,"Product works as described. However if you plan on using a splitter and having it work for both a keyboard and mouse, it doe not support a mouse."
5,Great Product,"Considering the price, this is a great product. The quality of the gloves is very good and better than any of the other ones that I have used. I highly recommend buying these gloves!"
5,I love my gloves,They came in a timely manner and feel great on my hands. Amazon you are awesome as usual. They are well made and make my workouts enjoyable.
1,yoga gloves :),"first of all this review is based on my personal experience and that may vary with you.i weight lift as a hobby , but i do it hard and i enjoy it, i bought these gloves to try a different brand than my regulars, i have been using them for a week or so, and there is already multiple tears and the Velcro stitching is already broke , the gloves stains your hands ( fake colors), i never had a weight lifting gloves that fails this fast . and i have been weight lifting for 16 years or more.BOTTOM LINE : FOR WEIGHT LIFTING THEY ARE VERY POORLY MADE, AND VERY FRAGILE. IF YOU WANT THEM FOR HARD CORE YOGA TRAINING THEN GO AHEAD.design : ok , but very poor qualitycolors : fake , they stain your hands and that is never goodquality : very poor even if compared to any store generic brands.fit : 1 to 1 sizefeel : oksupport: wrist support is below averagewould i recommend them : noTHANKS"
2,Do Not Buy. Mine tore after a week of usage.,"I read the reviews here and I was excited thinking these things would be amazing. They are nice but after 5 days of wearing the mesh fully tore on the left glove. I contacted Amazon and they offered a refund. I attempted to contact the makers and to this day, still have not recieved a response. I do not recommend buying a product that can tear so easy with no response from the manufacture."
1,DO NOT BUY FROM VALEO,"The quality of their products is terrible. I emailed them directly inquiring about why has the quality gotten so bad and never received a response or any reply on returning the gloves. Luckily Amazon doesnt operate poorly like Valeo and they handled the return. I had the gloves 1 DAY and they already started falling apart. The ocelot gloves USED to be good years ago but sadly they are no longer a worthwhile product. To anyone looking to purchase these, don't and save your money. I have emails from 2009 (when VALEO actually would respond to customers) and they were aware of the quality issues back then. Sadly nothing has changed.........."
2,bought a pair a year ago,"they were soooo good, I went for an identical pair, but they quality has dropped a LOT, it is hard to show in words, these are thinner, awfully stitched, fingers are not cushioned like previous which was a big plus for me, since fingers are not cushioned, the thin leather in the fingers folds and wrinkles and is uncomfortable when grabbing the bar, they feel flimsy... totally dissapointed with the second pair..."
2,Not the same as they used to be,"I ordered gloves in late August 2012, and after no more than 2 - 3 times of use per week, they are already coming apart at the seams. They also no longer put padding in the half fingers, and the leather seems thinner and flimsier. The only options Amazon gave me were to return or write a review. I have been buying Ocelots for years, but will be looking elsewhere next time."
1,Complete WASTE of Money! Made in Pakistan! JUNK,"Made in Pakistan! Total junk, I'd rather have them from China! Valeo used to make good quality lifting gloves, 4-5 years ago. I had purchased 10 pairs back then because I liked the Pro Lifting Series Gloves. But sorry these new one's are total junk and there made in Pakistan!!! The package also says 2010. Look else where!"
2,not durable,"This gloves started off well but they don't last long. they are washable but do fade so wash by hand, only good for a few months."
4,Best gloves but for the finger stitching,"I have used many gloves through more than 40 years of training and I think the gloves are one of the best or the best I ever used, considering the following: padding, lether quality, fit, mesh quallity and even the color wich is great. Since I live abroad I bought two pairs.The only problem so far is as some other people have mentioned: the stitching in some of the fingers are coming undone, which is really a pity.I was thinking of sending them back but since the shipping cost a lot from Mexico City I decided not to,Well as I said except for that these are really great training gloves."
4,Great value,"Very comfortable; wrist support is a very nice feature...as another reviewer mentioned - get one size up...I'm typically a medium - bought the large based on the review - and it fits perfectly. They look good - provide padding where you need it and for $15.37, a great value..."
4,Excellent Product,"I am very satisfied with this product, has good grip and soft while also preventing the dolls to coerce the bench press."
3,Slowly coming apart,I have used these for about 7 months now. Threads have been coming loose on the mesh parts because the ends weren't properly knotted/secured. They work fine apart from that.
4,Pretty good,"Works like a charm, supports the wrist. No complaints here, although the fingers slots do rise a little higher than normal, but does not affect the lift."
3,not great for small hands,"These gloves are great because they look good, appear to be sturdy and protect my wrists HOWEVER since I have small hands they bulk up when I close my hands so it actually makes it harder to hold heavy weights. I guess I need some that are thinner."
3,Valeo Ocelot Wrist Strap Lifting Gloves,"These gloves are too think around the palms to get a good grip. I use them for kettlebell workouts and you need to swing the weights. But you also need to be able to have control over the kettlebell. So sure, the leather gloves have lots of padding so you won't tear up your hands, but you might also drop the kettlebell. So these gloves aren't very good for that purpose. I think the GOFIT gloves of similar style are much better, thinner, but thick enough to prevent the hands from getting blistered. Also, the wrist strap provide protection for the forearm and wrist so they are protected from getting banged up by the kettlebell if it flips over too hard. These Ocelot loves might be better for more static types of weight lifting where you are just slowly picking up a barbell or dumbell. But for swinging kettlebells, they're not good at all. Hence, they get three stars. They do protect your hands."
1,Cheaply made Valeo Ocelot Wrist Wrap Lifting Gloves,"Greetings,I have been wearing the OCELOT Wrist Wrap Lifting Gloves for 10 years maybe more but I will stop now. Recently I bought a pair of this ""VALEO"" OCELOT gloves only to find out that its made of cheap thin leather. They are NO longer made of tough materials able to withstand the rigours of a days worth of weightlifting. The image gives a false depiction of the true cheap nature of this gloves.The finger sections are made of cheap materials unworthy of a true tough hardworking weightlifting glove they used to be.Already the finger sections are wide and torn just from lifting and I only used them for an hour on two different occasions. If you are going to buy gloves do NOT buy this gloves they are not worthy of a true tough hardworking weightlifting glove. They are nice to look at but that's about it. They are unworthy of the logo ""OCELOT""."
4,Weight Lifting Gloves,"These gloves are really nice, they are padded in all the right places, plus provide support for power cleans and presses. I am slightly small in stature, 5' 3"", 103 pounds, so the gloves would fit better if an extra small size was available. The fingers could be a little longer, above the knuckle, to prevent chafing from the knurling when doing curls."
5,Great gloves,"I first bought these gloves over a year ago and I have been extremely happy with them. I followed other reviewer's recommendations and ordered a size up (XL for me)and it was the right choice. There is a little bit of wiggle room around the fingers but if I had gotten the Large size they would have been too tight. The padding that the gloves provide is great, and I really like the wrist support provided by the wrap. After more than a year of use the only significant wear on the gloves was a slight tear in the spandex on the left pinky finger, but otherwise the gloves were as good as new. I've also washed them in the washer a few times and they've held up well to that.Sadly I lost my first pair but after trying another brand and not liking the fit and support I went back and bought another pair of these. Highly recommended."
2,ok not special,"most of the time foam from palm come to your finger if you taking weight on your finger it,s irritate little bit for wrist support it,s come down mostly you have to open wrist band and close again and again on side from wrist it,s hurt some time"
2,Tiny Wrists?,"The gloves feel nice on the hands, but are quite tight, and they don't fit around my wrists without cutting off the circulation. Also, some of the stitching came apart as soon as I put them on. Afraid these are going back - too bad."
2,light gloves,THE GLOVES ARE VERY LIGHT. NOT THE HEAVY DUTY TYPE I WOULD DESIRE. THE GLOVES ARE GOOD FOR BIGINNERS BUT NOT GOOD FOR PROS.
3,Decent at best...,I have been using these gloves for almost three months now. In the three months I have had to sew these things back together twice! Now they are tearing in an area that cannot be stiched together. I loved the feel of the glove. The best I've ever worn. They just don't hold up long enough.
1,one armed exercise,"I received my Valeo Ocelot training ""glove"", still waiting for the other. Bubble pack had only one glove in it. Amazon HELP has no concept of partial shipment."
3,Are You My Mother? better for moms than children,"One of the many wonderful books in the ""Cat in the Hat"" Beginner Book series. The story arch is simple and clear, a baby bird loses his mother right before hatching and sets up to find her. While his mother is out searching for the baby's first meal the bird finds many unsuitable candidates (cats, cows, construction vehicles) to ask ""Are you my mother?"". The illustrations are simple and sweet. While not the best of the Seuss imprinted books (the better ones being many of the ones written by Theodore Geisel - Dr. Seuss - himself)One Fish Two Fish Red Fish Blue Fish (I Can Read It All by Myself)Green Eggs and Ham (I Can Read It All by Myself Beginner Books)- it is still a great book for moms to enjoy with kids at reading time. My husband gave me this book for mother's day with my child's paint filled handprints in the front cover. That is the perfect use for this book."
5,"Yes, I am!","My sister's family from the USA visited us last Christmas, and Troy, my nephew was reading this book. My daughter, Hannah borrowed it and enjoyed it a lot, that I decided to order a copy for her! The characters are so cute and the wordings are clear and easy to understand. A must buy for moms with kids 1 to 5 yrs old!"
5,My two year old twins favorite book!,"The first time I read this book I was skeptical if my kids would like it. After all, the cover isn't exciting and it looked like an old book. Boy was I ever wrong. They hung on every word and loved it so much that they have asked me to read it every day since at least once. My son even said it was his favorite book! This is the only book that they even talk about when we are not reading. A classic book for toddlers!"
3,Used book - get what you pay for,"I purchased this book used for a baby shower gift. The theme was books instead of cards and bring your favorite baby book. It was well recieved in general and a good book for a baby to grow up with and destroy, as babies do to their books.The book was writen in and somewhat tattered/not mentioned in the description. The book was decribed as being in good condition.The shipping took three weeks. Somewhat longer than I expected, however I did recieve it in time.All in all...a good product for the great cost!"
5,a little bird that goes looking for his mom,"great book for little childen cute,fun,lerning and relly good.This book shoud be for kids 1-5 . it's about a little bird that goes looking for his mom and bumbs into other animals."
5,Great children's book,Perfect to add to a kid's library; fun story and easy to read. Love the SNORT! Definitely recommend for beginning readers.
2,Not a fun book to read,"I love Dr. Seuss, and enjoy reading most of his stories to my 1.5 year old son. But this book is surprisingly bland. The illustrations are pitiful, and done mostly in browns. The story doesn't hold my son's (or my) interest past the first 6 or so pages. If I'd known this, I would've skipped this book and opted for a more classic Dr. Seuss, such as Green Eggs & Ham!"
1,traumatic and horrifying,"While i can understand the usefulness of this book for parents of adopted children, when i was little i thought it was just AWFUL!I always hated that book, and it made me terrified of getting lost and not being able to find my mother (not that i was ever in any danger of being out of her sight for 1 minute...). I remember thinking that the story was cruel and calloused, and i felt so sorry for the poor baby birdie.To this day (25 yrs later), my mother, sister and I, still joke about being traumatised by ""are you my mother?"", and refer to it as ""that awful book"".If your kids like it, that's fine, but i will never buy this book for my kids."
1,Child abandonment is not an appropriate topic for kid's,"This story is really not appropriate for young children. The premise is very frightening. A little bird spends the entire book searching for his mother and comes face to face with a pretty scary ""snort"". He does end up reunited with his mom in the end, but the main storyline plants the seeds for plenty of nightmares and anxiety. There are many better children's books out there."
3,Are you my mother,A cute story about a bird trying to find his mother. I didn't like some of the things that the bird asked if it was his mother. I thought there should have been more animals in the story.
2,are you my mother review,"the book is nice, and i remember it well from growing up. but it's too much for a toddler. it should have an age limit on it, and it shouldn't be any less than 3."
5,"Time tested, kid approved","Growing up (all those decades ago), this was one of our family's favorite bedtime reads. We'd giggle with anticipation as Mom drew closer to the ""You are not my mother, you are a snort!"" page then burst into fits of laughter (hey, this was before cable). As a published children's author, I can honestly say that ""Are You My Mother?"" was one of the core books that inspired me to try my hand at this noble profession. The best part is now I get to read it to my three girls and they love it too. Guaranteed kid pleaser."
3,Where's mom?,"I like this book because it is humorous how the bird asks such weird things if they are its mom. I thought for a second maybe the bird wouldn't find its mom but it did. Also, the little bird in the book is so cute. I think this is a good book a mother should read to a child, so they will always remember who their mom is. This book reminds me of when I'm in a store and I call mom and every lady turns around and you have to search for your mom."
2,I dread reading it.,"My son picks this book out a lot to read before bedtime. I always oblige and read it to him. But out of all of his books this one I enjoy the least. It's not because there is some moral objection to the book. It's not due to the fact that the bird is lost and afraid. Most other reviews say something about the book being upsetting for those kids that are adopted.For kids it is a good book. I would just rather read some other book as it's not as ""fun"" as other books I suppose. So I usually read this one first and then read something like, ""Put me in the zoo.""Just my observation. I find the writing dull and predictable. It just seems like it would be simple for someone, anyone, to sit down and write a book of similar nature. Put me in the Zoo and Bear in Underwear are easy for me to read to my son every night. Whenever he hands me this book I have the thought, ""ugh, not again."""
4,Great story!,It teaches children animals while having a fun story line with a happy ending! Just think how impressed the mother bird should be that her baby bird knows so many animals!
2,are you my mother?,really this price for a book that is supost to be for kids 4-5 years old this is a really good book for classroom.i wish that i had it for my own book.
3,Cute read for the kiddo's!,"This children's book was pretty good. I felt like it could've used some more color, but then I realized they probably kept the color pretty dull for the fact of the mood of the book (the bird having lost ""contact"" with his mother, it was set as an unhappy setting). It was fun to read with my little cousin because it really got his emotions going, he felt so bad for the little guy! It was fun to connect through him to the book. I recommend it!"
4,A book in any child's library,A beautiful book for first-time readers and parents alike.A good book to put babies and toddlers to sleep with.
4,"Good, solid early reader book","This is a classic early reader, very simple and repetitive for young children. It's a bit long for toddlers, and some preschoolers might find the subject matter too frightening (being lost, not knowing where your mama is). However, I still recommend having this book in your library - if it's too much for your kid this year, it might be just right next year."
5,m&msmom,"I have loved this book every since I read it at my sisters to my little nephew. Now I have my first child and when I was looking for her first cloth book and saw this I knew we had to have it! It is so adorable! The cover is really soft and I washed it first thing (you never know were it was before right?) and it held up great and no color change with the washing and drying of it. My 8 month old daughter LOVES it! You do have to be careful as the bird is on a string, I read that in another review. So I only let her 'read' it when I am with her, we absolutely love the story and the fact it cloth is even more lovable!"
5,"""Are You My Mother?""","I re-read the classic book, ""Are You My Mother?"" and I understand why it is a classic. My Grandmother read this book to my mom when she was a child and my mom read the book to me when I was a little girl and I will read it to my kids when I have them. This book is great for any child because the drawings tell the story and it will help your child learn to read because they will want to read this story again and again.This story is about an adorable baby bird that hatches and can not find his mother. The baby bird is anxious to find his mother and goes on a journey to find her. He asks everyone and everything he sees if they are his mother.This book is guaranteed to make you and your children laugh. This is also a book adults as well as children will enjoy reading. You will have to read the story yourself if you want to know what happens to the baby bird during his journey."
4,great lesson about mommy returning,"Great board book. The story is about a little bird who can't find mom, the bird hatches while she is out... but she comes back... The bird encounters other animals trying to find mommy. It reinforces that mommy will return. This is an important lesson for little ones to know that after a day at the sitter, daycare, etc... that mommy is coming back for them. The only thing about this book that I didn't care for is the coloring. However, that being said, my daughter doesn't mind the less than colorful book. She often picks it for our reading selection."
5,Justin's review,If you like dog books you should read Are You My Mother? If you can read D books you should read Are You My Mother? It is about a bird that wants to find its mother.He looks all over the place.
4,cute book,when my children were little I read this to them. Now I can read it to all the little people in my life. It always makes me smile
1,A CURSE! AN UTTER CURSE!,"Many of you, ""Parents"", have exposed this book unto your families. Same thing with my mother. She exposed this story to me. But you know what I see in this book of evil? Scary images and ideas. Look at the dog for instance. Does he look like a ""nice"" dog to you? He didn't to me. He scarred the buttons of my shirt. Everytime I look at his eyes I fill with fear. But the idea of being seperated from your parents of the worst fear factor. AND in addition. NEVER EVER EVER BUY THE VIDEO THAT GOES WITH THIS BOOK! It has bizarre music that will stick in your childs minds while the sleep and haunt them. I had many nightmares about ""Are You My Mother"" and your kids shouldn't. NEVER BUY THIS BOOK!"
5,Muy buen cuento para ninos,My two daughters have absolutely loved this book. They loved making the animal sounds as the baby bird encountered each new animal! Very educational and extremely engaging!
5,"a ""got to have it for growing up"" book","I had this one as a kid, and I will always carry a copy of it with me throughout my life, wherever I may be. It is a necessity for every child's bookshelf!"
1,Are You My Mother,I bought to read for gkids. The pictures were not on pages with words. I was actually unable to make the book legible. Very disappointed.
4,Are You My Mother?,"This was a gift - which was on her ""WISH"" List. Totally what she wanted and would recommend this product to any ""reader"""
5,i love this book,"it is adorable!!great story. got it for the niece, she'll be three years old next month & i LOVE to read. & i really like this book.so, a totally selfish & emotional purchase & gift, but my niece's mama says that her kids love to read too.so it's an excellent gift!"
5,Get Out of the Graveyard,"Beautifully packaged treatment of Dock's 1920s recordings. Kind of a banjo flailing hillbilly Robert Johnson. Sidenote, I actually met Dock when I was a child, he was a friend of my pawpaw's. They worked in the coalmines together and was wild together back in the old days. I had no idea Dock even played an instrument until I read a book by Greil Marcus years later..."
5,Banjo Hellhound,"Oh MAN! Did this guy have demons! And you usually don't hear that about 1920's banjo pickers ... but ""Dock"" Boggs is so iconoclastic he's almost not of our world. If you had the pleasure of hearing ""Country Blues"" and ""Sugar Baby"" from the Anthology of American Folk Music, you won't be disappointed by the rest of the cuts here. My partner says he sings like Alfalfa from Our Gang ... but that's because he blasts notes like he's one of James Brown's JB's. Strangely moving, and not as far removed from Nirvana (who covered ""Polly"") as you might think."
4,outrageously dynamic,"I'm not willing to say much about who plays on here (wayne horvitz of course, being a previte stalwart, is here), or of the symphonic organization of the material, or of the extraordinary work bobby does forging new music. This is because you should already know these things if you're aware of the best in contemporary hybrid music (ie. orchestrated jazz with electronics, as found most recently on his phenomenal Tzadik release, ""the 23 constellations of joan miro""). If you don't know about him, there's nothing for it but to just start anywhere, maybe with this album, on which a magical, satisfying blend of the determined and the spontaneous leads the imagination of dedicated listeners through a polystylistic soundscape. Previte can rock you and lull you entirely in the same song, and his statement is especially strong here. If you like Zorn, this will touch you much the same."
2,Not bad I guess,Feels cheap and sometimes requires a little finesse to get the light to operate. Cheap in price and construction although it does work and I've used it in the rain while hiking.Original battery that was shipped along with light works for a very short period of time. Best to purchase another battery since you'll need one almost immediately.
1,wrong item,I ordered a charger for my Bluetooth head set. i got this thing which doesn't charge my blue tooth. it's just a dongle. i'd send it back but i don't want to waste the postage. i'm very disappointed.
2,I did not enjoy this item,"This was my first DVD by delirium and I was not overly pleased with the selection. Being a stransalholic, I was disappointed by the selections. If you are used to Deleriu, they you will probably enjoy this DVD. Otherwise you have the same opinion as I did."
2,Not my cup of tea!,The seller was very gracious to take the album back. This wasn't my type of music. Too dark and goth.
1,Tiny Tiny Book,I ordered this book as a request from a friend. I thought this was a full size book. When I received my order I thought this book was a joke. The book is 2 inches by 2 inches. I was digging in the box looking for the real thing. How embarrassing! Waste of $6.Disappointed
5,"It's definitely entertaining, if you like to laugh at over-the-top antics","Essentially, several hours of a Taiwanese TV show were culled to make this over-the-top action movie. Highlights include the hero battling multiple forms of the Swastika Formation, Ninjas attacking and getting beaten off by a nude woman, and the stereotyped dialog and fighting of the Famous Black Monk from Harlem. For mature audiences, of course...Plot: The Ji Ho Ninja clan vow to destroy the monks of a Shaolin temple using their Water Spider Assault Unit, the Iron Tiger Claw, the Okinawan Thunder Fist, the Ninja Rock Climbing Formation, the Ninja Heaven Death Wish Blade and the Hell Under Earth speed digging maneuver. Luckily the Shaolin temple finds protection from a good monk, two Hare Krishna's and a monk from Harlem."
5,One of the Greatest Western Heros,This man was an absolute genius and one of the toughest men to ever venture west of the Mississippi. You will come away form this book with a healthy respect for those hardy souls that settled the American frontier and will understand why Texans revere this man....
5,charles goodnight,"Prior to purchase I wanted to know if this book covered Charlie'slife completely, to include the history making accomplishmentsas wellas those things in his life that were not exactly acceptablein the panhandle of Texas."
4,Presidents are people too.,"No, this is not a scholarly reference work. What it is is an amusing read that helps to put human faces on our Presidents- especially those who served back when we didn't see the President on TV every day. Each President is covered with an introduction of a few pages, then a series of anecdotes that range from touching to laugh-out-loud. Some are unsubstantiated, and the author is up front about that. Extensive footnotes provide documentation on every story.You learn that Lincoln was not only one of our greatest Presidents, but also one of the wittiest. That Coolidge was a penny-pincher with a dry wit. That Washington at times had doubts about his abilities. We even get Reagan and his one-liners, and Clinton with all his back slapping (though the book being published in 1996 leaves out some of the best material of his Presidency!)"
2,too familiar anecdotes in one collection,"not uninteresting, but so familiar as to add nothing new to my understanding of past leaders."
2,Hard to review this DVD,"It is very difficult to review this DVD and give it correct stars. If you consider the 2D version, it would get 4 or 5 stars as the animation and colors are wonderful with a very humorous story. BUT the 3D version is terrible. The 3D is about the worst ever, it never really produces a 3D effect and the red/blue glasses dull and changes to colors making it almost a black and white film. None of the 3D effects really work. The best of them is the falling snow. Often the viewer sees the two images ruining the whole effect and making it impossible to concentrate on the story.A recommendation is to forget the 3D version and just play the 2D version. Both are on the disk.When 3D was first introduced, people complained that they got headaches from the 3D. This DVD definitely falls into that catagory. Perhaps in Imax with the gray poloroid glasses, the effects work. NOT on this disk."
3,Nice little tale for Christmas,"Always ready to welcome new Christmas Material anytime, and when i sawthis in 3d, i knew a new addition has been added to my Holiday Collection.Eye candy for Adults, and good story for the kids."
4,Almost Just Right,"This was a very unique movie...it was a whole lot different than what i thought! it was cool! The only thing is they needed to have more stuff ""pop"" out of the screen...i kept saying come on come out further, but it didn't....*recommended*"
2,The movie is just okay - really dated,"The movie is just okay. In fact, the graphics are really dated by todays standards. The narration is by the man who used to do the movie previews, ""In a world where..."" He just didn't work very well as a narrator. The story was okay. The kids liked the 3D effect, but grown-ups will probably just leave the room."
2,"Some adult humor, not for kids...shame","There were a couple of places in this film that I didn't appreciate. If they removed those I'd give it 5 stars. An elf talks of getting caught in his wifes clothing, I didn't find that funny at all. Sick if you ask me and doesn't belong in a childrens show. I really liked the plot and the characters except for the two elves in the control room. I broke my cd in half and threw it in the trash."
1,waste of money,doesnt work in 3d blu ray player. doesnt work with 3dtv's 2010-2012 any brand.i have one imax: santa vs. snowman for sale if anyone interested lol. what a waste of $10will only work with a composite video shutter glasses system sold in early 2000's
2,Should be Santa vs. the producers,"I unfortunately wound up seeing this Christmas Misgiving on its original airing. I have always been a fan of any Christmas special since Rudolph hit the air way back when. Each holiday season I hope for something to come along that has the potential to become the ""New Rudolph"". This is so far away from that you would need the Hubble Space scope in order to see how close it came. The imaging is excellent and has been executed with great expertise. Regrettably the story makes Santa vs. the Martins look like an Oscar contender. Such a waste trying to make it more desirable by hoking it up with 3D gimmickry. You can't improve on failure. After it aired on TV I didn't see it return in later years on regular TV. I didn't miss it then and was hoping to extend the pleasure indefinitely. Can't win them all."
1,Made in China,"The Fun Factory Waechtersbach products are made in China, not in Germany. The ceramic and color have a different look and feel."
5,Great Bowls,These are beautiful bowls. I first bought these in kiwi and liked their design and rich color very much. The 20oz bowls are perfect for cereal and soup and work well with rice and stir fry servings. The 20oz size can also be used as a small serving bowl. I have since added plum and orange peel to my collection. I use Fiestaware plates and do not like any of the small bowl designs offered by them. These work perfectly with Fiestaware.
1,Not worth the money,"Anyone hoping to find innovative design ideas here is going to be extremely disappointed. The photos look dated, very '80s inspired. Mr. Jeffrey has not added any original thought or decorating ideas to the text and the book certainly has no practical solutions, not that I would want to decorate my house in a style that looks so dated. There wasn't a single picture in this book which impressed or inspired me.DISAPPOINTING. Don't waste any money or time on this book."
2,ONETHOUSAND AND ONE,"THIS BOOK, WHILE IT IS A REVIEW OF THE DESIGNER AND OF COURSE SOME OF THE INTERIORS ARE PRETTY, THE LAYOUT OF THE BOOK IS A MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT...I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND IT EXCEPT AS A REVIEW OF ""ONE THOUSAND AND ONE DECORATING IDEAS."" DISAPPOINTING"
4,Design Diary Review,"Nice book with some photos better than others. What's really interesting is the use of before / after floorplans and room shots. Very telling in their transformations. The photos of his summer house in the Hamptons are quite, quite pretty and better than some of the interiors he's done for some of his clients. Innovative interiors? Not really, but very pretty for the most part."
2,Not what I expected...,"When purchasing this product I really thought that you would be able to trace everything in the book with some emphasis on doing it without the dotted line. That is not the case. There is one opportunity to trace the letters, sentences, etc. and them you are on your own. I really wanted something else but you can't have ""a look inside"" everything. It's ok."
3,Promising but Ultimately Too Tedious,"While the concept of this game is intriguing, the slow, plodding gameplay ultimately makes it more tedious than fun. The list of scenarios and the graphics are certainly promising, but after awhile it becomes clear that far too much time will be spent watching units fire at each other-- and not do much damage. It could have really benefited from some way of skipping over the same graphics and sound effects that are carried out ad nauseam during combat. Because you spend so long waiting for anything to happen to your units or enemy units, it becomes almost impossible to gauge the effectiveness of the tactics you might try. This saps what should be the heart of the game: the ability to strategize. Even though Rising Sun is ten times more realistic and historically accurate, I had much more fun playing SSI's Pacific General, simply because the game play is so much more engaging."
4,good try,"With the right DJ Solomon Childs could sound like a champ, but on this album even though it was his first try. He and his production crew(Whoever they were)jacked so many beats that sounded better than him, Mr. Childs you sir sounded more like a chump."
5,Versatile lantern/flashlight combo,This is a surprisingly powerful litle electric lantern and a focusing flashlight. Had both the large and small versions of this but the little one's switch broke. These Dorcy originals are better thatn the new manufacturer's. I keep one in the truck and one at camp. I recommend using the Krypton bulbs and good alkaline batteries for the most light.
1,I was not very happy with this product.,"I bought this flashlight to be used as a camping spot light, as that is how it is made to seem. It is definitely made to seem way bigger than it is. It is quite small and hardly gives off light. It turned out to be useful at times over our camping trip, but we had to get other flashlights as well."
1,wrong product,I ordered this book (Contemporary Financial Management) under the belief that it was the textbook. In actuality I received the study guide. It's a good thing I didn't spend very much. So needless to say it was an unnecessary purchase and I was pretty unhappy.
2,Far too easy,The book is far too easy for professionals and for university students. The blanks exercises are really stupid. If you are not experienced in mathematics or statistics you will probably like the book because there are no derivations of formules or demonstrations of theorems.
1,Never Received Product,"I can't review a product that I never received. The purchasing experience associated with the product referenced is very negative. This is a hazard of using this online service, which is why I will not use it in the future."
1,really bad,"i waited for over 20 days and the seller told me it was sold out. I tried to contact with seller, but no response. really bad"
2,Found a better book,"I see it has a high rating so I bought it. Then I bought ""the potters studio handbook"" by Kristin muller. You be the judge . The pics are crystal clear , explanations are explained in easy to understand step by step. This is a much better book f the beginner."
4,good,"nice pictures, detailed, nicely done. easy to follow. prepare to get clay on the book as you are learning it."
4,"excellent service, good condition","I purchased this book for the excellent graphic illustration and description on throwing clay pots on the potter's wheel. We'd been introduced at my public library. Would have waited weeks to ""get what I wanted!""It came promptly in a sturdy box, which sat on my porch in the rain for the day, but the book inside was packaged well and remained dry! The cover has some sun damage and a small piece of tape on a tear, but no matter; text and illustrations are fine. I'm very happy to own a copy of this book! Thank you for being there Amazon. I'll visit again soon. Excellent service, good condition. Satisfied customer!"
5,perfect transaction,"The book arrived fast, in excellent condition, and as advertised. Julie also promptly answered some questions I had regarding the sale. Great transaction!"
3,So so,"Not sure if this was intended for a teen audience, but okay story line but very scattered and little depth. Also the download was full of messy spacing and made it frustrating to read at times"
5,Probably the best,"This is nearly a perfect football game, they actually improved over the first installment which I didn't think possible. You now have 16 plays on offense (only 8 at a time on screen), There are more long running plays and passing is more challenging. The QBs can't throw tacklers off as easily either, which leads to more sacks by non-human controlled players. They added trades, free agents and Carolina/Jacksonville. Overall this may be the best football game ever."
1,Has issue on my computer,Work fine until I go online for other project when I return program won't work. Do bother with this piece of junk
3,Help for snoring,"The breathe right nasal strips were purchased in an attempt to reduce snoring. They appear to reduce, but not eliminate, snoring. We've tried other non-surgical products to reduce snoring, and the breathe right strips are the best of what we've found so far."
5,Big help in sleeping,"I have been having mild allergies and sinus congestion, which has affected my ability to breath easily through my nose. Before using these, my sleep was exceptionally poor and unrestful; I would wake up exhausted and unrefreshed because breathing through my nose was requiring a lot of energy while sleeping.These strips have made a HUGE difference. If you're having any difficulty sleeping at night, I would at least give them a try. I feel twenty times better; six hours of sleep with the strips is better than eight hours without..."
5,Breath right nasal strips,"I am very happy with this product.It is not nearly as hard to remove,in the morning,as the colored strips."
4,Seem to work,"Personally, I receive no benefit through the use of these strips. I am a deep sleeper, and can breath through my nose without them. However, I do snore, and my girlfriend swears these strips reduce the noise to a much more manageable level. Because they help her sleep, I shell out the cash to buy them. I rate them at 4 stars mostly because given the material costs of each strip, they are ridiculously expensive, but I have not found a generic alternative."
5,Great,Helps me breathe easier at night so my hubby sleeps better. I buy this product by the dozens as I have to use them every single night.
4,Breath Right,"Seems to work well. I bought it because sometime I wake up with a raw throat in the morning and think it's from snoring during the night. I bought these hoping they would slow down any snoring I may be doing. As I said I sleep alone so I don't know if they are doing the job or not, but I don't seem to have the raw throat anymore in the mornings."
1,Atrocious - Dont waste your money,"This game is overrated by the few who play it. If you want a more fun game check out the panzer campaigns or the moderncampaigns by hps simluations.The Operational Art of War has a terrible interface, terrible game play, even worse support.If you have XP dont waste your time or money. Incompatible."
1,Oh my.........,"Possibly one of the worst games I have ever played. I'm a fan of Starcraft, Warcraft II, C&C and Imperialism, and this game was sorley dissapointing. Possibly i'm craving the building and the real-time from Blizzard."
3,Campy fun,"This album is definitely a ton of fun to listen to. The song intros by Ron Jeremy really take you back to the good old days of adult films, when they were so fun, campy, and almost innocent. The music itself is decent, although a tad repetitive and unimaginitive."
3,Great as a travelling gym mat & younger baby,"This is a great gym mat for a younger baby. My son seemed to enjoy it very much when he was younger (5 months & less). He loved the different colors. However, as he got older it did not stand up to his ""toughness"". When he really started to grab and pull at the toys from the bar, he would pull the whole bar down. In addition, the mat was too small to accomodate his growing size. He would just roll right off it. What I did was take the removable toys off the mat and let him play with them.This mat is also a great mat for when you travel. It folds up nice and is not bulky. But, again do not even bother taking it with you when your baby starts grabbing with some strength. Just take the removable toys with you and leave the mat home."
2,so this is what happened to the leftover parts to other gyms..,I purchased this play gym prior to the birth of my son thinking it would be a great travel gym. This product is somewhat misleading in its' packaging and discription as to what it actually did. I was very disappointed in it only playing one song and it seemed to be flimsy in construction when put together. I'm not sure how long this gym will last but I am looking at other gyms at this time. Needless to say this was a poor purchasing decision on my part and I will do more research before I buy another one!
2,Not very impressed,"I purchased this play mat for my son when he was about 3 months old. I like it because it is portable and brightly colored to stimulate him. Also, it said it had sounds which I assumed would be music. It includes a purple cat toy that meows and plays one song which I was a little disappointed about but that's not a big deal. What I didn't like about this playmat was that after a few weeks of playing on it, the bar no longer stands upright. The fabric that connects to the bar to hold it up has stretched out and I now have to hold the bar up in order for him to play with it."
3,A Monster With Poor Pulling Power,Fifties si-fi of the tame variety. Cast do well and the black&white photography helps. But it is a very tame 'creature feature'. OK for completists - like me!!
5,50.s Sci fi,"another 50's sci atomic fi flick about the magnetic monster, that threatens to destroy mankind, kind of laughable by todays standards, but fun to watch...."
3,A bit out-dated but still a great view of our past,I watched this flic as a young man and am glad that I was finally able to get a good copy on DVD. It's great fun to look back at a different time and country.
5,The Magnetic Monster,"Made in 1953, this movie is simple yet interesting. A good example of 50's science fiction films. It has Richard Carlson who was a semi regular participant in saving humankind. What would we do without such heroic leaders...."
2,"I should have read the reviews, before investing time...","1,024 pages felt like 5,000 pages. The Author is brilliant, weaving her tale from story to story. However, I feel that it could have been condensed. It was tedious and felt like it was never going to end. I don't want to give the ending away, but it was not as climactic for all the time invested. I'm happy with myself that I finished it, but just not my cup of tea! I should have read the reviews, first!"
3,"Well, There's No Accounting for Tastes","I bought this book on a recommendation, the recommender knowing I am a fan of Harry Potter, Stephen King, and JRR Tolkien (though not ""Fantasy"" in general), and I must say, though the elegant and precise language and gentle humor is mildly pleasing, the historical research impressive, and the weaving of historical events into fiction clever, the lack of a strong narrative thread makes it the sort of book one either throws down in disgust after about 200 pages, or forces oneself to complete, depending on ""one's"" reading personality. If you find it hard to sleep, and don't like to rely on pills, this is the bedtime reading for you."
4,"Delightful, but could have been a lot shorter--or longer.","I really enjoyed this book from start to finish, but I was surprised to find that the plot(what there is of it) doesn't start until fully a third of the way in, at which point there suddenly is a situation that pushes the action along until it gets resolved at the end. I enjoyed the leisurely pace, but since so much of the book was not concerned with what turned out to be the main action, when that action was over I didn't really see any reason the book shouldn't ramble on for another four or five hundred pages! I felt that at a certain point the author got tired of it and wanted to wrap it up quickly. The characters and ""historical"" incidents are fascinating and I wouldn't mind a sequel."
1,Strange book,"There is no redeeming qualities in any of the characters, and there is not much of a story line. The ritual of magic did not make any sense. I think this book is a book that magically bewitches its readers into thinking that it is a great story telling."
2,"Clever and at times entertaining, but disappointing","While I liked parts of this book very much, it needed editing. The sequence near the end in Venice was pure agony and I came ever so close to giving up. However, having read so many pages it seemed a shame not to finish the book. While the last few chapters helped to redeem the book, all in all the book disappointed, including the apparent tee off for a second volume. Assuming there is a sequel, I'm not likely to purchase it."
2,Starts strong and then stalls,"I read the first chapter in the bookstore aisle, fell in love with Ms. Clarke's style, and couldn't wait to spend the weekend lost in her world.Unlike most on here, who found the first 350 pages difficult and the end exiciting, I found the first section to be great fun. It was somewhere around the second third of the book that Ms. Clarke abandons her witty language, and without that I realized that I could care less about the plot or the characters.I never did slog my way through to the final rumored-to-be-action-packed final 150 pages."
3,"Read by inches, this is a 5 star read","Read only the first inch, (measured from the front cover in) and the final inch (measured from the back cover, back)and you have experienced a very beautifully written period piece/supernatural thriller.If, however, you choose instead slog through the whole thing, kudos to you for your patience with an obvious newbie fiction writer. Reading the entirety of this book is like starting a bicycle race on asphalt, then being handed a pogo stick and pointed at a bog. If you tough it out, then eventually you end up back on the asphalt, cruising to a delightful finish.Susanna Clarke is a woman with enormous talent, imagination, wonderful attention to detail and an excellent voice for parroting the masters of Old School. However, she needs to get the lead out - red, to be exact- and learn how to edit."
1,Life is too short to read bad books,"Evidently, I just don't ""get it"". And after trying to wade through this 10 lbs. of drivel, I really don't want to! This book was one of the most boring books I have picked up in a long time. There is no consistent plot and after getting half way through the book, there was not one character that I even cared about. I had read many reviews on this book and was expecting an enjoyable read. Boy, was I sadly mistaken. After reading 387 pages of this behemoth, I finally gave up. Luckily, I picked this up at my local library, so I wasn't out any money. Please save yourself the time and trouble and pass on this book. Although if you are looking for something to read at night to help you sleep, by all means, pick this one up. I was dosing usually within 2 to 3 pages."
1,More Useless Footnotes Than Actual Plot,"I tried to read this book. Really, I did. But I couldn't choke it down. Even after about 300 pages into it, I had to abandon ship. In concept, it should be a great book. Unfortunately, it is slow slow slow... Plus there are volumes and volumes of footnotes to the story that are completely superflous and have absolutely no bearing on the story."
1,"Overwrought, anticlimactic, and in need of an editor","Susanna Clarke's debut novel begins promisingly, but by about page 500 the book is starting to bog down beneath its own weight. The footnotes have by now worn on the reader's patience (they're either needlessly discursive or else pointless in their obviousness), and the dead-end plot lines are mounting (cf. the backstory of Jeremy and Strange's father, the old lady with the cats, and whatever happened to Lady Pole and Sir Walter?) After nearly 800 pages, one would think that Clarke could reward her readers (who have by now forgiven her meanderings and heavyhandedness) with some resolution. No. There is no resolution and the ending is far too 'cinematic' (and I mean that in the worst way possible). The possibility of a regrettable sequel is left wide open (though I won't bother reading it)."
3,Like and Hate,"I waiver between liking this book (I'm only a few pages from the end, so I must like it enough to keep reading) and wishing I'd never bought it.The plot meanders all over the place. There is no one distinct story. There are several places it could have ended.My wish is that this was a series rather than a single book. With over 300,000 words there's plenty here for three books.I'm amazed that Clarke managed to find an agent, much less a publisher. But, I see all those different editions and so many reviews, it must be okay.Being a writer and knowing a lot of writers, we'd like to know what spell Clarke used to get this first ""novel"" published. It couldn't be the process the rest of us are going through."
4,A flawed gem,"A wonderful book for the right reader, but unless you love the convoluted language and complecity of the Victorians, you may not have the patience to get through this-- it is LONG. Frankly, a bit too long: some footnotes run several pages all by themselves.The best sections are absolutely brilliant, but at least a quarter could have been cut with good effect."
5,MY all-time favorite,"This book is the best I have ever read and I read all the time. The combination of history, mystery, magic, military strategy, fantasy and a thrilling creepiness creates a world you never want to leave. I give this book to all my friends. Suzanne Clark is a fabulous writer. I couldnd't put it down. Also I had just returned from Ireland so the history of people and faeries along with the beguiling landscape of both worlds was very real to me. Read this!"
3,Not your average fantasy,"If William Makepeace Thackeray were still alive today and writing fantasy he might produce something like this mannered novel of magic, which explores academic rivalries, the folly of bringing the dead to life and the dangers of Faerie.It's a rather dark plot and the main characters are not entirely sympathetic but once one is hooked on this unusual tale one has to push on. It becomes necessary to know what happens to the difficult Mr. Norrell and his more talented student, Jonathan Strange, particularly after they become estranged. The mythic threads of this book are so tightly interwoven with mundane historical detail that one becomes locked into a mindset where the magical almost seems mundane also.The subgenre of ""historical"" fantasy continues to broaden and develop. Personally, I get annoyed when real people show up in my fantasy, but it is well done here, and done with footnotes also. One regrets the lack of an index."
1,Don't bother...,"Slow, Plodding, as dry and bland as english cuisine... was a chore just to pick up and try to get to the next chaper. Arcane in how its written, like a busy housewifes journal, wandering as if the reader has a bad case of narcoplexi, turning into the next chapter and wondering.. ""How did I get here?"". Skip this one if you can."
3,It had it's moments...,"Johnathan Strange and Mr. Norell was one of the hardest books to get through. I will openly admit that, even as I proclaim myself to be an avid reader. I didn't enjoy all of the footnotes that took up four or five pages, because then I got distracted from the real story.The opening was pretty good, it had conflict and resolution and old men arguing. It doesn't get much better.But then the story died off for a while in lieu of miles and miles of information to shove into my brain.It didn't really pick up again until Johnathan began visiting the faerie world and opened a pathway for the mischeivious elf that steals souls away. That's how I interpreted it, at least. It made things interesting.The problem was that after all that, there was no real plot to the book. There were spurts like from a drippy faucet which I thouroughly enjoyed, but it took hours of dredging through an encyclopedia to get to them."
2,How much time do you have to waste?,"There are at least 250 extra pages. As a fan of Dickens and Austen, I bristle to see them cited in these reviews; they were much more economical writers. I didn't throw it at the wall, I stayed until the ending, but was disappointed. Perhaps if it hadn't been hyped so much, my expectations might have been more realistic for a first novel--I blame the reviews more than the writer for my sense of relief when it ended."
2,Boooooooooooooooring,"God, what a slow book! I really had to force myself to get through it. It reads like Harry Potter for Adults, but without any of the fun or excitement. All the plot points are telegraphed well in advance, so even the thickest reader can get them.If you like your Harry Potter dipped in molasses, you'll like this. Otherwise, pass on to something else."
5,If you loved Harry Potter ...,"I loved this book from beginning to end. It is not a conventional story and may require some persistence, but I think it is well worth the effort. The intermixture of myth and fantasy is delightful. It made me want to understand more about Celtic myth."
2,Beautifully written but too PC,"This is a beautifully written story about an alternate early 1800s England where magic is discovered to be real and is soon put to work for the crown. I was enchanted by the near-Dickensian prose and enjoyed every chance I had to sit down and read until......about 100 pages into the work, a black butler is introduced, Stephan Black who is then revealed to be the most intelligent and witty character in the story. The whites around him (revealing how ignorant they really are) assume him to be some African king in exile. Everyone around him dotes on his wondrousness. I hoped that he would be some minor character and soon disappear but as I scanned the next few hundred pages I saw his name popping up again and again and again to the point where I knew that no matter how much I liked the writing and the flow of the story so far I just could not continue such an anachronistic uber-PC work."
1,Boring and Tedious,"After plodding through 400 pages of this immense, plodding tomb, including the annoying and unentertaining footnotes, I am at the crossroads of deciding whether I should waste any more of my life by continuing onward to the end. I doubt that I will because this book is simply not any fun. Maybe its a British thing, but bad is bad, no matter what the topic. I just don't get the idea for the book. Even more, I don't understand what convinced some editor to ever publish it. Okay, I convinced myself, I'm putting it down, taking it to the used paperback store and trading it in. I don't give a hoot who the Raven King is. He's certainly not an American!"
5,"Variant covers, red, white, black, oh my!","I hate to write a review that's not really a review, but I'm desperately trying to find an edition of this book that comes in a green dust jacket. I've looked high and low, sleuthing around the internet for this elusive edition but to no avail. I see someone above has posted a picture of this 'green' edition. Does anyone know where to find it or if it is a limited printing?To do justice to this book, instead of just using this as advertising space, I strongly recommend that everyone go out and pick up a copy of Ms. Clarke's wonderful novel! The book, as many people have mentioned, is a tome of about 800 pages, but once you begin reading it, it completely enthralls you and you cannot put it down.Quicksilvir@yahoo.com"
2,I was a captive audience...........,"This is an excellent book if you have a cold and need to distract yourself for a long time--I did. Looking back on the whole tedious experience I wonder how and why I stayed at it so long. Oh well, AJ Jacobs read the entire Britannica!I found myself neither liking nor disliking any of the major characters, never quite got immersed in the fantasy. I'm not sure what motivated the author to do this but given the time she worked on it, it's a tribute to her determination. To what, however?Dickens, Hardy and for that matter, Jack Finney are better choices. It will be a fine place to press a leaf collection, makes a good doorstop."
2,No clothes for this emperor,"Boring, wooden and lackluster. The characters are unengaging, and I can't make myself care what happens to them. Yes, there is a lot of period detail, but good research does not a good story make. A triumph of marketing. I predict sales fall off precipitously as work gets around."
2,Had to force myself to finish it,"I don't usually come across books that I don't like or have no interest in finishing but this was/is one of them. Now granted, I listened to all 26 cd's but there were more than a few times when I just wanted to bag it and stop listening. I am quite surprised at all the positive feedback this book generated as I feel it easily could have been half as long. I think it was a good long time before Jonathan even got introduced in the story.As it is I really can't recommend this at all. I did like the premise of the story."
1,Boring,"What a great waste of time, and 782 pagers of paper stock. I give the book only 1 star out of respect for an author that can string together that many words. The book would have been a halfway ok at half the number of pages. It's a frustrating read filled with half-baked characters and a story line that does not hold together. But, more importantly, it's such and uninteresting book to read. Unless you have a fetish for 19th century English culture. Otherwise, as a fantasy, it's a dud. [...]"
1,800 pages of BORING!,"I was utterly devastated to see all the rave reviews of this book turn out to be completely untrue. The story is written in a VERY dry, rambling style with ubiquitous footnotes - many of which are almost an entire page long and totally off subject! I waited patiently for the pace to pick up, but it never did. It was only in the last 100 pages of the book that my imagination was finally prodded out of coma-mode. This book is defnitely NOT worth the $30!"
1,Dickens on Valium,"I enjoy big fat books, Dickens, fantasy, a wide variety of books of all kinds. Somehow this book was beyond strange, it simply had no point, no tension, it was almost a documentary on 2 made-up magicians in a fantasy world. Worse, I kept expecting it to get better, to go SOMEWHERE with all of this other than just random imaginings with no real connecting theme. After all, so many critics raved about it. So I read about 600 pages before I dumped it in the garbage, a fate that very few of my books ever suffer."
1,a short review for an unbearable book,"the novel started out ok....it was a good idea and the characters were interesting. after several chapters it became tedious, then about halfway thru it was torture. style for the sake of style is acceptable, but SOMETHING has to happen to keep the book interesting. you have to have some kind of conflict. the drama in this book is as intense as watching a river push rocks downstream. i thought by the time strange went to war the book would finally start moving but....ah well it doesn't matter what happened.the book was dull, dull, dull; all style and no weight. a complete waste of time that goes nowhere and leaves you with nothing."
5,A wonderful read including the footnotes....,"I never write a review unless I like a book very, very much. As my mother taught me, if you can't say anything good, keep your trap shut. Well, mother, I really enjoyed reading this book. Ms. Clarke has to be a real smart lady to write such a detailed book about a non-existent subject. She almost convinces me that practical magic really did exist in Englandand that Norrell and Strange were the preeminent practitioners. Too bad Peter Sellers is no longer with us as he would be a prototype Norrell and I can see Peter O'Toole as Strange searching the moors for Arabella, enchanted by the man with thistledown hair. Great stuff!! Being a Welshman (we're naturally humorous, you know.), I found this book highly entertaining and hated to see it end. I hope there is a sequel and that it doesn't take 10 years for Ms. Clarke to write it!!"
2,didn't much care for it,A slow read for the casual reader. Too much detail on the magic spells and the textbook stuff. Didn't like
3,If only it were 400 pages shorter...,"Unique, clever, witty, richly detailed...TOO detailed. While the history of magic is important for the reader to truly grasp the world Clarke has created, her fantasic story gets lots in all the backstories, footnotes and slow-moving narrative. It wasn't until chapter 40-something that I actually started taking interest in the story and the characters. By chapter 50, I was riveted until the conclusion when the story unfortunately loses all momentum and ends with a whimper. Overall, the book would have been great, if only it were about 400 pages shorter!"
3,Too episodic for its own good,"There are some interesting stories in this episodic mess. Raven King, who mostly lives in footnotes, is a fascinating character. The problem is that the novel has grandiose ambitions which it is unable to fulfill. Characters fail to build. Action fails to build. After 800 pages of episodic adventures which lead nowhere, magic supposedly returns to England, and the Faerie are conveniently tamed...we know this, because Clarke takes a chapter or two at the end to tell us so. The plot and the characters, however, do not go there naturally.Very disappointing."
4,Endearingly proper,"A pleasant and endearing work. Transports you back to a slower-paced, proper and polite bygone era. IF you're willing to spend MANY evenings patiently communing with these mild and temperate men, slowly unfolding their noble (yet flawed) character and depth, you will savor this story. The slow pace pulls you in, as though these are your friends of many years and you are settling in for a quiet and reflective evening with them in the drawing room.If, on the other hand, you prefer your fantasy fast-paced and action-packed, then this ISN'T the novel for you.I particularly appreciated the willingness of these characters to gently overlook faults in others, to readily forgive, to respect each other even in the face of disagreement--we could all learn a thing or two here."
2,Going Nowhere,"Nicely written, but I'm 200 pages in and I don't know enough about these people to care to continue. Maybe it was the wrong choice succeed The Forsyte Saga."
4,Epic Whimsy,"I might not have started this book if I'd known what it was about, but I read every footnote of this atmospheric literary pastiche -- George Eliot meets Harry Potter. Not a lot of real substance, but this atmospheric entertainment is an impressive feat by the author."
3,"Too long, too detailed, too 19th century","This book is clever and is obviously well written. For my taste, however, it's slow and overly long. The style is passe. There are some very amusing comments (like when the end of the war is celebrated so that the English no longer have to go to Scotland to observe strange races). To compare it to Harry Potter is absurd. Potter is a kids' book; this is an adult book. On the whole, I think I prefer HP."
2,Nice premise but trite. Don't bother.,"Described by some as ""Harry Potter for adiults"", I'm sorry to sya it isn't. Where Rowling's plots are well constructed and move well, Clarke's move with the speed of a glacier. She is also enamored of the word ""Oh!"" - exclamation included - which starts almost every conversation and on some - many! - pages gets annoying. Nice try but someone called an ""editor"" would have been most helpful to omit the ""Oh!"" plethora and keep the plot a bit more on track. Don't bother."
1,Absolutely dreadful!,"I gave this book 1 star only because I could not post my review without one. I have just finished reading this boring, boring, boring book and I cannot believe that there are so many people out there who love it. The most tedious and boring read I have ever had the misfortune of coming across! The story is very slow moving and the footnotes are more interesting then the text of the book (although their length is quite annoying). I have read several other reviews and still cannot figure out what everyone else has seen in this novel. This book, like it's main character (Mr. Norell) is boring, tedious and given to long silences. Ms. Clark spends most of her time on character development of entirely boring characters -- some of whom are not important to the story. The entire story is told in the last 80 pages of the book although the reader is expected to plod through 720 pages of drivel to get there! If you are looking for an entertaining read, look elsewhere."
2,Disappointed,I borrowed JS & Mr. Norrell from the library. My suggestion is to do the same and if you can make it though the first half of the book then purchase it.
2,The Most Boring Book I've Read in a Long Time,This book is NOT all it's cracked up to be. I had a hard time making it through the first 100 pages and had to force myself to keep going. I wish I would have gotten it from the library so that I could return it instead of wasting my money at the book store.
2,Very Disappointing,I am an avid reader and felt compelled to agree with the majority of negative reviews with regard to this book. Unfortunately the book is very boring and hard to get through. After reaching the midway point I am trying to decide to keep on going or throw in the towel.
2,Why the hype?,"It escapes me why this book was the darling of a number of critics. The only gripping episodes were those involving the gentleman with thistledown hair, Stephen, and Lady Pole. The lengthy footnotes could be entertaining but grew tiresome as the book progressed (and it is a long book, to put it mildly); Norrell is more a spoiled whiner than a threat to Strange; and the use of magic in the Napoleonic Wars never attains the suspense and drama of a real battle. In short, steer clear."
1,No Hero!,"You know I have been plowing through this book, and I just realized the reason why I can't seem to finish. There's not a character in the book I want to identify with! I certainly wouldn't compare it with Harry Potter. Harry although gifted, never seems to see himself as special or perfect which the main characters in this book sure seem too.Do read the pages available before buying, make sure you like the style- IT DOESN'T CHANGE FOR THE WHOLE BOOK."
2,Not my kind of magic tale,"I should have known something was up when my daughter-in-law said, ""here, read this book!"". Her tone was uncharacteristically challenging. I struggled to finish this tedious tome. It simply wasn't fun, and I didn't like the characters. When I read about magic I expect wizards and the like . This book isn't about that and to be fair it was handed to me I didn't buy it."
4,Very unusual,"Never having been one to be interested in magic, I was not at first intrigued by the premise of this novel. But the story, while dealing heavily with the subject, can be read on an entirely different level. Four and a half stars."
1,S...............L.............O...............W...............,"I totally agree with many of the earlier reviews that this book is so slow that it demands you to be in the top .00001% in patience to finish it. Overall, a truly boring book."
1,What does everyone see in it?,I got this book hoping to enjoy it based on many rave reviews. I DON'T GET IT! I have not been so bored with a book in I don't know how long! I bought this at Amazon.com from an Awesome Deal I found on DailyTool.com.
2,Couldn't finish it - But it's good!,"I hate to contradict myself in one sentence like that, but honestly is the best policy. A friend recommeded this book, and I picked it up at the library. The first 100 pages was fairly smooth, but as I went farther into this long book, I rapidly lost steam. It is not the easiest read in the world, there is something antiquated and almost romantic in the way it's written, which is great at first. But when you're reading page after page it was difficult to get lost in the story when I'm stumbling over the prose. I'm going to eventually try the audio book. It is a very interesting story, and if you like a slower read, this is your book."
4,Hey that was good fun,So many reviews already detail this novel so I'll just say that i really liked this journey. I'm just amazed at the imagination of the author. One of the things which pleased me was how the author kept the characters on track and true to themselves.
3,Slog Fest,"This book has a certain charm. The style is similar to Jane Austen. That said, you could cut 300 pages out of the middle and not miss very much.The story revolves about the workings of two rather incompetent magicians named Strange and Norrell. They intend to restore magic to England.Norrell wishes to exclude everyone else from practicing magic, and Strange seeks out knowledge of the Raven King. The Raven King ruled 3 kingdoms: northern England, Fairie and Hell.The plot drags on over a decade, and a great deal of the back story is contained in footnotes (I hope you like agate type). One plot aspect is that Norrell summons a fairie to perform a task. This fairie is essentially at war with Norrell and Strange through out the book, but neither of the magicians understand this until maybe page 600.I guess I expected something more rousing when you consider the hype this book received.I think the writing is quite good, but the novel suffers from a touch edit and too many pages."
1,Horrible.,"I read this book around Christmas of 2004, and reading it seemed like waiting for the next Christmas. I kept thinking ""Surely something is going to happen, someone doesn't write a book this long with no climax or intense build-up!"" WRONG WRONG WRONG.This is possibly the WORST book I have ever wasted my time on. I have read reviews on it and they angered me so greatly I was forced to create an account to add my own critique. People seem to think books today are too ""fast paced."" There is a difference between a slow book with inricate build up that takes a long time to play out, and this book. Nothing whatsoever happens in this book. If you've already wasted your money on buying it, skip to the last 3 chapters or so and spend the rest of your time breathing, you'll be doing yourself a favor and experiencing a lot more excitement than this book has to offer. Amazon needs a negative star rating. I give this book -5 stars for wasting valuable hours of my short life."
1,Not my cup of tea...,"I gave up after 250 pages. Too much ""magic"", not enough humor. It's like Harry Potter, but in black and white, without the intriguing inventiveness. It's a social comedy, but, really, Jane Austen is much better (and funnier!)"
2,A slow book and horribly written,"I rarely write these reviews because I'm too busy. But I had to write about this one. OK, it is a decent book. But I bought it because it was touted as an adult (grown-up) version of Harry Potter. This was one of the hardest books to get through. The whole story jumped all over the place and in the end you still did not know what the plot was.Buying this in paperback might be worth it. It is not the worst book I have ever read (actually it is the next to the worst book) but it certainly is a borrow from the library level of bad. You will not want this in your library."
5,Very good reading,"I didn't think I would like this book becuz it seemed for women, but I was wrong. It is very long book but so good a read. It is about a magician, but not at all like Harry Potter, so don't think it is. It is so much better than Harry Potter. I found myself thinking more of Jim Butcher's excellent DRESDEN FILES series, that I also think is great. There is no romance stuff in it, so don't worry about that.It takes place in the 1850s or so and follows the exploits of Jonathan Strange on his quest to explore the world that cannot be seen. He makes ""jumps"" into a vast unknown area to go to other places and follow a mysterious figure that eventually begins to wreck havoc on the world of humans.These characters come to life and is hard to put the book down, even though it is very very long. But you will be glad it was long when it is done and you will still want more. I am waiting for a sequel"
2,not worth it,"This book is not worth the 800 page investment of time. The plot is developed agonizingly slowly and there are myriad unnecessary details about period, dress, and interior design. The last 150 pages are superbly done, and almost able to stand on their own. Only if you have great patience, should you attempt to read the entire book...."
2,Frustrating and tedious,"I tried to like this book, I really did. I got 50% through it and still barely anything had happened. The story wasn't drawing me in and the characters were mainly unlikeable. The comparisons to Harry Potter are ludicrous except for the fact that it mentions magic. I got the subtle humor but it certainly never made me laugh or even smile.I appreciate that it's written in the style of the 19th century. I've read some of those books and in some cases you realize why people stopped writing books like that. It reminded me of another big thick book about 'Faerie' that I also gave up on. I think that was a classic novel but I can't remember the title and I wish that I could.Very disappointing"
1,1 star for Kindle version of what should be a 4-star book,"This review is simply concerned with the kindle version, not the content. Some of the fun aspects of the book in print are the arcane and amusing faux footnotes. In the Kindle, the numbers should be a link to the footnote text, but they are not. One has to go to the table of contents, find the footnotes section, then search for that number. Come on, guys, this isn't rocket science."
4,A long read - but a refreshing piece of new fiction.,"This book is clearly not for someone looking for a quick mindless read. Coming in at over 700 pages, it is a complex tale of english magic written in a way that doesn't insult the reader.The author doesn't embellish the spells the magicians use, but does allows the reader to fully grasp their effect. Although long, the book is not so full of characters and strange names (no pun indended) that you get lost. You get a good understanding of the nature of all of the characters without getting bogged down in the minutia.This was a good read and held my attention for the entire month it took me to read it. I look forward to more work from this author."
5,one of my favorite books ever,"It's long, but so whimsical and imaginative, it's worth every page. Some have criticized the footnotes but they are a story unto themselves. Clarke creates a complete and consistent alternate universe, and it's a complete delight."
2,Wow. Can't believe how many people liked this book.,"I read reviews on this book and couldn't wait for paperback so I bought the hardcover full price - mistake. I am AMAZED at how many people actually liked this book. It was full of promise, the premise was good and yes, it was creative. But it was so painful to get through from begining to end. The characters were flat and did not come alive for me at all. It lacked emotion and was detached and cold. I couldn't wait for it to end so that I could start something else."
5,Pure Beauty,"I cannot rave enough about this book; certainly I have not been moved like this by a literary work in some time. Gorgeous from start to finish- sometimes whimsical, sometimes heartbreaking, always intelligent, fresh, and full of magic. Clarke's writing is impeccable and a pure joy to read. One always has the sense that she's subtly mocking her characters even as she allows us to love (or hate!) them. The story is breathtaking and moves along with exquisite pacing. Allow yourself to be lost in her world!"
4,"Good book, albeit quite lengthy","Like all books with science fiction genres, this books's strength is in its characters and their interactions with both the real and the unreal.The characters who are the ultimate antitheses of each other provide a good rapport. Set in a historical period in which Britain was in constant peril, this book shows life in the trenches, in the country, and in the city. More then just describing the settings of each, the crucial element is the interaction between the people and the magical persons.I personally enjoyed the level of corruption which kept bubbling to the surface as almost everyone tries to take advantage.The only donside is the length. Meeting characters and establishing the basic premise could have been an entire book within itself. This one novel could have been a three part novel . My recommendation would only be to start reading this if you have an abundance of time and patience."
2,"Terrific book, lousy Kindle file","This is a great book. Unfortunately the Kindle file does not live up to it.The Kindle file is full of missing letters (for instance, ""a ery unfriendly letter,"" instead of ""very"") and leftover hyphens from where words were broken across lines in the print edition. It suggests it was insufficiently proofed by the publisher, which is a shame.(Also, while the footnotes are hyperlinked _from_ the body of the text, they are not hyperlinked _back_ to the body of the text, which is an inconvenience if you are browsing.)"
4,"Definitely NOT ""Harry Potter for adults""","Very well written book... but awfully long. The 200 pages in the middle could be lost - without any damage to the quality of the book.It took me a while, but I enjoyed my reading. I just had to realize that this entire publishing buzz about ""Harry Potter for adults"" is a buzz - and no more than that. This is not a page turner, and never supposed to be. For me, this is something that Dickens would have written, if he had been inclined to write a fantasy book.(Not that I ever had patience for Dickens :-)So, enjoy the book - if you have enough patience, sense of humor and love for both historical fiction and fantasy. Well, it will also help if you have something action-packed on your bookshelf, for the times, when you actually have to put the book down and get some break from its density and complexity."
4,Quite a Surprise,"Not my typical read - I ventured forth with an open mind because I like to vary my reading. I admit, it was a struggle at first to get into the writing style - very different from the usual ""novels"" America reads. However, I kept plodding along. Turns out it is an enjoyable read if you're willing to just enjoy it. The ""footnotes"" are a big surprise. As you're reading the first few chapters, you're saying to yourself - why the footnotes? But, they end up filling in gaps that aren't explained in the story itself (interesting). All in all, once I was into it, I kept going back - just had to see how it ended. It was like eating a box of chocolates - some you really like, some you just eat because they're in your mouth and so you might as well chew!If you want to a read that is really ""out of the ordinary,"" this is it."
3,"Interesting Take on Fantasy, But Very Long","An enjoyable book. It was quite fun to read, but it was also quite HUGE. Ok, it was kind of boring, and you wait until the end of the book to hopefully get to all the fun. This book had an interesting take on fantasy though (it made everything more realistic and more relatable). I enjoyed it, but it was definetly not a classic. I would also not recommend it to my friends (unless they were crazy about fantasy)."
1,tedious,"Despite the positive reviews here, I found this book drudgerous. After reading patiently through more than 2/3 of the book and waiting for a plot complication, point, or reasonable struggle to emerge, I made the decision to stop reading the book.There are too many chapters in this book filled with contrived, and poor, period dialogue and nothing else, no plot struggle, no complication, only scene, characters, and dialogue - no contribution or struggle. I felt like the chapters had as much substance as an episode in a 20 year long running soap opera. There was as much substance here as ash after a forest fire. I would not necessarily discount the author though since modern fiction is nearly as much in the editing as in the writing.I am a patient reader when the work demands it. This work didn't. It was frustrating, boring, sophomoric, and poorly edited."
3,An example of good advertising,"I had read somewhere that Strange and Norrell was an adult 'Harry Potter' and was given high marks. An adult Harry Potter? Wow! Even better! I was fooled. I found S&N slow and plodding with but a couple of imaginative scenes that tended to pull - no, drag - me along. This is in comparison to the Harry Potter of which I read the first three in the series. Harry Potter I found totally absorbing and fun. (I read fantasy and SF for fun and don't like the genre to beat around the bush. It either grabs me or I chuck it aside.) I decided after 200 pages to chuck Strange and Norrell aside giving my copy to my library."
4,This book will make you believe in magic.,"Not surprisingly people are making comparisons between this novel and Tolkien or J. K. Rowling, yet it's a wonderfully original story about these two guys re-discovering the forgotten art of magic. But tampering with such powers can be perilous and open up a whole new world leading to danger, as our two good magicians find out. I rarely read fantasy books, but I couldn't help but be enchanted by this quick-paced, intriguing tale of epical and classical (and magical) proportions."
1,"Run, Run Away from This Book!","Holy moley this was a boring book. I gave up about reading about one-fifth of the way thru the book. I could just tell the author was taking unnecessary tangents and providing additional detail for the sole purpose of reaching a certain page limit - she seems to think that bigger is better. ""If the readers have to suffer to finish the book, they will like it more.""I've given up on very few books in my life - I was happy to give this one up. Given our short existence, spend your time with a better book!"
2,Good grief is this book wearying,"For the first several chapters, I just loved this book.... Interesting characters, charmingly old-fashioned style of writing, so fitting with the historical atmosphere of the novel. Then, about a third of the way through (right about at the first LONG footnote, yes, you heard me right, there are footnotes, and then there are the LONG footnotes), it started to drag a bit, maybe annoy me just slightly. Then, several chapters later, it was gratingly unpleasant to read. But, I'll admit, I wanted to know how things would turn out, so I finished it. It was painful; I wish I could have those days of my life back."
2,I fell for the hype,"Boy, is this book overhyped. I think it will be like ""..And Ladies of the Club"" -- many will buy but few will read.About page 400, I stopped reading because what little plot there was had disappeared. I couldn't work up the energy or interest to find out what happens when the magicians feud.I wish I hadn't wasted my time."
2,I don't like it,"I titled my review after the 2 star rating, because it seemed the most appropriate way to express my opinion. I don't like it. Is it a bad book? Maybe. Is it too long? Maybe. All I know is I don't like it.I slogged through 500 pages and just couldn't bring myself to read anymore. I wanted to read an interesting story, and I just could not remain INTERESTED. Maybe it wasn't meant to be read as a story. Maybe it was meant to be viewed as a work of art with it's Dickens-like prose. Maybe.Whatever interest I had upon picking up the book had disappeared after 100 pages or so. The other 400 pages was simply me saying, ""Give it some time, it's a big book."" Well, I finally ran out of patience on page 500. It's on to the next book for me."
3,Jonathan OK,"I liked Jonathan Strange: I appreciated Susanna Clarke's twist on the standard magician story and found the book's central characters very compelling. But readers beware: the book is frequently boring. For quicker-paced sci-fi summer reading, I would recommend John Twelve Hawks' brand new The Traveler. Unlike Jonathan Strange, The Traveler never plods: it moves like a speeding bullet from start to finish. Plus, it's every drop as erudite as Jonathan Strange: it delivers a blistering critique of the post-9/11 surveillance state. For a summer read with smarts and action, The Traveler is your best option."
3,Well written but heavily needs an editor!,"I bought this book from the high reviews it has recieved and the plot sounded very creative and intriguing. But, as I soon learned, no matter how creative a story is, the story needs to be paced well and shouldn't make the reader be thinking about the other unread books waiting for them on their shelf. I read about seventy pages through and the book failed to contain my interest. Although, I will give Clarke credit, for her writing style is very enjoyable and her characters are very believable, but still, the book needed a an editor very heavily. The story was slow to get started and the beginning was just a long drawl. Hopefully, the freind that is going to recieve this book will enjoy it better than I did."
2,struggling....,I am a voracious reader and this is my gendre...I find it a struggle to finish. There is no care to build characters so I could care less what happens to them....Footnotes get VERY obnoxious...I don't think it's that clever or funny...SO not in the caliber of Austen or Tolkien as rated...don't waste your time.
3,An OK read - hoping for a 2nd effort,"Clarke obviously put a lot of effort into this book. However, I think it was at least in part misdirected.I think the book is overly long and attempts to be too biographical in scope. It tells a long series of the adventures of Jonathan Strange which traverses both continents and realities. It's too rambling and unfocused to be a really good read.While attempting to include too long a stretch of time and too many events, the book fails to flesh out the events to a satisfying degree.If Clarke had opted for concentrating the conflicts of the story into a shorter time frame and fewer events, and really developing the plot and narrative around those elements, this could have been a great book.I really look forward to something else from this author, but I won't buy another 1000 page behemoth. A nice tight 300-400 page novel focused on tellnig a story, but with the same wit and humor, could be a real pleasure."
2,Whew!,"I read all the wonderful reviews and bought this book. I have picked it up 3 or 4 times and tried to get into it and I have yet to manage reading it. I just CANNOT get interested in the story or the characters. I LOVE the genre. Maybe it is the writing style, I really don't know. I would love to enjoy it the way others have but it puts me to sleep everytime I pick the darn thing up."
1,Ugh,"I have tried, twice, to get through this book. I really wanted to enjoy it. I know there are people who defend this book with a strange sort of vehemence, and usually I am the first to say that everyone has a right to an opinion. But Great Zombie Jesus this book is more a chore than a pleasure! Subjectiveness be damned, I cannot for the life of me understand how anyone got through this overwritten, overwrought, meandering mess of a...something...I hate to say ""novel"". Honestly, it reads more like a university student's lame attempt at great Victorian-style prose.Sigh.Normally, I wouldn't bother to review a book I hadn't finished, but thought that, for someone reading through these reviews before purchasing the book, I will gladly mail you my copy. Hell, I will even pay the postage if it means getting rid of it. I tried putting it out with my recyclables, but they said they don't take human waste material."
1,Worst book I have ever finished,"I've read many thousands of books, and many more dense and detailed that this one. That people who like the novel seem to deride people who don't as being unintelligent or not having an attention span makes my blood boil.After 200 or so pages of this book, I just felt irritated beyond belief, and I could just imagine the author at her PC or typewriter with a smug look on her face thinking how great she is. I get that at times with Pratchett too. The footnotes that increased throughout the book added nothing and just took you out of what little story there was. How I finished it 'll never know, but I have to say it's the one book I really wish I'd not botehred with as it's just empty. Of everything. That's just my opinion.... If you feel otherwise that's fine.... I just don't happen to like prose for prose's sake. To me that's just self-indulgence.If I could have given this book minus stars I would have. I didn't just not enjoy it. I hated it."
2,Well written but.....,This is a well written novel but somehow the characters lack charisma. I felt absolutely no empathy for anyone in the book. The story loses steam in the middle and goes downhill after that. I would give this a miss and try Fingersmith by Sarah Walters instead or the classic Woman in White which is a thousand times better!
1,A Tedious Waste of Time - I Can't Believe I Finished It. I Want That Part of My Life Back!,"This book was a real disappointment. Such plot as there was moved, if at all, with extraordinary sloth. I could not bring myself to care about any of the characters. It was a death march in which the author painted impossibly broad and self-indulgent tapestries of backstory and side details while ignoring any semblance of story momentum.I can't believe that I actually finished it. It was probbably the incredulity I felt at having wasted so much time up to the point at which I had by the read that kept me going. ""There has to be some redeeming material up ahead! I can't really have wasted this much time!"" No such luck.I wish I had back the time I spent reading this book."
2,Sooooo Disapointed,"I listened to a review of this book on radio 5 live (UK radio). All the reviewers were very exited and enthusiastic about this. One even went so far as to compare it to Tolkein. However, I found the story to be slow and plodding, the storyline boreing, even the narrative I thought was far too elaborate, and there were the continuos distractions of the appendices, these would have been better at the end of the book. I hope this wont put of too many readers because for what it is its OK but, Feist,Eddings,and of course JRR do it far better and more eloquentlyjohnwi19"
3,"If magic isn't your bag, don't buy this book!","I got through 200 pages before giving this book away to someone who actually cares about magic, which apparently I do not. I would probably enjoy a book written by this author on some other subject, as I cannot fault the writing at all."
1,200 pages in and still looking for a plot,"I was really looking forward to reading this ""Harry Potter for adults"" but 200 pages in I realized I was still looking for a plot. The most magical thing that happened were potential story lines that would disappear or which took the reader on rides to nowhere special at all. I wanted to give this ""story"" more of a chance because of all the good reviews it has gotten, but I didn't care about a single one of the characters. This story reminded me of what it might be like to visit a retirement home to visit with seniors - except instead of hearing interesting stories of times past which revealed universal truths about the human experience, they just droned on and on about disjointed half-memories. Obviously this book was a labor of love, but it's also a labor to read. Honestly, this was such a painful experience that I could feel myself get a little older with every flip of the page."
2,Starts slow and lacks tension,This is not a book that grabs your attention right away. The story starts with Mr. Norrell whom is neither an interesting character nor a likable one. Jonathan Strange is only moderately likable. Strange is introduced much later in the book.The plot is slow to develop and does not really begin till maybe the last 3/4 of the book.The strength of the book lies in Susana Clarke's development of this world. The many small side stories help creates an interesting world but at the same time it slows down the story.
2,Was it written for reviewers instead of readers?,"As a three-books-a-week reader, I looked forward to Clarke's opus. Great disappointment! The novel seems to have been written for major book reviewers of the world instead of readers.The characters are one-dimensional -- even Jonathan doesn't come to life -- the insider jokes are tiring, and the plot's twists and turns are too obviously manipulated.All in all -- thumbs down."
4,If Dickens and Austen had collaborated....,"...on Harry Potter, this would be the book. Although magic is the central theme, it's really heavier on the parodying of early 19th century British society than on magic -- faux footnotes and all. Occasionally a bit of a slog, but worth it!"
4,Very good book,"If you are into magic this is a fun book to read, I liked the use of contrasting characters for Strange and Norrell. Overall the story was put together very well and was not overly long. The very english style was a new and interesting read for me and I rather liked the setting of the story. I even learned a few new words in this story. I await the next book, unfortunately I read this one in a very short period of time."
4,What a book!,"Wow...look at the size of this book! I love fat books so it wasn't really intimidating, but I did not know what to expect. At first it took some time getting used to the archaic style of writing Susanna Clarke favors, but it quickly became clear that it was necessary to establish the somewhat dark and mysterious atmosphere rampant throughout the novel. It certainly is an intense book, but utterly enjoyable. At first the footnotes were a little disconcerting, but quickly became a part of the story. After a while I began to look forward to the footnotes, as they seemed to be ""proof"" that there really was a history of magic! Interesting also the illustrations sprinkled throughout the book, something that is rarely found these days.All in all, an utterly engrossing work of fiction! Thanks to Susanna Clarke's first novel (can you believe it?) I burned the midnight oil many times in the last couple of weeks.I am looking forward to reading more fiction by this author."
1,Did any critic actually read this book!,"This is the most boring, wordy book I have ever suffered through. I have 150 pages left, and can only hope everyone is dead by the end of the book. I feel like I am already. Who nominated this as a great book? If you attempt to read this waste of paper, be sure to skip the hundreds of foot notes (yes there are foot notes in a book that is a complete work of fiction)They add nothing to the story and are never referenced again. This book has been a complete waste of time."
1,Boring and hard to read,"The first half of the book is devoted to Mr. Strange, who is a thoroughly unlikeable character. Well, I thought, once Jonathan appears on the scene,it will pick up. It didn't.Bottom line: it's just not enjoyable. Very little plot. No interesting characters. A few howling anachronisms in the characters' mouths that just break the spell (no pun intended)"
1,Horrid,"It might be worth the money if you really need something to start a fire with. This was the MOST boring book I've ever read, something finally surpassed wuthering heights from when I was a junior in HS (11 yrs ago now). Abandon All Hope, Ye Who Enter Here..."
1,Caution: do not read unless you need a nap...,This is one of the most boring books ever written. A complete waste of money.
2,Boring!,"I picked up this book because it won the Hugo award, but it was boring, boring, boring!I gave up after chapter seven, the story goes nowhere very fast.The only thing that I found interesting about this book was that is actually sounded as if it had been written in 1808. It reminded me of The House of Mirth.Update - I thought that I would give this book a little more time to grow on me. I am now at Chapter 31, and it is still as boring as ever, if not more so! The Harry Potter of adults my eye.Another update - after investing so much time in this book I thought that I might as well finish it. It ends as it begins, meandering along a road of pretty prose with no real end in sight.Apparently we are being set up for a sequel.If you like Dickens, read Dickens, and if you like Melville, read Melville, but don't call this a classic just because of the lovely way it is written."
1,Have to step in here...,"It's hard to fathom why so many of you love this book, to say nothing of the inference that A.S. Byatt would appreciate it. I gave up around page 200, as this was too simple a work, and too tiresome for further perusal. Having just finished a couple of really well written novels, I can also say that there was nothing special about the author's prose whatever...Who is reviewing this work-fans of Harry Potter? Finally, if you want to read an intelligent, throw-back kind of novel with real drama, well drawn characters and a truly epic feel, pick up Palliser's ""The Quincunx"". Light satire and pale imitations of Jane Austen do not a classic make."
1,Not worth the effort,"This book has a great premise and, perhaps, great promise. Unfortunately, it fails to develop the former and never delivers on the latter. There is action and there is character development, but the action is so slow and so wrapped in seemingly endless descriptive passages that the characters seem to be frozen figures from a video game with processor lag. I read the whole thing hoping for a change of pace (I was stuck on an airplane), but by the end of the third chapter I just did not care what happened to these muddle-headed muggles with their pseudo-Victorian sensibilities and their utter lack of any spark. I left the book on the plane."
2,How can a book about magic be Boring?,"I'm at page 300, and I struggled to get there. I will put it down for a bit before resuming. The problem is that one of our main characters, Mr. Norrell, is a dud! I don't care the least about him. And the prose, while good, is rambling. This book was in severe need of some editing. On these pages, I've seem some readers compare it to Jane Austen. Don't compare this style to that of Jane Austen. Jane Austen is witty, and her characters have depth and life. The characters in Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell are mostly flat.With that said, there are some subplots that intrigue me; however, it takes so long to resume those stories that I get bored until she picks up the interesting twists again. All in all, I see a lackluster main character, and a style that kills a potentially interesting story in mundane details."
2,a tad wordy,"The story is interesting once you dig it out from under mountains of extraneous words. This book needs an editor who can cut out 500 pages. If this is what wins hugo awards these days, I'll stay away from award winning books. Give me Jim Butcher any day."
5,This was a great story!,"It was interesting reading the reviews for this book to discover the divergence of opinion. I personally loved this book! It captured my interest from beginning to end. I thought it was an engaging story which captured the human condition with well developed characters, and well-researched historical references woven in. I do agree that the footnotes become tedious, and are not always relevant to the story line; however they are not intended to be. As supplemental information, they did a good job of drawing me into the illusion of an alternative history.You don't have to be a fan of the mystical to enjoy this book, just a fan of a good story.To be fair, this is a long - and large - book - definitely not for the plane."
5,A joy from the first page to the last,"Clarke has written an incredible story that combines fantasy fiction with what feels like 19th century literature. Fans of either genre should very much enjoy this book.One of the best things about ""Strange"" is that the author took her time in unraveling the tale for her readers. Sure, the basic story could have been covered in 250 pages, and many authors would have chosen to do so. But at best, that could have only produced a book that was good. Readers of such an abbreviated version would not have realized it, but they would have been short-changed. Instead, Clarke wanted to emerse readers in 19th century life and magic. She included rich details that give the reader a flavor for both the time period and the individuality of each character. The reader has time to savor the book and really become engrossed in it. That is what turned an interesting idea into an astounding achievement."
2,Slow with little to no pizazz. Lots O' footnotes though.,"I bought this book based on some of the early reviews and I am having a hard time getting through it. It is slow, with not very much life to it. It is fantasy, but it is not very 'fantastic'. It might be a little too historically accurate for my, bogging down in the details instead of concentrating on plot-worthy events. The footnotes are fairly numerous and distracting. I am not sure if I will finish the book, similar to several other reviewers here."
3,This Book isn't Very Good.,I can't understand why this book has sold so many copies. The idea that one guy (Mr. Norrell) would grab all the knowledge of magic in the world except for Johnathan Small strikes me as stupid. There are no characters in this story that I liked. Both title characters are jerks.The story has no real point to it. I can't recommend it.
4,Frustrating but finally worth it,"The first part of the book took a long time to get me involved, but because it had been recommended by someone I respect, I stuck with it. Once the plot got interesting, the characters began to be increasingly frustrating, to the point that I almost stopped reading. Again, I stuck with it-this time, not only because of my friend's recommendation, but because the plot had captured me enough that I really had to find out what was going to happen. The last 100 pages were extremely satisfying, and made clear the author's reasons for the seemingly incomprehensible and inconsistent behavior of the characters. It was intriguing, sad, strange and finally made sense."
4,"Wonderful, except for the unsatisfying ending","This is a wonderfully written, fascinating book, it deserves all the accolades it has recieved. It is a long, somewhat slow and involved read. . .this is a book to pay attention too, not to skim. . .and it made a nice change from more action based fare.However, I just don't understand what modern writers have against a happy ending, somehow people think that in order for a book to be ""literature"" -- instead of ""just a book"" -- it must be depressing. If I wanted to be depressed I'd read a newspaper.I do not intend this review to stop people from reading this book, I don't regret buying or reading it, but I do wish I'd had a warning about the place it would end up."
5,"Haven't Finished it yet, but I can't wait to!","I checked out this book from the library several times, and I could never finish it in the 2-week rental period, so I figured buying it at the low price offered here would be cheaper and easier than paying all the late fees I would incur if I continued to borrow it. I'm still only part way through it, but I've enjoyed owning it, reading it, highlighting in it, and I would recommend it."
5,Amazing!,"Wow what a crazy, amazing and intreguing book. I can see how people might be put off by this book. It can be slow in parts (though it does pick up) and it's not a crazy page turner you have to finish now type book. But on the other hand I agree with the critics (which are quoted on the back of the book) that ""it's an instant classic""- Kirkus review; and that ""many books are to beread, some are to be studied and a few are meant to be lived in for weeks. Jonathan Strange and Mr. Noreell is one of the last kind.""- Washington Post. The book is extremely well written and I think should be added to English Literature classes.It is definitely unlike anything else I've ever read, the plot is fantastic and original, the chracters are amusing and the footnotes are a blast. I'm also very glad they didn't americanize the spelling of certain words. A++ One of my favorite books ever. You MUST read this book."
3,Another Piss Poor Kindle Ed.,"This is a great book, a worthy follow-on for those burned out on Harry Potter-style magic. Set in 1800s England, Clarke employees the usage and spelling of the period (shew instead of show, sopha instead of sofa), but the bad Kindle translation just about ruins this fine read, making some lines of text so confusing it is impossible to untangle the intentional spelling from the hamfisted data entry.Buy the book, but avoid the Kindle ed."
4,"Covertly Witty, Plodding Pace","This book has a very plodding pace, especially the first 250 pages. I put it down several times before forcing myself to read that far. It gets much better 1/4 of the way through. I could appreciate the very dry humor, and laughed out loud several times, but it's definitely not a page-turner. I read a lot of it aloud to my family on a road trip, and actually enjoyed it a great deal more. There is so much hidden humor which is easy to scan over when reading silently. I loved the footnotes--very satirical of actual scholarly writing."
2,Excessively Long and Pretentious,"I relish books with alternative history themes, settings in the 19th century, and touches of magic. This book contains all of those, yet I did not enjoy it at all. I found it ponderous and dull and the characters thoroughly unengaging. I was quite disappointed in it, and I don't believe I will read any of this author's work again."
5,Not to be missed for classic novel fans,"Do not believe the pathetic reviewers who have come before me saying they couldn't care about the characters. What book were they reading? Are they so used to ""villains"" and ""heroes"" that they can't care about interesting but flawed characters? The novelist Ms. Clarke is most like in my opinion is Thackeray. She views her characters from a slight distance, highlighting all their hypcrisies and flaws, but lovingly. I have read a great many novels in the last few years that attempt to reproduce the 18th or early 19th century in tone as well as in setting, and this is the FIRST one I thought successful. If you like Fielding, Austen and Thackeray, you'll love this book. If you like whipping through bestsellers you pick up at your local Target, don't insult this book by trying to read it."
5,Magic Abounds in Words and Atmosphere,"I read this book in January 2005 while it was still cold and snowy and dreary here in Connecticut. Now, I'm a person who doesn't like Winter, but this book had me wanting it to snow forever just like I wished the book would go on forever. I was so transformed to old England, I had to keep tucking my feet under the covers to keep the draught out. I kept expecting the gas lantern to go out and I don't have one. I kept wanting a hot cup of tea.Magic in the book and in the air around when you read this book."
2,Kindle transfer is distractingly bad,"This is not a criticism of the story, which I enjoyed. This is an admonishment to Amazon on their pathetically poor effort at transferring this book to the Kindle format. Transfer errors are so common that hardly a page does not go by in which you as the reader are not yanked out of the flow of the story as you try to worry out what the original text was. It is as if someone was paid to cut the pages from the book, scan them into a computer, remove all of the white-space, and leave the computer to its best efforts to guess at the original words. Well fine if that is the only way to establish an electronic copy of the book, but I can think of no good reason why they did not employ a proofreader to correct the very numerous and obvious mistakes.Shame on you Amazon. This is NOT the quality of product that I was expecting when I purchased my Kindle."
5,Floating into magic!,"It took me a few pages to get into the story, as the author takes you gingerly into the reality she has created for the readers, which is so close to mundane that you suspect that the story is just a mundane story about magic, until a few chapters later you find yourself burning the midnight oil. She describes the characters to sound, once again, quite normal, and a few words down the line you realize that the same characters are no more mundane than when a military general confides in you that the government is poisoning body fluids through tap water or some such quiet madness. She is witty, humorous, and makes imagination beautiful."
5,It Should Have Won Every Prize for Fiction that Exists,"Magick is a topic close to my heart and several of my friends and I discussed this book. It still gets mentioned often. To do magick or to study it as an arcance topic - that's the question here. I adore great big fat books. I like to live in their worlds for awhile. And I will put this book up with the best being currently written. As good as ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy; and maybe a bit better. Please Susanna Clarke write more and write fast. I'm a geezer and don't want to miss out on your vision."
4,"Enjoyable, but just too long and rambling","I did enjoy the half of Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell that I read, but I just got too darn tired to continue. I am happy to read big, bad, heavy books that will conk me in the head every time I try to read in bed. I quite enjoy English works that take a long time to build up to little or nothing if the journey is good. I freely admit I loved the historical style, complete with footnotes, in Jonathan Strange. It seemed like everything that I would want in a book, history, magic, written for grownups! But it was just too much reading with nothing going on to take. I have to agree with other reviewers, it is a personal style thing. Perhaps at another time in my life I will come back to it, but for now I'm okay with not knowing how it all ends up."
1,Terrible,"I made myself finish this book. It was tedious and horribly boring, all 800 pages. I would have much rather read a book about the footnotes because they were much more interesting. This book has about as much magic in it as a chopped onion does. Now I know why it took her ten years to write it; she kept getting bored and forgetting to write more. Why are all these pseudo authors recommending other books in almost all of these reviews? There is a special section for that and it's not in the review box. Yes this book is terrible but using the review area to plug for other books is disrespectful, and not helpful at all to people who are looking for a book review not an advertisement."
1,Interminable chore of a read,"I agree with the other reviewer - the writer is technically gifted so she deserves at least one star. After all it is her first attempt. But I forced myself to finish this book and lost all patience with her in doing so. The only character for whom I felt even the vaguest of stirrings of empathy was Stephen Black. The book lacked warmth. And she was allowed to be totally self-indulgent with the footnotes, which really grated on my nerves. This is a total shame. This same story could be told well. It simply isn't."
1,Magic should not be this dull,"What this book lacks in imagination and verve, it tries to make up for with footnotes and breathless, ""Victorian"" sounding prose.It doesn't work.Several of the characters spend a lot of time under some form of enchantment, but the enchantment itself is rather dull, and mainly consists of the characters being forced to dance when they really don't feel like dancing. This ""enchantment,"" and that term merits scare quotes, leaves the charaters listless in their daily lives. They are just sort of tired and bored, which is likely how you will feel when you are reading this book."
2,Too Much Like Assigned English Reading,"Many of the reviews of this book have noted how faithfully it recreates the literary ambiance of Regency or early Victorian novels. As far as I am concerned, that is the besetting flaw of this book--it is endlessly discursive. I freely admit that books of this nature were required reading for university English literature coourses, and being forced to read them may have poisoned my view of ALL novels in the genre, whether originals or, as here, deliberate copies. Nevertheless, I must say that ""Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell"" reminds me of nothing so much as a cross between ""The Hobbit"" and either ""Silas Marner"" or one of Anthony Trollope's more lugubrious novels."
1,Bewildered but not bewitched,"As I was getting to the reviews here I noticed that the editorial review above used the expression ""Sophisticated, witty..."".Sophisticated and witty are two things that this book definitely isn't. It's predictable and obvious - you can practically hear the author's mind clunking uncomfortably. It is also not funny in the sense of ""funny"" generally used when talking about literature. In the sense of ""funny"" used when talking about daytime TV, maybe it is.Perhaps the book is an outstanding example of the Fantasy genre, I would't know. But as literature, or even a good read, it's an insult to your intelligence. Stay well away."
5,SPELLBINDING,"...no pun intended.Encapsulated description: Jane Austen + Harry Potter + Lost. Fans of Austen will revel in the regency-era setting, as well as the quaint language in which this comedy of manners (of sorts) unfolds. Harry Potter devotees will take pleasure in this lively tale of 'British Magic,' and will appreciate the complexity and darkness of its characters. And anyone who lamented the cancellation of ABC's Lost will gladly sink into the mysterious creepiness of this wonderful novel.This has been my favorite book of the 2000's (so far) and I look forward to devouring everything else Clarke writes!"
4,Great book,"I can't believe I bought this for a dollar! Great book, especially if you only paid a dollar. My copy is not for sale, sorry."
3,An inferiority complex in the making,"One of those amazingly, intimidatingly clever, but witty and compulsively readable books (like The Eyre Affair) that make one glad to be a reader! It seems ridiculous to cite an impressive historical accuracy in a book about magicians, but this period was a favorite of mine to study, and all the little details she puts in seem to be dead on the mark. I like that in a work of fantasy! (I'd have given it four stars, but the ending was depressing--at least until there is a sequel.)"
2,Moo.,Clarke's novel is essentially pastiche. She has adopted (one can hardly say mastered) a certain voice then spends her many pages ruminating in it. But there is more --much more-- to good writing or storytelling than chewing the cud. One reads page after page longing for something to happen. It seldom does.
3,great expectations...diminished returns,"In JS&MB;, Clarke proves she's a wonderful writer. The scenes of wintry London and rural England are fabulous, and she has a knack for crafting characters at their persnickity best. But the biggest problem with this book is one of momentum, er...the lack of one. Little keeps the book moving forward, and it's a heavy book to keep balanced on your chest at night. I loved the characters, loved the mood, but the book on a whole never really goes anywhere. It's a quite maddening read. I really wanted to love this - devoted weeks to it, but the enchantment never came.I too was taken by the Harry Potter meets Victorian England marketing ploy. And the book does plod like an Jane Austen novel. All in all, more a page borer than a page burner. But three stars because Clarke can write. It's a shame she can't pace (or edit).And the footnotes detract. What's she trying to prove? As the book was coming to an end, I was glad for them though (they made the pages shorter)."
4,Loved it..But,"This book was bound to be rated on a diverse scale.I thought the book was a superior work with flaws. I found it to be a very well paced read, despite its size. It held my interest, although there were many times ,the plot was simply lost. A good editor would have been helpful.The extensive footnotes added to the reality of the ""world"" created by Ms Clark, but they too became annoying after a while. It almost seemed that the author had so much to write that it simply poured onto the page without structure.Gee..lots of negatives. but like magic, I somehow thoroughtly enjoyed the book and was sad when I finshed the experience."
3,Tedious at points but engaging in others,It had me hooked from the very beginning but as I went on in the book I found some characters and chapters completely useless to the main plot of the novel. Nonetheless I finished the book and was glad of it. Worth a read.
3,I wanted to like it,"I really did want to like this book. I enjoy fantasy books and don't shy away from a long book (this one is 782 pages). Though there were some fun, imaginative parts to this book I found it much too long for what it delivered.An often-mentioned character for whom the last third of the book is named, The Raven King, appears on only about 3-4 pages in the entire book. After I understood the aspirations and human faults of the two main characters I began getting excited about the coming of the Raven King, but his appearance is brief and his character woefully ndeveloped. It was the Raven King, rather than those who populated the pages of this book, that I longed to learn more about. In a sense, the book was an appetizer...and the entree never arrived! In the end I wound up feeling manipulated. This is the author's first book, and I couldn't help feeling that I just spent money, and time, indulging in what ammounted to a marketing campaign for what is bound to become a series."
2,"Long, longer, longest","I was very anxious to read this book that I had heard was meant to be oddly fascinating and curious and intelligent...however, although the author is obviously quite keen on discourse and perhaps history and tries for an interesting yarn, this story lacks any real aspect of great storytelling. I found myself pushing and pushing myself through the book at all stages. It is very much a long-winded work and, once you're half way through, you know you're INVESTED so heavily that you are unable to drop it before reaching the glory of the story ending. But when the outcome is sadly lacking, you'll find yourself suffering great pangs of remorse for having wasted your precious time. I think what happened here is that the author had a great first draft on her hands but the thing was so bloody long she couldn't bear to take a crack at re-writing it to make it great."
3,"Just an ""okay"" novel","I know I've read a good book, when I turn the last page and say ""wow, that was good!"". That didn't happen for me with this book. It wasn't a page-turner for me. For me, it was a lack of excitement and adventure in the book. If you find war exciting, then maybe you'll like this book, because that's where most of the book ""moves."" Otherwise, I found it very slow-paced. There are some moments in the book where there's some mystery and excitement, but they don't last for long.I wouldn't recommend buying the book, but if you've nothing great to read this would be okay if you needed something to read and you could borrow it from someone or the library."
2,Not bad...,"A great, imaginative story that could have been more effectively told in half the length.I ended up skipping whole pages b/c the extraneous descriptions and actions went on and on and on.I liked the story, but the book was torture to get through in some spots."
5,"Original, haunting and evocative","I concur with most reviewers that Susanna Clarke's debut alt-history novel is ingenious and witty, fantastical and humorous. Imagine if Lewis Carrol, Oscar Wilde, and JK Rowling had all written a novel together--that about sums up Jonathan Strange"
2,Lots of Hype...,"I bought this book due to the fantastic articles written in the New York Times Book Review, Entertainment Weekly, etc. While this book has incredible detail and constructs an elaborate world, I had to force myself to stay with the plot and continue reading.As a former graduate student, I am used to books that are intricate, scholarly and somewhat dry. Around 500 pages in, however, I gave up on this one. Perhaps, I might return someday to find out what happens. But at the moment, I prefer to spend my time reading something more engaging."
4,200 pages too long,"Overall, an entertaining read - but I agree with previous comments that it will not be to everybody's taste. There's a good dollop of Henry Fielding in there, with the 18th century novel's speed and pace at the outset, and whilst Clarke undoubtedly needs a lengthy space to set our her vision of 19th century wizardry, the final 200-400 pages sag and could have done with more judicious editing. Plus the change in tone here and in particular in the final pages wasn't 100% convincing. However, this is a book that sweeps you up in its world and carries you along: definitely a good example of the willing suspension of disbelief. And some of the minor characters are fantastically good value (Lord Wellington for one)."
4,A few magical moments . . .,"Not only could this book give readers a concussion if it fell on them while they drifted off to sleep, (heavy, huge hardback edition), but at times it could quite possibly be the cause of the sleepiness. Still, big and unwieldy as it is, the book is worth a look.Susanna Clarke's book, heralded by some critics, is, in my humble opinion, a strange combination of wonderful prose and monotonous blandness, interspersed with a dribblingling of truly inspired and magical moments. The search for those moments is what kept me determined to finish this lengthy undertaking. But in the end, and though the writer indeed deserves praise for weaving a story of this verbal magnitude together, there just weren't enough of those magical moments to allow me to feel satisfied.In the end, what comes to mind is that reading this book was a bit like reading one of those textbooks that Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell spent so much of their time with. Just add the dust."
2,Completely Overrated,"I bought this book because it had such good reviews, but found myself wanting to put it down often. Well, it is completely overrated and much too long. Although fairly well-written, it is slow and not exciting at all. I can at least say that about the Harry Potter series. Thing LONG and hard about bothering with this slow moving sleeper."
2,Interesting but not great,"Another succesful marketing of a LONG novel that really is just ok. It never gets where it wants to go, or I guess I should say that it never took me there. Sort of the DHALGREN of the fantasy/magic genre. But wait this just won the HUGO award for best Science Fiction novel of the year. What?? Science Fiction?? Hey, if HARRY POTTER can win the HUGO then why not this. Hugo Gernsback is spinning in his grave! Some day maybe a science fiction novel will win the HUGO again - but I doubt it."
2,Difficult to read,"First, I have to say that I only got through 50 pages of the book. It was slow going from a plot point of view. Also, my 63 year old eyes had GREAT difficulty with the small print. I'm sure it was done to keep down the size of the book - it's over 1000 pages in paperback as it is - but it is very difficult to read. In addition to the small print, the pages are quite faint, making it even more difficult. Perhaps if the plot had been worth it, I might have persevered, but..."
4,Harry Who?,"I never ""got"" the Harry Potter thing. As a lifelong reader of Tolkein the appeal of a children's book about magic, however thick, eludes me. When I read the original reviews for this book in other media I was intrigued not by the comparisons to Harry Potter but by the substance of the book itself. I think that if the Harry Potter comparisons are marketing driven, they do a disservice to the author. This novel is much more mature, and more of an indulgence in language and character than any children's novel could hope to be. Perhaps some of the other 'adults' that are such fans of the children's fantasy genre ought to work their way up to grown up literature. Harry Potter is a good start, but the writen word is meant to inspire and entertain on its own. You dont need a thrill a minute. An English moor delivered by the pen of a competent author, and appreciated by a sophisticated reader are what literature is all about."
2,A very slow read,"Based on it being a number one bestseller and highly rated fantasy novel, I eagerly started this book. After about 200 pages, I wondered when the plot would start moving forward. Written like a historical narrative from the 1800s, it teases the reader to keep turning the pages but many of the payoffs are muted and felt like you're reading a history book. The overall story is interesting, but it takes about 650 pages to pick up the pace. The fantasy element is minimal, but it gives a good impression of an English magician in the 1800s."
3,I Wanted to Like this Book....,"I purchased this book based upon all the rave reviews it has been receiving. About 100 pages in I set it down and realized I had a hard time picking it back up again. Overall, this book took me an agonizing 3 months to finish. At about 500 pages in I thought to myself, ""I am really not enjoying this book at all, so why don't I just put it away?"" It is the rare book that makes me not want to finish reading it and this is one of them. However, I did finish it and must say it is very dull and plodding with too much description about boring details and not enough action! Also, the book is full of footnotes that are stories within themselves that I eventually did not bother to read anymore. I wanted to like this book, I really did. I suppose I've just read too many really great books that make this one so dull in comparison to them."
5,the gentleman with the thistle-down hair,"Recommended by a grad school literature professor, this book became a favorite before I had read even a hundred pages. Not merely a story but a universe of perpetually astonishing sophistication, complexity, and authenticity. I can only wonder how long Ms. Clarke must have inhabited this universe, plot points and characters weaving themselves in reveries at leisurely afternoon teas. I'd love for her write one of the peripheral books of magic (apparently fully realized in her mind) that play such an active role in the story... perhaps Lanchester's ""Language of Birds""?"
3,Wandering the King's Roads,"After wandering all the King's Roads, being shewn Every Possible Magic Phenomena No Matter How Tiny, and just when my eyelids were starting to close like flames being extinguished from a gaslamp, I finally cast a spell for myself of *Courage & Muster (*""Courage & Muster"" appeared in the 1135 publication of Lawrence Musseltree's The Reckoning of Things to Come) to give myself the strength to carry on. When one finally reaches the Tower of Immpenetrable Darkness the story does actually pick up and I truly did enjoy the ending. Even if it was a long, long, long journey."
3,Challenging to Finish,"I don't think this book can be called an adult Harry Potter. There is nothing similar except for the fact that they are both fantasies.The author created really good characters with their own quirks and ambitions. In some chapters, it is so fun to watch them interact. The author also sets up a tantalizing mystery that draws the reader in. After reading page after page, the book doesn't go anywhere! I felt so cheated that the author made me waste my time waiting for something to be revealed.This book is well written with great characters, but I can't take the slow pace for 800 pages! There is no payoff for the effort it takes to finish the book!"
5,Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell,"For those seeking a long engrossing book which is entertaining as well as being challenging to the intellect, I heartily recommend Susannah Clarke's Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norell. Yes, it is very long--a positive aspect for me, as it puts off the chore of finding another book--and it uses a style of language which some may find vexingly archaic. I LOVED it! Give me vexingly archaic any day, so long as it is flawlessly executed, which this is. A lively cast of characters, amusing anecdotes, and much vivid historical detail is only part of the charm--in addition, the author brings us a dark and Byronic--Lord Byron is actually a character in the novel--world within a world: the magical world of the Raven King. Not only engrossing but enchanting!"
2,Not for me,"I had greatly looked forward to the publication of this book. The early reviews made it sound like just the sort of work I would like. And the rave from one of my favorite authors (Palliser, author of ""The Quincunx) further whetted my appetite.I read and read and read before I finally gave up. I just don't see anything here worthy of merit. The characters are wooden and the plot all but non-existent.I would say that Ms. Clarke is a British Anne Rice--not a compliment in my book. Certainly she is no Rowling.Obviously many readers were greatly attracted to this book. I'm just not one of them. And whatever an amateur's opinion is worth, that's mine."
4,"Super book, poor ink","This book, Johathan Strange & Mr. Norrell: a Novel, delivers everything promised on the inside and back cover blurbs. Unfortunately, it is rather a physical trial to read in its standard paperback format. After all, it is 835 pages long, and the reader needs to constantly struggle to keep the pages both open and within the binding. The ink on my copy is very faint, and the print tiny. It's a challenge for both muscle coordination and eyes. I love a lengthy novel, the longer the better for me, but this book is set aside for the time being. I would rather have spent a bit more and gotten a larger bundle: large enough to contain all those pages comfortably and bright enough to read smoothly and easily, with a slightly larger font."
1,Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell,"This book stinks. From the start it was a hard slow read. It never took off and the characters were boring. PLEASE do not ever compare this book to Harry Potter there is no way it ever comes close to JK's great books. I bought the hardback version because I read the ""glowing"" reviews. Now I'd be glad to sell mine for $10 bucks and take the loss gracefully.Star"
1,I can't even describe how inflated the ego is.,"Here is my 5 theses regarding this horrid novelFirst, Clarke uses the plot mainly as a giant anticliche against all other fantasy booksSecond, She elaborates more on insignificant people by writing long footnotes that only stress your eyes with the sall printThird, She lacks good variety in character, and her style practicaly causes characters to contradict themselvesFourth, the story is MASSIVELY discursiveFifth, you say the writing is beautiful? Her style is very modern and, once again, discursive. She directly refers to and converses directly with the reader too infrequently, as well as writing rhetorical questions, prose of her own. Her style is a sad attempt to bring the book an antique feel to it, but I myself write like that, and I'm twelve...HER WRITING IS CHILDISH!Any good quality there may be is definitely overshadowed by the above."
1,Did you all actually read it?,"First off, I am an avid reader and love a long challenging read, however, this novel is one of the worst I have ever read! It is long, boring and has absolutely no plot. I purchased it when it first came out without reading any reviews. Although from the looks of most of them here, I personally suspect that many of those who raved, never actually read the book."
1,Somebody Help Me Read This Thick Book,"I bought this book used from Amazon for 99 cents - hard cover copy, too. Unfortunately, although it came highly recommended from a friend, I have yet to survive beyond the first chapter. The problem is this book is so enormous that it is impossible to bring on subways or planes. And at home I usually fall asleep before I can finish reading 10 pages (it is so heavy, it is even difficult to read in bed or on the couch!). The prose really takes a long time for one to get into. I've had it for months. I've since seen that the publisher has brought it out in 3 separate volumes. Better buy that one if you are the type who can't stand reading jumbo thick books. (Needless to say, I have never read ""War and Peace"")."
2,Tedious text,"I fell for all the positive hype and purchased this book expecting greatness. I was sadly disappointed. The characters were not that interesting really and the plot tended to drag, very heavily at times. An adult Harry Potter this is not nor is it a ""fantasy"" novel as most would expect. I plodded through the whole thing, determined to find what everyone liked about this book. I guess I missed it."
2,BOOOOOORRRRRING,"I kept thinking something would happen in this book but nothing every materialized. The best part of the book was the story at the end of the book, that had nothing to do with the main story, about the Raven King. If you like vanilla boring history books with no real hero or villain and no climax this is the book for you. Don't waste your time there are better books available."
1,If I could give it zero...,"I don't often bother with reviews, but this book is just so boring I feel compelled to type about it just to have gained some entertainment from it at all. I read a lot of books and this is only one of two books I've ever read in 25 years that I did not enjoy at all. I lost interest in it before I was half through it, but insisted on soldiering through it. It was so slow and dry it took me a full two weeks to finish it (though I can typically read a book this long in about three days).I let my sister borrow it with a warning that she wouldn't like it and she never finished it and is convinced I gave it to her to punish her for some insult she had paid me. It's a personal thing really, obviously plenty of people liked it. I honestly wanted to like it as well, but just couldn't."
1,Waste of money and time!!,Reading other reviews giving this 5 stars has become too much for me. I truly do not understand how anyone finished this book. The footnotes taking up sometimes overhalf the page made me feel like I was reading a research paper and not a very interesting one either. The best two words to describe this book are TEDIOUS and BORING!!! I read fiction for pleasure. There was no pleasure in reading a single page of this book. I did not finish it. I could think of no reason to continue to waste my time. I was not enjoying it or learning anything. I bought this based on reviews and wish I had saved my money.
1,Don't waste your money,"This book was absolutely horrible. I am a hugh fan of Harry Potter. JK Rowing creates a world of magic you can believe in and a main character that seems genuine, like a boy you could know. This book does none of the above. With a ridiculous amount of footnotes and a painful slow pace this author truly wasted my time. Don't let it happen to you."
2,What a bore!,"I agree with the last two posted reviews that this book was a huge disappointment. After reading some of the hype and reviews on Amazon, I thought I was in for a great fiction read that I would be hard pressed to put down. What a joke! I found it tedious, the footnotes irritating, and dull overall...I also did not get past page 150. Maybe I can sell on Ebay?"
2,A labor... not necessarily of love,"If it hadn't been for my strong determination to finish everything I start, I would have put this book down weeks ago. The first four hundred pages were soooooooo slow. I used to avoid the book, try to hide it somewhere and forget it, but this determination told me that I had to finish and know if it was worth the time. Having finished it last night I can say that it's a ""good book"". That's all I'd give it. Ask me in a month and I won't remember the plot nevermind the intricacies-- not exactly the stamp of a great novel. The last two hundred pages gripped me, I couldn't wait to turn the page, but did I really have to wade through 600 pages to get there? This book should have been edited to half its size... less is sometimes more. I wish someone had told Susanna Clarke that."
2,It is about magic but there is no magic in it,"Just a look at several different reviews and you get the idea - people either love that book or are bored to death. I honestly tried - and reached about half through before I decided that life was too short to spend it on this volume.There is no plot - really, there isn't. The so called ""well developed characters"" are indeed, well developed - at the very beginning, but after that they simply do not change that much. Nothing happens for pages and pages. I do admit that the language is beautiful and text-wise it is good work.But ""Lord of the Rings"" keeps you in its magic spell when you read it, or ""Big Fish"" or ""Time Enough For Love"" or LeGuin's EarthSea books. They all have magic. This one doesn't - even though it is written about it. I simply did not want to meet any of the characters again and for me that's enough reason not to finish the book."
3,I wanted to like it,"I am the kind of reader who begins one book, then puts it down and takes up another, and another, until I find one that I absolutely must finish reading. Sadly JS&MN is not that book. I have been reading it since September of last year and am only halfway through. It is rare when this happens. The premise of the book is wonderful, but the execution of the story is done with such a slow pace and dry writing style that I find myself putting it down after a few pages. Frustrating! Susanna Clarke is a talented author, there is no doubt about that, but I despair of ever being able to get to the last page of this disappointingly dull novel."
3,"Magically, Patience Prevailed","I usually never give a book this much time to get me involved. It was a gift from a well respected fellow reader. So I felt I had to give it the benefit of the doubt. I strongly urge those who wish to put the book down to continue. If once the first chapter in the Jonathan Strange section is finished, and you have not yet gotten into it, then put it down, but it gets much more interesting from here. The characters become more realized, and the historical and fantasy worlds are more fully defined. By the time I hit the last section, it was a page turner."
2,"Dreadfully Boring, Only Daffy Chimps Would Like This","This redefines the word 'piffle'. If you leave this book in a fishstore, floating goldfish in ten minutes. Save your braincells and avoid this trash. And if any 'wise' guy tries to enlighten you, slap him upside his mug with a cod! This could put Lunestra out of business."
5,Best book I read last year,"I see a low star count for this one. But I absolutely loved it. I read a heap of books last year and this one really struck me. It was admittedly a tedious book and demanded a little patience. But it drew me in and offered an incredible vision, cozy and subtle, dark and magical, lyrical and intelligent. A neat blend of high fantasy and real world. Politics and magic. Yes, you need patience for this read. But if you care for an emersive fiction with cobblestone streets, shadows, portals into other worlds, war, magic, and England, then this gem is the best you can get. If you need a fast-paced thrill ride, then you might want to wait until you're in the mood for something more moody. highly recommend this one!"
4,IF only it were formatted better,"I love this book, read it years ago and when it was published for the Kindle, immediately bought it and enjoyed reading it a second time. However, the Kindle edition has formatting (or something) problems. LOTS of typos, enough to be distracting, and an odd omission of the occasional word, also often enough to be distracting. I am tolerant of free Kindle books with typos and poor layout, but this one actually cost almost $9!"
5,All time favorite book,"I love this book-- if you like fantasy, but also regency/victorian period dramas, then this is it for you, the perfect creation. If you like either of these genres but NOT the other, then this is the perfect gateway to a whole new world! If you like neither of these genres, then WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU! TRY IT OUT RIGHT NOW. Seriously, take a chance. Give it a hundred pages. Once Jonathan Strange shows up in the story (who is possibly the most charismatic character ever created) then the book takes off at a gallop. Take a chance with it."
3,"A weighty endeavor to tote around, but overall, worth it!","This book was quite long - and it certainly had some slow moving parts (particularly in the beginning!). In fact, there were times that I regretted picking it up in the first place, but, I must admit, as the story drew on (and on!) it really improved. And the ending more than made up for the duller sections.My main complaint though was that the book was broken up into rather anecdotal chapters, which stole some of the cohesiveness of the book as a whole. That being said, there were definitely sections that I really liked - such as King George's and Lord Byron's ""guest appearances."" There were some unanswered questions, of course, but it was very fascinating premise and the amount of details alone were impressive. It certainly had a real epic quality."
3,Naruto Shippuden in Japanese,"The movie was very cool. But, to me at least, there is something missing when the American voice overs are missing. They give a quality to the character (inspiring or cheesy) that is hard to capture from well written subtext or cool animation. I would tell most people to wait until you are sure you get the English dubbed version of the movie if you don't speak Japanese--so much is happening in such a quick period of time that it is just too easy to want to choose reading vs. watching. And the Japanese inflection of words when speaking seems dull to the situation when you don't understand the language or cultural nuances presented."
2,Naruto shippuden movie 1,"Movie-Naruto ShippudenThis is not a knock on the movie itself. I knew it was engish sub-titled. The case I received that held the dvd looked like someone threw a naruto picture collage together. There were no ""special features"" and the quality of the video was subpar(like it was downloaded from the internet, burned and mass produced ). If you want to see the movie go ahead and get it, but If you want to watch a quality movie and think you're getting a company produced dvd that you would buy in a store you'll be dis-appointed and paying over $10 for this dvd would be a rip-off"
3,A let down,"I expected alot from this movie, probally too much, cause i love all things naruto, but i was reall let down. The characters just kind of complained back and forth to each other, the action was'nt that great, with the exception of rock lee's fight scene in it, which was pretty cool. I think i expected eveyone to have the 1 on 1 action scene the show use to have when they were younger, but overall the movie was just ok."
2,Eh!,Yea this movie is alright not worth buying tho in the whole movie there is only one good fight seen between rock lee and some guy that uses earth and fire justu
3,Is this movie dubbed into English?,"I rated this a 3 because the listing says that the movie is in Japanese language with English subtitles, but the coming soon was in English. Is the listing wrong and it is in both Japanese and English language? Someone please let me know. Or Amazon please update the listing to make it clear. Thanks."
3,Average Naruto film,"This film is average. I do like the action, but Naruto seems more childish than usual and the ending was not very good."
2,Keep the lids out of the dishwasher!,"I bought a lot of these containers in 4 different sizes. They are great if you do not put them in the dishwasher. The lids shrink just enough to make it extremely difficult to put them on the container, even when placed on the top rack of the dishwasher. The container seems to be OK but the lids do shrink. Luckily I realized this before it happened to all of them. Otherwise they are great containers but you need to hand wash the lids which is a big minus in my book."
5,Love it,"I have tons of these at this size. Perfect seal. The size is so useful for leftovers, carrying food for lunch etc. Love Rubbermaid quality."
4,Come to the shelter!!!!,I thought all the tracks were well put together except for the sound. I know its live but maybe they should have done a better Job with the Quality of the recording. Other than that If you are a true househead this is a must have. If you cant get to the shelter on saturday nights this is the second best. See yah at the shelter!!!
4,Shelter Anyone?,"I think Timmy has had better nights than this; Although the tracks are strictly Shelter tracks that makes you bump all night, the mixing was kinda of midiocre. Overall a must have cd for any shelter-heads out there"
3,Can't get the base ring unscrewed from the blender jar!,"I just got my Attrezzi blender (copper base with clear etched glass pitcher) today. I read the short user manual. I tried to unscrew the base ring from the pitcher so I can clean all the parts and have been unsuccessful. My husband even brought in one of those MasterGrip flexible wrenches that are a rubber strap. Still can't get the base ring to budge. If I could get the thing cleaned so I can use it, I might be able to rate this higher."
5,Pablo Neruda,"The poetry in this book is exquisite. The presentation is excellant. I own a copy of it, myself, and bought three more to give as gifts."
5,Simply so beautiful,"The coast of California, where Mary Heebner lives, is so parallel in its geography, blueness, and diverse forms of the shores from rocks to cliffs to wide sand to Neruda's mar at Isla Negra where he'd look out at that same Pacific ocean to form his poems. Mary is able to capture that intrinsic beauty of his sea and his poetry in this wonderful book of art. And you could ask for no better translator than Alastair Reid. Neruda loved how he'd walk barefoot all around his house and the beach at Isla Negra barefoot. And he loved his translations, as do I. Neruda said that ""to me, the ocean is an element like air."" This book of his poems about his sea, combined with the sublime blues of Mary Heebner's art, makes for such a great book for your coffee table, or as a gift, as I have given it now to six different people.--Mark Eisner, editor ofThe Essential Neruda: Selected Poems"
5,Neruda Poems,"I think Neruda is the most passionate poet I have read. There are many poets that have love and passion and pain and joy to write about, but Neruda does it with such ease. Reading his poems is like drinking a fine wine, his words warm you and for that brief moment you are alone with them you feel free and inspired. Unlike the wine though, Neruda's words linger with you days, months, years after you consume them. What a true work of written art!"
2,"Blah, Blah, Blah....","This book is set in japan about two boys who live near the sea. One day a ""big wave"" comes along and kills one of the boys parents and the boy whose parents were killed come to live with the other boy's family. They grow up and the orphaned boy marries the other boy's sister and they go and live on the beach where the orphan's parents used to live. THAT'S ABOUT IT. I consider this book to be mindless and confusing. You don't know if the author is talking about something the boys are doing at the moment or if the boys are recalling the past. I say a big no-no. But if you don't like reading, then you should read it because it is so short. It has about a moral or two which are good but could be expressed in a more exiting way. All that this book is is Blah, Blah, Blah..."
5,A lasting piece of literature,"I first read this book when I was 9 years old, and it has stayed with me for almost 40 years. It's a beautiful story of life, of loss, of resilience and hope. Recent events brought me back to this book, and it's a story I want to share with younger family members."
4,Great.,The Haunted Heart which was by one of my favorite authors Cherie Bennett was a excellent book. The ghost-love story was very interesting. The only thing that I didn't really like was how sometimes the author got off the subject. This was the first Enchanted Heart book I read and now I am on the 4th.
4,This is the SEXIEST game ever,"Ninja Gaiden is the best video game series of all time. The ones for original Nintendo will never be outperformed by any other game. The soundtracks on these games are awesome too, a must buy!"
5,An excellent study guide!,This book has 5 review exams with 200 questions each. It also provides rationale for the answers. It was very helpful.
5,Great prep for the test.,"I really like the way the book is sample tests with answer pages. The answers have a nice explanation of why it is the best choice. There are no ""all of the above"" type answers which I really like too."
5,Great Book,Great price for the item ! The book arrived in a reasonable time and was exactly as described. Will buy again.
5,Passed!,This book was highly recommended to me from classmates. Passed the Certification Exam so book is A.O.K in my eyes!
4,Pretty thorough but not the official test study guide -,"I bought thinking i would save some money on the actually NBCOT guide itself - while this book is all questions and answers (with reasoning why certain answers are not correct) its not the official study guide. Normally i wouldn't spend the $100+ on the NBCOT guide itself but with friends failing the test on the first try, and the fact that if your an AOTA.org member you get a discount on the book, (around $25 less than amzn) i thought it would be best if i just plunked down and got it -This book is very thorough with its type of questions, but i can see how once you go through each section you can pretty much memorize each answer, but overall this is a great guide, just not as in depth you want it to be especially for a $500 + test you only want to take once!"
2,CD-ROM Not Mac compatible,"Pro: The book includes 5 practice exams and answers with explanations.Cons: The CD-ROM would not load on my Macbook-- don't know about on a PC. Pay attention to other reviews that include warnings about the CD-ROM! You can still work through the questions the old-fashioned way with pen and paper. Also, beware-- this book is from 2002, so it may be outdated. Time for a 3rd edition with updated disk or web access to practice exams."
2,The COTA Examination Review Guide,"I felt the book was helpful, although the CD that came with it was not useable. First of all it was not packaged correctly. It came partially out of the package with very sticky glue on it and I had to clean it several times before I could even insert it into my drive. I contacted the F.A. Davis company for information on how to use the CD with Windows Vista and after several different attempts and numerous emails back and fourth, I still could not use the CD. The company stated they would send another CD that was compatable with my program but it never came. I am still waiting weeks later. When ordering any book with CD make sure there is information about program compatability. I will not order again without first inquiring further. I feel I should be able to return this book/CD because I did not get the full benefits I paid for."
3,Fallen Angels I,"Reminded me of the old black & white, ""Who Done It"". All stories were good, but ""Murder, Obliquely"" was my favorite."
4,"Good quality, could be a little sturdier","Bought Schlage to match up with our other sets in the house - this for our garage door. good quality you expect from this brand, but the handle is just a little ""loose"". All in all i'm happy, installed myself with ease."
5,Chuck Brown is the god father of go-go you must get it,Chuck Brown is the god father of soul. he has a way of making the groove flow smooth and put the boogie in your but. If you don't belive me listen to run joe
2,What happened...?!?!,"This is bad. I listened to it over and over again hoping that I was missing something, maybe it was good. Well, it's not. Don't torture yourself with this one, it's better to remember the Jesus Lizard that once was. Don't get me wrong there is some good material on here like 'Postcoital Glow' and some others, but the majority of it sounds like Van Halen meets Scratch Acid (which by all accounts sounds like it might be cool). And what the hell, you can actually understand what David Yow is saying...something is really, really wrong here. Buy their older stuff because they used to be incredible..."
3,They were better on Touch & Go,"The Jesus Lizard is one of my favorite bands. Unfortunately, once they signed to a major label, the quality of their albums decreased. ""Blue"" and ""Down"" those are albums. I would pick up their other albums first."
2,This is deceiving stuff,"I'm disappointed by this record. Where are those haunting guitars of HEAD, GOAT and DOWN? The 2 first tracks really suck, and the first half of the album is pretty weak. Plus they tried something different with much more melodies in the chorus of some of the songs of this album and on the 5 song EP that came out shortly before. I think it's a bad idea for them. David Yow just can't sing this type of song, plus it doesn't have the scary sound of the Jesus Lizard, which make them so incredible. The second half of the record is way better, but this album is easily their weakest effort. So be sure to listen to it before buying it. In my opinion, it's not worth having."
3,Underated,This album is a real mixed bag. It's nothing compared to the older stuff but the reviews it got were unfair. Alot of the songs really hold up.
4,"Nice, but way over priced.","I bought these for jogging, and they are nice, but too expensive honestly. Also as a side note for you guys... the pouch that is built into the product might just provide a bit too much of a bulge in certain clothing, so be aware of how it looks before you step outside if you catch my drift..."
2,Love Adrienne Rich...but she needs to stick to poetry,"This autobiography reads like the rantings of a woman who just needs to buck up and get over it. YES, motherhood is difficult (HELLOOO), and YES you have to submit your own individual needs, wants, and desires for those of your children. The book revealed to me the utterly selfless love that Rich apparenly doesn't possess. I wonder how her children feel as they read it."
4,Alzheimer,"If a love one has Alzheimer, this is the book to read. It was consoling and helped me to understand the disease. I highly recommend. Thank you"
5,Excellent,The item was exactly how was displayed and briefed. The cologne smells wonderful and wood definitely purchase this item again.
1,Definitely not genuine,"The price on this seemed too good to be true, and that is the case. This is not the same color as my previous bottle and does not have the same scent. I gave it to my teenage son, because I didn't want to bother with a return (and the box was open). I don't recommend this particular purchase, even though this is my favorite scent."
5,Fantastic fragrance!!!,I received a sample from my sister and both my husband and I were pleasantly surprised. This is a wonderful soft fragrance that lasts the majority of the day! I bought it as a Christmas present for my husband and he loved it!
3,nice but doesnt last...,I must say that either> Amazon is selling fake perfums or... this fragrance is just plain eau... cause once you apply over the skin it the smell fades very very quickly.
4,LOVE IT!!,"I bought one of these in another style before I had the baby and this one afterward because I loved them soooo much. The blanket is very very soft (minky)and thick. The blanket binding is cotton, not satin, but, I liked that feature and it does hold up after being washed many times. I only gave this four stars instead of five because it is *just* a few inches too short. If it were just slightly bigger, I don't think I would use another blanket honestly."
4,validating and inspiring,"The Box set offers a pile of practical advice and insight. For many it will be validating in that it offers information that you already know you are doing well. The tips also cover both sides of situations, the advice is balanced, so can sound contradictory (much like life!)."
3,Nice Girls Don't Get... Corner Office/Rich,"I think that, in packing in too much (and fairly mundane) information, the author fails to provide much depth to her assertions. I also think she talks down to her audience."
2,Advice to get ahead,"What I listened to was interesting. But it is so long that I have yet to get through the CD's.If you have a lot of time, maybe it's worth it."
2,READABILITY,"I wish one of the reviewers would have mentioned the 'readability' factor. At my age, I look for a font and setup that are readable. Some of this old stuff is actually 19th century editions that are simply photocopied. I hate that. It is a major issue with me because I buy so many books on Amazon. When they include the ""Look Inside"" feature, I can tell immediately if it is a setup that I like. Unfortunately, this book does not offer that feature. My guess is that Norton Classics will be OK in this regard but I am still taking a chance."
5,out of this universe...,"I fell madly in love with Splashdown through the influence of a SF-dj friend of mine, and nearly cried when the band broke up. So glad to see Melissa Kaplan is still putting her brilliance to work in Mercury. Stand out tracks are: Solar/Lunar- which would fit happily on Space Mountain or the Serenity soundtrack, Six-step dragon- an absolutely beautiful synth-asian peice, and Dragonfly.A word of caution:As with the case of much of Splashdown's stuff, you may not like this music the first time you hear it. It's very dissonant, oddly unlike what western ears are trained to hear. KEEP LISTENING. After the 3rd time through the album, you will start to pick out the marvelous subtleties in the music."
5,addictive,"I bought UHP on the back of Splashdown and was prepared to be disappointed, but was pleasantly surprised to find the album diverse and brilliant. Dragonfly was familiar from the free downloads on the UHP website and stands out as one of the best songs, however there are many to choose from with Avatar and Tutellary Genius being my personal favourites. The blend of upbeat pop and eastern influences with bluesly ballads makes a wonderfully addictive album and while I think all splashdown fans will always hope for a reunion, UHP undoubtedly makes the separation easier to bear.The only track i havent loved is quiet use of charm, although it seems to be popular with many other people, i find the vocal effects a little irritating and with a voice like that there really isnt any need for them!Overall a throughly recommended and enjoyable cd."
3,Ruined By Slow Gameplay,EAST FRONT is historical turn based strategy game where you can choose between being the wermacht or the red army. The great thing about EAST FRONT is its attention to historical detail. When the wermacht invade the USSR they`re supplied by horse and carts and have panzerwagen mark 3s` as their main battle tanks. When you change the settings to 1944 they`re supplied by trucks and have the infamous panthers and tigers as their tanks while the Soviets have T34s`.If it`s such a well researched game why three stars ? The big problem is the very poor game speed. A battle sceanario may take two or three days to play 17 turns . EAST FRONT features the battle of Stalingrad and contains literally hundreds of units but it takes so long waiting for the AI to move these units you eventually start losing intrest in the outcome.So Talon Soft please improve the AI if you want to bring out a brillant second game
1,Abyssmal,This is close to being as deplorable a game as I have ever seen.A true abomination of a software.
2,"The horror, the horror ...","I'm sure that there was a lot of hard work put into this album, and it breaks my heart to tell that it was for nothing ... Well actually not for nothing, this CD will sale nicely but if you appriciate good and creative R&B; stay away from this CD like Michael Jackson from the sun.All the songs sound the same ... even the beat is the same ... and it's allright cause ""Grindin'"" is quite nice but why should I listen to another 14 ""Gridin's"" ?I see pepole reccommend ""In search of"" by the NERD ... now thats a good CD! maybe you should spend your money on that CD instead of this one and if you must take two so take the amazing ""Clones"" album by the Neptunes.Good Day."
1,Terrible,"from all of the reviews and advice of friends I expected the meaning of life to come out of this cd, but it was terrible. I haven't heard such a bad rap album since well, ever. I wouldn't suggest this one to anyone unless you need something to burn to keep warm."
3,mediocre,"When i first got it, i bought it for ""When The Last Time"", and i hated ""Grindin'"" and i still hate ""Grindin'"" becuase of the beat on it..I like ""Cot Damn"", the vocals are good on it... but the cd is average to me now... i no longer like it as much as i once did... it got old fast...if you wanting to buy it, pay under $10 for it... sorry if this review isn't helpful to you, but there ain't much i can say about it... but check out other cd's they are on or their other songs, ""What Happened To That Boy"", and the artist Birdman."
4,Clipse - Lordwillin',"Clipse had an excellent debut album with hits such as ""Grindin'"" and ""When the Last Time"" to set it off. The beats, which were produced by the Neptunes, are outstanding but the lyrics are average. Malice and Pusha T do not have great voices, and somewhat wasted these excellent beats that they were given. They could've used more guest appearances to improve their marketing and performance. Yet this album comes together as a pretty good one, especially for a debut, with a variety of great songs on it.top tracks:1-grindin'2-comedy central (f. fabolous)3-let's talk about it (f. jermaine dupri)4-virginia5-when the last time"
4,Somewhat disappointing,"Although this is a solid album, I was somewhat disappointed as I thought some of the production was not up to the Neptunes' standards. Still, a good album overall. Grindin and When the Last Time have been played a lot, but are still two of the better tracks on the album. Young Boy, Virginia, Famlay Freestyle, Comedy Central, I'm Not You, and the two Grindin remixes are top tracks. I though Cot Damn was a good song, but the chorus is awful and kills the song for me. I didn't like Ma, I Don't Love Her, Ego, Let's Talk About It, or Gangsta Lean. The Neptunes do all the production while NORE, Roscoe P. Goldchain, Famlay, Fabolous, Jadakiss, Styles, Lil Wayne, Sean Paul, and Kardinal Offishall all make solid guest spots. Overall, a good album but I think it could have been better."
4,Neptunes needed more effort but.....,"All in all, this album is a nice debut for clipse. Neptunes laid down some pretty good tracks which could have been done better. i enjoyed the three singles "" grindin"", ""when's the last time"" and ""ma, i don't love her"", which just came out. Some of the cameos stunk but overall were decent. too many grindin remixes which shouldn't have made the cut. definately an album worth checkin out."
4,Bangin',"I have never been a huge fan of the Neptunes, although I do think they are very innovative (especially on the N.E.R.D. disc) but this cd shines with great beats and even better lyricism. ""When The Last Time"" is one of the best club songs I have ever heard and one of the better tracks of the year, mixed in with the ghetto anthem ""Grindin"" and the hard hittin crank it up sounds of ""Hot Damn"" and perhaps the best produced track on the cd ""Virginia"" which u will never tire of....there are some other hot songs on this disc that will make ya head nod...however the song with Jermaine Dupri and one or 2 others limit this album too a 4 stars keeping it from classic status....pick up this cd if u wanna chill and smoke to ""gangsta lean"" or get ready for the club with ""when the last time"".peace, JP"
3,"The Neptunes are Great, The Clipse suck.","The neptunes produced great beats for a rap group that is uninspiring, with the exeption of When's the Last Time, there are no great lyrics from this Virginia based group and that song is also greatly helped by the sizzling beat. Also helping the Clipse wher appearances by the great Fabolous, Sean Paul, Kardinal Official, the Lox and others. This Cd is good to test your car's bass and nothing else really."
4,good cd,"great beats.. good lyrics.. but i dont like how they have 3 versions of grindin. its sorta annoying.. keep it to two.i like their newest cd ""hell hath no fury"" more, but i still reccomend this!"
3,"Just Gridin' Yall, Never Mind Them","First of all, I like to start off saying that this album has one of the best production by the Neptunes to back it up. Now to the album, Malice and Pusha T has decent rhymes, only that it was poorly displayed. Lyrics sounds repetitive, otherwise these guys have great flow. The guest apperances are pretty good too. But besides the 3 singles (Ma, I don't Love Her, WHen's The Last Time, Grindin) this album does not have any catchy songs. Unlike other mainstream rappers (Jay-Z, Eminem, DMX, Snoop Dogg), the Clipse's CD does not have any other jams besides the radio joint. Otherwise t his CD would be much improved.Deliver: B-Lyrics: BProduction: AOverall: B+"
3,sub par tracks bring down a strong debut,"clipse burst on to the scene with grindin', the song that truly opened everyone's ears to the neptunes. dont give me any bs about any other songs showing the neptunes off...because the grindin made you stop, think, and ask ""who the hell is this?""track ratings1. 32. 23. 54. 55. 46. 17. 48. 4.59. 3.510. 2.511. 312. 3.513. 4.514. 3.5OVERALL 3.5...but the bad songs bring it down to a three in my mindsthis is hardly a cd you can listen to from start to finish. though there are some spectacular beats...the neptunes originality doesn't always fit the flows the clipse has. the fact that ""ma i dont love her"" was released as a single is horrible, considering they never released ""virginia"" (the beat that is at the end of the grindin video) that is the best track on the cd.best tracks - grindin, virginia, when the last time, i'm not you w/ jadakiss.download the spectacular tracks, dump the rest"
3,Tight but not what I expected,"This album is good because of the neptunes. Clipse aren't that good of rappers. My favorite songs are cot damn, gridin', and When the last time. This album is Club bumber not a Street Shaker."
5,Freakn' Great,"Well, first of all, it's made with the Neptunes so you know it can't be bad. This definitly isn't bad, in fact it's great. If you like the song Grindin', you'll like pretty much the rest of the CD. There are 15 songs and 12 or 13 are great, the other s are about averave, but none of the songs are bad. The beats are great the lyrics are great if you don't mind massive, pervasive drug references. Anyway, I recommend this CD to anyone who likes rap music in general."
