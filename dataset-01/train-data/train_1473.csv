5,the end of days,"Mesmerizing, well researched, and impossible to put down, Ruppert crosses the rubicon of contemporary belief and lays out his prose in a clear, concise manner. He names the names and attaches it to historical events that may or may not be well known. Impossible to put down, read it at your own risk of comfort and weep."
5,Buy this book for your elected/unelected representatives!,An excellent and well researched book that peers into the gutters of the American Empire. Give this book to anyone that considers themself an American...this is a great litmus test!
5,Crossing The Rubicon,"For those who want a factual,well researched blow by blow of 911,this is the book for you. at over600 pages its still a page turner."
2,Whinning gossip distorts his teachers,"This is an entertaining book with a rare inside look at real Work groups, but unfortunately not the look you would want. Kherdian does the same kind of injustice to John Pentland that another reviewer reports he does to Ms. Stavely. Read the other review for his distortion of Stavely. Members who were in the same group with Kherdian under John Pentland tell a different slant to Kherdian's account. Kherdian is preserving his ego with this book and rejecting the efforts of his teachers precisely at the point where it could do him the most good. When it starts getting personal, he can't handle it. This book does an injustice to unsuspecting readers who might think this is an honest and accurate account. They may find themselves unnecessarily discouraged. There is little real school available in the world as it is without undermining what little there is. If Kherdian couldn't give a fair account, he should have kept his mouth shut."
1,"book by Gurdjieff's ""grandson""","The author blows his credibility right from the start by trying to call himself a grandson of Gurdjieff!The contents of the book are just not worth reading - unless you like pure fiction - or a good laugh.Why call yourself somebody's ""grandson"" if in fact you are not related to the person concerned?"
1,It really is for only 1 plate- beware! This is a scam.,"This item was listed with a normal price of $69 and was discounted to about $8. Yeah, I read the description that indicated a quantity of ""1"", but often this describes a bundle of 1, or the like. No, in this case it really meant just 1 plate. Seriously? Who would order 1 plate? A single plate has a value of less then $1. Silly me for thinking I was getting a good deal, but Amazon should be embarrassed to list this as an 80% savings over the normal $69 price. Sent it back and I'll go to Lowes and get a bundle of them for about $10. Good thing there is a return policy. Amazon needs to take this item off their listing."
2,I wanted to like this book,"The subject matter was absolutely compelling, and I couldn't wait for the book to arrive. But, alas, whatever the author was trying to say got lost in the disjointed writing. It lacks a trajectory of meaningful analysis."
3,Great subject,"There was a hilarious post on Metafilter about medieval marginalia that brought me to this subject. Apparently, some calligraphers would kvetch in the margins about how their hands hurt, how boring their job was, etc. Very funny, when you consider how solemn the context was. You just don't (or at least I don't) picture people of that era in such a pedestrian way.However, this seller sold me a ridiculously marked up copy with underlining on every page- obviously it belonged to an art history student or something. Kinda pissed me off."
3,painful,"I had to read this for a class. This is not for anyone unless you are searching for strict information. Camille manages to give countless astute observations that would be very helpful in building up a paper. But as historical book unto itself that guises itself as text interpreting Medieval Europe through rebellious artwork, it just doesn't hold much water. The confines here are soooooo narrow that unless you have already a great passion for artwork of this period you will be left quite numb."
3,Think first before you buy it,"It sounds like a good system with low cost -- Dolby digital surround sound system, 5.1 channel, optical digital input, etc.However, you have to buy a DVD player to set up the whole system. The subwoofer works well, but the satellite speakers ... a lot. They sound just like my $... desktop speakers. It seems that Aiwa wants to play a good sound solely by enhancement of a subwoofer. Even the center speaker needs to be improved much before it is put on the market.So don't expect this system can generate some special effects like that Bose, pioneer could make. Just check your pocket and think about it first before you want to buy such a system."
4,Great value and name,I'm a complete newbie when it comes to home theatre systems. I've owned Aiwa products before so their name and the price were my main reasons for buying this system. Both movies and DVD's sound amazing on this system. My only complaint has been that the user guide doesn't clearly explain the set-up and some of the options.
1,canopy enclosure kit,The product was incomplete. There were no poles to put it up with nor instructions as to what size poles to get if you wanted to put it up
3,Pretty bad,"I can't believe Michener would ok this project if it was supposed to be the film adaptation of his book ""Texas"" which was excellent. This is pretty bad, it is only saved by the stunning Maria Conchita Alonso but she is not in the whole thing."
5,Great movie,This film is a wonderful way to tell the history of our nation. Enjoyed the movie. The film was purchased and received in a very timely manner. Thx
3,Texas,"While this book had some good story telling, the characters were not very well defined. Towards the end, it seemed he was just writing the story to get it over w/& to include as much history as he could in one place. Didn't seem very historically accurate. I also watched the movie of the same name/author & it was absolutely terrible."
5,TEXAS,"We are original orginal of this video and have watched it on tv once an then this set.It is one of the best movies we havd seen on the Alamo and the start of Texas as a independant State.Charle Heston really done a great job in his naration.It is a solid 3 hr movie with lots of action, love story and other things that make it great.I highly recommend seeing it, you will not forget it."
3,goth rock,"A little different to the heavy stuff I listen to, but this is a good cd anyways. Got some cool techno vibes thrown in with some dark lyrics. Not real heavy, just all around gothic"
5,The Long Wait is Over...,"The sophmore release from south Florida's DSA is so much better than the self-titled as Dearborn(Vocals, Orchastrated Mayhem) actually recorded with the band: The Dro(Bass), Mubo(ex-member/Keyboards), DreGGs(Guitar), and Cygnus(Drums). This album was surprisingly a lot heavier than their first. It really captured their stage presense. I definetely recommend for any person in the DSA Army. FCUK HATERS!"
4,Low budget creative and alternative take on the Bosnian Conflict,This is an interesting factional piece that presents an alternative creative story set to the back drop of the complex Bosnian crisis. Low budget but I loved the energy and dramtaic components of the story - all good independent film stuff!
2,The Exact Opposite,"The first single from overblown baby diva Jessica Simpson's similarly titled sophomore effort bows to all the trends of the current radio landscape. While the song isn't bad by a longshot, it's far from the best song on her album(try 'Hot Like Fire' or 'A Little Bit), and the So-So Def Remix actually detracts from the original's appeal(it's actually laughable)--she needs to quit trying for street cred and focus on finding some good songs to distinguish her sound. Also disappointing is the Hex Hector remix--usually highly reliable, this ranks among his worst and most uninspiring reworkings to date. All in all, a wise purchase only for die-hard fans."
2,EXPECTED BETTER,"WAS THERE EVER A MORE FABULOUS, TALENTED PERSON THAN LINDA MCCARTNEY? PROBABLY, BUT YOU WOULDN'T KNOW IT FROM THIS PUFF PIECE. EVEN THOUGH AT TIMES THE MCARTNEYS WERE ASKING FOR IT WITH THEIR ACTIONS (WOULD PAUL HAVE DEEMED BIANCA JAGGER BANGING A TAMBOURINE AND SINGING OFF-KEY AN INNOCENT TALENT?), SHE WAS HARSHLY JUDGED FOR YEARS. NOW WE HAVE QUOTES FROM PEOPLE THAT HAD PREVIOUSLY KNOCKED HER, BUT WITH HER DEATH, AS SO OFTEN HAPPENS, SHE HAS TAKEN ON A ROSY GLOW. THE REAL LINDA, WHO OBVIOUSLY HAD A INTERESTING, ALBEIT HUMAN, LIFE, LIES SOMEWHERE IN IN BETWEEN. HE NOTES IN THE FOREWORD THAT THE BOOK COULD NEVER HAVE COME TO PASS WITHOUT PAUL MCCARTNEY'S ""GREEN LIGHT"". TOO BAD THE AUTHOR FELL BACK ON HIS PUBLICITY BACKGROUND AND WROTE SOMETHING THAT COULD HAVE COME STRAIGHT FROM MPL PRODUCTIONS. REAL PEOPLE DESERVE BETTER."
1,Not the nicest tribute ever....,"Not the nicest tribute ever.... The author speculates endlessly about Linda's opinions & motivations - pulling Paul into the picture as much as possible for effect. Having been, admittedly, just an acquaintance of the McCartney's and a one-time friend of Linda's, that's the best he can do. When he writes about Linda directly, he comes across as petty & mean. This book saddened me more than anything else."
5,The Real Linda McCarntey,"This book is the definitive portrait of an amazing woman, and was written with Paul's blessings.Danny & Linda were very close friends. He writes this story with love & integrity ( & with Paul's blessings).If you want to know what Linda was really like, and get a glimpse of the sixties from someone who was there, this is the book.The world is a better place for Linda McCartney having been here."
2,No,"I actually didn't read this book, but read parts of it in a bookstore that let bums like me read books without buying them, and didn't end up buying the book because the author is a bit TOO eager to let the reader know that he had personal contacts with the McCartneys. Not that that in itself is a sin, but he's so darned SMARMY about it! Ugh! The author of Paul McCartney's authorized biography MANY YEARS FROM NOW, Barry Miles, knows Paul McCartney probably as well, if not better, than Fields knows/knew Linda and Paul. But very very rarely through that much thicker book does Miles mention his personal relationship with Paul. A better book than this one."
3,"lacking, but interesting","There is so little out there on Linda McCartney that I'm glad to get some insight into the wife of Paul McCartney: rock photographer, band member (Wings), mother of four, and animal rights activist. However, author Danny Fields uses lots of filler, not enough meat (or as Linda would prefer: soy burger). Fields was good friends with Linda before she started seeing Paul, but Linda didn't maintain contact with the author or other New York journalist friends after becoming serious with the cute Beatle. Though her friendship with Fields may have suffered after Linda became caught up in the wirlwind post-Beatles break-up, the author has high regard for Mrs. McCartney and seems to be in awe of all that she accomplished, both professionally and personally."
4,What a Loss . . .,"Yes, fantastic! This book was written by a friend of hers, so it tended toward a favorable telling, but it did not hold back from examining her failings as well. Two come to mind: not being good at staying in touch and then just, poof, calling or showing up one day years later and (worse) reaching a point in her status where she expected others to come to her. But overall, she sounds like a great person--warm and empathic, a good wife and mother, a champion of animal rights and vegetarianism, a superb photographer, and a musician who grew into the role. Paul is portrayed at the unfailingly charming one who could work a room, but one-on-one it was her kindness that one remembered. Her premature death by breast cancer at age 56 was quite a loss to those who knew her. Far from being the woman who tore the Beatles asunder, it was she who nursed Paul through his serious depression after they broke up. Compare her story to Heather Mills', and see who comes out ahead . . ."
4,Enjoyable biography,"Yes, this book was light and fluffy, but I enjoyed it still. Very readible and obviously written with affection for the subject, Danny Fields has little negative to say about anyone (although he had the opportunity). This is so refreshing after the Goldman trash book and Barry Miles' ""Many Years from Now."" Contrary to other opinions voiced here, I really got to feel that I knew Linda, and the experience opened my eyes since previously I did not know much about her.I recommend this to anyone intersted in a good bio on Linda McCartney."
3,this album is okay,the only songs i liked are bout it bout it and the little sample of the ice cream beat.you know its funny if you put it in your car and play it back and forth.i did it and people thought i was the real ice cream man.plus my friends in the car were laughing
5,Master P rules but I am the real ice cream man,"i think this cd is hella cool but the only song that i really listen to is mr. ice cream man cuz of the remix it has from "" turn off the lights "" and that is a classic old school song i really like this song i listen to it a lot and i also like song #9 cuz it rules and #13 cuz it is the second best song next to Mr. ice cream man"
4,This CD is a ground breaker.,"With all of the decked out beats and sounds on this album, i believe the trio of Master p, bun b, and pimp c on the song titled break em off somethin is definetely the tightest track on the album. In fact that one song would cause me to purchase the album ya know."
3,This cd is cool,"This cd is cool, it is a must have if u are a no limit fan tracks 2, 5, 13 and 12 are the best."
1,so whack,"i wish there was a no star option.master p is so whack , hes not an mc. this is what the public thinks hip-hop is and thats why its so criricized. real mc's need to be heard such as krs-one , black thought(the roots),common,organized konfusion , blackstar ,etc, and as far as master p being original , its the same old thing , money , cars , girls, ni**a this,ni**a that.do yourself and hip hop a favor and don't buy this or any other master p album."
1,I liked Master P... But he puts down wemon!!!,I used to like him... after Iheard this CD I changed my mind... he was vulgar and distasteful. I've heard that he's a Christian... how can someone act like that and say the things he says and call himself a Christian!!! As far as I'm concerne this CD and everything else of his is S***!!!
4,master p got it going on,If you want a cd done very well by a talented brother this is the cd you want to pick up. It has bomb as beats and rythum.
2,"Even if you're a fan of the label, you'll be let down","Funny how Master P's oldest material is his worst. This album is over 1:20 minutes long and with 20 tracks, you'd think there would be more decent music than the result would have it. Pretty much after the first 3 tracks, the album goes downhill. A few other good songs later on the album, but with less than half out of 20, that's not a good set of odds. I recommend avoiding purchase of this album. Especially if you don't like rap. A great deal of the material to be found here is completely tasteless."
1,"Disgusting, Stupid, Stereotypical Lyrics..","Why cant someone in Hip Hop put out a phat, bubblegumless album that doesnt have lyrics that involves drugs, murder, or disrespecting women? The music is jumpin in this one, but I want to slap MasterP for some of the things he had on this album. For example, what is up with that fill-in track that has him having oral sex? Just let me hear that joint ""Bout It Bout It"" and turn the rest of that crunk off!"
3,Worth while for an enthusiast,If you are a train lover and wish to have an overview of some of the trains in Florida then this might be for you. I think it missed out on an opportunity to introduce the non-enthusiast to trains. There were lots of opportunities to go just a little deeper on the routes and models of locomotives in the footage. The video is better suited for someone who knows locomotives and the train routes of Florida.
1,Dumb book not bunnies,This has to be one of the most disappointing children's books I've ever seen. The book isn't creative or silly. It's just plain dumb. Worse yet it's full of bad examples and shows children that acting like an idiot is fun. Have fun with the children raised on this book. They're going to be geniuses.
4,It's sooo silly,My niece and nephew love this book. It is sooo silly. Dave Pilky is great. The kids are glued to the story because they know something really silly is coming. Now whenever they do something wacky I call them a dumb bunny and they know exactly what I mean. Just plain fun.
5,Funny Story,"I got this book for my nephews and they loved it. It is a funny story and it not only entertains the children, but it entertains the adults."
4,Great for Adults Too!,"My boyfriend gave me this book for Valentine's Day and it makes me laugh every time. These bunnies are very silly and they do everything wrong but there is something truly sweet and endearing about this family. This book also has a wonderful way of expressing the silliness kids love. Both of these points are beautifully illustrated when Baby Bunny pours his porridge down his pants and Poppa Bunny exclaims ""That's My Boy!"""
2,Not clever or creative,"My children and I love silly humor, but this book is just lame. The good books of this type have at least a little imagination.Summary of story:The story of Goldilocks and the Three Bears except there are rabbits instead of bears. They pour the porridge into their underwear. They flush Goldilocks down the toilet.Not clever or creative at all. My five year old chuckled a little on the first read. The book is going to goodwill. Thank goodness I bought it for 25 cents."
3,Too Technical,"This book is way too technical for the average reader. If you are a professional, then you should check it out. I'm not really sure if it would be helpful since I'm not a professional, but the book really analyzes every aspect of performance in snowboarding. It is not too enjoyable if you are not that into snowboarding and even if you are, you would not probably want to read it. Pictures are nice, though."
5,Eye-opening read,"Although I grew up less than an hour from Salem (and took the obligatory school trips there as a kid), I really knew very little about the witch trials until I stumbled upon Bernard Rosenthal's Salem Story. The author's extensive research and enjoyable narrative made for an excellent read. Simply put, I learned a lot and I'm glad I read the book."
4,Very Informing,"I have to do a research paper for a college class I'm taking. I chose to do my paper on The Salem Witch Trials, and after buying this book, I must say that it has given me correct, and in-depth information that is far better than the information I could find online.This is the book to read if you want the factually accurate truth about Salem.(on a side note, it's can get to be a little slow in parts because every detail is explained, so if you want exciting stories about witches, you're better off with Harry Potter)"
2,I had Professor Rosenthal at the University of Binghamton,"While taking his course at Binghamton and forced to read Salem Stroy, I found his words boring. While I must give him credit for doing a tiredless amount of research on the subject of the Salem Trials, I still found that he took an interesting subject that has been a memorable part of American history and made it unfascinating. I don't recommend this book to anyone who doesn't have to read it, but if ever, you must know the facts to a fictional marvel, read first 59 pages of this book."
2,"Blah, Blah, Blah, Blah","All I have to say is that this book is VERY hard to stay interested in. I have always found any/all information on the Salem Witch Trails to fascinating...until now! This book is very factual, but seems that it is very repetitious. I think a book CAN be factual and keep ones attention (which is why I purchased the book) but unfortunately, I found this book completely boring."
4,Witch trials,I found this boof to be very well written and to the the point. I was very into it the intire time i was reading which is abnomal for me. Sorry this is all new for me. This is my first time for this.
2,"Blah, Blah, Blah, Blah","All I have to say is that this book is VERY hard to stay interested in. I have always found any/all information on the Salem Witch Trails too fascinating...until now! This book is very factual, but seems that it is very repetitious. I think a book CAN be factual and keep ones attention (which is why I purchased the book) but unfortunately, I found this book completely boring. It seems that I am not the only one that thinks this way from other reviews."
4,Spirited soundtrack,"In 30 words or less...Memorable songs, spirited and exciting to be sure. The beautiful Irish themes woven seamlessly throughout. A WDWCP alumni must!"
4,Interesting soundtrack,"The CD is lovely to listen to. The two Rzeznik songs are terrific, and the lyrics from ""I'm Still Here"" really capture what growing up can feel like for many of us, the thoughts and emotions. I like listening to the score quietly with my eyes closed and my own imagination going. So, I ended up liking both parts of this CD, the rock songs and the score."
2,Case Damaged,"Although the CD played, as I was told it would, I was dismayed to discover that the case was badly damaged and cracked. This is to the point that I worry when opening it that it will just finish breaking in half. I believe that this information should have been disclosed in the product description so I could have made an informed buying decision."
3,Treasure Planet's A Sinking Ship,"While the opening track on this cd 'I'm Still Here' gives promise, it unfortunately falls flat. The song is a little bland and not quite catchy enough. However, 'Always Know Where You Are' delivers more of a punch. This song leaves you with a positive feeling and is definitely my favourite.Tracks '5' and '6' are nicely composed too...I'd recommend this soundtrack to John Rzeznik fans only."
4,One of Howard's best,"James Newton Howard never ceases to amaze me. Time and again, his scores bring life and emotion to films that are somewhat devoid of such necesseties. With ""Treasure Planet,"" Howard uses his unmistakable talent to give us a score that is both exciting and gentle, sweeping and sublime. This one goes up on my shelf with ""Atlantis,"" ""Dinosaur,"" and ""Sixth Sense"" as another great work by one of film music's most talented composers.And to the person wondering where the Trailer music was, I believe that piece was actually from a John Williams score, I think ""Far and Away,"" but I could be mistaken. Remember that 99% of all film trailers do NOT use music from the films they advertise."
5,Great Johnny Rzeznik,I didnt know that I'm Still Here comes from this film .... and I am so excited to actually see it and I need to buy this CD right after I finish writing my comment. If not for Johnny Rzeznik I would not even know about the film .... the song I'm Still Here is sooooo great that I just need to buy the CD and see the film.
4,Biased book,"They have some good stuff in here, but in terms of writers included they have missed some of the greats, such as Gorky. But includes some of the lesser-knowns like Babel."
4,Review of Russian Stories,"This is a very useful learning tool, with translation provided page by page.It is a sound introduction to the writers from Russia's golden age of literature.Of course, it is not a book for beginners."
4,"Good, but not for beginners","I'd recommend this for someone who has around 100h of effort studying Russian. Before that one will probably lack the basic skills for recognizing declined words, or to understand the distinctions between the aspects of verbs. At that point, one will probably have enough knowledge to be able to fill in gaps of understanding and still learn."
3,A bit complicated for me...,"I think Russian people are not used to publish ""adapted"" books for students as Penguin does. Let's say, I bought many titles in English (e.g. Shakespeare, Edgar Allan Poe) with 1,000 words, 700 words for my students, etc depending on the level. This book is very nice, but I think the stories were not adapted for students. I can't read it. I can speak Russian and of course I can read it...but it is maybe for very advanced students. I can't read it right now.Martin, frustrated"
4,VERY FINE RECORDING,"I bought this as a present for a friend, so I haven't unwrapped it. However, I did listen to a sample before buying it. This gentleman has a very fine voice and a learned and sensitive style of performance. Anyone who is interested in great singing will like this album. It is also very encouraging to me to find that Black men are becoming a presence in classical singing."
1,Try something else,"I was trying to save money with this item. Bad idea. It's much smaller than the Panasonic version (much less on the roll) and sticks to the paper coming out of the fax machine. Basically, it's unusable."
1,Wrong Product Ships,"Should've read other reviews. Received a cheap Pocket Lint Brush instead of what is pictured and described. Unlike previous reviewer, I am returning and will update afterwards."
1,Looks absolutely NOTHING like the picture,It would be too much trouble to send back but this is the worse thing I have ever ordered from Amazon. The item I received is a tiny little brush about the size of a comb and it folds. There are no bristles like shown in the picture and it barely brushes the sleeve of a sweater. DO NOT BUY THIS! It is completely bad representation from Smartek.
5,No more schnauzer fur!,"As the gray started coming in, my hair became wiry and so thick it was virtually uncontrollable. Finally I chopped it off and unfortunately resembled some sort of terrier with a wiry coat (not good for self-esteem in my late 40's). I tried numerous products over the past several years and finally was able to stop searching when I found Te Tao (Metal) Moisturizing Shampoo and Conditioner. My hair became softer and more manageable right away; continued use has only made it better."
1,pure waste of money,"I purchased a euphonium from this company, and the valves are useless and do not even move. Don't waste your money on this garbage."
1,Oh dear--abuse is minimized in this book,"The author does exactly what the subsequent reviews claim: abuse is minimized into a relationship ""disagreement,"" with the DISASTROUS advice (born of fundamentalist ideology, not meaningful understanding of abuse dynamics) that the victim's role is to soothe the abuser, thus converting the abuser through the process of granting him MORE power and control. This is the kind of logic that would throw more drugs to a drug addict and wondering why he's not getting any better: ""But I gave in and gave him everything he wants!"" I hope women who need a book on this subject will contact a local women's center or by visiting a national helpsite like www.ncadv.org"
1,I'm sending it back,"I did not find this book helpful at all. It started in the preface, where she urges the reader to turn to a loving Father God for healing.... In my experience, the words loving & father just don't go together -- I realize that she used the mainstream way of referring to God, but it was still kick in the gut. Later in the book, she has examples of people who were rejected & verbally abused by one parent or the other, and they turned out to be gay. The implication is that people become gay because of the rejection or acceptance of a parent -- a theory so ridiculously out of date and preposterous I can't believe it could be stated with a straight face. Her other examples were also either hard to relate to or just unhelpful.I can see where this book was well-intentioned, and maybe I was biased because of the God language, but it didn't help me any."
2,Music great-Recording awful,"The musical arrangements on the disc are great, but the recording is terrible. I really don't believe I have heard a CD this bad."
1,I wish I was dreaming,"I enjoy chick-lit a lot but this is no chick-lit. The writing felt forced with the chick voice that was trying to come through but didnt. What is expected in a chick-lit book is a single girl in the city. Moving back to a small town to help her family is nice, but is not chick-lit style. I dont plan on seeing what happens next, Id rather read real chick-lit."
5,A new shining star in Christian Chick Lit!,"After years being a member and an officer in American Christian Fiction Writers, I have had the opportunity to read many fine published and unpublished novels by today's greatest Christian authors. When I had the opportunity to review *Dreaming in Black & White*, I was hooked from the first page. Not only did I immediately connect with the author's quirky sense of humor, but I was drawn in by the strong characterization and story. Laura has breathed real life into her characters and the situations in her novel, and I cannot wait to read more from this wonderful new author!"
4,Pretty good value for the price compared to other products,I have started using this eye cream after the pricing and formula of the NV Perricone eye product changed. I think this works just as well for about half the price.
5,No David- YES to a great book,No David is a great book for kids. My daughter always laughs when we read the book- and that is almost daily. I used to also read it in school and even my primary kids thought it's funny.I can highly recommend other children's books by David Shannon.
4,"No, David, No Fun; Know, David, Know Fun","No, David by David Shannon is a hilarious book. The story tells of a little boy, David, who causes his parents trouble by constantly doing what he shouldn't do. My favorite part of this book is by far the illustrations. The facial expressions Shannon gives to David's character are classic! David's expressions clearly convey what he's feeling, whether it is anger at having been reprimanded, or joy at having so much fun being bad. Through the use of color, Shannon makes it clear to the reader exactly what David is feeling. He uses bright reds and oranges when David is angry or enraged, and calming colors such as blues and purples and grays when David is gloomy or sad. We, the readers, never lack understanding of David's emotions. The ending is my second favorite part. It teaches a lesson we all need to be reminded of from time to time: no matter what we do, our parents will always love us."
4,Trouble has a new name.,"David Shannon, No, David! (Blue Sky Press, 1998)The David books are something special indeed, and for the life of me I can't figure out why. I mean, come on, those illustraions are downright terrifying! But my son loves them (it could of course be because his name is David), and so do I. They're funny as anything, and Shannon's text is both simple enough to be easily understood by the pre-lit set and is integrated strongly with the illustrations--there's enough for a basic description, but in order to fully get it, the child has to grasp (or the parent has to explain, which I think would defeat the purpose) the cause-and-effect relationship between the text and the picture. The series is, and will remain, a mainstay at our house. ***"
1,Nothing enjoyable in this story!,"Just another in a long line of books that purport to be ""modern"" when, in fact, what they are is offensive. Any real child who behaved as David does would be spending a lot of time in his room! For an even more miserable read, try ""David Goes to School,"" the perfect illustration of every teacher's worst nightmare. You won't find these books on the shelf in MY classroom..."
2,"uh oh, No Lahli","I am not sure which book of this series was read in my 3 year old's preschool class, but after reading these books we had to take a trip to the ER. I did not know my daughter was reading these books in school and she said she stuck something up her nose like David... well, after sitting and waiting at the ER for 2 hours we found out that she had stuck a screw up her noise. Teachers, please make sure your students know that these are things you really should not do. Otherwise you may have a very worried parent in the Emergency Room who is not accepting of the book choices you are making... make sure it is age appropriate, please."
1,"Great book for teaching ""bad"" behavior!","We bought this book just after my son's third birthday. The book quickly made it into the ""top ten"" for bedtime reading. However, he also quickly started copying most of the ""David"" behaviors in the book. Long after the book was ""lost"", he would still scream ""I want to run down the street naked!"", and to this day (over a year later), he still jams his finger up his nose to the second joint. Hey, I've got an idea -- how about a humorous book about all the things you can do with matches, or maybe knives?"
1,No! NO! NO!,"Too negative and I still don't like it!!This book is overly simple and dreadful. If you feel like you haven't said ""no"" enough times in a day then this book is for you. Uninspiring. Save your money I'll tell you how the no book ends, ""I still love you."" Scary pictures and pointless."
1,"Please, ""No David!""","I am ordering this book to show staff and adult students, at my pre-schools, an inappropriate book for toddlers and pre-schoolers. If a child did not exhibit these behaviors before, they got plenty of good ideas! The title, content and back cover is negative reinforcement. The mother seems powerless and the child, terrified to be out of control. No effort, other than sleep, was made to illustrate remediation. The image of a child running naked down a road is particularly worrisome. This book was brought to my attention by a family whose child continues to exhibit all of David's behaviors."
1,Completely WRONG for children,This book is simply WRONG to read to a child. There is zero positive reinforcement. Page after page of David acting like a nightmare and at the end of the book all she says is I love you. Disturbing this book has won an award.
3,"No, David!","I like this book becuse it is hilarious. I like it whenDavid gets in trouble. I like when David said, ""Do you love me?""His mom said, ""I love you very much David. Don't let anyone tellyou I don't love you because if they do, you call me, but makesure I'm home. Then call me at work if I'm not."""
1,NOTHING BUT A BARE BOTTOM,"I have read this book aloud several times to kids at home and at school and find that the only thing of real interest there to the kids to whom I have read it is a bare-bottomed David running down the street.Time to return to more classic children literature like Blueberries for Sal, The Biggest Bear or Where the Wild Things Are. Better stories, illustrations and staying power."
5,"No, David",My 3 old grandaughter loves this book. She knows this book by heart. I would love to see more..
3,Concerns about modeling negative behaviors,"My 3 1/2 year old son is ADHD and extremely impressionable. He frequently copies inappropriate behaviors. I thought he might identify with David in a positive way, (David certainly seems to fit the profile!) and I liked the final message of unconditional love. Unfortunately, my son keeps referring to David's antics and tells me how he wants to do things David does (like draw on the walls). He gets such a thrill out of seeing David's behaviors that we had to nix the book. So if you're the parent of an ADHD child considering the book for the same reason I did, I would not recommend it."
1,How did this win an award?,"I got this book for my 3 year old because they read it at preschool. I'll sometimes pick up books that they've read at preschool so that we can also read them at home. It's obviously just my very minority opinion, but this book is terrible. The pictures are quite harsh, and it's just page after page of poor David doing things and getting yelled at. My son was actually somewhat worried about the fish on the cover. 'Mommy, those fish look really worried... will they be okay?' Sorry, but there are way too many excellent children's books out there to add this to your collection."
2,In The Minority,"I realized before I purchased this book it was for an older age group. My son is 2 1/2. However, after reading the reviews from others who have 2 year olds and raved about the book, I felt comfortable in ordering it. I, like all parents of toddlers, understand the trouble they get into and thought this book would be fun. When I first looked at it, I was a taken back by the pictures and thought David looked, quite frankly, demonic. I showed my son with a smile on my face and enthusiasm, but, he too also just stared at the pages with a blank stare not sure how to react. At the end of the book he told me ""scary"" and to put it away. That's exactly what I've done and will find an older child who will enjoy this book. As for our family, No David, gets a big thumbs down."
5,his favorite book,"No, David is billed as a book for ages 3-5. My boy is 22 months and from the first page No, David became his new favorite (bumping 'The Three Bears' from a long-held position). He now begins with 'no no no no' as soon as we enter his room for books at the end of the day. He got the joke right away and loves David's mischievous-but-innocent antics.Sweet and sentimental stories are great for small kids, but the occasional romp and riot is fun too. I find myself saying 'No, Aaron' all too often and it must seem a constant refrain to him. Having some fun with it has been great relief to us both.No, David is a real masterpiece."
4,"I, too, have a David!","I found the book No David while browsing our local bookstore. I read and cried at the same time. I, too, have a David. He captured my three year old perfectly. My David loves to wear his red boots with a cape (usually a towel) tied to his neck. He loves to hit the ball in the house and run outside with no clothes on his body. We now have a big lock on our door so he cannot get outside.I have tried many ways to tell him to stop doing something but ""No, David"" seems to be the one that comes out of my mouth the most.I, too, have a David and love him with all my heart."
1,Would not recommend for sensitive younger children,"Just say NO! to buying this book as a gift! We just received this book as a birthday present. My son who is almost 4 was totally upset from it. It is a horrible choice for young children who are sensitive. There are much more positive creative books to purchase such as those by Oliver Jeffers. I would not recommend it as a gift choice and would screen as an option for young children, as parents and child alike do not expect some of the negative illustrations. We were disappointed by all the hype."
5,21 month old loves book,"I'm glad to see so many positive comments regarding this book. Some parents have expressed concern with this book teaching bad habits to their kids. But this book provides the opportunity for parents to teach what is appropriate and inappropriate behavior for their kids. This book is a great way for parents to explain what David is doing wrong (sneaking into the cookies), his emotions (happy, sad, mad), what type of foods and toys he has (language development), and what happens to David when he gets in trouble (time-out). My 21 month old enjoys reading this book over and over again and we discuss the different ""David"" scenarios. Instead of sheltering our kids from bad behavior, we need to take these examples and use them as learning opportunities. Our kids will learn bad behavior from people and situations all around them and it is our job as parents to show our kids how we deal with inappropriate behavior."
5,David is Great!,"The No, David! books are my 2 year old daughter's favorite books. We have to read No, David! and David Goes to School at least 6 times a day. She has No, David! memorized and will ""read"" along with us. I don't understand the negative reviews from some parents who claim that their children are picking up bad habits from these books. It's a pretty simple concept, books are pretend, in real life, you don't do that. Even a 2 year old understands that. My older two kids like the books as well. This was the first book that my 6 year old read on her own, to her sisters. The words are simple for early readers, and the pictures are amusing to most kids (except perhaps for the super sensitive, highly suggestible children who can't understand the concept of pretend and real)."
1,Negative and scary pictures for little kids - not for preschool and under,"I dislike this book; it is negative and I think the pictures are a bit scary for little kids (David has sharp pointy teeth). The book shows David doing naughty things (things my preschooler wouldn't even think of doing until this book put ideas in her head), then the adult goes to the child and yells ""NO DAVID!!"" Which to me is sending the wrong message; THEN when David gets put into the corner he is crying and upset there isn't anything for resolution of the emotional and behavior issue. There isn't enough information for a child to understand anything other than ""NO DAVID!!!"" and that the child does naughty things. I don't believe in throwing books away, but this one was almost hard just to give away. There is no lesson of love, mistakes made and forgiveness - just yelling at your kid and them either acting out more or crying."
3,"really excessive on the ""no's""!","I thought this book would be great for my 18 mo old based on other reviews & the fact that i am now starting to have to say ""no"" to many things. The book is VERY excessive in saying no to poor David...the last page where the mother hugs him almost comes across as an ironic joke...after soooo much nagging of your child, the ""i love you"" doesn't strike me as sincere as i had hoped. not a very uplifting read."
2,Huh?,"Yes, there are (many) times to tell your child ""no!"" but you also need to explain WHY you are saying it. This book just shows David being a kid, doing things he obviously finds fun, but being told ""no"".....then having a time-out and then being told he's loved. Weird book....."
4,It's funny.,I think the best part is where he goes running down the street naked. I like this book because it's funny. And because it's not boring.
1,Save up for something a little better,"I know it's tempting and to be honest it hasn't broken or anything but . . .Power output is so poor, I can crank to full volume and it really isn't overly loud = no headroom = overburdening the amp = sucky sound quality overall.Controlls are not well laid out. Adjustments for balance of rears to main for dolby is weird. I always have to get my manual out to figure out how to get to it. Some changes must be made with the remote you can't use the front panel controlls.Remote is a piece of junk.All in all, save another $100 bucks and get something else"
1,Died after two years,"The power supply died after less than two years of mild use. Now I have to trash it? The sound was so-so, with a high pitch all the time. Good for begginers."
1,Wimpy,I'm not a head-banger or a play-it-loud freak by any means. But I was amazed at how little volume came out of this thing. I guess you get what you pay for. Thank goodness for Amazon's easy return policy!
5,Fabulous Value!,"This receiver is a fabulous value. I've had several of them since they were released, and they work great. The remote is junk however. Buy a pre-programmed replacement later, and you'll be fine.I must comment on one other thing... After reading several comments about low volume, or lousy sound, I have to respond... Those folks must have crummy, inefficient speakers. I've used the AV-D58 with various brands of speakers in my recording studio. It has beautiful sound and plenty of volume! My personal listening system uses Infinity Studio Monitor speakers. I've been listening to Super Audio CD's on my Sony Blu-Ray player (through the optical link) and it sounds fabulous!Snap one of these puppies up over the Interweb, sit back and enjoy!"
5,Absolutely an Amazing Album from an Amazing Artist,"This is one of the most incredible albums I have ever heard...Christian or secular. There is a sincerity and uniqueness present in this recording that make it so special. Not very many albums have that. This CD is in constant rotation in my library and I will listen to it for a long time to come. This is by far the best worship CD I have acquired in years. That's coming from someone who buys every worship CD I can get my hands on.And just wait...his new CD drops April 25, 2006. Info is available on it at his myspace page at www.myspace.com/philwickham"
2,"Same Stuff, Different Cover","I own all of the Gygaxian books thus far. Seriously, each of these books are the same, and many copy the exact same information, simply copy/pasted or paraphrased over and over again. I loved World Builder, but seriously too many of these books are the same now.If you read World Builder, Living Fantasy and now Nation Builder, you will find they are almost identical and just borrow from each over.I would NOT recommend this junk. It sold itself out to the publisher along time ago."
4,It Works,I used this nailer to finish my basement including the oak trim around the windows and doors. It never jammed. The penetration of the brads was adjustable and predictable. It's now a valuable tool in my workshop.
2,Not for big hands,"I have big hands, and the trigger pinches my middle finger. The only way to avoid this is to purposefully hold the nailer in an awkward position. I returned it. Never used it. Maybe they should come is sizes..."
5,Milwaukee Quality = Happy Customer (2 years),"This Milwaukee brad nailer is by far the best nailer I own. I have use some Craftsman, Hitachi, Bosch, and others, but this nailer is so smooth and lightweight it is an absolute pleasure to use. It is also oil-less so this is just one less hassle and no emissions of any oily residue on your finish work. Mine also comes with a nice case to protect the nailer and hold accessories. The spring loaded nail magazine is a nice touch that does make it easy and convenient to reload. This is a nice versatile brad nailer that I would recommend to anyone.** UPDATE **I have owned this nailer for two years now and still love it. No problems so far!"
4,Good Nailer,"Great gun, thousands of brads shot through it. Works best on work with a relatively flat surface for the nosepiece to rest on. I wish they would make the nosepiece pointed like my bostitch. I actually had to pull my nose pad off and file my down a bit because it wouldn't set brads deep enough in some materials, and I had plenty of air pressure behind it. After putting the pad back on works great. The hook was a great idea freeing up an extra hand is always great. I am impressed with both of my milwaukee guns and going to try more."
3,pretty good,"this book was a pretty good book, but it was not as good as the other misty books. but it was still pretty good."
5,Grandchildren will love it,"We have a camping trip planned this May for Assateague Island, so L purchased the Misty books for my Grandchildren to read before the trip. Thought that they would enjoy some of the history of the area,"
5,Misty's Twilight,"Misty's Twilight was written by Marguerite Henry but is illustrated by Karen Haus Grandpre. I think this book is a good book for kids who like ponies. I think kids from age 8 to 12 would like this book. This book was voted number one by kids for the State Childen's Choice Award Winner. This book is about a pony named Misty Twilight and she is part thoroughbred and also part Chincoteague. She is one hundred percent fire and talent. Misty is the most famous pony ever. Misty is a pony bred from Chincoteague's Twilight and has greatness in her blood. Misty has a chance to shine and become a cutting horse, a jumping horse or one that participates in the graceful art of dressage. Misty Twilight is a ancestors were wild ponies living on a untamed island. You will want to know if Misty Twilight can compete against the best horse in the world and wonder can she win?"
3,Average,"From Here to Maternity (clever name!) was your typical chick lit book. Lots of angst, mixed in with comedy and light writing style.I did enjoy reading the book. It was a very easy read. I was a little disappointed by the ending (no, I won't give it away...)This book was an average chick lit book."
3,A cute book if you are without a book,"This is a cute book. Not earthy shattering fiction, but cute and endearing in it's own way. Ad an American I had some trouble with the language and spellings used in the book (It takes place is AUS.). However, I soon got used to it and the reading became better and faster. Not the top of my list of books, but something to try."
5,fine resource,"This is another fine reference from the Facts on File Writer's Library, and is a terrific resource for writers, readers, students and teachers.Phrases are listed alphabetically, and each entry includes the pronunciation, etymology, grammatical information, definition, examples, abbreviations, derivatives, and cross-references. The book concludes with an index that organizes entries by language.The print is clean and I was able to find most of the phrases in which I was interested, but with only 4000 entries there are gaps; you will find actuall foreign phrases such as pas de deux, but you will also find Americanized foreign words like parole, so it isn't always clear what you will find here and what you won't, but words and phrases that are here are given a nice treatment. Useful if not exhaustive."
5,A great resource,"As a writer, I'm often forced to turn to foreign words or phrases to express my ideas. The Facts on File Dictionary of Foreign Words and Phrases has been indespensible in my search for just the right word or phrase. The clear and concise definitions are easy to follow and each entry is followed by the country of origin which I find particularly helpful.Non-writers will enjoy this book as well. Filled with interesting information, Manser has given the world a great resource and a new means for expanding our vocabularies."
2,Pretty pictures... BUT,"there are better books out there for ideas. This book just didn't appeal to me. I suggest you try ""A Wedding For All Seasons"" by Bette Matthews. Or Southern Living Weddings magazine."
5,WOW!,"My wife bought this to improve her handwriting. Her handwriting was almost completely illegible before she started, she sometimes could not read what she had written a few days back. She has made VAST improvements when she tries to write nice. Also writing nice for her is speeding up. I'm so impressed with her results that I asked for a copy for xmas!"
5,Very satisfied customer,"The book that I ordered arrived before its due date.It's condition was described as good.I would have described it as very good.I would have no hesitation in recommending this seller to anyone!The Italic Way to Beautiful Handwriting, Cursive and Calligraphic"
2,"This film is no ""afternoon delight.""","""An Intimate Friendship"" is a ""G"" rated film suitable for heterosexuals. The main thrust of this film is the ""coming out"" of a young woman to her best friend and sister. Lots of tangled relationships with over dialog and bad transitions. A low budget Lesbian film. I had to wait 58 minutes for the first Lesbian encounter. Not like I expected a porno flick...but please....arouse me! The film has a good twist if you're willing to wait for the end of the movie. Not a great movie if you're looking for a lot of Lesbian bedroom scenes. This one isn't it. You want hot steamy sex....buy ""Bound"" or ""Therese and Isabelle."" Both are available on DVD on this website."
5,love this book,"I bought this book for my prek 3 class when we do a lesson on friends. I just love the story, easy for them to understand, cute pictures. I can't wait to read it to them."
4,You won't find a better or more accurate book!,"My friend and I used this book (previous edition) to cycle/camp from San Fransisco to Los Angeles. Although the milage/elevation was slightly off the book was indespensable. We meet a guy from Amsterdam who was riding from Seattle to Los Angeles (without a helmet?!?) who was very excited when he saw our book had campsites his maps didn't. 508 miles in 7 days without a hitch, a big thanks to the authors. I also used the book on a ride around the San Juan islands (north of Seattle) it was amazing, I believe these rides are not in the current edition hence the 4 out of 5 stars."
3,Just OK,"This book should really be titled, ""Touring the Pacific Coast By Bicycle"" because it really isn't about the cycling. Following the route in this book pretty much takes you on the most direct route down the coast and misses some great riding roads. Might be OK if you are pulling a trailer or carrying too much stuff but if you are travelling light and like riding, I'd suggest the Adventure Cycling and Krebs Maps as better routes. It does suggest some nice parks to stay at but I found it not worth the weight and ended up leaving it at a friends halfway through my trip."
4,A guide to Pacific Coast cycle touring,"BICYCLING THE PACIFIC COAST: Very good book. Comprehensive and information in excess of what I had expected. As I plan a long trip, though, going through potential routes in segments can be very time consuming though I am certain that was not the primary intent of the book. The detailed information, alternate routes, things to see and do along the way are very well done."
2,"Book is fine, but with real limitations","I had a previous (1990, 2nd ed.) version of this book, and just bought the latest 2005 edition. I'd hoped for more updating, but the book hasn't changed much, and retains all the same limitations. The book is an okay reference, but there are better, more helpful ones out there. Planning my trip from Crescent City to San Francisco, I'm relying more on my Krebs CA North Coast Bicycle Touring maps, Google maps and [...], and a copy of Tom Stienstra's California Camping (to find where to stay).In ""Bicycling the Pacific Coast"", the route/ mileage logs are detailed, yet don't give much of a visual picture. The maps aren't much help--they have little detail, so correspond only very broadly with the mileage logs. The authors suggest AAA or other maps to supplement, but why not include the necessary information here? The highlighted path also tends to stick too often to major highways like 101 or 1, when a side or other rural road might be a better choice."
4,Excellent Product!,"Nioxin System 3 Cleanser works just as advertised -- hair feels squeaky clean, without making it dry or frizzy, and really does help protect color ! Also gives fine, thin hair a needed boost.....will use this product from now on !"
5,Great bargain & seems to work!!!,"Compared to Supercut's where they sell it for double the price, this is a bargain!!! Seems to really help thicken hair, and we'll still have to see about any hair regrowth! :)"
3,"Nioxin Cleanser, System 3",I liked the shampoo but the conditioner is too powerful for my fine hair that is already somewhat greasy. The scalp treatment again is okay but is cumbersome to use after using the shampoo.
1,Knock off,"I don't believe this is the real product. My hair is beginning to fall out after use. It is not the same product, the real cleanser 3 is pearly, this is clear. Also, the label on the front is pasted on. Manufacturer on the back says Wella Corporation and made in Mexico. That is not on my 'real' bottle. Not happy with this purchase."
1,Nioxin products are great. Beware when buying online!,"I have been using products from Nioxin's for over 10 years though always purchased from reputable beauty salons. Nixion delivers a quality product line that works. The reason for this review is to alert the buyer to use caution before purchasing this hair product from online (unknown) vendors.Due to my busy schedule this past month, I purchased Nioxin, Cleaner, 3, from one of Amazon's distributors. After receiving it, I questioned the authenticity of it. The bottle labeling seemed a little strange and the quality and smell was off.Today, I purchased another bottle from the local beauty salon. And, was instantly validated that the online product was in deed an imitation."
1,"The problem is Proctor and Gamble, not the vendors","The problem is Proctor and Gamble, not the vendors. Proctor and Gamble moved the production to Mexico after buying Nioxin Research Laboratories and closing Georgia plant.They changed the ingredients lists of the products, removing important plant extracts. I used Nioxin for many years but now it's completely different product.They are ruining the great brand."
1,Your photo shows gold cap and you send black cap---Ripped off-- knock off from Mexico,"I specifically searched the Amazon website looking for the gold cap Nioxin shampoo. If your vendor sells black cap made in Mexico product, that is what should be pictured. There is a big difference in these products- - gold cap made in USA smells better, and works better. Really feel ripped off over this!!!"
1,Package came in spilled,"I've bought this product from Amazon before but perhaps from a different vendor. Anyway, when I opened the box, some portion have already been spilled insid the box as there was no seal on the cap which was not the case w/ my previous purchase of this product. Then it makes me wonder if this product was legit or not."
3,"good transaction, not sure about the effect of the product","I ve been using this for more than a month. Not bad but i don't feel like my hair got better than before.I need to try it more than two months.But, worth to try it, I guess."
3,Good shampoo,"Cleans well, leaves hair feeling and smelling great. Don't know if it helps grow more, but sure doesn't hurt!"
5,Best in the World.,I have used this product for many years and love it. It has kept most of my hair from falling out. Wish I had found it sooner.
5,Mother's Hair Grew Back,"One of Mother's greatest joys included using Nioxon after chemo and her hair was growing back to the point where she didn't need to use a wig. She always had short, permed hair and it was growing back to her usual look. It was one of her great moments of freedom to not use the wig during a trying time for her. I would reccomend that everyone who desires that freedom and wants to give their own hair the best chance, try this for at least 3-4 mo. We saw spectacular results in much less time than that. I'd think you'd want chemically treated if you've had chemo as this says is has additional moisturizers for your scalp, and that would be important. Don't forget the ""conditioner"" called Scalp Therepy and the Nioxin special scalp spray on stuff for thinning hair. The three together worked tremendously for her."
2,not the Nioxin I remember,I will not be ordering this product again from this vendor GKC Enterprises - It says Nioxin 3 but it is not put out by Nioxin Laboratories - It is put out by Wella and the product doesn not have the same color or container I have before? I am not sure it is Nioxin
2,its ok - but,"this book is good as a""quick read tool"" but potential buyers would be much better off buying the ""real thing""--frontpage 2000 for dummies---the info is better detailed and explained.."
4,Good but could have been perfect!,"The chocolate are absolutely delicious however when they arrived, they were somewhat melted. It should have been packed in some sort of temperature cooling packaging and sent overnight."
2,"Hear Ye, Hear Ye, There Is A Great Jazz Singer Amomg Us","I currently own five cds by Dena. Some are better than others.For this cd Dena broke my heart with her lackluster reperitore.I only found four songs that I could enjoy and smile about. Whata waste of her vast talent to not offer a better selection of material.Also, on even the four tunes that I liked she seemed to tarnishthe tunes by humming along while her band was playing solo. I own the software to edit music, so I took out the unpleasentparts of the song that I hated.In all honesty, I can not recommend this cd to anyone!"
5,Great album! Get it!,"If you should buy only one album from the late 70's punk era this is it. Smart, energetic, heavy. ""Enough Time"" is one of my all time favorite tunes."
4,for every Potter fan,"We purchased this plush as a gift for our 12 year old Potter fan and she absolutely loves it. Even her 5 year old brother loves it, especially when he pulls the tongue. It was a big hit with her friends too. In fact, we bought a second one to give as a birthday gift. It is soft and light, making it an easy travel toy. It is a nice edition to any Potter fan's collection. The one caveat ... there seems to be no way to replace the battery. A major flaw in this otherwise whimsical and charming toy."
3,Fun toy for Harry Potter fans,"I ordered the ""Monster Book of Monsters"" for my son's Harry Potter party (along with some other HP stuff). It was really a hit with the kids--they were surprised when I pulled the tongue and it started to vibrate. It looks cute on a bed and would be great to use as a prop for any Harry Potter display."
1,I didn't pay that much! ($57.99!),"I bought this for my wife, who is a big fan of the Harry Potter movies and books. (As are the 4 kids) It is very light weight. You cannot 'open' it, and it has a little rumble pull string motor in it. It's cute. But I thought I had overpaid for this item at around $29.00! I bought it last year or the year before, and am sure I did not pay that much for it! (as of this writing it is listed here on Amazon for $57.99 ) Look elsewhere for a better price. Come back here too. I have seen prices drop on item's more then once here. And if you already paid the high price, bummer for you, they will not refund the difference. That policy changed a few years ago..."
3,Fun at First...,"Growls/rattles when you pull the books 'tongue'. Not an ""actual"" book with pages - it is a plush toy. Funny at first... entertainment value plummets after that. My nine year old die-hard Potter fan thought it was great (at first) but in all honesty, she threw it the closet and it has been there ever since!"
3,monster book,"This product seemed great at first but after a few times of pulling the tongue to hear the growl and see the shaking, i could see that it was not going to last long. The shaking never was very good. And the tongue pulled loose soon after i got it. I'm not really thrilled with the workmanship of this product."
3,cheaper at,disney world had them for cheap try looking around before u buy it here pretty high price here or check other places
3,Collector book,My daughter is a huge Harry Potter fan. I bought the book thinking it would spin around and snap it's pages like in the Harry Potter movie. It did none of that but when you pulled it's tongue the book shakes. My daughter didn't care she is a true Harry Potter fan and was just happy to display the book with her other collectables. The book itself is well made and is hard to fine for sale other places.
3,Fuzzy book,Very cute and soft. Bought it as a gift and the receiver thoroughly enjoyed it. Any Harry Potter fan would appreciate it. Shakes when the tongue is pulled which just adds to the cuteness.
3,Turbie Twists need an upgrade,"I bought these years ago because I have 4 daughters. Including myself, that equals a lot of towels every day. Although I liked the color variety and the whole Turbie Twist idea, the quality of the pack I just purchased was much lower than the one I received years ago. The shape of the towel itself is too large and the most disappointing fact of all is that they are no where near as absorbent as the old ones I have. What a disappointment. I bought a large pack as I did years ago because we are a soccer family and take lots of showers. The Turbie Twist makes my life easier because it offers less bulk and less laundry, but the quality has definitely gone downhill."
1,Nifty item-but not absorbent at all,"I have fine hair that dries fast, but these turbans do not dry it at all. When I take my hair down, it is as wet as when I put it up."
1,"Can't use it, won't resell it","I though this was the case with the molded sides, but this has soft sides. Saxophones are too delicate to put in a case with flexible sides. I didn't realize it until too late to return and don't want to sell it and contribute to the detriment of someone else's horn. Very disappointed with description of this case. Stuck with two underwhelming soft cases and keeping MY horn it its original box."
4,Great Dictionary,"This is a great dictionary. It's been helped me to improve my skills in English. It's not a dicionary for use when you are reading. It's more helpfull when you are writting.I have just one compliement: the quality of the paper. I bought the Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English as well. The quality, and the color of the second one is far better."
2,Cradle 2 the Grave,Pretty bad movie. I only bought it because I lost the library's copy. I couldn't suspend my disbelief enough to actually enjoy it.
2,yawn............................................,"dmx knows his tired rap act is through,so now hes trying to spread his tired image into movies.is it any wonder his movies(AND EVERY MOVIE OF THIS KIND)barely make it to see a second weekend?the saving grace here is jet li(a minimal save).jet li is also in a massive decline and proved that action also needs acting/believable plot.every rapper acts the same way,they are interchangable/easily forgotten.since i rented this,im not so upset.can you imagine how the crowd was during and after movie?rowdy and uncontrollable as if they were on prison leave.to some extent,you can tell the charactor of a person by what entertains them.im pretty sure the males in the audience couldnt wait to be dmx tough and start some nonsense.we all know how tough guys are....tough from a distance and only with alot of backup.typical and pitifull.any monkey can direct movies this horrible,but how can people actually rush to see this?so very sad..............................."
2,"Too much rap, not enough Jet Li","Get this: Jet Li and Mark Dacoscos are BOTH in this movie; and their fight scene is not spectacular?? It was tepid at best.. What happened??? DMX happened.This movie had way, way too much rap ...: the DMX character was just plain dumb, his street-talking cronies were annoying and the whole subplot with the daughter was ridiculous. To make matters worse, the director was constantly taking the camera away from Jet Li's amazing fight choreography to focus on DMX's stupid stunts and ""acting"" (Well, at least he did'nt start rapping in the middle of the movie). Imagine ""Romeo Must Die"" without all the good fight scenes, yuck.Yeah, stuff blows up real good, there are some good looking hoochies in the film, but I expect much, MUCH more from a movie with both Jet Li AND Mark Dacoscos.Jet Li fans: Buy ""Kiss of the Dragon"" or ""The One"" instead.DMX fans: Yo, just keep watching MTV, dog."
2,absolutely terrible,This movie is a complete waste of Jet Li's talent as a martial artist. Fights are not bad by american standarts(which is not saying much). DMX is playing a lead role which is a joke since he has no talent(playing a hoodlum in a movie is not a big stretch since he is one in real life) and Jet Li is redelegated to the role of his sidekick. Very dissapointing.
2,Wow Jet Li what heppen to you?,I understand that Li had a few bad movies but he always makes up for them. This one was pretty bad. After I finished watching this movie I decided that DMX is a bad actor/rapper. DMX needs to take a time out! Bottom line... You have seen this movie before in 1000 different scenes.
1,ONE OF THE WORST MOVIES I'VE SEEN ALL YEAR!,"I loathed this movie. I am beginning to hate all action movies in general. They used to be well-written and intelligent- (ex. Terminator 2: Judgement Day, The Fugitive)-now they are just dumbed down and stupid. DMX can't act, and Jet Li needs to find better material. Whoever wrote this script had a limited vocabulary...it's so painfully obvious. Unnecessary profanity plagued the dialogue (MO-FO this, and MO-FO that. F you, motherf-er, and other wonderful phrases, in an attempt to be gritty and ""realistic""). The film as a whole does not justify all of this. The happy ending is also contrived and pitiful. Total waste of time, and I wish I could get my money back.SKIP IT."
1,Cradle to the grave,Daredevil had horrible action scenes it had a terrible storyline thats why i would give it 1 star.
1,Dump Movie,"If you are just into some action, try it on your own risk.Otherwise watch a movie with a sparkle of sense.The plot is very basic, hilarious and seen a hundredtimes.Dialogs are miserable. Listening to Ernie and Bertis much more interesting.Half star for the cool voice of DMX and another half onefor Jet Lee."
2,CRADLE 2 THE GRAVE,"Apart from the Kill Bill volume 1&2 and The Matrix 1&2 Hollywood make rubbish martial arts films.This is no different than Exit Wounds or the equally dire Romeo Must Die. The fundamental problem is making hiphop themed martial arts films is a big mistake! In these films you have good old Anthony Anderson, Tom Arnold as crap comic relief, an oiled DMX and his stage school homeboys trying to act tough . Last but not least you have a bemused Jet Li on wires, thinking to himself ''silly westerners you have missed the point of martial arts''.Still you do get major league honeys in this type of film!"
1,way corny and Jet Li shouldnt of been in this,boring and horrible heist/kidnapping/trying to recuse the kidnappe movie with DMX's daughter being kidnapped and Jet Li a cop who helps him. the plots dumb and the action is mindnumbly painful. DMX has to much neck wear and Jet Li should of stayed out because his movies are getting crappy lately. for fans of the rapper who was much better in Romeo Must Die and who had a small part.
3,Good,"It's a good movie, alltough it's nothing new.I don't like the idea of the cop teaming up with the bad guy..It's allmost like ""Romeo must die"" with the daughter being kidnapped and the circle of fire at the end where Jet Li takes on his oppenent.But the action's good, Jet Li's proven he's a good fighter, especially at the illegal fightin scene, loved the way he kicked those fighters around.It's has some good humor in it to.."
2,"Enough Is Enough, Mr. Silver","I love Jet Li movies, but producer Joel Silver should think about retiring the cut-n-paste productions (compare all the similar elements between this flick, ""Romeo Must Die,"" and ""Exit Wounds""). The previous two weren't bad, but I fear that Hollywood in-breeding is becoming fatal for this group. This is just a patch work film with all the participants (and there are far too many) getting their ten minutes and not enough real plot (or acting ability) to keep the strands together. Li's fight scenes are somewhat tired here.For the record, the DVD is fine. There are some short but effective featurettes (one of which focuses on the use of multiple cameras for shooting action scenes, the ring of fire finale being the subject). It's a solid DVD for a mediocre flick. Two stars is generous."
4,Great Movie,"This movie had it all in my opinion. Sweet fast cars, hot chicks, intense action scenes, Eminem music, DMX flavour, Tanks, and even a little sentimental element so you can watch it with your girl and be like ""see, he loves his daughter""Overall I'd say its most definently worth a rental, and for the bigtime action fans, its a good purchase.DVD features are great, you get the DMX ""X Gonna Give It To You"" music video (though its edited for some reason, c'mon, its a rated R movie, why cant the music video be uncensored??) And then the trailer, some cast and crew information, and a few video segments on parts of the movie (how they filmed scene X and so on) I spent a good half hour messing around with the special features, and I thought they were enjoyable."
4,Great Stunts,At first I thought it was going to be some gang banging in the hood but I was so wrong thank goodness. Actually it's packed with action and great stunts from Jet Li and a few from DMX. It tells about the struggle of a father (DMX) who steals for a living. He steals a rare item and manages to get this cop (Jet Li) chasing after him to retreive the thing stolen. Eventually the item gets stolen by another group of people and DMX's character daughter gets kidnapped and held at ransom for the return of item. This throws the cop and the thief together in trying to rescue the little girl and get back the stolen item. Definately worth seeing for the Jet Li action.
4,about this movie......,The story base of this movie is good and the fighting skill wise is the usual fighting sequence that is often used by Jet Li in ost of his Kung Fu style movies. Warner Brother did give him(a chinese) a chance to prove his acting skill in Kung Fu unlike hero or Shanghai knights where the movies looks more towards the joke fighting category rather than a more serious form of Kung Fu fighting eg like Jet Li's movie or the true Master Art of Shaolin Temple(18 brave hero fighting sequence or called shi ba luo han).
2,Not at all What I expected,"Cradle to Grave was, for me , a let down. I expected to see more Jet Li action . He seemed held back, as if he could not fully express his abilities. It appears as though he did not want to ""show up"" the other actors.As much of a Jet Li fan as I am, I regret to say that this move disapointed me.BMX and Jet Li did not fit together well. I think that Jet Li's part could almost have been anybody else.The story also disapointed me. It did not seem right that a cop,(from Tiwan) and a thief got together to save the world. It didn't make sense."
3,"eh, it pretty good but nothing special",Jet Li is pretty good in this movie but he could've done better because all of the old chinese martial arts films he was amazing i recommend you go see it but nothing more than that.
2,Read this before you see it.,"I love Jet Li. I think he is amazing and can do fantastic things. But this was his worst. I hate to see Li in such a bad movie. DMX. Those are three letters I never want to see again in that order. He should stick to rapping because his acting is just plain sad. The fight scenes are the only good things in this movie, and don't get me wrong, they are quite cool but please don't waste your money like I did. If you want to see it that bad, just spend a few bucks renting it."
2,ok,The only reason this movie is in my library is because of my husband. I've seen it before with him and always fell asleep or found something else to do. Last night I gave this movie a second chance and I have to say.... it wasn't bad. I didn't watch it all the way threw but it is a good movie with good acting.
2,"Horrible acting, somewhat decent action","All the acting in this movie is bad. All of it. Don't watch this for the acting. Kelly Hu is really aweful. Jet li is well - Jet Li. Not too bad, not too good as far as his acting. DMX isn't too bad for a rapper, but definitely not good. The supporting cast is generally bad. Martial arts wise, there's some. A few good scenes. Kiss Of The Dragon was much better. You're better off watching Jet's back catalogue including FIST OF LEGEND; ONCE UPON A TIME IN CHINA, etc."
5,Classics from Q,"Quincy Jones has made a Long Lasting Impression on Me.not only as a Producer but also for His own Material.""the Sanford&Son theme"" is timeless for me.the way He arranges&brings the Horns&voices together in His work makes you always take notice.this is a Great set of His solo Material.I've followed His Career for many moons&The Man has always challenged Himself fully.a Great Musical Genius who always gets the fullness out of His Productions&Artists."
5,QUINCY IS AWESOME,"Just got this CD and I am not surprised to hear wonderful music here. No matter who or what Quincy works with, he works magic, and that's for sure. My personal favorites are CAST YOUR FATE, JUST ONCE, STREET BEATER, and KILLER JOE. Get this, ""good"" music lovers; you won't regret it!"
2,"Good Company, Bad Mouse","I really liked this mouse when I first got it--it was responsive, comfortable to use, and easy to install. It went through batteries pretty quickly, but this wasn't a big deal to me as I use rechargeables.After owning it for less than a year, the glue started seeping out from under one of the finger pads, leaving my hand sticky and the pad peeling up. I emailed Kensington and they quickly sent me a replacement and told me to destroy the damaged one. Fantastic customer service!Unfortunately, after less than six months with the replacement, the scroll wheel has stopped working. It still spins, but doesn't seem to ""grab"" to actually make the page move. I won't be asking for a replacement, as frankly I don't want another one of these."
5,Great mouse,This mouse is great. It fits right into the mold of your hand and moves with great precision.
2,Stopped working,I used this mouse for about a month and all of a sudden it stopped working. I tried it on 2 different computers to make sure it wasn't the USB port on my computer. I haven't decided if it is worth the bother to return it.
3,an alright mouse,"cons- the scroll wheel is pretty slow and ""clicky"", I prefer a fast, free-wheeling scroll- the on/off switch is at the bottom, which makes me always forget to turn it off- its really small, like smaller than I thought it would be and its sometimes uncomfortable for my hand (i'm a small lady)- the usb component fits into the bottom for travel, but in the process, it turns your mouse back on if it was already offpros:- its small, for easy carrying- battery life is really long- is useful on most surfaces- works with macs well"
1,Spend a little more and get something that works,"I took delivery of this mouse today, and I am sorry I wasted my time in purchasing it. It worked sporadically and then quit. I followed all of the trouble-shooting suggestions (replacing the batteries, switching the USB port, trying it on another computer). Yes, the on-off button was on (the mouse lit up as advertised, and worked for a few minutes, and that was it. Aside from the lights, this thing may was well be a lump of coal.I can see many other purchasers have had a good experience with their units - good on them. I guess I got the lemon this time."
5,"Nice, wireless mouse!","This mouse is on the small side, which is fine for me, but could be a problem is you have larger hands. It is very comfortable and works just fine. I have had this for a year now and the batteries haven't died on me yet (which is probably not normal). It does not have a very long wireless range, so if you want to use this for giving presentations or lectures or something where you have to move away from the computer, this is probably not the mouse for you. However, if you just want a simple, cordless mouse, this is a great product."
3,Not bad product,"It touches very comfortably and really easy to use.But its defects are also very obvious. Sometimes (although the frequency is low) it loses control, you need re-configuration through software or unpluging signal receiver to make it works well again. The most unsatisfactory facet is that battery is consumed too fast. Maybe 2 months at most, not one year as the company boasts."
5,Good in-expensive mouse.,"If you are looking for a good in-expensive mouse, you have found your answer with the Kensington Ci65m. This great little mouse works well with small and / or large hands. Batteries seem to last forever. Touch is nice. I have been very happy with my purchase."
2,"Great for Mac, Crashed my PC","Works perfect with my macbook, so I bought another one for my other laptop, an HP entertainment PC. Right when I plugged the receiver in, it crashed my HP. I had to do a system restore and I tried it again, SAME RESULT. It seems to be a great mouse if it doesn't crash you computer."
3,kensington mouse,"I have had this mouse about 3-4 weeks. It works good except that it freezes mostly when my computeris asleep and when you awaken it. the mouse doesn't respond. I have to manually shut down mycomputer and then restart and it is ok again. Very frustrating. Also sometime the roll bar doesn'twork. Certain web pages it will work and others won't. I have a MAC so i""m notsure what the issue is. Rather disappointed. I'll probably have to buy a different mouse."
5,Kensington wireless mouse,"THE FIRST ONE I BOUGHT WAS ABOUT SIX MONTHS AGO.STILL ON THE SAME BATTERIES.IT'S NICE AND HEAVY,NO DELAYS,GOOD RANGE.VIRTUALLY NONE OF THE ISSUES YOU READ ABOUT WITH OTHER WIRELESS UNITS."
3,Worked Great - Until it didn't anymore.,"I bought this mouse to go along with my first laptop. When I got it I was very excited about it. The mouse works great, it has a sleek storage space for the USB wireless connector and it even feels good in your hand. I had the thing for about a month before it broke. The mouse fell literally 12 inches and then the left click wouldn't work. I know it was 12 inches because it fell from the top of my bag to the floor. Not a very sturdy design."
3,Don't like it,"It's too small. It being heavy helps - but I feel like I'm trying to push a HopScotch rock over a Quigie(sp?) Board. Gotta find a differnt one to replace it. A couple pluses (if you're still reading this) - It's easy to change the batteries; The sides have dimples which help to grip it. Would not recommend it for anyone who has an average hand size or above though. Love ya's, Vic"
4,Great Songs by a Great Singer,"What more can be said about such a great natural voice? The songs are great, but the recording quality is not so sharp on this CD. Needless to say, the songs were not recorded in the studios of today. The lyrics, and voice of Pedro Infante, are a joy to hear and one is tempted to sing along, or just sit and enjoy. (In case the reader is unfamiliar with Pedro Infante, the reader should know all songs are sung in Spanish)"
4,"Neat style piece, minor design SNAFU","I have the turquoise version of this watch. Style is, of course, completely personal, and so I won't speak to that here. I have other Starck watches, and this is my favourite, but, beware of one design problem: the LED's are not visible in daylight. I find myself having to cover the top of the watch to see the time while out of doors. Not such a big deal, although given that this was obviously required, it's a bit silly that the 'illuminate' button is on the top-right of the watch, as this makes it impossible to press while covering the face with your right hand. For lefties, this is nearly ideal, so you might consider wearing it on your right arm generally.Having said this, I wear this watch all the time, and it's easy to read the LED's indoors. Having to push the button to see the time is actually a boon to my productivity - having to do this has made me less of a clock watcher."
4,Good but was deliver on Grey,"Is a Really good Watch, I was searching for years, but they deliver me the wrong color in Grey. But still like it a lot."
4,Boat alternator,Seemed to be a quality item. The instructions were very clear. Item was well packed and shipped promptly. 800 number for questions was nice touch.
5,Has Everything,"I had the good fortune of using this book for a seminar paper. Truly, all that can be said is this is the most comprehensive source on Roman comedy you will find anywhere. It is well written and easy to use. Some knowledge of latin is a plus, but not really required. I would recomend this book to anyone looking for serious scholarship on Roman comedy."
5,Britten's String Quartets are given exemplary performances,"The Belcea Quartet seems to have a particular affinity for the string quartets of Benjamin Britten. The performances here of these works (String Quartet No. 1 in D major, Op. 25, String Quartet No. 2 in C major, Op. 36, and String Quartet No. 3, Op. 94 and Divertimenti for string quartet) provide a 'travelogue' of the composer's career, allowing us to hear works from the early years, through the middle very productive years, to the last period of his composing.Each of the Quartets is performed with what feel like utter ease - a true feat when the complexity of these compositions is understood. But the Belcea Quartet finds all of the searing melodies that span the works while giving dance to all of the virtuosic elements. This is a fine performance of chamber music too infrequently programmed. And performances such as these by the Belcea Quartet should alter that situation! Highly recommended. Grady Harp, June 06"
4,The Promise Bible...,"I like the Promise Bible. I really like the fact that all the promises of God are highlighted in blue. This Bible is not written in the King James Version, however, I think if you are doing an indepth study of scriptures, this is a very good resource. The scriptures are plain and simple; very easy to understand. I recommend this Bible for the person who wants to have an indepth understand of scripture and the promises that God has made to his people."
5,Great book-2nd edition even better,"This book is a classic in the field as evidenced by the long waiting list for used copies at McQuerry Books until the second edition came out in 1998 (I just placed an order for one from the American Orchid Society as it wasn't listed here). I would gladly buy a copy of the first edition if available.The first edition is an invaluable tool for orchid growers interested in the cultural requirements and ecology of these beautiful plants. The second edition is even better. I rate the second edition over the books of Lance Birk, Catherine Cash and Guido Braem for both the casual pap grower as well as expert growers.The diatribe by the anonymous 'Reader from New York' is totally unwarranted (sounds as thought it was written by a minion of Guido Braem, whose disagreements with Crib are well known in orchid curcles)."
1,Eagle,"This is a poorly written text, which depicts author's complete unfamiliarity with the Paphiopedilums. An amateurish writing. Cribb, whose initial PhD thesis is in the cultivated potatos of South America, has made every effort to make this writing credible. His lack of first hand experience in this field comes very clearly through in this book. His ideads are often out-dated, and he is totally out of touch with today's realities. He is often totally dependent on information given to him by others, without proper examination of harberium material in details. His conservation ideas are in extreme, unreal, and often tunnel-visioned singlarly.Contrary to his social status, Cribb needs many years of experience before being able to warite ably on such a specialized topic.A good try for an eager novice!"
2,Early Jack Vance,"The following comments are for the short novel House of Iszm.To be frank this novel is not one of Jack Vance's better efforts. It was written in the 1950's, published by Ace and reads like a modest first draft in need of revisions.The author constructs a detailed framework to hang an uninteresting tale of inter-planet stratagems. What really exasperating are the possibilities inherent in the plot that are not developed.The saga is pure space opera; two planets vie to control a third to increase wealth and power. One of the planets is dominated in it's physical and religious aspect by an enormous tree; an idea ripe with possibilities that is discarded after a few tantalizing paragraphs. Fortunately for the reader Vance's extraordinary imagination shines through in spots preventing this book from being a total loss.Fans of Vance should read these early novels to appreciate the maturity in later books. Casual readers should look to later works; this story will disappoint."
4,Awesome but Pricey,"This is an awesome product, super thin, great for any kind of workout but very pricey hence only 4 stars"
3,Good Work,"The other review is over-enthusiastic. Hardly an example of unbiased scientific inquiry, the author basically sets out to prove something and does so without searching for contradictory evidence. As a result, we get a self-fulfilling prophecy.Very interesting, never-the-less.Reader's should be warned that this is *not* an introductory text, and that it is not an overview of the area of tunings.Additionally, it is interesting that the word 'timbre' is in the title, as there is not one iota of original perceptual research here...and timbre is a preceptual phenomenon."
2,No CD ROM,"Just ordered brand new book from Amazon at 90+ dollars. Contrary to book decsription no CD ROM with sound examples was included or attached. I will be returning it tomorrow. Has anyone received a CD with this book? Thanks""This new and greatly revised edition of William Sethares' classic book includes an attached CD-ROM that contains over three hours of sound examples that demonstrate the ideas in action, as well as computer programs that enable readers to conduct their own explorations. ""Rating applied to missing content or false/ incorrect product description."
4,Decent Lawnmower,"Isn't quite as powerful as a gas mower, but does get the job done. Might need more than one pass on some sections of the yard. I also can smell burning plastic - is that bad? I guess I will find out."
4,"Reliable, quiet mower","This is our second Lawn Hog. The first one lasted 7 years. They're not anything fancy, but they work well and quietly, which is more than I can say about the many noisy, smelly mowers in the neighborhood."
3,"OK, but not great","The cord is super annoying. I thought since I had such a small yard it wouldn't be bad...but it gets in the way often and can double the time it take to mow. It mows ok, but if the grass is even a little damp it clumps a lot and leaves deposits all over the yard. I'll be getting a old fashioned gas mower next time."
4,Good for small yard like mine,I have had it and no problem with it. but too early to say some hing in either case I'm happy.
2,Uneven Cutting/Bad at Corners,"I have been unimpressed by this mower. I had read a review in Consumer Reports and they had found that it cut unevenly and that has been my experience as well. I am going to order a new blade and see if it works any better but I am not holding my breath. Also, the mower is not good at cutting area in corners so make sure you purchase a trimmer or hand shears as well. All in all- a not very impressive electric mower."
2,Black & Decker MM575 Electric Mower,"I received my electric lawn mower within several days of purchase; the mower was new and the box never opened, and I am thrilled with it. The mower is light, easily maneuvered, quiet compared to a gas mower, no fumes to bother me or the environment, and it does a great job of cutting and mulching. This is a very good product."
5,Great Mower !!,"I first bought this mower 10 years ago !!! Yes, it ran beautifully for that long. And, I really abused it. I mulched small sticks and pine cones of all sizes. It just kept going and mowing my lawn beautifully. When it finally slowed down, I gave it to my neighbors who really needed a goat instead of a mower and it's still doing the job. But! I loved it so much, I bought it again here on Amazon and am just as happy with it. This time, I think I will be kinder to my mower and expect it will run for 20 years! I also appreciated the very quiet sound, the easy start ;) and environmental kindness. I would give it SIX stars if I could, and will buy another when I need to. This mower is worth $500 ! Making it a GREAT bargain, too."
4,Good electric mower,"Great mower, has worked very well for several years now. A couple of points to consider:o The socket on the mower eventually failed, so I had to wire the cord directly into it. This seems to be an ongoing design issue with B&D; electric mowers, since it also happened on two previous models.o The instructions are a little unclear as to how to insert the plastic plugs under the handle ends, but keep messing with it, you'll get it.o The underside has a nonstick coating that works pretty well, but it does, eventually, build up grass clippings that are easy to scrape out with a stick or even your fingers (with the mower unplugged, of course!)o The wheels could be a little more durable - mine are starting to wear around the hubs so they're loose.o The elevation setting works well, except it's easy to bump, causing the mower to lower."
4,So far so good,"I purchased two of these lawnmowers a little over 3.5 years ago, one for my parents and the other for myself. They are both still running and haven't had any mechanical problems. What I really like is that I never need to buy gas or oil, they are largely maintenance free. The only downsides are that you have to watch out for where the cord is (which can be tricky if you have a lot of trees) and they are not as powerful as gas mowers. If the lawn is very long you may need to make two passes to do a good job."
4,Great lawn mower,My husband ordered this as we just moved into a new rental with a newly hydroseeded lawn. It's easy to use (even I can use it) and we recommend it!
4,Performs well,"Generally a great product. I would give it more than 4 stars, but less than 5. My issues:1. Since the handle does not tilt maneuvering it out of small places (i.e. basement door to the back yard) can be a bit tricky.2. I am afraid the blade is a little prone to rust. It must be kept clean.3. Be ware of power rating. The higher 12 amps on the mower in great in provoding extra power. HOWEVER, many extension cords and plugs in houses are only rated to 10 Amps. I had to buy a new higher rated extension cord (not provided)."
4,Quiet and dependable,"My neighbors tease me about 'sweeping' my lawn, but I love this thing. It's much quieter than any gas mowers I've owned, and it starts every single time I pull the lever. I have not experienced the vibration other reviewers mention.I mowed over my first cord two weeks after buying the mower, but there was more user error to blame than product design.For a quiet, clean, dependable mower, I recommend this one. If I could change one thing, it would be the width of the mower deck. A 22"" model would be awesome."
4,Electric Mower Review,"I was looking for an electric lawnmower because I found the gas one to be difficult to start and too heavy to push around our hilly yard. The electric mower met all my needs- starts at the flip of a switch and I (an average sized woman) can push it with one hand and moniter the cord with the other. On one hand, keeping up with cord is annoying, especially with a large, hilly yard. On the other hand, the other features of the mower make the cord merely a minor hassle. The mower was easy to assemble, with no tools required-- I put mine together while my crawling infant son and my preschooler ""helped""."
4,I'd say as described,"I bought the lawn hog MM575 for my house nad my friend's, which both are quite big. The first time I tried it, it was exellent, cutting the grass smooth with authority, though power is ADEQUATE, not plenty. The bagging system works great except the bag is too small and of bad quality. The cord is not a problem in my flat, plain lawn, but in my friends, which is full of bushes, the cord may become the main work."
5,Happy Mother's Day,I used this gift to myself for the first time on Mother's Day morning. I have never mowed a lawn and this mower was so wonderful and easy. The mower purrs and moves easily. I have bragged to everyone about the great time I had mowing and now everyone wants to try it. I will be like Huck Finn and let different people do my lawn whenever it needs mowing.
4,Quiet Electric Mowing,"The Black and Decker MM575 Electric Mulching Mower is a fine machine for moderate mowing jobs. It's about half as quiet as a motorized machine, and of course you don't have to contend with the associated starting problems and exhaust smells. For small to medium lawns, I would recommend it highly."
4,For smaller yards,"For whats its designed for it's great. My only complaint is it's 18"" cutting path, it would be nice to have 20"". I like not having gas in the garage and not taking it to have tune ups."
3,"It worked great for three years, then it died.","This mower is very quiet, easy to use (you just need to learn how to handle the cable) and I was happy with it for 3 years. It is not very powerful and that was annoying sometimes since I'm a bit lazy with my yard and I let it grow a bit long, then the mower will have more trouble cutting it. I would have to back back and forth on certain spots.Unfortunatley I was using it this past weekend and while going over one of those tough spots, it died. I removed the black plastic cover on top and noticed that one of the coils from the electrical motor was broken. I'm going to see how much it will cost to repair. I think this is a great lawn mower if you never let your grass grow much, so it is always easy on the mower. Otherwise, nothing beats the power of a gas mower."
1,Short life-span,"I've used this mower four times. First time out, loved it. Ran beautifully, easy to maneuver, cord a minor nuisance I could easily live with. Second time out, still loved it. Third time, the love started to diminish, as the slightest bump would jostle it enough to drop it to the lowest cutting level, effectively scalping the lawn. Fourth time out, it died 1/3 of the way through the job. I thought maybe it was jammed, cleared out some clippings, but no luck restarting. I'll try it again, see if it can be repaired, but if this one requires replacement I would not choose this mower again. Next time I'll choose either a cordless or gas model...the cord isn't so bad during the mowing process, but it's surprisingly heavy to lug around."
4,A bit fuzzy at first...,"I read this book for an assignment, and initially thought that it was a novel. Considering that the first two stories were both about Irene, I saw the short stories simply as chapters, until I read further on.While the connections between the stories are excellent, I found that I had a hard time identifying with the characters. Primarily, this was due to the fact that the author never explicily gives the stories a setting. After a few minutes, one can derive that the book is set near Kansas City, and by reading between the lines, one discovers that the time period is set at some point during the fifties.Despite this bit of ambiguity, however, I felt that the stories themselves were excellent. The problem with the setting is easily overcome by the excellent storytelling. Rattlebone is an excellent book."
4,A wonderful narrative about life in the midwest in the 50's.,"I thought this was a wonderful book revolving around the life of African Americans in the Midwest during the 1950's. I enjoyed the format of intertwining stories as seen through the eyes of the differant citizens of Rattlebone. I think my interest was peaked since I was born and raised in Kansas City (MO) where the fictional town of Rattlebone was and where Maxine Clair, the author, is also from. I am anxious to read other books by this author."
3,Easy to read story,"Rattlebone is a story about the life of a young girl growing up in the south. Its a beautiful story, easy to read. Will recommend this book to those who had a fun life as children and those who would like to know what is like to be living in the south."
3,Come On Now,"Ok now, I've been reading the reviews and for a real true Ice Cube musical fan, you would have to be kidding yourself if you are gonna say this is his best album ever. Please!!! Not to say this album stinks, but I look at this album as his groundbreaking, leaving NWA and need to get my feet wet on my own album; as this helped propel him to bigger and better things, including much better music and albums. Let's face facts Cube fans, though the lyrics are very good, (because Cube is a great rap writer along with rhyming) the beats are weak and lame, especially in contrast to his future albums as he got more popular and was able to make much better beats and sounds. Don't get me wrong though, there are a lot of good songs on this album. If you are a Cube fan, you must have this album since it was ""the beginning of his era"" in a way, as he was seperating himself from being just a member of N.W.A. to being known as Ice Cube the rapper, producer, businessman, actor, ........ICON."
3,Worth a listen,"Disclaimer: I am a white man in his mid-30s living in Utah. Not Mr. Cube's (as The New York Times would say) target audience.I've never heard rapping more explosive, more get-me-some-payback-NOW, than Ice Cube's work on ""Natural Born Killaz"" and ""Last Wordz"". (Both collaborations with 2pac, as it turns out.) I didn't find as much of that on this record as I'd hoped for. It's telling that the angriest track here, ""Endangered Species"", relies on guest mouth Chuck D. (kick it to 'em, Chuck!) for much of its juice. ""You Can't Fade Me"" is pretty funny (""No cigar, G!"") and ""Who's The Mack?"" is a classic, but there are too many songs that just aren't anything special. I'm too ignorant of the genre to judge, but if this record is a West Coast classic, I'll stay in Brooklyn, thanks."
2,Overrated album,"I was pretty much dissapointed with this album, I just did not like many of the tracks, except for ""once upon a time in the projects"" and 2 or 3 others, this album really falls short. For some reason every one I talked to says this is his best album, I don't know what they are thinking but I did not like this album one bit. In my opinion Cube's best albums were after this one, but was at his best with NWA. Nothing on this album will impress you."
1,Evidence of society's decline,"I don't get this stuff. Number one, it sure isn't music, not by a long shot. Second, it serves no positive purpose in society, and serves to add to the (seemingly growing) pot of negative influences.Taken at face value, the lyrics are horrendous, shameful, unthinkable. Looking deeper than face value, there may be some humor at play here, but if that is the case, then it is very, very sick humor. Like someone telling dirty jokes at a funeral.This is something that would never have made record store shelves back in more sane, honorable days."
4,Hip Hop Souvenir.,"I recently went out and bought this CD. If you listen to west coast rap. You must order this CD. This CD represents Ice Cube at the prime of his career. Ex-member of N.W.A,stereo-type gangsta, jherri curl, khaki wearing every other word is a four letter word and pursueing an acting career. I mean this guy was doing it all. And he still made it. I truely believe this is some of his best work. It was orignal and real. He wasn't just rapping, he was telling a story. If you lived in the 'hood you would understand what I mean. Track's like ""Who's the Macc,"" ""A Gangsta's Fairytale,"" ""Once upon a time in The Projects"" and ""It's a Man's World"". Classic, nothing but the best. If you are a rap fan this is one Cd that needs to be in your collection."
1,Disappointed,"The specs listed (size) is incorrect. I spend hours searching for a case smaller than 11.5"" they said it was 11.2 inches I ordered it and they sent me one 11.5 inches. Very Dissapointed."
4,Worked and fit properly,This is a replacement blade and it does just that. No complaints. It was relatively inexpensive and it went on with just one screw.
4,a cut above-almost,"RE: B&D replacement blade-received quickly -can't say it cuts Significantly better than my old blade re-sharpened but too many chips caused the need to replace-a good deal anyway considering time spent(wasted) looking local & the cost is close to a sharpening kit anyway-had considered a ""Higher Tech"" super mulcher BUT 2x the $ & couldn't find correct size center hole-for my electric it's ok"
5,"Needed it, found it, bought it, as easy as 1,2,3.","I needed the mower blade and couldn't find it anywhere in Memphis, so I went to the internet and found it easily. Also, didn't have to fight the traffic as it was delivered to my door. Right price too. I'll shop more this way in the future."
4,"Good product, shipping delays","This is an excellent value and works great.Buy two and keep the extra one sharp and ready to go when you need it.There were shipping delays, but I did finally receive the product."
4,Good enough to buy 2,"I bought a b&d electric mower a few years ago. I had no problems and learned how to manage the extension wires (cut only one) . I got the blade to replace the one I bent out of shape and it seemed fine... But shortly, probably due to my beating up the mower at home and office. It burned out. Bought two new ones. So far so good."
5,Excellent product.,"I bought an extra blade so I could replace the original while it got re-sharpened. The blade arrived quickly, and it was very easy to change. I expected the original to be in pretty rough shape after two years of use, but it was still in pretty good. I don't have a large lawn, so the use is limited, but I've run over my fair share of stones and other objects. All in all, I've been very pleased with the blade (mower, too, though the cord dance gets old)."
5,great experience,"The mower blade was of course brand new. It is not a real common size blade and to find it here, get it @ a great price and get such fast delivery was great. This was the first of many times I will use the service."
4,Good Blade,Replacement blade for the older Black and Decker Electric Lawn Mower .New in box .Works for me !!
2,More Shipping Woes,"""Usually ships in 24 hours"" isn't accurate. After 1 week from my order, Amazon is predicting another two weeks before shipping.While it's nothing to do with Amazon, I'm particularly disgusted that my local retailer, a large national chain (HD), doesn't even stock this item. My grass is getting pretty tall."
1,Amazon Packaging Problem,"Just bought the mower - so no need (yet) for the replacement blade, which was supplied in a manufacturers box 19""x2""x2""; but, was SHIPPED in a box (B05) which is 22""x5.5""x15"" -- and FILLED with paper 'packaging'! At first, I really didn't think there was anything IN it, BUT paper! Then, I received a 100' extension cord, by itself, in your another smaller (Z3)box - which could have accommodated BOTH items! Shame on Amazon! That's just NOT the way to do it anymore!!!!!"
4,mision pack,"This is a great way to get some very nice maps and an AT-ST. The maps are great, the mission pack is Ok. The AT-ST does not have any moving parts. For such a big mini I would at least expect the head to swivel. Other than that, the AT-ST is way more powerful than it's points would lead you to believe. It's almost overpowered."
4,A fun read,All the twist of a classic suspense novel with a bit of Haldeman hard sci-fi thrown in. This is one of the most entertaining books I have read in a long time.
4,Sinister & Haunting,"Although it lacks the edge of earlier Universal horror favorites, Dracula's Daughter has a finely tuned atmosphere which should appeal to fans of the genre-- as will Gloria Holden, who is unnervingly effective in the title role. Occasionally banned for its fairly obvious lesbian overtones, Dracula's Daughter is the perfect companion for the Bela Lugoisi original."
4,One of the best of the 1930's horror films.,"Gloria Holden has no difficulty convincing the viewer that she is Dracula's daugther, her raven hair and compelling gaze show it quite clearly. A really wonderful supporting cast includes Edward Van Sloan from the original Dracula, Irving Pichel as her very creepy servant, Otto Kruger as Dr. Garth and even a small role for Hedda Hopper. Though considered a B movie it far surpasses many on the A list."
2,"""Dracula"" Sequel Lacks Bite","Plagued by production delays, endless rewrites and Hays Office censorship, ""Dracula's Daughter"" (1936) remains among the lesser Universal chillers. Even worse, it's a ""Dracula"" sequel without Bela Lugosi - who was paid $4,000 for NOT appearing in this belated follow-up to the 1931 classic. Lambert Hillyer's atmospheric direction cannot mask a bloodless film that emphasizes comedy over terror. Worth seeing once for Gloria Holden's performance in the title role and Edward Van Sloan's welcome return as Van Helsing. A disappointing end to Universal's first horror cycle."
3,I never drink wine 2 hehe,"This is a classic old film from the 30's 1936 i think. It follows up after the end of the 1931 classic Dracula. Gloria Holden plays Dracula's daughter and disposes of the body of Dracula (which was killed off in the 31 film)by burning the body. She seeks the advise of a London doctor for help in her affliction but of course follows the same path as her father! She never drinks wine!! This is a good film and if you like the old style films then you will enjoy it. Now, it would have been much better if only James Whale would have been allowed to do this film but the movie company I understand did not like his scandelous ideas and so we never got to see what would have been. James Whale of course directed Frankenstein, Bride of Frankenstein, and the Invisible Man and even the Old Dark House!"
4,"""You know, this is the first woman's flat I've been in that didn't have at least 20 mirrors in it...""","Picking up the story literally moments after the events of the first ""Dracula"" starring Bela Lugosi, DRACULA'S DAUGHTER (1936) has always held a fascination, largely thanks to Gloria Holden's nuanced performance in the title role.Countess Marya Zaleska (Holden) is a beautiful member of the aristocracy with a dangerous secret; fits of uncontrollable bloodlust and the need to stalk and kill pretty young girls...not to mention a biological link to the old Count you-know-who. The sexual ambiguity of the Countess adds lots of dark layers in this moodily-lit horror favourite. The performances are very strong, particularly Otto Kruger, Marguerite Churchill and Irving Pichel as the Countess' menacing servant. Gloria Holden's subtle performance in the title role is a marvel to witness.Recommended."
5,"THIS WAS RAP'S FIRST DOUBLE ALBUM.... NOT 2 PAC ""ALL EYEZ""","If yall haven't recognized, this was Hip hop's 1st double CD!!! This cd was released in 1995. But alot of people say the 2 Pac's ""All Eyez On Me"" cd was the first, even though it was released the next year!!! I just wanted peeps to recognize that this is the true 1st double cd ever put out by a rap artist. I'm sure that the reason why MP didn't say anything is because he was such a Pac fan that he didn't want to mess up his legacy, but hell it's true. PEACE!!!"
3,Twin Switch - By: Carol Stanley,"Twins Alix ans Stacy Wyatt couldn't be more alike, yet are very different. Alix is an excelent violin player, and a very shy, unnoticed girl in Chicago. Almost two thousand miles away in California, Stacy is a popular, athletic, and well known person.Alix lives with her father and his girlfriend, Martine. She is a little unhappy with her life because of Martine. Stacy was unhappy with her life too with her mother, because she flunks geometry.Well, at a joint vacation to their grandmother's house, will change everything. The girls get a crazy idea to switch lives and fix what is wrong. While being the other person, Alix discovers she's a flirt, jock, and musician. Stacy falls in love with a guy her sister is afraid to talk to.They fooled everyone for now, but can they keep it up? They learned alot ""walking in the other persons shoes"", but at the end of the summer, will they go back home?This is a good book to read to relax. Not too much excitement, but not too boring."
4,This thing is awesome!,"I bought this one at Best Buy and then took it to Europe while I was on vacation. There, it was stolen, so I bought it again on amazon; and the price was so much better! This is an awesome CD player, mostly because of the remote control; making it so much easier that having to pick the whole unit up to change a song or change volume. Works very well with almost no skipping just be sure to push in the remote control plug all the way in or else it will not work. The only problem is that it is favored by French gypsies and other thieves."
5,Great Phone Minor Problem,"i have had this phone since april 2005 and i love it, its a good phone, my only problem is the lack of a good cell phone case, i have looked high and low but i cant find a case for under 30 bucks, body glove only offers a case for this phone on the sprint web site."
1,Very disappointed,"I purchased this phone a little more than a week ago. Once I finally received the phone I was quite disappointed. I charged as the recommendations say and then turned the phone on. To my suprise i was in analog roam at my apartment in downtown Pittsburgh where my Samsung A-460 has a decent digital reception. So, I took it to the Sprint store where they reprogrammed it. Sadly, the reception still wasnt any better than my Samsung. So, I called a friend to test the phone out, albeit good clear reception, but a horrible feedback from the speaker phone. Plus the phone book is a pain in the butt to get to. I love my Samsung in the fact i just have to hit the scroll down key to scroll my address book. Good luck if you choose this phone."
1,Too Many Dropped Calls,I have an older Sanyo phone that works a lot better than this unit. I have never had a phone that dropped calls as often as the RL-7300.
2,POS,"This is another POS cell phone from Sprint who haven't had a decent phone since they stopped selling the more reliable and rugged Motorola StarTac. This phone is just slightly better than the equivalent Samsung and LG models which I've owned prior to purchasing this phone. Some six months after purchase the #2 doesn't work, it has always lost signal in places where other people have signal and the button to change the ringer volume or to set it to vibrate gets caught on things or comes under my fingers when talking causing it to change at inopportune times."
1,Poor quality phone,I would not reccomend anyone buy this phone. The receive signal strength is very low compared to other Sprint phnoes I have used. It tends to drop calls and allow calls to roll directly to voice mail. The battery life is not nearly what is advertised. This phone sucks down all of the battery with only a few phone calls. It will not last me a full business days worth of calls. I estimate the actual talk time is about 1-1/2 hours without using Ready Link or the net. Ready Link kills the battery very quickly.
1,not happy at all,"Maybe I just had bad luck with this phone but I would not buy it again. I think it has some sort of a switch problem, After 5 months the outside screen just stopped working. And then because the switch wasn't working, when I closed the phone, the inside screen would stay on all the time and drain my battery. Sprint replaced it with another RL-7300, and after 2 months the second phone stopped working in the exact same way. Sprint advertises this phone as being ""rugged"" and I feel it's not. I take care of my phone so I don't believe these phones stopped working through any fault of mine. My old Samsung lasted 2 1/2 years. I'm considering buying a Samsung again."
5,Best phone I've used,"I got this phone to replace a Samsung that got lousy reception. The Samsung would drop calls, and left people asking me to repeat myself. I decided to go with this phone after seeing strong reviews for it on the internet. That's why I'm surprised to see some people here say they didn't get good reception with this phone. I think it's very well designed and rugged....I know it's going to last me years. I get good reception no matter where I go (I'm in the Atlanta area and take trips to D.C. and NY). Maybe there's a lot of bad units that get shipped with manufacturers. I never liked my Samsung, and replaced it with the same model when I thought it could be the model. The replacement would get lousy reception as well. I have a couple friends who use that model Samsung, but they don't seem to have the same problems. Sanyo seems to work for me better, and I notice it emmits less radiation then Samsung models."
5,Clarinent Wizardy,"I was at a friends house casualy listening to music in the background and I couldn't help but notice the sound of this clarinent, the likes of which I never heard before. In fact until then I really didn't regard the clarinent very highly as a jazz instrument. But after hearing Alvin Batiste play his version of Body and Soul (solo), I was hooked, and immediately ordered a copy of Late. Unfortunately, that's the only cd or LP he made, he has been a sideman on ther's releases, but did only one solo piece. His tone and dexterity are unique and he is the only clarinentist I have any music by!!! If you haven't heard him before, you are in for a treat the first time you listen to him play. This is the kinda music that is an exlir for the soul!!! ENJOY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,A great book for beginners!,"When I was new to French, I saw this and started learning. It helped me on how to get my pronunciation right, and reading at a normal French speed. It helps you in every situation you may bump into in France - from the Passport Control to the Travel Agency! Everything's here! Once you're finished with this, it's best to continue with French In Three Months. I did the same thing and now, I speak French fluently! Bonne chance!"
3,Good mower unless you have an uneven lawn,"One of the problems we've found with this mower is that the height adjustment lever will rachet down to the lowest setting half way through cutting the lawn. This happens in a faster timeframe if you have an uneven back lawn that's slightly hilly. Unless you like your grass closely cropped if may be worth checking out other mowers that have better height adjustment levers (for example something that is easy to lock in and not slide out, as what happens with this model). Apart from that its easy to clean although I thought the diagrams in the manual were pretty misleading on the first glance at them."
4,Nice mower in general,"Bought the mower a couple of months ago and have been using it to mow the lawn, typical city lawn attached to a corner individual house. Works well plenty of power and is quiet enough. Problems: When used in chute mode, the chute fell off often when brushing against most anything, the mower is much too heavy, and would be more convienient if it had a flip handle."
5,Great product,I've been using this mower for 6 years now. It is my first corded electric mower. I still get tangled in the cord once in a while but i don't consider this an issue with the mower. It's light weight and easy to manuver. It gives a very good cut in our VERY thick Zoysia grass lawn. It would be nice if the plug had some kind of locking mechanism to keep it from falling out. I fixed this by attaching a dedicated extension cord to the mower and zip tying the plug/cord to the handle so it never falls out now. I just wrap the cord around the mower handle after each use. I have never used the bagger attachment so i can not comment on that feature. One thing i've noticed is the cutting path is not as wide as the mower deck as with gas powered mowers. So i need to overlap my rows closer. This mower is perfect for my needs.
2,Don't buy,We bought this mower about two years ago. I was cutting our grass this evening when suddenly the mower quit. Smoke started billowing up from the motor housing. We have a small yard and hours of usage over the last couple of years has been minimal. I have regularly cleaned and maintained the mower. I thought it would be awhile before I would be shopping for another lawn mower. Guess not. I can tell you one thing. My next mower will not be a Black and Decker.
2,Slow Go,We enjoy several Black and Decker yard tools. But any corded electric lawn mower requires cumberson 180 degree turns to accomodate the cord. Cut out the cord and cut your time in half.
1,very bad cheaply made thing,I have thi product little bit more than one year. First year everything was good and perfect. I was so happy!!! But it was not too long. My little mashine on second year did bring me a lot of problems and big headache. It 's really made very cheaply.If you don't want each year buy new lawnmower forget for buying this one...
4,Black & Decker Electric Lawn Mower,"Black & Decker 18-Inch 9 Amp Electric Mulching Mower #MM275This is a great mower for a small lawn. It is quiet, quite powerful and is easy to push. It has several settings for adjusting the blade height. The only draw back is watching out to make sure you don't run over the power cord while mowing. I would definitely recommend this mower. It is very female friendly!"
4,Let me begin by saying that I am the Queen of mowing.....,"I have bought and tried so many mowers in the past,from 4 stroke gas weed trimmers, to the ""Big Wheel"" models( Sears and DR). But never an electric mower. After reading all the reviews on Amazon, I decided to try the Black and Decker electric mulching mower. For a small(less than a quarter acre) fairly flat yard, this baby works!Yeah, no more noisy, gas powered machines to disturb my neighbors! This was an Earth Day gift to myself, and I am very pleased with it. The cord is not too much of a problem, if you stay alert and watch your pattern of mowing.For the price, it's a great deal.If you want to spend more, the cordless model(battery powered) would be the way to go. But really, how can you go wrong w/ any Black & Decker?!"
4,"B&D 18"" Electric Mulching Mower #MM275",This is a great lawnmower. It is very light and easy to use. A quality cut. My only concern is that the safety lever pinches my hand everytime I use this lawnmower.
4,Great mower!,"After moving to a house with a much smaller yard, I decided to downsize from my previous Lawn Hog to the MM275 and I'm very happy with it. It has more than enough power, is lightweight, easy to handle and does a great job. I'd had my Lawn Hog for about 5 years and love the convenience and no-maintenance of the electric mowers. The mulching action is a definite plus and I haven't had to rake any cut grass at all."
1,The MM275 is cheap and flimsy,"I bought the Black And Decker MM275 based only on an Amazon recommendation. Within minutes of using this lawn mower I knew that my purchase of the MM275 was a mistake.Cons:* The bar height is not adjustable. I'm 5'11"", and the bar is below my waist, which is uncomfortable.* The power switch is mushy soft plastic, like a chew toy for a dog. This essential part feels like it will break within a year, and reviews of similar Black And Decker lawn mowers say that it does.* The power connector doesn't have a lock or clip, so the power cord falls out. You'll need to tape or glue the power cord to the switch housing.* The motor is under-powered. I had to mow my lawn twice to get an even cut.* The shroud has a big nose. You can't do edges with this mower.Pros:* Very light. You can mow with one hand."
2,"Not easily manouverable, handle doesnt fold in for storage","Basic lawn mower, low noise, good for beginners, single handle height adjustment is good.But build quality is strictly ok. Grass is not always cut evenly but then it maybe because I am a beginner.Handle doesn't fold in so storage in shed is an issue.I wish the front or back tires had turn capability because maneuvering this is a pain."
4,"Nice mower for the price, but....","If you have a small lot, this mower would be perfect. I bought this mower for my new house (just moved in August). I like the mower and how it operates (super light weight, cuts/mulches very well, quiet and no smelly gas fumes), but the issue is I underestimated how big my yard is. I thought my lot was about 1/4 acre, but its actually more like a third acre because I'm on the corner. The 18"" cutting width makes for too many passes and takes a long time to complete the job. But nothing wrong with the mower."
4,Helpful,"The most helpful part of this study guide was the disc for practice tests. It simulated exactly how the exam would be, and also had some of the same questions."
4,Great Book,"This book came just in the neck of time, I needed it right away. It helped me and i felt very confident. Thanks"
2,a little help,"This book is NOT enough to pass the CLEP. It IS easy to read and does provide much knowledge. HOWEVER, I would have failed had I relied solely on this book. I also used Peterson's CLEP Success which helped me pass the exam much more than this book. I would suggest using them both."
2,Do yourself a favor,"I urge all of you to use this study guide in addition to other history and social science study materials. The book does cover a lot of the exam material but this exam is worth 6 credits and you want to be prepared as possible. I scored a 61, but that was with a lot of studying."
3,Easy reading but probably not enough to pass.,"I used this book in addition to another study guide (mostly the other one actually) to do well on the test. This book is easy to understand and read, but alone it's probably not enough information. It gives you a good general idea, but you need to know more than just that for the test."
3,Do not use this book alone for test!,"This book gave me a general idea of what would be on the CLEP test, but when I actually took the test, the exam questions were MUCH harder then the review questions in the book. I passed, but would not recommend using this book alone!"
4,Suitable for parents of children above ten,"This book is very suitable to parents of children above ten years, but as a parent to a three and four years old, I did not find it much helpful. How can I teach toddlers to sit down and write together our mutual goals and seek ways to achieve them!!I kept this book up in one of my shelves for future reference, I think I will benefit from it later."
4,Formula,Johnson uses a basic formula to his books then fine tunes the same message to different audiences. That said I love the book Despite the predictablility the message is worth the journey. Especially The dual message of we and I goals. The objective being to create a win win position for family members.
5,Great buy,"Great book - plain and simple. Edition was in nearly perfect shape too, so no issues there. Go for it."
2,Russian School of Physics,"This book has few uses. The book is so abbreviated that you need two other books to understand it. The one useful feature of this book is the problems with solutions, but even those take a lot of deciphering."
2,The Mummy Shuffle,"Universal monsters never perish as Kharis rises from the dead (in Massachusetts, of all places) and kills the surviving characters from ""The Mummy's Hand."" Despite George Robinson's moody camera work and the sinister presence of Turhan Bey, ""The Mummy's Tomb"" (1942) takes cost-cutting horror to a new low. Lon Chaney Jr. does his best with the Ace bandages, but cannot overcome Harold Young's bland direction and recycled footage from earlier Universal productions - including mismatched shots of the torch-bearing villagers in ""Frankenstein."" Though Kharis went down in flames, the Mummy Shuffle would continue for two more sequels."
3,"ENTER LON CHANEY JR. IN THESE SILLY, BUT FUN SEQUELS!","'The Mummy's Tomb' is a sequel to 'The Mummy's Hand'. The story takes place 30 years after 'The Mummy's Hand' leaves off. Clocking in just over an hour in length, this film spends the first 12 minutes in flash back to 'The Mummy's Hand'! The next 3 minutes in a redundant ritual of the passing of the throne as keeper of the tomb. Even with a quarter of the movie being nothing new, this film is still fun! The Mummy make-up looks good even if Chaney looks a little chunky(;-D)and there is some good atmosphere in this short and sweet romp through mummy-ville.I rate it 2 3/4 Stars for fun factor...who can resist these silly films? This is available on DVD on the Mummy Legacy collection and on a double bill with The Mummy's Hand."
2,Not as bad if one values the cinematics over the literal,"The best thing this film has going for it, is the cinematic flourishes of once master DP George Robinson. Each frame after the other is beautifully composed and lit to perfection. In a film like this--rountine plot, tepid, dull, flat direction, and some rather dry, dim-witted acting. Why care? So just sit right back and saver the visual poetry and the technique that went into it all. The real Star is Robinson, forget about Harold Young. He was just some untalented hack director who got the job becasue Universal couldn't afford to hire any of the big-guns...u know like James Whale, Edgar G. Ulmer, Robert Siodmak..ect ect. Altold, on a pictorial stand-point, The Mummy's Tomb ranks as one on Universal's best looking chillers of the 1940's. Yet when it all boils down to the facts, what a visually dazzaling film becomes, is an embaresment to what was one of Universal's biggest grossing films of 1942."
2,Not as good as the others,"""The Mummy's Tomb"" is most definitely the worst of all the mummy films. All the mummy does is ""desecrate all those who defiled the tomb of Ananka"". The way the killings are represented is just horrible because they come with no exciting turning points. The other thing about this movie is the fact that it is a review of what has happened in all this past time.And as the killings slowly come to an end, the priest commanding Kharis is simply murdered by a gunshot, not because he betrays Kharis. I don't know why it is so, but it always seems better when the priests are killed by betraying Kharis. Plus, the mummy makes a stupid looking and boring escape, and isn't closely dealt with by the ""star"" of the show, which was meant to be the actor playing John Banning."
4,Great story of courage and overcoming obstacles.,"This film has been a staple in our home since my (now mostly grown) four children were young. There were many discussions that followed viewing this filem, and many ""lessons"" learned ... from always letting someone know where you are (!), to working your hardest at surviving against many odds. We've always loved this movie."
1,The story that got lost in itself,"Started out great (Tallis as a child, becoming aware, learning, exploring) but as soon as she crossed over the borderlands of Lavondyss (pg. 197) it fell apart becoming a tangled tortuous mess. The story got lost in itself. There was no sense of place or being. The characters lacked character. I felt absolutely nothing for them or Lavondyss.After reading the first 194pg build up I anticipated a great journey. I was bitterly disappointed DISENCHANTED is more like it!Needless to say I won't be reading the rest of the Mythago series."
3,Good for a While,"This book was good... For some time. But after about 100 pages it falls apart. The intro. Is great, and is one of the best beginings I ever read! Its about a guy talking to a ghost. But then it loses it compleatly. Stick to Mythago Wood."
2,Read before you buy!,"I thought that this was an easy and fun way to learn french, but I got more than I bargained for. the woman sounds like a creepy sudctress, and learning how to say Hey baby is not what i'd call appropriate. Needless to say, use caution before you buy this book."
5,Accurate and Beautiful,"Can't beat Seiko accuracy. Still within one second of USNO time after 7 months. Nice band and beautiful styling. Looks like a million for mere dollars. ""Timeless"" design as it will fit any situation. ""After six"" looks but looks great any ""time"". It's a watch for the average guy. So, if you are the hulkish type... the band will be too small."
5,"of course ,it is Seiko,","Seiko Men's Watch #SFWD24classic, yet elegant, you can't go wrong with Seiko Name. Highly recommend it."
3,"Not the best, not the worst","After reading almost all of Dr. Kellerman's books, I decided to buy a copy of this one. No particular reason - I don't have children, but I have two nephews I adore, and I thought that I could read this to them when I saw them. At best, I'd say it's an average childrens' book - not as engaging as, say, Dr. Seuss, but not horrible. The pen-and-ink drawings are nice, too, if a bit cartoonish. And for Jesse Kellerman fans, it's worth checking out for one of Jesse's earliest works."
2,Disapointed,"I must admit I very disappoint with this purchase not with the program but all 4 DVD were corrupted I clean them and they still did play correctly, I put in another DVD and no problem. I'm just the kind of person who hates to sent stuff back but that me no fault of Amazon. I will still buy from Amazon what I could view from the DVD was great and I cook a couple of the recipes shown ."
3,Surprisingly entertaining,"Although panned by critics, this sequel to ""The Mummy's Tomb"" is nonetheless interesting and enjoyable. Although it is not clear why, George Zucco is back (after having been shot in ""The Mummy's Hand"" and apparently dying in ""The Mummy's Tomb""). This time, he sends John Carradine forth to recover the mummies of Kharis and Ananka, and Carradine essays his role rather well. With all due respect to Lon Chaney Jr., he was always best when portraying mute characters, and his performance in this picture is quite good. I would also agree wholeheartedly with the two previous reviewers who praise Ramsey Ames; her beauty and talent certainly add to the enjoyability of this film. Unfortunately for Kharis, Yousef Bey, like his predecessor, falls for the reincarnated (and apparently irresistible) Ananka, which arouses the wrath of Kharis. All in all, it's an enjoyable outing, with an original twist at the end. Get it - you'll like it!"
3,My First Dose of Life's Reality,"""The Mummy's Ghost"" was the first film I saw, at age 7, which taught me that things don't always end in a nice happy way. The ending wasn't what we kids were used to seeing. Such an outcome places this feature a cut above the rest of the 1940s Universal Mummy movies."
2,Mummy Malaise,"A slight improvement over the incredibly padded ""The Mummy's Tomb,"" this 1944 sequel finds Kharis (Lon Chaney Jr.) rising from the Massachusetts ashes in his undying quest for eternal love. The presence of John Carradine and George Zucco plus an effective swamp climax make this routine chiller worth enduring. Already on its last bandages, the final installment of the Universal series - ""The Mummy's Curse"" (released in December 1944) - gave Kharis a well-deserved rest."
3,ANOTHER FUN ROMP THROUGH MUMMY-VILLE!,"Ok, By this third installment in the Mummy series the story is getting a little redundant but, who cares!? If you watch these films, you have probably grown up with them. This is Lon Chaney Jr.'s second outing as the Mummy and like the other two films you really can't recognize him under all that terrific ever changing make-up. Surprisingly enjoyable for fans of this atmospheric series, the best part of the film is the memorable ending with the Mummy and his rapidly aging princess sinking into the swamp. I rate this film 2 1/2 stars. A great spooky starter for a Halloween night horror fest. This is available on DVD on the Mummy's Legacy collection and on a double bill DVD with The Mummy's Curse. The DVD transfer is very good."
4,The Mummy's rampage continues,"For a trip down memory lane to the Saturday afternoon matinee watch all the mummy serial films of the 40's. The Mummy's Ghost is the third entry in the series. Actually completed in 1943, just see date in opening credits, this film was released in 1944. Kharis the mummy's search for his long lost love and his New England rampage continue. John Carradine has a wonderful turn as the next high priest to take the mantle from George Zucco, who apparently finally dies this time. Lon Chaney makes his second appearance as the mummy and the ending is a shocker."
3,Mummy formula with plenty of holes,"In this movie, the 3rd Mummy sequel, There was no ghost and barely a mummy. I think they tried to put too much in too little of time (61 minute running time.) The dialog was stilted and conclusions were drawn without even an emphasis of a clue. The mummy makeup was so well done that they could have put Clem Kadiddlehopper (Red Skelton TV 50s) in the outfit instead of Lon Chaney Jr.Lets face it professors should not mess with leaves. Yep mummies just love them and it is always the local girl Egyptian girl that gets in trouble.However it is part of the mummy mystique and needs to be viewed at least once. Notice the white streak in Amina Mansouri's/Ananka's hair after she faints from shock. Also notice that even though she did not get to slurp on any leaf juice she still gets wrinkled in the swamp water to possible emerge as a different actress in the next sequel ""The mummy's Curse""; which by the way takes a little time more to do things a little better."
3,For collectors only,This movie offers nothing new the mummy goes looking for his lost princess and kills whomever gets in his way.
3,From Adam to Armageddon,Book came in good shape but a week late. Customer service was good and had already issued a refund.
1,Horrible!,"Worst SF book ever, Shatner's Tekwar series is better (that should give you an adequate view of how bad this is). Generic, confusing, and fragmented."
5,Great cookbook for everyday cooking,I use this cookbook all the time! It has easy recipes that taste great. Everyone always raves about how I can make an ordinary meal taste wonderful. My secret is this cookbook. I have also given this cookbook to several friends who all agree that this is one cookbook you can't do without.
1,This book leaves you hungry.,"Read Billy Graham if you want biblical passages and testimonials about lost teenaged souls saved (Halleluah!) by a single, profound word, perfectly delivered by the saintly author.Only 1 chapter dealt, superficially, with the title. The entire discussion of their marketing strategy is explained away in a few paragraphs as a fun idea by a wacky ad agency. Oh, boy. The author and his wife are obviously lovely and generous people who have devoted much to young people. Can read in an hour if you skip the Bible verses and the repeat episodes of piety. File this under ""Inspirational Reading,"" not business success stories."
1,not reliable,"I've had this mower for 2 years. I've had it repaired twice. The first year the switch broke. By the second year, the brushes were worn out and needed to be replaced. Each time the wait for parts took 3-4 weeks and I had to borrow a mower repeatedly from a friend while I waited. Luckily I live in a big city and there were actually authorized repair shops only about 20 minutes away. If you don't, you my be in for an unpleasant surprise when you need service. I have spoken to customer service at Black and Decker several times and received conflicting information about the warranty and whether such fast wear on the brushes is normal. The warranty is up in a few weeks and then I will have to pay for the next fix myself. I don't know if I will pay to repair it or pitch it out. I thought these electric's would be less trouble than gasoline engines, but I was very wrong about this model."
2,Cheap in both price and quality,"What I like about this mower: It's lightweight and quiet compared to gas mowers. It's very easy to assemble, so you can get to mowing within minutes. Unfortunately, the cons outweigh the pros. The area where the electrical cord attaches to the mower is loose and in an area prone to pulling during regular mowing. This means that the cord is constantly coming loose, cutting off power to the mower. Also, the motor seems very weak. The grass in my small yard was about 3 to 4 inches long when I used this mower. It often folded down blades of grass rather than cutting them, resulting in the need to mow over the same areas multiple times. Whenever the grass seemed even slightly denser, the motor seemed to struggle, making a lower sound and leaving more blades uncut. Although my yard is only about 20 feet by 10 feet, I was very frustrated by the time I got finished. In short, this felt more like a toy mower than the real thing."
4,So Far Great Little Mower For The Money,"I've mowed twice with this mower, and so far, it has been a little champ and you can't beat the price I paid! I have a relatively small yard, and I would not recommend this for a large yard. It is what it is, and it gets a little bogged down if you let the grass get a bit too high...that's why I gave it 4 Stars. If you have a small yard, and you're looking for a lightweight mower that will get the job done quickly, then this is your mower. The only thing I don't enjoy is moving the cord around, but it beats all the mess, stink and aggravation of a gas mower and is a lot cheaper (price wise) than a cordless mower. All in all, given all the pros and cons, I would definitely buy it again!"
4,"Nice mower, height adjustment lever didn't hold.","My unit keeps dropping to the lowest height. Otherwise, it's a solid mower.It's very quiet, no exhaust to smell. Very powerful, mowed a patch of land full of weed in no time."
3,ok purchase,this turned out to be rather cheap looking got late in the year will see how it works next summer was a cheap price so
4,works for me,Black & Decker LM175 18-Inch 6-1/2 amp Electric MowerMy electric lawn mower died and I was short on cash. Best deal available here in stores was pricey. Amazon.com offered best deal delivered--saved $100. Mower was out of box and running perfectly--my son had most of yard done by time I came home from work.
3,Missing parts,Mower arrived in a timely fashion but when the box was opened. The hardware to assemble the handle was missing. Amazon refered me to Balck annd Decker who ordered the parts that I need to put the handle together but it will take 2-3 weeks for me to received these items.
4,"For a small lawn, convenient and quiet","Works great for my small lawn, 10' by 20'. It was quieter than I expected, and does a nice even cut ( so far, with it's new sharp blade!). The variable height mechanism is easy to use. It's relatively easy to clean up after cutting, tho' grass bits get stuck in one spot and disappear inside...to who knows where. The power cord is no problem, I've 40 years experience pushing a vacuum cleaner, so it's easy."
1,Product lasted less than 2 years,"Initially we loved this quiet, easy to use mower. But less then 2 years later the mechanism in the handle used to start and keep the mower going does not work. Since it is all enclosed we will have to break it open to try to fix it."
2,Disappointing,"Strengths: Relatively inexpensive; good cutting-height control mechanism, excellent release for quickly stopping the blade.Weaknesses: The optional bag does not stay on the mower; the handles are not adjustable, resulting in hunched mowing (for a 6'2"" person) and excessive storage space requirement; the electric cord holder is ineffective and does not allow flexible placement of cord.Comments: This very basic mower has some innovative features, but lacks some very useful, old features. It gets the job done, but I would pay more in the future for a better designed mower. I recommend buying a different mower."
5,great product,This product is lightweight and easy to use . I am an older female and had trouble starting a gas mower. This is just plug in and go. So easy.This is my second electric mower. My first one gave me 18yrs of trouble free service and I am sure this one will also.
4,Electric mower,I am very satisfied with the grass cutting of electric mower. My only issue is the extension cord is very awkward. I wish a product was available that would pull the extension cord in and out as you cut the lawn. A product with a spring similar to what they have with vacuum cleaner.
5,Gets the job done!,"I am a single woman and did not want to deal with a gasoline mower. Yes, its a pain to watch out for the cord, and its kinda heavy to push, but it really gets the job done. My back yard doesn't have a perfect lawn---and it cuts through those tough weeds beautifully!! For the price, its awesome."
5,Great Product,"I have a small yard area with grass. This is a great lawn mower for a small yard. Very easy to clean up. Don't have to deal with gas, changing oil, etc. Just have to be careful with the electrical cord."
5,'Great Mower,"I live in Las Vegas and have a very small grass area in my back yard. I purchased this mower and am completely happy with it. It is super lightweight and quiet. It is easy to operate and very easy to push. If you are looking for a lawnmower to use for a small grass area, this is the one. And there is no gas smell or hard starts. This mower is great!"
3,"Good mower, but it didn't last long.","I bought this mower 5 years ago, and it lasted only 3 years. The motor is not well designed and its quality is low. One of the thin wire snapped off, and it's not worth fixing. Buying a new motor costs more than buying a new mower. As always, replacement parts are ridiculously overpriced. If you decide to buy this mower, and plan to use it for more than a couple years, I suggest buying 2 of them. One to use, the other one for part replacements.If your lawn is about 5000sq ft, and you mow about twice a month, 4 months a year, this mower should be fine. But if you mow weekly and you have thick, well maintained lawn, I suggest paying more for MM875. It's more powerful and includes a bag, which costs additional $30-$40 for the LM175 model."
4,Great mower for the price,"We have a riding mower for our very large corner lot. This Black & Decker mower, however, is perfect for the tight spots around flower beds, in a narrow area between the fence and the house and along the fence line. It cuts down on some of the weed whacking needs too. Being plastic is a plus for high humidity weather where anything metal usually rusts. It's light weight and easy to maneuver. As a woman, I do not like to ""maintain"" mowers that use gasoline and oil. It starts quite easily as well. I would definitely recommend this product for a small yard or as a second mower."
5,B&D Electric Mower,"I'm a 60 year old woman and had to get a muscular male friend to put the handle in the slots because I wasn't strong enought do do it. It starts up easy, mows & mulches better than any mower I've had. Be sure & order the bag attachment, I was continually turning the mower off to clean out the ""chute"" because the grass kept geting stuck in it."
4,"Excellent little, but powerful, mower","I bought this mower six months ago and it is exactly what I needed. For a small, California lawn, it is ideal. My neighbors stand and watch as I use it -- perhaps they've never before seen a woman of mature age whisking around on her lawn, pushing mower with one hand, holding cord with other? All with only a lovely purring sound from the little dream machine, rather than the roar of gas-powered mowers in our all-too-adjacent California yards. The convenience factor is fabulous -- just squeeze the handle and you're underway. To create my own ""mulching"" effect, I followed the suggestion of a previous reviewer (thank you, kind soul) and simply make a few rounds in the opposite direction from the mowing direction, after I finish, thereby cutting through any residual clipping residue. My lawn benefits from the mulch and I don't have to bother with raking or bag emptying. To sum it up: this mower is a little champ!"
5,Electric Mower,"I like this mower. My dad purchased a Black and Decker electric mower years ago and he is still using it. This was my main reason for picking this brand. I like the lighter weight of this mower compared to a gas powered one, plus the ability to store it sideways when not in use to conserve room. That can't be done with a gas mower. The extension cord takes a little getting used to if your past experience is gas mowers but if you follow the instructions, it's relatively easy to mow. I also like that this machine is quieter than a gas mower, and no fumes."
4,Just dandy!,"This electric mower is just the thing I needed for mowing close to the foundation of my house, around shrubbery and curb-side mowing. I plan my cutting route so that the cord is usually behind me and it works out fine for me. No need to use the weed-eater in most instances after I've used my electric mower, which is a plus. Just hop on the lawn tractor and away I go!! And I love products by Black and Decker. Made in the USA and great prices. Have had the mower for 3+ years now, and no problems with it at all. I highly recommend this item for small and large lawns if you have a riding mower to tackle larger areas!"
5,handy dandy,Very impressed with the quality and durability.It's great for getting into corners and other tight spots. Much easier than a bigger heavier machine.
3,"Okay, but underpowered","I would give this mover five stars, except it pretty much died after one season. Three stars for lasting a whole season, because I cut a lot of fairly high grass with it. But if you mow a large area, or mow infrequently and therefore have high grass to cut, get the slightly pricier model with a more powerful motor."
2,Died in less than a year.,The lawn mower stopped working about a 11 months of use. Our lawn is medium/large and it seemed the lawn mower could handle the lawn with no problems. Suddenly today it just stopped working (confirmed this was not an electrical cord or outlet issue...yes its the lawn mower that stopped.) Our lawn is not a huge thick lawn either- its average for Florida. Last week it was smoking so we should have taken that as a sign of the end.
5,black & decker lawn mower,enjoying this item...i hope it lasts as long as my last one- 25 years.i would certainly recomend this to anyone with a small yard.
5,need help,My husband and I bought an electric mower 2 years ago and we recently tried to change the blade. We cannot find any blades nor can we take the present blade off.. we love our mower and would not trade it for anything. Can you please help me with my problem. thank you very much
1,its too bulky,"I had this mower for a long time. I think 4 years or so. I HATE IT. IT IS TOO BULKY, HEAVY AND TOO MUCH TROUBLEMANAGING THE CORD WHILE MOWING THE LAWN. WISH I COULD SELL IT AND GET A SMALLER MOWER.I MOW A SMALL LAWN IN THE CITY. 2 SMALL STRIPS AND A SMALL AREA UNDER MY WINDOW.AN ELECTIRIC MOWER TETHERED TO THE CORD IS NOT WORTH THE PROBLEMS: IE MOWING OVER THE CORD CAUSING A BAD SPARK AND TRIPING THE BREAKER.NEVER AGAIN.I'D RATHER BUY GAS"
1,Broken after 1 year,"It produced a lot of smoke and it 's completely dead after one year of purchase. Basically, it was used less than once per month in the summer. What a crap !!"
3,Didn't last long,"I bought this mower 4 years ago, and have used electrics my whole life. I'm a big electric mower fan. I was happy with this one until it just plain-out and died last year. Could not be fixed. I was disappointed that it had only lasted 3-4 years.My lawn is about 1/2 acre of short weeds and some grass (nothing manicured or mono-culture here!). I mowed often, and mowed high if the grass was long. Did everything right...and it still didn't last.I plan on getting the $200 model this year and hope it will have a longer life-time than the this one."
4,great mower and NO GAS!,"I bought this mower as an alternative to a gas powered mower as i do a lot of woodworking in my garage and I didn't want any more combustable materials in my garage than necessary. This mower is a dream come true. It's light, easy to use and does just as well as a gas powered mower. It does tend to bog down in tall, thick grass but only if you push it too fast. I've been using one for three years now and the only thing I've done is replace the blade. And I bought a longer power cord. ;)"
2,Doesn't Last!,"I bought this exact mower in Jan. 2007, was very pleased with it and used it about once a week for half an hour to do my yard. Hardly what anyone would call a tough work-out for a mower. It worked for the summers of 2007 and 2008 and then made it through about a month of 2009 before the motor went. Since it only had a 2 year warranty, that was the end. I've had cheapie gas mowers that lasted for 15 years, so for me this was a pretty lousy investment."
5,Great light work mower!,"I have a shallow yard with hearty grass. This mower plus a good long extension cord (and careful attention to where that cord is when I'm mowing) make this the PERFECT mower for me. I've had it now for two years, and its still running great! This is a great option for a shallow or small yards, and is definitely better than storing gasoline, or the maintenance of a gas mower."
4,Has its ups and downs,"Being light weigh, inexpensive, easy to put together and simple to adjust height this is most likely a good buy. It is really to use, turns off and on super quick and easy. However, the cord (which is not included) can get in the way and a little annoying at times. You must be sure to set the height of the mower to the right level of the grass, otherwise it will start smoking. Also, if you live in a small community like me, everyone will see you out mowing your lawn with this plastic thing that just eminates the message ""I'm poor, and this is the best lawn mower I can afford."" It is a little embarrassing to have neighbors see me mowing with a a cord following me around, and they come and offer to let me borrow their lawn mowers. So it that is what your town is like and you care about that kind of image, this is not the product for you, but if you don't care, by all means, this mower will do the trick."
2,Promising Grass Cutter,Difficult to fnd a power cord to work with the mower. Mower was moderately light in difficulty to assemble.
1,Caught on fire!,"Within a minute of using my lawn mower it just stopped and I smelled smoke, engine caught on fire. I must have go a dud but I don't want to just exchange it for another to just not work again. Returning it through amazon today."
4,Low Power,"This is a great mower. I really like it despite the fact it is a bit underpowered, and has trouble getting through heavy/tall grass. Now that I have it, and have used it, I also don't like dragging the electric cord around, and should have bought a battery operated mower. I would also recommend purchasing the grass catcher with it, otherwise the next time you mow, the mower has trouble getting though the old cut grass."
4,"Works great, quiet, lightweight, cord is sort of a pain.","I've been using this mower a few weeks now, and I like it.1) Compared to gas mowers, it's very lightweight. I have a very steep slope in my side yard, and the light weight makes quick work of mowing that section. With anything heavier, I would have a tough time and2) I wouldn't feel so safe. Also, the start lever makes a very nice safety feature because the motor only runs as long as your hands are on the handle, and it shuts off very quickly if you should lose your grip.3) The cord is kind of a pain, I've already run over and cut one, but I've learned my lesson and it's getting easier. The cord, though, is a necessity to achieve the power, weight, and quiet that this mower offers."
4,Nice Mower,"Pros: Light, handy, low noise, easy to assemble. Easy to adjust the height of cut. Price is reasonable. Good for people who think life: simpler the better.Cons: Two little pieces of hole cover is a puzzle. You have no idea how & why it is designed that way. The handle can't be rotated for storage. It gets stuck when mow on a yard with some kernels of liquid amber (sweet gum) trees. You have to stop the mow, tilt it and manually remove the kernels."
3,Oh God,"Tried this product the other day for the first time. Had long spring thick tendril grass extensions. Went for 15 feet, it gave up, gray smoke coming from it. I wonder if the cord I used was incorrect. I used the cord previously for my weed whacker. I'm about ready to scream as my grass is now a foot tall. Senior lady alone with not many resources."
1,Very Poor,This product only worked for about 15 minutes and died. I could not turn the lawnmower back on and have tested the exttension cord I was using. The extension cord is good. I have called Black and Decker and they instructed to to a repair shop which is an hour from my house. I called them and they gave me a hard time because I bought this item through Amazon and I decided I did not want to deal with a company and drive an hour each way that was giving me a hard time on the phone.I contacted Black and Decker again and requested a new lawnmower. I told them I was afraid that this was a lemon and I did not want to deal with the repair shop because of their attitude. I thought the product should have preformed better. My problem has been escalated and I was supposed to receive a call back from managment yesterday and I am still waiting for that call. I have a bad feeling about this.
3,"Good mower, does not get the area edges","I have a small garden, part of which is grass. This mower works pretty well, except for the edges (for which it is too bulky). I need to find an alternate solution to get the edges of the grassy area trimmed. Assembly was fast, about 15 minutes or so. I would recommend it if you have a medium to large grass area. For small areas like mine, you may need to find a tool that is more flexible."
5,EXCELLENT,This mower is a dream come true for small lawns. If you've ever vaccuumed then you can work this mower. Very very easy to use and does a great job. Five stars.
5,best b & d,"I owned one of their electric mowers years ago, loved it. My wife loved it. It finally died. I bought a second hand self propelled, heavy, awkward. And it meant I had to store gas, which does not keep well for long periods. My new mower is lightweight, easy to manuever, all plastic body (no rust), And all 4 wheels adjust at one lever to raise and lower deck height."
4,Black & Decker Electric Mower,"Good mower, easy to usee, 4 stars for not having electric cable included with the item, otherwise good product. Reccomend."
5,hubby was sick of gas-powered mowers,"He asked me to find an electric mower, I did a bunch of research, and this is what I chose.He loves it. He used it all last summer and has begun again this year. He says it's so much easier to *just* mow the lawn instead of futzing with the mower all the time."
4,My First electric Mower,I'm so glad to have this as my First Electric Mower. It's not that powerful but it ease's my mowing a lot better compared to my old one that i had that's push-power-mower.
5,Pretty cool,"Wow, just plug it in and off you go! It's so nice not having to mess with gasoline for a lawn mower. This is easy to use and does its job."
4,Lightweight & easy 2 use,"This mower is lightweight and easy to use. If you are a young lady that cuts her own grass (like me), it works. Plus I can actually carry it up and down the stairs, since I store it in the basement. My other mower was too heavy to get up the steps and it stopped working after a year.The only down side is that it is a bit flimsy. I wouldn't get too rough with it guys!Follow up---This mower died at the end of 2009. The motor gave out, plus when I had guys cut my grass with it, they ALWAYS cut the extension cord... 3 different men..."
4,Good so far,"Hey, so I have a crazy small backyard and needed something besides a weed-wacker to take care of it.Assembly wasn't too bad although I have not perfected the insertion of the ""shroud covers"" and because I'm a girl, left them out of the equation.So far, this mower has served its purpose, very lightweight and does a great job."
4,Great,"Really good, solid lawnmower, that I've had for a while now.I've recently recommended it to a friend, so thought I drop a quick review on here to, to let others know this is a worthwhile lawnmower to get."
3,Error on My Part,"I am sorry but the review I wrote here was intended to be for a different but very similar product from Black and Decker, the 9-Amp MM275. I have placed the review where it belongs."
4,Does the job.,"The mower has enough power and is light enough to be manageable.Using a cord is a pain, but I knew that before I bought it.This is excellent for the small yard or the difficult accessareas. The lever for on/off is ridiculously flimsy....why dothey top off a nice mower with a thin, loose fitting leverlike that? Go figure. Recommend this mower."
2,Not enough power,"Its a nice idea, electric power.I got this and the extra side bag to suck up the trimmings.Problem is the side bag gets knocked off all the time.Also, this thing has no power.I have to lift it up, let it get speed, and drop it on the grass when its thick.Even then it sometimes stops.Sharpening the blades helps, but it needs about double the power.It might work on think fescue or somethign, but the burmuda stops it cold."
5,Moby...it does a Debbie Harry good!,"No, this is not ""that"" song--neither the showtune NOR the Nina Hagen track. This is a total Moby original. And he takes Debbie Harry back to the sounds that she does best. This is a brilliant retro new wave/electro/house track. The two best versions are the original mix and the HOT Armand Van Helden mix, which sounds like a hybrid of new order drumrolls from ""Blue Monday"" combined with the pulsing synthline from Blondie's ""War Child."""
1,EXTREMELY HAZARDOUS PRODUCT.....STAY AWAY,I bought this device to keep the engine oil warm on my 1929 Model A during the freezing winters. Walked into my garage today and smelled an electrical fire smell. I found the device melted in a small pile under my car. Fortunately the circuit breaker tripped and saved my car and the garage from total destruction. This device is not safe. STAY AWAY fom it.
4,It does what it says,It works but on my big block Ford every part of the oil pan is close quarters with regard to exhaust so after it ran a while the plastic tie I had used to help position it and keep it on in case of snow getin up in there ( I live near Buffalo) burned off from the heat! I thought the tranny was burning up when I saw the smoke and was happy to find that it was only the plastic strap and the magnet held the heater to the pan just fine. Would have been 5 stars if the cord was a foot longer. Buy IT !
4,Good but....,"Product does exactly what it says it does but keep in mind that you have to slide under your vehicle to put this on and off unless you mount it permanently to the oil pan. I'm still mad cause i chose standardshipping and tried to cancel this order two hours later but couldn't. Good product, kept my oil temp good and warm during those cold Colorado nights and makes start up a snap when your not to lazy to slide under your car"
5,Great Heater,This has a strong magnet that attaches secure. It heats fast too. It's great for attaching to engine oil pans.
4,Decent block heater,"This heater worked pretty well on my dump truck's engine. I could definitely notice a difference between a cold start and when I used this heater. My truck's engine takes about 2-1/2 gallons of oil (medium duty truck, oil capacity for size reference) and this heater worked as stated down to the teen's Fahrenheit. I don't think it would be stand-alone for an engine the size of mine for sub-zero temps, though."
3,melted plastic cover,"I found that the plastic cover, started to melt, away from the metal hot plate first time i used the kats magnum handi heat.I live in Australia, so i am not sure, if the voltage is higher here, than in the USA.After several uses,the plastic cover has melted, away from the metal and i cannot use it."
3,300 watt heater,I used this for the first time today and quickly found out that three hours to warm an oil pan is not enough. I will increase the hours needed until I find the right length of time for a proper warm up. I found it very easy to install and remove and would have liked to had better instructions as to how many hours would be needed to warm oil at certain temperatures. I have high hopes that the product will suit my needs.
3,So far so good!,"This item showed up at my door looking like it had been sloppily assembled right outside my home before delivery; sticker/label skewed, bubbled and torn; and the handle had to be tightened because it was loose. I am rating this product a three for a few reasons: 1) it has only been used half a dozen times so far 2) it is not exactly a state of the art, highly technological piece of equipment 3) it has performed well so far 4) and it does operate at the correct heating range; give or take a few degreesOn another note; if I where rating this item based on appearence, shipping speed, and performance when tasked under inclement weather (when it gets below 20 degrees or less and 10mph winds or greater)this item would get about a single, solitary star......because they won't let me rate it lower.In the fairness business though, my opinion is; if you are not going to work this unit continuously, day in and day out, it is probably a safe expenditure."
4,Glad to have it,"This guy totally makes my car run more smoothly on startup. I have it set with a lamp-timer (you need a grounded one) to come on a couple of hours before I head off to work. The car runs and starts noticeably easier on cold days. I use it in Minneapolis, MN, my car is garaged in a separate building from my house. If it had a longer handle I could easily place and remove it as required, as it is I have it zip-tied into place."
4,300w Kats block heater,"Kats 300 watt magnetic block heater works like a charm. I stuck it to the bottom of the oil pan, plugged it in and left it overnight. Came back the next day, and the oil in the engine was warm. Works well."
2,Heater gets so hot it melts,I bought this to keep the engine block on my boat engine from freezing during a cold spell. When I went to move the boat the entire plastic backing had melted away from the magnets and heating element.
1,Block Heater nice Idea but does not heat target,"Does not work as advertised. Get a ""Frost/Freeze Plug insert type. That works. Barely heats oil pan. When 30*F temp, cannot tell the thing is on. It gets hot but very poor conduction to target."
3,Lucy/Desi Movie Pack,"The movies are sort of corny and just not as funny as the I Love Lucy Show. I was a little disapointed, but fun to see them in color."
5,Lucy and Desi Collection,"I really enjoyed all 3 movies. Specially the Long, Long Trailer. It's great to see them work together in a movie. Great buy!!!"
4,The Lucy & Desi Collection,"It's amazing to see our favorite original funny couple in color. The picture is clear and well shot, not to mention the fact that we get the same witty banter between the stars that we fell in love with in I Love Lucy."
5,The Lucy & Desi Collection,"Well for thoses of us out there who love Lucy and Desi, this is a must to own. I have seen these movies over and over again to my hearts content. I can see The Long Long Trailer and still laugh as if seeing it for the first time. A must to own for any Lucy and Desi fan!"
3,Great Collection but flaw in one of the DVDs,"I bought this set for my mother for Christmas as she is a huge fan of Lucille Ball. She absolutely loves it but one of the DVDs, Too Many Girls, is screwed up. The voices are not matched up with the lip movements. It's fine I guess if you're just listening to it but a pain if you're trying to watch it. So if you're buying the set for that DVD, just watch out, I don't know if my copy was the only one with flaws."
4,fun set of classics,"this was fun. Each has a cartoon (not always PC) and a little extra trivia or something. Not a lot extra or anything, but if you love Lucy, you'll probably love this set, which stars Lucy and Ricky in all three! -Even the rare movie where they first met!"
4,B I G 4ever,"I'm a west coast fan but i decided to get dis cd and i was pleased by it,itz got good beats,phat lyrics. My fav trackz r juicy,big poppa,unbelievable,gimme the loot, and everyday struggle."
5,classic,most great album i was 11 when this came out and..... it just blew my mind r.i.p biggie smalls man
3,Ready to get three stars!!!,"Ok the title of my review was pretty lame but o well live with it!! Anyways I didn't recently get this album I have had it since....awhile! And it's a good cd.But this cd lacks. I just think that is P. Diddy or Puff Daddy just made bad production. None the less Biggie is on top on all his rhymes on this cd.Is this cd worth getting? Sure, why not? It makes a nice collection to the cd's in your car of course don't play it in there.......because it doesn't do good with sub woofs. That is just me though! heheAnyways this album was Biggie's first and cd's are like Baseball cards. If you like Cd's just collect them. This is Biggie's Rookie album maybe it will be worth something some day. It makes a nice collector's item and it's a pretty good cd. Get it! Peace!"
3,OK BUT 2PAC WAS BETTER,"2Pac was better but this was OK.2Pac would kill Biggie if the 2 were alive right now! Compared to 2Pac,Biggie sucked."
2,Can U Say Overrated,"I'm sorry but I had to give this man 2 stars. Let Me just say that this man will never be 2pac and therefore there is no comparison. You fools on the east coast just jock him cuz he was the closest thing to pac at that time. I think Jay-z is harder than big. Anyway, ready to die was an ok album but go cop some of pac's [...]. Every joint is a banger. You listen to this album they aren't bangers. Track 12 he talks about him and his bi*tch. What is that? Oh yea some creative master at work. 2pac broght the hood [...] into and the concious rap. It was always hard listening to that man's song. I just think that BIG was coo but he is way overrated. Even though you is from the east coast you can still admit that pac is better cuz its the truth pimpin. Ive said my piece west side till I die. Pac forever L Fam"
3,Good rap cd,"Biggie drops a solid first cd worth picking up. Subject matter is nothing ground breaking and his flow is average (no Big is no lyrical god), but combined the cd is worth a listen or two."
3,This album is hyped waaaaaaay too much,"This album is good but it wasn't all that. The songs that are banging on this double cd is ""Ten Crack Commandments,"" ""Kick in the Door,""I got a Sorty to Tell,"" and a few others. But there are some songs that are just plian sickening. For example, ""Miss U"" is way too pretty. ""Another"" featuring Lil Kim is pathetic. And ""Nasty Boy..."" can you say ugghhhh! What was BIG thinking. I'll give this album its props but this is not as dope an album as everyone makes it out to be."
3,It's okay,i dink dat u hav 2 much uneccessary info and make it more interesting please Bigup to the Motley Crew and Channel View
1,P.I.G.'s albums: 'Ready to Eat' and Life After Supper',"This album is horrible, full of all of Puff Daddy's blatant rip offs and 'samples' and Biggie's twisted and unfunny attempts at humor. None of the music is good, Biggie's voice is annoying, when I listen to him I can almost hear his arteries contract, and I actually can hear the fat on his extra chins swinging against his adam's apple, to give him his 'unique' sound."
5,A Classic,"I don't understand how anyone can give this album less than 5 stars. It is clearly a classic. I bought it over 4 years ago and still bump it every once and awhile. This album is by far the best hip-hop album of 1994. Biggie demonstrated unbelievable lyrical skills and Puff hooked him up with tight beats. My only criticism is ""Respect,"" it should have been left out. However, the CD has numerous outstanding tracks. Too bad Biggie is gone, because this album indicates endless potential which was not manifested in ""Life after Death."" I should not have to tell you to buy classics, because you should already have them. And this is a classic which might even make my top 50 hall of fame albums."
5,I Was Not Ready For You To Die!!!,"I just want to pay homage to the BEST rapper of all time!! Everytime I listen to this CD it takes me back to Summer '95! Summer '95 carries a lot of fond memories and ""Ready To Die"" was a part of that experience. The Late Great Biggie Smalls can never be duplicated. He will forever be the greatest. I love you Biggie. Rest in peace baby!"
5,Still rocked quite frequently,"Is this old school yet?If you don't know every line to Juicy, I don't want to know ya:)"
3,not what was described,"I thought that this was a different CD nonetheless it is still good, but just not what I was originally hoping to get"
5,I'm not a big rap fan but I enjoyed this cd...,"While some of the lyrics left a bit to be desired (Me & My Bitch and the oral sex track), I did enjoy most of the beats."
5,THE GREATEST RAPPER EVER,"THIS CD IS THE SH!T.IF U DONT HAVE IT U NEED TO GO GET IT.THE PHATEST TRACKS R WARNING,GIMME THE LOOT,READY TO DIE,AND UNBELIEVABLE.BIGGIE IS THE GREATEST OF ALL TIME R.I.P."
5,UNBELIEVABLE,"Now this album is official, every song on this album is crazy it's a must have, when premier threw him that beat, that was it it was unbelievable right there. Invest your money wisely and go buy this album..."
4,"""Ready To Die"", reborn.","If a rapper is lucky, or any musician for that matter, they leave the world with one classic album. This is that album from ""The Notorious B.I.G."". It's less bloated and commercial than ""Life After Death"" was, and is just track after track of top shelf rap. The hits on here are just slightly better than the rest, those are ""One More Chance"", ""Big Poppa"", and the infamous ""Juicy"". I also like ""Machine Gun Funk"" and ""Unbelievable"". The bonus here is a couple more sweet tracks, and a DVD of the videos and extras. Well worth buying again if you're a fanatic. I'd say until he has a proper collection out, this is definitely the best of ""B.I.G.""."
3,This Isn't It!,"This album was a good one & it did Biggie justice- but he could never do it like Tupac. In my mind- Biggie talks to much about money & women. But Tupac- he talks about the Thug Life. Tupac goes someplace deep in his heart & soul & just shows what a genius he really was. Look at 2Pacalypse Now, the man wasn't even a man yet- but he delievered an album about his life- an album about REAL thug life. It must've been one exciting & sad life the way he tells it. Sorry- but Biggie will always be 2nd to Tupac, Tupac is the greatest rapper of all time- it's a fact."
3,2pac was better,"It's good but 2Pac was much better even though this still gets played occasionaly by me but to me theres a few rappers better than Biggie like Eazy E,2Pac and Ice Cube!I like Biggie,not like like just like him because he is not bad but out of the 3 main dead rappers,the list goes in best1st 2Pac2nd Eazy E3rd Biggieand personally Nas is a better lyricist than Biggie and my verdict on this is good effort but 2Pac was better!"
3,"GOOD, BUT ITS NOT THE BEST CD EVER",EVERYONE THAT SAYS THAT ITS THE BEST CD EVER ARE FROM THE EASTCOAST. THIS CD HAS SOME GOOD SONGS AND THE REST WERE JUST A WASTE. FOR ME THE BEST CD IS ALL EYEZ ON ME. AND THE BEST RAPPER IS 2PAC.
5,This the best hip hop album ever made its completly classic,This is hip hop in its purest form biggie is the greatset mc to ever walk the face of the earth.He's the muhammed ali of rap the jordan of hip hop the G-O-D of the whole buisness so buy this joint if you dont have it and listen to hip hop in its purest form the greatset of all time R-I-P B.I.G THE UNDISPUTED KING OF NEW YORK
1,don`t even waste your time with this cd!,"Biggie, is probaly the 10 worst ever. Don`t even spend your time even looking at this cd. 2 Pac is like 10 times better then this sob."
1,biggie good 2pac better,This CD is good but people dont realize that biggie was not the greatest rapper of all time.2Pac was.People need 2 realize that 2Pac was better.Get All Eyez On Me and listen 2 the differencebeetween 2Pac's Voice and Biggies voice.2Pac was much better in his voice.2Pac was also better lyricaly.Watch the MTV2special22 Greatest MC's and they even say that 2pAC IS BETTER
1,Garbage,"Biggie sucks,he only made 2 albums.He's A Straight Up Loser,a Fat Slob with cock eyes.Just Like Pac said,he was nothing until he started Rappin.Get All Eyes on Me"
1,What is the big deal?? Can a brotha get a clue??,"This guy was called B.I.G. and he should have been named BIG, FAT and UGLY!! Who would really find this enjoyable to listen to? Most all rap music is just the same beat, same rude lyrics, sung by black guys rubbing their crotches. Now that is really attractive, fellas!!Do yourself a favor, instead of buying this CD, go get yourself some real music, some R & B or maybe Motown. THAT is R.E.A.L., but this rap crap is a B.I.G. waste of money."
5,biggie at his best,"One of the best rap albums of all time (in my humble opinion). Tupac def. deserves respect for thought-provoking lyrics, but Biggie will always be number one in my book because he has charisma in his raps and I think that counts for alot in the public eye.If you like these, I would check out the new Duets album that provide more Biggie covers.. but naturally there is nothing like the real thing!"
1,Terrible Version,"Something went horribly wrong here. As others have mentioned, several tracks have been altered. Additionally, the packaging does not match the description. This set does not have a gatefold cover. Sides 1 and 2 bizarrely have the same track listing. Is this a knockoff?"
1,WORST ALBUM AND RAPPER OF ALL TIME!!!!!!!!!!!,"STOP OVERRATING THIS CD BECAUSE IT IS NOT ALL OF THAT! THE BEST RAPPER OF ALL TIME IS TUPAC. IF YOU WANT TO HEAR REAL MUSIC, CHECK OUT TUPAC'S CDS."
5,When will we get another artist with this kind of talent?????,"When this album (well, my 1st copy was on cassette) dropped it changed my world.... I literally ""let my tape rock 'til my tape popped"".... Rediscovering this album, made me painfully aware of the drop-off in popular music in this country. I turned my 18 year old little brother on Biggie & now the kids at college are bumpin' some REAL hip hop at the house parties..."
4,Must have,"When I bought the album and I was listening to it and it got to track #7 ""ONE MORE CHANCE"" I was a little bit ... because I remember that song being slower tempo maybe im confusing for a remix but i've heard it on the radio and they played a different version and I really like that version more it even had different lyrics I just became a rap fan 3yrs ago . As for the cd must for every rap fan biggie is one of the illest, favorite tracks Warning and Juicy this CD should be in everybodies cd collection if u don't have it your not true rap fan the lyrics proved biggies leadership of the EAST and the life he had to live in the struggle."
3,Great album,"Great album, Juicy is probably my favourite song on the album. I had to drop 1 or 2 stars because of Puff Daddy talking all over the records. I didn't notice it the first time I listened to it, but when I noticed Puff Daddy's annoying voice and echo effect, it just ruined the album for me."
2,Pac 4 ever,"this was an iight cd, but im still a pac fan 4 ever, you can buy it if u want but i recommend pacs cd PEACE!!!"
5,Amazing cd!!,"Great lyrics, great songs, maybe not as much of a classic as some other great East Coast rap albums like Eric B & Rakim's ""Paid In Full"" or Nas' ""Illmatic"". But who doesn't like Biggie? His lyricism, wit, style, makes him one of the greatest rappers of all time. This is a must have cd for a true hip hop fans cd collection"
5,Biggie is truly larger than life,"Biggie Smalls a.k.a. Christopher Wallace left a special mark in the hip-hop community and all other rappers look up to him for incepration and love. That's what makes Biggie a true idol to kids of all ages. His lyrics truly describe the heart of the #1 Big Poppa and they truly describe him and his struggles back in the day. Now to the album, Biggie drove this hard to the core and put his heart into it. The best song im my opinion is ""Big Poppa."" Every song on this album is great but this shows where Big really shines to the fullest. Enjoy! Biggie 4 ever!"
5,Ready to Die,"The greatest rap cd of all time. Any rap fan will love this mix of old school rhymes, exceptional lyrical content, great beats, and hooks. I rate this album a 5+"
5,A book that inspires!,"Mike Svob's book is one that I can't put down. It's full of hands-on, practical advice, written in an honest and often humourous manner. It's a great book for an impatient artist like myself who wants superb painting advice without boring theory. The overall design of the book is very appealing. Highly recommended!"
3,The colors are too much,"This was an example of not being able to look into the book prior to purchase. I would not have bought the book. Reds and Oranges just make me nervous and most of his paintings are filled with them. The paintings are dramatic, however most of them disturb me with their colors and I cannot paint that way. I suppose some of the advice is good that's why there are three stars. He is definitely a very talented artist but not for me."
1,Cute but unsuitable for chewing,"These are cute huts, but are made of sawdust and honey, neither of which is healthy for your guinea pig to chew on, and guinea pigs do chew on everything.Guinea pigs are better off with cloth hidey huts or even with a large cardboard box.It's a pity the company is marketing this with a misleading name which suggests there might be something nutritious about their hut."
3,"Good Item, Not for Rabbits","Although the quality of the shak is decent, it does not fit rabbits. I have two rabbits and neither of them could fit inside and both initially refused to touch it. However, after one of them tore apart the roof, making it roomy enough to fit in, the rabbits began to eat it. So buyer beware if you are looking to buy this for your bunnies."
2,possible injury for guinea piggies,"I bought this for my guineas not really for a snack but for a hideout because it was cute. They didn't try to eat it for two months. Then one guinea realizes she could eat the roof. They started pulling the straw out of the roof and eating it but the straw isn't soft like timothy hay, it is really stiff. They leave pieces of roof hanging low from the roof while they are pulling it out. So when the piggies walked around the enclosure these spikes were sticking out at eye level. I read where a piggie died from an eye infection after getting poked so at first I kept pulling out the pieces that were hanging and they ate it off the floor but after a day or two I decided it wasn't worth the trouble and got a plastic igloo. Maybe I was just worrying too much but I didn't think the sharp straw sticking out was safe."
2,cute but short lived,I love the way this looks and my guinea pigs love it. Unfortunately they especially love the hay roof. We have had it for a week and the roof is almost unusable. I do not recommend this.
2,Boring......,"If you like ""LifeTime"" or ""Hallmark"" movies, this is the book for you, unfortunately, not for me. The character's were flat, the storyline predictable with every cliche imaginable. It was so dull, I finished it 3 days ago and have already forgotten about.Save your money and get this one from the library."
5,THE BUTTERFLY HOUSE SOARS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Always a fan of Ms. Preston's work, I eagerly anticipated the release of this book. Very different from her previous efforts, this book gets more unique with each page. I found myself engrossed in this book from day one, and I couldn't sleep until I read the last page. This book is wonderful and should be considered Ms. Preston's best work to date. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who loves to read."
4,Archel,"A deeply moving story in which we are let in to the depths of a young girl's battle to grow up a whole person amidst a world full of struggling and broken people. Discovering the truth behind the dreams she holds dear will take you back to your own discovery of mortality, reality, and the truth behind the surfaces around us. This beautifully written story is unflinching in its presentation of the world, and is deeply real in its vision."
3,Readable,"An interesting and quick read that certainly had a hold on me--I read it compulsively. Compulsively in the way that I sometimes watch reality TV, knowing it has very little value, but hooked on the outrageous stories. This novel spun a melodramatic, improbable plot to compensate for so-so prose that never grabbed my attention. Again, it's fun to read, but not exactly high art."
5,Wonderful drama,"This book takes you places completely unexpected. I highly recommend this book, what a wonderful story."
5,Like watching a movie,"As a writer, I can't help but read critically, but I found The Butterfly House close to perfect. Marcia Preston turned out a novel that is fresh and gripping, so true to life that you'll feel you've lived it. It's a must-read for women of all ages."
3,The Butterfly House,"Bobbie Lee's past was full of heartache that culminated in tragedy and a stint in an mental ward. That is behind her now, and she is making a decent life, until someone thought long dead calls in a favor forcing her to meet the truth head on to save the best friend she ever had, even if it means losing another one.*** The intricate story's necessary flashbacks interwoven with the present both enhance the complexity and hinder the smooth flow of the rather meandering story. Though well crafted, the constant mingling of past and present makes for less than ideal reading. ***Reviewed by Amanda Killgore."
2,Beautiful Guys But Boring,I fast-forwarded the movie to scan after the first 15 minutes to look for anything interesting. You'll only be left guessing what's inside the bags of those beautiful boys.
4,Slightly Scarlet: more than slighty good,"This is a fine John Payne movie. It is not a high budget spectacular, but just a finely written little movie. Given the time it was made, it was more than ""slightly scarlet."" It will seem tame by today's standards, but it is still worth a watch. It is nicely plotted and acted but somewhat soap opera-ish. Go on and try it!"
2,For Hardcore Davies Fans Only,"The prospect of Davies penning ghost stories delighted me, so I purchased High Spirits for my annual October spooky reading. These stories are fun, but there's no getting around the fact that I was hugely disappointed. They are comic, not scary or even groteque. They were written to entertain his colleagues and students, and they are kind of dull for the general public...especially as the premise is basically the set-up for all 18 stories. Nevertheless, even without enjoying the tales themselves, Davies never fails to be an engaging writer, and his first person narration is often clever and amusing in his own unique style. Worth the read, but for Davies fan's only."
1,"Doesn't work with Windows Vista, or Windows 7","Only works with Windows XP, and older operating systems. Won't work with Windows Vista, or Windows 7. You can't install a driver, to make this product work, with Vista, or Windows 7. I'll have to give this product away."
1,REALLY TIGHT & HARD TO OPEN,"I was trying to replace the Sunair Aluminum Corp sliding window lock that broke. Ordered the product shown on the picture (left slide open), but what came on the mail was the wrong item, opposite lock (right slide open). I tried installing anyway for fun to experience it.The material is made of a much thicker metal than that of Sunair, really tight when pushing down to lock, and it is really hard to open pulling up... This product may be good for you if your not using a Sunair Slide Window Lock, hence if you are, then order thePrime Line Products F2590 Window Sash Lockwhich is a close fit.Close examination of the product of C.R. Laurence, the picture on this belongs toC.R. LAURENCE F2590 CRL White Sliding Window Lock With 2-1/4"" Screw Holes and 3/8"" Latch Projection(left slide open), but the website order for F2592 (right side open). They should really update the photo to match the product they are selling, avoid future confusion.__"
2,Not what I expected,"Black & Decker Lawn Hog 19-Inch Electric Mulching Mower with Rear Bag #MM875Veery disappointed! I am a seniror citizen, and my review may reflect my age, but Ill go back to my old gas, self-propelled mower tomorrow!I found it difficult to push, difficult to manuever the cord, it kept dying if I cut more than a 8"" wide path of grass, grass spewed out from catcher (yes, it was firmly seated), was NOT quiet...as loud as my old gas except for the initial start-up. The only thing I liked about it was the easy start."
2,black and decker mm875,"THE UNIT IS UNDERPOWERED. THE DESIGN IS VERY POOR, DOES NOT NOT HAVE ENOUGH SUCTION TO PULL ALL THE GRASS INSIDE THE BAG.unit unit was delivered with screws missing."
2,Does the job,"Good for small yards with short and thin grass, it gets weak when the grass gets tall or thick and wants to die."
4,Works well - would be better with push assist.,This mower works great with small lawns that have minimal obstructions between the electric outlet and the desired mowing area. The only way they could make this mower better is if it was push assisted.
2,lasted 1.5 seasons,"The mower was pretty good for 1.5 seasons. It did not cut as cleanly as gas mower - the mowed grass looked ragged and there were quite a few missed clumps. The mower did not seem to generate the suction to lift and cut flattened grass. The motor burned out last week. To be fair our grass is abnormally tall and thick this year. I could hear the motor laboring, smelled the electical smoke-smell, then it just died. I had hoped it was just a circuit breaker, but nooo, none of those on this puppy... Never again. I bought a gas mower."
4,"Good product, but require replacement of parts every year",Mover is great. Have used it move then 2 years already.One minus that it's require to replace plastic fan every year.But prices for parts are cheap.Follow the link to see details of mover and order parts:http://www.dewaltservicenet.com/Products/DocumentView.aspx?productid=8647&typeId;=6111&documentId;=5004I spent a lot of time to find that web site.
3,"18"" Blade, but only 6"" cuts","While I thought that getting used to the cord would be the main problem with this machine, I have been surprised to find a worse problem. The design of the blade is incredibly stupid. The whole central 12"" inches of the blade are raised up and so never even hit the grass, leaving only the outer 6"" to do all the work. This makes for very inefficient mowing. I have to do everything twice to make it look decent, which makes the job twice as long. With a small yard, may be okay. For a large yard, it is quite a disappointment. Otherwise I have not had a problem with it in 2 years. I did spray nonstick pan coating on it when I first got it as recommended in another review and have gotten very little build up underneath. I can't believe so many people gave this mower 5 stars."
5,Best Mower I've Ever HAd,After years of owning gas lawn mowers I finally decided to try an electric model. What a difference. It's as light as a feather compared to a gas mower. It cuts extremely well and is easy to adjust and maneuver. The smooth body is also easy to clean. With gas prices soaring it also makes sense to go electric.
4,Excellent mower but the wires get in the way too much,"Really good product that does what it advertises but it is a lot more effort even for a small rectangular lawn.It took me nearly a year to get efficient with it and I still spend a lot of time moving the wire to make sure the mower doesn't go over it.Pros:Really powerful and cuts tall grass easily.The cutting area is reasonably big.Cons:The wire gets in the way a lot even though my lawn does not have many obstacles or curves.I observe my neighbors working on their lawn and I take at least nearly twice as long for the same size lawn mainly because of the wires.If I had to buy another lawnmower, I would probably go with a battery powered one or a gas mower. That is not a knock on this mower, it is more on the wired motors in general."
3,so-so for an electric,"I've used electric's since i was 12 (now I'm 42). This model is better than some but they still don't have all the kinks worked out. Likes: always ready, never out of gas, cheap to use, no noticeable increase in electric bill, cord never gets yanked out which is huge ... the best update to electric's of all that I've tried.Dislikes: shallow deck means it clogs somewhat easily in think or wet grass, bag doesn't hold alot and needs shaking down to fill completely, no side discharge if you want to go bagless, mulching gets clumpy if you don't mow religously, be very careful with your grips since they tear easily when you lay sideways to clean under the deck"
2,I'm on the fence on this one,"It works, I mean it cuts your grass. If your grass is low, and there aren't many trees in your yard, and your yard is small, and you want to save a few bucks on a mower. But then again you're dragging an extension cord around your yard and it really struggles on tall grass. I bought a nice john deere mower and I couldn't give my electric one away. I should mention that the snap cap holding the left rear wheel fell of and I had to go to Home Depot to find one that would work."
2,Another gutless electric,"I expected this electric to outperform the gutless electric I bought about 20 years ago, since it was the highest rated electric in Consumer Reports, and hoping electric lawnmower technology had improved over the years. It was gutless as ever and I had to go over the same ground three times to cut down the tallish dandlelion stems. Should have bought gas, period."
1,Failed after ten weeks,"The motor commutator completely destructed after about ten usages on a small lawn. This type of failure just should not occur. We have had problems with Black and Decker irons failing prematurely. I think that Black and Decker is not what it used to be in terms of quality. I plan to junk it, take the loss, and buy another brand."
5,Trusty tool provides independence and reliability,"I have now used my lawn mower all summer and Love it! . It cuts as good if not better than my Toro gas powered lawn mower..(which I am trying to sell)Goodbye smelly gas fumes; goodbye noise; no need to wait for the men to come home to start the lawn mower for me .. Great excercise.. just walk along in the sunshine and fresh air... you can even hear the birds singing while you get your lawn mowed..how eco friendly is that !If I need to adjust the height, just one little lever on the side makes the adjustment..and it is so easy to change..Parts of my lawn I like to leave a little longer, other parts a little shorter.. no problem..It is so quiet that as I mowed near my perennial gardens, the butterflies and bees never moved .. not so with the gas powered mower..I have recommended this mower to all of my friends.. and plan to get a second one for our summer cottage.."
4,Great Mower,"I have recenlty purchased my first home, which has a small yard. I was advised to purchase an electric lawnmower. I went to Sears and saw the perfect mower. I checked the internet and found the identical mower at Amazon. The mower was much less expensive so it was purchased. The mower does a great job with the small yard I have. The cut is clean and I particularly like the mulching aspect of the mower. There is little to no clean up in the yard. The bag is easy to empty and the yard looks great."
3,"Quiet, easy, but lacks power.","I've had this mower for a couple years now and it is easy to just grab a cord and mow the lawn real quick. Problem is if the lawn goes for too long, the mower has a hard time getting through the taller grass. It helps to weedwack first when this happens. As long as there's regular mowing, it does a good job on it's own.Unfortunately, the mulching is subpar and leaves clumps of grass more often than not. The bag attachment does an ok job of trapping the clippings but it usually needs to be emptied a couple times before the job is done.I really like the fact that it's quieter than gas mowers and doesn't belch out any fumes. And the fact that I only need a cord to start mowing makes it really convenient.I don't think I'd trade it for a gas mower but I do hope that Black & Decker make improvements to their electric mowers so they are more competitive with gas mowers."
4,Great for California Sized Track Home,"This is the top rated electric lawnmower by Consumer Reports. It is strong, quiet and light weight. There is also a very simple height adjuster. Three of my neighbors have the same unit. For smaller yards this is all you need. Just make sure you don't run over the cord. Finally, save money and buy it on AMAZON. Amazon easily beat the department stores and it qualifies for free shipping."
2,"Some good, some not so good","First, the good.1. Doesn't need gas2. Doesn't need oil3. I liked the wheel adjustment.Now the not so good:The deck or blade housing is designed primarily to provide cooling for the motor. There's a small fan on the bottom of the shaft that helps with the airflow but it detracts from the efficiency of grass collecting.As a result, grass collection suffers.The deck design is close to the ground in front and it pushes the grass down; the result being an uneven cutting.The mesh in the collection bag is course enough to let small clippings and dust flow through. If you wait until the grass is dry enough to cut, you will usually get a lot of dust. If you try to cut grass while it's still damp, the mower doesn't have quite enough power.The current draw on the motor, 12 amps, requires a large wire size extension cord, preferably a minimum of 14 gauge but the method of securing the cord to the mower requires a small cord.More poor engineering."
4,black & decker lawn mower,very good lawnmower very easy to use and to setup cutting ranges are on agood setting needs very little setting mulches grass great.
4,Easy mowing....,"This was the first time I ever mowed a lawn and was looking for an easy to use, electric (going green) lawn mower. Because my lawn's size wasn't much, I decided to go for a corded one (and also to avoid the hassle of replacement batteries). This mower was ready to use as soon as I opened the box and it has done its job very well. I have bagged all clippings and have not yet used the mulching feature. It is relatively silent, given my neighbors' mower sounds, but find it slightly heavy (I do not have a benchmark for this because I do not know how heavy others are. It is for this reason that I have marked one star down from the rating). Overall, I am glad I made this choice and would recommend it to anyone in a similar condition."
4,PRETTY MUCH WHAT I EXPECTED,"I read your other reviews for this product and agree with most of them (except about the cord falling out - maybe it wasn't looped into the securing device). Like they said, it arrived in a big box, fully assembled except for tightening a couple of knobs and putting the grass bag on its frame. I've only used it twice and only with the mulcher. It worked well on long grass and MUCH better than my old push mower! The cord is a bit of a problem - I had to figure a route around a tree - but I will take that over the negatives of a gas-powered mower: mechanical, noise, fumes, mess. (I didn't buy a cordless because I was concerned with loss of power and how long a charge lasts.) Also, it is fairly light-weight and maneuverable.In summary, I got what I expected and am basically satisfied with my purchase so far."
4,A little short on power,This is the second mower of this model I have owned. In new heavy grass you will have to mow a half row at a time and then overmow again to get an even cut and the grass small enough. Be sure and avoid the natural tendancy of rolling it over a steep bank to get the weeds as a rock strike deflected the blade into the bottom plastic of the mower and it was destroyed--chopped up. I didn't want to pay the price for a battery power mower so got this one again and am being more careful.
2,Poor Quality Mower - Doesn't Bag Well,"I bought this mower a couple of years ago and have given up on it. It has trouble with grass over a few inches high. Most importantly, it doesn't bag properly and one constantly finds oneself stopping the mower to unclog the attachment."
4,Good for a small lawn,"This mower is very easy to assemble from the box. The mower deck height adjustment is great. Power for cutting thick grass is adequate, but if using the mulching feature don't let the grass get too high. For my small lawn of about fifteen hundred square feet this mower is perfect."
3,Not comparable to a gas mower,"Overall, if you have a small yard and don't mind keeping track of the cord while you mow (which it really didn't bother me that much), I would recommend this product. The simple lack of maintenance is a big selling point. The construction is relatively sound and it is easy to use. However, I was genuinely disappointed in the quality of the cut. There was very little suction power which I believe is to blame for most of the uneven cut. I understand that my back yard is a challenge for any mower (very bumpy, several large old trees that bombard the yard with twigs and leaves), but this mower simply couldn't handle it. I also had to walk slower than with a gas mower in the areas with thicker grass, even though it wasn't particularly long.If I ever move to a house with a more conducive yard for this mower, I will probably give it another try, but this machine really wasn't in the same league as a quality gas mower."
3,Some good...some bad,"The thing is quiet, fairly powerful, light weight, and the height adjustment is great. The rear bag is poorly designed. There is no handle or easy way to grip it for removal. It also has a very open weave, and when you start the mower dust blows through it toward the operator. The blade rapidly loses efficiency toward the edge of its' cutting path so that no matter how careful you are to overlap your cutting path there are always a few spots where it looks like you missed overlapping and you need to go back and re-mow it, the end result of this is as if it had a much narrower cutting path. Even though it is a mulching mower it picks up less of twigs, debris, etc, than a gas mower so there is a little more clean up of your yard needed. Overall, I like it, but it has some drawbacks as noted."
5,Great mower!,"In my childhood (20 years ago) I remembered using electric mowers that were anemic at best so I was hesitant to try one again. I read somewhere that driving a brand new Saab 9000 from LA to NY produces less smog than running a gas mower for one hour so I definitely didn't want to buy a gas one. Well, I figured I have a small lawn so why not try it. Now that I have it all I can say is it works great. Alot less noise, no awful gas fumes and it mows great. Save your hearing and the environment and get one!!!"
1,Bad Design,The mower as a mulching mower is fine. I found no problems with cutting the grass but it gets zero stars with the bagger. The mower has a small hole that shoots the grass into the BOTTOM of the bag. The bag can not get more than 1/3 full and the small chute plugs with the slightest of wet grass.I don't understand how this passed the factory engineering department. I looked at all the electric mowers at Home Depot and they were all the same. I went to Sears and found a mower.
2,"Good for a while, then broke","My husband and I both really liked this mower in the beginning. It's lightweight, easy enough for me to use and fairly quiet compared to gas mowers. I also liked the fact we didn't have to keep gas around since we have a small child. However, we have only had the mower for 3 years and the motor just died yesterday. Really not worth the money. I would spend more to get a better quality mower. Now we have to buy a whole new one because the warranty is past."
5,Great mower easy setup,"Have had other elec mowers in past yrs and know the aggrevation of a cord but for small or medium size yards and those of us who cannot muscle up a gas mower to start or spend money on a battery/key version.. this is really a super mower. It arrived in a timely manner, easy for this old lady to unpack and setup. I don't use the bag it came with, just the mulcher. Very easy to start and shut off and the price and discount on delivery allowed me to get the cover for it basically free. Love amazon and this mower !"
4,Very nice machine,"This is a good lawnmower. I have had it about a year and would buy it again. It has enough power to cut almost any lawn and is well made. I really like the easy height adjustment lever. The deck is plastic and the way it's molded gives it strength but also limits how close you can get to things. 19"" means more trips on a large lawn but is good for tight spaces. The cord is a pain but it balances out when you don't have to buy gas, change oil, clean filters, replace spark plugs, smell fumes or yank the rope."
5,Easiest Ever,I couldn't be happier with the ease and convience of this lawn mower. As I am a single lady getting up in years I do not have the strength for a gas lawn mower. This one is so easy to use. It is very light weight yet does a very good job. The mulching is very clean. I probably will never use the bag because of the quality of the mulching. The only problem I have had is I bought the extension cord at the same time as the lawn mower so it is new also. When I have it plugged into the mower it seems the vibration(ever so slight) makes the cord become loosened so I have towatch for it falling loose. That said though this product is well worth the money.
4,Not bad yet,"This is the first electric mower I've used and I think it is pretty nice. I've only had it for a few weeks, but I'm happy I don't have to worry about gas or oil or pulling that damn chord. all I gotta do is plug it in and go.I Don't like mowing my lawn and by the time I get motivated to mow it I just want to go and do it, not drive to the gas station, fill my little jug up, and come back to mow. That adds like 30 minutes onto my time, and my lawn is pretty small, so it takes me only 20 min to do each yard.some people bitch about tugging the chord along, but really I don't understand why this is such a big deal. you start close to the plug and work your way out. If you had a big lawn then I could see the chord being an issue. But I'm a poor college kid, and this is alot easier to use, then what I remember my old gas mower using."
3,Pretty Good,"The handle is a little low, only coming up to my lower waist. You are unable to adjust the handle height. it starts great, sounds quiet, and mulches just fine. Perfect for my smaller yard."
4,Great Bang for the Buck,"I have used a Black and Decker electric in the past, but this one has improved features, notably larger rear wheels which make pushing easier with pretty good maneuverability. The handle is ergonomic, and generally I find the mowing job less stressful. Handles grass well, though missess some of the really tough weeds. Guess that's what weed-wackers are for anyway. I found the price very reasonable for the powerful job this machine does."
5,Love the electric!,"This is a great mower. It does a great job and is ergonomically very comfortable to use. This is my first electric mower and I love it. Also, it shipped really fast."
3,An OK Small Yard Mower but Needs Some Design Changes,I have a small urban yard and this mower works just like I expect. As a mower it isn't anything special but I can't find any faults either. But I certainly would not recommend it if you had any close to 1/3 acre.However there are a lot of design improvements that could be made. Since I only have a garage the mower is a nuance to store. The handle should be hinged at the body and have a second hinge part way so the handle can be folded and the mower stored.Having the handle designed as it is with the battery charger permanently attached to the handle makes the mower very difficult to transport. The handle has to be removed but the power cord limits the handles movement so that you have to juggle the mower which is awkwardly weighted and the handle at the same time.All in all it mowes a small yard but it isn't designed for keeping in a garage.
1,Black @ Decker 19in. Lawnhog,Mower Work fine for 3 years. Now it continues to stall out. Have sharpened and balanced the blade several times. Have cleaned the grass out of the bottom.Still does not work. Called B@D to get help. They told me to take the mower to a service shop in the Bay Area.(I live in Nevada). I asked to talk to someone in the service dept. The request was refused. I believe there is a problem with the engine but I am not going to travel several hundrfed miles to get it fixed. I will toss the mower and find another company to deal with.
2,Electric cordless Lawnmowers are a nuisance,"This product performs as per the manufacturers specs. This is my first lawn mower and am unhappy with the product. I feel it takes too much effort to manage the electric wire while mowing. Definitely, the cordless brother of this unit (nearly $150 more) or a gas powered, elect start even, is a better choice. Used it for less than a month and already looking to swap this."
2,Burining smell,"I burchased the mower based on the reviews I saw on this and other websites recommending the product. But I was disappointed on first use. 30 seconds into using it, the motor started smelling like it was burning. I returned it the second day thinking the first one was a lemon. I tested a second one in the store, which also made the same smell. It amases me that this is not coming out in these reviewes. I wonder where at Black and Deckers these reviews are written."
3,$130 replacement battery,"I have owned this mower over three years. I have a small yard;and have been overall satisfied with its performance. The plasticconstruction has not been an issue for my light use. Finallyafter 3 years the battery will not recharge. This is to be expected, allrechargeable batteries wear out eventually. Unfortunately the replacementbattery is $130. I now have a choice of buying the battery or paying a littlebit more for a new mower.It seems like a total waste of a good mower; but I think I will purchase anotherbrand with cheaper replacement battery."
2,I don't know why,"Frankly, I don't know why so many people like this mower and give it such high ratings. I bought it largely based on the rave reviews, and regret it for the last two years, not to mention the claims made by my wife that this is the worst research i did on buying a product - having a cord attached to a mower is simply a bad bad idea."
2,Handle breaks,I will make this short. The mower itself does a fine job for my small yard. I have purchased two of these over the past 4 years. In both instances the handle (that part that you pull to engage the motor) broke after two years (just when the warranty went out). The first time I just disposed of the mower (not knowing where/how to repair). This month (August) the same thing happened to my current model (the warranty expired this past May). I did find an authorized dealer to repair it. It has been with them for 3 weeks (had to order the part). Their receipt stated that the repair would not exceed $89.00. Not sure what the actuall amount will end up being. It just seems strange that the same thing happend to both mowers. The quality of the handle apparatus needs to be addressed. I do like the idea of eletric. If I could find another manufacturer that offered one I would be more inclined to try another brand.
2,Decent Mower For Light Duty,"I bought this mower for use on what I would consider as the ""largest yard you would want to tackle with an electric mower"" my lot is (140 ft x 100 ft).The Good- Virtually maintenance free (aside from keeping the deck clean)- Quiet- Does a good job if you are tackling a light mowing choreThe Bad- Broke after 1 year of use (luckily still under warranty now I'm going back to a gas mower)- Not as powerful as I'd hoped (I knew it wouldn't be as strong as a gas machine but it still seemed weak)- Blade dulls abnormally fastOther than the blade and durability issue I liked the mower. I suppose if you have a small lot and can use a short thick cord, and don't intend to use it for medium-heavy mowing jobs, this mower may work for you. Otherwise buy a stronger gas powered mower."
3,An instruction booklet would have been nice,"Received the lawnmower in a very large box. There was no instruction booklet, no warranty nor registration card---no I.D. of any kind---just a lawnmower Luckily, I was able to read the instruction manual on the Internet, otherwise I would have had to return the Lawnmower to Amazon for want of knowing how to use it! I hope this was merely an oversight at the factory, and not some sort of terrible low standard in customer service. Machine runs and cuts well. Clipping bag is made of cheap material (planned obsolescence?) and the undercarriage of the lawnmower can't be thoroughly cleaned as grass sticks to themolded plastic like super-glue!"
1,Commutator plate came off,"I had the same problem as another review, a contact plate came off of the commutator on my 2 year old mower. Either buy a new armature $118 or get a gas mower. Going to get a gas mower."
4,Quiet and Clean,"NO more smelly fumes. No more blue oily smoke. No more yanking and tugging the starter cord, barely missing a flooded engine condition. No more tune ups, spark plugs, hauling the gas engine mower to the shop. The birds in the trees hardly move now when I turn on the electric mower and zip through mowing the lawn. I'm liking it!"
4,B&D MM875,"This was a replacement for a similar lawn mower purchased several years ago. Since the original mower served me well, I decided to get a similar one. I was not diappointed. My lawn is fairly small, and this is the most appropriate instrument for a 74 year old to mow his own grass."
4,No more raking,I had purchased an electric Black & Decker mulcher 18 years ago without the bag.Bought this mower with the bag for the fall season so I don't have to rake leaves and I use the clippings for mulch. Heavier to push than the old model but it's better than raking.
4,lawnmower purchase,"As I expected, this lawn mower does what it is supposed to do right out of the box with no assembly required. It was delivered in a timely manner as promised and operates perfectly."
1,Piece of @#$%*!,"We bought this mower 3 years ago. After the 1st season of use it needed major repairs, thankfully covered by warranty. It made it through a 2nd season, but conked out at the beginning of this summer. Left with little desire to fix a crappy piece of machinery, we instead bought a 19"" YardMachines electric mower. The YardMachines mower is a WAY BETTER PRODUCT. The body is metal, the wheels are big which makes mowing easier, it has a clever cord keeper, and we are very happy with our new purchase. Don't even consider the B&D - Check out YardMachines."
3,some issues...,"My old Craftsman rechargeable just went through its second battery (at about $200 each) and I decided to give a corded model a chance. My new house has a hill and the lighter corded model is much easier to push around. However, the height adjustment mechanism broke the second time I used it. The lever to the front wheels was not secured to the pin that connected it to the back wheels and it just slipped off easily from the jarring that ordinary use provided. Luckily, there is a repair center in my city but still...it shouldn't have failed like this. One other issue is that the new machine does not bag nearly as much grass on the same yard as my old machine."
3,Not as good as my old Craftsman electric,"I previously had a Craftsman corded electric for about 25 years. It worked great, had good vacuum action, and was well built.This B&D; MM875 seems flimsy, especially the on-off lever. Mowing always leaves strips of uncut grass even though I overlap each strip. This requires re-mowing the same areas. The grass also looks lumpy when I'm done. If it had better vacuum action, I believe the results would be more acceptable.The cable holder is a good idea but requires crimping the cable too much to get it into the opening. It would seem that the cable won't last long because of that.I don't believe it's possible to get 25 years out of this mower like I did the previous Craftsman."
4,Impressed with the Power on Bermuda Grass!,"I have had much trouble here in Gilbert, AZ trying find a landscaper that will not bring other peoples weeds with them. I decided to conduct my own lawn maintenance and also to purchase the B&D Lawnhog electric mower. To my surprise it is as equal a cut as any of my past landscapers have given me and the power to cut through the bermuda grass. The cord issue is no problem because when it's in the way I simply roll the cord out of the way and continue to cut. Cutting away from the electrical outlet is by far the easiest and quickest way to go. Very happy in Golbert, AZ!!"
4,Does a pretty good job.,"The mower arrived in just a few days, and it was ready to go right out of the box. I just had to unfold the handle and adjust it to a position that I liked. It is easier to move than the old metal Craftsman electric mower it replaced, but it doesn't seem to do as neat a cut in places where my grass is thin. There is also a slight smell at times from the mower like something was overheating, but it has continued to work fine through about five uses now. It does a good job bagging the cuttings, too."
1,I hope you like power cords.,"I made a mistake buying this mower. Your power cord will become your best friend when using it. To make matters worse - the motor is VERY weak, and stalls in grass four inches or higher.With the shipping being very expensive - you'll be stuck with it if you buy this. The concept of an electric mower is a neat idea. But make sure you really want it, before ordering."
3,You get what you pay for.,"I would never purchase another electric lawn mower. It is a great hassle having to deal with a cord and being careful not to run over it with the lawn mower. Even though the instruction manual shows you how to mow your lawn without hitting the cord, it still gets in the way. I purchased an electric lawn mower because the price was modest but now looking back, I'd pay the extra money for a battery powered or gas powered mower. This mower preforms well enough to do the job but wasn't amazingly impressive. One big disappointment was that the rear bag really didn't catch anything. If you have a really small area to mow, I'd recommend this machine. If its a larger area, go with something else."
2,Very difficult to use with a cord,"products works good and cuts well.I dared to buy this inspite of friendly advices about possible difficulty using a corded one. soon after using couple of times i realized it is big pain managing the cord and cutting the grass. very hard to push also. I don't recommend this type of corded, non- self-propelled model to anyone.pros:No gas - no fumes no pollutionLess noiseCons:Very diffilcult to manage a cordneed to push hard to move it.You get tired very soon"
4,Decent Option,"This is not a heavy-duty mower. If you have a smaller lawn and you mow regularly, it is a dependable little option. It is relatively quiet and you can't beat not having to buy gas."
4,Worked better than I expected,"This little electric mower was able to cut through my dense, 1 foot high, slightly wet lawn with no problems. The only thing I had to do periodically was unplug the motor, and clean the wet grass off the blades."
1,"light, easy to use ,but no power","this mower is light, east to set up and use.but no power, the mulch cant go into the bag in the back. the wire become very hot after 10 min use.returned to the shipper."
4,Nice,"This is a nice machine just to mow your lawn and get rid of the grass in the bag easily afterward.Electric machine is recommended over gas so I never tried a gas one, so I cannot provide a comparison between gas and electric mower.I had this mower just over a year, just recently it wouldn't start and got it fixed under warranty from Black & Decker authorized place. Took about a week and then it's running without problem again.The price is good and it's an old brand that's why I bought it.Get it for what I wanted and I am happy with it."
1,Short Life Span,"We used it for our ~2000 sq ft yard. We store it in the garage when not in use. Used it for ~25 times, but it stopped working all the sudden. We expected a longer life span than this. The warranty is only 2 years. We are not satisfied."
3,Tried and True,"This is similar to the mower I bought 7 years ago from Sears. I hoped to have the same success with a Black and Decker. Unfortunately, I will already have to get the handle (that starts the mower) fixed. The handle/start mechanism has a faulty connection."
4,Very Satisfied,"Arrived promptly and in excellent condition. Have used it twice and no problems. Easy to push, and mulcher is easy to use."
4,Great product...some tips on cord mgmt,"Light weight and easy. The motor does have problem with thick- tall grass. Get a 12 gauge cord, not 14 or 16, this will allow the motor to draw more power. My biggest hassle has been to windup the cord. 12 gauge is thick and heavy. I got the hose pipe reeler from home depot and did a little workmanship on it to remove the existing connector for the hose pipe and fit in the cord. (Had to cut some plastics) But after that it's a breeze."
4,Electric Mower Review,"Out of the box it is easy to unpack and get to cutting the grass. Simple, no gasoline, but the cord is bit of a fuss at times. Overall I am very happy and it was rated by CONSUMER REPORTS."
4,Lawn mower review,"This mower works well but is quite heavy to move even on the highest setting on the thick type of St Augustine grass common in Florida. However, it produces a nice result and catches all the trimmings as it goes leaving a tidy result."
1,lemon,lemon and poor customer service broke after two uses and wont honor productBlack & Decker MM875 Lawn Hog 12 Amp 19-Inch Electric Mulching Mower with Rear Bag
3,review,"Works well, but it is annoying to have to keep shifting the power cord from side to side. It is nice and quiet and needs no gasoline."
5,Environmentally friendly!,"Mower has a nice wide base to mow the grass swiftly, quietly and can even be used on ""spare-the-air"" days!"
3,Okay,I got this with the idea of using it to mulch plant debris piles. It is a bit weak for that. As a mower is it okay. I have a gas riding mower for big jobs and use this easy electric for little jobs when I don't want to crank the rider. This has saved the day when something was wrong with my otherwise great John Deere riding mower. I never have used the rear bag.
1,3 year mower,I bought this mower in 2008. It is easy to use for females. I did not use it half a year last year so basically only used it for 2.5 years when the switch handle area started smoking and the key area was ruined. The warranty is 2 years and when contacting Black and Decker they refused to do anything. This mower isn't cheap and should last a lot longer than 3 years. Black and Decker doesn't stand behind their products. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS MOWER AT ALL. I just ordered a Lawn Boy!
2,"Black and Decker cordless mower - 19""","I purchased this B&D; cordless mower 2.5 years ago.Pros- powerful enough to mow even long grass- 19"" path was a good size for our small yard- switching from mulching to bagging was easily done, with the bag being a good size for clippingsCons- battery only last 2.5 years and now needs replacement- replacement battery is over $200 for either the B&D; brand battery or most popular aftermarket brandsSummary- I can't recommend this lawnmover. The high initial cost should have been outweighed by a longer life.Given the high cost of replacement batteries, the maximum life you will get out of this lawnmower is 2.5 years before having to replace it.I will be going back to a gas lawnmower as the long term costs are much less. The ""green"" B&D; mower is on it's way to occupy space in a landfill."
3,Only for short people,"Thsi mower has not got an adjustable handle and it is too low unless you are 5'4"" tall or less. Since the shortest person who uses this mower is 5'8"" tall, we are all screwed.The ad promised an adjustable handle but it is NOT adjustable.No matter how well it mows it kills your back so B&D; may be in for a disability lawsuit soon for killing 3 people's backs."
4,need to buy an extension cord,"The box does not have any extension cord, so you need to buy themin order to use it. So it is not good to go out of the box.Other than that it is an okay mower considering this is my firstmower. I wonder if that was a such big deal to throw in an extension cord by the manufacturer."
5,great mulcher,I purchased this mower in Jan/2011. This little beast handled the bagging of our yard very well when we were first getting out of the winter blues. For the last 6 mowings i have used the mulcher and it works great. This mower really shreds the cuttings easily and very fine. Our grass is bermuda and very thick. The cord is the only pain (having to drag it around). Great mower at an excellent price.
2,Motor Failure,"I purchased the MM875 because I have a small, flat lawn and I wanted the environmental benefits of electric. I used the mower 4 times with some considerable difficulty mowing without bogging down, even with the deck set very high. On the fifth use, the motor seized altogether. Service required a half hour drive and the repair cost almost as much as the mower. I would not recommend this mower. I found it to be unreliable and the warranty repair experience disappointing."
1,Not worth the money,The switch failed after three years and the motor after four. It never cut uniformly even with the bag. The grip broke apart as well.
4,Good electric Mower,This was the best rated electric mower according to consumer reports. It works well and is easy to adjust. I found the the shroud on the backside would flatten the grass and hamper cutting if I were to try and pull the mower backwards. I cut about half the shroud (its made of stiff rubber) with some heavy duty scissors and now I can pull it backwards when the situation calls for it. It is easy to adjust. I found that the bag on the back worked well but wasn't really necessary. The mower shreds/mulches pretty well and its easier to move without the bag.
2,Requires two passes to cut properly,"This is my second electric mower. I have two pros: the cutting height adjusts quickly and easily and the blade stops immediately when the handle is released. My previous electric mower (Taskforce) would slowly wind-down when the handle was released. I have one significant con: this mower doesn't cut worth a damn. I have never removed the blade and I use my Dremel to keep the blade sharp. The height is set at the mid-poiint of the adjustment range. However, it leaves about half of the Kentucky Bluegrass uncut, i.e., bent over, during forward motion even at a slow pace. I have to pull the mower back over the same strip to cut the remaining grass. Actually, I think it cuts better in reverse motion. I cannot recommend this mower. I wish I got the same mover those folks who gave this a 5 star rating got."
5,B&D Lawn Hog does the job!,"I purchased the Lawn Hog a few weeks ago to replace a 2010 gas powered mower that was almost ruined by the ethanol that is mandated in this area. I have a zero lot line dwelling so a 50' power cord covers my front and back yards with just moving the plug-in for the cord once.I have nothing but praise for the Lawn Hog. It is very light weight and easy to use. One has to be careful with the cord but I have already worked out my mowing plan to reduce the chance of running over the cord. The grass hog is powerful and easily cut the yard even though it was quite high and somewhat wet from the dew the first time I used it. It bags well if one takes off the bag, after it is less than half full, and shakes the grass into the back of the bag. This allows the bag to fill completely. The mower is very easy to clean and the yard looks very even after every mowing."
3,Needs more power for heavier grasses.,"If your lawn is as thick as fescue, expect to have to mow twice if you don't mow at least once a week. Leaves many blades of grass standing on the first try."
2,Not reliable,"I bought this mower to replace an aging gas mower that was getting hard to start and keep running. My hope was for a relatively maintenance free mower. With no gas and oil to provide, what could go wrong? Well after less than 3 years of use, the electric motor failed and needs replacement.Cord management was a hassle and slowed down the mowing process. This mower never did give a nice even cut and almost always required going over the lawn twice. If the lawn got a little tall, I had to be very careful so as not to bog down the motor and cause damage.I plan to go back to a gas mower with a little more power and repairable parts."
1,Waste money,"Plastic deck has 5 years warranty while the motor has only two years. After my motor burned out after 2.5 years, I opened the motor and found the motor has been designed to be weared out after some period. In my case, it's 2.5 years - twice per month for my small front yard.I saw fire and smoke when the motor burned out. No tech support at all. I was satisfied with the idea, but totally dissatisfied with the product quality now - I thought the product from black & deck can be trusted, but for sure, not this one."
3,pretty good value but..,"Price seems good after doing some comparisons for electrics that had good reviews. But it can't handle grass that's very long. Takes twice as long to mow. Blade seems not quite as sharp as i thought it should be. I had a B&D 18"" before this that lasted about 14 yrs. This model is 19"", but it seems quite a bit heavier for that extra inch. The rubber handle grip has already ripped (i wear gloves) on the left side. Only used the mower about 5 times."
3,Not a good lawn mower for yards with a lot of obstacles,"This a good, strong electric lawn mower. It cuts well and dicharges well. It will even discharge very wet grass (better than the gas mowers I had).Problems:1. Center of gravity is at the front of the mower, making it hard to turn.Other electric lawn mowers have the center of gravity at the rear wheels, making them much more agile.2. Padded handles do not last very long.3. The grass bag is almost even with the handles. If you mow up against a wall, especially a low wall, with a curve, you will scrape the bag, and wear it out in about one year.4. The wheels are hard plastic, covered with a soft rubber tire. If you mow along a wall, or trees, the side of the tire eventually rubs off and the tire pops off.If you are just going to mow long stretches out in the middle of nowhere, this is a great lawn mower.If you are going to do mowing that involves making tight turns, and have to mow around obstacles, it is not a great choice."
1,A cheap piece of junk !!!,"I recently purchased the Black & Decker 19 inch electric mower. On the second use I hit one of the sprinkler heads. It totally trashed the motor. Knocked it out of alignment and tore up the magnets. It is now a $250 piece of junk on the lawn mower repair guy's junk pile.This mower is very cheaply made. The shell and most parts are plastic. The motor casing is very thin sheet metel, a few steps above tin foil.Stay away from this product !!!"
1,Didn't last 20 minutes,"My wife and I recently bought a new house, and were very excited to purchase an electric mower. We figured our lawn was small so it would be better to not deal with the hassle of a gas mower. So we went to home depot and purchased the MM875. However, after using it for about 10 minutes, the engine quit and started to smoke. I of course quickly unplugged it. Suffice to say, I'll be returning to home depot today or tomorrow to return it."
1,Worked five times then died.,"This mower worked well, cord is awful, wont stay in mower well......but it only worked 5 times on a very small lawn. It died, but Amazon understood my plight and refunded my purchase price. Amazon is fantastic in regards to customer service. I purchased a fiskar reel mower and love it. nothing to break"
2,Black and Decker MM875 lawn mower,This lawn mower lacks the power to cut through bermuda grass in the summertime. It also lacks the power to transfer clippings into the rear bag. This mower is adequate for very very small lawn areas with very fine grass types.
2,"Hard to push, cumbersome, uneven cut","I grew up with a Black and Decker electric mower, so I was thrilled that this one was on sale. However, it is deceiving. Even though it's more than 45 pounds lighter than our gas mower, it's very heavy to push. Also, we were not able to get an even cut without going over the yard 2 or 3 times.The cord was a problem for two reasons: 1. We have a hammock, a swingset, and flowerbeds in our yard, so we kept having to untangle. If you have an open square or rectangle yard with nothing in it, you'll be fine. 2. There was no where to hang the cord, so you have to carry it. We even bought a lightweight 100-ft cord, but it was still heavy and cumbersome to carry.Our yard is not that big, about 100 ft X 50. Thankfully, Amazon let us return it."
3,Designed so it is difficult to find an extension cord that fits,"Works well.The bag picks up most of the grass (not as much escapes as with other similar mowers I have used.However, it does not get as close to the edge, as other similar mowers I have used.Make sure you purchase the correct gauge cord (which is not well explained in the manual, which only mentions amps).14 or lower Is needed, and do NOT get one that has some fancy light feature at the end. It is sized non-standard and will not work."
5,Works very well,"This mower was a replacement for an old B&D electric mower. It cuts very well, is fairly light in weight, and worked flawlessly, right out of the box. The rear bag attachment only takes seconds to attach, and it is easy to dump out - but pay attention when you remove the bag, or the spring loaded cover will pinch your fingers! But this is a minor problem compared with gas engine mowers that are more trouble than they are worth ..."
5,better than expected...,"After reading all the reviews I expected a less powerful mower than my old 6 hp gas mower. I was suprised by it's ability to pick up all the leaves on my lawn as well as cut my 3"" grass. You can't beat the ease of use ( especially the starting)."
3,Under-powered,"My old B&D lawnmower was dying, so I decided to purchase this one to replace it. The motor on the new one seems to be under-powered, even compared to my old B&D mower. I like the rear-bag catcher, although it's a bit awkward to put it on and take it off. Overall, not bad but if I had to do it again, I would probably get a different one with a more powerful motor, perhaps a gas engine mower."
2,Bag Blew Up,"We bought the Lawn Hog from Amazon and it FINALLY arrived today (after about 6 weeks of waiting). We took it out of the box and plugged it in to mow. It seemed fine for about 2 seconds and then- BOOM! The bag completely disintegrated at the seams. If you do not plan to bag your grass, this mower is fine. The material on the bag is too cheap and flimsy and poorly sewn. I am waiting to hear from Black & Decker to see if they will send me a replacement bag on the off chance this one had a factory defect. Wish me luck."
4,Works Great,"Arrived with one broken locking knob for the adjustable handle. Was an easy fix with epoxy.It is a good feeling to not have to keep pulling a rope to get the mower started. No more smelly gasoline to bother with. Just plug it in, squeeze the on switch and go. Very easy one hand height adjustment. All four wheels at the same time. It is light weight and does not put wheel ruts in the lawn."
4,Good but are engineers lost?,"This is a very good mower for a smaller yard.Taller folk will like the extra length handle.The motor is geared up over the smaller unit (which I had owned), so it cuts more evenly.There is one major bad design.The discharge bag is nice sized, however the opening on the mower (after you pull out the insert) is so small that it will never function.So if picking up tree droppings, leaves, or grass is a wish - look else where."
4,Does what it is supposed to do...,Takes a little bit to get used to mowing your lawn if you're used mowing with a gas mower. You just need to remember you're using a cord and you need to know where it is so you don't mow over it. Huge plus is that the mower can be raised/lowered according to the height of your lawn.
5,Great reference book!,"This book provides great summaries of diagnosises and disorders. It is not extensive, but concise on its explanations."
5,Kathy,"This is the 2nd edition of this book, there is a newer edition. I really like this book, there are questions written just like the NBCOT writes them, and it gives the reason for the answer."
5,very pleased,I'm really pleased with this purchase. It's new and for a much better price that others I had shopped. It will come in very handily for my studies.
4,As advertised,A simple device that works as advertised. Shipped quickly and in good working order. I would recommend this to anyone looking for an easy way to slice a pie.
4,Took awhile to decide...,First of trilogy. If you're looking for something different...you've found it. Interesting character dvelopement. The author sounds as interesting as his characters.
5,open the door,this song is totally awesome... it was a favorite of a close friend and me. never gets old
2,"YOU'RE PREGNANT, YOU'RE NOT CRIPPLED","This is your far too typical slasher film that offers nothing new. We see a young boy kill his mom's drug dealing boyfriend because he won't hand him the remote...and yes I have killed for the remote too, but never for cartoons. When 4 young adults show up at a junk yard, one of them is shot by horseplay. The police get involved and now a killer is loose.The dialouge is as good as most slashers with a few quips. The characters are at times fun, and other times just boring, as the film runs hot and cold and seems to drag even during some action scenes. If you want to watch a new slasher, try ""Deadtime.""F-bomb, no sex, no nudity."
1,What a waste of time...,"I kept seeing this movie Wreckage available to rent on my local RedBox but it was never in stock. So I decided to take a chance and purchase this movie from Amazon. BIG mistake! This is one of the worst movies I have seen and it was WAY overpriced on Amazon. Please pay $1 and rent this if you must, you will not have any desire to watch it again. By the way, the movie was so predictable as to who the killer was...."
3,SCOOT SAVES THE DAY,"A bespeckled Scoot McNairy is the saving grace of WRECKAGE. He plays a goofy redneck manager of the rundown junkyard where the film occurs and manages to steal every scene he's in.Otherwise, WRECKAGE is a fairly routine and predictable slasher flick. Opening with a fifteen year flashback, the movie jumps to present day where we meet 4 young people facing a maniacal killer in a run-down car junkyard. BREAKING BAD's Aaron Paul and Mike Erwin head an adequate cast which also includes 70s character actors Roger Perry and Joyce Bulifant in supporting roles.This rated version is sparse on gore and nudity attempting to chill audiences with its eerie setting.While WRECKAGE isn't a great slasher entry, McNairy makes it fun."
1,Wreckage Rated Version,"I saw this movie for cheap and it sounded good. Yea, doesn't all horror movie reviews start that way? Anyways, the story, acting, and timing is good. There is no blood or gore in the r-rated version, matter of fact it's could be pg-13. I didn't know there was an unrated version when I bought it and that is something I can't stand is unrated films. There is a site where you can check the difference between films but this one didn't have this movie up yet. I don't know how gory it could have been. So yea, it's a basic pg-13 horror film with a good cast but very little blood and no gore. The film doesn't really make sense in some scenes but I guess i'll have to wait for the website to get ahold of the copy to see if I missed anything. The movie gets funny towards the end when they find the owner's nephew, Frank. Other then a few dumb laughs, stay away from this movie or at least get the unrated version. Also, the guy on the cover doesn't even appear in the r rated version."
2,Doubts on History,"Reaching for the Oversoul is a very interesting book, thoughtfully researched and with some interesting theories. However, the one thing that bothered me is that in verifying a regression, the author states that 'before the long reign of Queeen Victoria, there was a King Edward'. Well, the King Edward that existed long before Victoria was Henry Tudor's son as far as I remember and this wasn't the era described in the regression. King Edward VII was the son of Victoria and reigned after that Queen died. This lack of accuracy spoiled the book for me and I just wished I could speak to the author."
2,The Alfi Is Iffy,"It's a beautiful design and color but that's as far as it goes in the world of coffee carafes. The handle on top is very thin and requires some strength in turning the top (I've had to go so far as to utilizing a screwdriver or knife as a lever!). It keeps the coffee moderately warm but not hot, but that may be a by-product of my fear of really screwing the top on too tightly. If looks are what you are after, this is the one for you. If you require your coffee to be kept with some modicum of heat retention, look elsewhere!"
3,Beautiful product; a tad impractical,"This is a great product for setting coffee on the table when you have guests over. It's attractive and retains heat well. However, you can't put it in the dishwasher, which makes it impractical for every day use in our house. Other than that, it's a good value."
2,Plastic screw cap breaks,I have owned this carafe for less than a year. The screw cap is assembled from two pieces held together by two thin plastic projections. Both broke off and I had to unscrew the cap using a wrench. I am throwing this out.
2,Looks 10 Functionality 2,I love the way this looks but after owning it for three years with just occasional use it has warped so badly that I can't screw the top on AT ALL. I'm disappointed and wouldn't recommend buying this.
4,She Rocks,"This is an awesome DVD. The music sounds incredible. Siouxsie and Budgie are amazing to begin with, so when you add the backup singers and the orchestra, the result is a dream. It really blew me away how good it is. Of course Siouxsie sings a hair under pitch at times, but that's why we love her. She looks great and still prowls the stage as she always did. It's about time these artists were able to produce a show that enhances their amazing talents. If you're on the fence, buy it!"
5,A really good ending,"This film, featuring Kharis's fourth appearance, is more exciting that most of them, because the really good parts come sooner, but at the slowly building beginning, people can squirm and shiver as they see the spooky bayou and the characters talk about the mummy.Now, when the action is real close to happening, Ananka appears, and the scene is represented beautifully. Also, the sun was coming out of a camera lens, but it still looked real.Then, as the story ends, it settles down, and we see Kharis's fate. But, like in most movies, the scene is more exciting then it sounds, so, if you like the classic 1940-50's horror shows, this is one to watch."
3,Not exactly the best... but still pretty eerie!,"Kharis(Chaney) and the newly incarnated Ananka, last seen sinking into a New England swamp, are found in a Louisiana Bayou. Kharis searches for his long lost love and she keeps running from him. Of course, Kharis's strangleing habit kicks in from time to time, but after a while it gets annoying. A very, very surprising conclusion may leave you dissapointed or confused. Still, if you've seen the previous films, go ahead and see this one. The last of the series."
1,"COME ON, PRINCESS ANANKA COMES TO LIFE!","This is the worst sequel to ""Mummy"" ever. the acting is bad, and when Princess Ananka comes to life, it ruins the entire plot. Do not waste your money on this trash."
1,Very poor scholarship,"The ancient Indians may have eaten beef, but the manner of analysis and the evidence provided by Jha amounts to very shoddy scholarship."
5,The best of Clarence Page comes out in this book,"Educational and a great insight of the black and white relationship in America. Read this book and you'll learn something, no matter who you are."
1,"Read ""The Race Card"" for balance!","""The Race Card"" is a collection of essays originally published in Heterodoxy magazine and edited by Peter Collier and David Horowitz. The chapter based on this book (""Clarence Page's Race Problem, and Mine"" by Horowitz) is an excellent dissection of Page's book and a must-read to put proper perspective on the recent race hysteria."
4,Best Source foe CV-8,"Whether you are a historian, student of WWII or a modeler this is the best source I have found on the USS Hornet (CV8 )that launched Jimmy Dolittle's immortal raid on the Japanese home islands in April 1942, The biggest morale booster America could want only 4 months after the Pearl Harbor disaster. To top it off the Hornet was a major combatant at the Battle of Midway."
4,The Captain has Landed...,Another outing from Captain Dave and Crew..Seems to be another good cut of the Hawklords.....Glad to add it to my collection. . .
5,Indespensable,"16 years in the graphic arts, as both a service bureau techie and now as an IS support techie...this book rocks! I use it for my personal reference, and I recommend it to all of our designers and admin QuarkXPress users. Don't underestimate how easy it is to reference stuff and how well laid out the book is. A must have for designers as well as support techies."
4,Pretty good,I enjoyed this little romance. Jill Landis is a good writer. A good beach-read for the summer.How I Met My Spouse
1,No success stories of Siegfried Lemke in Italy 1944,"The author had only one sentence about JG-2 figher ace Siegfried Lemke being successful in Italy 1944 when I/JG-2 was assigned to that theater of operations. The author never gave any stories of Lemke's scoring 16 aerial victories before his unit was returned to France. The author is suppose to be an expert on the Luftwafee; however, in this book and several other books, he has fail miserably in detailing the aces and their victories. He just seems to concentrate on the big picture of the Germans losing the war. I am surprise that the Osprey company keep publishng his books."
2,Good but....,"This is a good book, but written in very dry reading ( typical of this series ). Of course the purpose of the book is to give a very general description of JG2. But it would have been much better if Weal could write a book in the same style as Don Caldwell's ""JG 26 TOP GUNS OF THE LUFTWAFFE""..."
1,Black Settlers of of Rural Wisconsin,"He wrote this book and has Macajah Revels as being of black descent. He was Cherokee and English, His Mom was a full blood Cherokee and father was a English man. Some of Macajah's children married people of black descent. This is from a great, great grandson of Macajah's. His father told more stories too many to put in here."
1,What a whinner,"OK, yes, this book did have its moments and the author's ""passion"" seems to be there - in kind of a self-important sort of way. However, the ""people"" is very limited - I wanted to know about who, what, when, where, and why biodiesel is being made and used. That was largely lacking unless you want to know about the author and his little band of followers. And the ""politics"" is just a bunch on whinning. The author's seems to have a ""big companies making biodiesel are the enemy and the only true religion is small, make it in your back yard, or you'll go to hell"" perspective on biodiesel. However, if you really want to see biodiesel used in any quatity the big companies are the path to making it happen. No, I do not work for a big biodiesel company and yes, I make it myself - for personal satisfaction. Probably half 1/3 of this book is taken right from his web log so why spend your hard earned money?Overall this book was very disapointing."
4,Non anamorphic,"Although this DVD of the movie is touted as widescreen, it is not anamorphic. The omission of anamorphic in the description of the format is accurate, not an oversight. So you do not get the quality improvement you might expect from a widescreen film when viewed on a widescreen television. Instead, to get the proportion right, you have to tell your DVD player that the TV is 4:3, then expand the TV picture to fill the screen."
5,Well Worth Your Time,Robert Kausen has written a thought-provoking book that could help any business person get greater leverage in the workplace. I am a business consultant and lead Leadership Seminars for business executives and their companies. It is refreshing to come across a book that addresses head on the critical link between a person's state of mind and their effectiveness at work. This book is very user-friendly. The first part of the book helps you to feel confident that you have ready access to healthy states of mind and what you need to realize in order to live more consistently in these states. The second part of the book does an excellent job of conveying how you can bring this understanding into practical application. Mr. Kausen presents information that will not only be helpful in the workplace but will also help many people to improve their relationships at home. I am recommending this book to all the business people who attend my trainings.
4,A fun read but a bit short even at 158 pages.,"If you've seen the movie ""Idiocracy"" you probably have a good idea of what ""The Marching Morons"" is about. They're similar in premise but the actual plots vary wildly allowing for both to provide interesting takes on the concept of an America (or world) taken over by the ""morons"".For folks planning to borrow it as part of the Lending Library I would just warn you the novella is a bit shorter than 158 pages. It's likely that the printed version, from which the 158 page length is drawn, had a larger print and as a result the book feels about 1/2 that length. You may enjoy the book but you might also find yourself annoyed at giving up a free read for something so quick."
5,marmot windshirt,"This jacket has a minimalist design which is perfect for layering. I used a combination of this marmot windshirt, long sleeve shirt, and an under armour base layer during a recent snowshoeing trip; I was able to stay warm/hot throughout the entire trip. There is one pocket and it is located on the chest; it is just big enough to carry some chap stick or in my case an inhaler. I would recommend this product to be used in similar situations and layering configurations."
2,QSR textbook,"I bought this text to use in a quick service restaurant class for culinary students. Although the articles are well researched, they are rather dated. The editor should update this collection of articles to newer research. The foodservice industry evolves so quickly, that anything older than two to three years quickly becomes old news and passe. The collection of old articles from almost a decade ago also does not justify the high price of this book. My students found little value in this book, other than to see whether the research or trend predictions that were written panned out a decade later."
2,"Quick Service Restaurants, Franchising, and Multi-Unit Chain",Loaded with case studies and statistics.Little or no practical applications.
5,"Insightful, Eloquent, Enlightening!","A splendid book on the Yiddish language - a rich lexicon with very easy to follow pronunciation. Each and every word is illustrated with a joke or an anecdote that gives one a unique insight in Jewish life. The Preface of the book contains lots of interesting information, and must not be missed! It is a real pity that this book is now out of print."
3,missing important items,The origianal Joys of Yiddish is better. This new edition leaves out some important terms and stories. So I was disappointed.
5,Hilarious,Great source to look up everything your parents blurted out at you as a child. Most definitions are followed by anecdotes employing the Yiddish word. Oy....you should check it out.
5,"7"" Godzilla 2005 Gigan Action Figure",I bought this action figure for my grandson and he has had tons of fun with it. He collects these figures and has added this to his collecion. I will buy him more as they come available.
5,Santa will be the hero of the year!,"Got this for my 5 year old as a Christmas gift. He's an avid Godzilla fan and is absolutely obsessed with the Godzilla franchise. I can't wait to see his face when he sees what ''Santa'' brought him this year. My only complaint is that it's a tad pricey. Generally, most of these figures can found in your local K-Mart for about $9.99 each; however, this Gigan figure is a Japanese import (although I thought most all of them were anyway, so I'm not sure why they're more pricey than any other toy from Japan) and it's quite a bit more colorful than the mass produced K-Mart guys with far, far more detail than you'll found in his ""cheaper"" counterparts."
4,Tree Frogs Bucket Seat Cover,"Seems like a Quality product for a resonable price, installation was easy and the fit was good."
3,Quite expensive but cute.,"Cute product, a bit expensive but I love frogs. My only complaint would be that one of mine ripped at the seam within 15 days of being in my car. That stinks. I'm still using it but not too happy about it. Fast shipping though."
5,Love them,"These seat covers were a bargain, the quality is reasonable and they were easy to fit. Makes the seat much easier to clean with the covers on."
5,Perfect,"Everything was exactly as expected, product was in the condition that was stated, did not take long to arrive and I would definitely buy from this user again."
2,Such a disapointing ending!!!!,"I read the first book and finally managed to get the sequel. I was so sorry I did! It started out great, and had me throughout the book, but the ending ruined both books for me!! I can understand why the author ended the book the way she did, but it was such an anti-climatic and sudden ending that it leaves you with hoping for more. Even another page, something! If I had known the ending would be so poor, I never would have invested in the book. I already gave it away on paperbackswap.com"
1,Waste of my money,The first book was so great and the ending left my wanting more but the second book's ending was so idiotic there better be a sequel. It makes the first book seem pointless...what a waste
5,Powerful Torah and Art,Rabbi Ebner is a powerful speaker and thinker whose full talents are seen in this striking and moving book. We can hope that this 'innovation' (religious poetry) - once common literature of the greats in Jewish History - will find a wide audience and many imitators.
5,A Moving and Important Book,I just finished reading Rabbi Ebner's collection of poetry. I was moved to tears by more than one poem in the collection. If the Jewish community takes Rav Ebner's message to heart and incorporates poetry and the poetic sensability into religious life it will be a significant step indeed. I have been fortunate to be a student of Rav Ebner's. I am hopeful that this book will allow an ever larger circle of people to gain from his wisdom.
3,Doni album,"Dino has sounded much better on other albums,and the songs were not the one's I thought they would be but for Dino fans they may enjoy it better than I did"
5,Fantastic Noir Cinema,"This is just a plain terrific crime noir film. It's loaded with atmosphere, gritty dialogue, and an interesting story. Dennis O'Keefe (an actor who I'm ashamed to say I'd never heard of before this) is great as an undercover Treasury agent doing his best to ferret out a gang of counterfeiters.Dark and moody with genuine suspense and plenty of guts. It's even got an introduction by one of the real life Treasury agents that took down Al Capone. Worth seeing if you're a noir fan. Or crime buff. Or just interested in watching an old film that has aged remarkably well.Oh, just see it, you mugs."
2,Beware of rocks with this mower!,"Just started cutting my lawn for the 5th time with this mower and managed to kill it tonight. All it took was hitting one rock hidden in the grass for a sec, and -boom- it's dead. Just smoke coming out of the motor. I can't recall ever killing a gas mower this way in my 30 years of cutting grass and I know I hit a few similar or bigger rocks in the past. I'm now really torn about fixing it versus going back to gas.It's too bad 'cause up til now it was easy to use (my 10 year was cutting the grass with it [under my supervision]) and did a decent job of mulching except with heavier or wet grass.Haven't found out what the cost to repair it might be but I suspect it will run close to 50% or more of the $189 cost."
1,Lawn Mower,"This mower was assembled incorrectly. I orderd it online because I can't fit a lawnmower in my sportscar. In order to return it I would have had to ship it back; an ordeal. So with a hammer, great determination and a few good wacks I was able to get the piece in it's correct place. I'm not sure I would order another lawnmower online."
5,Never a gas mower again!,Quiet. Quick. Clean. No gas. No oil. No spark plugs. No pull start cord. No exhaust. No problems. No brainer.
5,Satisfied Customer,"This is the first time I've used an electric mower; and, I'm very happy with it. The only feature it could have that would make it better would be if it were self-propelled.Another comment is that I ordered the mower from Amazon.com on Monday (late afternoon) and it was delivered on Thursday (early afternoon). I got the best price in town on the mower and excellent delivery time."
2,"Poor Manufacturing Quality, Service, & Clumsy Use","I purchased this lawn mower a few weeks ago. I found an electric lawnmower to be a novel idea, but working with a power cord has proven to be clumsy and restricting. In less than a month, the hooks/pins attaching the handle to the base broke, making the lawnmower inoperable. I was not overly rough with the mower. Customer service suggested I take it to my ""local"" service center, which is over an hour away, and only open 7 - 5 weekdays. Not wanting to make 2 trips (200+ miles of driving and 2 half-days off work), I called first, and they didn't have the parts in stock anyway. The replacement parts are being shipped to me, and I'll get to fix it myself."
4,"great value, quiet, low maintenance...","I opted to go electric rather than gas eventhough a number of people recommeded otherwise. biggest complaint from people is that the cable that you have to drag around.. IT's NO BIG DEAL. You'll develop a system the second time you use one.Pros:1. Electric,2. No gas, oil to worry about,3. Mulches (with an option to discharge),4. Shhhh... quiet (at least not as noisy as Gas),5. and the one that did it for me is the flip handle (move handle from one end of the mower to the other). This will help you manage the extension cord. (the MM575 sells for $10 less and comes without the flip handle).Cons:I'll keep you posted!"
4,electric mowers RULE for small lawns!,"Hey running this mower takes me back to my teenage years when I used to cut my grandmother's lawn with her electric mower. I always thought running her mower was darned easy and I think running this CU recommended B&D mower is darned easy too. And it is quiet! I spent more than 10 years before my divorce running a rider lawnmower on nearly an acre of lawn with earplugs firmly inserted. No need for earplugs with this little jewel. It might be a tad underpowered in comparison to gas types. But all you have to do is raise the deck until the poor thing isn't struggling anymore, and that is really your feedback about how deeply to cut! And it sure beats the Sears gas mower I found in my rental house that spit gasoline out the muffler on the first trial pull. I have never seen a small engine do *that* and I have messed with quite a few during my half-century :-)Bottom line: no muss, no fuss. Beat that with *any* gas mower."
4,So Far So Good,"I am very happy with my electric mower thus far. I needed something I could put in my car (Firebird) and mow a medium sized area in front of my office and some areas at my home. The light weight mower was easy to lift and the handle comes off to make it compact enough to put in the back seat and hatch area of my car. The electric wire, for my jobs does not get in the way. In fact, it presents no problem once you get used to it.The power of the mower is not as much as I would love. When the grass is high (over 8 inches) the mower starts to bog down. But if one simply does not challenge the power by mowing less grass per pass, or by raising the mower as you push to trim back some grass for the second pass, it does the job well and mulches the grass.I have had the mower a short time and have only used it three times thus far, but I don't forsee any problems."
5,Great Mower,It's a wonderful product. Not polluting was my main reason for this purchase and I feel great about it. The flip handle on this particular model was why I chose it over the others and it has worked out just as I supposed. I'm mowing on a hill and the flip handle makes it so much easier and safer.
3,Great when it is working,So I bought this mower in the spring after not having had a mower for about 10 years. It had some nice features like the flip over handle and it was a mulching mower and thanks to Amazon---a GREAT price. It worked right out of the box and I was a happy mower until yesterday when I went to mow there was no power. I checked everything it could be but no luck. Will contact Black and Decker today and see what they do since it is obviously still under warranty...
2,breaks down again!,"I have the previous version, the MM600, it is four years old and broke for the second time today. My lot is 130'x50' on which sits the house, a driveway, a large deck, a shed, and a vegetable garden, the rest is grass for the MM600 to mow. The first time it broke I had only used it 4 times. Warrantee covered the problem (which was never really explained) but the mower was gone for over six weeks. The mower ran fine through last year's drought, our mowing season runs May to October. In its forth mowing of its forth season it quit as I was rounding into the back yard and blew the circuit breaker in the house. I hope many improvements have been made to the MM675 since the MM600. I wouldn't buy it. Last time I took it to service there were 3 other identical mowers in the small shop. Good luck."
5,Great Mower,"I have used electric mowers since I was old enough to operate a power mower. My dad had a mower with a big electric motor but much lower rpms. The B&D Lawnhog is my second electric. It replaced a Sunbeam Twin blade model. Definately get the flip handle! It keeps the cord to the trailing side (so you don't cut it). This mower cleanly mulches my lawn until it reaches a height of 6 inches. Only then does it leave debris. This model also has a side discharge chute (and an optional bagger, which I don't own). I use a maximum of 100 feet of extension cord to power the mower."
2,Don't waste your money!,"I used this mower for one season and the start of a second season, maybe 20-30 times total, on a small city lot. For no good reason, the mower started smoking. I browsed online and saw that these mowers have started on fire. I tried to contact Black & Decker customer service but got no response. I checked online and found that a new motor would cost nearly as much as a whole new mower (not counting installation of the motor). Even though I've only used it for a little over a year, I actually purchased it over two years ago, so it is not covered under warranty. Now it's a piece of junk, and I have to shop for a new mower. You can bet it won't be a Black and Decker!"
5,I love this Black & Decker mulching mower!!!,"I don't have a lawn--and don't want one! I use this mower to mulch the leaves (oak, maple, gum) that fall in my back yard. It performs even better than I had hoped. The flip handle is great. I could not be happier with this product. Your reviews really helped me make the decision to buy and I am so glad I did. The price was right and the delivery was even sooner than expected."
4,Lawn Mower Man,"Sometimes I cut the lawn in the summertime with lawn mower.Lawn grows very quikly and some flowers are very die hard. You need a really good lawn mower to survive all your home garden enemies. Black and Decker's lawn mower is one good choice to cut your lawns. Lawn mower is efficient, fast and easy to use! Only bad thing is lack of lawn basket. Your trousers will be very green so don't use your best trousers. All in all, This good choice for you lawn mower man or woman!"
2,Enjoy It Before It Falls Apart,"This MM 675 is a great mower when it is in one piece. You need to watch as you mow for parts falling off (screws, etc) or one day the whole under carriage will fall off. For me it lasted one season, which I consider expensive for a $200-250 electric mower. The first one I got (new) had a broken handle, and I had to get another before I received credit on this one as my grass was growing quickly !! The flip handle works nicely until it begins to slip. Finally this week the engine began to smoke and stopped dead as I was mowing slowly on a medium high lawn, so they can not accuse me of stalling the mower on thick high grass. I hope I get so sort of refund or replacement, but looking at other reviews I am hesitant, and am looking for a different brand, but which one ?"
4,Flipped,"Overall very good. However, the debis guard on one end broke in the first five minutes of use. Its main brace was made out of a hard brittle plastic. A better dsign would either be steel or a bendable memory plastic."
5,New purchase but already happy,I owned the smaller version of this mower and decided I needed the upgrade since we don't mow regularly and our weeds can get thick and high at the beginning of the seson. This did the trick cutting through the 3 foot high weeds and grass without a problem. Old mower still running well after 6 years. I'm happy.
4,B/D MM675 Electric Lawn Mower,"I've only used one other electric lawn mower and that was a B/D twin blade from the 70's. This model mower is fairly nice, but is heavier than the older model. The flip handle is a worthwhile feature and the foam handle grip, while comfortable, was easily ripped on bush limbs. As mentioned in earlier reviews, the grass discharge chute falls off too easily when bumped into. The on/off/safety lever design is inconvenient. There should be a separate on/off button w/ a safely bar across the entire handle like other mowers. Also, the opening where the electrical cord is looped through is too small for a 12g cord.Bottom line: After making mowers at least since the early 70's, the design should be near perfect and it isn't. However, there aren't many choices, so this may be the best to be had. The only other choice was the Yardman and it didn't have the flip handle feature."
5,Excellent mower,"I have no problem with the flip handle or mowing. It bogs down in heavy or high grass but no more than a regular gas mower would. No gas, oil, pollution, or loud noise to put up with makes it wonderful. Pushing it is a breeze and cannot see how anyone has difficulties with it. Even cuts in wet grass without sticking to the deck or bogging down the blade. Definitely recommend it and would buy it again."
4,Great mower but.......,"Works wonderfully and so easy to use. The flip over handle feature is fantastic. Cuts grass beautifully. But....When it arrived and I was assembling, one of the eyelet bolts to connect the handle was misthreaded. As it was too heavy to try and take apart, and no longer in perfect condition from attempts to attach the nut, I was unable to return and had to purchase new parts from a parts dealer to replace faulty bolt. I am now unable to unattach the old bolt, so a little frustrating but for the wonderful price and the otherwise high quality mower it is worth the small extra expense and aggravation."
4,Very pleased,"We bought this mower because my husband had had shoulder surgery this spring and could not start our large, self-propelling gasoline mower. I have never been able to start it. By the time we bought this mower our grass had been growing awhile. People all around us had already mowed two or three times. The mower had absolutly no problem handling that high grass. It takes a little longer to finish the lawn because of dealing with the cord, but knowing that you're helping the environment plus knowing you can turn it off any time and restart with no problem makes that a small matter. Another bonus is that you aren't inhaling fumes as you go. All in all, so far we are very satisfied with this purchase."
1,If your buying a lawnmower don't buy this one.,"If your thinking of buying a new lawnmower I would suggest you save your money and don't buy this one. If you like to cut your grass early in the morning when the grass is even a little wet you will have nothing but problems, all that will happen is that the grass will stick to the side of the lawnmower and plug the exit shoot.If you want to multch don't even think about doing it with this lawnmower, there is barely enough power to cut the grass never mind multch."
4,"No Local Gas, Oil, Fumes, or Smog","With sufficient power and width, this is a great mower for a small and well-kept lawn. Plenty of power to mow grass and no local emisssions, just electricity (which of course is generated somewhere else). The housing is plastic and does not appear it would stand up to rocks and sticks. The flip handle is very useful in maintaining the electric cord (over which you do not want to cut). One must think carefully about cutting patterns to keep the extension cord from under the mower. Height adjustment is simple, with all four wheels adjusted from a single lever. This does prevent tilted cutting, which is occasionally used. All in all I'm pleased with performance, price, and results."
5,lawn mower review,"BLACK DECKER ELECTRIC HOG LAWNMOWER WITH FLIP HANDLE IS EASY TO USE,CUTS WELL. FLIP HANDLE A MUST TO KEEP CORD FROM BEING CUT."
5,This mower is great,"I bought this mower because I had an old on given to me by a friend, that still works. It's about 20 years old. This one is much nicer and I use it a lot more than I thought I would. When you don't want to mess with gas this is the best choice. I wish they would make an electric rider."
3,Lawn Hog,"A durable electric mower is a nice idea for small square yards. I used the mower once and i can see the durability is going to be poor. Already the grass discharge door spring is broken which leaves the door in a half open muching position and the cable of the flip handle has stretched so that it jumps out of the locked position. My mower came with a black plastic discharge spout when installed, allows the mower to throw the grass out when not being used in the mulching position. The problem here is the black plastic discharge is held on by a spring mechanism that releases with the slightest pressure from passing bushes or uneven ground.A real frustration to say the least. The power although not up to gas mover standards is adequate provded you don't let the grass get ahead of your mowing schdule. Black and Decker needs to do better."
1,Terrible experience,"The on/off handle (which is plastic) burns after 10 minutes of first usage. My hand holding the handle got hurt. I had to return it, but packing and shipping such a bulk item was a hassle!"
5,This Mobile Is A Must-Have for the Honey Bee Set!,"This Honey Bee Mobile is absolutely adorable! The bees are super soft and cute and the music the mobile plays is sweet and relaxing. Plus, there's no extra motor noise from the mobile spinning or the music playing, all you hear is the soft lullaby music! It snaps very easily onto the crib railing and is sturdy once attached. It compliments the Honey Bee Crib Set perfectly and adds an extra special touch to an already gorgeous set."
5,Lead to a love of histroy and reading,"As a child it was Knight Crusader and the other Ronal Welch books which started a life of a love of history and reading. If you can get hold of a copy, buy it and read it. Knight Crusader is a great read for all ages. The history of the Cruaders, adventure of life at the time and characters you will never forget. I do hope that some day soon all of Welch's books will be re printed and promoted, so that others may enjoy."
1,Susan Cayleff DID NOT do Babe justice--PERIOD!,"If you want a REAL BOOK on the REAL BABE read ""The Incredible Babe"" Her Ultimate Story by Thad S. Johnson. After reading Johnson's book, one will realize quite quickly Susan Cayleff obviously didn't do her homework! Dallas Morning News even said that ""The Incredible Babe"" by Thad Johnson could very well be the most comprehensive sports book EVER WRITTEN--read it and see for yourself! It will amaze you!!!"
3,"Great message, great acting.","I bought this film mainly for the Biblical message. For that it was fairly well done. It went along with the Bible for the most part but some of the acts were very difficult to make out what Bible story they were trying to portray. The filming is terrable, shaky camera work and most of the film is slightly out of focus. There are no adults in the movie, only child actors, which makes the film more innocent in nature. After all we all come to God as a child. That is scriptural. All of the children do an excelent job of acting. There is child nudity in the film briefly at the beginning and the end. Although the nudity is tasteful and fits the part of Adam and Eve. The ending is the best, where Satan finds out that he has not seperated God from man and he apears upset about it. Rightfully he should be. I gave the rating as 3 stars mainly due to the camera work. I know it was low budget but that could have been done better."
3,Good concept,"The Annunciation had a good concept but it wasn't written well, hence the three stars. For child actors in their first film they did the best that they could but you can't expect quality if the script is written horrible. I would still recommend it for people who like foreign films though."
1,Save your money,"Having read the other reviews I was intruiged enough to watch this movie. Honestly, it was terrible. The film is sub-titled and the language was stilted and hard to believe. The film was almost impossible to follow. I find it hard to believe that anyone could say that there was suberb acting by the cast, mostly they stood around and talked phycho-babble. As I have said in my title, please save your money."
1,Poor performances,The woodwinds and strings at times seem to disagree on rythmns and in in the slow music I find the phrasing laboured...not for me. I really find the problem to be the concept of the live performance here leaves out some of the polish we would come to expect from such great people as George Szell.
3,1951 book has its drawbacks,"I purchased this book because I enjoy all sorts of embroidery and thought it might discuss Norway's hardanger stitching. But it doesn't. What is good about the book is that it has a detailed discussion of lace from its inception to contemporary times accompanied by how each type is made, where, and since when. I was surprised to see just how many types of laces there are: 50 are listed. There is a good discussion of how to spot machine lace from handmade. B&W; photos accompany the text. What is not so good about the book is there is no table of contents, index, chapters, bibliography or source of information. It focuses almost exclusively on France and Belgium with brief mention of other countries in Europe.This book fills a very fine notch in an embroiderer's library. Only the most devoted would find it useful."
2,Works well enough,"This is a carbon-fiber, round, lighted gear shift knob. It uses two button-type batteries, so be prepared for that. After a month or so, one of the screws in the top disappeared, so now it looks odd. It is comfortable and the lights are fun. I show the car quite a bit in the summer and a lot of those shows are at night, so this will work for interior effects. I think it is a little pricey, though, for what you get."
2,Nice look but cheaply made,"Within a week of install the LEDs stopped functioning properly....could be a case of needing fresh batteries but even so that's ridiculous given that it's right out of the package and I haven't turned on the lights much. Plus the mesh has a drawback, if you have anything on your hand it scrapes it off and it's a pain to clean the little holes. All in all it's pretty, but ultimately not worth the money in my opinion."
2,"Looks great, but not durable","For my particular vehicle the adapters included with this knob worked, but the screws to keep it mounted kept coming loose leaving me with a wobbly shift knob. I had to wrap my shifter with electrical tape to give them something to grab onto. The LED light looks neat & I like that you can change the color of the light or have it rotate through. However my batteries seemed to die even though I didn't leave the lights on for any long period of time. 2nd time replacing the batteries broke the little battery compartment & the top button flew off into parts unknown. Oh well..."
1,cheap.,Has the whole carbon fiber thing going on. It's cool because you can change the light settings to several colors and it also has an alternating color choice. But that's where it ends. The carbon fiber top is cheaply made and if you do a lot of shifting (driving in traffic) its bound to break. The light button itself didn't last long before it just stopped working. It's nice and if it was 15 dollars cheaper it'd be a decent buy. But for 25+ dollars you're better off getting something less likely to break. Had this shifter for a little over a year. It broke about 4 months ago.
5,Chinese Products work!,"This product is from 1 manufacturer overseas and has been relabeled by a dozen vendors. My vendor happened to be Mad Dog. Nonetheless, the product is great! Waterproof, easy to install, the only 3-compartment, softshelled cargo carrier with seat that I have found in Mossy Oak. There are NO others out there. This configuration does come in BLACK but no longer available in mossy oak from any other vendors. If you can get this item, simply buy it now, because most other vendors are out of stock on this!"
5,Love this bag!,"This is a great bag! It is very sturdy, well-made, and best of all keeps most of the dirt and water out even in harsh riding conditions. It fits my Honda Recon perfectly, and while the padded seat is somewhat unnecessary during rides, it does come in handy when breaking for lunch and just wanting to change positions.Really happy with this bag. Highly recommended!"
3,Screenplay,"It is a ggod book, but in the entertainment word it is not what you know, but who you know."
4,A GOOD CHOICE FOR BEGINNING HOBBYISTS.,"MOST LONG-TIME HOBBYISTS WILL HAVE PURCHASED MOST OF THESE ITEMS, BUT FOR THE BEGINNERS OR THE HOBBYIST WANNABES, THIS IS AN IDEAL GIFT. THE PRICE IS GREAT, AS IS THE NECESSITY OF THE ITEMS IN THE SET."
5,excellent classic comedy,"This is a great oldie that makes light of road trips, getting married/honeymoons, hauling something with a vehicle and collecting momentos. The experience is all too real for those who have traveled on self-planned trips or are do-it yourself types with regard to travel."
5,"Te Long, Long ,Trailer","A movie filled with everything romance, comedy,and drama.This is an enjoyable movie for the entire family. There aren't movies like this one any more. The plot of this movie is Tacy(Ball) convinces her husband (Arnaz) to buy a trailer for them to live in insted of a house. They would travel across the country picking up momentos along the way. They would eventualy ssettle down and live where they wanted. Ball stays true to her usual charecter that somehow always finds herself in crazy situations that noone else could. I have always loved this movie ever since the first time I saw it even though it was before my time. I would recomend this movie to any Lucy fan,or just someone who enjoys comedys."
5,Best Lucy Comedy Ever Made,"I love this movie.I still end up laughing while watching it. Lucy is not annoyingly slapstick, but her timing and skill is at it's peak. Desi is not just one dimensional, and the situations feel quite ""real"" while being incredibly funny.The scenery of California, before the massive growth there, are just incredible.A relative was on the shoot for this movie. Those rocks that fall as that trailer goes up the mountain? REALLY WERE FALLING. That entire section was filmed as it happened, and one driver bailed because he was too scared to continue that drive.ENJOY it, you are in for a treat if you want to see a truly fine old movie."
4,The Long Long Trailer Has A Long Long Life To Live,"What a wonderful movie. I could identify with it as I just got involved with trailering and took an 11 day, 3200 mile trip up and down the East Coast. I would have been happy to give it 5 stars if it weren't for some slight technical and character flaws in the film. Ex: car swapping from the Mercury to the Lincoln for the final mountain scenes along with Desi's character's whimsical approach to ""burn and learn"" which of course is deadly when trailering. That aside, I absolutely loved the story and watched it over and over to savor the relationship not between Lucy and Desi but MAN and MACHINE. That is the true ""vehicle"" of which the movie is really about."
5,great movie,This is the very first movie I saw in a theater...I was 3 years old! I still remember how funny it was...I can't wait to see it again!
5,Hilarious movie!,This movie was hilarious and I watch it all the time. It's so cute to see them in color and the jokes and physical comedy were marvelous.
5,Funny and Nostalgic,"We bought an Airstream trailer this past July and several people said we should check out this movie. I'd seen it as a kid, but only had a vague memory. It was fun to watch it again. I just have to say that Ricky (as a beginner) makes backing up a 30+ foot trailer look way to easy."
4,A 53 Merc,"Ok -- why did I buy this movie? Easy, in 1956 I bought a used 53 Merc during my second year of college. One of the all-time great babe cars ever made! In my opinion, the 53 Merc convertible is the big star of what is really a surprisingly pretty good flilm. Lucy and Desi really charm, as does Yosemite National Park in this movie. Too bad, that Desi and Lucy never did another flic as good as this one."
4,The Long Long Trailer,"This movie is extremely funny. Although the two main characters are from the I Love Lucy show, it is completely different. It shows a lot of the same funny whim, but it also has serious spots throughout the movie. It's a great choice."
4,A vintage comedy delight!,"Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz made this movie at a time when their TV show ""I Love Lucy"" was booming! It's a delightful movie and one never tires of seeing it over and over again. Look for one particular blooper; there's a scene where Taci (Lucy) is sleeping in the living room and gets scared, running through the trailer. Instead of screaming Nicky's (Desi's) name, she accidentally calls out for ""Ricky"", her TV husband's name. This chronicles the tale of a couple who purchase a trailer at a time when they cost more than stick-built homes and were ""the"" preferred mode of travel for those who could afford it!If you're looking for a movie you can watch with your children, this is it!!"
5,GOOD MOVIE,-*WHEN WILL YOU BE PUTING IT ON DVD. THE VHS IS HARD TO FINDIT IS SUCH A GOOD MOVIE. WOULD LIKE TO HAVE IT IN DVD.THANK_YOU
5,From a time when trailers were a sign of prosperity!,"Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz made us laugh for years. For those ""I Love Lucy"" fans, you shouldn't miss this movie!Watch for the bloopers: Lucy runs to the back of the trailer calling ""Ricky"" instead of ""Nicky"" and at one time their Mercury convertible turns into a Lincoln convertible!Remember this movie was made at a time when living in a trailer was a sign of prosperity. At trailer camps of the day, you would see new Cadillacs, Lincolns, Chryslers, and other fine cars of the day parked proudly in front of the trailer."
5,Still Loving Lucy and Desi,"I can still remember watching the original ""I Love Lucy"" as a young girl when all of a sudden a commercial came on for ""The Long Long Trailer."" Our family was so excited....and it was in color! How cool. Loved the movie then and love it now. It has also been a real treat watching my eleven-year-old grandson and his family enjoy these treasures of yesteryear.Thanks so much for making these videos available to the public today."
5,GREAT movie.............,I have seen this movie many times and it just gets better and better. Desi & Lucy are so great together in this movie. Never get tired of seeing this. A giving this DVD as a gift to a newly married couple.
5,the long long trailer,"I love their movies but, The Long Long Trailer has to be the best Lucille Ball and Desi Arnez movies ever!"
3,ok,"I almost turned this off half-way through, but the second half made it more watchable with a few funny, entertaining, and suspenseful moments. It's a quaint and charming time-capsule, but I almost wish they were portraying their I Love Lucy roles in this film."
3,Great Slapstick Compensates For Lack Of Plot,"Although it contains a great cast and beautiful background, THE LONG, LONG TRAILER falls short of human interest and is a little mellow at times. Although the slapstick is often surprisingly hilarious at times, it is kind of hard to think of this as a film, but rather as an episode of THE LUCY-DESI COMEDY HOUR without Fred and Ethel. Satisfying antics, slim plot."
3,LUCY AND DESI IN COLOR,"NOBODY loves Lucy as much as I do but I really feel this movie ISN'T very good. I recently saw it (again) after many years and I was disappointed at just how stagebound and artificial the sets were, and in the laugh lines which weren't too many. In my opinion most ANY episode of I LOVE LUCY is far funnier. It's strange, because the team's second full length feature (FOREVER DARLING) was a complete flop (with the masses and the critics, anyway) and the hour long Lucy/Desi shows seemed forced -perhaps it is in the timing and the writing that the 180 episodes of I LOVE LUCY work and these longer features don't.......... Nicki and Tacey Collini simply aren't as funny as Lucy and Ricky Ricardo! Marjorie Main was wasted in what little she had to do. Regrettably, I found this epic to be more than a little on the dull and corny side."
5,MEMORIES,I CAN REMEMBER SEEING THIS MOVIE WHEN I WAS YOUNG AND I AM A BIG LUCY FAN SO THIS IS NICE TO HAVE IN MY MOVIE COLLECTION. IT REALLY TAKES ME BACK TO THE SIMPLE MOVIE DAYS.
4,Forgot how funny this movie is,"I recently bought this, used, from a co-worker - the best $8.00 I've spent in a long time. I'd forgotten how laugh-out-loud funny it is but then I'd also forgotten that it was directed by Vincente Minelli, the master of domestic comedy. Has anyone else noticed the split second timing of certain scenes in Minelli movies when everyone is talking at once but the viewer doesn't miss a word?"
3,"Great, great fun!",I remember seeing this on TV when I was a kid. One of Mothers favorite and now my wife's favorite. Desi and Lucy are just any young couple who travel across country in very tight quarters.
4,Funny,"I have not exactly seen this 'entire' film but from the hour or so that I did see.......Whoa! I think that was enough for one night! Comedy at its top you could see anything coming even if t wasn't going to! If you love ""I Love Lucy"" shows.....I really don't even have to say that you will love this movie."
4,Too long to drive,"THE LONG, LONG TRAILER was indeed finny but somewhat disappointing. I had hoped for the characters I'd loved in TV's ""I Love Lucy"" but this is no Lucy and Ricky saga although there are scenes, especially the one with Lucy trying to prepare dinner in a moving trailer, that could easily have been on the beloved 1950s TV program. Another very funny sequence is the wedding, in which the bride and groom barely have a chance to say a word to each other. And, of course, the scenes depicting driving a too long trailer are all good.Perhaps, as sometimes happens with DVDs, we'll like it better on the second viewing when we'll no longer be expecting Lucy and Ricky. For now I can't truly give it 5 stars."
3,Gift,"This DVD item was a Christmas gift so have not, as of this writing, presented the item to the receiver."
3,The Long Trailer,"The dvd itself was in good condition with no problems. It was a good movie with typical Lucy-Desi humor, but not really how I remember it to be. I thought the trailer they bought was a Silver Bullet. But it's been probably 50 years since I last saw it and I was very young then. However, I'm glad that I purchased it and it was good to see it again. :)"
3,"The Long, Long Trailer Review by Nicky Rao","This is a hilarious movie, especially when the trailer door opens and the doorbell goes off all the time. Starring Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz.The couple has just gotten married, and buys a trailer home to live in. They have a lot of adventures on the way, like falling out the door and landing in mud. Or preparing a really good meal but gets ruined. It is just the same probably as an I Love Lucy show. I can't tell, I like both.This is a funny movie for all ages, kids or adults, it is a classic comedy."
4,"Great funny movie filmed in widescreen, but on dvd - not widescreen",The title says it all.They need a widescreen version of this film on dvd.
5,"The Long, Long Trailer.","Dont think this Movie will ever date just seems with age to get better. Everything that has been thought and said about this Movie I 100% agree, it is the best one they ever did together. I just love the whole thing about this movie what more can I say, the best!!!"
5,I love Lucy & Desi,"""The Long, Long Trailer"" has always been one of my very favorite movies. It is so funny and colorful and the type of movie you can be proud to watch with your family. Lucy and Desi always worked wonderfully together and this movie is no exception. There are so many funny scenes to watch out for. There are also some very touching scenes and some musical numbers thrown in for good measure. Included on the DVD is the original trailer (a trailer within a trailer) and 2 MGM shorts. If you liked the trailer you'll love the movie :)."
4,The Long Long Trailer,"I saw this movie on TCM, and had to have it! It's a great movie for those who can relate to taking that long trip, beginning a new life, relatives, and youth! I laughed and laughed! Lucy and Desi really did a great job in this movie. Great comedy! Amazon was one of the few places I could get a copy."
5,DVD of Lucy & Desi,"I loved this dvd. We recently bought a long, long RV and we laughed at the similarities of events that we went thru on our first and second trip in it. Great memories already."
4,"The Long, Long Trailer",Very typical Lucille Ball and Desi Arnez. I found the movie very funny and entertaining and would recommend it to all the baby boomers and families. Especially those who have traveled with a mobile home.
5,10 star movie!,This is one of the best movies in the whole world. How in the hell could anyone give it less than a 5 star rating. One person who wrote a review said he enjoyed the movie and then gave it a 1 star. Why would he do that??? This is a 5 star movie!!!! I've watched it several times!!!
2,northernrivers,"Sorry to offend all the Lucille Ball fans....but I didn't like this movie. In fact, I fell asleep watching it. Maybe, I should watch it again......and see how I go next time. This time though, I found it boring. Two stars is the absolute most I would give it."
2,Not again!,I have been forced to watch this OLD movie for over 13 years of my life. Personally I think it is a little corny. But I may feel this way b/c my dad loves this movie a little 2 much!
4,"Expands your mind, thinking and perception!","This book is both an experiential and conceptual exploration of the future that expands your thinking, mind, and perception.....The concepts are intriguing, the mode of presentation engaging, the vision for the future inspiring.....I certainly found myself undergoing perceptual shifts, tapping into new abilities (perceptual and otherwise)and feeling highly enthusiastic about what's coming down the pike - as well as a desire to help share these ideas! The book acts as both a catalyst and a guide....if you pay attention, you definitely find your ideas shifting in sometimes subtle, other times major ways.....I highly recommend this book not only in and of itself, but as a counter-balance to the sometimes chaotic, negative whirl of external events in the world...it provides a positive vision and practical steps for helping to expand your potential and create a more harmonious world."
1,The Return of the Hippie,"Did you know that in 2020 we will have machines that measure love?Did you know that in 2020 all they will talk about is love exchange?Did you know that in 2020 you will be able to agree telepathically with your future baby to avoid pregnancy?Give me a break, this book just established a personal record: from the box to the trash in a few hours."
4,"Light, Sturdy, Quality","I played a few games I bought the racquet. Seems well made and has a wide range of playable surface. However, I noticed it was slightly narrower and shorter than my previous racquet. It took a game or two to get used to it but control and power it offers is well worth the trade-off. The only thing that surprised me was the style of the grip. The one advertised is not the one I received, it seems. Even on the cardboard attached to the racquet, it said it had a clear grip but the one it had was black. Not really a big deal though. If you buy this, prepare to have your game kicked up a tiny notch."
2,muy llamativo pero no duradero,"el producto es muy llamativo,lo use para llevar la comida diariamente a mi trabajo, y bues los primero meses funciono ala perfeccion pero luego empezo a seder la capa externa y se fue rompiendo, un punto negaticvo es que no tiene compartimiento, no recomiendo este producto si se va usar a diario."
2,Not for kids,"My 8 year old is a picky eater, so I picked up this book. With the exception of the ""I Can't Believe I'm Doing This"" recipes which generally involve a lot of fat and cheese, she won't eat anything in the book. The author seems to forget that picky eaters don't like their food mixed together. And, quite frankly, I don't need ideas like grilled hamburgers or spaghetti with cheese on it. My husband and I do like some of the recipes, Greek Beef Stew being our favorite, so I did give the book another star for that. If you have a picky adult eater in the house, this book would probably be helpful."
4,Single Dad says: BUY IT!!!,"The kids may or may not see fit to eat the meals you prepare from this book, but it's a hoot to leaf through it and read Ms. Hodgman's comments and tales of trying to get the little ones to EAT something other than chocolate! I thought some of the recipes sounded like non-starters as far as my own kids went, but most of them are worth making at least once, and who knows? You might actually find something that appeals to your own fussy eaters!"
2,Why wouldn't they eat it?,"I found most of these recipes to be full of sugar and high fat ingredients. I am by no means an extremist on the subject, but I just did not feel these meals were very healthy. A better choice is Desperation Dinners, in my opinion."
2,"Funny alright, but.......","Yes, it is a humorous read. It has some good ideas. But these recipes rely heavily on processed convenience foods which I am trying to shift AWAY from using. The ""Sneaky Chef"" books are better, with more of a reliance on fresh veggies and home-cooked foods. What I am wishing for is a cookbook for picky eaters (which is me) that has NO recipes containing cheese or yogurt. THAT is the pickiness in this household and I have not found ONE SINGLE cookbook to suit me. I tried out this book from the library. I will not be buying a copy. As it turns out, I AM the pickiest eater on earth, and this book is not for me."
3,Why?,"I recently purchased 'One Bite Won't Kill You' by Ann Hodgman, and while her wit has me laughing out loud, and the recipes sound great, why must she use the expression ""godd**n"" (twice) in the introduction. Personally I find it offensive and in poor taste. Kind of ruins, for me anyway, what otherwise looks like a book I could definitely use with my finicky four year old."
2,Why its two stars,"The first two songs are amazing, the rest of the cd lags. I cant think of what else to write haha"
1,it sucks a fat one,i wasted 12 mf'n dollaz on that s**t. then i through it out the window on i95. p.s learn ha to rap
1,Hateful music,This is a lot of hateful music written by a bunch of thugs. Whatever the reason why this is so popular would help explain the decline of Western civilization. Too bad I couldn't give this zero stars
5,Classic,"This album is a classic. And even better, a must have classic. This is awesome, and if u don't have this then u better get it"
5,Truly a classic!,"The best gangsta rap album of all time. Forget compilations, forget greatest hits. This is straight thru, front to back."
5,The,"When I first bought NWA's Straight Outta Compton, I was amazed by the music I heard. It is one CD that you never get tired of, there's always some track that you haven't got the oppertunity to play, that turns out to be your favorite track. Every single track on Straight Outta Compton is a master piece. The most notavle tracks are Gangsta Gangsta, Straight Outta Compton, and Compton's in the House. If you enjoy rap as much as I do(which would be insanly a lot), don't mind the language and content, and like various artists such as Dr. Dre(formaly in NWA), Snoop Dogg, and Tupac, you will be sure to enjoy Straight Outta Compton as much as I do."
4,U GOTTA GET THIS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Dude this album STARTED gangsta rap! This is a must have 4 any rap fan! It has the classic songs F--- Tha Police, Express Yourself, I Ain't Tha 1, and Dopeman! Y'all gotta buy this!"
5,CLASSIC,"Hip Hop classic- This album set the stage for all of the gun totin, blunt smokin, crack slangin hardheads out there (if that's good or bad, that's on you).Attitude, hard lyrics, tight production. You can't lose. The original group- Cube, Eazy, Dre, Ren, Yella- was THE rap supergroup.If you listen to it in 1998, its just as relevant as it was 10 years ago- thats a classic."
4,The album that started gangsta rap...,"The original gangsta rap album, NWA's Straight Outta Compton introduced guns, dope-slanging and gang behaviour to hip-hop, as well as introducing to the rap scene Dr. Dre, Ice Cube, MC Ren, Eazy E and DJ Yella. ""**** Tha Police"" was so controversial that it even attracted attention from the FBI, while tracks like ""I Ain't Tha One"" prompted accusation of casual misogyny despite Ice Cube's definite and eloquent explanation on exactly why this is not so, and Dopeman actually warns against drug use: ""If you smoke 'caine, you a stupid mother****er."" Overall, the album is hilarious yet still true to life and educational on a street level; the album opens with, ""You are now about to witness the strength of street knowledge."" And anyone with half a brain should be able to understand it."
2,"Yo man, lets down this whackass cafeteria sushi and bounce","Straight Outta Compton my ***. Dr. Dre, Easy E, and Ice Cube are from Woodland Hills and all went to the William Howard Taft High School along with Lisa Kudrow of Friends, Everlast and Fez (Wilmer Valderrama) of That Seventies Show. Woodland hills has a 3.4% black population, and a 80% white one. In 2000 the median house price was $950,000 and in 2000 the median income was $72,568, in 2009 its $89,946. Yeah man thats the 'hood all right."
2,Very cheaply made costume,"Thin, cheap fabric, not to be compared to other better made ""deluxe"" fireman costumes. Will not last long. Be prepared to purchase another, higher quality item soon if your child really loves to play in it"
2,Kind of offensive and tiresome,"I suppose that man-whores like this do exist in real life, but all the gratuitous sex seemed, well, gratuitous. And the 'tension' of the still alive connection with his ex-wife, in which he wishfully pursues her yet continues to cluelessly ruin his life and can't get her back, seems contrived. I just couldn't get involved in the story or the premise."
5,love!,"I absolutely love Californication, me and my husband watch it all the time and have waited forever for the 4th season to come out, I finally found it on here! and it was such a great price! my husband is over seas so i had purchased it and sent it to him. he's going to love it, thank you Amazon :D"
5,Happy customer,I was very pleased with the quick service in handling my order. The DVD arrived ahead of time in great condition. I would certainly recommend buying from and advising other of my good experience.
3,Losing its edge,"""Californication"" has become a disappointment. Sure, there are some hysterical moments in Season 4 (most of which involve Rob Lowe), but the big problem with this show is that there are quickly becoming fewer and fewer reasons to like the character of Hank Moody. In this season, Hank faces statutory rape charges, but because of the situation, it really isn't his fault and viewers don't hate him for what happened with Mia. However, his constant drunkenness, lack of concern for his teenage daughter, constant couplings with less than admirable women, and general inadequateness make it very hard to feel sorry for this guy. I almost don't want Hank and Karen to end up together because her character is so amazing and she could do so, so, SO much better than Hank! We'll see what Season 5 brings."
1,My post to amazon customer service.,"My wife and I rented ""Bimbos BC"" last evening, we expected a bad ""B"" movie, we expected something to laugh at, we got a video that was not quite as good as a 1980's Highschool production This ""movie"" was not bad in an amusing way,it was bad in a theft of money way. It was so bad I am making the effort to get my $2 back. Please post a preview of this movie so that your customers can see what they are renting. I am confident that there is no way to make a preview that would entice anyone to rent this awful ""production""[end customer service letter]This movie has no redeeming features.understand that your choice to rent this movie for $1.99 will make you sad and depressed, it will make you think about the people out in the world that would make this. please don't.this movie really is ""that"" bad.really.you can e-bay me $1.99, you'll enjoy it more."
1,Not worth 20 let alone 120,These boots are extremely uncomfortable. The inside of the boot isn't seamless like most others. You can feel the area where they sewed the lip on. It protrudes about a quarter inch in the boot and will dig into your toes or the top of your feet. They made a horrible day for the kid i was with. He got his for 20 bucks on clearance and he got ripped off
5,Excellent,"This book is wonderful. I am the dance leader of my church and assit with other dance teams as well and it provided me with great information to allow me the strength and knowledge to pass to all those that I teach to minster through dance! I would recommend this book to anyone on a dance team, lead a dance ministry or just interested in dancing in the church!"
5,"An excellent book - objective, beautiful, sometimes chilling","An informative, wonderful, and chilling read - I recommend it to anyone who is interested in the CE4 phenomenon. This book gives the reader a good look at what it is like both to be an experiencer, and to be a therapist who works with experiencers. It has a lot of excellent insights for both. What I liked most was that Constance avoided interjecting her own views on the close encounter phenomenon. I also liked Constance's appendix material, including her example Ericksonian induction."
5,Personal Friend,"Constance was an amazing person. I know the individuals in this book. Reading this book, happening to live in the same town was how I met Constance. I was not a patient just a friend. Even in her private life she remained impartial and made a careful decision not to take sides (is this a positive or negative phenomenon)but instead provided support in any decision that was best and the truth for the experiencer. These event continue to this day, they wax and wane. This effects every aspect of your life, your relationships, your tolerance of those around you. After all how can you empathize with a flat tire in the pouring rain when you remember in vivid detail something no one will ever believe. We all miss Constance she died doing what she loved best and our only hope is that she is happy, healthy and content where ever she is."
2,Silly but fun,"By the time this one came out, the formula was pretty threadbare. In what was to be the last of the Frankenstein/Dracula/Wolfman series, the Universal monsters converge on a clinic seeking a cure. Dracula shows up, followed by the Wolfman, who, while stumbling through a cave with the latest mad scientist, conveniently happens upon the Frankenstein monster. It seems that old Frank was fortunate enough to wash ashore under the good doctor's castle. That's when the fun really begins. This is about as contrived as it gets, but it's entertaining at times. John Carradine reprises his role as Dracula; he's no Bela Lugosi, but is far better in the role than Chaney was. So, enjoy it for what it is. It's not great, but not bad either."
1,A TOTAL WASTE!,"This DVD would not play in my DVD player (either - this is the second one I purchased). I know I probably purchased the wrong DVD, but I can't tell one from the other."
1,House of Disapointments,"Dracula, the Wolfman, and the Frankenstein creature are at it again in this second movie that they team-up, find a scientist who wants to cure them all. Sub-standard horror film of the 1940's with no plot to speak of and predictable ending."
2,Lame,"This movie good have been skipped over by Universal completley. Dracula is once again played badily by Carridine. and it is never explained how Dracula and the Wolfman who were killed in House of Frankenstein come back to life, If you want to see the next installment Aboott and Costello meet Frankenstein I highly recommmend it."
3,Universal's Monster Finale,"Erle C. Kenton directed this superior follow-up to ""House of Frankenstein"" and closed the lid on Universal's monster franchise. ""House of Dracula"" (1945) remains among the studio's better sequels, with effective gothic atmosphere and taut pacing. Onslow Stevens' sympathetic performance as the dedicated yet doomed Dr. Edelman holds the film together - memorably assisted by John Carradine's Dracula, Lon Chaney Jr.'s Wolf Man and (all too briefly) Glenn Strange's Frankenstein Monster. Due to budgetary shortcuts, the disappointing climax is mostly comprised of stock footage from 1942's ""The Ghost of Frankenstein."""
3,HOUSE OF DRACULA,"After watching this one several times, I realized its many faults. While the story and performances are not too shabby, all of the monsters are too rushed.It is a terrible shame that Chaney's Wolfman didn't do anything or kill anyone in his two scenes as the werewolf. The whole movie is pretty much set around Dracula who wants a ""cure"" for vampirism. The ""Jekyll/Hyde"" sequence with Dr. Edelmann(Stevens) is clever and the most exciting part in the film. As with HOUSE OF FRANKENSTEIN, Glen Strange's Monster came to life in the ending, and it was mainly footage from GHOST OF FRANKENSTEIN( which I admit was well put into the film!). The conclusion was too rushed and wasn't at all as fun as the ending of FRANKENSTEIN MEETS THE WOLFMAN. A more creative way should have been used to destroy the Monster. Despite its many faults, you shouldn't view HOUSE OF DRACULA as a critic, analyzing every little fault, but it should be seen as a fun horror movie and should be enjoyed as a fun experience!"
1,Beware Region 2 DVD's will not play in the USA,"The DVD will not play in the USA, I don't hate the movie, just the fact I could not watch it, the seller replied back very timely. attached is his reply:Hi,Thank you for your e-mail, the item you ordered is Region 2 DVD therefore it can only be played on a European or multi region DVD player this information can be seen in our comments section. We are a UK company and will be unable to replace this item as we only sell region 2 DVD's. However we will be happy for you to return this to us at,CHALKYSBUTCHERS ROWBANBURYOXONOX16 5JHUnited KingdomPlease include your order number and reason for return in the packet for a full refund (we will accept returns if the DVD has been openedKind Regards,Harry BrownOxfordshireEngland"
2,Bring on Abbott & Costello,"This has to be one of the lamest of all Universal's horror endeavors. The sets are classic and gothic, but the plot is a hodge-podge of thrown together pieces. You have the norm - a continually tormented Larry Talbot, who does get cured of his transformations by having his skull enlarged, the Frankenstein monster is found in a cave w/ the skeletal remains of Dr. Neimann (see House of Frankenstein), and an unconvincing stupid performance by John Carridine as Dracula. Oh yes, he comes seeking an end for his life (dahhhh, just stand in the sun!). Oh yes, that's how he gets it in the end. What's left to do? Bring on Abbott & Costello, which is exactly what Universal did. If you're a collector - get it. If not, skip it!"
1,This Sucked,"Come on Should Have Stopped at ""Son of Dracula"" it would have been a perfect triogly box set but this was stupid Dracula Here can be destroyed Easy and The Wolf Man Was killed in the previous one ""House of Frankenstein"" by the only way a silver bullet fired by the hand of a loved one Skip this one"
1,3 drawer wicker chest,"This item is an assembly nightmare! If it were not for the hefty shipping charge I would have returned it. I made the assumption that at least the drawers would be assembled, not 7 flat pieces per drawer! Insert one side and the other side would pop out- it took 2 of us plus a hammer to assemble these small drawers. There were no printed directions, only sketchy schematic pictures. My husband and I both have Ph.Ds- we could have managed to read directions! It did look nice when we got it all done but I definitely would not recommend it."
1,piece of crap,This was a waste of time and money its like a toy camera!My fifty dollar Intel takes better pictures.I cant wait to send it back.
2,A cold day in hell,"The duo Cold World Hustlers was part of a San Francisco rap collective with groups 11/5 and U.D.I., releasing 1995's ""Iceland"" on Priority a few months after U.D.I.'s debutUnder Da Influence. You'd be hard-pressed to find two albums that are more similar. E-Sic and Big Vic are nearly identical rappers to their buddies Dig and Quint, and the album succeeds and suffers in the same areas. Production is decent overall, operating at a mid-tempo West Coast funk with solid instrumentals. The record tends to be plagued by a formulaic approach, generic lyrics, and uninspired hooks. It's not a very memorable effort. Bay Area fans may find this of nostalgic value, and it appears to have accumulated some value among collectors, but I would not recommend that other listeners pay out-of-print prices for it."
2,Boring Cenci,"This is not a bad movie, yet is a quite dull movie. Beatrice Cenci conspires with familiar relatives to get rid of her mentally twisted nobleman father. As a consequence, several of these people get tortured and killed by some team of inquisitors. The movie some scenes of torture that are well achieved as you might have expected for a Lucio Fulci, very little nudity, not a good pace of action, and a dull story. So, I honestly cannot recommend much here, except may be for those who seek to watch a no terror and not very gory Lucio Fulci film.Technically, a good, region free, DVD widescreen image transfer by Sinister Cinema. The feature runs for about 90 minutes. The film comes with English audio (dubbed) no subtitles."
4,one of lucio fulci's early gems,this is a pretty darn good early lucio fulci film fulci being my favorite director of all time i kinda have a bias towards him and never give his films bad reviews so take my review with a grain of salt not as bloody as his later works but just as creepy this film is not for the weak
5,~Reviewed by Callista Constellar ~ What an exqusite book!!~,"This was a great book, but, hello, there definetly needs to be a sequel. I mean all us readers really want in the sequel is for her to marry Omar and get back together with Mumtaz, right? So why cant Ms. Staples right a good sequel in her spare time? And, in the back cover(paperback) of Havili, there says that she is currently working on a 3rd novel. Is this a sequel to Havili, or just the book Dangerous Skies? Somebody please write a petition to Ms. Staples about a sequel to Havili!!!!!!!!"
5,I loved this book,"The book Haveli was the best book I've ever read. It really touched my heart and I can't wait until I read the next part of Haveli. I think Suzanne Staples is a really good author, and I recommend all of her books because they are really good."
5,A Fabulous Cliffhanger,"A definite must-read! This is a fabulous book about love and deception. However, Suzanne Staples MUST write a sequel or I must say that I will GO INSANE!"
2,Gives a distorted view of Islam,"I would just like all readers to be aware of the fact that in RURAL areas of Pakistan are practices with such early marriages. People who are uneducated and change the face of Islam make up the rules in these provinces. I wish that the author could have acknowledged the fact that a strewed picture of Islam was shown because of the way it was misused. Women aren't treated like meat in Islam, and not all of Pakistan has such old-style rules. It is only the rural areas as I mentioned; the areas where the majority of people are illiterate. As a female of Pakistani descent, it bothered me to read a review saying that 'the real islam' was shown. I hope this reaches the author and shows her how disturbing it is to all Pakistani Muslims when characters who don't know the real beliefs and teachings of Islam are called 'religious.' Thank you."
3,Good but not as much heart,"Haveli was good, but didn't have the same heart or punch as the original. This one seemed more like a soap opera."
2,False information,"I didn't like this book. First of all, the words were wrong. ""Choti"" means small, not monkey, and ""Bundr"" means monkey, not small. Also, There are just so many characters, it's like, oh there's Amina, there's Zabo, there's Omar, there's Naszir, who can keep up with all these people?? Nobody I know has gotten married this young (at 11!) in these modern times. Most women get married when they're well into thier twenties and done with their education, not when they're eleven. That kind of stuff happened back in the old days when Pakistan didn't even exist."
1,Boooring,"I've read ""shabanu"" and it was one of the best books I have ever read, so I decided to buy the sequel. I'm half way through the book and I've had it for about 2 years. The story is very slow paced! and I cant stand that. If you haven't read Shabanu I suggest you read it rather than this."
1,The worst book i have ever read!!!,"I don't know who would enjoy reading this! Am I the only person that can tell that this book is the most boring, uninteresting thing you can find in stores today? Like one other reviewer has said before me, this book is HORRIBLE!!!! If you are looking for an interesting read, DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK; if you are looking to be bored out of your mind, sure, why not!! It is obvious that Suzanne Fisher Staples had no idea what she was doing when she wrote this!"
3,Didn't like the color,I have no complaints about the bag itself. The quality ispretty good. Just the color is not to my liking. Didn't likethe PINK colored patches around the corners of the bag. It would be nice if they were to display the pictures of the bag with all the available colors so that users can make an informed choice.
4,Good value for the $,It is hard to beat the value you get in this set. It contains most of the bits you would need and want. I thought it was odd however that while it contains both metric and english sockets it only has english hex keys. If your a bicyclist like me you know how important metric Allen keys are. The entire set is well layed out and labled
4,Fine Southern Story Telling,"The Handywoman Stories link together to paint a picture of the lives of people in West Virginia's Appalachia from pre WWI forward. Their lives are spare, sometimes wretched, but the people meet their problems straight on. Coberly delivers quirky, humorous, generous and, for the most part, believable characters. The book left me with a warm feeling and a chuckle for Coberly's handywomen of West Virginia."
5,Always handy to have...,"The original owner's manual does not cover most things, as any do-it-yourself mechanic knows. The illustrations in the Haynes Manual cannot be compared to any other."
4,Would have gotten 5 stars but was advertised as chilton and was haynes,Cant beat price condition was just as advertised and recieved promptly.The only beef was it was advertised as Chilton and when arived it was Haynes.
4,Haynes Repair Manual,"Very basic Manual for repair and maintenance. Some discrepency as to different years but with a little research, the correct information was there."
5,Better than expected,"I was surprised at how well made this dragon candle-holder is. It's also slightly heavy and I like that as well.I'm not quite sure what they mean by 'aroma scent'. When I ordered I was under the impression there was a spot for a votive. Wellllll, if you actually put a votive at the bottom and lit it, you'd get a very hot candle holder. This isn't designed as a votive holder. But I still like it and would buy it again."
5,Great Value,I ordered 2 2o packs and the seller sent 50 pieces along with a thank you. Recommend this seller 100%
5,This should not be the first book you buy when you learn Russian...,"I bought this book for my advanced study of Russian, but I bought it before I had even started learning, and it scared me. I served a mission for the LDS church and they suggested this book. It is probably the most comprehensive way to learn grammar. Very Good Book!"
2,You can do MUCH better!,"There are much better options on the market. The price is marginal at best, but considering this unit isn't even car kit-adaptable, you should look elsewhere for a CD player that has better options."
5,A sweet story of love that involves overcoming fear and loss.,"Zach Wright is a big city reporter who is ordered by his boss to take a break from the government conspiracy piece he is writing by reporting on a flood in a small town. He is involved in an automobile accident along the way, and is rescued by a mystery woman. Rebecca is a local chef and Zach's mysterious rescuer. Although sparks fly when they meet and Zach learns who she is, Rebecca has no interest in dating. Can she overcome her fear? Or will Mr. Wright get away?"
5,Everyone Should Read This,"This novel is a masterpiece. Mansbach really takes theory 'to the streets' so to speak, and brings the words of race theorists into a super accesible venue that anyone can enjoy, and that everyone should read.Everyone seems to be raving about the lyrical nature in which Mansbach writes, and while that was amazing, I'm more amazed by the message. It's one you can never iterate enough.Do yourself a favor and check this one out."
5,Have we won the war on racism?,"Nah, kinda hard when few are fightin. This book will make you look at the world a little differently as it reveals to you the constant ignorance surrounding us. A perfect blend of insight on the hip hop culture and a page turning novel."
2,"Great Start, Disappointment Overall","What a disappointment. I truly enjoyed the first two thirds of this book, but the story dropped off so steeply at the end, that the whole book was spoiled in retrospect.It was a great concept, and Mansbach deserves praise for creating believable and three-dimensional characters. But as soon as the story moves beyond New York City, grotesque stereotypes emerge.Macon Detourney was a great character. His imagination is wild, and he tends to interpret the goings-on around him through the lens of TV and popular culture. Unfortunately, the same can be said of Mansbach's relationship to the America outside of New York City. He has seen imagery on TV, but doesn't have the same sense for real and imaginary.The hip hop writing is great."
1,Didn't get very far,"My rule is if I'm reading a book in my free time and I have to force myself to continue, I stop. I got maybe 70 pages into this book before quitting. The author just lacks skill. Every 10 pages there's a 2 page flashback, a gust of wind will remind the protagonist of walking through Boston, someone smoking weed will remind him of hanging with his 5 Percenter friends in New York and how they kind of let him in the group but never completely. Do you get it yet? The storytelling technique is severely lacking. Almost nothing had happened by the time I quit because we kept going on forays into the character's past.If his past is so important and compelling, then make it an actual chapter! Otherwise shut up and get on with the plot!Also, the dialogue is really bad. The use of ebonics and slang is awkward, as if the author doesn't actually speak it himself.There may have been a good plot in here somewhere, I lost the motivation to find it."
1,Disappointment,Such a waste of time. No basis to the book. Completely distorts bible verses out of context. Would not recommend this to anyone.
5,Let God be Lord of your life,"This book in conjunction with God's word has changed my life like never before! It keeps things simple and focused on GOD! It is not exhaustive of itself but definitely points out that God wants US whole. Henry comes from the persective that God loves us perfectly. He forgives us perfectly and wants to heal us perfectly. Henry shows that we have a part in this. Why? Read your bible it is VERY clear that we have a responsibility. God's plan is to work good not evil! How effective are we (in our lives as a whole) if sickness is lording over us instead of God? Do we have the Lordship mastered? I know that I don't and Pastor Henry says that he doesn't either, but isn't that what God wants? Are we working towards sanctification (being set apart to do His plan)? This book reminds us that it is NOT in our strength or works but God's strength working through us. My prayer is that you READ this book along with your bible prayerfully and let God reveal His truth and set you free!"
3,Great place to start!,"I was not overly fond of this book, mostly because of its organization. However, after reading the book I did decide to attend one of Pastor Henry Wright's Seminars. I enjoyed the seminar much more than the book. I believe this book will bring you insight/discernment and can deliver you to a great place where you can get started on the road to healing. The book and Pastor Henry's seminars will help you to look at the sin in your life and to learn about repentance and forgiveness. I also believe, that for many people, this book and Pastor Henry's teaching will lead them to Christ....and that is ""A More Excellent Way""! Read the book and prayerfully consider attending a seminar. What have you got to lose!?"
5,Growing in the spirit.,"I found this book to be most helpful. It brought home the entrances satan uses to place sickness, illness, infirmity and disease on our bodies. It gives us a real root to cut in our healing prayers. The Word says that ""my Children perish for lack of knowledge"". Following the principles in this teaching will bring healing to many who have not understood why their healing has not manifested. Have a teachable heart when you read this book. Ask the Holy Spirit to quicken it to you. It IS Gods will for you to be healed. This book will show you who to credit with your illness and how to come against it. Be blessed as you read this."
5,A More Excellent way,This is an excellent book on Healing. A unique outlook on things.A good book for ministers or lay people interested in healing or in the healing and inner healing. Especially good for those in ministry.
4,A More Excellent Way: Be In Health,"This book is fascinating. The writing is matter-of-fact, every statement he makes he backs up scripturally. It has really made me look at myself differently."
2,"so beautiful, but always broken","This is a beautiful dollhouse that is so perfectly designed for play, BUT. The first one came out of the box with splits in the middle of the glued panelling and when i screwed it together, the top floor and main floor didn't come together properly so the sliding doors just fell out and became useless.So the store i bought it from gladly exchanged it, but the next one was split and busted on the roof on the house. I went to exchange it again and the third house had splits all around the sides. I decided to end my love for the contemporary dollhouse."
3,"beautiful, but bad quality","i love the way this dollhouse looks in photos, but the quality is a huge disappointment. i have had 3 of these in my possession and each has been seriously flawed, i returned the first two, and finally gave up and settled on the third. the top of the first house was so warped that it could not be attached to the base at all. the second one had chips and cracks that were just painted over in the factory, and the third one...well the paint job is a mess and the top does not fit properly and the sliding walls just fall out and had to be removed. I have a lot of plan toys and apart from this piece i have found the quality to be perfect, i guess there is just no quality control on the line for this one, such a shame."
4,Tasty vegetarian alternative for those love love meat,I really love this soup mix. I am such a carnivore that I feel like something is missing without meat at every meal. This soup mix satisfies my protein cravings when I make it for lunch. It goes really well with cornbread muffins.
3,Dr. Who Black Orchid,"Doctor Who - Black Orchid (Episode 121)Typical Dr. Who from Peter Davison. The shortest episode that I can think of. As usual, well acted and very good location."
3,Not an expert on past Doctors,"I have just started to explore past versions of the show. So I am no expert. I did not particularly like this actor playing the Doctor, he was just fair in my view. The story line was good. Maybe having watched the new series for its 4 year run, I am too critical of past versions. TV was very different then. It holds up well enough to enjoy, but not well enough to give it a high mark."
2,Don't hold your breath...,"These seat covers were ordered OVER a month ago, and it was mentioned that it would take two weeks to ship. Now I see on my delivery estimate it will be another two weeks which translates into 6 weeks. They were to be a gift... oh well, hard to review something you can't see."
1,the worst book ever,"This book is the worst Spanish text I have had to use. It is poorly organized and offers little in terms of support materials. If you have a choice, pick En Español."
4,Good reference tool to have,"This book has synonyms and antonyms in Spanish for Spanish words.-Good reference tool for Spanish synonyms and antonyms for a lot of words, but not all the words which would have it's limits."
2,Disappointment,What was I thinking? This little LAROUSSE DICCIONARIO DE SINONIMOS is too limited to be of use to a translator or writer.
2,no me gusto mucho,Tiene muchos sinónimos pero no explica las difencias de significado de los sinónimos.
5,very good,gives you better take off and way more power. that is if u have v8 or biger engine. great for ford mustand jeeps gmc big boys
4,"Great book, needs to be longer",This is a fantastic record keeping journal. It makes all of the record keeping so easy! The only thing that i feel is wrong with it is that there are not enough daily pages so you have to end up buying a new journal after about a month.
4,Terrific tool for the harried parents of a newborn.,"This book turned out to be very handy when I had my twins! My girls were on different schedules and I was so exhausted I couldn't remember who had eaten or slept. I started keeping notes so I could see if there were any patterns, and work towards getting them on the same nap schedule. The only downside is that it is designed for one baby, so I had to find a way to notate both babies on one page. I went through two copies which now serve as a reminder that yes, it really was as nutty as I remembered! I have since given this as a gift. What's more you can often find it here on Amazon at a very good price."
3,average product,"Nice design, easy to install, stayed in place pretty well (06 Scion xA).I am replacing my pair after 5 years; by now the colors are dramatically sun-faded and the foam padding has become brittle, not to mention accumulation of stains and the like. Since the whole point is to protect the car seat, I'd say they've performed their job well by taking the abuse.The primary drawback is the mesh surface which accumulates crumbs and whatnot.REVISION - I have lowered my rating after removing the seat covers. The inside foam padding had completely eroded in many spots, leaving a tremendous amount of thick, hard-to-remove dust not only on but IN the seat, to the point of discoloration."
3,A nice stocking stuffer or secret santa gift,"This little book would make a nice ""gesture"" or ""token"" gift. Not that it is at all bad, it's not! It's quite nice. It is set up much like a personal affirmation book. Lots of white space with a brief few sentences on the right side pleasantly outlining a simple task that once completed will make you a more proficient and happy artist. Not a book to buy if you are hell-bent on learning the actual business side of fine art."
2,187 Tips for Artists,"If you are looking for insight on how to build your business, this is not the right book. It may be useful for young people or emerging artists. Many of the tips are related to life skills. The tips are presented simplisticly. They are not particularly helpful for artists already in the marketplace."
5,Specific ideas to focus work and marketing plan,"I received this book as gift and find myself returning to it again and again. It has helped me tremendously in keeping my marketing plan focused and in using my time much more efficiently. Perfect for the creative, but maybe not so organized type."
4,This book should create earthquakes,"As heartbreaking as it is eye-opening, this is an account of trying to conceptually reinsert humans into nature as much as it is the story of remarkable apes. Savage-Rumbaugh convincingly presents not only the bonobo Kanzi, but also his sister Panbanisha and the common chimpanzees Sherman and Austin, as persons in every sense but the arbitrary one of species. Tragically, the author provides a sense of the rich life our cousins lead beneath our noses at the precise moment any opportunity to know these people called apes in their own milieus is being exterminated. Read the book and pass it on."
2,Big Disappointment,This book was disappointing -- really didn't live up to its title. A rather boring read for such a potentially interesting subject.
3,Palladio synosis,"This is a small paperback, which reviews Palladio's life and work. I have other more extensive and better illustrated works, but this is adequate for an introduction to his work"
1,A real Fireball alright,"I bough this as a quick, cheap upgrade in my Helion Dominus 4x4. The ESC is good to 15T motors. I broke in the motor with the water break in and the motor was filthy, totally nasty. The motor ran, when properly geared down to a 12T pinion, for about 4 minutes before literally melting. While it was running the truck was considerably faster. The ESC caught on fire in the truck and partially melted the body on my truck. I replaced the ESC with a Duratrax 12T modified ESC and tried a new one, it worked for about 6 minutes and the motor again failed. Do not buy this motor."
5,Best Show on TV,"Rescue Me does it again in Season 3 as the best show on TV. Denis Leary is the best actor/writer combo around. There is comedy, drama, action, controversial issues, happy endings, you name it and Rescue Me will deliver. A fantastic buy for any adult TV fan."
5,Great show,"Love this show, wish I would have watched it when it was on. Glad I finally got a chance to watch it. Denis Leary is awesome."
5,Best Show,"Rescue Me has to have been the best show on tv. Following the lives of fire fighters in their ""house"" it always touched your emotions. It shocked you, made you laugh out loud, brought tears to your eyes, an all in the same episode! Excellent scripts, actors and production values. Cannot praise it highly enough. Thanks, all involved in Rescue Me."
4,This a fun show.,I've been a fan of this show since it first came on. I can't tell if they've junped the shark yet because they keep throwing curves in the plot. The characters have great dialog in the firehouse and that will keep you laughing.
4,Love this show,I love this show. But season 3 and 4 have still not been released in Europe. And it doesn't look likely this will happen any time soon. So when I read somewhere online reviews that this R1 dvd does play in R2 players I was so happy. The good news is ... it does. The bad news (for my deaf husband) is that there are no subtitles even though it says so in the description of the dvd. I was very pleased with the way Amazon handled it. But sad that I can not watch the show with my husband. Hopefully it will become available with subtitles soon. I adore the show! I love Dennis! One of the best shows around.
1,Rescue Me - The Complete Third Season,"I was really looking forward to watch these series, but after few first episodes in the first season I lost interest, its too strange for me, and I am somehow dissappointed in the quality of the pictures and they don't have subtitles not even closed captions.... :(I understand english, but I miss subtitle/closed caption option."
3,"One of the best tv shows ever, but ...","... there are definitely no subtitles available (though Amazon listed them)!!! Only Closed Captioned (CC), but I cannot play! Thanks a lot to Sony!The first and second season of this show are great, interesting storylines, brilliant actors, wonderfull images of the city and good music. So the show would be worth at least 5 stars, because of the ignorance of Sony concerning the subtitles it will be a total of 3 stars."
3,Just Okay,"bought this for my 3 yo son. Came with 4 putters, 4 colored tennis balls and 4 velcro stikums with flags. The grips of the putters are rubber sleeves that can slip off a little too easily. I thought it would be enough to keep him away from my golf clubs, but he still seems to prefer playing with my clubs rather than these."
3,Cards pictured are in the minority...,"If you are looking for a deck based on the artwork of Francine Hart, this would not be it. The cards pictured on the cover are in the minority - the majority are pen-and-ink drawings (and not very impressive ones) of shapes pertaining to sacred geometry - circles laid out in certain patterns, etc.The accompanying book is a ""regular"" tarot guide: ""This card in an upright position means X, reversed it means Y.""As a basic tarot, based on sacred geometry shapes, it fulfills the requirements.As a tool for personal interpretation and introspection, triggered by the incredible artwork of Francine Hart and based on *her* interpretation of sacred geometry, it falls far short. I will be returning mine. If you are looking for images of her artwork, better to buy greeting cards from her site."
5,charlies angels,"I love Charlies Angels,esp. when CherylLaddjoined the show. I guess that is why I bought seasons 2&3 first. she is hot!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Okay,"The third season of Charlie's Angels picks up where the second one left off, only with better writing. Cheryl Ladd hits a better stride and the guest spots by Farrah are definitely high points of the season."
3,It was dying!!! Enough of those Sabrina turtle necks!!!,"By season three, ABC (""Charlie's Angels"" network) was in distress. The series was still ranking in 12th place with a 24.4 rating, but the series was seriously dying. Hello, look at the fan clubs: Farrah Fawcett, Jaclyn Smith, and even season two starter, Cheryl Ladd, outpolled Kate Jackson in popularity. I also think that season three was the show's worst year. Silly and confusing episodes made me turn by TV off. However, the episodes with the return of Farrah are very enjoyable. You might like this, you might not, you choice, give it a chance. Maybe?"
5,Charlie's Angels - The Complete Third Season,"Great TV series, I was a great fan of the Angels, wouldn't miss it. I love the Packaging system used. The DVD's are packed in excellent conditions. I have seen the complete third season and would watch it over and over again."
3,Edited versions!,"It's great to see this classic, campy series on DVD, but why oh why did Sony choose to use the edited versions of these episodes? It's been 18 years since some of these episodes first aired, but I remember the unedited versions of some of these episodes. It's a shame that these transfers, which are about as clear as could be reasonably made, are of edited versions of the episodes. A 4-star set, minus 1 star for the modified episodes."
5,Charlie's most heavenly Angels together!,"This is a very special season for me, specially because my favorite Angel Farrah Fawcett is back for a few special guest star episodes and this is the last season for the wonderful Kate Jackson. All them are lovely, it is nice to see how Farrah and Cheryl Ladd work so well together, and is always a pleasure to watch the beautiful Jaclyn Smith! The episodes are mostly enjoyable, although first season is still my favorite. Can't wait to have seasons 4 and 5! It is a nonsense not to release the other seasons! We want Shelley Hack and Tanya Roberts NOW!, please :-)"
4,"Charlie's Angels, the Third Season","Excellent series, actually enjoyed it more than the second season"
5,EARLY BE BOP AT ITS BEST,"originaly released as keynote 78 rpm records.than later the LP record was called THE YOUNG AT BOP on EMARCY MERCURY MG 26001 Dave Lambert,Buddy Stewart,Red Rodney,Neal Hefti and his ALL STARS and they all are...all songs are great bop from 1946.you can't go wrong with this CD.hard to get as it also was sold as a multi disc set from 1987.wish they would reissue it."
5,"A thrilling sequal to ""Last Wish""-full of shocks & surprises","""Aftershock"" is one of the best SVH books yet! The book is full of suspense and excitement- a have-to-read book for all Sweet Valley fans."
2,Something is definitely wrong.,"This book was pretty touching and everything, but it just wasn't incredible. The weirdest thing is that Olivia Davidson died in this book, but in Sweet Valley University number 8 [Home for Christmas], Liz and Jessica go to a high school reunion and she's there! So even though she supposedly dies, she'll still alive two years later. How did that happen?"
4,sad but good,"Olivias death was very sad and touching..I mean Olivia was in Sweet Valley Twins and everything! Amazing!-I dont recall Olivia being in SVU no 8,which title was that? I think Francine Pascal should join the wwriting team on DaysofourLives...ha ha ha heh..."
5,IS OLIVIA BACK FROM THE DEAD?,"I haven't read this book yet (though I've read Earthquake) but I have just one thing to say: WHAT IS THIS ABOUT OLIVIA BEING ALIVE IN SVU? That was about the first thing I noticed when I read the synopsis for this book. HOW CAN SHE STILL BE ALIVE IN SVU? It's impossible, and I think I may e-mail Francine Pascal and find out why that happened! I completly agree with the other reviewer! WIERD!!"
1,Didn't last long,The ratchet broke with my wife using it to break loose a torx screw. Not a quality ratchet in the kit.
3,ratcheting,My husband uses it a lot. Has only one bad thing to say aboutit is that the lock that hold the elbow in place disengages in themiddle of the product
4,Good Buy,This is a great product- I gave it to my fiance as a gift and his only complaint is that the driver heads are not magnetic. Other than that it is easy to use and works well for a variety of projects.
1,Broke before I used it!!,"It was broken in the box. The screwdriver only operates in one direction.Which is fine, unless you want to use it!<sic>My second bad experience with Allied.... Do me wrong once shame on you, Do me wrong twice shame on me....WONT BE A THIRD TIME ...."
2,Could be better...,"This is definitely a step down from their first album, and far worse than anything the Jazz June ever did. It is indeed listenable, and a couple tracks are decent, but overall this album is not very coherent and sounds like it was thrown together without a lot of thought."
4,Great documentary and CD for the price,"This is DVD has a great documentary, very enjoyable to see, can be bought at a bargain price. It is true that some information should be on the box, shame on BMG classics, as the other reviewer says, but I find this a great deal as I loved the documentary. And the extra movie with Caruso in it playing two roles is great too!."
4,Derrida -- Deconstructing via Cartoons!,"This attempt to explain Derrida's major theoreticalpositions via simple language and cartoon/comicrelief is admirable; however, despite the welcomehumor regarding a rather daunting subject, thereis a certain lack of ""meat"" for the philosophystudent to chew on. Great for a non-specialistintroduction to Derrida, but as an ""introduction,""it seems to leave me knowing Derrida's name(and his face contorted various ways), but withouta load of details to remember him by"
5,Only Book on Deconstruction That Has Made Sense to Me,I think deconstruction is important but have difficulty understanding it. This book is the only lucid explanation I've seen of it's basic principles.
5,very helpful,"If you are beginning to read derrida, this book will be very helpful. Now if they only made one for Judith Butler! (Skip the Foucault, his theories are not that complex.)"
5,WOW! Jewel is VERY talanted!,"I have like her in the past but till I got this concert I did not relize just how wonderfull her talent realy is. I came away with even mor respect and of corse a very enjoyable time watching the concert.I like that she chats with the audence from time to time, You can relate to her and get the sence that she is a very down to earth person! I like the 2nd disk concert just a bit more then disk 1 concert. The songs are the same or nearly the same but I just got a sence she was more comfortable at the 2nd disk concert This as become one of my favoret Bue-ray concerts to watch over again. I don't see how you could be disapointed with this. SEE MY VIDEO REVIEW IN YOU TUB. PUT IN YOU TUB SEARCH MrWm2800 and you will see this as well as several other concert dvd reviews."
4,blast from the past,jps is so underated and bleeding star is their finest effort....out of all the matador bands to make some noise they are the best but didn't make so much as a pop...anway...but this album right now
4,The best of psychedlia!,"Combining the best of shoe gazers, psychedelia and the melodies of Tommy James. If you stumbled on this you are lucky."
5,Pure Gundam pleasure!,"Everyone who purchases a Gundam kit knows you're taking a chance with missing parts and such but this kit had everything including the parts not to be used in construction. On top of that, out came a full two days before the scheduled arrival date! It should also be noted that this is not a toy! This is a model kit similar to airplane and car kits made by companies such as Revell & Tamiya. This kit will not stand up to the abuse of most 2-12 yr olds.The kit looks great. I haven't put it together yet so I can't comment on assembly.I would definitely recommend this buy though!5 *****'s for sure!!!!"
5,Very Nice Gundam!,"This model I would say tops all of my Gundam 1/100 kits (so far).Lots of fun building the kit and for the price, it's worth it.Highly recommended!"
2,Just didn't care about the characters,I found this a very boring book and 3/4 through I just quit. I just could not justify wasting my time. I am in my 30's so maybe I just can't relate.
3,"Hawkwind - 'Spirit Of The Age,Part 1' (Voiceprint) CD single","Another current CD single to accompany their latest release 'Take Me To Your Leader'(see my review).This single has three cuts,with once again guest Mathew Wright on vocals to ""Angela Android""(it's strange not hearing Lene Lovich)and the Bob Calvert classic Middle Eastern themed ""Assassins Of Allah"",both which were recorded live.Plus there's a radio friendly edit of ""Spirit Of The Age"".Like the CD single 'Spirit Of The Age,Part 2'(see my review),the music here is good,but if IT were me putting these two CD singles out,I'd have combined the two.Don't get me wrong,for Hawkwind still rules!"
3,Kind of interesting...,"This CD is basically a couple of versions, all similar to eachother, of the classic Hawkwind song ""Spirit of the Age"" with some dance/techno beats and some modern spacey synths thrown in. Robert Calvert's original vocal track remains. I view this CD as a respectful tribute to one of the deceased Calvert's greatest works, and as such I enjoy it. If you don't own the original version of Spirit of the Age, buy that first. If you like it, buy this later."
3,Seems a little small for the price,"I haven't given this toy to my son yet, as I purchased it for his birthday next month. I just received it and it seems really small for the money it costs. It is very heavy and seems nicely crafted, but like I said, only about twice as big as a matchbox car."
3,realistic portrayal of suffering and the struggle out of it,excellent actingcharacters felt realrealistic portrayal of suffering and the struggle out of itwould have liked a bit more of the back story
1,So slow,As much as I like josh Lucas this film was slow and anti climactic. I'm surprised he agreed to a script like this.
2,unfulfilled,"Cut-up, comical sound effects produced by someone with zero time in the environment they tried to portray.The film was well acted & filmed but very hard to follow. I felt misled by the trailer and was very disappointed with this film."
2,4 stars for the acting,I give this move 2 stars ( ** ) Well acted but very disappointing as entertainment.Josh Lucas's performance is truly outstanding and the supporting cast was awesome.But it just didn't hit the mark.
3,A Good Independent Film,"A grieving businessman (Josh Lucas) buys a sailboat 'as is' and fixing the boat is like therapy. He wasn't just grieving,though, he was punishing himself. I needed to know exactly what happened in this man's life and waiting for the answer is what kept me watching.One word came to mind when the movie was over - profound."
3,"""Homestyle""","Don't buy this book if you expect to make anything that you would see on a standard Japanese table. I was given it after I expressed a desire to make some of the foods I'd learned to love living in Japan and was sorely disapointed. The pictures are lovely, however, and if you are just going for intresting dishes its not that bad. Its a lovely thing to page through to work up an appatite."
4,"Very good, but too tool specific","What some people fail to realize, including apparently the author, is that you can substitute tools that you have for those required for preparation, even is that process is specialized like making square eggs. You only really need a small all-purpose knife, a serrated knife, a square baking tray (for the omelettes), a wok, two pots of different size for cooking soup and/or noodles, a pan, a cutting/rolling board, and a strainer. For steaming, simply put the foods into the strainer, and let the steam pass through.Buying exotic tools doesn't work, as you can do the same with those you have once you know how to use them for this purpose, whereas odd tools you will only use once if you do not feel comfortable with them."
2,DESTINED TO BECOME INVISIBLE ON YOUR FAVORITE LIST,"The ""menace and out-and-out horror"" promised by Universal are invisible in this rather lukewarm installment in the ""IM"" series. Star Jon Hall is pretty to look at, and he might even be a good thespian, though the script (and Ford Bebbe's clumsy direction) certainly don't give him any chance to prove it. The plot is as vapid as it is improbable (and confusing): A man named Robert Griffin stows away on a ship, returning to England to get the money owed to him by his ""business partners,"" who happened to be Mr. and Mrs. We end up with bad guy versus badder guy and gal ... with lots of plot manipulations and oversized hypodermic needles thrown in. What makes the film worth watching (once) are the (limited) special effects; most specially the scene in which Griffin reveals his invisible eyes and the nifty bit in which he splatters flour on his face to prove his identity to a friend. This Wells have run dry."
3,NOT WHAT I THOUGHT IT TO BE,"Ok im a big fan of EVELYN ANKERS.So I bought this movie because of her.But she was only in about 5 scenes.Also this movie should be called DEBT OF THE INVISIBLE MAN.Its about a family who owesRobert Griffen money.Im not trying to ruin AMAZONS career ,but its not a very good movie."
4,INFERIOR UNRELATED SEQUEL TO THE FIRST TWO FILMS! STILL ENTERTAINS! 3 1/2 STARS!,"This is the final in the Invisible Man series of 3 films. By 1944 most of the Universal Monsters films were getting made on a very small budget and this last installment of the Invisible Man shows the same signs as the others, although not as bad. It's still a very entertaining film just a bit too contrived to take too seriously. The FX are pretty good but, most of the FX are parlor tricks and there are some wires showing here and there. It's a lot of fun and by this time in the series it's OK to laugh. This is available on DVD as part of the Invisible Man Legacy Collection along with 4 other films relating to invisibility. The DVD transfer is very good and there are some interesting extras included."
2,Not a bad B film but some editing would have made it tauter,"Hall plays a homicidal paranoic who thinks (unjustly) that he has been swindled out of great wealth. After learning some tricks about invisibility from crackpot scientist John Carradine, he goes on a rampage against his would-be persecuters. Not a bad little horror film but too much footage is given Leon Errol, the film's comic relief. The end result is a thriller that could have been tighter with less padding. 2 1/2 stars."
3,My 2nd Favorite Invisible Man Movie!,"Okay, technically, my 2nd favorite Invisible Man movie is ""The Invisible Woman"", but that's a comedy.""Revenge"" is actually the only one of the ""Invisible Man"" sequels in which the Invisible Man is a true menace like he was in the Claude Rains original.The plot doesn't make much sense, and Jon Hall is no Claude Raines or Vincent Price, but don't let any of that throw you. Enjoy his wreaking vengeance on those whom he accuses of wronging him, and the clever and innovative photographic tricks. This Invisible Man is seen with water on his face 56 years before ""Hollow Man!"""
4,Classic,"What else can be said? Remade and butchered, this classic mixes and interesting concept and plot with the campy B effect every sci-fier and monster movie fan would enjoy. 4 stars because it is a little bit slow to get going, but otherwise great."
2,cheap,"the fabric is not sturdy and after a few uses the strap broke and the fabric tore. My son is a consummate musician and this bag was an awful purchase, I will look for a better product for him to carry his sax. Huge disappointment"
4,Great brakes... Wear easily,"I like these brakes for their sole purpose, braking! These will stop my cannondale with ease (especially on the front so i sometimes find myself doing stoppies). These pads definitely wear on the front more than the back (There is a toe-in adjustment but by the time i found it my brakes were worn down). I have a silver pair on the front and a black pair on the back (long story). I reccomend these brakes very much.- 4 Stars - Excelllent Braking - Wear unevenly - Please rate as helpful"
5,Great so far,"Just installed last week, so they're still getting broken in, but so far, the pads are quiet, grippy (only installed a pair on my rear brakes so far), and smooooooth. Definitely a huge improvement over the (potentially original) old Dia-compe pads on my cantis. Look a lot nicer too! Made sure to thoroughly clean off the rim before using the new ones, as advised by other reviewers and the product packaging.To follow up after additional use. They can squeal sometimes, if you have to brake for an extended time like on a steep downhill. And when they do, they squeal REAL loudly. Pedestrians definitely know you're coming. For now I just have a pair on my rear brakes, so it's not a big deal as they don't get used much, but I could see it potentially being annoying if I had them on the front. But I haven't tried anything to make them quit squealing either, since it's pretty infrequent."
1,Deceptive price range,"Why are they saying that the price ranges from 4.95 to up? This is a very dirty marketing strategy.I don't plan to buy anything from them, i don't wanna support this kind of companies."
2,There's got to be a content checker...,"Apparently Tansley failed to re-read his book before getting it published and failed to come up with a revised edition. Some of the examples are inconsistent with what he described before hand. Letters missing, wrong punctuation, wrong characters. You have to double check online some of the stuff he has in the book just to be sure he got it right.Don't buy it if you don't have to. There's probably better books out there on this subject."
2,"Typos, typos",The first few pages of this book that I have read so far are full of typos. How can one believe that what one is reading will work when the text itself has not been verified?The examples are poorly presented for readability. One does not know where the target ends and the source begins because there are no spaces.Once I have had a chance to look at the content I may revise my review upwards but so far I am unimpressed.
3,Complete Hymn of the Nations,"I have read that the film was edited in the 1950s to remove the Russian hymn, but a complete version was issued on VHS by the Library of Congress in 1988. RCA goofed, but a government agency did better despite the craziness of the 1950s."
1,The cut spoils this,"As one other review notes, the performance of patriotism in the Hymn of the Nations is reminiscent of the Marseillaise scene in the film Casablanca (also made in 1943, at the height of World War II)--except in Verdi's piece the national anthems of England, Italy, and France are put together contrapuntally, while in Casablanca the French national anthem is combined somewhat harmonically with a German militaristic song (also the tune of the Yale alma mater, by the way).Other reviews mention the omission of the Internationale. The cut is so amateurish that you'll notice it even if you've never heard the Hymn of the Nations. I wanted this recording for its historical interest and its artistic quality (granting that the Hymn is a potboiler and the recording quality is archaic). Since the cut ruins the film in both respects, I can't recommend this DVD. Whoever censored the film would make a good functionary in one of the countries where the Internationale found favor."
5,Good enough,"I read all three books and enjoyed them all a lot, I loved all the time hoping fun! But it also wasn't the best that ive read. But still you should definitely read this if your any fan at all!"
3,okay novel,"While this book is by far better than the next two, I still found it left much to be desired. The dialogue wasn't that great, the plot was cliched, and there were lots of fights... they're required, of course, but not that many. Fights don't work as well in novel form as they do in comic form."
4,"Ok plot, but not so great dialouge","Okay, the premise of the book was good, the whole time travel thing that DeFalco had going, but the dialouge between the characters left alot to be desired. But besides this, it was a rather enjoyable read."
3,Fair,"When you actually read the book, it's not as good as you think it'll be. Half the book is trying to understand a machine that if one has seen the 'toon or the comics they already understand. Could have been better.One actual good thing, IMO was the cliff-hanger in the end. I won't say what it was so as not to spoil it for others."
3,i've read better,"the first part of this trilogy was okay...i mean it was enjoyable, but it just didn't quite match up to Golden's trilogy...well, i have the other two books in my room, maybe it'll get better."
4,"It only lacks good color photos, the rest is very good","This little book is quite good, there are not many books on german armored cars, and this one is very good and quite detailed, the diagrams abot the suspension, drive system ang guns are absolutely awesome,if you like to build scale models of the 234 series like the ones by Dragon you should get it, recommended."
3,German armoured cars,"This book has a good bit of historical information, and some very good in action shots.It does have a few interior pictures, but not much.It does include a very good unit makings guide.I have used this book in my model building, but, due to the lack of good, detailed interior pictures, I don`t know that I would buy it again.If you can get it a a GOOD price overall, then it would not be a bad book to have."
5,Good book for the interested model builder,"This book and this series for that matter, is wonderful for the scale model builder or wargamer who is interested in German military vehicles of WWII. This book focuses on the 8 wheeled variant armored cars used by the German Military with great success during WWII. It gives an excellent vehicle/design history, info on tactics, lots of specific mechanical details, tons of images including actual photos, period diagrams, even a section on unit markings. It would be an excellent resource for any scale model builder who is building a ""Puma"" or other sdkfz 231/234 vehicle. This is just an all around good book from a very useful series of books."
3,Canted Antiferromagnetisim- A Good Beginners Guide,"Dispite a slight lack of truly in-depth research into the many different parts of antiferromagnetisim, this guide is a great way to enter the arena of magnetic healing and mineral-guided meditation. The powers of the hemetite are thourghly discused at length, along with the other preferred meditation ""soulstones"" and the moonstone paralex relationship. However, if you are seriously interested in a complete and non watered-down Encylcopeda Antiferromagneta, I would presue Dr. Y Kiplink's book, ""The Advanced Use of Metals and Gems"", or Lan Manderdagon's, ""The Soul and the Stone"". The true meaning of these works, however, is well complented with ""Canted Antiferromagnetisim"" as a novice's basic guide with Kiplink and Mangerdagon as encylcopedia-like index or advanced instrution ""respectfully."
4,"Small, but works","Fills up quickly, but works as advertised. Definitely better than having to rake up clippings afterwards."
3,Works OK - needs product tuning for B&D.,"This is my second bag in as little as 2 years. The placement of the arm and the hole it goes into on the B&D; Electric Mower need refinement by B&D.; The bag drags too easily after filling half-way and the cloth rips up creating an unfix-able hole.The grass clippings go all the way into the bag which is great, I just wish they had a better framework figured out."
2,"Zipper, Stripper","The B&D mower works. It was my first electric. Mulches well and picks up well, but be patient with it. I'd done yard work (125 of them)in LA. I was ready to get away from the gas and oil changes. The BAG packs in the leaves, BUT The Zipper broke quickly. It was OK since one side still opened. ALSO, The hanger rod easily stripped the soft plastic mower body. This is it's 3rd summer on a small suburban yard. Problem: Leaf raking time in Philadelphia and I lost the hanger bar! Do I buy a whole new overpriced kit? No-one sells the rod alone. Call me frustrated."
1,This pooly designed grass catcher is an afterthought,"All the criticisms I've read on Amazon about this product are on the mark. The thing is poorly designed and catches on everything while you mow because it sticks out too far on one side. Also, the bag tears easily when brushing up against things in the yard not to mention the nylon zipper which must be unzipped and zipped each time the (small) catcher is emptied. A waste of your money and time."
3,Could be better with just a little effort,"I purchased this for my Black and Decker electric lawnmower. It easily snaps into place, and it is easy to remove and empty. so far, so good right?the problem is that the lower front corner of this bag actually drags on the grass while I'm cutting the lawn. This isn't a problem for the grass, but after a year of use it has worn away the fabric at this point, and the bag has a hole in it there now.I've ""patched"" the hole by sewing on a piece of tin flashing that I cut to shape and punched holes in. I used some polymer cord as my thread and a leather sewing awl as my needle.Black and Decker could make this an outstanding product by adding a piece of high density plastic on this spot, to prevent future holes."
3,Better than not having it!!,"This unit still lets much of the finer grass clippings out through the 'cracks' but, all in all, it is much better than not having it. The capacity is somewhat low but, again, it's better to make a couple extra trips to the trash can to empty it instead of having to rake the lawn later."
5,Better Design,"Material used is much better than the older cloth baggers. I would only make one improvement if I was ""king"" for a day. That would be to install a piece of clear material on the bag to better gauge when you need to empty it. Other than that, I am very pleased with it."
1,Whoever designed this should be fired!,"There's a reason you don't see a picture of the bagger and the mower together...if you did you wouldn't buy the bag! The bag is so small and hangs off the right side of the mower, rather than behind. I have to empty 5-7 times during the course of mowing my small lawn (less than 1000 sqft). Not only is it small but when it starts getting full it pulls the mower off balance, making it hard to turn as well as reducing the power of the mower's blades by getting clogged with grass. What's worse is that it hangs off the right side suspended with a pole like a canvas windsock. It hangs out so far that the mower doesn't fit through doors or gates. Also the bag gets in the way anytime you're trying to mow and have to maneuver around objects on your right like plants or trees.If I had known how small this bagger was and how ofter I'd be emptying its contents, I would have never bought it. I only wish B&D; made a rear bagger for the mower (which I like)."
3,Good for the money.,"Bag is working ok except on hills it seems to come of easily, and since it's relatively small, I have to empty it several times to mow my front yard. But other than that it works very well."
4,Lawn Mower Bag Replacement,It's hard to get excited about a lawnmower bag. Buying it was easy and I got exactly what I ordered. I believe the bag design could be better. The internal metal stiffner on the top rear of the bag protruds and thus frequently catches the electric cord so it wears here quicker and I had to replace the original one becasue the zippers finally gave out.
3,side bag pro's and con's,"this was a much needed item for me. however, there are some problems. first (no particular order of importance....they all are), the way it hangs from the bar, causes it to hit a lot of things while trying to mow. next, the way the bag bends right near the hard plastic connection piece, it causes the bag to clog quickly, so you have to empty it many times, even for a yard like mine which isn't huge. the fact that the cover has to be lifted to attach the bag, then there is no way for it to go down when the bag is on, doesn't help the matter, either. I needed a small mower, which is why I got this one, but I think they could have done a better design for a bag you have to buy extra. a good thing is that you know once it's clogged, as it starts to leave a trail of grass that doesn't go in the bag. Don't wait for the bag itself to feel full because it will never happen, and grass cuttings will be all over the lawn."
2,Again with the zipper problem,The bag is okay. Don't have too big a problem with the size and all but one major problem is the lousy zipper. Read lots of problems about them and I had one too the first month or so. The other worked but now I have problems with that one as well. I cannot zipper it all the way or the one functioning zipper comes off so I have to keep it open slightly and get pelted with cut grass till the whole plugs up.The other problem is that it does not hook on so well so if you lightly bump into something the bag falls off...not major but a pain in the neck.
2,zipper failure,"Con:I purchased this bag, along with a lawn mower, two seasons ago. The inboard zipper pulled past its ""limit point"", and would not re-link, after only one season. This third season looks to be the last legs for the other zipper, as I have been careful to the point of nuisance, in trying to prevent the seconds' failure.The spreader/support bar, inside the bag, is also beginning to show through.The stand-off bar post will strip its plastic hold with a small amount of pressure, so mowing close to any object on your right will require pulling the mower backwards from the left.Pro:It is very easy to get on and off, and only emptying twice on a 5000+ sq. ft. yard in a Cleveburg, OH suburb."
1,SIZE MATTERS,"It's true that it fits the mower, however, it fills up in 2 min. so.. it's useless.Sorry, don't buy it."
2,Mower bag,"This was a replacement bag. It has ripped in the same area as the first one, making it un-useable. Not happy!"
5,grass catcher,"I have had the lawn hog mower for about five years with the original grass bag I bought with it, and so far have not had any problems with either. I only bought another bag because I feel like the mower will last for another ten years and if I need another bag in the furure they might be hard to get. So I bought this spare to put away for the future. After 5 years of use the bag has no holes and the zipper has no problems at all, and I use it weekly all summer every summer. I am very happy with this product."
4,Black & Decker Lawnmower/mulcher Bag review,The mower has been real good. It has lasted 7 years and still going strong. The bag was not as hardy. The bag is OK - but the zipper has a problem. Keeps wanting to mis-zip (if that is a word). But the treds of the zipper mismatch and it leaves an opening.The new one that I just got seemed much better - sturdier than the original. But - even if it only lasts 7 years - it is still a pretty good buy.
1,Disappointed,"The Black and Decker side bag did not fit on my electric lawn mower. Called B&D and took it to an authorized dealer and bag could not be attached. Therefore, returned product. Was satisfied with return process. Thank you Amazon."
2,"Too small, poorly supported","The zippers and grab loops are well placed and seem to be well designed, but the capacity is quite limited. The biggest problem is with the metal rod that the bag hangs on. The rod fits into a hole in the mower body, and the assembly depends on a small tab at the end of the rod fitting into a slot in the hole to keep it from flopping around. Because the mower body is plastic and the metal tab is very small, the weight of the grass caused the metal tab to wear the plastic slot after just one use, resulting in the bag flopping around and sometimes falling off."
4,cleaner easier grass cutting,"when we bought the mower there was no bag included (we bought the mower at a yard sale) but we figured that there was no real need. After a couple months of mowing and hassling with the cuttings being raked by hand the wife and I decided it was time to find and price the ""optional"" bag. We found it and and were satisfied with the price and shipping so we bought it. It arrived and we have been very happy with the addition of the bag and the ease of using it. We live in AZ and so we have small areas of grass and for us this works fine but if you have large areas to mow you might have to empty the bag a couple times but should still be a help overall versus raking. We only gave it a 4 star since it is a little small but to be honest I don't know that the bag could have been made any larger but we are happy with it overall."
3,"The mower is great, this is... not so great","It works. It's ""ok"". The design allows you to hold/carry/unzip the bag and empty it into a bin with ease. However,1) It's sort of small.2) The metal rod that is supposed to NOT turn is held in place by a small nub of plastic in the lawnmower body that immediately gets rounded out and starts turning freely (not a big deal)3) Occasionally, when mowing on a curve, if nearly full, it detaches from the mower on its own. It might be nice to have a slightly better locking mechanism.Meh. You gotta get one unless you have some other solution for the debris on your lawn. And if you do, let me know."
3,Useful attachment,"The bag works, but the problem is the way it attach to the mower on the side, a little cunbersome, and also it makes the hole thing twice as wide, making it impossible to work the machine in tigh spaces."
3,Black & Decker Side Bag,"Works well. Only drawback is that it's small. You will have to dump it many times, even for a small yard. Zipper gets caught quite easily."
1,Zipper fell apart after only a couple months.,The bag worked decently with the noted problems but the zipper fell apart after only 3 or so months and I'm not mowing very much lawn or mowing it very often. Boooo!
2,Handy but of low quality,"I bought this bag 5 months ago and was very happy with it until a month later when one of the side zippers broke. I had used it 2 or 3 times, opening and closing the zipper 3-4 times on each occasion. Since the other side's zipper eas still working, I didn't bother to change or replace it. However, last weekend the other zipper broke as well. I have now written to Amazon and hopefully they (or B&D;) will replace it.It is otherwise quite sufficient for my backyard and is very handy, easy to put up and clean."
2,this product is chintzy,this product is overpriced. it certainly doesn't contain $40 of technology. the bag is made from cheap material. i'm on my third. the first one wore out because the zippers broke. the 2nd one had a hole in it where a metal piece rubs against it. amazon promptly replaced it - thanks. i wish there were alternatives for this product or that it was priced lower. and that you could replace just the canvas bag and not the hole thing.
2,Mismatched components in box,"The support rod I received is 6"" too long for the bag, or else the bag I received is 6"" too short for the rod. The box may have been opened and re-taped. I had to tie the bag to the rod with a piece of wire. I won't be using the bag that often so it's not that big a deal, but it's disappointing. Other than that the bag works fine. As others have said, it's a bit smaller than most grass bags."
2,Review of B&D side bag assembly,Black & Decker Side Bag Assembly #BA-075We were so happy to find this product for our mower. We find that the bag so not stay on the mower and we are going to have to engineer a way for it to stay on. It just falls off (from the mower and from the hook).
3,OK product,I used this side bag but it's hard to handle the mower when the bag is coming full because it's on the side. I would recommend the rear bag.
2,Better Without,"Thought having this would help. Didn't. Grass would clog at the opening of the bag which of course caused the mower to slow or stop with grass clogged in it. In the end it's just easier to rake up after mowing. Also, if it did go into the bag, the bag doesn't hold very much."
2,Does not last,"I seldom used this when mowing my small lawn, but even so, the hole in the mower's plastic deck that holds the metal rod that in turn holds the bag up wore out, so the rod would not keep the bag up any more."
4,It would be nice if it is a little bit bigger...,"It is fairly easy to put it on, and verything works so far. But the bag is on the small side..."
2,Delenda,"This album is good, but did not give me that warm fuzzy feeling like the first one. I think the new singer does the job. He has a harsh scream that blends with the music, but the first albums vocalist screams gave me the goosebumps. I hear a lot of progression musically on this album, but I like their first release better."
2,A very limited introduction to Danish,"Thank you to the others who posted reviews! Your information was a huge help. Once I knew the male voice wasn't Danish, I was able to ""model"" the female speaker and resolve the aural discrepancy. There's a marked difference in the pronunciation between the male and female speakers.A friend recommends the Rosetta Stone language learning series as very good. No ""pick-up"" lines. Honestly, what was the writer of the Danish series thinking?It's a real shame because the Pimsleur teaching method is sound: I was very surprised at how much I am retaining from the Pimsleur lessons, not only the vocabulary but the rules that govern the Danish language."
2,"No insight, no craft","This novel felt like weak chick lit, with plenty of disasters -- cancer, autism, bipolar disorder -- into which I gained no insight. There are many volumes of women's fiction that deal with cognitive difference in ways that are beautiful and valuable; this isn't one."
2,"Not too bad, just a little boring","This guy is quite fun to build, a little tricky in places so an adult needs to be nearby to avoid frustration. However, it is fun to play with on an imagination scale, but it does fall apart quite easily so that gets aggravating as well. If you mix it in with other Lego sets, then they can have more fun with this guy but to be honest, spend your $10 on something else. Don't really recommend this one."
2,decent beginner's book - cookbook style,"this books delivers many rules and rules of thumb. These are helpful mostly for beginners - contrary to the authors preface statement. The book covers opening , middlegame and endgame so we have a one-book-solution for a player who wants to do somthing for his play.However, the 12th edition might have been reworked as to eliminate some errata, mainly in the discussion of openings (p.53: D12 gets a ?, undeserved ! asf.)there was a good review in the magazine: ""Europa Rochade #10 2003 p.91"""
5,A big hit with our 1-year old,"Our daughter has been playing with this product for a few months and loves it. Pulling pieces apart and then putting them together (sometimes in ways that defy gravity) will hold her attention better than any other toy we have. She also likes the animal shapes. The product is durable and encourages creativity. Made in Switzerland is hard to beat. Only issue is I think the company overstates the ""rattle"" quality, because they don't really make much noise."
2,doesnt transfer heat,"I put it on the oil pan of a 650 motorcycle for 48 hours...pan wasnt even warm to the touch when I removed it. granted, the pan had cooling fins, but you'd think the fins would at least be warm."
2,Has a hard time keeping ITSELF warm.,I Ordered this to use on my tractor when the lower Rad hose heater crapped out. I had 2 problems with this:1: It does not get very warm in really cold outside temps.. I was using it in a portable car tent thing ... temp's were about 10F to zero F and this never got very warm.2: The oil pan on my tractor is non-magnetic?? pewter? Plastic??? so I had to put heater on the block ... and contact points were not very uniform so poor heat conduction as well.It may work better indoors on pipes (wont stick to copper??) but I had to repair the lower rad hose for the tractor.Tractor on
4,Kats Magnetic Heater,"This magnetic heater is convenient to attach and remove for different vehicles. The magnetic attachment maintains a firm grip on the vehicle engine for as long as you want. It does a good job of heating the oil pan enough to achieve dependable starting in cold weather. It has a temp control/thermostat which keeps the heater from running constantly.The down side is the design of the plastic handle attachment to the heat element and magnet. If the temp control fails and it keeps heating, the anchoring for the screw head melts. Of course, it comes apart when that occurs. I customized an old one by using a longer screw which protrudes through the top/handle mechanism."
5,AWESOME,"My husband loves this heater, we actually bought 2 of them, they work so well. We don't have to winterize the engine because of this little heater. Really like the seller, quick shipping."
5,Good working block heater.,I bought this for my Cub Cadet 129 engine and it works perfectly. I stick it on the oil pan and it heats the engine up enough to make starting even in below zero weather easy. It's small and the price is good.
2,Disappointing,"This is a re-mastered set of two videos. The original production must have been filmed in the 1970s, judging from the makeup, costumes, etc. It's the Glyndebourne Opera, so the singing is pretty good (but not nearly the best I've heard with respect to this opera), though a little too slow of tempo. Unfortunately, there's very little that's visually stimulating about this video. It also isn't subtitled, characteristically of Opera D'Oro. The singers only seem to do any acting in between singing, and not during the singing -- it's like they're almost frozen while singing and then they come to life as soon as they're finished. This is the London Philharmonic Orchestra. The vocal soloists are Anson Austin, Thomas Allen, Frantz Petri, Helena Dose, Sylvia Lindenstrand, and Daniele Perriers. I'll probably watch this tape very infrequently (if ever). And it's one of my favorite operas!"
3,"Acceptable, but plain production","Cosi is one of the most beautiful ensemble operas ever written, but alas, this video doesn't bring out its best. There are surely worse ways to spend an afternoon, but probably better ways to spend your money. It's palatable, but nothing like the great CD of Bohm's Cosi with Schwarzkopf and Ludwig. Contrary to the other reviewer, my copy did have some English subtitles -- but they were generally out of sync and useless for the ensemble pieces where the individual voices were unfortunately indistinct and mushy anyway. The best video of this opera is the 1994 Vienna production conducted by Harnoncourt with Gruberova and Stratas -- it is the best opera video I've ever, ever (did I say ever?) seen & heard, and I have a collection of 50 or so. Try to find that one, or stick with the Bohm CD, to grasp the true beauty of this Mozart masterpiece."
5,Best book I have read since 'The Firm',This 'feel good' book had all the aspects of small town football in Texas in the late 40s but also had a great message of right and wrong. I could not put this book down. Whish I could find more from John Carver. He covered all parts of life with with the best of taste. Great Book!!!!
4,Good book for High School boys...,"I am the librarian in a small West Texas, football oriented, school. We purchased this book as a request from one of our coaches whom read the book and made an Accelerated Reader test for us. The boys are reading it as fast as they can get their hands on it and they are giving it wonderful reviews. Although it is based during the 1940s they can still associate themselves in some of these athletic situations."
3,SO-So,It was OK but I really expected better from Dolly Parton. Not up to par with Nine to Five. It was worth buying.
5,awesome,"I accidentally had ordered two of the same thing, and they were great about emailing me a label for UPS so I could return it hassle free. I would definately use them again. Great customer service."
2,Not worth the cost,"Hedwig was supposed to be the perfect Christmas gift, but the one I received was very poorly made. (Sigh.) The eyes were completely covered by plush and were crooked; the ""feather"" painting looked like Magic Marker scribbles. Alas, I had to return poor Hedwig (but did get a quick refund)."
4,Good but not great,"Stories are somewhat simple and uneventful, I found Fiets Vase to be a much more interesting book with stories that made a greater impact on me."
2,Soviet Censored,"unfortunately Soviet approved, but lacks the courage to ask why he was there, not as much detail as Gulag Archipelago (best book on subject) but written of experiences earlier in the 1930's. Author seems to have taken the soft route in jobs (camp medical orderly etc) rather than the default way.According to this book the male criminal element (opposed to s.58) are all homosexuals, and all females in camps are prostitutes, but married to there gay criminal companions. Make of this what you will.Emphasises camp life only, no comments as to the validity of the state in its actions, or actions of Lenin, or Stalin. Or in fulling 5 year plans. A biassed account"
5,A truth about Communism that must be told,"Kolyma Tales is a brilliant author's way of telling the world what actually happened to him and his fellow slave laborers in the Gulag during Stalin's reign in the Soviet Union. It is a testimony to the total failure of Communism and the evils of a totaliltarianism bent on finding enemies among its own people. The stories tell of the misfortune and injustice Shalamov and countless other innocent people endured in the labor camps of arctic Siberia. He uses his 17 years there to give us heartwrenching insight into a part of history unknown to most of us. Solshenitsyn might be more famous in the West, but Shalamov's literary talent is in my opinion equally good. The fact that each story is independent from the rest makes for an easy read."
1,"Very cheap, poor quality case","This is quite possibly the poorest quality toolset I have ever seen. I can't even see how it's worth more than $20 let alone $59.99. The case is very cheap and looks like it will fall apart, and there are not even close to 235 tools. I suppose they count each wire terminal as a tool?"
2,You get less than what you pay for,"For the price you expect a fairly decent kit of tool in a decent portable case to use in your vehicle in case of emergency. The thing that struck me was the horrible quality of the case. The top latches pop off in your hands, and don't go back on easily, when you try. The tools are held in by plastic retaining clips that were broken or mis-formed. All the tools were everywhere, and 8 or 10 would not go back in their retainers. This makes for a nice rattle sound as you are driving... good fun. Most of the parts are small, clips, retainers, screw tips.... etc. You would be be better off getting a few decent tools from Home Depot or Craftsman and a small tool box. My biggest concern with the set is that it's for emergency.. and in an emergency, I would hate to rely on this quality."
2,Poor quality tools,"I bought this tool set hoping for a medium quality tool set for a great price, and it came in way below my expectations. First of all it's not actually a 235 piece set unless you count all the screws and connectors that were so graciously included. The needle-nose pliers were bent in the set I received, and overall the tool set is constructed poorly. The case makes the tools hard to get in and out of their positions, and some of the tools fall out when you carry the case gently. I would look elsewhere for a tool kit, because this one isn't worth the money."
4,tool set,i thought the item was great. the only thing was the box is difficult to fold open and snap shut at some points. besides that it's awsome.
4,"Oil in Texas: The Gusher age, 1895-1945","This book, bought for our son whose career is in the oil and gas industry, was just right for him. I had reviewed another copy while visiting my brother, Bill Fortune. He, too, received a new copy a few weeks ago and upon his recommendation, I decided to buy one for our son. I read quite a bit from the book before I passed it on and for sure want to read it all someday. The fact that it was once in a library made it quite interesting. We Texans enjoy all aspects of our state history and what I read did not disappoint. The preface was clear in expressing the intent of the book and I am certain that our son aw well as his wife [ her family has been in the West Texas oil and gas work for generations] will be blessed with this fascinating read. I recommend it for a gift to almost anyone who enjoys Texas history.Dorothy Fortune Hayner"
5,Very Very Good!!!!,This is a great phone. Only major concerns are that the ringer is not as loud as intended however all my calls so far have been crystal clear as sprint advertises. The reception on average is 3 bars. In hard rock buildings I get 1 bar or I am roaming (although my plan covers roaming charges). I did notice that the phone gets hot if you talk for more than an hour or so. As for some comments about the light being on during charging.... THATS BECAUSE YOUR USING THE TRAVEL CHARGER! you need to buy the desktop charger which is EXCELLENT! takes like 10-20 min to fully charge an almost dead battery. So invest your money into this phone it will be worth it.
1,crap phone,im getting a way better phone the sanyo 7400 thats a realy goodphone ive had no problems with the phone you can watch cartoons news weather and heaps of other stuff download heaps of thingsyou should so get this phone its so great ijf i were you i would get it its worth $600 dollars if your not allowed to get it it means your poor so get it deffinetly its the best phone well not the best phone but a really great great awesome phone so get it as soon as you can
1,Sprint PSC A680 phone,This phone is terrible when it comes to the AUDIO !!!I don't recommend this to anyone! I will be going back to NEXTEL
5,This is the best phone ever,"I just got this phone and I'm really impressed with the quality. It feels extremely well-built and not to mention it's beautiful design. I love everything about it so far. This phone is such an eye candy. I have people coming up to me and asking me what kinda phone this is. When I tell them that it has video, people go nuts. They can't believe all these features are packed into one tiny sleek silver phone. I love how the outside LCD is color and it can be used as a photo caller ID. Or you can use it to take pictures of yourself if you enjoy doing that sort of stuff. It also has voice dialing which is helpful when driving. Overall, this phone is the best on the market in my opinion. Everyone go get it! You won't regret it."
2,Feature-rich but poor audio,"Yes, this phone is good in almost everyway except the main thing I bought it for: talking/listening. The speaker sounds distorted and muffled -- much worse than my 3-year-old LG 5250. I'm considering returning or exchanging the VM-A680."
1,Total Waste!,This is the worst phone I have ever come across. I love Samsung phones but this phone is is awful. Softare keeps crashing and screen gets fuzzy/overlaps. I took this phone back to Sprint and the new phone is acting the same way. I thought maybe first phone was bad but once again second phone is falling apart. On top of that: My father has similar phone and it is doing the same thing. I wasted 250 dollars on this piece of crap.
3,GREAT,"This is great.. It works in my office building and my other phone didn't,so I consider it to be the best phone ever..I am so glad!! Everyone should buy this phone..It has great options and it also takes great pics that you can actually see.."
2,Too Narrow and no Wide option,"I am returning these shoes as they are too narrow in the front(I bought the correct size for my feet - 9.5 M), I am afraid if I buy bigger size they are just gonna get longer (9.5 already feels longer as it leaves more than an inch space from toe to the tip of the shoe.)and spoil the look. They feel like they are made for women's feet."
5,Best Razor,"Shaving is no longer a chore. Intuition razors make it quick and easy and my legs are actually smoother and softer than shaving with a traditional razor. The refills can get a little pricey, but it's worth it."
1,"Glides easily, but doesn't cut well.","Positives: Smells good and has a feminine rounded handle. When I used it I was surprised how easily it slide across my skin. Negative: However, when I checked the quality of the several passes by running my hand across the ""grain"" I was shocked how much stubble was left. Not at all pleased considering all those blades. Personally I have had better leg shaves with cheap disposable single blades. What a let down."
4,Great reference.,"These books are designed to be used as a quick reference. Not a classroom in a book. I noticed another reviewer mentioned he was an advanced user and didn't find the book useful. Quite frankly, if your that advanced I really don't see why you would need a reference manual. This is excellent to have around if you forget someting and need the information quickly. I did find the Quark visual quick start to be a little more informative..."
3,Not up to par with the other Quickstart books!,"I have read over 7 books in the Quickstart series. All of them have been very well written and has made me buy one after the other. I ordered this book to start and learn Illustrator 7. It does teach you alot about the program but... All the examples are dull and dry! I am a very patient reader, but I found myself looking at the clock and dreading the time everyday when I made my self sit down and read the book. She also overloads you with information on the program. Hopefully the WOW! Illustrator book will give me the info I need to learn the never ending knowledge for great web graphics=D"
4,Gives Simple Approach For Beginners,"This book is Great for beginners, but I am an advanced user and need something more advanced.;-)"
4,A entertaining guide to an entertaining drive,"I only discovered this book when I was past the half-way point of the very drive it describes. It added immensely to the remainder of the west bound drive and I used it to locate a couple of missed sites on the way back. US 80 doesn't have the current popularity of Route 66 or the Lincoln Highway but, as the ""All-Year Southern Route"" for ""Coast-to-Coast"" travel in the early days of the automobile, it was once one of the more important roadways in America. This is a great ""roadie"" book with plenty of history, sightseeing tips, and those details that help you put together your own two-lane experience. It is well written and illustrated and would probably make good reading for the arm chair traveler but it's real place is in the glove compartment."
4,decent but gets old,"The debut full length from the handshake murders is a decent slab or metalcore similer to coalesce, a life once lost. etc. All of the songs flow nicely and revolve around the breakdown. Which is the only really weak part on this cd. The handshake murders do not try to change anything up and rely wih the same formula for all of their songs."
2,Kinda light,"An adequate overview of the marque, but the model descriptions are fairly lightweight and there's next to no analysis of problems to expect or things buyers should look for. If you're going to hunt down an out-of-print Lambo book, better to spend your time looking for the ""Complete Book of Lamborghini"" by Pete Lyons, which has lots more info and better pictures, too!"
2,Not as current as Mr. Richard T Olsen describes it...,"A good resource for info on the earlier Lambos, but was purchased based on Olsen's review which clearly states that it covers the history including the Diablo model, which it clearly does not.What it does cover makes for a reasonable primer on early Lambos."
1,Mighty Morphin Power Rip-Off,"This is nothing more then a Power Rangers rip-off. It was just cashing in on the success of said show. Aside from that,the cast is bland & forgettable,the fights are luke-warm and the villian is 1D at best. Infact This whole show is forgettable. I mean,how many of you actually remember this show? I give this show a 0 out of 10."
4,What a movie!!,"I am always interested in Swords & Sorcery, and this, I reckon this was heaps cool! I loved Roin's courage and Engus's stupidity, because there's always a brave one & a coward. The dragons & monsters ruled in 3D, and, well, I loved this movie. ...."
1,Pathetic.,"I am surprised that Celtic legends can be lowered to such a horridly low point when they start to look like Power Rangers. Just like Power Rangers, ""Mystic Knights of Tir Na Nog"" features plenty of problems coupled with witless plots and senseless acting. The realism is nearly non-existent - the dragons look like they were taken from a low-grade science fiction featurette ( they don't breath gouts of flame - they shoot projectiles! ), the weaponry, armor, and barding is completely loose and looks like it's ready to fall off (especially the helm on the Knightess of Air, which is several sizes too large), and the characters are simply laughable ( one of the Knights is black. I see the point of preventing all racism, but, come on! , these are supposed to be Celts! ). The acting is simply idiotic, the scripts have gaping holes and uniteresting lines, and, best of all, only half of the characters can speak with a half-way proper Irish accent.I beg of you, please DO NOT buy this!"
4,Mystic Knights of Tir Na Nog,"My son has been watching this show since he was about 1 1/2 years old and has worn the 1st VHS tape out already. I wish it was on DVD, but it looks like I will have to get a 2nd VHS. My son started out saying ""Fire 'buv me"" but now has progressed to ""Fire 'in me, water 'round me, air 'bove me, earth beneath me, now how 'bout that armor!"" I wish the rest of the series could be put on VHS or DVD as well."
5,It was great!,I really liked the movie. It was great. There weren't too many really scary mean guys and the good guys were great. I liked the mystic armour that they got.
4,"Great for the head, not much for the heart","I think these are great stories, as long as you know what you're getting for your entertainment dollar. This is hard as a rock SF with a minimum of character development. The stories act as dressing for some very cool SF ideas, and the two main characters, McAndrew and Jeanne Roker, are there mainly to move the plot along. You never get the feeling that you know these people really well. But actually, that's OK, because the ideas in the stories are of the way-out-there cool physics genre. The ideas are usually sufficiently interesting to overcome the lackluster characterization. I'm glad that I finally have all of these stories in one volume."
4,Put on your thinking cap and get on board,"I am not fond of futuristic science fiction novels. I was not fond of futuristic science fiction novels, that is... Sheffield has converted me. His pseudo-physics speculation is fascinating. His stories keep your interest and don't waste time with undue detail. His characterization lags by comparison to the rest of the story - but is still better than most of your sci fi/fantasy writers. You spend the whole book thinking, ""That's really cool"" while you keep turning the pages to see what happens next. I highly recommend it."
1,Wow,I purchased this game for my sons birthday after he started playing this at preschool. I found out today it only runs on Classic Mac OS 9. Are you kidding me????? You are selling a game that only runs on a completely out dated operating system??? It doesn't say that anywhere in the description. We have 3 newer MACs and it won't run on our computers.
4,One Is Good . . Two Is Better!,"I purchased M&M's: The Lost Formulas for my 9 year old grandson. He likes this game so much that he ""needed"" one version at his house and one at Gramma's. He never gets bored playing."
5,Addictive and educational,"My older daughter began playing this game when she was about 7 years old. She sometimes used the math aspect, but soon learned how to turn the ""educational"" part off and just do the ""fun"" part. However, she liked the game so much that if I told her she could only play it with the math on, she would gladly play anyway. My younger daughter also loved the game when she got old enough to play. It was a sad day when the disk (somehow) was found with a crack in it. I will be surprising the girls with a new M&M game soon! My older daughter is now 12 and I am positive she will be thrilled when the game arrives. She may even review the math facts!"
5,Amazing,"Absolutely delicious extreme metal. Very melodic. Funny as it may sound, some of the songs even remind me of Queen. Recommended if you are just getting into this genre of great music..."
1,No llega nunca,Estaba previsto recibir este producto el dia 13 de septiembre del 2012 y estamos a 26 de septiembre del 2012 y aún no lo he recibido No me han notificado ninguna incidencia. ¿Lo recibiré algún dia o perderé el dinero?
3,language,Please advise if this DVD has a track for different languages. I am particularly interested in the Spanish translation. Thanks.
1,This DVD is not in COLOR as described,"I ordered this product believing that it is in color just like it is described in the product details ''Format: Subtitled, Color, Dolby, Full Screen ''. But when i got the DVD I am surprised to find that DVD is actually in Black and White. Likewise I ordered some other DVDs and they are yet to be consigned and I wish they comply with the product details presented by Amazon, though I seriously doubt it now."
4,Good news for fans of one of the greatest TV shows ever.,"We bought the Vol. 1 of Season 1 and now need another fix-:) I hoped Vol. 2 would have out out for the holidays but this is still excellent news. If the word is spread and more folks buy them, perhaps future volumes will be released sooner. So some of this could be up to us fans."
3,not the exact replacement I'd expected.,"I ordered replacement floor mats for my 2006 Prius and was assured they were exact. However, the replacements did not have the grommet holes needed to hook into the hooks that kept my original floor mats from working their way forward."
3,Let Me Rai,Disapppointed in the quality of the music; the one track from a movie on tv sounded better than on the CD player.
5,the best!,I really like this atlas of human anatomy. It is one of the best in the world!Very good pictures and understandable explanation.
1,Don't waste your money,"I choose this burner because the advertising claimed it was problem-free and compatible with my HP computer, but I have had nothing but trouble with it. It vibrates and hums like a cement mixer, and more than half of the time my computer does not recognize it - a common problem for this model."
1,HP=Hate Product,I had tried several HP products and they were poorly manufactured with tones of problems. This one is also a bad one. Its customer service is certainly NO service at all. HP needs to fix its problems to stay in business. Avoid HP for now.
1,Worked fine till it died,"I was so excited when I brought this home. All for a game I so badly wanted to play and this looked and sounded good. Wish I knew what the future was going to bring. I used this to play games for a few months then left it sit for a couple more. Cleaned it up and tried to play again. Nothing. It whirs like it's going to work, then grinds to a halt. I never even was able to burn the slide shows I spent forever working on. I'll also never know how the lightscribe works either. Junk. It was an expensive piece of junk. Now it sits as a reminder of what not to spend on something I know nothing about. The pros? It was easy to install and didn't take up much space on my desk. Not all that bad to look at either. wasn't very noisy either. But that's it."
3,Grinding noise,I've had my HP Lightscribe for almost a year now. I've burned several discs front and back with no problem. What I'm currently experiencing is a grinding noise when I put a cd in the unit. It just started doing this. Thinking perhaps that it was the media I tried several different cds with the same symptom.
2,Scattershot -- Louis J Sheehan,Scattershot -- with some targets being interesting -- while the viewer is left to develop themes. Louis J Sheehan
4,Nice watch,"I have used this watch for two years and I have no complaints. The watch is really nice and still looks good. It has worked as expected. The only ""tiny problem"" was that in a hot summer day I submerged my hand in a pool and there was condensation inside the watch. The condensation disappeared after a week or two."
2,Nothing much,"There are lots of other, better books on the Beatles and on McCartney. This one is basically a hodge-podge coffee table book, combining a few interviews with Beatles-related folks (George Martin, Klaus Voorman, Pete Best, Peter Asher, Donovan, etc.)with some memories of Beatles press officer Tony Barrow and some fawning drivel by one of Paul's modern toadies telling us what he's been up to lately. This book was apparently rushed to market, as it has no central concept, a few typos, and the book actually ends in the middle of a sentence. Most of the ""unseen"" photos are boring, blurry shots from 1960s television that we could have done without. If this book has any value, it is from the odd collection of guest interviewees; most of these folks have been heard from in other places before, but still, a decent Beatles anecdote is always worth a glance."
2,Don't judge the book by it's glossy cover,"Sorry to say that this glossy looking generously-formatted book is nothing more than a badly written amateur article blown up with shockingly poor photo material (taken from videos, other books). That the author even dares to mention that he visited Paul at home for this should embarass him deeply.A rip off, nothing else.R. Kruschak, Germany"
2,Hokum,"All those stars from seven reviewers ?!?!? Amazing. Might the unbelievably generous four and five star reviewers have been blinded to the fact that this is incoherent nonsense by their fondness for Nighy and Blunt, or Richardson? I think they're great too, even here, but they can't salvage this mess of a screenplay. Cheap shots abound: the grieving parents, both of them loony enough to let such a young child ride on such a dangerous street and going loonier after his death; the absurd media mogul Nighy is supposed to court; the tasteless misuse of Diana; that embarrassing song. It's all just too much, too far-fetched and too silly."
1,Reading Winspear,"The English tendency to say 'eh' after each sentence is unavoidable when reading Violet Winspear. Even her bad novels, like Valdez Marriage, are good for vivid portrayal of place and atmosphere. But there is something about the writing that is not sufficiently modern."
1,Depressing,"I bought this book for my college daughter who is recovering from a recent break up with her boyfriend of 2 1/2 years. I decided to read the book myself before I gave it to her and I'm so glad I did. Although Joanna's experiences are honest and humorous, I found them also very depressing. It was the pattern of her relationships that bothered me. I don't want my daughter to think this is the first in a long line of heartbreaks ahead."
4,Too Late,"It is a shame that the GTP870 HD 7.1 is no longer in stock. I purchased mine 6 months ago, and just hooked it up to an Adcom 7 channel amp. This control amp is great. There are more connection options than you will ever need, and the configuration options can be overwhelming, but just take your time with the setup. The only hassle is uploading the new firmware. You will need a special cable assembly to communicate via a legacy com port on your PC. Good luck with that. Once you get past that, you will be happy with this unit. Go to Adcom's website for more information."
2,Sorely Disappointed,"I heard ""Open Your Eyes"" on Seattle's KEXP and loved it, hearing echoes of Daft Punk. But none of the other songs are as tight or interesting as that one, so I was really let down. Even the start of the album is a wishy-washy fade-in, rather than a bump or a jump.I still love ""Open Your Eyes"" and I repeated ""Emerald City"" as soon as it finished but none of the other songs really caught my ear and made me think of a party. I guess I should have bought a Daft Punk album instead."
2,Too much vocoder,"This album has already been made, and done better, in Daft Punk's ""Discovery."" One song even features the faux-metal arpeggios first heard in Daft Punk's ""Aerodynamic."" There's nothing wrong with disco anthems, but when six in a row feature vocoder, the party gets old quick. An instrumental interlude provides brief respite before some truly nauseating rapping kicks in, with yet more vocoder action. The one bright spot is the use of real drums and instruments, taking the party out of the clubs and into the vinyl-filled living rooms of indie rock kids."
1,Waste of money,Does not stick well....very thin and tears easily. A waste of money and I bought several rolls in different colors... very disappointed.
1,education station gets a -1 or an f grade from me,"product was great, EDUCATION STATION was terrible!!! i paid about $11 for shipping that took two weeks from them, and i also ordered two rolls of white that came directly from amazon with free shipping and took three days.i used the white for part of my project, then sat back and waited almost two weeks to finish the blue. you can imagine how handy that was for me. i'll never order from EDUCATION STATION again."
3,foghorn at his best,"I would give this set 5 stars if it only had foghorn, butt for some reason they included a bunch of other shorts that had other cartoon stars. You would expect nothing butt foghorn, butt hollywood has screwed us again. This will give you a good dose of foghorn, butt it will want you craving more. The sad part is that for whatever reason, finding old time cartoons is almost impossible."
3,Not entirely what I was expecting,"Of the 15 cartoons included on the disk, six were not Foghorn Leghorn cartoons, but what they called ""friends"", which is disappointing."
4,True Story,"Leghorn Foghorn has always been my favorite cartoon character. however, i purchased this for a good friend (he's 60 years old) who loves him even more that i do. he was elated to get it. plus, i just learned that there is such a thing as a leghorn foghorn chichen. beat that!! obviously i'm a city boy."
3,Where is the first Foghorn Leghorn cartoon?,"This DVD was pretty good, but I was hoping to see some of the earlier Foghorn Leghorn cartoons, such as the one he first appeared in where Henry Chicken-hawk was the main character. I would have much rather see that and other earlier ones than the racist ones that ""reflected the humor of the time"" and DID NOT feature Foghorn Leghorn."
1,This was a waste of time and money,"I love Warner Bros. cartoon with Bugs and all the rest, but these people keep on putting the worst cartoons in these collections, and none of the best. Save your money and buy something more worth watching, like Gigli or Ishtar (broad sarcasm added)."
5,Outstanding service,My dad has been talking about this cartoon character for years. I did a search and found video on Amazon and ordered it to surprise my dad. It arrived in a few days and I couldn't sleep waiting to see his face when he opened it. The smile that came on my 79 year old father was PRICELESS. I started crying. Great product and fantastic delivery.
4,Pretty good collection,"Like the other posters I was happy to see that WB has released these cartoons in their original aspect ratio. I enjoyed this collection for the most part; there were a few cartoons that I found boring, but it was great seeing the ol' Foghorn in top form. Beautiful job of restoration done, too. All in all, it's a nice tribute to Robert McKimson.Complaints? Just one...the politically correct disclaimer card at the start of the disc lasts for freakin' EVER! Okay, WB, we get it; the cartoons are pre-PC; you don't have to make a federal case out of it.Recommended."
5,Seinfeld's always cool,"Seinfeld is always cool no matter which season this is. I highly recommend this season . ""We're having a whole lot of fun here at home"""
1,I love Seinfeld. But got no slipcase,Beware if ordering new from Amazon. They send you the slim line case where all the discs are inside one dvd box. Not individual cases. It's cheaper that way and if you have slip cases it won't look good on a shelf. They need to change the description.
5,"Great, just like the previous seasons!",The Seinfeld sitcom has been one of my favorites. I can not wait until the remainng seasons come out.
2,Bad news with this one...,We had to wait about 2 extra weeks for this Seinfeld Season 8 DVD set to arrive only to find it was defective. Two episodes on disk 4 could not be watched. We're now trying to get said disk replaced. Sometimes is works and sometimes not!
3,anoying comercial,the DVD's are ok except for a very annoying commercial in spanish at the beginning that cannot be skipped.
2,They Lost The Edge,"Season 8 definately is a change, and not necessarily for the better. The departure of Larry David is very evident. The series now has the feel of bad vaudeville. I wish I had rented instead of buying."
5,Seinfeld Season 8,"Seinfeld - Season 8If your a Seinfeld TV show fan you must have already collected seasons 1 to 7, don't stop there you have to get this one, it's full of classic shows and quotes you will use in your every day life, just like I do at work. The extras & behind the scenes make the whole experience a riot. I want more."
5,Great Season,"I am a huge seinfeld lover, i have all of the seasons but this one is one of the best by far. Great buy."
4,Seinfeld as Usual,Seinfeld is always great! This season seems to be a little different in that it is more slapstick comedy rather than alot of verbal comedy and discussions. It is still excellent in its way! Am anxious for Season 9!
5,Seinfeld Must Have,"Season eight met all of my expectations. I have all eight, which will come in handy during my retirement years (30 years to go)."
3,MY 2 CENTS - REAL HIT AND MISS,"Don't want to reiterate all the past comments - just want to say that this season is real hit and miss. The characters did become, just characters. The rhythm and pacing of the show changed drastically with Larry David's departure.You'll probably sit through the first disc with a smirk on your face, but few season 3-7 type laughs. Even the audience laughter on this season is canned. A REALLY bad sign. Even Kramer's entrances seem forced.Look, ya gotta see it. And if you already own Seasons 1-7, you have to own it. But Jerry and the gang were already past their creative peak.Jerry knew it too. He tried it for one more year - but even he couldn't bring himself to round it off with a Tenth Season.The magic was beginning to go. Fortunately, enough remained to make it through Season 8. You will too."
5,Everybody loves Seinfeld,"It is true. Everybody seems to love the Seinfeld show and I had never seen it when it first came out...So I ended up purchasing the whole series... I started with one season but it is much like pate de foie gras, once you start, you cannot stop. Too delightful, funny and entertaining."
3,error on disc...,I love Seinfeld but i had to give this product 3 stars because season 8 does not play in my dvd player but will play in my xbox?? I brought all nine seasons at one time from the same seller and all seasons except 8 &9 will not play in the dvd player. i think it's something wrong with the discs? but all in all the seasons are very funny and product is good as long as u can watch it.
3,"Nice Book, Needs A Little More Horses","This book has many wonderful photos but it seems sometimes that the focus is more on human celebrities rather than their magnificent equine counterparts. There is also no information on any of the horses whatsoever except name and what race it was. Interesting book to skim through, but not something you could spend hours on, or even one hour."
5,It works,"It did it's job, No problems. What can I say it was a part I needed to fix mt Craftsman mower"
4,Solenoid for starter on craftsman tractor,"This seems to be the same thing as on so many old FoMoCo cars and trucks! Cheap part, first one lasted since the tractor was new, so since 2001. I'm sure this one will last another 9+ years. Delivery was fast, product works. What more is there to say?"
2,Brutal,This book may be a good supplement to advanced fluids majors but there is no description of the mammoth equations used in this text. I bought this in 86 for my aero course and never used the book.
4,soothing indian music,"I copied this music from a friend back in the 90's but i lost the casette. Today i found the self written cover and i also found it as a cd her at Amazon. Marvellous! Now it's on my wish list and will soon be in my possesion.But i remember the songs fron the casette i had. And it is good. Meditative music. Kind of ""Brian Eno""ish.The new tracks that are on this cd are new to me and i look forward to hearing them."
3,Negatif,"I found the cd's 'interesting'. He features such a wide eclectic mix of songs: folky, jazzy, swank, electronica. So points for that. It is very unique.I did find it difficult to get into because of the language barrier though. Also some of the songs are downright sleep-inducing-slow (maybe that's what he's going for).I would've liked to see this cut down to one tight compact single disc because there are some good cuts on there. It's just not as tremendous as I was expecting it to be.Pick this one up if you're into odd, different, eclectic music or French music in general. Just don't pay full Import price - it's available for cheaper on other sites."
2,A Big Disappointment for the Lagerfeld-savvy,"No plot, no concrete idea, but merely a dvd on bits and pieces of Lagerfeld's luxurious life.With his charisma, talent, wits and a substantial contribution to fashion, Lagerfeld definitely deserves a far better documentary."
1,Three questions: Rings? Collar? Sunglasses?,"Absolutely agree with review by Collector ""Collector"" but have to add: Why, oh why didn't the filmmaker ask Lagerfeld about the rings, the glasses and the collar? He hovered his camera on them, lingered on Lagerfeld's bowls and bags of bulky rings, even followed him into the MFA where Lagerfeld admired suits of armor and the filmmaker zoomed in on the armor fingers, indeed, very reminiscent of Lagerfeld's rings. So, not a single question? Instead the filmmaker minced around like a junior high school nerd on the ""question"" of the designer's sexual orientation? Terribly boring and tedious. Made this viewer feel like a slightly dirty voyeur - who nevertheless didn't get to see anything that gave much insight into the artist at all!"
3,not particularly entertaining,"i mean Mr Lagerfeld himself, not the movie. His attraction to his model muse due to his thighs seems misplaced if not mystifying and his addiction to thinness seems particularly a waste of time. The Valentino film is much more entertaining than this but then again, so is he personally so maybe that's the difference. We did learn Lagerfeld lives all over the world which we knew and flies in private jets which we knew so not a whole lot of new here except his devotion to dogs which seems to match the Queen's obsession with her corgis which makes him more human. To the degree that was in question, his staff and his videographer seem devoted to him which is a very good sign. Liked movie, not sure about him."
3,hulk ballet: it's not pretty,"The previous reviewer is right. This video is made up of images lifted right out of the comics (Hulk #1 and Tales to Astonish #66)--they literally float across the screen. Hulk's not very graceful, but you can see him here cut an even line. This is proto-animation and not very good. Why get it? You get to see Kirby and Ditko art on tv. Not only that--if you're a Hulk fan you've got to hear to this awesome theme song (UPN's Hulk song ""Hulk! Hulk! Hulk! Hulk!"" is put to shame.)Only recommended for die-hard Hulk fans (or Kirby fans)."
3,A animation curiosity,"I was stunned when I saw this video! ""The Origin Of The Hulk"" was simply lifted, panel-for-panel, from Lee and Kirby's classic story from The Incredible Hulk #1. Having seen ""Clutch Cargo"" I thought I had seen the lowest of cheap animation, but NO! They took almost every panel from the comic, recolored them, and simply animated the mouths and arms! How much did Marvel pay for these cartoons back in 1966?!? The second episode, ""The Power Of Dr. Banner"", was even worse! And yet, somehow, I still felt I got my money's worth...simply for the origin story. You do get to see the classic Kirby artwork on the TV screen. It's worth a look from comic and animation fans, but don't expect quality on parr with the ""Silver Surfer"" or ""New Adventures OF Batman And Robin""..."
1,"Before the TV series, we got THIS!","Before the 70's tv series, all we had was this. I fell bad for everyone who wached this. All this is are pictures flying across the screen and mouths cheaply moving. And why does the hulk talk? Yes, he does talk like in the old comic and he sounds like frankinstein instead of what you would think he would talk like.This was very bad, even for the 60's. Get the tv series instead."
1,HIPster Wars - News from the Bach Front - Communiqué 34,"As if inspired by Stockhausen, I am more than prepared to believe that this 1980 performance of the B Minor Mass by Eugene Jochum was recorded underwater and at full fathom five. Or perhaps it is a mystical appreciation of the One as the Cloud of Unknowing.Trust me on this: when the infamous Karajan alternative from 1974 - the Festival of Soup (Bach: Mass in B minor) - is streets ahead in terms of clarity, presence, diction and the separation of powers, it is time to complain.It is impossible to comment on the mettle of the soloists in this EMI performance. They look B-grade on paper (in a non-perfunctory sense) but perhaps on the day they surpassed themselves or fell to the rung below. Who is to know?I like Jochum's pacing in the work but that's the only surety I have.This early digital recording should come with a fog-horn: Ooooooooooooooooo-rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr.Bach J.S: Mass in B Minor / Cantata Bwv 56"
5,This book is sick and spooky. I loved it.,I am a big true crime fan. What I like about Mendoza's book are the murderers he chooses to cover -- they're not the same one's you always hear about. His unadorned prose and direct approach storytelling lets the grisley facts speak for themselves. I couldn't put this book down but I'm glad I'm finished with it... it kept me up at night.
5,a must read for anyone interested in serial killers,"who knew there were so many serial killers throughout the world. I loved this book. it paints a fascinating picture of different serial killers on the loose and the investigators looking for them. in a couple chapters mendoza chronicles how suspects are finally brought to justice, giving us a first-hand look of how serial killers are caught."
2,college book,"The only thing i really like about this book is that its cheap. I only bought this book for my Political Theory class, I dont think I wouldve bought it if not for that."
3,It's ... OK ...,"I used this a lot on my XP based DELL Inspiron 640m laptop. I was able to record sound and video of old VHS-C tapes, convert them to video files, and upload them to Google Video. The quality was not fantastic, but neither was that of the original source tapes that were twenty years old.Now I have a Vista based DELL Vostro 200 (desktop) and I can get the video and take screen shots and such, but no matter what I do--NO AUDIO! Very unhappy. I'll update this review if I can get it to work, with details on how."
1,Terrible trash,"This product was terrible. Purchase of it was a really nightmare. When I tried to install it on my laptop, my laptop got blue-screen death. Then my friend tried on his laptop. His laptop got blue-screen death too. The worse thing was the audio device and CD driver of my friend's laptop were damaged by this junk after the failed installation. It is a terrible, dangerous trash. Nothing else."
1,Awful,Missing batteries. Vista drivers are missing the MPEG and MPEG2 codecs. Tech support is no help. Device has problems with sending data at full resolution of 720 X 480 so pictures pause and start. I contacted their tech support which was no help. They always kept answering questions with questions. Eventually they stopped responding all together. I had to return the product. I do not recommend this product to anyone unless you enjoy wasting your time.
2,not so usb,"software installation on winxp sp2 locks the usb box to a specific port, and you can't change it to any other port. If you do, it'll ask you to re-install the driver again, and reinstallation will just fail. It's also not happy with my on-board realtek audio device, you still get the sound, but you wouldn't be able to control sound volume from winDVR. In general, I don't think the software is properly tested with the box, totally ruined my first impression with sabrent. They'll need to send me a good product for free in order for me to buy their product again.!!"
2,Beware,"If you want to record the game console like PS3, beware!! I tried several times to record from ps3 and it's not work. However, this device work on gamecube, so I have no idea why this one does not work on ps3. I used the same setup for both console. If anyone can help me to answer, I will be very appreciated."
1,junk,"This thing does a junk job. I hear some have gotten it to work, and kudos to them, but they must have PHD's in computer programming. This is not a user friendly product. After two days of downloading Vista drivers, testing, and retesting, and setting it up, I got absolutley nowhere - and I am pretty learned in computers. It is not worth the hassle for the low quality it is. You get what you pay for - I sent mine back. Sorry Sabrent, better luck to you on your next product."
1,Drek,"Would not install. Period. (Modern Alienware laptop, XP, properly updated)I tried all the techniques mentioned in the reviews. I tried following the instructions. I tried doing what Windows wanted. No matter. Nothing but the Blue Screen. It's going back."
1,Buy another product !!!,"I had purchased this product for use with my laptop computer, only to find that it did not work well with it at all. If you use it with a desktop computer, however, it will work fine, but finding this out defeated the purpose of my purchase. InterVideo's tech support about this product was not only lousy but left me with the feeling my self-esteem had been somewhat diminished after the (long-distance) telephone call. I found it wiser to get my money back from the vendor and return this product instead.[..]"
3,Not the best TV tunner I have had but not the worst either.,"Pros: The software for watching TV is very easy to set up and use. The video capture and screen shot features are very good quality. The DVR function is a nice addition to the software.Cons: WARNING, DO NOT use the install software to set up the device driver, It crashed my system and corrupted my CD rom and onboard sound card drivers, I had to do a re-install of windows to fix it. Just plug in the USB and let the windows found new hardware wizard search the CD for a driver. Also the sound is very quiet coming from the USB connection, It works better to plug speakers into the audio output on the unit. And I have an issue with low frame rate and the video ( but not audio ) skipping while playing in full screen mode and my system is top of the line."
1,Extremely disappointed with Defective product listed as used-like new.,Item was recieved with a defect in cable **split** going into the tv box therefor would not work on computer. I had to repair the unit my self in order to get it to finally work properly. It was VERY disappointing to me that the seller listed the item as used-like new when in fact it had two scratches on the top of the unit which did not bother me as much but the split cable going into the unit was causing a short that could have possibly damaged my computer. When purchasing from this seller I would recommend getting seller to check ALL cables and product for any defects before purchasing the item from the seller if the seller is listing it as a used-like new product. If item is going to be defective then it should be listed as defective and NOT as used-like new.
1,Don't waste your money!!,This product doesn't work neither Vista nor Windows XP. I don't understand how this kind of low quality products can be offered by amazon. It must be withdrawned!!
4,It good way to use on laptop.,"This small machine had 480i resolution, not HD. it good for when you want to play game, but someone's using the TV. Your laptop pc it a good choice for secodary TV. It watchble,recordble, and use any where. It is a good chice when you using for tv without have fight for the tv, because your pc could be your second way to tv.P.S. it good when you have a small speaker on the side, because you don't want to connect to Tvbox audio when using as tv, not record any thing."
1,I won't dare,I guess I must have to stay away from such item since everybody is gettin' a blue screen/death.Wish to try it out though so I wld have the opportunity to sue somebody!
1,useless,i dont know if its just me or this thing dont really workmaybe i didnt install something right but it definitely didnt work for me. they say it uses a system to look for channel that is not in the US or something... waste of money
3,Sabrent USB20 Capture box w/remote,I am using this product with my digital signage. It was fairly easy to setup as long as you knew the serial number it was asking for was printed on the CD case and not the one on the device itsself. It works well for the application i have it for but i end up replacing it about once a year after it goes out. You get what you pay for.
3,Almost works on Windows 7,"Plugging in this device on Windows 7 automatically installs a driver called TV Walker QQ. Although the software complains about compatibility problems, InterVideo WinDVR runs fine on W7. The problem I had is I was not able to get the tuner to tune any channels off my cable connection (and I have another tuner that does). Nothing but static. I was able to get the SVIDEO connection to capture the video, but I then had to pipe audio directly into the PC. Luckily the streaming software I'm using (BroadCam Video) doesn't have a problem with this, though the latest version of VLC does.BTW: Sabrent does have Windows 7 driver for the device on their website, but it won't install on Windows 7. I emailed their support, but I'll be very suprised to see a fix. Looking at the driver INF file, it came straight from the Chip manufacture (Trident) and wasn't touched. If someone finds an up-to-date driver, please drop me a note at mike-at-mpsharp-dot-com."
4,VERY NICE TRANSACTION,"I LIKED THIS PRODUCT, I CAN WATCH TV ON MY LAPTOP, RECORD DVD MOVIES FROM MY OLD 8 MM VIDEO CASETS, RECORD PROGRAM'S TV SHOWS.. THIS IS A NICE PRODUCT FOR A GOOD PRICE.."
3,good for recorder to the computer,"good for recorder to the computer, not for watch tv ,because the frame/s is slow,but if you want record old VHS tape to DVD,is good,to even record direct TV,it you wants for that,I recommend it"
1,"You get what you pay for,",Does NOT work on Vista! System restores and reboots galore before I finally gave up and considered it my own fault for trying to save a buck or two. My advice...spend the extra dollars for a tuner that works and stay away from this one!
1,No Vista Drivers,eh.. my computer doesn't have drivers for XP so I can't downgrade and this device doesn't have vista drivers. So it just sits here unplugged.
1,WARNING: This Thing Will F*** Your Computer Up!!!,"I bought this product because it was so cheap, and then realized that it didn't have a vista driver on the cd. Being very inexperienced with computers, I decided to install the xp driver instead. Long story short, I had to use system recover on my computer after I got the blue screen of death every time I tried to start it up. All in all, I lost WAY more than this product is worth in software and music. DO NOT BUY!!!!"
3,Its ok,This device has a good picture and it came with dvr software which is an amazing utility. Highly recommend this tuner to anyone interested in buying a TV tuner.After having to replace usb cable It works much better that it ever did previously. Still its a very buggy device.
2,"Worked with 1 computer I tried it on, not with one with Vista","You might want to refer to my discussion on this product.This tvbox worked with my XP system, but not with my Vista laptop. I think -I'm no expert though, it has something to do with the HDaudio driver not being WDMcompatible.The support hasn't helped me at all so far. Very generic replies and they haven't replied to my latest support request.If you want a tv tuner to work with vista media center I recommend you look for one compatible at microsoft marketplace. This one is definetely not compatible."
1,very disappointed,"When I tried setting up this tuner on my laptop (a Dell Inspiron 8600 running Windows XP Pro, 512 MB RAM and an NVIDIA video card), I could only tune to 4 (FOUR!) cable channels. Although tech support was helpful at times, I could only access them via email; Sabrent's phone line NEVER offered live customer service. This was a complete waste of time/money. The return process, which was very easy, was by far the best part of this experience."
1,big disappointment,It isn't as described; doesn't perform like it is described. All it gave me was a scrambled picture for the tv stations. It could be used only for VHS and not for DVD or television use as described. This product was a big disappointment to me and would not be recommended to anyone for any reason. It was a waste of monies and not worth the hassle of trying to get a refund! Just junk as far as I'm concerned.
3,U pay what u get for,"I bought this product almost 6 months ago, and i still cant resolve the problem i have with it. Video quality is good, and u can record you're favorite programs and all that stuff, but my problem is that the audio sounds like if there was interference, so as the video, and i just cant resolve it."
2,"Works, but can't reccomend it.","For the price, it can't be beat as a way to watch TV on my PC monitor. But included software is far out of date for this type of device and the software didn't even come with the code required for activation - had to find it in a less-than-legit place online. Hadn't really planned on using it as a PVR so I can't speak to those functions. It is a rather old Pentium 4 machine that I use it with as opposed to a multimedia powerhouse. If I had a nice media PC, I would shop for something in a higher price range rather than muck around with this."
4,USB Video Converter,This is a great device for copying your VHS tapes to DVD. The only caution I have is that you have to be careful with Windows updates as if you update the USB driver that comes with the device it may stop functioning. I have not used the TV tuning function of this device.
3,Its not sabrent,"sound quality is low and not Sabrent, is a generic brand, but the price is very allowable to, I have problems with the driver, the screen goes black"
2,Somewhat Disappointing,"Davis' first book is arguably one of the best first books of poetry published in the last decade. Unfortunately, Davis' new collection is a let down. The keen sense of conveying emotional resonance is still here, but the work has become sloppier in the name of becoming more experimental. Many of these poems are downright trite. I will keep reading Davis' poems. And I hope the next book is as stunning as her first."
1,An Abomination,"Just to clarify, this is not an episode of the real Captain Kangaroo show, but a short-lived substitute made by Saban (creator of the Power Rangers) which aired on CBS shortly after they fired the real Captain Kangaroo. They invited Bob Keeshan to appear on the show as a character named ""the Admiral"", but after one look at this program, he swore to have nothing to do with it - ever. This is how they repay him for his decades of service to children? The man inspired Mr. Rogers, and all modern kid shows. He deserved better. Having seen this thing myself, I can say that it is an unholy abomination, to be avoided at all costs."
4,"Entertaining, funny, and a bit sad too","Years ago, Neil McCormick wanted to be in a band that would be just as famous as U2. He and his brother try to make this happen. That is what you will be watching in this film. I don't want to spoil it too much. Suffice to say that they have quite a struggle for several years. U2 is not the focus here, but they are featured prominently and clearly went along with the whole thing. It's sad to watch Neil and his brother clash over their dreams, but funny to watch them try to make it in the music industry."

5,Great 80's,"Season 4 was probably the best of all, even though it has a sad end.It gets better and better with every season :)"
4,the way we were.,"Interesting short story. Out dated, but giving fascinating into the level of technological thought in those days, as well as social and cultural attitudes, and levels of patriotism prevalent. Plus a good story, well told."
2,Could relate prophecy more to modern times,"There is so much in prophecy that Montague seems to have missed -- so many analogies that relate to our modern times, weapons, nuclear warfare and current political unrest. Charles Miller (Modern Technology in Bible Prophecy) has pulled together the books of the bible that are prophecy and clearly related them to each other and to modern times. This interpretation is so new and so clear that he surely must have been inspired by the Spirit of God to understand these prophetic messages. Montague has made some good analogies, but could make many more. Since the early 80's many of the prophecies dealing with modern technology have come to pass, but we were unable to understand them prior to the invention of the technolgy. Montague has not addressed these messages in his book, but perhaps he will as he seems to be searching just like the rest of us, and with his background, sooner or later will come to a full understanding which he can then share with us."
5,very good,"NWA still held it down even on their last CD. it wasnt exactly their follow up to straight outta compton cuz theres still 100 miles and runnin, but i consider this alot better a follow up than 100 miles and runnin. its got really g'd out trax like dayz of wayback, appetite for destruction, alwayz into somethin, approach to danger, real n*ggaz and real n*ggaz dont die. i believe every song on there is good and they werent slippin away from hard on that album, even it was their last. they came out hard and they remained it to the end and its evident in this album. if u want to feel nwa get straight outta compton and n*ggaz4life. rip eazy e"
