5,Travel of Surprises,"I enjoyed the book very much. I started reading it as if it would be just a guide of places to visit for their panoramic beauty. I was most surprised to find myself immersed and truly enjoying their history, their culture. Mr. Price has done an excellent job in describing the richness of our civilization. I would recommend this book for the parent that wants to spice an exciting trip with the flavor of culture."
4,Surprisingly Enjoyable,"I wasn't sure what to expect with this one, but I purchased it because I'm a major Rosemary Clooney fan. The show takes place at Michael Feinstein's club and the show is all him except for a couple of songs he does with Rosemary Clooney. I always felt like he became famous more by the people he knew than anything, but he shows a true talent here and the show was surprisingly enjoyable. If you are buying it for Rosemary Clooney's part in it be aware that this show was done in her later years and she is only on here for 2 or 3 songs. I wouldn't pay a lot for this show, but if the price is right it's a good evening's entertainment."
4,Enjoyable music,"Good saxophone sound. I play the sax, and this music has a nice sound. I tapped my feet and it put a smile on my face."
3,Didn't entertain me,"What can I say? This book is a good book, I can tell. The plot is fresh, the expression is almost excellent. But it didn't appeal much to me. Maybe it only sustains its appeal to only certain people. It lost me halfway through its plot and failed to recapture me. It does have its good points of course, including a good develoment in character and as mentioned before, good expression in the first persona. other than that, you can afford to give it a skip."
3,I was Disappointed!,"After the rave reviews I expected a pair of gorgeous earrings. But, the leverbacks were quite large, too large for me. But, the worst thing was the CZ's were just dead. I own several CZ's and all of them sparkle greatly. NOT these. Maybe you'll get lucky and get a pair that shine. Mine didn't! I'm sending them back."
2,DECEIVED,"This product's problem, is that the maps are obsolete, and no technical support reachable.Errors, in directing to routes 25 % too long compared to Mapquest, or Mapgoogle.Not possible to get the maps update. Cheaper in price, cheaper in value"
2,Shoe runs small and narrow,"My son is eight and has been wearing Sperry shoes for years. This shoe looks very nice however it runs small and narrow. The first pair I bought was a 1 1/2 M and was so narrow my son could not get his foot in the shoe; the second pair I ordered in wide and they are still too small. He has a new pair of topsiders in the same size and they fit great. After sending back two pair I am not sure if I will order again, especially since I have to pay to return them and it is not possible to make an exchange."
5,Perfect For My Boy #1,"My grandson inherited his dad's foot problems and requires expensive shoes for foot support. These shoes are perfect for him but not as expensive as some of the other shoes we've had to pay through the nose for... They look good, fit perfectly, and give him the required support he needs...."
4,"Great shoes, but perhaps odd sizing.","We have been purchasing these shoes for about 5 years, though not through Amazon. This shipment was well packaged, and was quickly shipped. However, the sizing seemed a bit odd. The 13.5 should have been the right size for my son, but he couldn't even slip on the shoes.So, great shoes, but be sure of sizing before ordering."
5,Perfect,You can not beat these shoes. We have owned at least one pair per year as his feet have grown and despite regular kid wear they have never let us down.
5,perfect,I purchased these for my sons to wear for my sister's wedding. They looked so good and the kids loved them. the sole is non-slip. Everyone thought the kids looked so smart in them:) I would recommend them to anyone. The price is good too.
1,polaroid film isnt made anymore,"customers should know that the polaroid film used in these cameras is no longer made and very hard to find. otherwise, this is such a cool toy!"
2,This is the same book as My Uncle is a Hunkle!,"An awesome book that deserves 6 stars BUT this is the same book as My Uncle is a Hunkle with a different cover and name. So, I bought it hoping to see more about Uncle Ted only to find that it was the same book. Perhaps this is my fault for not reading reviews carefully, but who ever expects the same book to be sold under two different names? Not me. Great book - but turns out I already had it!"
5,Practical,"This is a great book for Western church life. If you have ever been in a mainstream church this book is one to have on your reading list. It touches home on many issues, gives excellent comparisons and practical applications in our churches today. For any of us who have experienced division in congregations, Richardson heads up a real life strategy for working through these tough situations. I enjoyed reading this book and would recommend it to anyone in a Pastoral or clergy role."
3,"It arrived. I haven't read it yet, though!","This product arrived, an intact book, within a convenient time frame. I have read a few chapters, but not yet absorbed it."
4,Help for merging churches,"We have bought many copies of this title for our church library and the minister has asked us all to read and study it to help us get through a very difficult church merger. Two aging Methodist churches in our downtown area voted to merge before we agreed on such important issues as which church to keep and who would be the new church officers. I hope no other churches make this mistake, but am counting on this book to help us achieve harmony between factions. There are pointers here that should help us learn to at least ""get along"". Virginia Gleason"
2,"Sorry to be a buzz kill, but...","Yes, the production is fine, but frankly I find little here that interests me. In this recording, she is 56 years old and, if anything, sounds older. If you are already a fan of Ronnie Spector, I'm sure you will enjoy hearing this album. But if you are expecting to hear more of what the Ronettes used to do (and 40-plus years on, that would be an unreasonable expectation), this isn't it. Listen to the samples and make up your mind. I wanted to like the album, but I didn't. (I do think the cover art is excellent, which is partly what attracted me to this EP in the first place.)"
5,A great roadtrip cd,I always take this cd when I go on trips. I find it comforting. Everyone else has pretty much said all I could say so I will just say this. If you like Ronnie and you don't own this you are just foolish...and missing out!
5,Voice of an angel.,"Ronnie Spector (Bennett) still has her trademark voice. This CD was produced by the late Joey Ramone and his influence is easily noticed. I suggest this item to any Ronnie Spector fans or any simple hard rock fans. Her rendition of ""Don't Worry Baby"" is like a lullabye."
4,"a taste of something that could have been so, so great!","Joey Ramone and Ronnie Spector were made for each other. What a perfect match.This is such a wonderful concoction. Don't be surprised, the punk/ new wave acts from the 1970's worshipped the ground of Ronnie Spector. They all loved her.Ronnie should be pushed to do more rock and stripped down musical projects. Her voice is so powerful that she does not need an overproduced and busy sound.""Bye Bye Baby"" a duet with Joey Ramone, ""You Cant put your arms around a memory"" a Johnny Thunders tune, "" this is pure heaven. Every song has the Ronnie Spector trademark sound but with a very contemporary instrumentation.This is a brief 5 song ep. It definetly is not enough but at the same time it wisely makes you crave more from this type of project. Too bad it will never be possible.Joey Ramone really understood Ronnie Spector better than anybody in the last 30 years."
5,"Wow! Purpose, Passion & Abundance","The title says it all. I was amazed at the variety and depth of information in this paperback! As I read through the various stories the theme that kept recurring was that we can heal our bodies, minds and spirits if we seek the answers. I was particularly impressed with Lyne Simon's answer on page 35 and Dean Odmark's solution on page 41. ""Dramatically changed"" and ""determined to find answers"" are phrases that describe most of these authors! I can't imagine anyone who wouldn't be inspired by at least one of the chapters."
5,What a fantastic toy!!,"We got this for my son's first birthday, and it has been the most popular toy ever since...and even with our almost 4 year old. They fight over it...they love the flip up seat to store all of their little cars and other toys. And the gadgets are great! This is a super sturdy toy..both of my boys have stood on it at one time or another..it seems it can hold up to any abuse! The only thing I would change is to perhaps make the back handle fit more snuggly, but this would only be for parents..when I try to pick it up and move it, the handle comes out everytime...but that's no big deal. We love this toy and couldn't be more pleased!"
5,The Best,"I bought this for my 11 month old son when he was learning to walk. He has had so much fun pushing around this toy. He also loves moving around the levers and lifting the seat to put things in and out. Now a month later it is still his favorite toy. Now that he can walk he likes to drag it around as well. When other kids come over to play, they all love it. I really like it because there are no electronic annoying noises and requires no batteries. This toy is a big hit and well worth the money."
5,Grandma's happy,"I sent this train to my 8 mos old granddaughter who was holding on to things as she stood and stepped from thing to thing. She squealed with joy when she first saw it. A month later, she was putting items in it, taking them for a ride (she pushed) and flipping it over to manipulate different colorful parts. Her mother reports she plays with it daily. And, she is just about walking. Riding comes with helpful parents' involvement. It is sturdy enough to be pushed, tipped, pulled and otherwise child-handled. I like the raised red part in the back which parent can hold to assist child's movement and safety."
5,My 18 month old enjoys it!,"This is a toy that my son will go up to on his own, and independently play with. He will get on and off it, ride it around, push it around, open and close the seat compartment to keep toys in it, press the buttons, spin the wheels. There are not that many toys that he voluntarily utilizes to their full capacity without coaxing, but this one he does. I think it is great because it is not electronic, but still stimulates him in many ways, both mentally and physically. Also, I must say, I was very happy to get the blue train that is pictured, but I would prefer if you could pick the color to ensure you are getting the oee you want."
4,An immediate hit,"My son received this as a gift for his first birthday. He is very tall for his age, and is not able to ride it yet (but should be able to soon- his tip toes can touch). He can sit on it and loves to play with the levers and push the button in the front. He also loves to push and pull it as he walks. He is just learning to walk and I do not have concerns about him tipping it over (I did add a weight in the compartment). It is very easy to steer. He plays with it every day and I'm sure will play with it more once he his feet touch the ground. It is a wonderful toy as it entertains him without using batteries or having annoying music."
4,All Aboard,"I usually restrict my purchases to books and educational toys. I bought this for my son's first birthday and it was the hit of the party. Once the newness wore off, I would rate it a 4.5 of 5. My son definitely plays with it daily but it does not keep his attention as well as some of his other toys. I love the storage area in the seat. The wheels don't have a smooth turn when pushing however, I would purchase this again, Enjoy!!"
3,good ride,"My 2.5 year old loves this toy. She rides it all over the basement and driveway and is able to steer it. I bought it for the 1 year old who does enjoy opening up the seat storage and stashing things inside, climbing on and off the seat and playing with the various levers and buttons that make a variety of fun noises. I am sure she will really like it more as soon as she is able to push better with her feet to move it along. My older child has even given her little sister a ride. If you have slim kids, there is enough room for them to both sit on the seat. The seat back support is removeable; it just slides into place with no screws to secure it. This is a little frustrating for the kids, who try to pick up the train by the back support and then it comes off in their hands, leaving them unable to replace it in the ""slots"". That is a minor issue, however."
4,"No assembly, no batteries!","Pros: The only assembly required is attaching the orange-handled backrest. No batteries! Overall, it is a good looking and durable toy.Cons: The backrest is very easy to pull out during play, especially if your little monster is more interested in tossing the train rather than riding on it.I agree with the suggestion of putting weights under the seat to help prevent the train from tipping while your child is learning how to use it, but would also add it is best to use duct or packaging tape to prevent the seat from opening."
5,2 years later.. still a favorite,"This is a great toy; it rides very well, it is sturdy, does not get knocked over, little feet do not get caught by the back wheels (v. important), it carries stuff under the seat, id does not need batteries, it does not have annoying music. It is still in great conditions after two years, two toddlers and tons of play dates. It can also be ridden outdoors. I strongly recommend it."
5,Fun toy!,My niece age 18 months loved this train. It is fun to ride and has things to push and make noises too. How much fun is that for a toddler?
1,Not an interesting toy,"I did extensive review before buying this product. Sadly, my baby never liked it. From the day he was crawling to the time he is a toddler running stable. He used to fall down while pushing it because of the direction control in this car. Then when he is older, it is just not interesting. The kids who come to our house for visit did not like it either. I bought him another item from target a little Disney Micky Mouse cart in the shape of a airplane. It is cheaper than this train and my son likes it a lot. He plays with it all the time. I am surprised at how many people actually like this train. This is the first time the reviews does not match up my experience on amazon."
3,A very adorable riding toy,"I bought this riding train for my grandson who just turned one. He loves to play with it, but does not know how to sit on it and ride it quite yet. However, I am disappointed because the back part of the train does come out too easily. If you try to pick it up by the handle, it just falls out. Otherwise, it is a very colorful toy and does not require any batteries which is always a pleasure when dealing with little ones' toys."
5,MY BOYS LOVE IT,"I bought this for my son when he was 10 months old, he is now 4 and still plays on it, his brother and him push each other around for hours on this thing, they find it to be so much fun.. The only thing that annoys me is the piece your back leans against comes off, so if your going to pick it up, dont use the handle but other then that, I have had this for almost 4 years now and my kids are rough and tough boys and its still in perfect condition.. I have to say though, I thought for the amount of money I paid for it, it would be made better but it holds up VERY well, looks can be deceiving.."
5,Great Toy,We bought this for our 15 month old son after reviewing many different ride-on toys.Immediately our son took a liking to it the first time he saw it and still uses it.Another great thing about this product - No Assembly Required.
3,the publishing market today,"I'm very happy to have received this very old, and probably out of print, volume. It serves my purpose of research as expected.What confuses me is that this narrow little volume would be divided in the printed copy by a haphazardly scrambled version of a ""novel"" admittedly written by a scizophrenic author. I didn't order it...don't want it...and wasn't advised that it would be included in my paperback book.I guess I really don't care, except I paid for the paper and the shipping for something I just don't understand, and really could have done without. A ""novel"" surrounded by my printed order...badly printed at that."
1,Glad it was free,"I got this as a freebie for my Kindle & I'm sooooo glad it was free - I'd have been mad at myself if I'd paid money for this. The plot was a clumsy mess. Kate was irritating, unlikeable and too stupid too live. Cam wasn't much better. In fact, I really didn't like much of anyone in this book & there were plot holes big enough to drive a truck through. I want to say that the motives of the killer were illogical except that really...who **wouldn't** want to kill Kate after spending just a little time with her?? Thank you, Amazon, for giving me the chance to read this for free so I now know to never pay for a book in this series. Now can I get a refund on the hours of my life I wasted reading this drivel? Sigh...."
2,Just boring,After some time you just don't care about the plot. I felt it was really boring (very good before sleep time :-))
4,Suspenseful,"I wasn't sure if I would like this book about a manager of a theater who tries to solve a murder. After all that happened to her, I felt really sorry for her as it went on. The suspense was on until the last minute--couldn't put it down."
1,Not the greatest...,"Based on the average ratings, I expected this book to be better. James Patterson and Patricia Cornwell have nothing to fear from this author. I wish I had my time back. :-("
5,Pretty good,Enjoyed reading an author I hadn't read before. The plot got a little thick but still a really good read.
2,Total suspension of common sense,"Although it is very obvious this author has excellent writing talent, this book needs research on police procedure. For example, the tormentor kept coming to Katie's office where the corridor was videotaped. Yet no one ever asked about or thought to ask about viewing them. No finger prints were ever taken from victim's skin. There were so many loop holes in police procedures; it was ridiculous.I also did not like the heroine. She was very immature, lazy, and silly. At any point in time, she had no clue what she was doing and readers could even guess why.Could have been a wonderful novel with a lot more research."
1,Save your time!,"This book started with promise but swiftly deteriorated to the point where you were almost begging for the heroine to die already! The characters are unbelievable...unbelievably goody-goody, unbelievably stupid and unbelievably dull. Painful waste of time."
3,Break A Leg!,Never gave much thought to what was going on behind the curtain before so now a new appreciation for folks that work behind it all. Probably underpaid and under appreciated.... such is life! (life is art..lol)A very good story that could have been told in half the pages....sometimes it just went on and on and on and such a tease. (if it's not ketchup stuck in a bottle waiting to drop on top of a juicy hamburger...not worth the anticipation!)I like a book that I can put down and can't wait to get back to.... it didn't happen with this one but when I did get back to it I remembered the story and everything that happened before. I guess it is just an everyday kinda going on life read. Maybe your next door neighbor will let you know how her trip to wallyworld turned out!
2,Another idiot woman,"Don't get me wrong, I like fiction where the woman is a strong protagonist - but I don't suffer fools or idiots. When it is obvious someone is trying to kill her does she stay where she is supposed to in her apartment? No - she has to go on a long walk by herself. When she is warned that this one individual doesn't like her and has it out for her does she internalize the warning? No--- she writes him off as a harmless drunk. It's very obvious at the end of this book there is another one coming - I will not be buying it."
2,Disappointing,"Too complicated, hard to read and use. You'll better use "" English Grammar For students of French"" by Jacqueline Morton if you're a beginner English speaker trying to learn French."
4,Peter Michael Hamel - 'Colours Of Time/Bardo' (Kuckuck) 2-CD,"Two early '80's lp's on reissue of Hamel's minimalism/new age work.Very nicely done.Each disc has just two tracks.Each one is about as spell binding as the others.Disc one has ""Colours Of Time,Part 1""(22:05)and ""Colours Of Time,Part 2""(18:04).On disc two,there's ""Bardo""(26:18)and ""Dorian Dervishes""(21:47).Hamel plays keyboard,organ and piano.Might appeal to fans of Stephan Micus,Laraaji,Steve Roach and Markus Stockhausen."
4,Technical manual and dictionary of classical ballet,"Very helpful, ideal for beginners in classical ballet to help learn better the glossary in ballet technique. Thanks so much"
5,Good Material for the Novice Consumer or Experienced Adviser,"An excellent tool for both the novice and ""experienced"" advisor. As one of the very few California Life and Disability Insurance Analysts, he is well qualified to write on the subject and the material reflects that competency."
4,kids table,"We chose this table related to reviews by previous buyers, thus I am writing a review. The previous reviews reported finish durability and good size. So far all is true. It was packed well enough to make it here in its proper pieces. My husband said it was easy to put together. My 5yr old daughter, who recieved it as part of a bedroom 'kitchen,' loved the drawer. Her room is definately the place to be now. We caught her and her 7yr old brother sitting together, getting along, coloring at the table and serving each other ""treats"" several times! It was a decent price and well worth paying to ship it. Thanks to all who previously reviewed- I am glad I trusted the right people! A. Weeks"
1,damaged product,"I am very disappointed, we didn't even get to enjoy the desk because it was shipped to us damaged and then they sent out a replacement desk and that one also came damaged. So now we have two damaged desks. I am very disappointed. My 6 1/2 yr old daughter was very disappointed that we had to return it due to being damaged. Amazon would not send out a replacement desk for the 3rd time so we had to ship back the two damaged desks that we received. We did not reorder this product."
2,Paint on the table won't last,"The table looked very nice and sturdy. But, when my daughter spilled some paint on it and when we tried to remove this with nail polish remover the whole paint came off"
2,Very Disappointing!!,"I recently ordered the white table and four chairs for my daughters for Christmas. It is an adorable set, - BUT - I was VERY DISAPPOINTED when I received the order. I found that the table was cracked and the drawer glides were installed incorrectly, so the drawer can not even be used! Plus, they neglected to send one of the chairs!!I sent an email to the company to explain the problem. They finally sent the chair 2 weeks later, but I still have not gotten a response on the broken table after nearly one month! To make matters worse, the chair they sent had a rotten leg. So it broke the very first time my fifty pound daughter sat on it!!I have once again emailed the company. I hope I get a response this time!! I am tired of making up stories for why Santa and his elves have not taken care of this problem!!!"
2,Surprisingly flimsy,"The table and chairs are nice looking and they are, indeed, solid wood, but it must be some kind of very cheap wood that cracks easily. Two table legs split as as I put the screws in, and I'm not that big or strong -- I'm sure I wasn't applying an extreme amount of pressure. The company sent a replacement leg right away -- maybe this happens a lot. Later, a chair leg cracked when an adult (5'4"" and about 130 pounds) sat on the chair. We sent for a replacement leg and got one that seems to have come from a different chair, because it didn't match the others and didn't fit snugly. Then a leg on the other chair snapped right off when a 40-pound kid stood on the chair. I""m very surprised. I would think that any solid wood that one would choose to make this type of furniture out of should be able to stand the weight of a 40-pound child."
2,"Nice idea, shame about the build quality","The ergonomic design of this mouse has certainly helped my RSI. However, the APPALLING build quality let things down as it broke within just a few months. Considering the high price the quality of the construction is just a bad joke. I am now looking elsewhere for a more robust mouse using the vertical grip design..."
2,Great idea; poor execution,"For the 8 months this device worked, I had complete relief from shoulder and wrist pain from mousing. Unfortunately, from day one, I was disappointed in the quality and feel: the hard, brittle plastic, the clunky button 'action,' and the huge footprint. And it took only six months of reasonable use for the low-quality cable attachment to result in intermittent circuit breaks. For the price paid, I expect a good idea AND reasonable quality. It's still a good idea - too bad the quality of this device is awful."
2,Wrist/arm hurts worse,"i have been using this mouse for a few days now and my wrist hurts more and now my arm hurts too. my hand keeps wanting to rotate back to the standard mouse position. it seems like there is a lot of getting used to for this mouse. you have to retrain yourself. my BIGGEST complaint is that you have to push much harder on the mouse buttons, which is making my shoulder sore. who'd of thunk it?! you also are forced to buy a larger mouse pad (the makers make one that is 8.5""x11"") because it falls off of a standard mouse pad which requires you to pick it up a lot. i returned this one for an EVOLUENT vertical mouse which has no retraining time, and i have been pretty happy with it."
2,Disappointing,"I got one of these to use at work, hoping it would help my wrist issues. I found it uncomfortable to use. The surface is slick and after a minute, my hand felt sweaty using this device. Also, it's very big and clunky and not very responsive. Other people at work use it and like it, so satisfaction varies. It wasn't the one for me."
2,Low quality - too small for hand,The unit shipped to me was defective. The optical sensor wasn't working properly. I returned it for a full refund. The sensor did work partially and I tried to use it for half a day. But the position of the buttons was down near the base of my fingers. I found the buttons very difficult to use. I prefer to use my finger tips for button action.
3,It's weird,"sometimes it helps, sometimes it's more akward. Also, sometimes it jumps & it takes a minute for it to settle down & i have to find it again."
2,Too big for Small Hands,I have small hands and this mouse was way too big for me.Its expensive and i could not try out its look and feel in a store before purchasing. Bought it from The Human solution online store and seemed like it had already been returned once because the package was partly open. There was a 20% restocking fee to return it.
3,Too many duplicates.,"Happy New Year! It's okay cuz too many duplicates. Thought there weren't any duplicates. Otherwise, like the stickers. It's nice. Hope you have a great 2013. Take care."
3,I think Hasbro could have done better.,"Aren't these are supposed to be reviews for toys, not a detailed background of the movie characters? (Referring to other reviews listed above).With that said, the figures detail looks excellent. The Episode III preview figures didn't include action figure stands this time around for some reason and without one, this figure isn't going to stand by himself. You kind of have to prop him upright using his lightsaber. After 10 years of making Star Wars action figures, you think Hasbro would have perfected this by now :("
5,Greatest Enemy Of The Jedi,General Grievous was trained in lightsaber combat by Darth Tyrannus and gained experiece killing Jedi in the Clone Wars. He is 95% droid and 5% alien. He can wield up to 4 lightsabers at one time. He can't use the force. This figure looks good but it should come with 4 lightsabers.
4,Rapol's Grievous Review,"Okay, I saw Grievous in the Cartoon Network 5 min Star Wars Clone Wars and I was like, wow, he's good, he's definitely good, now that's a cool Droid-Alien.And now, Grievous in the very film Star Wars 3.NOTE: I love Star Wars and watched the long and old yet good films of it.Hasbro could have made this figure very durable, because Grievous is the active type of fighter he jumps, he crouches blah blah blah.But especially, they should've added some extra lightsabers, and the cool thing is, he keep a Jedi's lightsaber as a trophy, Is there any is a Sith warrior that does something like that? Grievous is the answer.Grievous is a must-have figure for die hard fans and also for Sith fans. :)"
4,Engaging!,"A story told in teaspoon sized sips, engaging the reader as they long for more of the sweet prose of Miranda Beverly-Whitmore. Although a bit mystical and lofty in her vision, and sometimes getting caught up a little too much on art theory, she does know how to engage the reader. Beverly-Whitmore wrote a beautiful book about art and its effect on everyone who encounters it. As an artist of words, she has created a truly unique masterpiece of her own. Not flawless art, but deep, intriguing, forget the world around you, absorbing art. There is a rhythm and a feeling of this book that I won't soon forget. The author has an amazing ability to draw the reader into her story. Although not the best book I've read recently, I was drawn more into the story of the Wolfe girls than I've been drawn into a story in years. A beautiful first novel."
4,The effects of light,"I loved this book and although it was a great idea of ""Fiction"" I would like to point out that it deeply reflects the work of Sally Mann and I think she should have been acknowledged. If the topic of this book has interested you and you agree that this photography is not even close to pornography as I do, check out Sally Mann's work, it is truly beatiful."
5,Rich and complex - a wonderful and compelling novel,"Beverly-Whittemore has accomplished a great deal in her first novel. The story itself, of two young sisters who are photographed by an artist, is compelling, and the questions raised are complex and challenging. I found the discussions of the role of art in our culture fascinating and provocative, and the story was believable and intriguing. I was ""rooting"" for all the characters! This is the sort of book I can't put down, but whose questions and challenges stay with me!"
3,If you're a sap for another dreamy & haunting story....,"Then this book will suffice. The author does a lot of editorializing on photos & atmosphere. It gets kinda old after the first 70 pages. The philosphy discussed amongst the characters is quite interesting and thought-provoking at times, but the main character really needs to get over herself. When an author leaves mystery, it better be self-evaluating...this story barely misses the mark. I'm very interested in seeing how much she improves with her next book."
2,Not a fan,"Great ideas in the book, but it didn't really engage me. I felt no connection to the characters or emotion. Nothing special. I thought I would be into it having a commercial photo degree, but I didn't. I could imagine how lovely the photos taken by the photographer in the book could be, but nothing more. That's really all I have to say about it. To gauge this better I am a fan of ""Lovely Bones"" by Alice Sebold ""Glass Castle"" by Jeannette Walls, and ""Swimming"" by Joanna Hershon just to name a few."
2,"Good, but flawed","The novel held my interest, although it was wordy and derivative. It repeats an egregious error;The claim that a Lithuanian would have attacked Rembrandt's Danae in Leningrad because of religious zealotry is ridiculous--and ignorant.The date the book gives for the attack is June 15, 1985. The man himself said it was ""out of nationalist protest"" (160).Indeed, June 15th is the day of the first greatest mass deportations of Lithuanians, by Soviets, to Siberia in 1941, a day of mourning (and resistance to oppression) for all Lithuanians to this day.The date is key; the rest, including repeating the theory of zealotry, is ignorant. The man was protesting the cruelty of the USSR by attacking a ""national treasure""; he wouldn't, of course, have slashed religious art."
5,Couldn't put it down...,"Started it in the morning, didn't go to sleep until I finsihed it. A wonderful premise (the backstory of sisters featured in controversial photographs. I was at times moved almost to tears, anger and laughter. Trite perhaps, on my part! It was just a lovely book and I highly recommend it."
5,Works as it should,"I've only used this as wet sandpaper. I've used it on simple paint correction and headlight restoration. It's durable enough for multiple uses and it leaves a fine haze that can be polished out easily with a DA or rotary. I've polished by hand but that takes forever. Either way, the results are as expected and the quality is great. I've had the easiest time if I use a mixture of water and a drop of car wash soap in the spray bottle as lubricant."
4,Good book marred by poor formatting,"This first-hand account of a German soldier's experience of WW I vividly depicts the horrors of war from the perspective of a pacifist, Socialist draftee. I cannot vouch for the accuracy of his description of the German Army of WW I, but it was certainly a harrowing read.The reading experience for me was marred by editing and formatting errors -- there were numerous typos, entire lines of gibberish, and the page headings invariably appeared in the middle of the page. However, if you can tolerate this, I recommend it."
4,Feeling better in OC,"I have 2 children and after years of carrying them began experiencing back pain, a friend sent me this kit and I must say I feel so much better, I have developed a strength in my back that wasn't there before, as well as the benefits to my abdomen, I bought one for my mom"
3,"Great product, funny material","This is a good product to use to stretch your back (really your torso in general if you do all the steps). The fact that it is shaped like a dumbell makes it more stable than a ball. However, the material is more sticky than other fitness balls and one time I leaned it against the wall, and upon separation it took off some paint from the wall. Good design, bad material."
5,Travel with Walter Dean Myers,"Blues Journey briefly explores the blues. Walter Dean Myers prefaces his lyrics with a note about this musical genre. We then travel with the speaker through the sadness that he has experienced over his lifetime. W.D. Myers adds a timeline of blues landmarks and a glossary of blues terms to the end of the book. Walter Dean Myers' son, Christopher, beautifully illustrates this book. This is an excellent title for an introduction to a study of the blues with students fifth grade and up!"
2,well,"I don't know what to say. I was hoping for a really good drum solo because i love this artist. She is inspirational and has a lot of character. Her dances are always fun for me to watch. Maybe it was the rodeo theme, maybe it was the chaps. I feel that she held a lot back when creating this piece. Again, this artist is an inspiration to watch on Youtube and live, but this video didn't give me what i was hoping for. If you are a begginer, i think this is a good place to start. It is cute and may be cute for a very young belly dancer as well."
2,Not so good,"This is truly a book for beginners but for heaven's sake, don't stop here. This will outline terms for you and give you a general idea of what to expect but the biases described in this book should be discarded. For example, they tell you to not lowball an offer in case of offending a seller. Unless you are in the Seller's market, this is just foolishness. Read, talk to your agent, and find a good mortgage broker and ask questions. Save your money and time for your closing costs. This book won't cut it for you."
5,"inexpensive, durable creative fun","We bought these as a stocking stuffer for our 4-year-old son this Christmas. He has fun creating things with them, and they don't get used up. You don't have to put them away specially like play-doh, either. They're small and easy enough to bring along on trips for entertainment."
3,Small packs,Small pack for the cost. I have bought in stores before and it was a larger pack for the same cost. The quality seems OK.
4,Perfect stocking stuffer!,"My son loves Wikki Stix - they're such a neat way for kids to be creative! I do wish this package had a few more stix in it, but as it is, it's a perfect stocking stuffer. The colors are nice and vibrant, and sure to provide hours of fun!"
2,Such a stupid problem!,Ok I like the Idea and for the most part it is great. Now for the problem I had. The threads were not finished or not formed correctly. I first ran a tap through the hole and this did not help. I then had to get a 1/4 20 Die and fix the bolt threads. I tried returning it but it was back ordered and I am going on my trip tomorrow.It works now but I wanted to return it so they had to pay a little price for there cheap manufacturing and overpriced bracket. I wish they had a small QA department and did not use customers.Robert
2,"Pretty, But not Ergonomic","This is pretty common lately. It's a pretty trowel, but unless you have hands shaped like half-moons it's not so easy to grip efficiently. Trowels should provide utility, not attractive good looks."
3,Not as great as I was hoping it would be...,"It looks like a VERY comfortable trowel to use... and it is, but not in the conventional way. My biggest gripe about this trowel is that the blade clogs-up with wet or clayey soil faster than just about any other trowel I have ever used. You constantly need to stop and wipe soil out of the creases, both top and bottom. Also, the curved handle is really only comfortable it you turn the trowel backwards and use the """"jab and pull"" method of digging. Used forwards, you are going to get a blister (or 2) in no time flat."
4,The Best Garden Trowel ever -almost,"The shape and design of this tool is perfect for orienting one's hand and arm for maximum leverage and from multiple angles around the radius of the handle. The weight is very light, but it is very strong. I agree with another reviewer's lament about the green handle. I lose it easily in the garden and am here today to buy a replacement, so earns a 4 out of 5. A bright Yellow, Orange or Red would solve the problem. All of the radius tools I have tried such as the stainless steel garden spade have proven to be functionally superior."
4,Nice,"This is the only performance I have of this piece, but I like it. Is it perfect? No. Is it worth listening to? Yes. Was the price an OUTSTANDING value? YES!"
3,It's OK but a little heavy with regulations and light on content and examples,This book is OK. I am sure I will get some use out of it but it is a little heavy with information on regulations and light on content and examples.
5,Perfect for what I need,"I was looking for something just for music and my boyfriend told me about this player. I not only have it for my favorite music, but you can also listen to FM stations. I've not added any videos but it does also have the option. Very simple to use. Connect it to your computer and add your music....Done and Done!!!"
1,DO NOT BUY PLEASE,"This is a total piece of junk, whoever gave this a good review is wrong. My computer could not recognize it for NOTHING and it could not load any music, it was pure frustration. My husband has a Coby and it is soooo straightforward and easy to load musics. IT WILL BE RETURNED THAT IS A GUARANTY"
2,Not a good toaster,"We've owned this toaster for about a year now. I'm not sure why I've put up with it this long. It is completely inconsistent. We keep the knob between 2 and 3 and do not move it. At this setting, sometimes the toast gets completely burnt (like this morning), sometimes we get warm un-toasted bread, and sometimes it comes out perfectly (why I give it two stars instead of one star). There is also no consistency between the two sides of the toaster. Both sides will be set between 2 and 3 and will be pushed down at the same time. One side will come out burnt to a crisp while the other will be done nicely. If you want a toaster that only occassionally gives you good results at unpredictable times, this is for you."
1,Proctor silex toasters,"I don't have this exact toaster but I have a 2-slice Proctor Silex toaster. it has been nothing but problems since I got it last christmas. The wires that hold the toast away from the heating elements are way too wide apart allowing small pieces of toast to fall in between, the handle you push the toast down with feels very cheaply made and flimsy, and crumbs fall out the bottom on to the table it is sitting on. Also, it doesn't toast at all evenly. Don't buy a Proctor Silex!"
2,Not Impressed,I don't know what all the good reviews are about. We haven't had the toaster long and one side is broken and it is hard to clean. And it doesn't toast evenly without burnt edges on english muffins. For the price not such a good buy in my book
4,Just what we needed!,"I bought this toaster to save time while toasting several waffles and bagels at once. I like it so much that our poor toaster oven is gathering dust in the corner. I saw all the awful reviews, and while it is a little on the flimsy side, it performs perfectly and makes getting breakfast for the whole family a snap. I don't know how I made it all these years without one. LOVE IT!"
3,Mine worked fine,"I had this toaster for a year, and it worked very well. (well the first few times it had a funny smell to it... like plastic melting or something). But certainly never anything close to a fire hazard or even an uneven toasting. Keep in mind I purchased mine close to two and a half years ago. It sounds to me like Proctor-Silex has gone a bit downhill to me. Personally haven't owned one that worked fine, I would probably find myself a better rated toaster here on amazon. Not really worth the risk is it?"
1,Thumbs down for this product,"While I expected this dual-slotted toaster to provide additional flexibility when compared to a ""typical"" toaster, it couldn't even handle the basics properly. Issues included:(1) Regular slices of bread heat unevenly. This apparently has to do with the bread holders being positioned too close to one heating element and too far away from the other (i.e., not centered).(2) The heat settings are inexact and inconsistent. At ""3,"" I would get a warm piece of bread. At ""4,"" one burned side and one warm side. And that was only for one of the two toaster slots - the two slots never seemed to heat ""in unison.""(3) They should call this model ""The Crumb Factory"" - if you like to wipe up crumbs, just pick up your toaster. They fall everywhere.I have generally liked Proctor-Silex products, but I must say this one is a no-buy. It failed us - we just gave it away (I'd feel too guilty trying to resell it!)."
4,Pretty good book,I have read all of her series and have found them enjoyable. Well written and I defenitly did not fall asleep. I like decent clean stories about normal people. Good plot and well written. I recomend it.
4,Mckaslin family,"Good book. I really liked both of the main characters. I like that they had known each other forever, but still a relationship formed."
4,Common Sense Stuff Here,"A pretty easy read, full of useful hints. Dr. Jarvis' writing style is down-to-earth. I enjoyed the fact that it was not full of medical jargon, and contained quite a lot of anecdotal evidence to support his claims. I will definitely keep this book as a reference."
3,It this all there is in this book...really? It needs a good editor...,"I was SO juiced and psyched to get this book. Then it came. What? Small...sorta fits in your back pocket. Then...I started to read it. All I could says was...""Someone needed to edit it."" It would have read better, been less redundant, and maybe even sport a cleaner typeface.I bought it for what other reviewers said it had about castor oil. There is hardly anything about castor oil in it...including the castor packs, how to make them and what to use it for.Disappointed!There also seems to be some conflicting info with honey and kids. I will have to type out what I can glean from that book and look for one that has been better written with more down home remedies.Why did this get 5 stars???"
4,I HAVE A QUESTION,Does anyone know anything about eating tree leaves like he mentioned in chapter 7. never read anything else about it. if so write me at iatethecloudsforyou at gmail.com
3,folk medicine,The book is interesting for it goes back many years and today there are articles for sale with the same idea of honey and applecider to heal.Have tried the honey but not the cider and the results not sure yet.Tom-MA.
1,dissatisfied,"I thought this book was very archaic, the information had no real research to back it up. It was silly."
4,Dad was right!,"For all the advances in medical knowledge, many home health/healing practices ring true through the years. My Dad swore by his daily vinegar and honey routine. Re-reading Folk Medicine after 50 years brings me new understanding of Dr. Jarvis' observations."
5,The perfect kindergarten for a classical music education,"""Hooked on Classics"" is a very important album to me. I began listening to it, on vinyl, when I was five or six years old. I bought my first ""whole"" album when I was about twelve (it was Gershwin). I am twenty-two, and currently using Amazon.com to search for a lot of the music I came to know from ""Hooked..."" I don't think I'd be the same person, artistically, if it weren't for my introduction to classical music with this album.Sure, some people may resent the electronic, metronome beat that keeps most of the music on the same rhythm, but I don't. For me, I liked the way dozens of different suites, overtures, and symphonies were assembled brilliantly into nine tracks. If there are seams showing, I can't see them."
4,A Helpful Resource,"I believe that this book contains very helpful insights and advice on coming home. Several years ago I came home from an overseas assignment with little or no help--it was a nightmare. I wish I'd known then what I know now. This time, I'm planning my overseas return in a few months. Using suggestions in the book along with my own personal experience I expect a much better transition. P.S. I've given a copy to my Human Resources VP in the home office to help her have some insights regarding employees who make this transition."
4,We Use This as a Tool with Our Global Repatriation Program,"As part of our year-long repatriation process, we (a global consulting firm) provide a copy of this book to all of our associates on cross-border assignments. Assignees often don't realize the ""culture shock"" and problems they and their families will face when returning to their home country. The book is written in a ""reader-friendly"" format and the feedback we've received from our ""expats"" has been very positive."
4,Good music bad background vocals,The title says it all. I bought this for someone else so can't say much more about it.
5,You did it again Candace Camp,"I love to read stories with strong chracters. Here comes Alexandra, a strong, determined, and outspoken American who is a business owner in a man's world. She meets Sebastian (Lord Thorpe). He is intriqued by this beautiful American and can't believe that she is what she appears to be. Is she really the busines owner she claims? Is she really the good hearted and honest woman that he wants to believe in? There are a lot of twists and turns in this delightful romance. It keeps you guessing up until the end who is good and who isn't so good. Have a fun time visiting Regency England."
3,or 3 & 1/2 -- good but hardly great,"A Stolen Heart is an interesting read with both romance and intrigue. Intelligent, forthright, capable Alexandra finds herself immediately attracted to her new, somewhat reclusive business partner, Lord Thorpe. Then she finds herself repeatedly in danger. As they try to unravel the mystery--a mystery that includes her real identity and his doubts about her true purpose and trustworthiness--their attraction just grows.Sometimes this book is thoroughly entertaining; other times it stretches credulity. Sometimes the characters & situations seem vital and fresh; other times it seems a rehash of every romance ever written. All-in-all, it's an enjoyable read, but there are moments of disappointment and frustration. While decent, it's not one of Camp's best. Perhaps it's just too farfetched at times; perhaps there's not enough character development.Ii enjoyed it, but wouldn't buy it."
4,cant find #2 in series,can anyone tell me the name of the # 2 book in the lost heirs series cannot seem to find itthanks
1,Useless,"This is NOT a reprint of Macdonell's Reader! Only a fraction of his work is reproduced here, and none of the important parts are included. The actual READER is missing! There are no hymns, not even just the translations, and there is no commentary or glossary. What's the point of a Vedic reader without any Vedic text?It's a completely useless waste of paper and is being returned immediately."
5,step famlies helper,This book helps step parents to see where they fit in and how the dynamics of the family changes with new members. I have lent this book to other families living in step.
5,WONDERFULL TAPE,I WAS SO HAPPY TO GET THIS TAPEIT IS REALLY FUNNY WITHOUT USING ANY FOUL LANGUGAGEI WOULD LOVE TO FIND THIS IN A DVD
3,Funny scenes w/ too much corny singing,"There are a few scenes that are hysterical. The drunkin santa selling Christmas trees and the rich old bastard calling Freddie and his crew riff-raff at the restaurant. Outside of that, it's more or less unwatchable."
1,"almost as bad as ""step it off 1""","I have been taking step classes for many many years, generally 2 - 3 times a week -- so I am not new to this. That said, this is one of the worst exercise videos I have ever seen (along with ""Step It Off 1"" by the same instructors). The instructors call the steps the first time through, then proceed to chatter perkily while they go through the routine again -- rarely saying what steps are coming up! They do a tiny bit better with this in this DVD than in ""Step It Off 1"", but not by much) Naturally, I am lost after the first few minutes. Even worse, they add on all sorts of jumps, turns, ""fancy dance moves"", and then proceed to not call those either. If you are a dancer, perhaps you will be able to follow these instructors, but I sure couldn't follow them. A complete waste of money."
3,It's not easy,"and I had to watch the whole dvd first to do it, and still, the steps are not easy to learn. I have to admit, I am bad at learning complicated choreographies, and I honestly don't really want to learn them in the first place (I want to work out without having to think about complicated step combos). So I am modifying the steps to keep up with them, and that works out just fine for me. It is a great cardio workout, once you get used to it."
4,a great read in the genre,"First, to be fair, this is my kind of book. It's a guy book. Not that women would not enjoy it (strong female character), but it's about men- bonding, trust, flying, loving, losing, joy and despair. About being a man, a soldier, a husband and a father. Corny? Perhaps. Could I pick at the book because it's sentences are a little awkward or simplistic? And using flashbacks works well on the screen, but for me (read: village idiot) not too well in books with multiple characters. But that's like avoiding road racing because the harness wrinkles your clothes. I started this book on a Thursday night one chapter, Friday night, another, and woke up with the flu on Saturday. And read the rest of the entire book.It's one of those books that once you are finished you begin to wonder how another book will hold your interest. All of a sudden all the books you were thinking of reading next become, well, tarnished.I had a great time, thanks for the ride!"
5,This is a MUST for every music-lover's collection!,"This newest Windham Hill release has become an instant favorite. It is just one of those records that you want to keep playing over and over. The selections are a combination of original compositions and well-known works, and it is hard to decide which numbers are more captivating. The violinist, Tracy Scott Silverman, has got to be one of the most talented performers and composers to come on the scene in a long time. Hope to hear lots more from him in the future. My advice to anyone looking for a ""can't miss"" purchase - don't miss this one!"
2,Trip to the Sun,"I usually really enjoy listening to Tracy Silverman. This one just wasn't his best; it didn't move me too much. A couple songs were pretty good, but nothing to compare with what he currently does."
3,"Excellent quality, Bad Style","While missing an index is a somewhat minor fault in a ""non-technical"" book such as this, it is hard to forgive the publisher/author for using such small type. This book is difficult to read in the best of situations. It also uses a paper of high grade glossiness, which looks really great, but makes the book about 2x heavier than it should be for a guide. Essentially, as long as you don't take this book with you on your hikes, it has everything you will need for hiking the canyons."
5,Best guide for the SW,I have used versions of this book for 20 years and it has led me to some wonderful places. The instructions are usually thorough but occasionally I can't find the place.
1,Non-Technical Canyon Hiking Guide to the Colorado Plateau,This book is impossible to read as the interline space is nonexistent. In the end I decided to return it.
1,A dangerous book,"Kelsey's directions to trailheads is seriously lacking in this book. I followed his directions to a trailhead in Zion National Park, and ended up in the totally wrong canyon. This was after following his directions and mileage points to the letter!"
2,A Lot of Information of Spotty Quality,"I really like this book, but I take it with a big chunk of salt. It has information about hikes all over the Colorado Plateau, from Zion to the Res to Grand Junction, and this is its big win - variety. A few classic canyons in each area.But the information is not always accurate. Bring the map, a pack full of common sense and read with skepticism, and you'll be just fine. Be a beginner, take this as the bible and you're heading for trouble."
1,Colorado Plateau Hiking to Nowhere,It was recommended to buy this book for my hike to Grand Gulch.And the was little to nothing in this book on such hike.
2,May fall apart after a few adjustments,"I like the idea of an add on light for the gameboy which doesn't require an external power source. However, two things really changed my perception of this item when I finally got my WormLight.First, the light can give off an annoying glare when it hits the screen. It was next to impossible to adjust the lamp to get rid of the glare while maintaining sufficient lighting.All that adjusting led straight to my second problem, durability. After several adjustments, the wiring at the base of the connector became undone, causing the light to get no power and to be limp when attached to the Gameboy.The WormLight did not last even an hour. This item may be a bit too fragile for some. If you must buy this, do be careful."
2,Sometimes Looks Can Be Deceiving...,"I bought this exact light (same color and everything) and was extremely dissapointed with it. It puts out very little light and the glare is terrible. I bought it for my Game Boy Advance and I know it was made for Game Boy Color, but it barely lights up a third of the screen! It looked like a good deal (price and all), but it really isn't worth a dime. I suppose it is better than playing in pitch black, but not much better."
2,Barely better than playing in the dark.,"Yeah, it is pretty funky looking...but don't be fooled. Although this light is adjustable...it is very difficult to adjust the light so that it does not glare on the playing screen. It seems that no matter which way I focus the light its glare is so bad that I can only see part of the screen.I like that you don't need an extra power source, but I've noticed that my batteries run down very quickly. I also like that you can select a worm light to match the color of your game boy, but color coordination isn't everything.If you're stuck in the dark somewhere, then this worm light may work for you. However if you have a lamp near by (or a map light which most cars have) you will probably be happier just using the light available to you. The glare doesn't make it worthwhile.Caveat emptor! Happy gaming."
3,"Nifty design, but somewhat annoying glare","Neat, almost artistic design is great, but unfortunately, there is a severe glare on the gameboy screen. One advantage is the fact that you don't need seperate batteries...the thing runs off the gameboy batteries. However, this is also a disadvantage, due to the reduced battery life of the gameboy's batteries."
2,"Abuses the viewer at the ""end""","It started out good, and stayed good all the way to nearly the end. Oh wait, I'm sorry, I forgot, there WASN'T an end. I could got into detail about it why it was such a waste of time, but it's really very simple. When it was over I was left feeling ripped off. Not in a monetary sense since I saw it on cable. Rather, my time and my emotional and psychological investments were abused."
1,Great build up---to nothing,"This film was expertly made and filmed. Great tension and very dramatic acting. What ruined it for me was there was not an explanation at the end. We know they wife was killed by accident, but why? Who? What was the cover up? No questions were answered, and that made me feel like my time was wasted on a good looking movie, poorly written end. Not satisfying at all.To me, if you make the best looking film out there, and it doesn't make sence, you're not a good film maker."
2,Very wierd and different,"This movie was very wierd and different to me. What I was seeing was the mental breakdown of the husband who's wife was murdered. If you look at the movie in that aspect, it could be very interesting. Other than that, the movie didn't make much sense. The ending was an odd ending too.SPOILER ALERTThere wasn't any resolution to the ending. For me, it was just a cover-up of the police force that was getting rid of crooked cops and the wife was an ""innocent"" that was killed by accident. If you are into different and in an ""indifferent"" mood then this movie is for you. Otherwise, try another movie."
1,very bad. Goes nowhere.,"From the box, it sounded kind of cool. Plus, John Turtorro is one of the best actors ever. Could he be in anything that sucked? Yes he can. And this was it. Don't get me wrong, he was great, he couldn't have done better. But what can even the best actor do with such a crack-smoking script? Nothing notable in this movie. Not worth renting. Too bad. Had potential...And by the way, that other review wasn't kidding about the over a minutes worth of just random red driblle on the screen. And after that, the thing just went to poop. Don't keep waiting for something to happen because nothing does. If anything, it starts out with nothing happening, and then as the movie goes on, MORE nothing happens. It's like how much more nothing could happen, and the answer is none more nothing :)"
2,"NICOLAS WINDING REFN, OPUS 3",The influence of Stanley Kubrick and David Lynch is manifest in Nicolas Winding Refn's third film. One might say that FEAR X is a bizarre film well photographed. I liked the first part of the film focusing on John Turturro's obsessional minimum life. The last part can be forgotten. It's clearly the film of a young director who still didn't know where to go exactly. A DVD zone completists. Only.
1,HORRIBLY BORING MOVIE,"A guy's wife gets murdered for seemingly no reason, and he gets extremely obsessed to find her killer and ask why he did it. Sounds kind of interesting; by looking at the cover you think this but this is one of the most boring movies I have ever seen. I had a VERY hard time staying awake, and I had to watch this twice because I had such a hard time staying awake, fighting off yawning. ULTRA BORING. So what happens? Well, you are not sure and it ends. It's very stupid how it just cuts off and ends. I rented this movie and even then I felt ripped off. LAME STUPID MOVIE BIG TIME. Not even worth one star. NOT EVEN WORTH RENTING!"
2,Confusing and slow,Fear X is a slow attempt at film noir. In the end it's just cinfusing and you'll be asking yourself what happened.
2,all style,"potential yes. reminds me of poetry that relies only on gloomy atmosphere. the atmosphere rates 5 stars. the script is a zero though. a complete damn zero. perhaps these clever film makers need a bit of a story teller to help. reality check, guys.i'm with everyone else who wrote boring, etc, etc."
3,Movie goes nowhere--rental only,This is one of those slow movies that literally go nowhere. The plot is rather hard to follow and the movie is very slow and hard to understand. John Tuttaro is good and outshines the other players. Suggest only rental---
4,Great education for every employee.....,"From all the points covered in the book, ""Management Malpractice How to Cure Unhealthy Management Practices That Disable Your Organization"" is a very informative book. All individual in any organization should be introduced to these common practices. Knowing and learning how to identify these practices will be beneficial to an employee in understanding the various intricate communications and practices taking place in an organization' environment."
4,"Looks great, setting the date is a pain","This watch looks great, very sharp and classy. The face is kind of big, better suited if you have a larger than average wrist.My only complaint is setting the date. Since this watch has both day and date, getting it set up correctly is confusing, and the directions don't help much. But once you get it, it looks and works great.Note - the hands are ""glow in the dark"". I didn't realize this until one day I was out in the sun for a while and came into the dark garage and saw the hands lit up. Not sure how useful it is (since the watch has indiglo), found it odd, but doesn't hurt anything."
1,It was broken on arrival!,I was very disappointed to see that the day and date dials do not work on this watch. It is stuck between Tues and Wed on the 5th. Local dealer would have been easier to exchange.
2,My ants must not like peanut butter.,"These baits are peanut butter-based, as it says on the can. The ants I have seem to be drawn to sugary things, but they leave these baits alone. I'm going to try another type; I know some ants are drawn to some traps so I think it's mostly a matter of trying different kinds until I find one that these particular ants like to eat."
1,Does not attract ants into it.,"The ants (very small ones) seem uninterested in the bate and run right by it, completely uninterested. Get boric acid/sugar baits instead. Note: A large container of boric acid was only $4 at OSH (hardware store). Search online for how to make boric acid ant bait."
1,Doesn't Work,"This was a waste, I watched the ants walk all around the can but were not attracted by it. I gave it a week and nothing!!! I got Terror T300 and problem solved. The ants are gone...."
1,Does not work at all,"We tried these baits over the past two weeks and seem to have far more ants now than we did before. These baits are absolutely worthless. We live in the Pacific Northwest, so maybe the ants are different?"
1,Doesn't work,I've tried this one year. Bought the 3 traps and placed a fresh one out every few months. The ant problem never went away.
1,MADE OUT OF PEANUT BUTTER!,My daughter is allergic to nuts. Just in case the little critters track peanutbutter into the house I couldn't use it. Anaphylaxis to nuts is no laughing matter. Waste of money. Gave it to my gardener just to get it out of the house.
2,Stay away from this one....,"I wish I had read the other review of this product here before buying this toy. ... We bought this toy a few days ago for my 9 month old. It looks great, but I really think it's poorly designed for actual use. We had my son in the car with the safety bar on and the handle attached for me and my husband to push him around. ... the handles are too pliable and bend and this makes it very difficult to turn the car. I also agree that the toy is too low to function as a walker, and sitting in the car my son's feet drag too low. BUT THE WORST PART was that when we stopped pushing my son around and let him play in it with the musical box in front (which is very nice) he turned sideways or twisted around to look at us (we were a couple of feet away) and he and the car fell over sideways and my son came crashing down and landed on his HEAD on our tile floor. We are very careful and this is the first time my son has ever had a fall of this kind. I am returning this toy today."
2,Too expensive & Too flimsy,"This toy seems to have many features but the features are poorly incorporated and make it difficult for a child to use. I have purchased and have been pleased by other Chicco products but this toy is anything but pleasing. The car is very cute but on closer inspection you can see that it is very flimsy. The car is made for children six months to three years but my average size fourteen month old is almost too big for the car. My son was able to detach the safety bar while he was sitting in the car. The tall handles that and adult uses to push the car bend easily. When the base was attached the car barely rocked. When I tried to push my son in the car we couldn't get very far because the footrests are at an awkward angle, so he would end up trying to stretch his legs and his feet would stop the car. It is also too low and light to use as a walker (when my son tried it tipped over.) Overall, I found that this car tries to do too much. Unfortunately, it does nothing well."
2,Poorly Designed and Too Expensive,"I wanted to bring my 8-month-old son out to ""ride bikes"" with the other neighborhood kids. Chicco stated this rider was made for children 6 months to 3 years of age; apparently, the designers never actually put a small child in it. My son's feet slide off the front and back of the footrests and either drag on the ground or get pulled under the footrests. I find myself constantly looking to see if his feet are clear of the ground. Other than that, he loves riding in it; although, sometimes if he leans too much to one side or the other, I am afraid the car will tip over. Maybe it will work better once he's older...I would NOT recommend this rider, and if I could, I would return it."
2,Very Dangerous! Don't Buy,My 10 month old got this toy for Christmas. It looked like a great toy that would last a long time. When we put the baby in it he seemed to love it. Beware! I was standing right next to the baby when he tried to look at something on the floor and it fell over. He landed on his head! I will never buy this brand of toy again. It was obvious that no one had tested this toy on young babies and it was very cheaply made.
2,Poorly designed,My son got this as a gift. When I first saw this I thought it was a great toy. The first time we tried to use it as a push toy we had problems with the wheels. They do not turn unless the steering wheel is turned which can't be done with the tray on it. The tray keeps the steering wheel locked. So we let him use it as a riding toy and every three feet when he shifted his weight he tipped over. We also tried to use it with the base as a keep the baby stationary toy. Every time he leaned to either side and touched the tray it popped off. The only thing we have been able to use on this toy is the keyboard from the tray. It's a great car seat and stroller toy that can be purchased separately for fewer than twenty dollars. I am sorry that my friends have spent so much money on a toy that is basically a disappointment.
1,DANGEROUS!!!!!!!,"Don't buy this. Please read the reviews for this toy. My son received this toy as a gift. I assembled it according to the (quite brief and poorly written) instuctions. On his first try, my son leaned a bit to one side, the saftey barrier came loose and he crashed on the ground. So much for 'saftey.' I then looked up the toy on Amazon to check out the reviews. Sure enough, this has happened to many, many others. This is a very poorly designed toy. Too low to the ground to be a real ride-on toy, and too flimsy to be a rocker. My daughter has a different Chicco ride-on toy that has been great. I don't know how this one got onto the market!"
1,Don't buy it!,"Where do I start? We got this for our 12 month old twin boys and were excited about all that it was ""purported"" to be. Upon assembly, it was painfully obvious that this was not a high quality item. It is extremely flimsy - the boys are able to actually lift up the safety bar section because it does not adhere adequately. They do enjoy sitting in it and playing with the activity center - for about 5 minutes. One of the boys pulled up on it and promptly fell because the activity center is not attached / locked in to the car. The ""rocking"" is a joke, the instructions even worse then that. We haven't even attempted to take this off the carpet so I can't review the other features. We are very disappointed with this product and are extremely grateful we didn't buy two of them."
1,"Unsafe, bad design, not as advertised","My daughter, who is now 18 months, and is fairly tiny for her age was getting stuck every time i tried to lift her out of this thing (she recieved it as a gift about 6 months ago). I was so disappointed. You can't really turn it, and it is not durable enough to take outside the house. Every time my daughter tried to move, she would get stuck and hurt her legs. it sits very low to the ground, making it difficult for her to pedal along the ground. Tips over easily.Buyers beware! Really, really study this product before purchasing!"
1,Topples Over,I would not recommend this car as my young son has toppled out of it on more than one occassion. It is not very sturdy and the handle comes out easily. We we were sorry we purchased it. The only good thing about it is the removable musical acitvity keypad.
4,Loved this one!!,"I don't really agree with most of the reviews on this toy, I bought it for my son and he loved it, you just have to keep an eye on the children so they wont hurt them and not be so careless with them so they wont fall over!"
5,I read lots of travel books and I loved this one!,"Shanebrook's book is a fantastic read! What a relief to read a travel book that isn't so damn boring! I loved all the stuff about modeling and it was exciting to read about Asia. I've done lots of travelling and normally only read the mainstream guides, but it was great to get an insider's take. I found some great restaurants in Thailand, and have recommended the book to my friends who not only like to travel, but like to have fun. People who travel like adventure, normally, and anybody who likes adventure will loves this book. Great photos!"
3,Flaws in this tool,I use this tool mainly for making brick moulding profiles. As recieved I found the screw that holds the dies in place keep falling out or would screw itself so tight it would jam the dies. I had to install a flat washer to act as a thrust bearing and apply Loc-Tite blue to the screw. The way the case is moulded requires you to have to spend time screwing the dies in or out to get it into position to use it each time. And time is money.
3,A good children's book,"The Secret of the Fourth Candle is a well written story about a poor native girl in North Africa who sees Advent candles in the home of her mother's employer. The vision of the candles overcomes the girl with joy. While older readers, such as myself, may not find the book the least bit riviting, parents will find the story interesting, and will not be too bored while reading it to their kids."
5,"Entourage, the best show on TV","This show is smart, funny, and fun. I had seen all the episodes before I bought the DVD, but they never get old."
2,Prodigious Piven / Boring Boys,"I found that your enjoyment of Entourage.2 is proportional to how much you A) savor a good tabloid read, B) trust in cool product placements, C) love celebrity cameos and D) yearn for more insider trivia on IMDB. After enjoying the first season, I wanted more from this group. But season 2 gave me the sensation of eating too much cookie dough. Everyone is so beautiful and the music is so good, and gosh, the celebrity cameos are really just the best! Dreams of Laker games, beach parties at Jamie Pressly's house, and Sundance sustain me in times of grief and pain. Thank god I waited for this on video. I found myself fast-forwarding through the same endless weed drenched I-can't-get-la*d rich white boy whining just to get to Piven - who blows everyone away. Piven and the absolute skewering of Harry Knowles barely save this thing from being this decade's equivalent to 90210."
1,be still my lunch,"I had hoped to put in -0- stars, but sadly it wasn't an option.At any rate, it was shows like these that ushered the brilliant ""Carnivale"" to it's grave. This show was a giant mistake on HBO's part, I was disgusted by how dull it was in comparison to the other great shows such as Six Feet Under, Rome and(as mentioned before)*Carnivale.I grieve for fans of Entourage after knowing the other great entertainment that dwarf it."
4,The Story Continues,The characters start to get comfortable in their skins and you start to see the dynamic evolve. Vince’s career starts to take off and the whole gang is enjoying it. Vince is becoming more convincing as a genuinely good guy and true friend.
5,Very Beautiful,The cor anglais is a most beautiful instrument and evokes the image of nature awakening to me. This conceto does that to me perfectly.
2,"Great polishing pads, horrible polish","Good thing I really only bought this kit for the extra arbor and polishing pads because the polish that is included is just worthless.The three different pads provide three different grades of polishing, heavy, medium. and light. Yes the kit comes with two ""light"" pads, but I use one for the medium cut stuff, then use the other one for the finish work. Seems to work very well for me.I actually tried the compound that came with the kit, that was a waste of time and effort. Stick with polish/compound that actually works, such as Simichrome, BlueMagic, Flitz, or Mothers.For the price, you're better off buying the polishing pads and arbor separately and not even bother with this kit.Pros:Great pads.Cons:Bad polish."
2,mediocre,"i was hoping for a more distinctive sound. really it sounds very generic country neither interesting lyrics not music. If youre looking for a 'find' or 'a striking new' artist atleast for you, then i doubt that this will be it."
2,parts were ok,"I have to admit, I did not like this book. While parts were ok, on the whole it failed to grab me and entirely failed to satisfy. Random memories with little semblance of order, all dramatized a bit too much.The story line has a lot of potential, but the presentation needs a lot of work."
4,Not the rap act! This is the heaviest mellow...,"you'll ever hear. It goes from Kyuss-bass overload Panzer division crush to fuzz headrush to light and trippy clean electric stuff, and then back. The songs are free-form and organic, building into new sections slowly and steadily. More like one long song with dozens of variations. This is a fantastic CD, just as good if not better than their previous. Highly recommended."
4,It fits perfectly.,"This is the original filter, nothing special, does the job, After I bought it found it for 40% less :-(( shop around, and you will find much better deals."
3,Returned for Jamie Oliver,"I returned this nice, small, overpriced, porcelian ""mug"" for a comfortable, also porcelain, Jamie Oliver mug that helps me start my mornings. See my other Jaime Oliver review for further information."
2,NO LYRICS ON THE SCREEN!!!,This is not a CD with graphics on the screen. :( I didn't like it...Sorry.
4,"Review of ""Jaguar""""","This book is essential reading for anyone interested in the Central American Rainforest. It has a little bit of everything..field notes, natural history, local culture, paranormal experiences, adventure, and romance. The book was engaging and easy to read. I learned a lot about jaguars and the struggle to protect them. The only drawback was Rabinowitz's negative portrayl of the present day Mayans. Undoubtedly, the author is a scientist and not an anthropologist, but i do feel that he should have shown more respect for their culture and more understanding of their situation.I reccomend this book, and then i reccomend traveling to Cockscomb Basin in Belize to fully appreciate the conservation effort. Even if you can't get there, you will feel like you have been there after reading this book."
1,Machismo in the Bush,"Not a trace of humility here, nor any sense that there were consequences for the people who lived in the Coxcomb basin, who were thrown out so the author could pursue his goals. Conservation as a macho story about the white man."
5,Is this product factory made.,"Purchased this product not knowing what to expect. I usually leave the automotive purchases to the local parts store or in this case, the dealer. Preformed hoses are so dificult to get right, especially aftermarket. I'm happy to say the item looked like OEM, and the quality appears to be just as good as factory. Saved over 2/3 the cost of dealer pricing. This is one happy camper."
3,Freddy Kruggar in a van?,"Stephen King is my favorite author, but I must say, none of his books have been this bad, even Pet Semitary. I read the first half and became bored to death. There were sixty-billion characters, all impossible to keep track of. It is incredibly violent. Deaths are expected in any of King's books, but I thought they were all distasteful and graphic. The story reminded me of a slasher film with Freddy in colorful vans. It was a good story and everything fit together, but it didn't appeal to me."
4,A very imaginative story,"I'm a little baffled by all the lackluster reviews I'm reading about this book. While not perfect, it is a very good novel. It has more imagination than the last 5 books I've read combined. So much in the horror field today is the same thing I read ten years ago. I've never read anything quite like this. Also, King keeps feeding you little bits of information so you never completely figure out the whole story until he's ready to reveal it. Others have said it's too bloody and gory. While there is violence and blood, it is driven by the story and I have read alot worse. The biggest complaint I would make is that like 90% of King's books its too long. Apparently editors don't edit anymore."
4,Pretty good King effort,"I read this book after reading Desperation and was glad I did. Although this is an entertaining thriller that holds your attention, it is the lesser of the two books. This book reads like an interesting short story expanded to a full length book. I'm surprised it hasn't been commissioned to become a t.v. movie or feature film, because the writing style used here by King certainly lends itself to translation to either of those genres. I recommend it as an entertaining read, but if possible read Desperation first."
4,Goodish....by far not his best,"It had some good scenes in it, but one should really think whether King and Bachman are the same person. While King writes superb stories, like Pet Sematary and The Shining, Richard Bachman gives us this..and what IS this? It is basically showing that the King of horror may be abdicating his throne to the likes of another author. Another thing I want to know is: What comes first? Desperation or The Regulators? ""Desperation"" is a good, old-style King story, and Bachman's Regulators is a bit disappointing. Not even the excess gore in some scenes saves it from its, let's face it, dumn plot. Let's just hope that the King isn`t really abdicating...."
2,"Dead, Flat",For an author like Richard B. (or SK) to write something like this is a huge disappointment. It wasn't worth the 2 digit price on it. Why is it so droll
3,An eerie mash of suburban nightmares,"Richard Bachman has created a novel that attempts to dissect the psyche of horror central to the science fiction and western. The characters, all cardboard cutouts, are placed in a situation not of their own doing, and all must find a way out, or die. Most die. The salvation of the survivors comes not from their own efforts, but from a delightful little rain man who speaks fluent telepath but the English of a newt with a respiratory disorder. Unfortunately for the suburban residents of this little Poplar street, the autistic child is also possessed by an ancient evil.This book will not scare you so much as make your buttocks clench at times. However, the image of the Moto-Kops teaming up with the boys from the Ponderosa will stay with me for a while, and I'll look a little more closely at the news van the next time it drives by"
5,FRESH NEW IDEA FOR A PLOT,"This is the first Stephen King book I ever read. And now that I have read it, I am a faithful follower of King and anticipate reading more of his novels, both those he has already written and any he may be yet to write. The storyline is excellent, not quite as believable (!) as Desperation, and with a really poor ending, but if you put aside these flaws and simply read, you will not be disappointed."
3,"Book OK; but excellent as a companion piece to ""Desperation""","My title says it all. The book was mildly scary, though perfect Bachman/King. However, it's true creepiness came from reading it immediately following it's doppelganger piece, DESPERATION, (by Stephen King), which I consider one of his true works of genius in dealing with good and evil. The parallels gave me the chills after reading the first chapter."
4,RECOMMENDED read,It's not SKs best but christ! it's a heck of alot better than most horror written by other authors.
5,Wonderful..Simply Wonderful,"Being a Stephen King fan for years, I only recently found this book and I was enthralled. Although the tale has several intermingling plots, it's a fast read. In fact I sat down and read it in less than a day. I highly reccomend this novel to Anyone!"
3,Audio-book was entertaining but gruesome,"I enjoyed listening to the audio version of this book -- never got bored -- but found it a bit gory and predictable.I'm not squeamish but found some of the bloodiness excessive, as if it were tacked on to distract from shallow character development and a limited plot. Definitely grim. And listening to careful descriptions of e.g. exploding eyeballs is worse than reading them.Characters tend toward black or white/good or evil. There are times when you can say to yourself, ""This one's going to get it."" And times when I'd have liked the story to speed up a little, which I could do if I were reading it.It was quite hard to remember who was who in the beginning -- many characters. (This improved as some got killed off...)Some great moments, though. And I grew to like the reading of Kate Nelligan, the narrator."
2,mostly boring and confusing!!!,"i've read a lot of stephen king's books and just loved some of them; unfortunately 'the regulators' was not one of these! it had a few good parts but was mostly just boring with about 50 characters too many! i guess if you are really bored and have absolutely nothing else to do, this book would be worth it. otherwise, opt for something else!"
2,What the heck?,"Desperation was one of King's best. Maybe not the best in terms of The Stand or IT, but it was a very good comback from novels like Insomnia and other worthless books. The Regulators is one of King's worst. This book was sooooo bad! I didn't even finish it and I hope most people don't even start it. Beware...of this....of this thing called a book!"
3,Terrific beginning - gets more and more boring,I have read better books by Stephen King. I think he should take a creative break for a while. Or there is the danger he will outlive his fame. What you really miss is ideas - new ideas. The plot of the novel does not develop. You know after 80 pages what the problem is. And then you are patiently waiting for the ending - the reader already knows who will die and who won't. And the same events happen over and over again.
2,"mean-spirited, violent & sometimes boring...","I was fully prepared for the violent, grotesque passages of Regulators. Any King movie adaptation would require an ""R"" rating - Regulators, if the movie version were faithful, would require an ""NC-17"" rating. That being said, the book gets bogged down with character-retreads from earlier King novels, and adding to the boredom is the overall repetition of the violence. Nothing new, but the book can be humorous and a few charcters are entertaining. Read this only if you plan to read the superior Desperation - It's fun to see the subtle changes in the ""parallel universes."""
1,"IS KING ""BACHMAN"" LOSING HIS TOUCH?","Another ""flop"". This one disappointed me as much as Desparation. The Bachman books were terrific (I've read them at least 20 times), I could hardly finish The Regulators. Looks like Richard and Steven need to get together and try to write one really good novel. I should have waited for the paperback edition instead of wasting $35."
5,Better than Desperation!,"This book is so incredible!!!!! I couldn't put it down! This could only come from the wonderfully sick mind of Stephen King. It is a sister book to Desperation, but written by his Richard Bachman pseudonym (the one King calls his ""evil twin"")! It's obvious in the differences between the two. I highly recommend reading both, but it can get confusing. Both books use the same character names with different personalities to bring the same basic plot of evil to different conclusions. I, personally, preferred The Regulators because it seemed more twisted and moved a bit faster. I might have felt the opposite if I'd read Desperation first though. Read them both and decide for yourself!!! Open your mind for this one, it is kind of comic-bookish, but it is so worth it! This is one of the best books I've EVER read!"
3,Not as good as Desperation,This is the 5th book that I have read by Stephen King and it is probably the worst. The plot never really developed and it wasn't scary at all. If you've read Desperation then skip this one and read something else.
2,Rena Regulator,"The book had many ups and downs--too many downs! It was hard to stay with, and was ultimately both boring and disappointing. Too many characters, and the only ones in the end that you cared about were supposedly killed off in a dumb way (were they really ""Killed"" or what???). And in the end, I didn't care."
2,Very ordinary,"I've just finished The Regulators and just starting Desperation. If it weren't for the great reviews of Desperation I would have got something else - but I thought the story was reasonable, just badly constructed.The idea that the whole thing (430 pages) takes place in a few houses in the one street in one afternoon/night reminds me of Geralds Game, and that was fairly poor also.The main story (people hiding from maniacs in vans) is very boring. However it is the 'underlying' story of a force that has become part of and taken over a young autistic child that kept me going - even this was boring at times.If you want horror read Salems Lot or The Shining, if you want a brilliant story read It or The Stand or The Green Mile.I just hope Desperation is better."
2,"Not even on a par with ""Christine"" or ""Needful Things"" .","I thought that the beginning was interesting enough, the so-called ""vintage"" King, but the book started dragging along soon after the first shot was fired.. the realism was there until the plot interceded.. almost didn't finish the book out of sheer boredom.. hopefully King will get out of the rut he seems to be in and return to his old ways.. two stars on name recognition alone."
2,Not King's Best,"If you like to read about meaningless characters who get killed off quickly and with plenty of gore, this book is for you. Otherwise there was little substance here and didn't strike me with fear; rather answers on how bad a book King could write.There were also a ton of characters to keep track of. Luckily, they die off pretty quickly and I didn't have to keep track of them for long ( you'd need a piece of paper to do it ).Read Desperation, that was a touch better ( but not much ), but this book has very little to offer."
3,it was worth it at the end,"I am a major King fan. I have read all of his novels. This novel was no where near his best, but it was good. There was so much violence right from the start that it was almost funny. The only death that I really felt for was Seth's. The rest of the book was just a blood bath that was hard to take seriously. The first half of the book is kind of boring. The plot just basically stands still for two hundred pages or so, but the closer you get towards the end the better it gets. I found myself to be very involved with the story in the end. I also felt terrible about Seth. There was a lot of other cool things that happened as well. It's not his best, but it's worth taking a look at. Over all I would say that it's a very enjoyable book that is a lot of fun."
2,Desperation Redux,To be able to write two books based on the same charaters is a luxury only the most popular authors can get away with. (OK Romance novelists make a career out of it)Too bad Desperation was the good book and The Regulators is an example of idea that should have stayeds in the notebook. I wish Steve would get tired of the evil unknowable force that does bad things because it feels like it. It reads more like Clive Barker than vintage King.
5,The Regulators,"This book was like a weird alternate reality that included the charecters from Desperation ,but they were totally different. It fell flat. If you see at a thrift store for next to nothing you should go ahead and buy it but I would'nt spend much money on it."
2,GLAK,"Richard Bachman's, ""The Regulators"", is an un-suspenseful story about an evil spirit on a street in Ohio. Although it was in our opinion poorly written( for we are 4 teenagers in an english class) it was greatly descriptive of the characters and setting. It confused us because it jumped around to view the many characters in the plot. It centered around blood and gore rather than supense and horror, and so then had major loopholes in the plot. 2 out of the 4 people in our group liked it."
2,Dreadful Schlock,"This novel gets 2 stars instead of 1 out of me only because I thought the beginning pages displayed a certain satisfying suspense, a feeling of impending dread, and I liked the way King captured the atmosphere of suburban American. It doesn't take long for the book to deteriorate though, and it gets bad. I mean, really, REALLY bad. I just came back to reading King after being away from him for a long time, and if ""The Regulators"" is any indication of the stuff he's churning out now, I think I'll go back to staying away.You might be interested in checking out the sister book to this, ""Desperation."" It's better by far, but it's still a much flabbier, more undisciplined book than I remember King producing in the past."
2,Not one of King's best,"The Regulators, was a book that will eventually get you hooked but it takes way too long, if you want a good book from King read anything but this.....the usage of characters from Desperation although in slightly different roles was ok but the book just doesn't meet the norm for King."
3,Again.,"Great and quite exciting storytelling but...it just seems like we have heard this story before. And then again, once more..."
1,Dreadful,"I've been a fan of Stephen King since the 70's and like most of his books. I've enjoyed very much less popular novels like Roadwork, Gerald's Game, Rose Madder, under the Dome. He is excellent, but this...For me patently aweful in every way. One dimensional characters that do nothing, inspire to nothing. A kiddies' tale of ""Toy Story"" meets Damien Omen; miserable forced inflictions of Bonanza (which you either love or hate, and I hate) with extreme pointless violence thrown in, and some cringing descriptions and scenes."
3,Regulators/Desperation kind of the same book.,"It was awhile back that I read Deperation. Not a bad book. When I picked up Regulators, I kept thinking that I had picked up a book I already read (That does happen sometimes, but not with Stephen King, I remember every book I read by him). The town setting was great and the characters wonderful as usual. I still liked the book, but I couldn't understand why the two were almost the same, not a sequel or prequel. I assume this was an alternate version of the same story. You will want it in your collection if you're a SK fan, but if your looking for something new and you have already read Desperation, choose something else."
3,Was ok but lacked A LOT!,I read it and enjoyed it but it really lacked some horror and action the way that king can serve up!
1,King.....not at his best,"This novel seemed to go on without much of a plot, and I would have to say it is one of his worst. Desperation is much much better, The regulators is just well hardly worth the effort."
2,A non-frightening novel that does not connect,"It is almost a travesty to consider this undefined novel in the same league as King's other novel, Desperation. Also, the letters that King threw in at the end of each chapter could have been written in an off-the-cuff manner throughout the story. King's repetative use of character names appears to have been an effort to sucker readers in that have already finished reading Desperation. The bottom line is that the novel doesn't work at any level."
1,Stephen King's poorest novel.,"Every author has a bad day. Desperation was a quality book, unfortunately The Regulators is at the opposite spectrum. By far the worst book ever written by King."
2,Where did this story come from?,"The Regulators was okay. I think that even King's worst is better than many author's best works. There is depth to the novel, and the beginning is grabbing, but after all the cartoon/action figures come in, I am turned off. Around the end I had to skip around just to make it to the last chapter. I was very disappointing. Desperation, on the other hand, was one of the best Stephen King books ever! It had everything and the end made me want to sing!!!"
5,Amazing book,"It was hard to put it down once I started reading it, very good book I got Desperation which is a companion book to this one."
4,another great king story,Tak will keep me awake yet againanother great story by the master of horror.I would welcome another story of Tak
3,Been better by King,"Fairly intresting plot...as usual.. Didn't care for bringing ""Tak"" back but will probably be used again. The carnage and horror just went on forever ad there were so many characters I couldn't really place all of tem until about 1/3 of the way through."
3,Another good King read.,"Catching up on all the master's stories. Gory as expected, imaginative. Worth the time yet many other stories more thrilling."
5,A Superb book; Much better than Desperation,"Have you ever imagined your quiet suburban neighborhood turning into the most violent place on earth? This is exactly what happens in this book because of an evil parasite known as ""Tak"" that takes over the body of an autistic little boy.As residents of the block fight the evil and try to survive, they are confronted with their own demons. Racism, lust, cowardness are just some of the issues that come to surface. The characters are excellent."
4,A good book - I read this one first.,"I really liked this book. It is a little more gorey than my taste but it was very original and i loved all the letters, scripts, pictures and other notes added in. It's true the charaters were not as defined as the story but i really liked how the town was changing around them. I'd have to say the part when they try to get out off the block is my favorite. I think my opinion might have been a little different if i would have read Desperation first. That book had a better plot. I enjoyed how the books were intertwined, it made it very enjoyable and a fast read."
2,Violently unentertaining and unbelievable,"Don't let ""The Regulators"" keep you from reading ""Desperation.&quot"
2,Not one of King's best,"We have all been there before. The characters are not defined enough which causes some confusion as to who's who. It is definitely not scary, but I don't mind as long as it is fun. This book is not fun. I hope Desperation is better. I was disappointed since I enjoyed THE GREEN MILE immensely"
3,"Not too great, but okay","If your are only going to buy one of King's new novels, better make it ""Desperation"".This book isn't very good, although it is certainly readable. It's not scary, or funny, or ineligent for that matterThis book is not good, and has the lukewarm quality of ""Christine"". King is not even consistent regarding the characters behind the two books.Bottom Line: ""Desperation"" is King at his best, but this book makes him look, not like the ""King"" of horror, but more like the city councilman of it.It's like some college student read one of the initial five Bachman books and tried to plagurise it."
3,too many undeveloped characters.,"There were entirely too many undeveloped characters to keep up with. I couldn't remember who was whom because sometimes he would call them by their first name, last name, or nickname. There were too many characters and they were all one dimensional. I didn't care if they lived or died. I wanted them to die actually because I was bored. I was only interested when they died. I only recommend reading this if you're a King fan and even then you'll probably have to plod through like I did. This was worse than Under The Dome which I didn't think was one of his best works either."
2,Had high hopes that this would be better than its sister novel desperation,"I had high hopes that this would be better than its sister novel Desperation...but it fell flat, just like its sister. It started out all right but then it just petered out slowly from there. King had a great premise here and he didn't come through on it. Disappointed.I usually rate books on their re-readability. Desperation and Regulators are not worthy of re-reading."
4,"A well written, suspenseful book, although not for everyone","The Regulators seems like a normal level Stephen King book (although written under his other name, Richard Bachman). It is well written, very suspenseful, and very surprising. The only problem that I see is that the book is not for everyone. It is violent and contains large amounts of vulgar language. There are a lot of adult items, so it shouldn't be read by the numerous child fans of King. But other than that there are no real flaws, and is a thrill to read"
3,The Power Rangers in modern day Mayberry,"I was very excited to find that the widow Bachman found this script. This is one of the better books that King or Bachman have had out lately. I have heard that ""Desperation"" is a little better but this is enjoyable. The storyline is easy to follow.The only problem I had was with the Power Ranger-like villains. This was very unbelievable, even for King. The conflict between the characters was very interesting. Bachman makes many of the characters self serving. They don't care about anyone except for themselves and their close family. That is how many of the people nowadays would act.I think it is definitely worth reading, although, I am looking forward to ""Desperation"" which has the same characters as ""The Regulators""."
1,Horrible.,"I absolutely despised this book. I remember seeing this and King's Desperation together in the book store, and that they were being marketed in tandem, able to be read in either order. For those of you who don't know, The Regulators uses the same characters from Desperation (although they all have vastly different personalities and relationships with one another). Well, I read Desperation first...thank goodness. THAT was a fantastic book. Then I tried to read this one. It was like King didn't even try to write a decent book here. I can barely even begin to describe how much I hated this book. Imagine taking a story that you love and mixing up who all of the characters are, then killing them all off for no other reason than just to do it. That's all this book is. It has no redeeming qualities whatsoever. No plot, no mystery, nothing compelling at all. It really does read like a child wrote it, or at best, a complete novice. Please...avoid this horrid travesty."
2,"Richard Bachman, Not Stephen King","When you see the name Richard Bachman on the cover, you can be sure you're not getting Stephen King. The Regulators falls into that side of Stephen King that involves mass destruction by some sort of unknown force. People die. There is blood. Chaos ensues. And most importantly, the book didn't make me peek behind closed doors before I went to bed. Here's to hope that Desperation fills in the gaps of horror left out in this part of the collection."
1,Absolute garbage,"If you like a book with no surprises, about 27 characters to keep track of, and lots of repetitive mass-murder scenes, then this book is for you. Otherwise, choose something else. Terrible job by the author on this one. There's so little content here that he could have written this story in ten pages.Note that Desperation, by contrast, is actually a very good story. Do not confuse the two."
1,Could not read,"I nearly always love his books.Not this one.I was incapable of reading it.It was that bad.Just awful.Maybe it was the use of altered characters from the (great)book ""Desperation"".Anyway,bad."
4,Kept me reading.,"I for one,enjoyed this book. I usually have a hard time staying interested with book's this size, but I found I couldn't wait to get back to this story."
1,I wish I could have read it while sleeping...,"to save time. Well, it almost had the same effect. Forced myself to get through it. I have Desperation, but don't know if I want to read it now.Every time I thought the story was going to get exciting and interesting, it would never quite peak. Quite a tease that way. It read like a Bachman/King concept that never fully developed by the time the book was written. The hand-written diary entries grew VERY tiring."
4,A nasty and brutal gripper!,"I loved this novel. Despite what people may say, i think this is a better book then desperation. At first i wasn't sure if i was going to like it or not.....Then the van pulls up......They have shotguns.......Then people start dieing. The town never knew what hit them and nothing they could have done would have ever prepared them for Tak and THE REGULATORS. Awesome book, awesome imagination."
3,So-So,"Not one of The King's best efforts, although there is plenty of comic book violence and chaos. Get a fresher novel like ""Night of the Beast"" by Harry Shannon, or the upcoming ""The Rising"" by Brian Keene if you want a terrific pulp story.This one feels a bit like an expanded piece of short fiction."
1,One star is too much,"Let me begin by saying I love Stephen King. I have read just about everything he has written and immensely enjoy his creative plot twists and interesting characters. However, after doggedly struggling through the first third of the Regulators, I was bored. Keeping track of the flat and uninteresting characters made this book nearly impossible to read. I was able to accurately predict the ending. Even the first fifty pages of the Talisman weren't this bad. This book is a step backward for King."
3,"Very, very interesting","I'm reading Desperation and Regulators at the same time. I havent' finished them yet (about 1/2 way thru on each), but I must commend King on his idea. There are fascinating parrallels and contrasts in the characters and plot. Collie is a psycho-villian in Desperation but a sort of Allen Pangborn in Regulators. The Carvers have a switcheroo. The people come to the evil in Desperation but the evil comes to them in Regulators. Personally, I feel that the Regulators is much better than Desperation. There isn't as much depth, but the characters are better drawn (on a side note, it seems that Bachman focuses on the characters that King did not, providing a more ""2 halves of the whole"" feel to these two books). Desperation's main shortcoming is the highly annoying David Carver, and the excess of attention given to him. I will probably write another review after I finish the books. Until then, I'm giving them three stars (a.k.a. a ""neutral"" rating)"
2,jolly rotten,"This is disjointed hodgepodge of ridiculous events, pipping 'Insomnia' for the mantle of King's worst work. Supposedly a companion volume for the much better (but still not great) 'Desperation', it reads more like an entry to the write a novel in an afternoon competition. Save your seven bucks."
2,King Must Laugh All The Way To The Bank,"Having just finished reading The Regulators I must saythat I find all of the enthusiastic praise for this bookperplexing. The premise is ridiculous, even for King. Mixin gore, sex and profanity for mass appeal and you havethe literary equivelant of toilet paper. Useful at the momentand then quite disposable. I also found the use ofdifferent typeface as well as pseudo handwritten portionsnothing more than gimmickry. If anyone would like toexperience a real chill then read Dracula, which is 100years old. Does anyone really believe The Regulatorswill have any literary value (other than to King) in 100years? It doesn't now"
2,Not bad but not good either,"I found it to be suspenseful and frightening enough in places but I had a lot of complaints, including the repetitive nature of the massacre scenes (oh, the vans are back AGAIN), the fact that the scenes from the Garron house were completely stomach-wrenching and painful to read (like the rape scene), and the unsatisfying ending. This is pure pulp fiction, fun in places (in its 'end of the world' chaos in suburbia) but flawed."
2,Far from Steven King's best,"Perhaps I'm becoming a little jaded, having read most of Kings works, but this is far from his best. The Regulators is basically alot of ""same old..been there, done that"" the telepathically manipulative Evil presence (Tak) that wreaks havoc in ways that are way out, too incredible to be believed. It's never made clear what Taks motives are , if it is an alien, or what. The characters or more aptly ""caricatures"" are wooden and engender no sympathy, the way you cared for the children in ""IT"", or the little Torrence boy in ""The SHINING"". The only thing the book inspired in me was a desire to go out & rent a video of the 50's movie western that gives the book its title. I think this is a case of mailing it in; he's done it all before and done it better. I will admit, that it's still a page turner once the action starts."
1,HATED IT (Desperation is much better!!!),"Hopefully this will be the only time Stephen King tries the gimmick of companion novels. Found this one to be boring and predictable and the juxtaposition of characters from ""Desperation"" confusing.I literally ran out and bought this book after finishing ""Desperation"" but was highly disapointed. Glad I only lost the money on a paper back.Final Note: ""Desperation"" (the compainion novel) is CLASSIC, FANTASTIC King!!!!"
3,"Better than Desperation, not as good as 'Salem's Lot. :-)","From these reviews, I must be the only one who thought The Regulators was a better book than its companion novel. It didn't pull me in and rearrange me the way some of his books have (that happens less often with King writings now), but it was fun in a wildly irreverent way."
4,I liked it.,"This book is nowhere near as good as Desperation, or many other King novels. But i'm sorry, there is no denying that this book isn't interesting, intriguing, comical and suspenseful. And there is a scene in the book that had me more terrified than anything I have read since ""it"" and for that scene this book is worth it...make sure you read Desperation first!!!!!!"
2,I like the real Stephen King better!,"Desperation was great, and I started the Regulators almost a year ago, and then had to stop for a while, and now that I tried getting into it again (I remembered the characters, etc. easily enough) it doesn't have me involved anymore. Maybe I should start over, but that doesn't appeal to me. I'm going to try finishing it sometime, but right now, I'm going to read Rose Madder instead."
4,"Weird, but enjoyable","This is a rather scary book, but not quite the style of the usual King book. When I first started reading it, I wasn't sure what might happen. There's a lot of crazy plot twists and surprises to keep you interested, and I had a hard time putting down this book, what with the kids' TV shows coming to reality and that evil spirit who tortures the poor boy and his aunt and the freakout that ensues as the neighbors have to deal with what the heck is happening all around them. There's some fantastic scenes within this book. I definitely enjoyed it, and any SK fan should. A solid 4/5 stars."
3,A good novel,"This was a good, but not great novel. I read Desperation first and thought this novel would be as good or a continuation. Instead he changed the roles of certain characters without ever explaining the connection (besides the same villain). I was a little confused and kept expecting a connection between the characters to appear, but it never did. Some sections of the novel are still classic King and kept me in suspense. However, the novel seemed to lack continuity or as much suspense as I have become accustomed to. I am a little frustrated that the hero in many of the last few novels of King's that I have read are children. He ascribes traits and thought processes that I do not think ten to twelve year olds are capable of. Maybe if I read this novel before Desperation I would have liked it better. I think this story was too unbelievable, and I would recommend skipping this novel and trying a different one."
1,Total time-waster,"Stephen King has written some killer novels (""The Shining"" is a masterpiece) but this is one long horrible piece of... well, he'll be more than happy to share this vulgarity and many others once you crack the cover. I have seldom felt a writer forcing a non-idea to onto the page as much as in this book. It reads like the worst piece of ""fan"" writing one has ever seen on the net. You can tell from reading the ""positive"" reviews here that something's not right -- they're trying to ""get"" it. King should take some time off and stoke his jets.."
4,Great Read,I loved this book. It was a great read. I got into it right away. I want to marry Derrick. Get it and learn from it.
5,Genius,"This is, simply put-one of the most incredible albums ever made. I first heard papa m when opening for stereolab. From the first notes of their set I stood transfixed, stunned, amazed, at the beatuy and simpicity of their music. David Pajo (who wrote and performed all the parts on this Cd) is truely a genius, one of the most original and intelligent guitar players in any style of music. Also check out the s/t Ariel M album, sort of a little brother to this album....Btw-this IS NOT a live album."
3,We're Gonna Need a Bigger Book...,"Wilkin captures childhood and its environs perfectly in her illustrations. Prose (written by others) is simple and great for early readers. Great price here at Amazon. The only reason I give this book three stars is because I believe that Wilkin's classics should have been included in this book- ""The New Baby"", ""We Help Daddy"", and ""We Like Kindergarden"" (""We Help Mommy"" is included in the book). The stories included are obscure and do not have that ""wow!"" factor that the aforementioned, missing stories do. To forewarn atheists or adults not ready to explain the whole higher-being deal or adults who do not desire to profess belief in a male god- there is a story included titled ""My Little Golden Book About God"". Sorry to say so-so selection-wise."
4,Super music that really captures the soul and heart!!!!!!!,I was able to see him in concert in Oakland. Henri is fantastic plus his music will definitely capture you. This is a must by CD.
4,Relevant Information,This book is a good read for any woman who wants to get in shape and stay in shape. If you want to look good from head to toe. Very simple techniques and suggestions to achieve optimum health and beauty. This is def a keeper. I will always use this as a reference tool.
2,Old Book,"This book had a lot of good ideas, but old ones'. I didn't realize before i bought it, it would be so old."
2,Not very helpful,"This is an OK book. Too wordy and hard to figure out exactly what it is trying to teach you. A good overview if you are totally clueless, but not a specific plan for training."
3,A good first effort.,"While I found the plot a little weak, I very much enjoyed the character of Romilia, a rookie detective and Latina living with her son and mother. She's smart, interesting and fully dimensional. The writing is solid and I enjoyed the aspects of Latin culture incorporated into the characters and the story. All in all, it's a good first effort."
4,looks great,looks great but was smaller than expecting. Make dishes look nice and modern makes a great center peice and very easy to clean.
1,Looked nice...,"... never got to try it. It arrived in a zillion sharp pieces. The ""protective packaging"" was pretty much non-existent, a bit of wadded up paper on one side of it. I've never had a problem with Amazon's packaging before so putting it down as a fluke. On the plus side, returning the item and getting a refund was a breeze."
4,convenient,"I use it for my daughter's lunchbox. I put them in the freezer when I want her food to be cold, and in the microwave for 2 minutes when I want her food warm."
3,"Not what expected, but works","They look much nicer in the picture. They are actually gel in a plastic bag, they could improve the appearance. But they work very well."
2,Teeny tiny itty bitty,"No where does the description give a SIZE for these things. I assumed wrong. I got 2 Blue (no red) that are called hot/cold combo which is fine, but the plastic is very thin (think cheap ziplock bag) and do not look very durable at all. Each pack is about 5"" x 6"" so much smaller than I thought based on photos."
3,Not what I expected,"This item works ok but not what I expected. I wanted a large size hot/cold pack to fit under my large casserole dish. Instead, I got a small size and have to use two--it does work though. I thought the cost was a little high for what I got. Live and learn."
1,Don't go by pictures,The product I received would no way keep my casserole hot or cold. They were only about 4 x 6 in. in size. Very disappointed in them especially for the price. Buyer beware!
1,Not what I ordered and not as pictured,"What I thought I ordered were inserts for the pyrex to go carriers. I needed a new hot and cold pack set and based on the photos, that's what I thoguht I ordered. What I received were tiny ice/heat medical packs which are not what I wanted. No point in trying to do a return. Very unsatisfied that they couldn't fulfill the order properly."
1,Not what you expect,"I thought that these packets were going to be larger and more sturdy - they are like the ones you would get at the pharmacy to use for sore joints or swollen hands, not for keeping your food warm or cold. I was very disappointed."
1,Gel leaked,I purchased these to replace the hot pack from my pyrex portable. You get two packs in a set that can either be frozen or heated. I heated both to replace one pyrex portable hot pack.I returned these to Amazon because they leaked. When I heated them in the microwave (following the instructions) they expanded and the plastic seam separated allowing the gel to leak out the side.
3,Gel pack size is what I was looking for,"Perfect size for me, but gel freezes up, which it should have. But for the price, I'm fine with it."
3,Too small,I bought the packs to replace a pyrex portable pack. It was quite a bit too small but they may work. I was hoping for more.
2,prince lionheart hot and cold pak,The first time I attempted to warm the Pak it burst! I set it for 3 minutes as there are no directions included with the item. Very disappointed!
3,Typical rearview glassses,These are just like the ones I remember when I was a kid. Couldn't go wrong with the price either.
5,Great stocking stuffer,"Great, cheap, wonderful stocking stuffer that all of the kids loved. Just wish I had gotten them from the grownups, too."
5,Very nice,"The perfect book for the avid reader, these are well written and enjoyable. These tales bring a flavor of life to the reader that is rare in writing today."
1,120 pages of whining from someone who's not even from Wyoming.,"I live in Wyoming and I had to read this book for my American Government class. Not only is it extremely boring, but all the guy does is trash Wyoming and its people. His entire book relies on the point that the Wyoming people maintin a ""cowboy"" state of mind and think that big business and money are evil. Though many wear cowboy boots around here, nobody thinks they are still a genuine ""cowboy"". He also, for some reason, suggests that the solution to our problems is to build another University (appearently so that we'll have twice as many graduates leaving the state). Good job on that one Sam Western. Next time take the time to learn [...]a state.In conclusion, go ahead and read this book if you want to know some out-of-state whiner's opinion on something he has no idea about."
5,A College Educational Tool,"My class At Sheridan Comm. College was assigned his book to read. It is a different look into the growth of Wyoming. He gives several examples of the crises and images that Wyoming has substained over the years. I would say that if you enjoy finding out how states have come to be or how they overcame situtions of ecomonic growth and false images this would be a good reading material. There are a few typing errors and he tends to use big words. I would advise having a dictionary near by, but overall the material flows from one chapter to the next very easily. Thanks for the extra reading material. Enjoy!"
1,Always preview songs before you purchase!,Awful album - was so dissappointed - just a weird collection of strange music that makes no sense.
1,Poor design,"The lock and trim piece fit on fine. However, the top of the trim piece restricts the tailgate handle from opening. I had to remove the trim piece and contact manufacture for a solution. No answer yet."
2,"Nice picture, too bad these sets are all defective.","Pros: Amazing clarity of details.Cons: Crooked screen.Notice the downward sloping of the screen to the right, a full 1/4"" in widescreen DVD mode. Drives ya crazy doesnt it?I returned two of these sets to Best Buy for the same reason, Customer Service agreed that we would keep pulling them off the shelf till we found one that was in proper alignment (I brought a tape measure). We never found one, and 3 opened boxes later I opted for my money back.This is an epidemic problem with Toshiba because if you study many of their flat screens CRTs on display, you will see this problem over and over, for different size TVs. The technical problem is a misalignment or misregistration of the mask on the tube. What a shame, you used to have to pay extra for the Toshiba name and the quality product they manufactured. Replaced this dog with a Flatscreen 14"" Advent/DVD and have been very happy with it right out of the box."
4,Alright for a college dorm,"I am college student on a relatively low budget and very little space to house a gigantic TV. This is the perfect television for any college dorm or youngsters room. The tv's DVD drive is exceptional, and the flat screen panel offers a great crisp picture."
2,Common Toshiba deffect,I've read a few reviews of Toshiba tv's and it seems that mine has a common problem. One day it just decided to turn itself off!! If I press the ON button it will click on and then automatically click itself off a half second later. Basically it's broken and unwatchable as there is no way to get it to stay ON. I had it just over a year before this happened but it sounds lieke I'm not the only one to experience this in this model. Buy something else if you want it to last.
1,POWER ISSUE,"Well, I just read the current reviews, and I had the same power issues that everyone had. The TV just stopped working. Fortunately, I purchased the TV from Costco and I was able to return my TV when the TV would not turn it on.Before the power issue, we loved the TV. The picture was great, options were great, sound was good, and we loved the styling. Unfortunately an important element is that is turns on when we like to watch it, this TV lacked this option.By the way for those cannot return the TV, my husband and I noticed that if leave the TV unplugged for a day or three. It will work again for a couple more weeks and than stop working again."
5,Not all are defective - ours has been awesome 5 years now,"Just was looking for some specs on our unit and had to defend it after seeing all these reviews. It has been especially dependable, not a problem. Great little set."
1,Defective,"This was purchased as an extra tv for our home and has only been used a few times since we purchased it a couple of months ago. It is already broken. When you push the power button on, it will not power up. Of course, the retailer (Voltelectronics will not give us credit or return it. I was told to go through Toshiba. We'll see what happens. What a hassle!!!!"
3,Man in the Attic (VHS),"An older woman hiding her younge lover in the attic of her house for years without her husband suspecting any unusual activity seems unreal, expect that this movie is based on a true story. Anne Archer is leading the action, Neil Patrick Harris is doing what he can but has some good moment considering that he was 22 when he played that complicated caracter.The uncommun situation of the story keeps you going, wanting to know how it's going to end...but the end was really flat..Was nominated for 3 Gemini awards."
4,Pretty funny.,"No AS funny as I'd hoped, but DL Hughley was hilarious as always, Arnez J started off slow in my opinion, but was very funny. And Earthquake was funny as always. The Phoenix, Arizona All Star Comedy Jam with Cedric, Tommy Davidson, Aries Spears, DeRay and Kevin Hart was much funnier in my opinion."
4,It was good but..,Overall it is great it just has some parts that are a little slow. But you won't feel like you wasted your money. In fact I am getting ready to watch it now.
2,Not Top Notch,Arnez J wasn't as good as I expected. The others were okay. The one that Cedric the Entertainer hosted was 10 times better.
4,"Practical, step by step approach to JAD.","Excellent treatment of what has become a widely mis-used Information Systems development technique. You could spend hours muddling through the volumes written on JAD and never really understand HOW to actually conduct a JAD. This book is a step by step, guide book for the real JAD practitioner. Contains example room layouts, sample forms for the scribe, and outlines for the documentation products produced throughout the JAD phases."
4,the classic JAD text book,"Comprehensive, effectively illustrating do's and don'ts based on years of experience. Essential for all consulting firms and in-house IT departments. Based on my experience, JAD techniques have been essential for capturing all system requirements and developing applications in an efficient manner."
4,super value,"Great set! My daughter loves these stories (and I do too!), so we probably should have gotten these in hardcover since they will get a lot of wear & tear."
5,WaysideSchool,I like the book because of the 30th chapter called Louis.Louis had a big surprise at the end of the 30th chapter. I thought it was funny.by Mitsuko
2,Missing pages and duplicated pages in one of the books,The Sideways Stories from Wayside School book has a large section missing and other sections duplicated.UPDATE: Returned set for exchange. The replacement set was printed correctly. Thanks Amazon!
5,Take it from a teacher,I teach second grade and I read this book every year. I read the first chapter on the first day of school. It is very exciting and shocking at the same time. It sets the tone that my class is not dull at all. This is a great read aloud for second graders. It's also perfect for reluctant readers in third or fourth grade.
5,I can't get my kid to stop reading these!!!,My second-grade son can't get enough of these hilarious and wacky stories. We've read them all and can't wait for the next one. What a great feeling to have him begging to read before bed every night!
5,Great reading for all!,"This is a series of books which I was read in elementary school. I'd looked all over to find it to add to my collection and when I did, my childhood came back again. Needless to say, my children LOVED the stories of Wayside School!"
5,Replacement books,"I purchased this set of books after my puppy chewed up the teacher's set.My grandson is not an avid reader. This set of books was something he enjoyed reading. Such silly nonsensical stories. Very entertaining to stop and ask ""what does that mean?"" or ""how can this be?""These books are best if shared together."
5,wayside school,"I purchased these books for my son, we received them less than a week,fast service,it's a very good books for young kids to read."
1,First Book is All Messed Up,"The first book in the box, Sideways Stories from Wayside School is printed in correctly. The pages go from the beginning on p. 9 to p. 32. Instead of page 33, the book has p. 65 (through 96). Once you hit p. 96, the book then goes back to p. 65 and has all the pages up to the end of the book.So, pages 33 - 64 are completely missing.The other two books in the boxed set appear to be fine."
1,sideways stories from wayside school,I would advise you not to read this book because it would have you wondering what happened to the other characters.P.S. If iwere you i would not read this book pleas take my advise
4,Great Book,This book is about a class. They are located on the 30th story of their school. You'll meet john who can only read upside down. Sammy the stinky one. Laugh your guts off as you read these wacky stories.This book is appropriate for middle grade readers and for people who love comedy books This book is by the Newberry award winner Louis Sachar {rhymes with cracker} who also wrote Wayside School is falling down and Wayside school gets a little stranger.-Smiles
5,If you want funny books look at this!!!,"These books are both funny and exiting. The kids in this book are odd but nice and speical in there own way. Talk about funny in one of these books someone brings in a hobo for show and tell.Just to let you know this school has 30 stories a classroom on each floor. There is no nineteenth storie, Miss Zarves teachs class on the nineteenth storie. There is no Miss Zarves."
4,Stories from Wayside School,"This is verey funny book writen by my favorite author Louis Schacher. There is a sequel to this book, it is ""Wayside School Gets A Little Stanger"" where even stanger and funnyer things happen."
1,most of the pages are missing,"I love how it goes from page 32 to 64 with everything missing in between. Do yourself a favor and look through every book IMMEDIATELY to avoid the mistake of purchasing half-printed books! Amazon, Thanks again for sending me a book that is missing pages and ruining my attempt to get back some of my childhood. I'm sure the author is proud :-\"
2,Oops. This book is for six year olds.,"It was not clear, to me at least, that this book is not Moby Dick, but a watered down version for those who are learning to read. I thought it'd be nice for my 10 year old nephew to have something to read with a few illustrations. Unless your child is learning to read, six years old or younger, this book is not for them. Buyer beware..."
5,makes life so much easier,"LOVE this product! I cant count the number of times my daughter drops her paci at the park, or in walmart, or under a restraunt table. We just added a couple drops of mouthwash to the water like the directions recommend and dont have to feel bad about giving it back to her after she drops it. One of the coolest gadgets in my diaper bag, and i have a LOT of things in there to make my life easier!"
1,"Great idea, but doesn't really work!","I purchased this thinking it would be so handy since the baby will constantly drop the pacifier. The water container is way too small and the spray does not spray enough.....it only wets the tip of the pacifier, not nearly enough for me to feel it's clean enough to put it in his mouth again. I'm gonna get the wipes for emergency cases, rather than use this product."
2,"Good idea, but leaks!","I don't know if the one I received is missing a piece or is just defective, but the sprayer is really loose and leaks in my diaper bag."
2,Did not work for me,"Two stars cause of the idea wich I think is good, but mine came broken where the spray goes mine is plastic and broken (wich in this pic shows metal) so the cap does not stay put causing it to leak, so is going back"
4,Dog Loves IT,"This is our dogs favorite toy. He will not play with any other frisbee. The center opening makes it easy for him to catch and retrieve and he can actually carry 3 in his mouth at once. He is really funny when playing with these. Pricey though especially when he chews it, it doesn't hold up well to his chewing, however, it still flies so you don't need to trash it when it starts looking bad. The dog doesn't care."
4,The basics for a low fat diet.,"This book changed my life too. It is an outstanding (if a little out of date - 1985) look at our high fat diets and how they contribute to atherosclerosis of our blood vessels. A must read for those folks looking for low, low, cholesterol levels ( <160 mg/dl)."
1,Not truly Blu-Ray and does not work on most players... Don't buy!!!!,This DVD does not work in either of my Blu-Ray players. Sony states that they upgraded my Firmware so it's the fault of the DVD manufacturer. I called and left a message and have been ignored when I ask for help. As far as I am concerned the company is bogus and unrealiable and Amazon should not carry such poor quality illigitamate products as this. Buyer beware this product does not work on most Blu-Ray players and if I did get a bogus DVD there is no customer support to try and fix the issue. Since the item is opened I basically lost my money so I will not recomend nor endorse any of this companies poor excuse for a product!!!!! My Blu-Ray Players are both not listed in the warning so don't trust the warning just skip it!!!! Every other Blu-Ray disk I have purchased from a repudible manufacturer has worked wonderfully so the fault lies with the Living Landscapes product!!!
4,Amazing Watch,"I bought this watch a week ago and shipped it with Amazon free shipping and it arrive a few days early, which is amazing and I don't need to pay extra for shipping. The watch is amazing and have a look to it, but is a lot glossier than the picture show (which I don't mind). It haven't loss any time yet, but I only have it for a few days. This will be my first watch and it honestly doesn't feel ""clunky"" as other portray, but a pretty easy fit and fit properly on your wrist. I do wear it loosely, which does get annoying at time, but isn't a big fuss. The only reason why I give it a 4 of 5 is because it came with some part of the leather being engraved in by some sort of point, although it's noticeable, it's not noticeable unless you're at least a feet in distance with it."
3,"Bulky, calendar is not working properly.","(-)1. Incredibly large, looks massive.2. The belt gives a certain fell of shoe sole.3. The box and the packaging are appalling.(+)1. Good, awesome stainless steel.2. Nice, easily distinguished digits.3. Cute night glow.Besides, calendar is not working, however, what do You expect for such a price?Y."
3,"great product, poor packaging","Love the bowl and would recommend it to others. However, 2 of the 3 that I ordered were broken. Amazon of course replaced them quickly but I wouldn't order it if you need it quickly. Expect to have a delay because of replacement."
5,Perfect!,Just what I wanted...arrived quickly and in excellent shape..no breakage..well packed...should work well for all kinds of dips and sauces.
1,no chance to use,Unfortunately I had no chance to us this product. When they arrived they were broken into many pieces.
1,noise,"Lithops is the alter ego of Mouse on Mars led by Jan St. Werner with production help from Andi Toma....and that is precisely where the similarities end. Where MoM has IDM sensibilities perfectly balancing groove with texture, this one is just found noise fused with even more assembled entropy....alternate suggested listening -Odori,Music Is Rotted One Note,Jazz From Hell. Relegate this to the recycle bin!"
4,If you are an Amanda Marshall Fan....,"You will enjoy this CD...true Amanda Marshall...true fans have heard all the songs - however, its nice to have them in one place"
1,Something fishy here.,The picture here for the Law & Order: The Ninth Year shows actors Jeremy Sisto and Anthony Anderson. The 9th season aired almost 10 years prior to either of these actors first appearance on Law & Order. What's going on here? Is this some kind of a grift?
3,No episode list!,"I just recieved the ninth year DVD, opened it to peruse the episode list to pick out my favorite and lo and behold, there isn't one! What? At first, I thought maybe it was a mistake until I read another review saying the same thing! Am I supposed to just know the order? How chinzy is this? I love L & O, but this really is bad. That's why the low star rating. The picture on the front is correct, however. C'mon, Universal, you can do better than this!!!! Probably no extras, either, but I don't know because there isn't any listing!"
3,"Great show, cheapo packaging","I'm a huge L&O; fan and am glad to get Season 9. Thank you to one of the other reviewers who pointed me to where Slideshow part 2 was hiding--as a special feature on disc 1? when Slideshow part 1 is on disc 3? That doesn't make any sense. With no list of episodes it's a waste of time to try and track this down, I thought it would be one of the regular episodes on the discs esp since the back cover specifically mentions it. But, at least they included the part 2, which is great.I don't mind the slim packaging, but the manufacturers should include a list of episodes."
2,Missing episode,"Where is Sideshow part 2 . The box says it is included, but we can't find it on any of th disks. Is this a rip off ? Can we get out money back?"
1,Another completely bad Disc 2! Buyer Beware,"Disc 2 is completely unwatchable, as the previous poster said, instead of watching the episodes on Disc 2, you get to watch endlessly, the Universal logo. I got Season 9 as a Christmas present, I'm telling the person who bought it for me to send it back and get a refund or credit! Something to think about, you have 30 days to find all the problems, or you are STUCK with them. Usually, there is just one episode that has a problem. Here, the viewer cannot access the material on disc 2.I have had a very good experience with Amazon over the years, but a much less pleasant one with Universal. Their DVDs of the various Law and Order series, have far too many problems, sometimes it seems like the Law & Order discs are made to 3rd world standards, apparently no check is made to see if the disc even works or not."
4,Worst packaging Ever,"First of all, I love Law and Order, but I feel the packaging of season 9 was done so cheaply.If anyone has Netflixs on their computers or televison season 1-8 are availlable to stream right onto your computer or TV for viewing. Netflixs is $8.00 a month and they have seaons 1-12 of Law and Order SVU available for streaming too. I just thought I would share the information with you, and I hope they start releasing more seasons of Law and Oder since the boxset is out."
4,Adding to my L&O's,"I got the dvd and love it. In fact I am doing a marathon as we speak. I get tired of football, especially when the 9ers are losing, (of course that won't last). How about those Giants!!Got it and all is good!"
1,Law and Order Season 9 Disc 2,I am complaining that something is wrong with the 2nd Disc of Season 9 will not work it comes up showing the Universal Emblem then goes to it over and over again. the 2nd DVD Does play at all I tried it on different DVD Players in my house. I even cleaned the DVD Players but each time the DVD SEASON 9 DISC 2 of Law and Order would not play. this is a ripoff I want a new dvd of law and order season 9 sent to me asap this is crap buying something on line and this is what happens. send me a new DVD That works. disc 2 will not work.Lon Hebert
3,rating of packaging only,They skimped on the packaging but the price remains the same as previous years. How Scrooge-like can you get? I bought it but but I'm not happy.
5,"""Law and Order"" also features a bonus crossover episodes between ""Law and Order"" and ""Homicide Life On The Street.""","The ninth season of ""Law and Order"" also features a bonus crossover episodes between ""Law and Order"" and ""Homicide Life On The Sreet."" In this season, it also features Benjamin Bratt in his final season of the show as Detective Rey Curtis."
3,Good season All Around,"I am a big Law & Order fan, and I enjoyed the 9th year. I learned a lot about some of the characters' lives that I didn't know before during reruns on the tv. The only wierd thing about this set is the Homicide Life on the Street crossover is on the first dvd instead of the third or fourth. Otherwise, everything else was great, and I hope after the tenth year, they keep releasing them quickl."
5,TODOS HACEMOS COSAS CUYOS MOTIVOS NO ENTENDEMOS,"O QUE, DE PLANO SON CUESTIONABLES... Y HASTA ILOGICAS !Esas son las decisiones DEL CORAZON...Y por bien propio, ES IMPORTANTE COMPRENDERLAS PARA NO COMETER ERRORES VISCERALES !"
3,WARNING! NOT GIVEN A FAIR SHOT!,"I only see one review written on this particular guitar. Fair enough. Were all entitled to an opinion right? Well in this guitars defense, I don't believe the person who wrote it even owned the guitar. Pay close attention to what he wrote. Nobody even knows what brand this guitar is? If he bought it, he would have. It says J. Reynolds right on the advertisement and the guitar. How would he know if it was crap? I didn't buy it. I don't know either. It could be great. I had to give it a rating so I marked 3/5 for the paint. Someone buy this guitar before they do anymore rating please."
1,Cheap guitar,"This guitar is a cheap guitar. Sure it's not a bad price but don't be fooled. You're better of with an expensive guitar. I got a fender USA stratocaster, which is about $1000 but worth it since it will last so much longer and is so much better than this guitar is. And beware that it's not a Les-Paul guitar. That's just it's style. Even if you're a beginner, it's still not worth it. It'll be good for beginners for like 7 months or even less. No one even knows this brand!"
1,Not a Very Good Book!,"I was looking for an informative book on Roman History. I pulled this off the shelf and bought it because it looked like it covered all of roman history. I was pretty disappointed! This book covers only some history about four select periods. Although it had good maps and very good pictures this is not a complete overview. If you want good Roman History, read Asimov or the Complete Idiots Guide."
2,Upset College Student,"All math students get stuck on a problem, while that maybe irritating enough, looking for the answer in this book doesn't make your situation any better. So if you're anyway like me, you don't want to spend 1 hour racking your brain on one math problem when you have billions of other things to do and another millenium looking for a problem that remotely resembles yours in this waste of paper. I'm not trying to be discouraging to anyone looking for help, but I suggest that you just continue your search. I bought this book and I am now sending it back. So be your own judge. If you don't believe me, then my second suggestion would be to find the book in a book store and check it out yourself before buying it. Just being honest."
4,R4-G9,"The toy itself is durable and just as fun as any Star Wars toy out there. It even has the added feature of the retractable third foot that screws up and down as the toys head revolves. My only complaint is that the ""holographic planet"" that attaches to his projector tends to fall off after a few minutes. Still, I'm glad that Hasbro puts out Obi-Wan's droid as well as Anakin's R2-D2. He fits perfectly in the Obi-Wan Fighter produced by Hasbro, so overall I'm well pleased."
4,Different paint job on an R2 unit,This R4 unit is actually a different color scheme of the basic R2 D2 unit. The maroon and gold tones go very well with the ARC fighter by Hasbro. That's the big plus to this otherwise simple droid toy. The paint job could have been crisper but it is still a collectible piece of Episode 3 memorabilia. Recommended for ARC fighter owners and collectors.
3,NOT AN R4!,"This toy is increadably kewl but is deffinately not and R4 unit, it's an R2, althougfh it has an inaccurate name it is still and awsome looking and durrable little toy! a recomended buy!"
4,Tracing Papa's Travels,"This book retraces Papa's footsteps through the streets of Paris and Pamplona and weaves biography, history, and field notes into great stories about our greatest story teller. I intend it as a high compliment when I say that the book is an easy read. (I had no problem staying up late the day I got it and finishimg it the next morning over a few cups of coffee - except being late for work.) It turned out to be doubly rewarding when I decided to re-read ""The Sun Also Rises"" afterwards. ""Hemingway's Paris and Pamplona, Then, and Now"" is a great companion piece for Hemingway's first novel and I plan on bringing it with me when I make the trip to Paris and Pamplona myself."
4,"The Seine, The Seine","""""What a wonderful, moving tribute Burgess' paean to the Seine is. It almost brought tears to the eye of this long-time lover. As in the Kingston Trio's ballad of forty years ago, The Seine, the Seine, when will I again meet her there, greet her there, on the moonlit banks of the Seine?"" Burgess reference to Hemingway's autobiographical sketch of his days in Paris renewed old memories that this book rekindles every time I read it. Indeed, being the melancholy nostalgic that I am, I never read the final pages now. That way, I never finish it; and besides, I know how it comes out. ""...because Paris, indeed, is a moveable feast."""
5,Nothing like it out there,"and I mean that! I've never really found anything like this before. Never mind career counselors or job placement tests - if you want something that will be funny and entertaining - this is the game to buy. Game comes with 50 cards/ideas with 100 possibilities that will get you thinking your future, but with a little more sense of humor."
2,boring,I want to get my pilots license so thought this would be a good purchase but these series are just so unrealistic and fake and boring. I loved the movie though
4,"Excellent scholarship, not a travel guide","If you're looking for evidence that Israel really did make the wilderness journey described in Exodus, Ancient Israel in Sinai is the best scholarly case to be found anywhere, including the best collection I've seen of Egyptian linguistic evidence found in ancient Israel's cultic apparatus. But if you're looking for an examination of the wilderness route, not only from the Nile to Mt Sinai, but also from Mt Sinai all the way to Transjordan (as I was hoping to find), you may be disappointed. Hoffmaier does a wonderful job examining the first half of the journey, but devotes little attention to the second half. He does do a good job refuting the theory that Mt Sinai is in modern Saudi Arabia. I give it 5 stars for its scholarship, and 3 stars for the in-depth travel guide I was also hoping for."
5,Bible background support,"Extremely helpful to place the Exodus events in context. Hoffmeier does not try to ""prove"" the Bible, but instead assumes the historicity of the Exodus narrative. Bible scholars will find this helpful for interpretation and explanation of the OT narrative. Plus it offers support for the historicity of the biblical narrative without being sensationalist."
4,Shovel this one on onto your checkout cart.,"Must reading for all students of the Bible. If you already have some background in Middle Eastern History, you absolutely must add this book to your collection. If you like Kitchen's work, you'll like Hoffmeier."
5,Perfect for my Spanish Employees,"Kevin,Well done! I just got through it on a plane yesterday. I love the photos and the info. It is exactly what we need. My Spanish employees also agreed. I will read it again and again.Best of Luck,Mark Chisholm, TopClimb"
4,Very good book,"I read it many years ago, and one of the times I changed home, I lost it.Finaly found it again! Very good image about the IV Reich, and the influence of National Socialisn after the war finished.A must for any library!!!!"
3,DATED,The book is hindered by the fact that Bormann is dead by now and that many Nazis came here during operation paperclip to take up the cold war. He was too high up and evil to be sanitized and used here. Fairly interesting reading but very specialized. Book recounts various Bormann sightings here and there thus Bormann takes on the persona of a Nazi Sasquatch.
3,"Good, but small","This is much smaller than I expected. It runs on those little candleabra lights which aren't bright enough to serve as room light.The plus side is that it looks GREAT and it's heavy so when my cats run into it they don't knock it over, breaking it (which also allows me to not kill my cats, so that's a good thing). The quality seems very good as well.So buy it if you're looking for a small lamp for an end table, or just want to show off your favorite team in a cool way, but if you're looking for something that will light up the room? Get something else."
3,Small lamp,"Uses a small bulb, not standard. Cannot use energy efficient light bulb either. Cord is pretty short, but the lamp itself is asthetically pleasing"
3,Queit Little Movie,"Thoroughly enjoyable, well-acted and worth seeing. Annoyingly simplistic, even borderline absurd ending. Should have been longer, with a proper denouement.Still, entartaining as whole.Also, several actors from ""It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia,"" so yay."
1,Save your money,"I am not one to write reviews, but I feel I must on such a disapointing product. My son got this for his second birthday. It is way too hard for a two year old to understand. The crane always gets tangled and it is very difficult for him to determine which piece goes where. He never plays with it and we will be throwing ours away to make room for christmas toys (its not even worth giving to good will). I will say we do have several other bob the builder toys and all are great. My son's favorites are the phone and scoop."
3,a lot of political context and very few fighting,This is more a political documentary instead of a boxing one.I would like to have seen more of the important fights (vs Macho for example) than the Colosio case.
3,"Not every book has to be ""War & Peace""...","If you take this book for what it is--a light-hearted, campy romp--you'll enjoy it."
1,Puerile and simplistic,"This book has no redeeming features - The writing is bad, the characters are wooden, it is neither funny or insightful. Don't Bother."
1,wrong information,"this is 4th edition, not 5th. i ordered it and they sent 4th edition. i requested for correction and they resent 4th edition again."
1,Very disappointed with Amazon....,"Just like the other reviewers, I ordered this item when the description said ""Organic Chemistry 5th + Solutions Manual/study Guide + Molecular Model Set"" and received the 4th edition. I sent it back and am waiting for my refund. This is the first time Amazon has failed me, and I am not pleased."
1,4th Edition,"Amazon does not have the 5th Edition in stock. If you order this, they will send you the 4th Edition."
3,BARRE JAMS ON NEW ALBUM !!!,"NOT seeing Martin Barre on the Rolling Stone's top 100 is further proof the BS that is that magazine. His guitar contribution to Jethro Tull, a yang for Ian's yin, if you will, is indissolubly united with our one-legged fourfingered bard; 21 studio albums (with the Tull Xmas album #21!), 500 million copies sold? OK; he didn't reinvent rock and roll; but an A-list player is an A-list player. He came up out of that Clapton's Creem style but quickly opted into a nice mold for Tull; perhaps even a bit heavy metal in his scalework and style, intermingled with a keen hand and above all: A GIANT HEART. Martin's style, more than almost anyone, is about the heart he puts into his performance and playing. This new album, if nothing more that something to throw on with the girlfriend over dinner, is a chance for us fans to appreciate this gentle, superb solist. For $13, it's not a bad deal..."
4,Enjoyable.,"I admit I don't love every track on this CD, but I think it's a fine effort overall. The acoustic pieces are uniformly lovely, and the electric pieces -- while not quite as consistent -- still deliver the goods. Probably the best solo guitar album you're likely to hear this year."
3,informative,"As a diarist, I enjoyed this book very much. It has a large amount of information about many, many diarists, and different genres of diaries. The author effectively conveys his enthusiasm for the topic, and it made me want to read many of the diaries in the book. (I found out that we only read the boring part of Pepys diary in high school English, and that there are all sorts of racy parts!)As interesting as this book is, there was a little too much breadth at times and not enough depth. So many diarists were discussed in each chapter that I felt I would have to take notes to remember the ones I was interested in. Also, the transitions between diaries are rather awkward; I think this book would have been better in an encyclopedic rather than narrative format.I think that this book is an excellent reference for anyone interested in the history of diaries."
4,Very interesting!,"I decided to buy this book because it was listed in a bibliography in one of my Wicca books. It's not my usual cup of tea, and it sat around awhile before I picked it up. Once I started, I couldn't stop. It was so interesting to get to have peeks into people's private lives. It really helped me to decide what I want to express in my own diary, and what I want to do with them when I die."
4,Excellent Learning Game,"An excellent toy to teach kids the benefits of planning ahead. If you try to play without planning it is very hard. However, if you do solve the puzzle by starting at the end (a type of planning), it's pretty easy."
5,Brilliant,"On top of the other reviews, I'd just like to add the following:The game has simple rules and a very clear goal of getting the guy to the destination. Despite the simplicity of rules and setup, the game can get very complex and has beautiful structure. This simplicity of rules and goal yet complex play make it extremely engaging for both kids and big kids like me."
4,Simple yet Sweet,"I love when a band comes along and doesn't have to get too intellectual with their songs and still manage to be smart and deep. That's what Reeve does. Their songs aren't too lyrically complex, which, in this case, is no criticism. You've got to appreciate an album like this. Songs about love and loss, and the misfortunes of youth. I've got few complaints about these guys. This is an album easy to get used to. Not too Indie to suck, not too mainstream to sound like their music's not from the heart. Hope to hear more outta this band."
5,"Great ""Mitad"" for injera","The Amazon listing says this is ""by SilverStone"", but Silverstone is the name of the non-stick coating. The manufacturer is Bethany Housewares (listed correctly for the Aluminum model).I use this as a ""mitad"" for making injera, the Ethiopian flatbread made from the nutritious grain t'ef, and it works very well. There is a nice lid for this available directly from Bethany Housewares for about twenty bucks. I'm sure any generic lightweight 16"" lid would work just fine, but you'll need some sort of lid if you want to make injera. Several websites recommended the non-stick model for injera (over and against the aluminum) and having made injera several times now, I think that was good advice. (You make injera on very high heat, covered, until the bread starts curling away from the grill, so maybe under those conditions the surface doesn't really matter, but I like how easily the bread slides off the grill on the Silverstone, having no actual experience with the other model.)"
3,Gives His Interpretation of Events,"One major advantage of reading a book of prophecy several years after it has been written is that one can see how accurate some of the predictions were. Perhaps that's why George Sweeting was so cautious in his comments in the foreward of this book. The author, Edgar James is also careful to qualify his statements throughout his writings. The historical background he provides goes all the way back to Genesis. Some of the prophetic interpretations of Scripture he sees involves a lot of changes that are yet to occur if his interpretation is correct."
1,"I HATE IT, WORTHLESS PLUG","I REGRET SPENDING 7.00 DOLLARS BUYING THIS PLUG FROM WAL-MART. I DIDN'T NEED A NEW PLUG, MY 128L HUSQVARNA WEED TRIMMER WAS WORKING JUST FINE. HOWEVER AFTER READING THE PACKAGING I THOUGHT HUMM, MAYBE I WILL SWITCH MY RCJ8Y CHAMP..PLUG OUT WITH THIS E3.12 SPARK PLUG. WELL TO MAKE A LONG STORY SHORT, AFTER 3-5 MIN OF USE WITH THIS NEW E3.12 PLUG I HAD TO REMOVE IT AND REINSTALL THE OLD PLUG. (RCJ8Y)SPARK PLUG. TO FINISH THE JOB. THE NEXT DAY I DECIDED BEFORE WRITING THIS REVIEW I WOULD GIVE THE E3.12 SPARK PLUG A SECOND CHANCE. WELL, THE OUT COME WAS THE SAME, AFTER 3-5 MIN OF USE MY 128L WEED TRIMMER WOULD CUT OFF AS IF IT WAS CHOKED OFF. THEN WOULD NOT RESTART. I WILL NEVER USE THIS PRODUCT AGAIN, AND WILL ADVISE ALL FRIENDS TO STAY AWAY FROM THIS WORTHLESS SPARK PLUG.IT IS POSSIBLE I HAVE A FACTORY DEFECTIVE PLUG BUT....IM NOT SPENDING THE MONEY TO TRY A SECOND ONE. I SEE SOME PEOPLE HAS WROTE GOOD REVIEWS, I AM NOT KNOCKING THEIR STORIES."
4,lightweight case that fits violin well,"We bought this case to replace an older one which had essentially fell apart. The case was shipped quickly and came well packaged. The case is very light weight for it's size and is covered with a black nylon weave that has held up well for the last 5 months of being trecked back and forth to high school. The inside has also held up well. My daughter doesn't use the velvet cover that is draped over the violin before closing. She says it's a pain to fit it in place. The carry strap has been the only piece that hasn't held up well. It's nylon weave is unraveling at the ends. Overall, a good case for the money."
5,Great workout!,"Ive only done the basic training dvd so far and that was a great workout! I think I will stick with that for awhile before I try the next one. Even if you dont have the bands it is very tough! Lots of cardio, and stretching. Great all around workout!"
5,Great!,"This is exactly what I expected from Billy Blanks! It's tough, it's high impact, and it's fast paced. Results already have started showing after only 2.5 weeks!!"
4,Good stuff,Delivery etc was good as I have come to expect from AmazonThe sound quality was good also. Chuck Berry cd's can be a mixed bag as far as quality goes. This cd is good and I am pleased to add it to my collection.Recommended
3,Oil of Love,"The Kama Sutra Oil of Love is great for late night ""love"" massages. It does warm on contact slightly and it doesn't stain the sheets. It has a great scent too. But if your serious about your massage oils,this probably isn't the product for you. It isn't as smooth or silky as most massage oils and it's a little sticky. But then again as the company says, it is ""only oil by name."" It's actually water based and edible, so it's good for action after the massage. Try the weekender kit, there is a small oil of love in that kit; you'll find out then if you want to by the larger container. Happy Shoulders."
5,"awesome, but sticky!!!!!!!!","This is a awesome oil, it smells wonderful and feels silky on the skin, my husband loves it...but use a waterproof pad or an old sheet because it does penetrate and leaves stains. It also turns sticky after a while, which can be fun, or you can jump in the shower!!!!"
2,"ok, not great",a little to sticky for our taste. kind of like a light syrup. definitely have to wash before you go to sleep or you'll stick to the sheets.
2,Not what I expected,"I had hoped for a special suprise and instead I ended up being disappointed... I remember my guy's first comment besides the funny look on his face was... ""It tastes like cough syrup!"" That comment sums it all up!"
1,DVD Player Stopped Working,"I bought this Toshiba with the the thought of saving space by combining the TV and DVD player. Shortly after the warranty expired, the player could no longer read DVDs (not copies of DVDs but store-bought, legal ones); this after one year of very light use (it's in a spare bedroom). Now I have a nice TV and no DVD player, so I'll end up having to buy a separate DVD unit anyway. I recommend buying separate units because if the player or TV has problems, the other is of little use."
2,Nice unit but aerator is horrible,Bought two of these mainly for the color. It's so hard to find a quality bathroom faucet in gold. The unit feels solid and it's easy to install. The handles are a little wobbly but I imagine they can be tightened. Haven't tried that yet. My biggest complaint with this faucet is with the aerator. It sprays water and it does not come out in a steady stream. I tried removing the aerator and resetting it but it still sprays water. I'm going to try and contact Danze for a replacement aerator which I hope solves the problem. Other than that the product is good.
4,World on a Wall,"Although I purchased this map as a guide for a quilt I was planning, I must note that it is well done and the size is an asset when working with a small space. My grandkids like the feel of it as well. Some of the print is rather small for my old eyes but the kids don't seem to have any problems with it."
3,Great bargain,This was a lot higher quality than I was expecting. It's great and I will recommend to my friends with kids.
2,Wrong Poster,I received the same size poster as I was suppose to be it wasn't the correct world map poster that I ordered. The poster was far less detailed then the poster that I ordered.
3,World Map Poster,"It could not be any better than this and, it should be a lot bigger!...It should be larger and, more ""precise""!"
1,Poor service,"I ordered this product early November and here it is the end of the year already and I have not received my order. It is sad, that the one item I wanted before Christmas never arrived. I have received several emails telling me it has been shipped but no tracking number and no poster. I will give it another week (2months) and then reverse the charges to my credit card which will end up costing them far more than the poster was worth. Sad, but what option do you have when you are not dealt with fairly?"
1,Misrepresentation,"What I got is not what you gave the impression I was buying.A WALL CHART.You would think it's a huge wall-size map, right ??Well, it's an itsy bitsy tiny weeny yellow polcadot-biniki like map, not even one (1) meter long and merely 60cm high.I wish I could send it back, but being outside the USA, this would cost me more than it's worth."
5,Great world map,"I've always liked geography and wanted to get my daughter started early. I use this map for countries and it is working out great. At 3 x 2 feet it's the perfect size. For states, I use a Rand McNally Road Atlas."
2,Too letters are too small.,"I don't know why others said this is good for the classroom. This is just too small, and I can hardly see the letters in it."
5,Great product,"Wish text was a little bit bigger, otherwise a great product. Arrived 2 days before the estimated timeframe. Would definitely recommend."
5,Nice Poster!,I got this for my 6yr old son as part of a gift. He really likes it and asks me lots of questions about the oceans and continents. I love that I can get something educational for so cheap that I can still afford to get him other things.
4,wish it was laminated,"The map is very large and relatively up to date but isn't laminated. I had to get it done locally, which ended up costing more than the map!"
4,good for the pice,"It's good for its price. comes in good shape, protected by thick paper board. good quality but a little smaller than I expected."
5,words is small,"packing is nice. only the words are small to read. the blue ocean occupy more space,leaving continents in small size as well as the words/markings."
1,Disposible bikes,Please examine the bottom bracket on a Huffy after a year and a half. You won't be able to keep the crank straight as you pedal. The rear stays are usually spot welded. Huffy traditionaly builds disposible bikes.
2,Big and heavy,"Instructions for this particular model are not included -- just general directions for ALL HUFFY BIKES, so basically it's impossible to tell if you're doing it right. I had to pay the local bike shop to finish the assembly, check the brakes, derailer, etc. because I had no idea if I'd done it correctly! Also, it's really big and heavy."
3,Good book except for one major problem,"This is a great book if you want to get familiar with a lot of tech (VB, ASP, MTS, SQL, etc) however it fails to mention an important road block until the 12th chapter.MOST WEB HOSTS do not allow custom dll's!!! The one's that do charge a hefty hourly fee to look over your source code, test it, and then install it (not including the usual setup fee and monthly fee). If you colocate your own box or if you have a dedicated server somewhere, then this doesn't apply to you.It's a great learning tool but I don't think it's practical to call it ""Beginning"". A much simpler shopping cart and checkout application written in ASP and using an Access backend would have been sufficient to learn the basic concepts behind a full blown ecommerce solution."
5,The Best Computer Book of the Year,I read a lot of computer books. Most of them are either too theoretical or not hands-on. But I'm so pleased that I have chosen this book. It is very praticle and I wish I had this earlier.
2,Not very good,"Well my title may be a little misleading, but for a book entitled ""BEGINNING E-Commerce"", it is not very good at teaching basic concepts. The author covers many things that a beginner may have a tough time grasping, such as building your own VB objects to connect to things like a database (Why not just keep it simple and do it straight out of ASP?). All the things he discusses could have all been done had he simply gave examples using VB Objects, actually explained them well, then simply used the same components straight out of ASP. If youre a beginner you may be dissapointed."
1,You can this a beginning book?,"This is book is a great -reference- book if you are some sort of wizard in developing vb components. :( Unfortunetely most of us don't host our own websites... and ISP don't usually allow custom dll's, so I didn't find this book very helpful."
2,Easy beginning and Advanced end,"Design of interfaces are not usually easy as the author show in their book. The Order Processing chapter is hard to understand if you don't have good knowledge about MTS. Finally the book have a lot of mistakes (some of then are reported in Wrox, but others not) In General the book it's OK, but only for Intermediate/Advanced programmers in ASP and VB."
3,THE BEST BOOK for E-Commerce,"I have been searching for the books on e-commerce, as I didn't understand anything what was taught in the E-commerce class. I was just waiting someone would help me with this course, but the wait was too long the semester got over and I got a 'C' in that course. But then I found this book in Amazon, now I think it is worth the wait. It starts off with the basic fundamentals of what e-commerce is(unlike other books), and goes on to exlain SSL,Structuring,Hosting and deployment,and Integration with other systems. Obviously the best being the last one. It's like a complete e-commerce book for beginners as well as professionals."
5,Implemeting this book in real world.,"Hi, I was brand new to E-Commerce, but not in VB, and ASP. However, this book has given me so much answers to what I have been looking for, that I am actually running Real time E-Commerce site using the theory and technique of this book."
4,Good all around for starters,Book is good all around for starters. I have looked at other books but this one has some depth and a good example web site. (At least the one that I was interested in.)
2,Be Careful About Homegrown VB Components,"There is a big ""gotcha"" in this book that most of the other reviews seem to have glossed over. To get some of the functionality, Reynolds has you build custom objects in VB. This can cause major problems when you are trying to find a host for your new web site. The author does point this out in Chapter 12 where he says ""Traditionally, ISPs (I think he means hosting services) don't like to put homegrown components on shared servers...."" Not only don't they like it, many won't! Since you build these components early on, you'll find that most of the work ends up being an intellectual exercise."
3,not a good book for a biginer,"The book is a good way to combine the Microsoft Technologies, and display how to build an E-Commerce store, however it has a lot of gapses in some chapters like 5,6. It starts out very knowledgable and then jumps to conlusions of the project, without showing the intermidiate steps to get to the solution of the problem. Don't buy this book if you are just starting out, start with begining ASP 3.0."
5,Serrat y su homenaje a la Nova Canco catalana,"El Nano repasa la historia musical de la cataluña pre-franquista de la mano de las canciones de los grandes exponentes de la nova canco catalana con un aire serratiano y con mucho respeto. Disco imprescindible para entender la historia reciente de esa gran región de España. Serrat fue criticado por algunos de aquellos que hoy canta por haber cantado en español, crítica injusta porque Serrat es hoy un ícono de Cataluña en Latinoamérica y siempre ha ejercido de catalán por los distintos paises que visita. Algunas de las canciones de este album son pequeñas obras maestras y ahí esta el Nano para ponerle su ""toque"" ,sacarlas del anonimato reducido y deleitarnos con su particular interpretación.Brillante."
5,"COZY, COZY",My Eddie (Yorkie) loves his Ed Sweater -- he goes to get it every day when we go out for our walks - he loves showing it off!!
4,Hot So Far,"I haven't gotten to check out the whole thing yet, but I have listened to a promo record containing six tracks, all of which are hot. If you like lyrics and E Double's production, this should definetly be worth your money."
3,Different Area.......,"This release is quite different from the Brian Setzer everybody knows. It almost seems like he wanted to fit in with the 80's glam scene. The songs weren't half bad though. ""Maria"" is one of the best songs on the album. It's worth a listen."
5,"Great amp, Great price.",This amp has been great so far and I would recomend it to any one want alot of power for a little price.
3,They've been better,"I've seen Acid King perform twice. Once they opened for The Melvins, and once they opened for Altamont/Angel Rot. Their split with Altamont is much better than what I've heard here. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy thick, slow stoner doom, but this album seems to be a bit too repetitious. Just about all the songs have the same tempo. I like a little variety in a an album...but that's me."
1,Free Will,"I think Mr. Lee's objecton to Kenny's statement about free will is quite reasonable. Kenny's statement is offensive and out of place in a work of this nature - even more so without supporting arguments. It cannot be excused by saying that we should learn to distinguish facts from value judgments, or that a certain amount of subjectivity is inevitable. Subjective statements, if not extreme or too many, are excusable to the extent that they do not deal with serious matters. But the question of free will is a very serious matter indeed."
4,Hard to describe.,"This is a typical Buckethead shred-fest, but it's different than his other albums. The recording quality isn't as polished as his other albums. It almost sounds like they recorded some of the songs and didn't do any editing to them. As a result, some songs sound ""live"" (in the studio, that is.) However, he plays so well that it's easy to look past this. ""Silent Scream"" and ""CS 118"" are excellent blues-type songs, and check out ""Braingate"" to see how ridiculously fast this guy can play! This is a must-have for Buckethead fans. The reason I give it 4 out of 5 stars is because of the sound quality and a bit of repetitiveness, but that's easy to look past, as there are several stand-out tracts."
5,Cobra Strike is..,One of Bucket's best pure shredding albums. It's almost non stop pure awesome. One of my faves for snowboarding.
4,Check this band out!,This band writes some of the sweetest melodies around. Great live and there seems to be no end to new ideas for songs. If Crowded House grew up on the prairies they'd be the Waltons.
5,"Embodies a pure love of country life, despite its hardships.","Portuguese singer Lura presents M'bem Di Fora (""I Come From The Country""), her second North American music CD album, which draws heavily upon her love of her countryside home, and the unique musical traditions of the Cape Verde islands. Cape Verde is a semi-arid island string of ten islands hundreds of miles from mainland Africa; each island has its own distinct rhythms, and all of them formed inspiration for Lura's lively music anthology. From the hope of people waiting for rain to return, to the ambience of midsummer celebration, to the song about a daughter who fell in love with a poor islander rather than fulfill her mother's dream of marrying a rich foreigner, the songs of M'bem Di Fora embodies a pure love of country life, despite its hardships."
3,Still a good series but it is becoming a little too predictable.,"The product arrived in excellent condition. I have no complaints in that regard. The series is still very good, although it has become a little too predictable in format."
4,Great season,"Great dvd set, the only problem concerned the lack of a episode guide on the dvd case. Otherwise it was an awesome packet."
5,awesome,The 10th year is a great year for Law and Order. I enjoy all the Law and Order shows. This year was especially awesome.
2,Law & Order The tenth Year,"All crime series eventually decay into soap operas & this process was well under way by L&O; 10. Several of the episodes were harbingers of L&O; SVU which I personally loathe. Several other episodes had almost incomprehensible or utterly unconvincing plots. Slim pickings for L&O; fans, but (just about) better than nothing.The physical product was fine, the acting & direction were OK, the plots were not."
3,"Works well, but a pain if your a Mac user","The product works very well, doing exactly what it's supposed to do. The difficulty is in setting the bridge up. First, it doesn't come with a Mac version of the setup program, nor does Linksys offer one on their site. Luckly, I have some VM software that let me run Vista. The next problem is that the setup doesn't quite work right in Vista (go figure). If you run setup.exe in Windows XP compatabilty mode, it works fine. Since then, it's been chugging along just fine.In short, run the setup in Windows XP compatability if you use Vista. If you use a Mac, get a VM (e.g., Parallels or Fusion) or Bootcamp and a Windows license, or have a friend bring over their PC."
2,"Doesn't work well with Mac, poorly supported","Five different phone calls, being switched around the globe to the wrong technicians, and two and a half hours after beginning my ""Quick"" Setup...I'm told I can only install using a Windows PC running XP, or to simulate XP vers 3 in my compatibility mode on my mounted version of Windows 7 (tried that, still doesn't work). The error is ""communication error, connection lost"" when it's supposed to be recognizing available networks. THANKS LINKSYS!"
2,Nice form factor... no WPA,This product is a miss. Designed to wirelessly connect VOIP phones to a network it does not support WPA Enterprise. Forget about using it in any corporate environment.
5,Great bike -- and inexpensive too!,"Don't listen to the people that say it is difficult to assemble. I put it together in a few minutes! very easy assembly! Sure, you need a few tools, but what do you want? Please! don't gripe over nonsense. If you wanted the easy way out - go to a bike shop and buy one assembled.I purchased this bike as part of the friday sale for 69.99 + free shipping. I didn't expect a 500.00 bike --it is excellent for the money spent and will serve it's purpose. If this goes on for the friday sale again, I will be purchasing another for another family member!Thanks!"
4,A big Rihanna fan,"I have been a big Rihanna fan since she came out. She has a beautiful voice, she can dance and has great videos. Watching this dvd only makes her more real, because you know what it took for her to make it to where she is now. And this dvd is about Rihanna and how she became who she is not just watching her videos."
4,Impressive...,"Though I'm not really a fan or know too much about Rihanna my girl is and does. I sat down and watched it with her a couple nights after it arrived, and was actually impressed with her story! I'm still not a fan of her music but this DVD is a pretty good documentary."
5,Brighton Chair,"I am very pleased with the quality of this product. I bought four different colors of the chair, and I love them all. The paint color is true to the picture. The chairs are sturdy and can easily support an adult if you are looking to sit with your child at the table for any period of time. I also thought it was fairly easy to assemble, and that is coming from a mom not a dad :) This product might seem pricier, but compared to similar chairs from Pottery Barn or Land of Nod, it is much more affordable, and just as cute."
2,KidKraft Brighton Chair-What a disappointment!!,"I ordered this chair for my 7 year old daughter (who is on the small size) for her desk. It states for ages 5-8. NO WAY!! I received the chair today and was in shock to see how small it was!! My 5 year old twins are even to big for it!! Although it seems to be a well made chair, it would ideally fit a child ages 1-4. They should change the age decription so people dont have to go through the problem of returning this item time and time again!"
2,Not Designed for a Desk,"I was looking for a desk and decided on the Reflections Pearl White Student Desk by Thomasville via amazon.com. During the search Amazon recommended this chair to go along with the desk and offered a discount for buying the 2 together. This chair, however, is TOO SHORT to be used at a desk. The seat is 8 to 10 inches too low. When my granddaughter sits in the chair the desk comes to her neck. I would not have chosen the desk if Amazon had not recommended it to compliment the desk. I then had to go and buy another chair."
5,Brighton Chair awesome!,"I wanted a table and chair set for my granddaughter for Christmas, couldn't find a set like I wanted to for what I wanted to spend. I found these chairs, they shipped immediately and they are wonderful. Very heavy quality, they are not a cheap ""kids"" set. The are oversized, should last her for years.....and then they become an heirloom.....great company to order from, great chair."
3,Disappointed,I ordered the KidKraft Brighton Chairs and Table for my granddaughters for Christmas. Less than 6 months later the Pink Chair had to be repaired and now I'm hoping it will hold up after that repair. I researched a lot and found this product had high marks and I wanted a sturdy set for the Grandchildren. It is disappointing and embarrassing to give a gift which does not stand up even for 6 months. I would be hesitant to add 2 more chairs to this set as I had plannedBrighton Chair
2,Too small,"I bought this chair because it was recommends to go with a 4D Concepts Kids Desk sold by Amazon. I had to return it because it was WAY too small. My daughter is an average sized 7YO. When she sat at the desk in this chair, the desktop was at her upper chest/neck. This is a kiddie chair meant to be used with a toddler desk. Otherwise, it was fairly easy to put together, seemed fairly well made. Just be aware that it is very small."
3,Limited to 3???,"I wanted to buy four chairs to make up a set with a table I have. Why in the world would I be limited to buying only 3 chairs of the same color? I placed the order hoping to then purchase a single chair but the order was denied. There was nothing obvious on the order site indicating that there were limited quantities, so what's the deal?"
4,Nice little chair!,We bought this chair for Xmas for my 6 yr old. It is just the right height for her child-size desk. For use with a standard sized desk it would be too small. It is perfect.
2,Very disappointing!!,"I recently ordered the white table and four chairs for my daughters for Christmas. It is an adorable set, - BUT - I was VERY DISAPPOINTED when I received the order. I found that the table was cracked and the drawer glides were installed incorrectly, so the drawer can not even be used! Plus, they neglected to send one of the chairs!!I sent an email to the company to explain the problem. They finally sent the chair 2 weeks later, but I still have not gotten a response on the broken table after nearly one month! To make matters worse, the chair they sent had a rotten leg. So it broke the very first time my fifty pound daughter sat on it!!I have once again emailed the company. I hope I get a response this time!! I am tired of making up stories for why Santa and his elves have not taken care of this problem!!!"
3,any more coming?,i read this book ages ago and would love to see the author come out with more tales of these intriguing characters. what's taking so long?
5,A fantastic Adventure,"First, too bad peeranha@aol.com from mozambique does even realize there are no chapters. That's ashame, because if they had actually read it, they would really have enjoy the drunken narrator's style, the many stories, the novella, all the poems, illustrations, journal entries... The book has quite a lot to offer anyone who actually reads it. Mozambique, perhaps you should stick to children's novels."
5,"Fantastic! Literally. Artistic, post-modern brilliance.","Not only is the wine bottle this book comes in beautiful (worth the cost alone), an inspiration to the creative heart and mind, but a perfect way to receive this artistically literate novel. The Drunken Narrator is so sardonically funny, at times so closely entwined in my spirit, I am given the power it takes to fight this heavy world off during the most tremendous times. And the stories! How William Kolasa conceived of such a design for a novel is at times beyond comprehension. The novel has four stories beginning, continuing, ending at varrying times, along with the poems and expression, and the art work! Lucas Kolasa's drawing are prolific expressions of the novel's being. Simply a beautiful book that everyone should read and possess. Marcus Aurfolio, NY, NY"
1,"""An Interlunar Blunder""","Where does one begin? Perhaps the bottom of the trash heap, because that's where this book belongs. But the CONTENT of this ""'masterpiece'"" (lol) is what really turns my tummy. For example, the world ""prothetic"" should have been replaced with ""pathetic"". This author invents words since he is not creative enough to grasp the nuances of the English language. Should be made standard reading for graduates of the Braille institute, because only a blind person could enjoy this. I've read fortune cookies with more substance."
3,"Shows signs of dating, but still some interesting stuff inside.","There are a few standout exhibits in the book. Many are dated and look like the early 90's web design failures though. Its worth 3 bux if you can find it used though. It will give you an occasional inspiration and at that cheap of a price, its not a total waste of money. Not great though."
2,not usable,"what a disappointment- looked real promising until i tried to set it into the wall- one end kept sticking out- laid it on a flat tile floor and found out why- frame is not straight and one end is about 1/2"" off- mirror door doesnt even close all the way? poor quality control!"
3,Huge fan and a little disappointed with this one...,"Why fix it if it ain't broken? These classics have been re-recorded and the end result is not nearly as good as the original cuts. Too heavy on the keyboards/instrumentals and weak studio mixing wrecked ""Let your Love Flow"" on this compilation- real bummer. The vocals on the live tracks overpower the instruments- usually it's the other way around with live recordings. If you're ok with that, then this compilation will be a ""fair"" addition to your collection."
2,Disappointed - Not original,"I didn't look closely enough (at reviews) when purchasing. Didn't listen (no option to listen). It is a remix or rerecord, not original. So, I've ordered again, the originals. Must have, especially Let Your Love Flow, my all time, will play it at my funeral, fave; it is who I am; connects with my very cell! Would I stand for anything but the original? Not."
2,NO LYRICS ON THE SCREEN!!!,I was expecting for this CD to have lyrics on the screen but it doesn't...How disappointing!
5,Interesting information,We have an old black powder rifle in our family and this book provided interesting information that I distributed at the next family re-union.
4,Interesting!,"Enjoyed this non-genre book by Mr. Moseley. It explained some of the mystery surrounding Robert Johnson and why people were so enthralled by him. The main character was a pathetic soul until rescued from the trash heap by Kiki. Their platonic relationship created their salvation, as she found a purpose to live and Soupspoon finished his life searching out is past. I found the characters realistic and also pitiful. Moselys' gift is to transport the reader back in time and show him the rich history that makes up our culture.I recommend this book to music lovers and lovers of fiction everywhere."
5,Mosley's language captures the power of the blues.,"I love music, but I know very little about the blues. I had heard of Robert Johnson before I read this book-but I knew nothing about him, really. Half way through this book I felt compelled to stop on my way home from work and buy the Robert Johnson Anthology. Mosley does for storytelling and language, what Johnson did for the blues. If you read the book, you'll understand that this is an enormous compliment. One that Mosley would probably shy away from, but don't let him! The story is hard and sad, beautiful and funny and full of terrific charcters - much like a good blues number. The only thing that stops me from gibing this book a ""10"" is the quick way that Mosley more-or-less disposes of the Kiki character at the end of the novel. Soupspoon's passing is both beautiful and memorable. Kiki's felt like the goofy adendum's that appear at the end of ""American Graffitti."" A minor complaint though."
4,Does what is says it will do,"The essential tools, mat, blocks and strap are fairly standard in all the yoga videos. The video that comes with it does give a good demonstration of how to use the equipment, but does not give an exercise routine of any length. For the price some venders charge for this kit, it seems that the video could be more encompassing... particularly since it is package with VHS instead of DVD in the DVD age. At Amazon's price, it is a fair deal for the equipment you get if you aren't expecting it to come with a work out video. The video is only a demonstration video... no real substantial workout. You'll have to buy an extra video or DVD for that."
2,yoga kit,The yoga matt itself is ok but it comes with a video TAPE and unfortunatly I don't have a VCR anymore. Maybe it could be updated to a dvd.So therefore I still don't know how to use the yoga kit properly.Franziska
1,Got goo gone and an evening free?,2 big nasty stickers on the bottom of each glass. Several defects in glasses as well as being very thin walled and thus more easy to break. I would not recommend these to others.
4,"Good value, if it's on sale","I purchased the blue version of these glasses on sale for $3.62. At this price, I would consider them a good deal, despite a few defects. They are basically decent glasses, not too heavily weighted on the bottom. Because of the extra weight on the bottom and the large circumference they are fairly sturdy, but can be a little bit difficult to hold if you have small hands. The frosting on the glass is NOT perfect, pretty uneven in fact, but you don't really notice if you aren't staring at it. To clarify the other review, the glass' walls are about 2 millimeters thick, by my measurement. Not so thin, but the quality of the glass (not so good) makes it feel fragile. Also, they do come with stickers on the bottom, but I had no problem peeling them off, and the residue was easily removed with soap and water. For the price I paid, I am satisfied with the product."
3,"cheap, made in china",Reasonable price when i bought it with discount.Made in China. Buy it only when discount happens
2,Are we playing the same game?,"Maybe I picked up a rogue bootleg copy of this PSP title, but it seems like everybody else here was diggin on this and I was just..well not. The missions are repetitive, the variety of guns/armor/villains are nonexistant, and the aiming on the wee PSP screen is barely a pinprick. It's also shorter than any video game I've every played. Side by side to GTA Vice City stories this is basically a mini-game. I'd say if you find it used for less than $10 and need something to do on an airplane go for it. But if you're playing the PSP as a gaming engine in and of itself, take a pass."
5,Refreshing new songs and great learning concepts,"I'm a huge fan of the Richard Scarry DVDs and videos, and this one is certainly amongst my favourites. It is delightful to learn and sing some new songs with my 15 month all that can teach her about opposites, the alphabet, counting and shapes. The tunes are catchy, the music is appealing and the lyrics are well sung. Very sweet and simple, perfect for toddlers! I don't see myself getting sick of this video any time soon, whereas if I hear ""Wheels on the Bus"" and ""Old McDonald"" one more time...."
5,Best Learning Songs Video EVER!!,My 2 year old son absolutely loves loves loves this DVD. He learned all the songs quickly and loves to sing and dance along with the characters. I highly recommend this to anyone with a toddler!!
2,"Poor value, mediocre production","My daughter loves these books...but gets bored easily by the DVD. The quality of animation, story line, and sound quality was average to poor. From a parent's standpoint, also a poor value for the dollar - very short length for what you pay...doesn't keep the kids entertained for long."
1,I threw this one away,"I had some high expectations after reading many positive reviews. But my kid had no interest after 5 minutes of viewing. Furthermore, the bad sound quality really bothered me so much that I had to throw away this DVD. For young children, good quality audio (music, verses, etc.) is a must, and this DVD doesn't deliver that. There are alot of noise from the start to finish. I think the songs are ok (not good), but it's hard to hear the exact words because of the noise problem. I think this DVD was a straight transfer from VHS.I think people should avoid this DVD."
2,for older kids OK,"I don't think it is for babies as they advertise, too coplicated and not enough colors, my baby did not like it... baby einstein DVD are the best for babies"
2,Active boys didn't pay attention to them,I liked them but our 2 & 5 yrs olds didn't find them interesting
5,"Well, it's wax. Pretty simple.","It's good wax, if you need wax. Availability of this product is hit-or-miss locally, and lately it's mostly been ""miss."" Enter Amazon.com! Right now it's under six bucks with Prime. If you need a quality wax it's cheaper than driving around town. I use the stuff to coat jute twine and cotton balls to make waterproof tinder for camping & backpacking. It serves that role very well, and a pound is pretty much a lifetime supply.Good stuff."
1,Royal Oak Paraffin Wax,"I was very, very disappointed with this order. The wax came to me , not in a regular box just the wax in a brown packing box, I have no ideal if this is the wax that I ordered and paid for. I would never send someone a order like this. I do not recommend this seller to anyone. Very un- professional to say the least. I would never order from this seller again. I threw the wax in the garbage , no way could I use this not knowing what on earth it is and who made it."
1,Wax,The wax was shipped quickly. But it was kind of expensive for only 1 lb of wax. This listing was also misleading to me because it was a little difficult to figure out how many pounds it was.
5,Great,"I ordered this product because our aluminum sliding doors were not sliding smoothly. I rubbed it on the tracks and ZOOOOM, they're moving now. Unbelievable."
1,sad day to review the Gaithers,"did not think this was a good Karaoke song cd at all, the songs were some of the lost pieces that they would not sing on the road and not fun at all, Where is the Good Ol' Gospel Music we all like????"
3,From Back Cover,'HE'S BACK--WHAT WILL I DO?'The answer to that question--and any coherent thought--deserted Maxie Parrish when Sergeant Kyle Hayden was assigned to her ranch. Maxie had no choice but to usher her new boarder inside and safeguard her somersaulting emotions. Because she had someone else's beart to consider...'WILL HE FIND OUT?'That answer grew harder to face as this single mom saw how seven years had changed the once-danger-seeking ex-marine. His sable-colored eyes now offered her forever. But Kyle had yet to open her old letters and read Maxie's confession that her most protected secret...was also his daughter.
3,not white,"Not as the picture shows. It is not white, but tan with grey siding. Otherwise it looks good.I have not tried it for function yet."
5,Magical,"This was the first Alice Hoffman book I've read, and I did so last week. It was a breath of fresh air. Beautifuly written, without being 'over-written', and almost magical. It is a story centered around a time where things were rapidly changing..the late 50's. I can easily say it is one of the best books I've read this year.Some of her prose were so lyrical I almost had the urge to haul out a highlighter. It certainly won't be the last Hoffman book I read."
2,put me to sleep,"I didn't care for ""Seventh Heaven"". After the first chapter, it went downhill.The writing literally made me fall asleep."
3,Divorced in the 1950's with 2 kids: Taboo and no easy task,"I was hoping for so much more! Interesting insight on life as a divorcee in the 50's. I lost respect for Nora (the main character), due to her irresponsible, lustful behavior (similar theme in Hoffman's ""Here on Earth"")."
3,Decent portrayal of suburbia from a feminist perspective.,"I was recommended Hoffman by my sister and decided to check out what she is about. A smidge of magic realism mixed with a portrayal of a community and the characters that comprise it. As a man who holds some distaste and disdain for my suburban roots, I enjoyed the pinpricks at the balloon of suburban conformity. I was also genuinely surprised by this book at points, especially in the Ace/Nora axis.I was not fully satisfied with this book, but I feel that any dissatisfaction reflects my own situation more than the authors' failure to achieve her aims. The change agents in this book are women who throw off the shackles of an imprisoning 50s ideal of woman and the children these women have birthed. The men in this book do not grow in the same kind of ways.I may read more Hoffman to develop a greater understanding of her work. I feel that I have read a good book but I may not be the intended audience for it."
4,Interesting and accurate presentation of LI life in the 50's,"The above book description just about says it all, and there's not much I can add except to say that I enjoyed this book very much! Deeply developed characters, a familiar setting, and very detailed (and seemingly accurate) glimpse into what neighborhood life was like on suburban Long Island 45 years ago, and how it compares to my own lifestyle here now. I definitely felt drawn into the community and related to the characters as though they were my own neighbors."
3,A quick read that doesn't reveal any mysteries of life,"Nora longs to fit into a neighborhood, to become a respected member of the community, but she is rejected because she is so different from her neighbors. Divorce makes her different; none of the other Hemlock Street mothers even know a divorced person. There is an unspoken fear that accepting her will accept the change that is certain to happen in the neighborhood. We assume that life was tidy in the '50s. This book reveals what we know is really true. Life never moves unendingly on the same track. Change is always a part of life. Even though the '50s were sedate, change happened throughout the entire decade. The Hemlock Street neighbors fought unsuccessfully against the threat of change that they perceived Nora would bring. In truth, they each formed a monumental change in their own lives and, of course, in the life of the neighborhood."
2,I was expecting far more from such a renowed writer.,There was no real strong connecting bonds between the characters. Far too many characters were continuously introduced and consquently it was difficult to feel that you got to know any of them in depth. There was no real theme that you could get a hold of and the ending followed suit as I found it rather meaningless. Also she didn't really have a good handle on what the late 50's were really like. Heck I was a teenage babysitter in the late 60's and all I got was 25 cents an hour....I was absolutely amazed that Nora's teenage babysitter got paid 4x that amount!! This was the first Alice Hoffman book I have read and it was a let down.
2,One of the worst Alice Hoffman novels,"I'm an Alice Hoffman fan, having read her short stories and some of her more recent novels. Seventh Heaven was a disappointment. At the start, the theme of estrangement among the women in the transition from the 1950's to the 1960's seemed promising. But the characters were shallow and were never fully developed. The prose seemed distant and not particularly insightful about any of the characters' interior lives. Her novel the Ice Queen had an emotional intensity/depth and beautiful metaphorical imagery that was completely lacking in Seventh Heaven. I would recommend other books by Alice Hoffman but I wouldn't recommend this one."
2,A plodding book,I enjoyed The Dovekeepers by Alice Hoffman so much that I decided to give another of her books a try.I wondered why I persevered with Seventh Heaven as it was laborious reading.
3,Seventh Heaven,"This book had potential to be a very good book, but fizzled in the end. With elements of the paranormal, Alice keeps you on your toes wondering just what is going to happen, only to find out nothing really happens. If you are intersted in a great Alice Hoffman read, try The Third Angel! I loved this book."
5,Very Good Cases in Systems Analysis and design,"There is not much I can say about this book. The book speaks far better for itself than ever I could hope to. I congratulate the author. I had read lectures on Systems Analysis and Design to Graduate Students (not on informatics)and my reference book was this one. Obviously, authors applied their past experience to present a complex task in a very amenous and readable way. Of course, I will use it again in my next courses. Some years ago, I used several times in my courses, with good results, the book ""Systems Analysis and Design. Best Practices"" by the same authors."
4,Bring back the memories,"I bought this for my husband and after listening to it realized I need to get it for myself. It is fantastic. It has so many great songs. If you're a Skynard fan, you can not be without this collection!"
2,Not their best!,"This is a good CD set, but not the best that Skynyrd has to offer. I recommend you pass on this and get the original albums instead."
3,Deception on the 2nd CD,"Swamp Music, Bullets and Things Goin' On are all remade by the new Skynyrd. Sorry Johnny, you don't sound enough like Ronnie for me to enjoy hearing you sing his songs."
1,greatest hit part 33!!!!!!!!!,"Another greatest hits album! What?There is nothing on here you need.It has all been released on countless other ""greatest hits"" albums.This one was done to add a couple of their newer lame tracks.Another attempt at a quick buck off of the legend that is becoming a joke.Don't buy this!You will be glad you didn't."
4,Cut 'em a break,"OK, Thyrty is no Gold & Platinum, but I've gotta stick up for the decision to include the demo tracks, especially ""Need All My Friends to Talk To"", which has gotten an unfair trashing here. It's a really lovely little piece of simple vocals and guitar/bass, and if you listen to it carefully, you can hear the building blocks for 3 different later hits: ""Comin' Home"", ""Down South Jukin'"", and even ""Free Bird"". Say what you will about late CD compilations but I really love the trend towards including demo tracks. Just like DVD extras, some of them are terrible, but some of them are a really interesting, rawbone glimpse into what the band was gonna become."
5,AWESOME!!,"I'm a 14 year old guy in the 9th grade. For about two years now, 60s, and 70s rock has been coming back FAST! This is one CD I bought when I began listening to Lynyrd Skynyrd, and this CD will KEEP me wanting to listen to them. This CD is most deffinitly worth the money!"
5,Lynyrd Skynyrd 30,Great album from the greatest band. Great list of songs- why wasent travlin man on it? but oh well great album none the less.Free Bird
4,Gonna Get me Some of That,"You can not deny the place in Rock 'n Roll that Lynyrd Skynyrd holds!! Call in Southern Fried Rock if you wish, it ain't nothin but good time music comin' down. The dual guitar lead and the hard drivin' rhythms make this one band you can not deny had all the power to kick some serious butt. This is a great collection to have !!"
2,Defective cap,"I've had it a few weeks and use it to take soup to work for lunch. After a few uses, the insulated cap has started to fail. Thecap itself is defective - the seal between the disk in the top of the insulated cap and the edge of the cap is not air tight. Also, one must be careful not to overtighten, because overtightening distorts the gasket, and leakage can result when thermos is place on its side - I got chicken broth all over the back seat of my car. It does keep things hot, but now I have to be sure that it is upright at all times. Not the foolproof system that I had expected. Stanley, here I come!"
5,My Husband Love it.,"My Husband love to eat homecook meals...hot soups & vegetables. He works in the construction field so not all the time the sites have microwaves...therefore his meal may get cold or he have to buy out. While, I purchase this thermos and his food stay hot all-day. He said this is the best thermos he every had."
5,"A steamy, yet funny read. I recommend it.","This book is not only steamy, it is extremely funny and pun-ny too. The story of the founder of Chippendales and the way he started the first club in Los Angeles was fascinating.The book is so descriptive that when I read about various European cities, I felt like I was there.Not many guys would pass up the opportunities Troy Kline had to perform with the world famous Chippendales and have women falling all over them night after night. I commend the man for finally seeing his instant celebrity for what it was and realizing he needed to make a major change in his life.I thoroughly enjoyed the book and am looking forward to the sequel.Cherie, Band singer."
5,Karaoke Pop Hits - No Karaoke Machine Needed!,"This a Fully Loaded Karaoke DVD with Vocal Guides on all Tracks, Full Video or Blue Screen, and it Plays on All DVD Players.

2,Milton Avery,"Pictures reveal an interesting approach, quite different than predecessors with its flat shapes and distinctive coloration. The text, however, remains a pedantic driven piece of trivization of analyses upon analyses that resemble nothing more than a laborious exercise of an overinflatted academic egotism lacking, for the most part, informative substance."
1,I ordered it and it wasn't in stock and they cancelled my order.,I ordered it and it wasn't in stock and they cancelled my order.
3,Excellent characters and plot; heavy political/racial agenda,"Randy Alcorn has done an excellent job of creating an absorbing plot, peopled with realistic, three-dimensional characters. However, the constant intrusion of comments about race relations and the black experience in America are at first distracting and then annoying, as they do absolutely nothing to advance the plot. In a book of this type one expects the standard conservative fundamentalist Christian agenda; it comes with the territory. But add on top of that the repetitive and unnecessary narration of events of black history, and we end up with a lot of extra verbiage which in my opinion does nothing but add extra pages to what is otherwise a good, multidimensional story."
4,"Read Alcorn's Deadline first, but then be sure to read this",Great plot along with much thought provoking info about blacks in America
3,"Good plot, tough read","I enjoyed ""parts"" of this book. As long as the plot remained on Clarence Abernathy and his search for his sister's killers, the book was interesting. Once we started getting into his sister's afterlife experiences, it got stale. I found myself skipping pages to get on with Clarence's activities. Characters like ""Zeke"" began to really annoy me. The constant barrage of ""ebonics"" got stale as well, but I know it was necessary for the story and was at least contrasted in the intelligence of Clarence. It just needs to reduce the lengthy ""afterlife"" scenes."
5,Dominion,"Enjoyed this book most of all the three in the series. The detective story was pretty intense, sometimes not very realistic but I enjoyed it."
3,A good follow up,"I did not enjoy this book as much as the first (Deadline), but it was very good.It followed up on some of the characters from the first book that were left hanging.I enjoyed it and would definately read both again."
4,Dominion,Randy Alcorn is writing the story in such a way that it's very difficult to let go of the book if you are busys reading. He describes heaven so good that I can envision it. Make me look forward of going there one day.
2,Not His Best,"I loved The Ishbane Conspiracy and Safely Home, but Dominion is a big disppointment so far. Admittedly, I'm only halfway through, but it has been torturous. If you want a book about God, this is not it. Read his others. This book is about racism and slavery."
2,What I learned from this book,"All in all, the writing and storyline is excellent, though perhaps longwinded. Unfortunately, after reading only half of the book, I felt & still feel as though I were under spiritual attack; I could not finish the book. The magnitude of information on black/white racial history and gangs is OVERWHELMING. I learned from Mr Alcorn that all caucasian Americans are generationally culpable for the poverty, social ills leading to gang culture, and inequality of black Americans since the first black slave stepped foot on North America. Wow! No room for forgiveness in that lesson!"
4,Racism is a ploy of Satan!,"This was a little more difficult for me than most books I read because it is about, and uses the 'lingo' of intercity black teens, gang-bangers and the like but it was well worth the effort. It is an excellent book and really helped me see racial predjudice through the eyes of a black person. It made me more sensitive to the struggles my black brothers and sisters go through that I, a white woman, have never had to face. As in Deadline, to which I suppose this could nearly be called the sequel, it is full of spiritual truths that we all need to understand. I highly recommend it!"
5,Hard to put down....a great read!,"This is the second book that I have read by Randy Alcorn. As was the case with his first book, And Eternity, I could not put it down. The book focuses on racial and spiritual matters. It challenged me rethink my outlook on racial issues and concerns. The author provided characters who were real and alive. The characters are actively seeking out truth and justice for their community. Christian beliefs and principles are questioned and brought into focus for the reader. Mr. Alcorn has the ability to demonstrate his Christian beliefs and show his love for Jesus. I recommend this book highly."
4,Book Two Review,I love this series by Randy Alcorn - at least the first two books anyway. I would definitely reread them.
3,Not as good as Mr. Alcorn's other two fiction books,"I bought this for my husband for Christmas. We both read the first two fiction books by this offer (Safely Home and Deadline) which were wonderful!We were disappointed with this one. Too much time spent on things that were not important to story line. My husband did not enjoy it, although he did finish it. I haven't read it yet since he doesn't recommend it. I probably will read it eventually."
4,Great Mystery,"This was my first introduction to Randy Alcorn. I had a hard time getting into Abernathy's character to start with, probably because Randy was doing too good of a job portraying him. Soon I wasn't able to put it down. His introduction of the Carpenter surprised me and add much to the book.Ray Ruppert, Author of ""The Sovereign Reigns, or Does He?"" ""The Sovereign's Last Battle"" and ""Revelation: A Layperson's Reflections"""
3,Kids love it,"I agree this movie is awful if you're an adult, but my four year old daughter can't get enough of it. She has watched it over and over and over!!!!! As this movie was intended for kids, I think it's great."
1,Don't waste your money,"This is a very cheaply made plastic device. It is difficult to pull the cords out - they get stuck and one must release and hold the knob on the device while pulling the line...this becomes physically impossible for one person to do. Really a piece of junk. Wish I""d saved my money."
2,Wanted More.....,"From the inside cover I thought that this was going to be a good book. His Insignificant Other needed something more to it. I wanted to know more about Casey and Josh. The main character Casey has a low self-esteem and I wanted her to get back at John Paul for the way her treated her. Mali was something else also. But what did like about this book was that their was a different variety of characters in the book, and the situations that were in the book were real."
1,A waste of time,"I did not care for this book, this was one of the worst books that I have read this year. It goes in circles and it's horrible."
1,insignificantly boring!,"I was very disappointed with this book. The inside flap and the overall description of the story made it sound really good, however it was a book that I continuously fell asleep on. In fact, I am still not finished with it, and I doubt if I will. The main character seemed very insecure and every chapter you hoped that something different would happen instead of another scenario of her being in an atmosphere where she was questioning her boyfreind about his ex, Mali. Casey constantly worried and nothing happened. Hopefully she will do better next time..."
2,Not Very Significant,"The most entertaining part of the book was the first chapter. After that, I had to force my self to continue reading the book. I believe that Ms. Siplin had a great idea for a story line. However, it lacked continuity and a real development of the characters. The author had the ability to pull me into the story, but made it difficult to keep my attention. From what I understand this is a young author who I'm sure over time will grow in to an author that will write have a great story line with purposeful and interesting characters to go with it."
4,Great Book - Couldn't put it down,"I found myself not being able to put Ms. Siplin's book down. Even though I'm a guy, I still had had to know what Casey would do next. It's suspenseful, not in the sense of mysteries, but in the sense that most of us know of - who will call whom next, who will give in to temptation, who will find out what. A soap opera? I think it's more like our real lives - full of the insecurities people feel while in an unfulfilling relationship. There were no drawn out, dull descriptions of each and every character that wastes pages. Each character came to life through his/her dialoge with Casey - thus showing the reader who he/she was in relationship to Casey.The book is funny, and it touches everyone in some form - whether it's because we've been treated that way before, or felt that way before, put ourselves in that position, or just knew and watched someone being treated that way. Being an insignificant other is a part of life. It was nice reading about it."
2,Significant Character Flaws,"I'm sorry Ms. Siplin, but I had to force myself to finish this book (only because I paid for it and could not return it). I felt that the characters were underdeveloped (or maybe overdeveloped). Each character had so many things going on that they could have had their own book. I had a hard time believing that the characters were in their late twenties, I would have guessed late teens. I never got the sense that I knew these people or could relate to what they thought, said, felt or did. I waited and waited for the climax, but it never came. Sure, there were some unexpected surprises, but even they were weak. I walked away from this book, shaking my head because of the lack of connection with any of the characters. However, I was happy that it was over."
4,Interesting life of Cirque,"I thoroughly enjoyed this backstage tour, so to speak, however it left me wanting to see more of the show. I guess they want you to buy tickets! There were too many repeat shots, however, the edting made for an intersting programme. If you saw Fire Within, the making of Varekai you;ll enjoy this.Cirque du Soleil - Fire Within / Varekai"
2,meh.,"Well there's a lot T&A... and the interviews are okay but the annoying aspect of this DVD is it's just the producers fighting & worrying over how the show will be percieved (and then later panned initially) and it never shows you any worthwhile clips of the actual Zumanity long enough. Not even one act! I watched itonce, and haven't had the urge since."
1,Don't get me wrong but . . . ZUMANITY ?????,"I am a a huge Cirque fan. I have all their DVD's release shows and have seing many of them in person. WHAT AN EXPERIENCE. However, one of the show I am looking forward to see is Zumannity. I purchased the Cirque Du Soleil - Lovesick and that a disapointment it was. I was, sick. The DVD is a pre, pre, preshow of the making of, of the making of a show. I hope the show in NY NY, LAs Vegas is completely a different story. I booked my vacation to las Vegas for September 2006 and I off course to see the show. I will let you know them. Don't spent the money on the DVD and safe up for a trip.Axel Resto"

2,Don't do it.,"These Mega bloks dragon toys look great, but putting them together and getting them to stay together isn't easy. Take a look at the reviews...almost everyone says that they are difficult to assemble, the directions are bad, or they fall apart easily. Unless you want to assemble this...you, not your child...and then want to place it on the shelf so that they can look at it, don't buy it. Buy the Legos and spend the time putting them together. It does take longer, but at least they stay together and can be played with. My son (8) plays with the dragons but the other parts are stuffed in a bag."
3,Lot's of Fun,My son got all the sets for Christmas and he loves them all. The detail of the soldiers and dragons is amazing and much better than Lego. They don't stay together like Legos but then again they are also not as [much] as Lego's. I have had problems with some of the dragons falling apart and not staying together and stones not working but I am contacting MegaBloks so they can send me new ones... I especially like the Dragon Tower in the metal case. Although it is a great looking set this particular set falls apart all the time. The top floor won't stay on and my 8 year old can't even play with it. He is very upset and so am I since I can't return it as I threw away the box and mixed all the sets together in a huge bin. Maybe the other ones are better? I still have to put together 3 more sets but not today as this set frustrated me to the point that I wanted to throw it in the trash!
2,Don't buy Mega Bloks,My 6 yr old son found this very frustrating the pieces don't fit together very well. I recommend purchasing lego instead. I will never buy another mega blok product.
2,Dragons Sorcerer's lair,"I like playing with this set. The durability is low, but you can't expect better from Mega Bloks. I'm pretty used to bogus instructions, so that wasn't a big problem. I really liked the detail on the soldiers and the Dragons. Also, the ""secret"" weapons are pretty cool. This set kinda reminds me of the battles from LOTR."
5,Great set!,"Some thoughts on this set:--the dragon is very cool.--I like that the batteries can be replaced in the ""power stones"", other sets from other manufacturers sometimes don't account for battery replacement.--Gave it 4 stars for durability only because I wonder about the durability of the motor and gears that lift the ""scepter chamber"" out of the monolith (the kids screamed ""COOL!"" the first time they fired it up).--The knights are also great looking, but the joints in the figures legs seemed a bit loose, certainly looser than the joint on figures from other manufacturers.--The magnet in the dragon claw is very weak.--The dragon, the figures, and the castle walls are painted or colored to make them look more ""real""... not just a single, solid color throughout. It seems to be very colorfast --I've not noticed that it is chipable or wearing."
4,Lego's it ain't,"My son does love this toy, but it takes forever to get together and it falls apart very easily. It's a parent's nightmare! I feel like taking some rubber cement to it. Fun for the kids ""if"" you can get it to stay together. Why can't they make a toy like this with the Lego quality?????"
2,Hard to put together,At first this appears to be a great deal with lots of cool pieces like a dragon with eyes that light up and great looking knights however the pieces DO NOT hold together like Legos. My 8 year old son was very upset. The overall look is quite appealing but the instructions are vague and it does not stay together it just keeps falling every time he attempts to play with it.
3,"expensive, very hard to assemble, worthless instructions","This has all kinds of parts to play with, which is just what my 8 year-old son wanted, but it's EXTREMELY difficult to put together and the directions are practically WORTHLESS!!! I don't mind putting toys together for him and have assembled much larger and more complex toys before, but this is the absolute worst. The parts do not snap together easily and once together, you risk them falling apart frequently. Not only that, but the plastic seems brittle enough that it could snap if you put a lot of pressure on it (to try to once again snap together something that has fallen apart). The directions are so vague that I had to count the circles on each piece and match it to their diagram in order to determine where on it the next piece is to be placed. ...Even putting together the dragon (7 pieces) was hard, as one leg did not seem to want to snap in and it kept falling off. ..."
4,Fun - once it is put together,"We had bought the whole set. You have to keep in mind that these are not Lego's and they don't snap together as easily as Lego's do. Some of the pieces were quite hard to get in place (and I'm 28 years old). However, once we got everything together our son has had a great time with it. However, I am worried about taking it apart because of the few problems that we ran across putting it together. Overall, though, it is a fun toy."
3,Expensive cable for something that fails after a couple of years.,"Expensive cable for something that fails after a couple of years. Thankfully, InFocus now produces projectors that can use a standard VGA connection."
4,Nice change of pace...,"This tea has a little hint of citrus which works well with a very sort of mild green tea taste. The green tea part is very understated and not as strong as say Tazo, and you don't really notice the citrus until it's past your tounge. Like I said, a nice change of pace for green tea."
4,Funky Album,"A brilliant collection of mellow lounge tunes mixed with more up beat dance,think Nightmares on Wax crossed with DJ Shadow! This is a flight themed album which takes you through a calm and tranquil journey from take off too landing! Funky sounds which are a must!"
2,very disappointing,"The book is actually about how to program in VB for beginners, and the contents about the actual web development aspects are next to none. Examples do not work; online support is poor for that the author changed the online examples without changing the downloadable codes. Not worth buying at all."
1,No coverage of Server side scripting,"Since the primary use of VB Script is on the server side and the only reason I bought the book, I was completely disappointed to find no coverage of creating ASP pages or any other reference to server side activity. It also has no information on accessing databases - again because of the bias toward browser development. Save your money"
1,Not useful at all,"This book is more for reference to VBScript rather than learning VB script. I found the language extreemly difficult to read. It only deals with versions of IE less than 4.5. Not useful for learning or getting examples from, does not go into details in all the topics and explanations are usually not too helpful.Would be a waste of your money if you buy this book."
5,Very Unique and Well made,"Highly recommended if you are looking for something interesting, plush and durable. This is a great addition to our son's collection."
5,Great Buy!,Couldn't ask for a better plush octopus. Surprised me with how big it actually was when it came. Girlfriend loves it!
4,My son loves this!,"My son has a passion for ocean creatures especially the Octopus. I bought this for his birthday earlier this year and he absolutely adores it. Its now October and his bday was in January so for a solid 10 months, he has enjoyed this. The ONLY con with this, the seams separate easily. I've had to sew his up a couple of times. However, my son is 7 and plays a little rough when he pretends its the Kraken so that could be why the seams came apart. Its easy enough to sew back together though. Overall, this is a great toy!"
4,Awesome,"This octopus is awesome. It looks mean, it's large, it's soft, and it made a great gift for my brother (who is into this kind of stuff). It isn't horribly educational or anything, and I don't think it would survive a dog attack, but it's a great depiction of an octopus that any octopus fan would be happy to have."
5,Greatest stuffed animal we have!,"This toy exceeded my expectations and is so much fun to snuggle with. Highly recommend! I wouldn't necessarily consider it educational. but it certainly is imaginative. Very high quality, and durable."
4,Great quality,My seen year old son loves this! It is huge and a great bedtime companion for him. Our only complaint is that it smells a little funny.
5,fun and lifelike!,"This octopus is really great looking, with curved tentacles and beady eyes! It has a nice shape and it really big!"
4,good product,"i just switched from schwarzkopf ""man perfect"" and it is just more efficient.Pros: Work fast and do what it supposed toCons: much more expensive then in retail pharmacy, lock of good disposal to apply it evenly"
2,Choose a different one,"First off, I got this on the 4 for 3 promotion. It was free. It's worth being free, but not the price being sold for. The pin mechanism - I don't get it, in it's locked position it is safe, when it's not unlocked you may prick yourself, careful. The slicer is decent with wire cutters. But the wire cutter doesn't go through the entire egg leaving you with some egg left behind and not sliced. This is enough for me to hate this product. Just get a different one, trust me."
4,This is the book for beginners !!!,"Outstanding ! If you're new to VB, this bookis a must. The author uses some hilarious examples, and practical code to teach you howto work your way through VB.One caveat, this deals mostly with interface development in VB, if you want to learn about theheavy stuff (creating .bas files, compiling .dll files, etc) you'll have to look elsewhere.Other than that, this book is a great way to start working with VB"
1,The Ultimate Mystery--How This Got Published.,"A virtually impossible read, this book pretends to be like Richard Holmes' wonderful ""In the Footsteps of A Romantic Biographer"" but it most assuredly is NOT. Here, instead of footsteps, we have sink-holes. No sooner does a paragraph begin to entice interest, than it degenerates into incomprehensible ramblings. Rather than learning bit by bit in an engaging way about the wonders of turn of the century Paris and it's denizens--particularly Edith Wharton and her rakish secret lover, we learn only that the would-be biographer is an eccentric (not in a good way) confusing and addle-pated researcher who has no success with delivering the literary goods. A frustrating and disappointing waste of time. Avoid it like the plague!"
2,Tale of the Oyster,"Morton Fullerton, the only man to give Edie Whartona tickle, spent [almost] his entire life in Paris. Hewas the oyster who had a taste of society and societyhad a taste of him. (Let yer imagination go!, asBea Lillie admonished audiences).Mainwaring's 'creative' bio is of dizzying disorder.It reads like research, not a book. She asks Reader toaccompany her on sleuths to embassies and mayoral officeswhile she interviews. I thought she was ready to have anervous breakdown. Naturally I had to pursue every word.The players are fascinating. Morty had a m-f fan base,a brief secretive marriage and was blackmailed aboutletters fr Lord Gower - one of the UKs richest - andLady Margaret Brooke, the Ranee of Sarawark. Edie andH James helped pay off. As the oyster said, ""Let's nottalk about love."""
4,Lewis at work,"In one of his last professorial publications, Lewis delves into the history of several key words in the English language, both to learn how they came to mean what they mean today, and to explain how they should be properly understood in older literature. Very readable, though occasionally rather technical, I enjoyed it a great deal."
4,spending a fantastic life,"And what have you done with your life lately? Read what Tom Tepper did, and wonder how you've wasted your time, not homesteading in Oregon or breaking wild horses or teaching the infant Army Air Corps how to fly or analyzing trees for violin wood. Probably you even sleep most nights under a roof. However, easier to read about Tepper than do it yourself."
1,contains no tai chi,"There is a good reason all of the positive reviews are from beginners. None of the techniques are tai chi techniques, the form isn't any tai chi form, he misquotes his sources (his ""translation"" of tao Te Ching, for example, was made up from whole cloth) and vastly overstates his scholarship and expertise. The very least he could have done was take the minute it takes to google Tai Chi Forms and copy a couple of moves down before writing a book on the subject. This book is like an unfunny Tai Chi version of ""Real Ultimate Power: the Official Ninja Guide."" The people touting its benefits aren't describing anything you couldn't get from a jog around the block each morning."
4,A wonderful begining for a good day,"It is very good, but it goes a little too repetitious for me...and the exercises are a little too slow, it takes more than 15 min to develope them, but they are great."
1,Terrible! Get the other books in this series instead!,"I loved the other books in the series, but this one fell short. The cd was too slow---you would just be stabding there waiting for him to tell you what to do, and he'd be droning on about imagery and forests and such. Sooooo boring. The routine did not ""flow"" at all. Save your money and buy the morning cup of yoga instead."
3,decent odds and ends collection,"Being a recent initiate to the glory of the Oblivians, I picked up the first CD that I found, and this was it. It's almost worth the price alone for the first song, a blues-charged, furious rocker, but the rest is kind of hit or miss. Several B-sides, live tracks, covers, and more straight ahead blues and R&B stuff are included. Nevertheless, it still indicates why this band, in my opinion, beats the Blues Explosion at it's own game in the end. Sure, they never released anything as ambitious and unique as ""Orange"", but the body of their work, on the whole, is more durable and effective. They seemed to have alot more knowledge and understanding of blues and gospel music, while still subverting it to their own dastardly ends. Not the place to start, but yes, the best tracks here display their signature heartbroken fury, in fuzzed-out explosions of venom."
4,alot of good bands,"from lamb of god, to type 0 negative, to seether this cd has everything under the metal sun. alot of the songs are off of forthcoming albums. Most of the others are unreleased. The one big dissapointment was killswitch engage. I saw them at ozzfest and thought they were great. Their new singer, though, is nowhere near as good as their old one. This song is a horrible excuse for a song by these guys. It lacks so many things that they had before. I'll stop going off about this one song out of 20, but I think killswitch engage is the greatest band ever and their cd, alive or just breathing is the most incredible thing ever, but this new song isn't so good. But the cd is still worth buying"
1,Just like one long nu-metal song,"To many fans of the genre, this should be good. A lot nu-metal fans seem to have really enjoyed this album.Yet, I have never in my life heard one compilation from so many unique sources sound so alike. Two songs would pass before I realized the first was over, and frequently the only guage of a new song's beginning was the change in grunting technique. Even the Mike Patton/Sepultura collaboration sounded bland when placed alongside all the artists looking for that hip, fashionable nu-metal sound.The best thing I can say about the cd is that it makes a nice display piece for anyone who - like me - spent years anticipating this film."
3,Still better than its namesake movie...,"First off, let me say, this soundtrack was much better than its movie equivalent. Now, to the cd itself. Basically a Roadrunner Records mixtape. Now this isn't a bad thing, but a little more variety would have been nice. However I am surprised that they left out songs from Coal Chamber and Fear factory. These are great bands that ALWAYS make it onto Roadrunner compilations. Oh well. Highlights of this cd are the tracks by Ill Nino, Killswitch Engage, Mushroomhead, Murderdolls, Lamb of God (probably the heaviest song on here) and In Flames (one of my favorite bands, too bad they chose a nu-metal song instead of one of their flawless death metal songs. Clad in Shadows would have fit, I think) Overall, not a bad intro into the Roadrunner record label. Get it for the tracks mentioned."
4,Great music from a great movie,"You dont have to like the movie to like the soundtrack,I love the movie but the soundtrack is better.Hell you dont even have to see the movie to like the soundtrack.Very Very Good,Very Very happy with it."
4,Very good soundtrack,"- I have no interrest of horror-movie soundtracks, but due to the fact that i am both a Jason and a Freddy fan, i had to spend some money on this one. The ""Freddy vs Jason"" soundtrack unleash a robust collection of never-before-released tracks that many people (like myself) will find awesome. At first i was expecting a ""Scream"" (wich sucked) kind of soundtrack (since i havent heard of much of the artists on this soundtrack), but the FvsJ CD really went to my taste of music! El Nino's ""How Can I Live"" and Powerman 5000's ""Bombshell"" are the two best tracks on the CD. If you liked the Resident Evil soundtrack and the Heavy Metal F.A.K.K.2 soundtrack, then you'll love the Freddy vs Jason compilation. Oh... I also noted that there are two versions of this disc. The other one is stamped as ""clean"", i dunno whats so special about that disc, but i think they cencored some of the lyrics..."
5,If you like numetal buy this.,"This is the first soundtrack that I've seen that's featured just heavy metal songs on it. When I found that out I just bought it. I'm just getting in the numetal stuff and this gave me a taste of all the bands playing that kind of music. I really don't know what else to say about this, but if you have even a passing interest in the metal bands of today, check this out and you won't be disappointed."
5,Fantastic Mardi Gras-type music. A lot of fun!,"We saw this group at the Sacramento Jazz Jubilee in 1997 and bought the CD then. We listen to it often, because it is such feel good, have a party type music. Highly recommend it for just plain fun!"
5,Liszt in a mellow mood,Lovely lovely lovely music. Listen to this CD and watch the stars come out. Leslie Howard's playing is a revelation.
3,A turn for the worse,"This is the third, last, and worst Discount album. That's not to say it's a bad album -- it's tighter, slicker, and a bit more adventurous than their previous work.Their first, Ataxia's All Right, is simple, pop-punk done to it's most intelligent, exuberant, best. Their second, Half Fiction, showed them growing up, learning to play, and writing more complex but still catchy songs. In this last one, they begin to stretch a bit farther than their talents allow. In particular, this album seems to suffer from a more D.C./Fugazi influenced sound that just doesn't work. It's a tolerable album, but not the note that they should have gone out on. Start with Half Fiction, if you want to hear them at their best, and then come back to this one if you must."
5,A Blockbuster Recording!,"Elsewhere, I recommend Hickox's Chandos recording of Arnold's Symphonies 5&6, a wonderful disk: but this one is even more wonderful, and I recommend it without reservation not only to all Malcolm Arnold fans, but also to anyone who enjoys the sound of the symphony orchestra. In terms of both sound and performance quality, this CD is a blockbuster. Unfortunately, Conifer has apparently folded up shop, at least in terms of being distributed in the U.S."
2,Do not buy if you need to use audio function over the Internet!,"The major problem of this product is the audio quality. It's simply poor when used within the local network, and totally useless if you try to use it over the Internet (even with high speed cable connection). If I knew that audio quality is that bad, I would buy IP100 and save $50."
3,OK mini-series,"The three discs included here are entirely different from each other. I bought this DVD set for one reason. The main star is Andrew Garfield, who does a fantastic job acting in the first disc. I would give this first chapter in the series an A. It gets a bit boring in the next two discs. You never find out what happened to Andrew Garfield. Still, for Andrew Garfield fans I reccomend this just for the one disc."
2,"Good idea, but execution.","This is one trilogy not worth seeing. I love English movies and I am glad I bought it on sale at a local Best Buy. Even then I still regret buying it.1974: Starts interesting, but drags.1980: Same.1983: The best one of the series and wraps up the trilogy, but still not very good or interesting.Don't waste your time or money. Not worth seeing. Oddly I kept seeing parallels to Girl With A Dragon Tattoo. But that was done much better, and was interesting."
2,I Just Didn't Get it,"I'm sorry but I just don't agree with all these glowing reviews. I bought these 3 movies believing I was going to see some great true crime trilogy (that's what the synopsis on back of each video made me believe) and what I actually got was a very thin thread of a possible serial killer in action, spoken in a British accent that was so thick and unintelligible that I often found myself playing the same parts over and over, trying to get what they were saying. Halfway into the second disk I decided to stop trying and just muddle thru on my own. That was probably my smartest decision. This is not a serial killer trilogy. It is a set of three different movies with 3 different plots, 3 different stars, all done in a dark moody, rainy surrounding. All they had in common was the almost impossible to understand dialogue."
4,Dialects are fine,I am a Yank to be sure. But the dialects didn't bother me much if at all. Maxine Peake needs more work. She is a gem.
4,Watch with subtitles,As a veteran of years of British movies and TV I was looking forward to this well-reviewd series. It is set in Yokshire and the accents are some of the most inscrutible I'vve ever heard. By the end of the third movie I was scratching my head. But after a couple of months I watched them again with the subtitles and was able to appreciate their brilliance.
4,Great movie,"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. My only small quibble is that there were a few lines of dialogue I didn't quite catch because of the thick English accents. This movie may have needed subtitles, but I could be overreacting. If you like crime/mystery/corrupt police movies, I'd be shocked if you didn't like this movie.SPOILER ALERT!!!!Can anyone tell me - why did Craven and Dougie (the corrupt cops) give Eddie (the reporter) a handgun before they threw him out of the van towards the end of the movie? I'm glad he shot them all with it though!!"
5,Straight from the Consumers!,"This excellent videotape features Deaf actors and actresses -- students from the National Technical Institute for the Deaf -- signing and speaking for themselves and from their perspective as they deal with such subjects as: how to use a sign language interpreter; situations when an interpreter can be used; signing in the Deaf person's communication mode; the RID code of ethics (Professional Code of Conduct); and ADA requirements. While the videotape is dated (1993), its message is timely and it is an excellent resource for anyone interested in the subject."
5,Best investment ever made,"I purchased the FS-1 Speedometer over three months ago, and have nothing but praises for the product. Along with the Speedometer, I purchased the heart rate monitor and the data link. I've never had a running coach, but when I use this entire package it is the equivelent to haveing a coach. I am able to track my run second by second."
1,I would not recommend to anyone serious about running,"hiI bought and used this product intensively for 6 months and it is now dead in the water.first the start/stop/reset button started working uh .. randomly ... then the watch started to reset itself to 0 even with new batteries, then ice on the cake, the pod purely and simply stopped communicating with the watch... and since Fitsense does not have a return policy, I am stuck with a bulky $250 watch ....since I really need a distance monitor, I will now buy a Polar which is what I should have done at first. stick to the pro.I would rate this product -5 stars if I could. needless to say, I am fairly upset with it.ciao"
5,Still the best,"I have been using the FS-1 for over 5 years. I have the heart rate monitor and download the runs on to the Fitsense web site. Yes - you have to read the directions and it isn't the simplest running watch out in the market, but it is the best. The large watch face is great to keep track of pace, heart rate and distance during the run. And the web site is great for reviewing all the data, nicely charted out in a user friendly way. I think most runners could set up and calibrate the watch. Downsides - I go through a lot of batteries over the course of a year. I am also worried about the Fitsense staying in business and supporting the product.All in all - great speedometer for the serious runner."
4,Spine tingling,"I have read both the ""Child called it"" and ""Lost boy"" by Dave Pelzer this is seriously a spine tingling series it makes you laugh, it makes you cry for this poor little boy. this is a true story and a book that just begs you to just find a place for him in your heart. a great read for everyone who can take a sad and exciting book."
5,Amazing,These books are absolutely amazing. Read the entire series. What a brave child & man. My heart broke for him & was proud of him at the same time. A great writer and man!
5,The Lost Boy,EXCELLENT book. Just very sad. Made me very angry and very sad. Constantly crying wondering how mothers could be so hateful to their own children. I wish I could have saved Dave myself.
3,Gets Kids to READ,"I am not a big fan of David Pelzer. However as a high school librarian I have several copies of each of his books on the shelf for students. They are VERY popular and get kids reading. After they finish the 3 books I move them to something more worthwhile with a similar theme. Some of the books I have recommended with success include: Living at the Edge of the World, The Boy in the Basement, Room, Sickened, The Boy in the Striped Pajamas, etc. Anything that gets kids started reading is a move in the right direction. If students realize there is one book they really WANT to read, they are likely to trust that you can find another book they will WANT to read. I give this book 3 stars mainly because of the high interest level. It is inconsistent and poorly written, but it does get kids reading."
5,A gripping story of a child who beat the odds.,"I read the first book after David Pelzer came to my High School during my Junior year. I couldn't believe that someone could actually survive such hellish conditions. His story is very sad, but it is one that needs to be told, so that people become aware that this kind of thing goes on. After listening to his story, I decided to become a youth counselor, to help kids who have to go through something like that. His survival is inspirational."
4,A Child Called It,"From the beginning of A Child Called ""It"", by Dave Pelzer, I knew what my reaction to this book was. Throughout the entire book my opinion never changed, it remained an excellent book. There was always something happening that held your interest. This book is motivating, inspirational, and interesting all at the same time. Pelzer pulls your emotions in every direction as he talks about the abuse he was put through as a child. Not only is this book informative on the topic of child abuse, but it is also a tear-jerker."
3,A foster child raises above his surroundings.......,"I read David's first book ""A Child called IT"" and found this installment of his saga to be much more inspiring. All david wanted was to be loved and he could not find that with his mother. He did find it in the homes of a couple of people who took him in. Even tho he still got into trouble, you could see that all he needed was true love to turn him around. He became a foster child but it did not dim his soul. Now I have to read the next book in the series."
5,The Lost Boy : A Foster Childs Search for the Love of a Fami,"This book is an excellent follow up to ""A Child CAlled It"". Once I started reading I couldn't put it down. My heart just ached for this little boy and all the struggles in his life. There is no way I can relate to his story, but it did open my eyes to realities that happen in this world."
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY!!,"It's a good read, but I really hate to think I [had to purchase] not one, not TWO, but THREE of this guy's books to find out what happens ... This guy is a MOTIVATIONAL SPEAKER! This is how he makes a living! The books are fairly good, but full of inconsistencies. The title book, A Child Called It..... is a good example. Only once does his mother call him, ""IT""....but if you buy his last book in the series the phrase is peppered throughout... Another example I found was in the profound memories this 4-year-old child has. Nobody thinks that way as a kid.....who remembers details so vividly at the age of 4!?!... I know this guy suffered some form of abuse, it is recorded in the county records, but as the episodes morph into more bizzare forms of punishment as you buy each installment, I think there is a bit of exaggeration going on here. One point in the last book he writes that his own wife doesn't believe him. Well, no wonder. The story just keeps e x p a n d i n g..."
1,As unsatisfying as the 'IT' book,"I am so disappointed with this book I could scream. The tantalising teasers left by the author in his first book have not been addressed in this, the sequel to It...let's get real here - the book's lack of objectivity contributes to this less than insightful book. I'm disappointed that Dave, once again, didn't mention his brothers and mother, where are they and what has happened to them. Why did his mother seem hell bent on having him institutionalised. Why Why Why. I need answers. And will I find them in Book 3?A disappointing read."
5,Excellence continued,"The second story of survival. A must read for those who read the first story, A child called it."
3,windsor jr./ sr.high school,"it is sad for it is a real story it is about a boy how is abused and then taken from his home this boy is the brave auther of the book called a child called""it"" this mans is the youngest of three children in his family he is dave pelzer"
3,Kid for Sale,"This book is basically about a boy named David, from A Child Called It, that escapes from his house and his abusive mother. He ends up going to a foster home and has to move from home to home all the time. He goes through different struggles at each home, and is faced with many decisions. I enjoyed reading this book.I liked the first book better, but I did like that David got out of his abusive house.I didn't like that David's dad doesn't really care for David as much anymore. I also did like that David's brother talked to him while David was living at a foster home.I would recommend this book to someone who read the first book, or to someone who enjoys reading books about people's problems and how they deal with them. Someone who enjoys the Drama kind of books will like this. This is also a suspenseful book if you like those kinds of books."
5,Another great book from Dave,I have purchased all three of his books and as a mother of 3 I found myself not understanding the horrible things done to this young man...I must say that it has helped me deal with my past of childhood abuse also...God Bless Dave!
3,Still dont know how to feel.,I enjoy reading Davids books but I don't know how to feel about them now that i know they are EMBELLISHED ):.
2,Not as good as his first.,I read his first book which I liked but thought this one was boring. I almost couldn't finish it but stuck it out. I have no desire to read his third book.
3,The Lost Boy,Everything was basically fine with the book but some of the pages in the front were folded on the corners and the outside looks a little weathered.
4,A good book to read about people who get hurt.,"This book is good if you like to hear about people getting abused. This book is about a little boy whose mother is abusing him and then he gets put into foster care. He gets moved around and around because people did not know he was coming. So they had to keep moving him and moving him around.He just wants to be put in a famliy that loves him and will care for him. I give this book about 4 stars because it's a good book that shows how not all people have a good life, just like everyone thinks.This good because it makes you think hard about people who did get hurt."
1,More of the same!,"After determining that the first book was really a work of FICTION, I started to read this book because it claimed that questions would be answered.That turned out to be a sales gimmick!There were no answers, no explanations, no closure... merely the further embellishments of the author through the foster care system.If I want fiction, I at least want fiction that is honest enough to be in the fiction section of the bookstore!"
2,Not Ringing True,"Reading Dave Pelzer's story of his troubled youth as contained in ""The Lost Boy,"" I constantly found myself troubled by the author's point of view. It is essentially the point of view of an adult attempting to mimic the point of view of a teenager. One gets the impression that the author laid down in print stories he had refined through repeated telling to audiences on the lecture circuit. I also found troubling the detailed recollection of conversations many years after the fact. Again, the recollections (to the extent not wholly manufactured) are heavily tinged with the attitude of an adult, not that of an adolescent."
5,Heart breaking,This book was such a heart breaking story that I wanted to cry but yet couldn't put the book down I needed to know what was going to happen to David. I was so suprised that a human being could be so mean. I thought this was one of the best true story books that I have read. I'm now reading the second book and it's just as heart breaking yet interesting.
5,Another excellent book.,"Although not quite as intense as the first book, A Child Called It, still an excellent book. Especially if you've read the first in the series."
5,What a touching book!,"Anybody that reads this review should absolutely think about reading the book. Start with ""The Child Called It"" and if you do not enjoy this book, which you should, then you have a decision to not start the second book. David Pelzer is an awesome author and has a lot of courage to write about his childhood. I give him an a+ for writing these wonderful books. If you do take my advice and pick up one of his books, ENJOY!!"
3,Revealing,I did not enjoy this book because of the subject matter. Child abuse is tough reading. The author tells a compelling story based on his life experiences. This book will change my prejudices about foster children and parents.
1,Fake Story per NY Times,"The NY Times covered this author and his books more than 10 years ago in 2001. None of Dave Pelzer's claims can be substantiated. This guy is a charlatan preying on people's minds and compassion. I read the books, was horrified, and then saw this article, which set me straight. This guy has made his entire career telling this false story for 15 years. His brothers say it isn't true and that he was a spoiled brat with visions of grandeur growing up. The genesis of his story of his mother ""stabbing"" him was actually her cutting food in the kitchen, and him moving fast around her and getting slightly poked, but not cut, by the knife. It is an outrage that someone like this has taken advantage of people's emotions for so long. His books are pretty low price, even here on Amazon. One is 7 cents? That doesn't happen to valid books."
4,50/50,"Received the book about 10 days after ordering, The book had library stickers on it. But it was $.1 (one penny) Other then the sticker, Very satisfied with the product! Very happy with the price :)"
4,A good and quick read,After reading a Child Called It I had to read The Lost Boy to find out what happened to Dave Pelzer. It was hard to believe child abuse on this level could happen! I wanted to see if his mother was ever brought to justice for what she did to him. I didn't find out in this book but it was worth reading to find out about our foster care system. I had to keep in mind that that this took place in the 70's and 80's as to not be more upset with a broken system as it was just the times and the realities of child abuse becoming public were just coming into play. I pray that today system is much better. This is an honest book written by a man who desires greatly to never allow another child to go through what he went through.
5,One boy's struggle for survival,"The author's success for surviving was believing on a dream of finding a family to love and take care of him. He held on to that dream which kept him alive all of those years he was kept captive in his abusive home. When he was finally removed from the home he knew everything was going to be all right because he had already lived the hardest part of his life, trying to survive. David Pelzer, as a child, suffered all types of abuse physically, verbally, emotionally, and perhaps sexually. His joy was hindered as a result of the emotional pain and suffering from feelings of rejection not only from his mother but from his siblings and most importantly is father. He felt hopeless and unloved by his family. The author's courage to become a public speaker with his life story helped him and others to be freed from childhood torments. He encouraged other to let go of the past but never to run from it. As a result domestic violence in his life ended with him."
2,This book still can not answer many questions,"After reading the first book, The Boy Called 'It', I have many questions, such as why the mother changed so much, why the mother singled the author out, etc.. I thought these questions would be answered in the second book, as what the first book suggested. However, other than hard selling his unfortunate past, and kept repeating emphasizing how bad the Mother was, the author failed to use a high level, objective view to tell the story.I felt there're something hiding behind story while reading between the lines of the book."
5,Love reading his words,I have been reading and rereading his written words since the 7th grade. Very descriptive and extremly heartfelt.
3,Compelling Story,"I aplaud the author for his great ability to overcome his abuse. His resiliency is puzzle to so many. We like to know all we can about it so somehow we can figure out why some people have that miraculous formula to survive and some don't. He has it. It was a good story because of his balitlity to overcome but I did not think the book was well written. It could have been told better. The characters lacked, not enough detail to envision, feel taste... I guess I would have liked more descriptiveness of his enviroment and the peolpe in the story. Perhaps this is all his momory would allow."
5,From childhood victim to adult victor.,"David Pelzer, against all the odds, grew into a respected, loving and compassionate man. This book will inspire anyone who thinks they have a ""tough life"" to try harder. He is living proof that the human spirit can overcome most anything. Wonderful and inspiring!"
4,This book was really good!,The first book was better than this because it was more emotional but this book is really incredible. It talks about what happened after Dave got away from his abusive home. It is really good and I recommend it for everybody.
5,The Lost Boy,"The book I read was for an enlish project in 9th grade. It was a really good book. It is sad at some parts but it is good. I like storys like that that get you thinking what is going to happen next. The aurther does a good job decribing the book. The book gets you thinking what is going to come up next, is his mom going to get him back and start to abuse him again or, is he going to be a happy child. Then the book decribes how a mother can treat and abuse her child like that and if a mom does that it teaches parents and kids that they can get tooken away from the mother. In the story it tells us how the kid suffered and dident get food only left overs and how bad his mom abused him. I think that every person should read this book so parents can see what will happen and so children can see what would happen if there parents did that to them and that it is a good book."
5,A really interesting book,i think the book was so good.i could really relate to it as i am also in foster care.dave has shown alot of corage in his life and this book deserves a prize.i read his last book and it made me cry.everyone should read this book. i also want to big up everyone at tulse hill school in BRIXTON! from keisha chanel brown.age 12
5,My Hat Goes Off To Dave Pelzer,All of Dave Pelzer's books are absolutely by far the best books I have ever read. I couldn't put them down!!!
5,"FAST read, excellent story","This was an amazing story, told from a perspective only someone who lived through could say so well. An awesome awesome story."
5,good book,My grandson wanted this book for a book report and we both read it. It was so sad but informative and he got an A on his report which made it better.
5,Heartwrenching,This book was so sad and I can not believe how a mother can single out one child and abuse them. Once a child is abused it is so hard for that child to find trust again.
5,A book everyone should read,"""The Lost Boy"" is a sequal to ""A Child Called It"". Both books are page turners and sadly true. I would recommend this book to students in highschool, college and to all parents. Both books are very emotional and spell-binding. I could not put either book down until I was finished reading."
4,Touching true story of a foster child's struggles..,"This is an incredible autobiographical novel about a foster child's life in search of a family.This book is the second in Dave Pelzer's trilogy about his life and the power of the human spirit to triumph over adversity.The Lost Boy is written using the language of a young boy/teenager depending on the time period that is being discussed. The story is sad, but hopeful as Dave grows from a 12yr old boy into an 18 year old adult. As the story unfolds he goes through several foster homes in the search for a place to call home and a family he can finally grow attached to. It's an inspiring read and I would recommend it for anyone of any age."
5,Life changing story!!,"There are no words to describe the pain I felt as I read the words describing the torture Dave endured at the hands of his mother and brothers. There are no words to describe the anger I felt at his father's betrayal. I have a hard time dealing with ignorance and prejudice, both of which I confronted as I read the story of Dave's life in foster care.I have seen Dave on television, I am amazed at how kind, gentle and loving he is. He is an inspiration to all of us that we can make choices for a better life.I eagerly await the final book of the trilogy, the closure is needed."
4,can't believe this could happen,This book is so scary in the aspect that you think this stuff doesn't really happen but it does. It definately helped me to understand from the abusers point of view. You just can't hate your parents. There always seems to be that hope it could be different. Good book.
3,The Lost Boy,The Lost Boy was interesting but did not keep my attention as A Boy Called It. There was a lot of content that did not need to be there. My heart goes out to him. He is an inspiration to everyone. What he went thru should not have been allowed to happen. His Mother should have been sent to prison and the other children taken from her. His life makes you count your blessings and really think about things we complain about. He is an inspiration and he should be very proud of himself. But his MOTHER !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,Great Book,This is a really good touching book! I dont think i have ever read a book that made me wanna cry more than 3 times. hahas
5,You just wanted to hug him and keep him safe.,"An excellent sequel to A Child Called It. Throughout the whole book, you just wanted to take care of him - tell him it was going to be okay. Dave's courage is immesurable; I'm eagerly looking forward to the finale of the trilogy."
2,Good Lord! Choke!,"I sympathize with Pelzer for enduring such horrific childhood abuse. However, enduring child abuse doesn't automatically make one a thoughtful or even a competent writer. The Lost Boy too often seems like a baggy E.C. Comics knockoff, with the young Pelzer fleeing in terror from his one-dimensional, monstrous mother. Nobody must have proofread this book; in its dopiest scene, set in the 1970s, the young Dave anachronistically pumps his fist in triumph and says ""Yes!"""
2,The Lost Boy Review,"The book The Lost Boy by David Pelzer, was a poorly written book. David failed to express his feelings as a foster child in this book, therefore there is no connection between the character and the reader. Knowing the feelings emerging from inside the character is an important key to get into the book. Without them, it can cause the book to drag on and seem almost never ending. I wouldn't recomend to read this book even if the first book had been read and enjoyed."
4,My review of 'The Lost Boy',"'The Lost Boy' is an inspirational story about one boys struggle to find a family. After being abused throughout most of his childhood, David Pelzer, is finally rescued from the place he once called 'home' and is forced to go through the Foster Care system. After reading the first two books in this trilogy of Dave Pelzer's life, i found both of them to be equally captivating and heart warming. I would reccomend this book to anyone who is mature enough to handle it and can understand the intensity of what Dave had to go through during his adolescent years."
4,IT'S GGGGREAT!,"Well this is the second of the trilogy and it is as wonderful as the first. Didn't really want to finish it because I didn't want to know the end. However, once I did finish, I loved it. Hopefully the third is just as good."
5,Makes really smooth mashed potatoes,"I cannot believe I went as long as I did without one of these things! This ricer makes the most fluffy, lump-free potatoes I have ever tasted. It is easy to use and clean. The only down side is that you can only put a small amount of potatoes in the unit, at a time. So if you have a lot of potatoes to mash, it can be a bit time consuming. For years, I've used an electric hand mixer to mash my potatoes and they sometimes came out gummy. Not with this unit. Nice and Fluffy!The easiest way to keep this clean is to wash it, immediately after using it. Don't let the potatoes dry in the holes. If you wash it and dry it right away, the unit will stay as good as new."
4,good little tool,works great for more than just potato's. We use it for deviled eggs and other things we like to mash up good. Been a great product when we use it.
2,Potato Ricer,Nice construction but the press didn`t quite match up to the basket which causes it to squirt over the top.
4,Contemporary Cuban informed by history,Sexto Ache makes Cuban forms smoke in a contemporary way. Nobody is over 70 on this CD
4,Subtle and poignant,"""Anything Goes"" drifts along, raveling out the thread of its story in a leisurely style that's at once engaging and attractive. Taking place over a year and in many locales, ""Anything Goes"" introduces us to Jesse, a disaffected and somewhat bitter young man traveling through his life as a member of a band called...you guessed it...Anything Goes. As a band name, the title [is bad].... But as a theme for the novel it works quite well.Jesse, abandoned as a child by his mother and physically abused by his father, has become a man who doesn't expect good things from the world. As he matures throughout the pages of this book, he discovers himself in ways that are both subtle and poignant. This is a quiet story that stays with you long after you've read it...and I recommend giving it a read!"
4,good portrait of abuse,"I found this one very readable--the prose flowed right along. The handling here and there of racial issues was interesting, though I was disappointed to see another kind, decent, one-dimensional ""magical black friend"" helping out a white character at the center, such a typical American literary and cinematic device. But the protagonist isn't fully white, which is an interesting twist, but not one that really ends up going anywhere. Still, those quibbles aside, the movement of Jesse away from his father's abuse toward autonomy, and apparently toward forgiveness of his father, was very effective and honest. Nearly everything in this novel felt very real, and it taught me some things about making music too."
3,very conservative,"I think that every archeology undergrad should find this of benefit. But don't expect Eric Von Danican. It will be slow going for most of you. But I do appreciate what the author is saying, and it's very, very valid. I even got some cartoon ideas out of it!"
2,A disappointing look at a fascinating subject,"Admittedly, I start many books in the middle, and so it was with Forbidden Archeology. My disappointment began when I read the chapter on ""ape men"" and the possible survival of bigfoot-like hominids well into the modern era. While I'm not completely closed to the idea, the section smacked of pseudo-science: little better than the Bigfoot books of the 1970s and filled with dubious eye witness accounts and third-hand facts. Given all the silliness and exploitation within crypto-zoology over the years, we need a bit more than what the authors provide to take this seriously.And so it is for much of this book. Cremo and Thompson have collected a great deal of material, some if contradictory, much of is dubious, and crafted a thesis which is difficult to trust. That's a shame, because there is more than enough fascinating, legitimate material on anomalous discoveries to easily fill a book this size."
1,actually dissapointed,I got my copy the other day. I had high expectations - but..The book hardly contains any images...A book of this kind should ( by my opinion ) show a lot of good quality photographic evidence of its claims. the images are mainly some poor quality photo or drawings of stone tools ( nothing I have'nt seen before)
1,I've seen no-star ratings before but don't know how to do it,"Be thankful for the process of social evolution, for it will eventually weed out the likes of Cremo from our society. I predict that within 100 years it will be impossible to get a book such as Forbidden Archeology published. I mean, would anyone publish a book attempting to still prove that Galileo was wrong?"
2,you must be joking,"Cremo's work is nonsensical. The scholarship is questionable. The arguments typically proceed from a misunderstanding of the evidence or a faulty analysis of the processes at work. ""Perhaps"" is not a convincing argument. I've seen this type of nonsense many a time. Indeed, traditional answers leave various lacunae, but Cremo's sensationalist jazz neither advances his agenda nor satisfactorily calls into question the mountains of solid work accumulated over centuries. Significantly, Cremo's material adheres to no structure, espouses no philosophy, gels in no wise, but merely offers anecdote atop anecdote to persuade the reader to ask, ""Gee, what if; well, I suppose that's conceivable."" Please, just take a pass on this abject nonsense."
2,Mostly nonsense premise,"A lot has been learned of genetics in the last 5 to 10 years.We know for a scientific fact the human race is way under 10 millon years old. Though it's multiple times older than the ridiculous YEC proposal of just 10,000 years tops. This book is under the foolish impresion, I thought, that humankind is around 55 million years old. Or something like that. Nonsense!"
1,MALODOROUS,"Being greatly interested in subjects relating to the age of humankind and archaeological finds relating to same, I ordered this large tome, but to my surprise, upon opening the book, a horrible stench struck my olfactory senses--repulsive,strong, and malodorous--so I quickly closed it.Obviously the publisher is using something in the materials that resulted in such a nasty smell. Dr. Cremo should immediatlely seek another publisher or have the current one change its binding glue or whatever is creating the odor. Amazon was kind enough to issue a refund, and on my part, I then ordered the shorter version of the same book that is put out by a different publisher. That one is fine, and I will report on it after I read it."
5,An Important Book,"This book is a difficult read but the ideas discussed are important and relevant. If you have an interest in archeology, creationism, or the history of human development, you need to read this book."
2,Missing facts,"The book doen't mention Fred Spoor, a famous scientist whose work in the early 90's showed that the ear canals of all modern humans are rather different than the ear canals of the extinct Neanderthals. Since the ear canal actually controls the ability to walk upright (to a large degree) this shows that Neanderthals most likely walked upright differently too but very differently than us modern people. The ear canals of the also extinct homo erectus show that like us it too was an upright walker and certainly not a giant gibbon (an animal the authors of this book seem to want us to believe erectus was). Since the revised version of this book was made in 1996 (or the most likely earliest at least 1995) I do not know why they didn't make a mention of Spoor and the ear canal studies he proved."
4,A Text Book of Forgotten Imformation for Archeologists,"What I enjoyed most about this book was content, lots and lots of superbly researched and argued content,complete with an exstensive bibliography. Any open-minded scientific person would have to acknowledge this work if they read it.Emotion is human nature,facts stand on their own.Anomalies and contradictions are percieved in all areas of science and everyday life. I have a question for Mr.Darwin; Sir,why did our brains get so large and complex,so long ago when mankind at the apex of evolution uses so little of it now?"
1,Be Careful,"Cremo and Thompson are known for their slanted views of archeology formed from Hindu theology. What they claim as fact, others have shown as false. Certainly, this is not the ""hidden history of the human race."" I suggest you check the web for resources. (Geologist, writer, and former professor)"
1,Major Joke,"This is not a scientific inquiry. It is more of a hoax, a money making project by the authors. Every single ""ancient artifact""- ALL OF THEM- were NOT dated. Instead the authors claim that since the artifacts were found in certain layers of rock, then the artifacts must be that old. This is the same as sticking a TV in a 2 billion year old rock sediment, then when someone finds it, they claim the TV must be 2 billion years old. This is how EVERY SINGLE OBJECT IS ""DATED"".It is a sad fact that some people believe such nonsense. The authors claim that they found human artifacts in a rock layer 2.8 billion years old, therefore modern man must go back that far. Yet they didnt date the object itself, only the rocks around it. Dont get sucked into this mess, it is a hoax."
1,Interesting Premise: Lack of Hard Evidence,"Like UFO's, ESP, or Psychic Network commercials, the authors' idea is certainly far more interesting than current scientific theories. The ""evidence"" supporting their arguments having either disappeared or been discounted by the dominant paradigm, the authors rely on what amounts to little more than hearsay. Of course it's all lies, but they're interesting lies. And isn't that more important than the truth?"
1,Creationism from left field,"This is a large book that begins with the authors exhortations to his ""Spiritual Master"" the ""Divine Grace Swami"" blah blah blah. Clearly someone who is a spiritual slave cannot be an independent thinker and in this Cremo does not dissapoint. This book reminds me of two things: First, the tactic used by Conservative Christian talk show hosts who talk over their guests incessantly to cover the trail left by their weak arguements and shallow grasp of facts; Secondly, it reminds me of the book Holy Blood, Holy Grail which covers such a variety of fields that it is impossible to fact check by the layman and therefore extremely popular with those of us missing the seven PhD's necessary to even begin to question the book.The tactic of flooding the unprepared defense with paperwork is a time honored, and universally despised practice of lawyers with lots of time and money and little regard for the truth. It's one that the authors here use to their advantage with equal facility."
2,Very informaitve but way too much,I started reading this book and decided it is not a cover to cover read.This book is full of endless examples of archeaology finds and controversies about how long the current version of man has been on this earth. Lots of examples of suppressed finds of very old remains that are believed to be way older than the 100000 years man has suppposedly been around. But the academic community is not ready to re-write the evolution of man as it stands today.You can find enough of this in Cremo's other book The Devolution of Man. Though I have not read far into this book yet either.
1,evolution at its worst,The argument for human evolution at its worst. Though I am far from being a believer in evolution I still gave this is due attention. Darwin would be embarrassed as would any other half brained follower of the greatest hoax on the planet.
5,Do we have all the info on human origins ?,I always thought that there is more to homo sapiens than 10.000 or 100.000 years so i was looking for some reading about it when I bumped into this book that revues and digs into a lot of info about the subject. More info than I expected. I am through the 2nd chapter but I already know I will read it with pleasure several times.
1,"Boring, Boring, Boring",One of the most boring books I have ever read about a fascinating subject. The television show that prompted me to buy this book was much better.
1,Silly and foolish nonsensical speculation,"Forbidden Archaeology is a perfect example of fantastic archaeology. It is so fantastic and forbidden because it is largely a comic book fantasy of the authors imaginations, a work of science fiction that no legitimate archaeologist would ever take seriously. Since neither author have credentials in archaeology, one has to wonder how they have been able to uncover this so called Hidden History, while all professional archaeologists are so deluded. Forbidden Archaeology falls under mythology, science fiction, or new age mysticism, but definitely NOT serious archaeology."
1,Poor understanding of science,"A book that proclaims man has existed in anatomically modern form for hundreds of millions of years? could this be a creationist tract? Unfortunately it is. The authors misunderstand the concept of a theory, bring religion into science (science ends up being based on a particular religious viewpoint, thus rendering it invalid), misrepresent scientists' theories and statements, and ignores work which contradict their religious ideas.The pieces on Laetoli, Kanapoi and the Hans Reck skeleton are particular disgraceful examples - all of which will be dealt with in a forthcoming book by myself.The ""evidence"" presented by Cremo hasn't a leg to stand on."
3,Very technical,As a lay person I found Forbidden Archeology interesting but too technical. Relating to the average person is needed in this very profound subject.
3,A Reference for Future Archaeologists,"I spent several years in Central Asia, travelling the Old Silk Road in search of lost artifacts and forgotten historical clues. I wish I had this book with me before I left. But now that I have read it,I am delighted and pleased. You need not agree with all his conclusions, but you will always wonder ""what if..."" after reading this book. I do recommend it."
4,"I like it, but...","I'm a big fan of Delius, more so his orchestral works than chamber or concertos. The Violin Sonatas can be difficult to listen to due to the odd grasp that Delius had on harmony - here it doesn't make such smooth transitions as it does in the shifting sounds of an orchestra. But there is no doubt the music is beautifully played, as all other reviewers have noted (the Andante from posth. sonata is fascinating) but be warned that this music is not for everyone, and may take some time to get used to; I always find myself wanting to like all of the disc, but I can't, and maybe won't for a long time. Still, worth a spin every now and then. :)"
5,An AWAIR Pick!!!,"Thought by many Syrians to be the most influential novel of its time, this first novel of Muhammad Kamil al-Khatib is a riveting examination of Syrian political and social life during the 1980's. With a multi-voiced narration carried, like a river, from one voice to another, al-Khatib paints concise, vivid portraits of a disparate group of people in Damascus, ranging from an older officer in the Syrian army, to a university student coming to terms with her sexuality in a traditional context, to a British Orientalist on sabbatical, to a disillusioned activist who must reconcile his ideals with the realities of war and city life. Though the particularities of the explored lives may be quintessentially Syrian, the struggle between the generations, between victor and vanquished is international in scope.Teachers/Librarians: wonderful addition to curricula for 9th grade to adult - Social Studies/Language arts"
5,A must for the Las Vegas architecture junkie...,"I've read other Alan Hess books- Googie come to mind. I really enjoyed Hess's style for this book. Alan Hess writes an occasional column for the San Jose Mercury News concerning architecture. He did not leave me disappointed with this book. It was evident that Alan Hess enjoyed this place as much as I did on my last visit to Sin City!This book came out in 1993. If you're looking for information on the newer hotels that have sprung up, the ones that came and left during then and now, you won't find it here. You will find details about the ones that were imploded during the 90's, which was a nice resource for those of us that were curious about the Sands, Dunes, Hacienda and the Aladdin. It's also an indication of just how much the strip has evolved from the timeline of the publishing of this book and what is the strip looks today, year 2001. An excellent study of the architecture changes of Vegas and its reflections on the rest of the U.S."
2,what sounded sweet in 1992,"Back in the VERY early 90's, I had this (the cassette tape version) and thought it was amazing. Until I bought the cd recently, I didn't realize how dated ""Rave 'til Dawn"" would sound to me. It was almost painful to listen to, and I remain a huge fan of techno/electronic music! I would only recommend this for laughs or a 90's nostalgia night."
3,Nice Quality,"This looks good. It acts as a privacy protector for sure in the day light. But the problem is, it wont control the sunlight , infact, it is giving a lot of heat inside. One example is , during the snow time only when it is sunny, I have the film to one glass and the other glass doesnt. The one with the film becomes hot whereas the other glass is very cold..."
2,could have problem,"Liked the product and how it cut the sunlight but two windows cracked on their own after installation. Im in a high rise and chose to remove the remaining film, just in case it was the cause of cracks. I image cause was the heat reflecting and/or heat built up."
1,a pain to put up,"this is not a very quality product, it's difficult to cut, a bear to get wrinkles out of, and doesn't seem to be adhering to the window itself very well and even after all of that,it does a sub-standard job of blocking out the sunlight, a poor choice, if they were giving them away, I'd say no thanks! an update, I put this on 3 window sections last night, I just walked in the door this afternoon and they're all peeled off......this is just a terrible product, a waste of time and money!"
3,Tints but doesn't enhance privacy,"I purchased this to increase the privacy of a bathroom window. I was a bit hesitant to purchase because of the comments suggesting that it was very difficult to apply. The folks that had application issues, I'm not too certain what made the task so difficult for them - I was able to apply the film in under 5 minutes. No bubbles.That said, this film did nothing to enhance the privacy and I find that description of this product to be deceptive. The film is a dark tint and does not obscure the view in the least.If you want only to tint your windows for aesthetics, this film will work well. If you want a tint to increase privacy then select a different product.I have since purchased:Black Out Privacy Window Film - 24"" wide x 1yd: Sold in one continuous roll, by the yard.This black out privacy film by Remlor is a 100% block."
5,Easy,As long as you cut to size with it's paper still on it cuts with any old scissors. Clean and dry the glass and will not have any problems making it stick to the glass. It uses static to cling so no worry's.
2,black out film that doesn't,"I bought this film hoping to completely block daylight from a room (our garage). What it does is very significantly reduce the light allowed through but it doesn't black out the room. This product should be renamed something like ""room darkening film"" or in some way say that it cuts daylight by 80% or whatever. It will not 100% block sunlight. Just so you know."
4,The real reason to buy this CD,"The movie itself was a balance of extremes: strong but understated acting versus strong and overstated violence.The soundtrack is entirely enjoyable as expected from oneof our finest composers. BUT, the reason you should own thisCD is Julianna Raye's performance. It's only one song, but isabsolutely worth the price of admission. I'm guessing thathearing her voice will lead most people to search for her soloCDs. I did and have become a big fan. Listen to her!"
5,Another good low key score by Michael Kamen,Ever since his brilliant score to THE IRON GIANT Michael Kamen has shifted his style from slam-bang action scores to the more gentle and calming nature of the relationship of man to his environment and to what purpose do we exist in that environment. I found this score to be very subtle yet powerful in its almost non-present background to the images on the screen. This is another delight to have on Compact Disc.
4,Beautiful music,"Listen, this was not the greatest movie ever. But the terrific music greatly added to the wonderful photography and story. And for those who saw the movie and did not wait for the credits then shame on you. For you missed hearing one of the great movie themes sung by a wonderful singer, Julianna Raye. She wrote the words and sang like an angel. Buy this album for this alone. Remarkable."
2,John Williams?,"You really need to pay more attention to film scores if you are going to give advice. John Williams had no part in scoring ""Dances with Wolfs""; John Barry was the composer. I don't have a review. I just thought I'd let you know, since you think we should listen to someone that doesn't know John Barry from John Williams. Look if you want real advice, go to www.Filmscoremonthly.com. Those people know what they're talking about, just ask them whether or not something is worth buying."
5,One of the most beautiful songs ever!!,"""Music of my heart"" is such a beautiful songs I love how 'N Sync and Gloria Estefan teamed up to make such a great song. A must have!!!"
3,"Good record, though the Diane Warren sap is too obvious","This was a good song when I first heard it. But it's become kind of sappier a good five years later. The combination of *NSYNC and Gloria Estefan was a wise move, to bridge two generations of artists into one song. JC Chasez actually sounds better than Justin Timberlake on the leads of that song and blends with Gloria quite well. But the sappiness of Diane Warren's lyrics, especially the gushiness of the chorus, is all too much like 40 other songs she's written for other artists. And the music is as slick as floor wax in the first 2 minutes before the orchestra start to come in. This will be well remembered for a long time to come with this ballad, which is nice."
5,THIS IS SUCH A BEAUTIFUL SONG!!!!!!!,THE FIRST TIME I HEARD THIS SONG WAS ON THE RADIO. I LOVE IT SO MUCH. I AM A HUGE 'N SYNC FAN. I HAVE ALL THEIR CD's. I HAD TO GET THIS. THE SONG IS SO BEAUTIFUL. ONCE AGIAN THEY HAS COME OUT WITH A HIT SONG. EVERYONE SHOULD GET THIS.
1,Nothing But Problems,I've had nothing but problems with this TV. It does not work- I've had it for service but they can't find the problem. Nightmare! Waste of $315!!
2,"99% Novel, 1% TOC","Necessary But Not Sufficient can be boiled down to three points:1. Technology is worthless if it doesn't bring bottom-line value.2. ""Drum-buffer-rope"" and ""Buffer Management"" are good3. ""Pull"" inventory management is goodAs an rabid reader and huge fan of The Goal, I was dissapointed with the delivery of this book. The fictional plot was boring and the characters were met with absolute apathy. While the above three points are repeated ad nauseum, no real background or detail is revealed on their delivery or use. Instead, Necessary But Not Sufficient is written as lengthy pieces of plot followed by short, almost textbook definitions of these business concepts.If you're looking for a more interesting and in-depth read, stick with The Goal. Otherwise, shop around for a more engaging and insightful book."
2,Worst of the TOC Novels,"This book has very little new material from previous TOC books. It doesn't lead the reader as well as The Goal or It's Not Luck. In short it is a ""Rah-Rah"" book telling the reader how great TOC is without giving much detail and in the context of a novel that doesn't create a great amount of character sympathy. I really don't understand how a man as brilliant as Goldratt could have written this. Get The Goal, It's Not Luck, and the appropriate textbook(s) to implement TOC in your business."
1,The plot is the constraint!,"Don't get me wrong--I'm a big TOC fan. I loved The Goal, Critical Chain, and It's Not Luck. I even bought a textbook on TOC. I was so excited for this book and so disappointed. I'm surprised anybody has given this book more than two starts. The plot is 100% non-captivating and I learned NOTHING new about TOC.Please Mr. Goldratt--Give us something good next time."
1,Not Sufficient,If you don't know what Drum-Buffer-Rope is before you read this book you still won't afterword. I can't believe how many times this is mentioned without an explanation. And it is not much better for Buffer-Management. There is no real substance here.
2,"Not Sufficient, Need More Luck","I agree with some of the other reviews, Goal and Its Not Luck were very helpful, and so I expected this book to give more practical examples for service industries and for more abstract and unpredictable manufacturing processes like software development. The sample company covered by the book was already growing by biblical proportions and used TOC to keep growing. I pictured this company buying up Microsoft and HP on a whim one day. How about a small to medium sized company with tough real life problems?"
4,TOC Applied to the High Tech Industry,"This is the story of a high-tech company that sells ERP systems and how it decided to move from selling a bunch of features to selling bottom-line value and in the process has increased it's business considerably. In parallel, their main product is also moving in lock step from a pure ERP to a TOC based management system. As with all of Goldratt's business novels, the main characters have their ""ah ha"" moment.I could relate to it because I'm a techie too and I'm used to being sold ""features"" and ""benchmarks"" as opposed to value. As an end user the bottom-line is often emotion, status or recognition, which in the high-tech world is often not well addressed (Apple being a notable exception by selling ""features"" and ""bottom-line"" together). It's an easy read and actually quite fun."
5,"upbeat bouncy album,easy to listen to",great tunes by a first class group jill saward and billy sharp are a terrific team.
3,Good but stay away,"how many times can you hear ""Calling your name?"" do yourself a favor - don't do what i did and collect the platipus volumes - just get the best of platipus - mixed by anthony pappa - you'll save a ton of money, avoid incredible track overlap and get a double mix CD - the only reason to get this or any other platipus volume is to have the individual tracks of particular remixes (i swear the same songs make up 75% of volumes 3-5)"
4,this is where they steal the ideas for great movies,"It's a fun little romp that just keeps you wanting to read another page,with characters so vivdly described you can see them standing at the corner.You keep reading just find out what happens next."
4,Hard to find performances,"Of course it would be better is some authentic Hebridean singers had done these in their down home styles, but most of these songs are seldom performed or recorded. I bought it for ""An Eriskay Love Lilt"" and was pleased to see a total of 34 songs on the album. All of these should work well as material for our local Celtic Chorus group."
3,3 of 5,"The title track, trance-inducing ride music for space cars, is the best track. Most of the others serve as filler. The gist of the album, presented as the debut of Bass 305 and DM Records, centers around a celebration of computer-generated bass sounds, with stock vocal samples mixed-in for measure. Techno seems to be the music of choice; the first of many similarly-titled, and sub-titled, songs is Techno Bass; but there's also a lot of hip-hop inspired energy flowing here.marcellee.com"
2,A sub-par Bass 305 debut...,"Bass 305's debut album, Digital Bass, isn't a bad debut album, per se, but it's marred by way too much hip-hop/rap influence unlike Bass 305's succeeding albums -which showcase more electronic bass and other sounds to create techno-bass music. Granted, the CD thumps and one can show of one's subwoofer with this album, but 305's later material such as ""Bass The Future"" and ""Departure"" are much more complex and refined.Only Only recommended to a die-hard bass completist."
2,"Talk, Talk","Edited by John Varnow, the 1979 album is dialogue from media interviews with John Lydon, Paul Cook, Steve Jones and Sid Vicious and radio advertisements, with the first track being a montage from a variety of sources.It had surprising success on the UK album chart - peaking at #6 - and ranges from amusing (Cook and Jones during a radio interview) to tedious (Lydon rambling on about a number of subjects). The Jamie Reid artwork - in not-too-subtle fashion - captures the pop culture myths surrounding the band, but this product is only for those who are seeking every ""official"" release from the iconic punk rockers."
4,Rare and Offensive!,"This is an interview-complication of the Sex Pistol members, taken from radio/TV-shows, 1976-78! One of the highlights is the Bill-Grundy show, from 1976, but unfortunatly; The hole thing is not there!!! Sid and Johnny comes up with some outstanding comments during the interviews, and the hole thing is very funny and interresting! For Mr. Joe Public: Keep away (or get offended), and for the fake-pretend-punks: Spend some bucks!!"
4,Where we have been.,This documentary as about the history of Afro-Americans defending and fighting for our United States of America from before the beginning of the country thru Afganastan. A look and history that has long been neglected by mainstream history.
2,"very good, but","I had already purchased this product once. I had lent it out to a good friend, and he had really loved it because he said his children could really relate with the history behind it. So I let him keep it. I ordered another copy but a used one and unbeknowns to me i received a "" High School version"" that was considerably shorter and a lot less information. If I would have know that there was a shorter condensed version I would have bought the NEW Version, which in fact was the complete version. I'm not sure if you are a where, but there are two versions. But they are not listed on your AMAZON website as such. I'll have to order the complete version at another time.That being said, I believe i have watched it 20 times. And everyone that I lend it to just loves it.....!!!"
4,For love of history,A well-done overview of the triumphs and struggles of blacks in the military. Should be required viewing in American History classes.
3,Black History,I think this was an excellent DVD and should be used in grade school history classes. So little is known about our history as it really was and I think this would be a great teaching tool.
3,grand theft autumn,"this music sounds like leaves changing color and falling to the ground. it will make you think of the feeling of a sweater around your shoulders and the mist in your mouth. the music is solid and the guitar and drum work is slightly technical and jazzy. the vocals are fitting to the music but tend to grate after a few listens. the lyrics are quite bad...and they unfortuatley can spoil some of the more musically tender moments. but there is some (at times, naive) beauty within these songs."
4,Beautiful,"A slow paced album with beautiful guitar riffs, numbing lyrics, and intricate drumming. Add in time signatures most bands won't even dream of touching and you have a masterpiece that makes you want to grab a cup of coffee and stare out the window on cold winter days."
5,HOW DARE YOU...,"...comparing this album to Good Charlotte or BLink 182 and then speaking of Dante? What's that about?That's the worst level of pseudo-sophisticated I've ever, ever read!That's like comparing Goethe to Stephen King, or Structuralism to sitcom strategies...This has nothing to do with Punk, Pop or whatever you associate with Sum 41 (oh god, it even hurts to write it down in an american footall review).I think it's brilliant. It's one of the best records I've stumbled over in the last years. Let it grow on you."
5,I love this cd,"Beautiful songs that mellow you out, while still being full with great understandable vocals, great guitar riffs and awesome drums. This band has everything it takes to make a great album and they did it here. Beautifully crafted, this is one of those cds where you can just put in in your cd player and listen to the whole thing without skipping through tracks looking for the good ones. Everytime a track ends im excited for the next one to start up, very thankful that this cd exists"
1,"""GM from Bay Area"" was right ...","Yeah, wow, what an anti-septic, soulless mess of an album. ""GM from Bay Area"" was 100-percent ""on"" with his assessment, and I honestly cannot respect anyone who follows this hack-music. This is like disco for the ""death-of-guitars"" sect."
4,"Mellow, Melancholy, and pure mega awesomness.","This CD is not rocking at all, in fact it's really really mellow. AF is real emo. It's a cd to wake up to, to listen to on rainy days. ON days you're feeling down and want to feel that glimse of hope still rings. this is the cd."
4,Very appealing to the fans of laid back music with substance,"American Football became an instant soft music favorite of mine. His voice is comforting to the say the least and the musicianship is just as soothing. However, this is not mindless mellow stuff that only serves a purpose when you are trying to fall asleep. It is much more deep, each song has a story to tell and even the instrumentals are beautifully written. It's difficult to classify this, I guess Emo works for me. I try to refrain from thinking too much about genres, the bottom line for me is I like this music. And, after you have read my description you are interested, don't hesitate. Give these guys a try."
5,FANTASTIC Little Mics!,"Like many I'm sure, the size of this microphone initially turned me off. Given the opportunity to try out a pair from a friend that bought but never really used them, I decided to take them out to record a concert at a local high school. Band, Choir, Orchestra, Percussion Ensemble, EVERYTHING. These little mics blew me away! Incredible sound quality. I put them a little back from center stage in a Y pattern and they picked up a beautiful balance from all parts of the stage and their cardioid pattern minimized the coughs and chair squeaks picked up in the background while allowing enough applause to pass through. I'm in love with these mics and I go for them every time I record now. Don't let the size fool you!"
2,Not recommended,"Not sure what the point of these are. Dress-up your junk? Duh.I think they are made for guys/girls who want a black fantasy.The rubber is really thick.The condom is really short and tight. Only went 1/2 way on my 7.25"" unit."
5,the hidden musical treasure,"for those of us who are not familiar with classical music, this is a must have cd. This music is exquisite. For all music fans, this cd is a musical legacy."
5,Fun Read--The Critics got this one Right!,"Far better than Francine Prose' ""Blue Angel"", with ""Thinks..."" the critics, often like sheep, simply praising one another, got this book right. It's great, absorbing, never boring by a creative experimental and master story teller. Read this ASAP... 5 Stars from a compulsive reader... Perfect for summer fare."
3,no action and the thinking isn't fresh,"I used to be in this field, or near it, and I was prepared to beamused if nothing else. I was, a bit: I know some people like RalphMessenger and certainly his style of thinking and argumentation isfamiliar, although his real-world counterparts probably spend moretime worrying about funding than sex. However, I didn't care for thenovel very much. The philosphical ideas are old hat, and the rest ofthe novel is just boring: there's nothing significant at stake for anyof the characters, and not much really happens except for theprotracted preliminaries to an affair. The subtext of the novel wouldseem to be Lodge's own seduction by the new (to him) ideas ofcognitive science, and his bemused reactions from the perspective ofthe humanities. There's been much better novelistic depictions ofinteraction between the two cultures (ie, in the work of RichardPowers)."
2,Shut up,"to the person below, please shut up and never get the balls to call hatebreed a nu metal band when every other band on the cd besides Lamb of God are nu metal bands so just die."
2,Not one of the better anatomy books,"There are much better books out there if you want to learn to draw the figure and understand anatomy. Sheppard is a decent artist, but his style isn't particularly clear, or beautiful, or any other adjective that would make it ideal for instruction. While this book is fairly cheap, that's only because it's short and seems very dated. No one book is going to make you an anatomy expert, but unless you don't know any better, I think you'll be sorely disappointed with this one."
1,"Terrible, frustrating book","I am currently using this book in a college level figure drawing class. I have no previous experience with human anatomy, and this book has not proved to be at all useful. I have found the illustrations of the more complex parts of the body (such as the vertebrae) to be generalized and vague. Because of this, I have struggled to understand how to interpret Sheppard's lines, especially when it comes to small, detailed areas. Besides that, the style of illustration is extremely dated and obnoxious. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone, and I would especially warn those who have not studied anatomy not to expect any clarification from this wretched, wretched book."
3,Not bad as a starting place!,"I found that the range of poses and angles for noses, eyes and the mouth were very useful. I also thought that it was a lot less like a medical book than some, which from my point of view was good. The charcoal/chalk images are fine for gaining an idea of where you want to go, but they do lack detail. I think this book is an ideal reference book but should be used in conjunction with others."
5,DELICIOUS!,"Wow! Each paragraph brings unexpected & unforced giggles that seem to just creep up! Paul's insight into people, their motivations, aspirations & daring is refreshing, to say the least. As a Latvian-American familiar with Latvian pagan tradition, I am just amazed at his delicacy of spirit & understanding of the sources of this tradition's solace and power - e.g. sitting in a tree. What a broad vision of the human spirit! Savor each word!Nebrauc tik dikti, tie nav tavi kumelini!"
1,From Fellow Bay Area/Tuscan:Tremendous Disappointment,"Under The Tuscan Sun was terrific. It was refreshing and had an interesting plot for a non-fiction book: how will the acquisition and restoration of Bramasole work out? All of us who have fantasized about doing what Ms. Mayes did were intrigued. Bella Tuscany, however, is pure trash. No intrigue, no hook and outright boring. Moreover, it is poorly writtenand has virtually no educational worth. Ms. Mayes and Ed should stick to writing poetry which is not read by anyone but students. Moreover, she should leave the Cortona area alone. Citizens of the area are tired of her and the publicity she has invited. Now that she has made a few bucks, maybe she will just blend into the beautiful Tuscan environment and let the world's spotlight tarnish some other area."
1,Good News if you HATE this book,I was able to recycle mine on Amazon auctions. This is the nicest thing I can say about a dreadful book.
1,"It's making her money, but it's worthless","After writing one beautiful book (Under the Tuscan Sun), Frances Mayes has now produced a shockingly awful and bloated chronicle of self-indulgent middle-brow drivel, redolent of boring childhood adventures, septic tanks, monogrammed linen, and 200 kinds of bushes no one cares about (except Ed). If this book were literally tripe, we could at least eat it. As it is, it sits in our lap as uselessly as a dead, hideously deformed platypus."
1,Just Terrible,"I can't read this book. I have tried multiple times, but I find this author to be arrogant, emotional detached, impersonal, boring, unimaginative, superficial and in need of an English lesson or two. I will burn this book, as I could not conscientiously allow another individual to suffer the pain of reading this book.My perspective may be spoiled, as I just finished reading the Olive Farm series by Carol Drinkwater. If anyone is interested in reading about rural life in Southern Europe, then the Olive Farm series should either satisfy your imagination, or make you move to Southern France. At all cost, avoid reading Bella Tuscany by Frances Mayes."
4,A Beautiful Engagement Calendar,"When I ordered the Bella Tuscany Engagement Calendar, I also ordered one for a friend. When they came I was really amazed to see the beautiful pictures of Italy in the book. Brings back a lot of memories to me. I would recommend this book to all my friends.."
4,Bella Tuscany,"I read this book shortly after returning from my first visit to Florence and the surrounding Tuscany area. It was like revisiting the area with an experienced tour guide. If you've never been there, Frances Mayer may convince you to go. If you have, she captures the real essence of Tuscany and it's a pleasure to revisit the sights and smells along with her."
2,Disappointing,"Glad I got this from the library. I hadn't read the first book, but saw the movie Under the Tuscan Sun. I found the book rather confusing at the beginning--it's like she just plunked you down in Italy and you were supposed to know about ""Ed"" (WHO is he? Husband, boyfriend?) and the gardner.....don't remember anything about gardening in the movie, but the book starts out with all this talk about plants and gardens. The book is 286 pages and I'm on page 80 and not sure I can read anymore. Seems like a catalog of plants, trees, museums. I thought I would get to know the Italian culture but this book seems so shallow. After reading other reviews, apparently it gets worse with her whining, so I'm not real motivated to finish it. Never did understand where she got all the money to just up and move to Italy in the first place and spend unlimited funds on renovating a house. Skip this book."
1,Author's petty comments spice up otherwise boring book,"Author's very unhospitable comments about houseguests, especially the vicious gang bashing during the expats dinner, and her superior attitude and degrading comments about other people's bad Italian make you cringe for those who will recognize themselves. These things reveal far more about the author than anything else in the book. Obviously none of the good things about Tuscany have rubbed off on the author."
1,How to Finance an Italian Villa,"at the expense of the reading public, would be a more appropriate title. How did this silly book get such good reviews. Who are these people? I'll trust the Amazon rating public before I ever trust the ""pros"" again. This book is weak, annoying, and just plain foolish. And I adore cooking, gardening and wine. Wish I'd thought of this idea first ... I'd be writing from Italy."
2,Not quite the longed for sequel.,"Sequels often don't hold up to the standards of the original, and this one is no exception. It's still a very pleasant travel journal about Italy, but it has no cohesive central story line. The first volume was held together by the restoration and discovery themes; this one has only some new discoveries. In fact, it has too many reveries about her childhood in Georgia for my taste. So if you enjoyed the last one and crave some more Italian life and escapism, it's here, but not altogether satisfying or exciting."
1,Monogrammed linens are stimulating stuff,"It was so bad I don't know where to start. I was interested in Tuscany, instead I spent my time at Ed's parents during Christmas in Minnesota, Ashley's wedding in California, hearing what Ed and Frances saw and ate .... I don't even know how to finish it. I'd like to figure out how to get my money back after having paid for the hard copy version!"
3,SWEET LIFE,"I enjoyed the book a little more than ""under the tuscan sun"" but the ""money is no object"" lifestyle. I guess we all know these two people have money, but someone with a little more class would not make this fact so abundantly clear....and does not add to the book. I really did not care about the ""New"" House in San Francisco. Most of the book read like a family christmas letter and what happened over the year. You will get a better insight into some of the regions and towns that they travel to, but again it is thur the eyes of Frances Mayes.....if you want a travel book buy Rick Steves."
1,Tuscauy Calender,"the one you show is for 2001,, we are now at the end of 2002 and going into 2003 do you think you can update the site?"
4,sweet book about the sweet life,"This was the first Frances Mayes book I had ever read; I must be one of the few who bipassed Under the Tuscan Sun (probably because I really didn't like the movie). However, I do love to travel-though I don't have the money to go as I'd like- and I really like Italy, and for those reasons, I found this a delightful read. I love the descriptions of living the sweet life in ways that I can only dream about doing. As with some other reviewers, I find Mayes a bit ""whiny,"" and in this regard, she seems like a spoiled child occasionally, but overall her descriptions of people and food and landscapes and problems is just simply beautiful. She has inspired me to be a better writer. I would love to meet her one day."
4,A worthy sequel to Under The Tuscan Sun.,"While Under The Tuscan Sun made me long to live in Italy, Bella Tuscany inspired me to travel in Tuscany. My friend Peggi and I read the book before arriving in Tuscany this past April. We carried it our car and tried to follow Ms. Mayes many daytrips. She has captured the soul of Tuscany and her Italian caretakers - and certainly enhanced our visit with her insights. I might also add that Bramasole is more beautiful even than her descriptions. Ms. Mayes has a way of taking the reader into the everyday life of Tuscany, and feeling right at home. Brava!"
2,A good book ruined by careless error.,"Bella Tuscany gets off to a good start, continuing the charm of Under the Tuscan Sun. And then. And then! Author Mayes, a professor of English and native Georgian, calls Sidney Lanier's classic poem ""The Marshes of Glenn"" instead of ""Glynn."" For shame!"
2,"Pretty prose, but very little content.","Now that her vacation get-away in Tuscany has been renovated, the olives planted ... Frances Mayes has run out of things to say. There are only so many pages of people eating and gardening and lounging in their lemonarias that one can stand. The vignettes of Italian life that made ""Under the Tuscan Sun"" so delightful are all but absent here. Frances Mayes and her husband appear to be spoiled academics with too much money and time on their hands. It is difficult to sympathize with their minor construction problems as if they are life tragedies."
2,"pleasant, but","an ok read, (helps a lot if you like gardening) but pretty thin; leaves you wanting to find another book with a lot more substance; although parts make you crave Tuscany. Preferred Mates Hills of Tuscany. Finished reading it thinking they wrote it to finance house renovation - it read passionless."
2,Sequel Slump,I enjoyed Under the Tuscan Sun but Mayes turned me off at the beginning of this book with her discussion of the Mafia. Her feeling the oppression of the Sicilian people was extremely pretentious. She should stick to describing the renovations of her home and descriptions of daily life in Tuscany. Spare us the insights about social problems and paranoia about the Mafia.
3,If wishes were horses we'd be eating steak,"I get that it is the sweet life in Tuscany. I get that Frances Mayes works her [...] off planting roses and whirling all over the country side searching for the prefect tile for the butterfly bathroom. I get that she became an overnight success and very well know because of a movie based so loosely on her book Under the Tuscan Sun it was an eerily reminder of Demi Moore's version of The Scarlet Letter. I have never set foot in Italy although I know people who have. Frances Mayes is not one of them. Bully for you. I feel very put out by the book jacket glossing over all the really depressing things that run all over the ""sensuous and evocative prose."" And what was in the package Ed had in his suitcase for her for Christmas - what is the bloody point in saying how small it was if we don't get to find out what it was! It was like reading the ramblings of a spoiled child."
2,Boring,"I am about half way through the book and can't bring myself to read another page. I only read this far hoping that soon it would become as interesting as her first book, but sadly I feel I've wasted enough time listening to the boring rants of wine, gardens, and other writers... If you'd like to read whole chapters devoted to describing gardens and flowers and if you like to whole chapters devoted to recipes she's come across while in Tuscany, you'll enjoy this book. The only parts I enjoyed were her travels to other parts of the country."
1,Book Club Disaster,"Last night my book club got together to discuss this wretched book. All of us absolutely *did not* like the book.Mayes shallow, stereotyped images disgusted me, it was as though she presented a Disney-fied version of what the citizens of Tuscany were like. Mayes comes across as a snob, and one who doesn't even live an interesting life. She's rude, but not outlandishly so, I couldn't even qualify this as a guilty pleasure reading."
1,why is it called Bella Tuscany?,"I keep wondering why she chose the title ""Bella Tuscany"". I feel the title only fits if the book takes place pretty much completely in Tuscany. However,the book takes us to various locals in the US as well as to regions in Italy other than Tuscany. I feel the title of the book misleads people into thinking they'll get the focus on Tuscany that her first book had. I feel it would have been more effective for the book to have a title that would more acurately reflect its content."
2,Disappointing meanderings of Frances Mayes mind,"Having read Frances Mayes ""Under the Tuscan Sun"" I eagerly anticipated reading her latest creation,vicariously wandering the countryside of Tuscany and enjoying Italian cuisine.Other than the enjoyable dust jacket of the book ""Bella Tuscany"" the book is a tremendous disappointment. I have doggedly read 203 pages and will finish Ms. Mayes metaphysical look at Italy, however,it has been more about her meandering mind than her wandering feet. I particularly missed the wonderful recipes that were interspersed throughout her first book. They all made my mouth water in anticipation of my next trip to Italy. These recipes were perfunctory and very unimaginative and left me with, not a deliciously sated feeling but hunger pangs."
2,a very mediocre and biased account of Italy,"While this book was enjoyable in parts, I just don't see what sets this book apart from other travelogues. I'm glad the author enjoys living and entertaining in Tuscany (who wouldn't) and tending to her garden, but the bottom line is that I just didn't find these vignettes all that interesting. Maybe it's because I'm not a gardener - I tended to identify more with the eating and cooking aspects of the book which were at least lively and interesting. If you're visiting Italy or just like armchair travel you may enjoy perusing this book. It's passable, just not the most exciting book I've ever read. I think most generic travel guides (like the Rough Guide) are more interesting reads.Plus, even though she claims to be the sensitive American living in Italy, she has so many silly mafia stereotypes and ""canned"" portraits of Italians that I almost didn't recognize Italy from the actual weeks I've spent travelling through the country. Mediocre by any standard."
5,Bella Tuscany,"I had re-read Under the Tuscan sun, I love Frances Mayes style of writting and I love I Italy, I could litterly see it in her writing and when I did see actual pictures it was as I imagined love the book and will re-read it to at some time, have gotten her other 2 books as well"
4,A dreamy and humorous look at Tuscan life.,"I thought this was an excellent read. The chapter ""lost in translation"" was hillarious. The wedding/housewarming at the end was a nice twist."
2,Too much rambling,"I enjoyed UTTS and thought Bella Tuscany would be better or just as entertaining. There was too much digression about plants one has never heard of, ancestors and life in the deep South plus the new house in St Francis Woods and elite area of San Francisco which the first book no doubt financed. Disappointing!!!"
1,No sour grapes -- just plain disappointment,"I finally had to remove Bella Tuscany from my bedside table because I knew I was never going to finish it. It's been sitting there for months waiting patiently to be finished and the guilt is killing me.I am a huge fan of Mayes and adored Under the Tuscan Sun. I couldn't put the book down and I sighed, daydreamed and planned a vacation to Italy through the whole book. I snapped up Bella Tuscany ready to soak up a bit more of Tuscany and their lives there. Instead of sweet, leisurely Tuscan days it was a disappointing bitter pill. I never got into the book and had to force myself to read 100 pages. Ever since I abandoned Bella Tuscany I thought if I could get ""in the right mood"" I would adore it. But, I realize that's not going to happen. Hopefully book number 3 will be better. If not I will cherish Under the Tuscan Sun and find other travel writers to read."
2,Not as good as the first,"I liked the first book better, in which the book described the ongoing risky theme of an American couple buying and restoring an ancient house in Italy. This one has none of that excitement, and shows signs of elitism and snobbery. It's apparently ok to slam Winona, Minnesota (and thus, it's people) because it gets a little cold in the Winter, and it's grocery stores don't meet her qualifications for fresh vegetables. House guests also get dumped on for eating up her private time but that's what happens when you choose to expose your life and house via a book.I prefer more humble travel writers."
1,charming but shallow,"This is a charming read if you love Italy, but the author gets lost about half way though the book and pads out what is basically a very long travel piece. From someone who teachers creative writing you'd expect something a little less self absorbed."
1,Disappointing,"I loved her first book, but ""Bella"" was a letdown in many ways. ""Tuscan Sun"" had a spontaneous, joyous feel to it; but ""Bella"" felt very self conscious. When the author took off for Sicily, I got the distinct feeling she was saying, ""Got to write another bestseller! Got to find fodder!""It was preachy (I don't care for the mafia, either, but please, I don't need the author trying to turn a travelogue into a diatribe!).Also, I got the feeling that the author might be a bit difficult. When she rented a suite and then demanded another room, I kept thinking, Gee, would she have done that before bestsellerdom went to her head? True, there were shades of meanness in ""Tuscan Sun,"" especially when she was acting snide about the workmen, but I felt the author was on stage here, not the country or (especially) the writing.By the way, the part about the ""winds"" of Italy has already been done--and far better--by Michael Ondaatje, in THE ENGLISH PATIENT."
2,Eh...the first one was MUCH better.,"Sorry, Ms. Mayes, but I think your first swing through Italy was better. ""Under the Tuscan Sun"" was a fabulous book. ""Bella Tuscany"" pales by comparison. I do still love the descriptions and the wonderful places, but I feel that we're between a story and a travellogue with this entry. Actually, I'm rather hoping that Mayes' next book *is* a travellogue of all of the wonderful places we should all visit in Tuscany! I appreciate the fact that Ed is more present in this book than in the first -- nice to ""meet"" him more, at last!"
1,torturous monotone narration ruins exquisite writing,"The writing is exquisite; however, the author's monotone southern accented voice makes listening torture. I adored her first book, and really tried to give this a go, but had to stop after one cassette of cringing at the slow unrelenting monotone and the frequent southern-American accented Italian words. Torture. Why on earth did the publisher allow the author to do this?"
2,It hit me what I don't like about this book,"Her descriptive language is well thought out, but almost no emotion comes through in this humorless travelogue. She shares very little about herself and her feelings and the book is left with being a very well written still life."
2,Disappointing,"I had heard about UtTS and how wonderful it was, so when a copy of Bella Tuscany came my way, I grabbed it happily. Perhaps I didn't give Mayes enough of a chance: I assumed she would be a female version of Peter Mayle, and write with joy and humor.After about a third of the way through, I was thoroughly sick of her whining and sniveling. Her descriptions of food and landscape and wine, I thought, were less than dazzling, less than enamoured - they were more like descriptions from a creative writing class. Mayes became a traveling companion that annoyed me, someone who could not appreciate her good fortune, a drain on anyone's good humor.I never did finish the book. I couldn't see my way to spend another moment with Mayes."
1,"Like most movies; loved the first one, hated the sequel.","Having just finished reading her first book about Tuscany, ""Under the Tuscan Sun"", a charming and compelling narrative about restoring an old house in the hills of Tuscany and learning to live in Italy, and having just returned from a trip to Italy myself, I could hardly wait to read this book. I should have saved the $15 and spent it on a few more bowls of that wonderful Italian chocolate gelato.... I guess when you pour years worth of experiences into a book, it's hard to come up with something else to say fast enough to get a sequel out while the money machine is still spitting out bills.I think I will go back and re-read her first book, so that the impression that sticks in my mind is not the horrible sense of disappointment that grew worse with each page of this book.Sigh..."
1,"Too wealthy, too contented","The ""Bella Italia"" industry cranks up again, when our smug and self-satisfied rich Americans deal with the quaint natives once again. How many times over the two books do we have to be told about the sufferings on the bank account caused by renovating a country villa in the most expensive region of Italy? Oh, yeah, for sure! If she really wants to know anything about Sicily and the mafia (""I never heard anyone say mafia in a whole week!"" she exclaims breathlessly. No, they don't tend to go round talking about it, and when they do, the term mafia is not usual...at least amongst my Sicilian relatives!)....Ms Mayes..read Peter Robb's ""Midnight In Sicily""."
1,A waste of time and money,"Ms. Mayes' smug, contrite, superior attitude is a total turn-off. If I could give this book a zero star rating I would. This book has none of the charm and warmth and character of her first book. I didn't buy this book to read about her childhood or her parents or her siblings. I didn't buy this book to read about Minnesota, her house in California, or her daughter's wedding. I didn't buy this book to read about her trashing her houseguests. I didn't buy this book to read poetry, or her opinion of art. Ms. Mayes should really be ashamed of herself."
1,Opportunistic Diletante,"Many superb books have been written about buying and restoring old homes and discovering new and engaging cultures. Frances Mayes has vulgarized the genre. That may be her only claim to the fame she so clearly covets in the world of letters. I truly hope she spends the rest of her days in the California she claims she hates so much. This for making me suffer through her ""writing"". Bella Italia deserves so much more...so do we. Try "" A Tuscan Childhood"". It's a wonderful read!"
2,Next time just tweet,"There are some delightful moments in the book - how could you live in a villa in Arezzo and not encounter them? - but they are marred by the whining, by the hatchet job on Sicily (believe it or not, other people living in or visiting Sicily don't spend their time looking for a Mafia Don around every corner), as well as by other less direct hints that the author is, in the end, just another visitor with money who lacks the soul of an Italian."
4,good book,Enjoyable and fun. Shipped quickly and well packaged. Got it for mom and had to read myself. Anyone who liked the movie under the Tuscan sun should read this
3,Italy in the spring,"I read Bella Tuscany, by Frances Mayes (she of Under the Tuscan Sun fame), while on vacation. This is the kind of armchair traveling that I love. Mayes writes of Tuscany in language dripping with both adoration and vibrant description. She writes of food, of gardens, of little side trips she and her husband take. It's an easy, quick read, with some recipes sprinkled in here and there that I will probably try. Worth looking in to.And now I feel that I have to go to Italy in the spring. Heh."
2,Bella Tuscany,Anyone who loved the movie Under the Tuscan Sun should not expect the same manner of stories from Frances Mayes' books. They are like watching someone else's vacation photos. You just had to be there.
3,okay,"I sometimes wonder if digital really suits Satie. The hard fact of the matter is that digital is very representitive of what you hear in real life, whereas vinyl is distorted by a warmth that isn't necessarily there. So I question whether this is a decent enough performance or whether it would sound better on vinyl to create a warmth that isn't really there in the playing..."
2,Expected too much,My two preschoolers love to sing. We thought this would be great for them. We have run into a few problems and are disappointed.1. The microphone cord is extremely short.2. The microphone sound is tempermental IF you get any sound to go through at all.3. Ours is hard to turn on and get any music to play.4. All those blocks make a cluttery mess.My kids leave the jukebox in the toyroom and carry the unconnected microphone around and just walk about singing on their own.
3,Did Not Love It....Did Not Hate It,"Unlike most of the other reviewers, I am dead in the middle on this one. I read it because a trusted friend assured me I would enjoy it. He was correct....to a point.This novel offers interesting perspectives on feudal times in France and the Holy Land and a thought provoking view of the Crusades and of the medievil Catholic church. The story itself runs hot and cold though. It starts reasonably well, bogs down badly in the middle and then picks up nicely at the end. Stylistically, I felt the author got carried away with details and with the sound of his own words (at least 100 pages could have been edited out with no harm done to the story). Also, I felt that the sexual scenes were overdone and could have been lifted from a drugstore romance novel.In the final analysis, I am glad I stayed with this, but it was a real chore at times."
4,Pleasant Vendor,"The book arrived damaged by USPS. The vendor immediately arranged to have another book sent, and he was very kind. The second book arrived quickly, but unlike the first (which was in new condition), the second book had slightly yellowed page edges, as if it was slightly used."
1,"Long Winded, Boring Diatribe","What a pathetic excuse for an ""adventure"" novel. This book is overly long by about 200-300 pages, and consists in the main of endless navel contemplation and long discussions of how the Church has supposedly ruined Western society over lo these many years. The "" action"" sequences are few, far between, and not that convincing. If this tome is the first of a planned trilogy, I shudder to think ! I picked this book up on a whim at Costco; I am at least glad that I didn't pay full price! If you are someone who believes in Dan Brown's absurd ""DaVinci Code"", then this turgid disaster may be right up your alley. For those who have a firm grip on history, I suggest run sceaming from this one."
2,Not Templar History,"If you like ""stories"" then this is a good book to read.It is not anywhere close to the real Templar History (but it is fairly good fiction).Some ""information"" is taken from fact/history, but the story is, all in all just that(a story).If your concerned with actual facts and history, then this is not the book for you.If you want to just have something to read,to pass the time away....then you might like this book."
1,axe grinding,"I am very open minded but obviously this guy has an ax to grind with Christians....exactly as the title describes; there is not ONE decent christian in the book(black); ALL of the Jewish characters are model citizens NONE of them ever do anything remotely base(white) what a JOKE...don't bother even if you are tempted! why not just write this book: Jewish people are good, Christians are evil...at least you would be giving an accurate portrayal of the contents of the book."
2,Not for History Lovers,"Mr. Whyte seems to have done his research for this book by watching old Robert Taylor movies. There is nothing in this work that made me for one minute believe I was in the Middle Ages -- no sights, sounds, smells, tastes. There are so many historical inaccuracies it would be impossible to list them, including the absolute worst -- the one where knights walk around wearing armor all day. You don't even see that in kids' books. Plus, the characters -- with the exception of the minx temptress Alice -- are all one dimensional. I give this a 2 because the author keeps the story going, but if you want any kind of realism regarding the Middle Ages or the Crusades, you would be advised to go elsewhere."
2,No character development,"I read the entire novel after loathing the first 200 pages in honor of how much i respected Jack Whyte as the author of my favorite novels of all time in the Camulod series. The novel was over 700 pages and by the time I finished the book I felt like I did not know a single character. I do not know what happened to Whyte: halfway through the Skystone I felt I knew Publius Varrus very well. It may be Whyte is not near as skilled in writing in the third person. The novel had an alright storyline, except the lack of context with which the treasure is found is aggravating, but it was the utter lack of true character development that made me give the novel only two stars. I was extremely disappointed with this novel, especially after reading the Camulod Chronicles."
2,piqued,"piqued. as ""insulted"".He could probably save himself a lot of dialogue. It's a misuse of privilege. The profesional term is ""anachronistic"". And he sure does abuse it.Don't get me wrong - I do admire the effort. It is admirable! I enjoyed the research, I loved the circumstance, derring-do, forbidden cults and whatnot.Best of all - the Jograffy.Buy the book and find out. I will not spoil yer pleasure."
1,Disappointing,"As another reviewer has said, those who loved the Camulod chronicles will be disappointed by this new story. It seems Mr. Whyte couldn't decide if he was writing an alternative history book or a novel, and ended up writing neither. Long pedantic discussions by men of action seem rigged to hammer a particular viewpoint (and hammer, and hammer, and...), and characters who could be explored in an interesting way (in particular Hugh de Payens) are given shallow treatment at best. There is no edge in the story, no grip, and no passion.I was looking forward to reading more of Whyte's work since I so enjoyed the Camulod tales, but this book didn't give me any satisfaction."
2,"Clunky writing, sloppy research","Sadly, this book is very poorly done. Historical ""facts"" are inaccurate, for example, maintaining that Paul was a Gentile and the Knights Hospitaller were never a military order. The dialogue is so painfully clunky that a reader really has to force his way through the murk. I gave up at about halfway through, and I'm a very patient reader. I cannot recommend the book to anyone."
5,I Love This Book,"This is the second romance I read and it is still my favorite! Maragret Moore's writing is fantastic, and few authors can outwrite her!"
2,unrealistic story,"the characters in this book lack realism , the author states that Raymond is a man to be feared and one who will never give his heart to another woman other than his first wife whom he killed, but within a few chapters he is vowing his love for Elizabeth. Sweet Elizabeth who has been raised in a convent her entire childhood vows that if Raymond will accept her as his bride in lieu of her cousin whom he was formely betrothed that she will be a good wife and never disobey. As soon as the vows are repeated she begins to disobey her husband in foolish unbelieveable ways. Even for fiction these people were unreal. No depth of character to make me really want to find out what happened to these people. Frankly not sure he killed his wife i think she may have died of boredom."
5,Helpful Advice,This is a good resource for those suffering from sciatica - anything that works for you will certainly be a relief. good Luck.
3,Just OK,"I purchased this just to round out an order. I guess I am not sure what I expected, but for the amount of nails and sizes I think the price was too high. You would be better off buying a box of nails that you need rather than this."
3,DRYWALL TEXTURE,"Have utilized a friend with a ""standard"" pattern gun previously, but decided to get one of these units for myself. The item(s) that caught my eye were the closed lid and spring loaded top to provide down pressure to the spray gun.Unit was easy to load and use, especially with no fear of spills.One thing lacking for me was a better set of instructions...with a new tool, it's always helpful to have comments and suggestions for use from the manufacturer. If my friend had not been there to lead me through on the set-up and mixing, I would have had a long day of guessing and keeping my temper.Also, no markings on the patterns as to which is what size and they are plastic...not a real fan of plastic parts on tools.Overall, it did what it was supposed to do for me.I do review this website prior to any tool purchase. Am in agreement with the reviewer having problems with a thick mix like stucco. We had to thin the texture mix about 25% thinner than the same mix with a ""standard"" pattern gun."
1,Useless for stucco,"I bought this texture gun to spray the finish stucco coat. But, I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone. After reading the previous 2 reviews on this product, I decided to make the mixture a bit thinner. For the first 5 minutes or so, everything was ok. Then, the nozzle keeps getting stuck, and I had to throw out all my stucco and flush out the system with water. This went on alternately for the next 5 or 6 attempts. The next day, and texture gun gave up completely; apparently some air leaked out of it and it wouldn't even spray at all. I then gave the product to a handyman to try to make it work, and he tried for more than an hour but to no avail. Who wants a product which only functions intermittently for one day and then breaks down? Don't waste your money until they improve their gun."
1,Disingenuous,"Cecil B. Currey owned up to the pseudonym Cincinnatus in conjunction with being outed by Col. Harry Summers and Washington Post publisher Donald Graham as a U.S. National Guard chaplain who had never served in Vietnam: His implied""bona fides"" are bogus but he blithely goes on to declaim on this war...See B.G. Burkett's book Stolen Valor and ""Army Critic Unmasked"" by Michael Getler in The Washington Post for details."
5,Great,"My dog loves to play tug-o-war, so I bought her two of these. She LOVES them. It's the only rope toy she wants to play with."
3,not for my dog,"I like this, but my dog, not so much! I bought this play rope for my dog, but for her, all she did was sniff it, and left it completely alone! Yes, it does have the remnants of peanut butter, but after trying to offer this to my dog and play with her, she was just not interested. It now just sits in the corner with all of her toys.Seems she is more interested in playing with us than the this rope. The rope is quite sturdy and I am sure it will last for quite some time. Good luck to those of you who have dogs that will appreciate this toy!"
3,Bearing seems well designed but motor & gears aren't,"I was hanging a pretty heavy piece of art, so wanted a rotator with a metal - not plastic - case, and a low RPM. This seemed to fit the bill. The suspension thrust bearing looks great & sturdy, and comes with a very sturdy hook/caribiner. But it starts in a random direction, and eventually one direction started making grinding noises, which settled down after it had been running for a while. (If you unplug it then plug it in again, it will often reverse.) But within a few months it stopped turning entirely. Don't know if it was the cheap gears or the cheap (non-USA) motor. I don't expect parts to be available, and won't buy another, so now it's only good as a hanger. Too bad products aren't made to last anymore. This might be OK for very occasional use - but keep your fingers crossed."
1,Don't waste your money,"My son absolutely LOVES Jay Jay the Jet Plane, but didn't get into this software at all. The games are boring and I could just see the disappointment in his face. I'm glad I didn't pay full price, and instead bought it on clearance at a local retailer."
2,Something missing...Oh yeah...Sources!,"While the topics covered and material discussed in this little handy book are worth reading, the depth of knowledge in terms of science and the documentation of other sources is rather lacking. Kister uses other people's quotes as a crutch and the times he does use his own voice seem to fall short. The chapter on feedback systems especially. I'd hope a future edition will spell check his work, and also get the definition of albedo correct...it's reflectivity potential, not the amount of sunlight absorbed. And this is not known as the ""albeido effect"" either, it's just a way of looking at how much radiation from the sun is reflected rather than absorbed. For folks just trying to see the Alaskan side of the global warming issue, go for it. For someone looking for a more technical read...check out Weather Cycles by William James Burroughs"
2,Whoaaaa!,"I have been working out for 20 years, doing cardio, weight lifting, stepping, kickboxing, pretty much everything. Although I really like Tracy and Michelle's other videos, the pace of this one is just too fast. They are doing so many different things on the stepper, and it's too hard to keep up.I felt I spent most of the time trying to figure out what the heck they were doing. I know sometimes it just takes a few tries to get the hang of it, but this one was ridiculous.I liked the weight lifting part of it, at least I felt I got a workout from that. The movements on the stepper are just too complicated and there are too many of them incorporated into the workout. I was very disappointed."
5,Great workout!,"After trying Tracy and Michelle's ""Step it Off"" video only twice, I loved it so much that I bought this one too. This workout did not disappoint either. You have to pay attention to the cueing, and it's not meant for beginners. But I tackled this one without viewing it first, and I kept up with them. I missed a few steps here or there, but that's to be expected for a first time. If you can follow Kari Anderson or Petra Kolbert, you can do this. If I was new to stepping, this one probably would have made me cry, but I started stepping back in the days of Jane Fonda, so I know my way around a step bench. I got a great work-out. My only complaints are 1.) the DVD doesn't tell you how long the warm-up, workout, and cool-down are on the jacket or on the DVD menu, and 2.) the stretches seemed rushed to me. I usually end up stretching more on my own when the DVD is over. Aside from that...I love this DVD."
5,Super TV combo!,"I have used this product for almost 2 years, and it has performed flawlessly. Great picture and easy-to-use remote."
5,LOVE IT,"Ever since it landed in my hands I haven't stopped listening to it. Great sound, great dvd. Totally worth the cash! Would buy it again without a second thought! The autographed poster was a bonus!"
5,Amazing! Lots of tracks!,"This live CD/DVD set captures the essance of Nonpoint and their bombastic live show! Some of their greatest songs from the last 4 albums, and the DVD is very well made as well.Hands down, the best live rock album of the year!"
2,2 & 1/2 stars -- the least appealing of the series,"The trouble with this book is that the hero and heorine are difficult to genuinely like and root for. Marsh is bitter and vindictive and often cruel to Sarah. She simply has no common sense; she repeatedly makes atrocious decisions -- no wonder trouble always finds her.The book isn't horrible; the characters, even the romantic leads, have redeeming qualities and good scenes. But the work as a whole is less than fulfilling and the chemistry between the leads lacks convincing heat. Worse, it lacks the sort of love upon which a good romance hinges.The book is worth reading as part of the series, as long as the reader neither expects too much or is not put off from other books that follow. Perhaps the best character in this book is Sarah's sister's husband's nephew, Adrian Hawke. His story comes up in the Bridemaker, which is an excellent read."
3,Not thrilled with it...,"This one was a disappointment; Unfortunately, I didn't like the hero (????) at all until the end of the book. Although I could understand his anger, there was no excuse for him wanting to get vengence on innoccent people. I kept reading hoping that he'd redeem himself & it would get better. I made it through 173 pages, then he gave the heroine (who may be very loyal to her family, but shows an extreme lack of intelligence) a very cruel ultimatum & that almost made me lay the book down.... fact is the hero was an jerk, plain & simple.... at that point I could really have cared less if he redeemed himself or not. I guess in the end he did redeem himself, but he just wasn't hero material in my opinion."
2,not very good,I really didn't enjoy reading this book. I think we could've lived withouth knowing the life of Sarah Palmer. Very dissapointing plot and just plain boring. I bought it just because I had enjoyed the matchmaker so much unfortunately I was terribly dissapointed and wish I hadn't read it.
5,Fantastic writing !!!,"Author Brian Cull did a superb job in writing this outstanding book about RAF's top-scoring squadron of World War II. It's everything there: the air battles, the planes flown, the comic side of it, the lost lives. Fortunately, the author didn't forget to research the German side, giving the book an accuracy seldom found in WW II books. Fantastic!!!"
4,medicine can be toxic in excess,"Ilyich wrote this a generation-plus ago, yet his messages resonate today. We have depersonalized our lives in so many ways, by bringing the industrial model into realms that were meant for emotion, feeling, and art. The influx of industry-thought into medicine has torn the sensitive heart from many care-givers and patients alike. His text is a bit lengthy and is repetitive in spots, and can be challenged on the facts in others. Overall, his concerns about the choices we have made socially and medically remain valid."
5,"Another brilliant, well-written book by Illich!","In this book, much like Deschooling Society, Illich attacks the issue from all sides. He consistenly provides an excellent argument with examples, statistics, and well-done research. Though this book is not quite as fast-paced as Deschooling Society, it is equally engaging. Illich not only presents the problems in a realistic way, he also presents alternative methods for dealing with the issues he's attacking. This book is well worth the time it takes to read, and although it was written several years ago, the issues addressed in this book are even more prevalent now. Illich is a wonderful writer and this is an incredible book."
4,"Good way to pass time, then have a good model!","This model (F16) is good. it is good for when you are bored out of your mind and you need somthin to do. this thing takes an hour or two to make, how simple. good for kids."
3,TACTICAL NOT PRACTICAL,"Once again, here we are. We got done with this one in a little less than two hours. Nuthin to it. We were hoping for more of a challange, but we made up for that. When we were done, we fueled it up JP5 (that's jet fuel for all you novices). We turned on the turbines, and the whole thing just blew up. What a mess! The next door neighbor's cat got caught up in the fray, and didn't fair too well. Nothing like the smell of JP5 and burning car fur in the morning. Next time, we'll make sure that annoying neighbor's barking dog is close by."
1,poor quality,Mega bloks is a cheap product. They will not let you return items and the do not have replacement parts. I sent 3 emails and never heard back after 2 months. I had to call Canada my self at $6.00 a call and never received my replacement part. Toyrus would not take back. DO NOT BUY THIS
3,My project,It shocking when I got it. Then it was easy to put together so it wasn't so shocking after all. So I think I would need something harder to do at my leval. I like it but what do you think is a more fun one to do?ThanksDalton
2,Disappointed,"I have purchased other karaoke dvds, but this one was not good. The vocals make it a ""sing a long"" instead of a true karaoke mix. Very disappointed with this purchase. Wouldn't recommend."
3,"Listenable, different, and nothing extraordinary","I was introduced to the sound of Yost, oddly, at a college rave (6th Element), where his live set (with--sic--REAL instruments) was not exactly what the crowd wanted to hear. In fact, it nearly killed the tripped-out, adrenaline-heavy atmosphere (as I understand it was even hard to breakdance to). This is a more polished collection of that often nearly acid-jazzy sound. A blaring sax often steals tracks inexplicably, a turning point for sensitive opinions, and there are other quite organic sounds throughout. Even the beats are occasionally drawn from a ""manual"" drum pad, adding to what is at least a contrast with most techno. Much approaches danceability, but the majority of the electronic crowd might be too entranced to notice."
5,Thank you!,This is perfect for a college course I am taking in sociology. Very insightful in light of development's in today's society.
5,Victimology,"Book came within 3 days of purchase, the book was ""used"" but in perfect condition, and at about 50 dollars less than book store on campus, I would buy from them again in a heart beat"
3,Wedged shoe,I love the shoe but found the size ran small and narrow. That is why I gave it 3 stars. I don't normally need a wide shoe but might have in this one. Over all it is a great shoe in design and construction and I would have loved to add this to my closet.
2,The shoe is uncomfortable,The concept is great; a heeled shoe with cushioning. The cushion is comfortable but he back of the shoe dug into my heel creating horrible blisters. I guess I could have broke it in at the expense of my feet but decided to return them.
2,Too Narrow,"The shoe is beautiful and it is made with an excelent quality, but the size is extremely narrow. I have never needed a wide shoe but I might have it in this one. I can not even wear it because it is so tight that hurts. It is a shame. Unfortunately I am out of USA so the returning fee will cost me more than the shoe did."
4,I like it,I agree with other reviewers - this shoe is a bit small so order half size bigger. Its very cute though I would have liked it to be more comfy.
5,great cd,"This music is fairly obscure, but it deserves to be less so. Scarlatti's cantatas are engaging and musically demanding, and here four of them (out of some 700 that the composer wrote!) are given a top notch performance. Brandes has a beautiful voice, and she has no difficulty with this very florid and heavily ornamented style of music."
1,piece of cheap trash,Put this on my drill press and it lasted about 5 minutes using it on soft pine before the shaft spun out of it. I was able to use it by running a bolt through it and double nutting it. For this price one should not have to be rigging it. Would never buy this again
5,"So we're flogging a dead horse are we? Oh right, pig sorry!","These remixes do a damn good job of the material there is given. From noise workouts ( a la Kevin Shields and My Bloody Valentine ) to funky workouts ( DJ Q's remix of R U Still Into It ). This remix album has something for everybody. Although depending on how you view remix albums, you'll still be missing out on one of the most addictive albums there are - remix album or not!"
3,Another Remix Project from an up and coming band,"Remixing Mogwai: this album, like many other bands have done lately, turned out to be not that bad, but not that good either.The MyBloodyValentine mix of ""Fear of Satan"" (on the second CD) is grand, but other tracks have 'boring' written all over.I'll try another of their albums to get a better picture of this band."
3,Interesting but not necessary,"Remix albums always sound like a grand concept, having a bunch of disparate artists remix an artist's work and then smacking together the results on one disc. Sometimes the contrasts work well, and sometimes they can pull it off. Mogwai's remix album leaves me thinking ""sort of."" There are some nice interpretations here, such as the ones from Third Eye Foundation, Alec Empire and especially My Bloody Valentine, but a lot of the album is uninteresting and could be considered filler. None of them really capture the miserable quality of Mogwai's original music, which is why the Mogwai remix of ""Fear Satan"" is a standout."
5,Soler,"I can not get enough of this music composed by Soler. While I only enjoy harpsichord music to a point and then find it tiresome, these recordings are perfect for any listening occasion. While listening to Nos. 4,5,6, I decided to purchase this CD with 1,2,3; so glad I did. Equal to the other set (1,2,3) these pieces are not too dramatic as some SOLER music tends to be and can be enjoyed more often than just for that once in a while mood for something played on the harpsichord. I own several recordings of Soler pieces but find these Quintets (1-3, and, 4-6) the best of the recordings available."
3,Who knows?,I'd be thrilled to review this book except Ihaven't received it yet. I ordered it Apr. 22Am I being impatient?
1,Not bright enough,"I could swear when I bought this there were numerous glowing reviews at amazon....nothing listed now. Very disappointed in the strength of the light, unfortunately I fear it takes at least a 12 volt battery to actually get a lasting solar charge to light a small sign at night."
2,Book was educational to someone who don't know much about computers.,Pro: Book taught me about the necessary things I needed to build my pc.Con: The book basically told you about the products that they are selling. I don't like the fact that they limit it to those products and wanted to learn about other products that were available.
4,Salon music from 19th Century St Petersburg,"I bought this on the strength of the review in Gramophone Good CD Guide 1999 and wasn't disappointed. The music is excellent, for the genre, and Leiferkus gives a wonderful performance - the only one of these songs currently available.Playing time 63'14. Texts in romanized Russian not Cyrillic, which is a little offputting for those who read Russian but is better than nothing, which is more common with western record companies' treatment of Russian vocal music, and also translations in English, French and German."
4,Very comfortable.,This was my first pointed toe and heel of this sort and I was concerned it may not be comfortable. I was happily surprised. The shoe was very comfortable-I wore them twice on all night affairs and there were absolutely no problems with fit.
2,Look like elf shoes,This shoes are uncomfortable and make your feet look wide. They run small. They look nicer in the picture than they actually are.
4,I could be emo for a day,"With the tightly controlled emotion on their hit ""Three Cheers for Five Years,"" (download the acoustic version for a great twist to the song) Mayday Parade has hooked fans in just one listen. A great first amateur album for the band, Mayday really has a lot of drive in their songs, music, and lyrics. The variation of the melodies might be further developed (the melody in the fast songs tend to stay around the same range of notes) and listeners may accidentally mistake one song for the other. I'd like to see something departing from the loud, constant banging in their next (3rd) album, and hope the music itself of each song doesn't blur into the next track. They are a band that has truly developed its particular style; however, to push through, experimentation with new sounds must be taken on. For a first album, I feel they are more mature than most bands who are out there on their first try. Go Mayday!"
5,Now it all makes sense,"I bought this book many years ago on a whim. I have re-read it twice, purchased it for a friend who is having marriage issues and referred it to my mens group. It gives men explanations on how they think and feel and descriptions that they can use to explain to others. It is written in 'man speak' which makes it a fast read."
1,skip this one,"I bought this DVD player about a year ago. It worked ok until about a month ago when it started stuttering. I kept hitting the play button over and over again until it got over that trouble spot. It was not the DVD because I played it in my portable and the ""rough"" spot played just fine. I got this player because I heard great things about the name brand. I agree with the other reviewer that it looks cheep looking. For a player that cost me 150.00 dollars I really thought I was getting my moneys worth. Today it finally just quit playing.When I discovered it was sputtering, I cleaned the lens with a disk cleaner. That did not seem to help. I have a digital TV and that is the reason that I bought this player to begin with. Now I am stuck with buying another one. Very disappointing."
3,Loud and Clear,This unit is great in environments where noise is not a concern. Picture quality is great using component or HDMI connection. The issue I have is with noise. The whirring sound coming from the unit during playback is a little annoying during quieter movie passages and CD's.
4,Good for the price,"I purchased this unit because it had an HDMI output to match my television along with the price. It may not be the of the highest quality unit, maybe a little flimsy but it is feature laden and it performs well. It seems Toshiba is targeting second line equipment, for budget minded consumers. I purchased thier Cinema Series TV for 2005, and they cut back from the previous year on Features and Quality. I paid $129.00 for the DVD Player with all the features you could want on a DVD Player, its not going to be build like a tank."
4,good player,this dvd player looks great on my HD screen with the HDMI cable that comes with it (most do not come with). options and features are good. card reader is a great and easy way to view photos.
2,Nice to take to a musicologist's picnic,"The reviewer below explains the genesis of these fragments, all in D major, of symphonies Schubert never finished. He was cautious about his progress as a symphonist, cowed by the example of Beethoven and discouraged by the fialure to gain performances. These fragments are extremely minor, despite the fact that the last group are sketches for a Tenth Sym. They show not even a spark of genius, and the timid reconstructions by Brian Newbould don't help. Nor do the pallid, mincing performances given by Mackerras and a lackluster Scottish Chamber Orchestra. Pass, unless you are a musicologist yourself."
1,Did NOT fit as represented,"The caps did not fit the bottles on my Bemis 497-300 humidifier. They looked like they would fit but the thread size was wrong. The caps I was sent had four crenelation-gaps around the edge, whereas the ones on my unit (and the ones in the photo) only have two gaps or notches. I contacted the vendor and was told that they ""should"" fit. Ultimately I had to return these and order from another source - and those did work. The vendor did give me a full refund but I was out the cost of shipping back the misrepresented item."
3,Good but not for professionals,"This book gives little form a lot of subjects. Therefore, for quick understanding of industrial mathematics, it may be helpful. However, in most cases, problems can be solved with good unsderstanding of topics, at least theoretical level. This book may be good for beginners, but definitely not for the problem-solvers."
3,A very good backpack but unfortunatly it came broken....,"I wish I would have gotten it in good conditions, but I had to returned because came with a damage maybe caused by shipping conditions........."
4,Sweet bag,"I use this for carrying my books to class with my bball shoes and basketball. if you dont have a bball in the net'ing your books wont stay tight against your back, also there is elastic instead of a draw-string to hold the ball in the net'ing(I cut the elastic to make it easier to insert the ball). The bag holds my size 13 shoes just fine, but there is limited room for books if you have shoes and a bball in the bag."
1,Not even endorsed by Ron White,Visit his web site and even Ron White has a message that says this DVD isn't worth your money. It's 22 minutes long for pete's sake! White says Sony released this DVD without his concern or permission. Buy it only if you find it used for $5 or so.
1,Total waste of money.,I made the mistake of buying this DVD without reading the reviews. Don't make the same mistake!!! It is not even worth the time to watch it.
1,ron white? ron pale!,this is the worst performance i've ever seen. i guess this is a pilot for a tv-show that wasnt picked up. good riddance!
1,PLEASE!!!! FOR THE LOVE OF GOD DON'T BUY THIS!!!,"I found this DVD at Wal-Mart for 15 bucks and finally got around to watching it. Buying this DVD was far worse than throwing my money down the crapper!! I really hope Ron White feels ashamed of this abomination. In short, save your money or at least spend it on the quite hilarious ""You Can't Fix Stupid."" RATING: --ZERO STARS--"
1,bad,I hated the DVD so much I had to throw it away I think you need to make a new 1 Ron White show sucked
1,Totally Sucks,"This is not even worth the $7 - 21 minutes long no stand-up.Don't buy this one. Buy ""You Can't Fix Stupid"" it's a good one."
1,"Awful, Awful Trash!!","My wife happened upon this disc in the bargain bin priced at only $3 and I think it was still overpriced at that! Avoid this DVD and instead get Ron White's ""They Call Me Tater Salad"" or ""You Can't Fix Stupid""--- they're worth the money!"
5,RON WHITE SHOW.,pLEASE DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY; FOR 33 MINUTES IT IS DEFINITELY NOT WORTH THE SHIPPING CHARGES!
2,Beware misleading description!,"This is a Vocal Selections book, not the Vocal Score (as is clear from the large photo of the cover)."
1,Unhappy!,Your detail on this merchandise left a lot to be desired. These are not the complete lyrics as one would expect to receive. Even the cover is different from the one I originally ordered. I strongly disagree with you when you say that my return is not the result of your error. You should have made it clear that the book did not contain the entire song.
2,Poor Directions,"It is almost impossible for children under 10 to assemble these pieces. The included directions are very poor and do not not even display or mention some of the smallest pieces. If the children actually play with them instead of just building them, the small pieces fall apart easily. The age limit is 8 on up, but it is definitely more suited for 12 or above."
3,Megablocks will never enter my house again,Although the castle looks cool it is a piece of garbage! The pieces do not stay together - the instructions are horrible! My husband spent hours gluing the pieces together just so the kids could at least play with it. I've already warned my boys that this is the last Megablocks product we will EVER buy!
3,VERY DIFFICULT,"Although my three boys were very excited about this set when we got it, the excitment quickly wore off, the set was next to impossable to build, and when you do get it to fit together (after hours of cursing under your breath, and pitching parts against the wall), it fell apart at the slightest touch, causing tears from my seven year old. I would not recomnd it for kids under the age of at least 13 to 14."
1,what a disappointment!,"This toy won't stay together! Our family spent several hours assembling this toy, yet it falls apart every time you touch it! BAD quality, BAD workmanship, BAD TOY! Save your money, and shop for something else!"
1,dragons warriors fortress,"My nine year old received this fortress for Christmas. He is very good with Legos, an engineer in the making. He loves the idea of the castle and dragons, but the reality is disapointing. The directions are lousy, and the pieces are poorly made. The pieces do not snap together well, if at all. This experience has convinced me that Legos has the corner on this market. To bad the fortress wasn't produced by Lego. This was an expensive lesson in frustration for my son, and his dad. I suggest spending money on something better! We were very dissapointed."
1,Mega Bloks are No Good,Although the dragons theme is enticing.... the problem with this and all the sets is they are mega bloks which are a terrible rip-off of Legos. The plastic blocks just do not function and cannot keep any of the constructions together even after hours of frustration. The instructions are terrible. You would think they could somehow imitate Legos better but these are best avoided. The only worthy item is the dragon as a play figure but even these are of extremely low quality. Save your money and do not be seduced by this enticing theme set. Mega-blocks just fundamentally [disappoints].
3,Worth it if you have the patience.,"I was shocked at how cheap this was. A lego edition would have cost four times as much and not had the detail. Of course, while putting it together, I realized WHY it was so cheap. It is not for the faint of heart. Despite the fact that most of it is made up of large, prefabricated sections, you need a magnifying glass and the patience of Job to work out how to put it together. I actually ended up ignoring how to brace the bases together and jury-rigged something based on my lego experiences.That said, the knights and dragons are worth it. They're utterly beautiful and have an awfully neat gimmick involving the special stones.All in all, I don't know how well this would hold up if I was a kid, but as an adult collector building this for permanent displays, I find it wonderful."
3,Not worth the money,"After spending about an hour putting the fortress together it was very disappointing to see that it wouldn't stay together. Some of the pieces seemed to fit poorly and Rockscourcher the Blue Dragon was missing it's front claws. I feel this toy is a parent's worst nightmare. I am constantly having to help my son put the pieces back together even with normal use. He normally doesn't have a hard time putting these things together. I am still waiting for Megabloks to address the missing claws to the dragon with very little luck. On a positive note the only thing this toy is good for is it does encourage hours of imaginative play, but there are also a lot of other better quality toys out there that do the same thing for much less money."
1,"Brilliant idea, lousy execution","This LOOKS like a great toy but it's horribly designed. The bricks are inferior in quality to Legos and they won't stay together so the base and towers are useless. That wouldn't be so bad if the dragons worked -- they look so cool they'd be fun to play with on their own, even without the towers. But the day after we got this their lights failed to light and one dragon's tail snapped off (in a place it wasn't supposed to come apart)and it hasn't been played with since. I wish I could get our money back! Don't ""spend"" your money on this ... set; don't be fooled by how marvelous the dragons look on the package!"
2,Not worth the trouble,"The Mega Bloks Dragons Warriors Fortress set may be impossible to assemble. After spending several frustrating hours with my son, we've given up hope of the castle ever working as we had hoped. The dragons and people are cool, but it isn't worth the whole set. We've contacted Mega Bloks to see what they might do for us. We hope they'll offer us dragons or people - they can have the castle back or we'll throw it away!"
2,Mega Bloks Dragon Set,"My son received 3 of the Dragon sets for Christmas. We eagerly opened the boxes hoping to assemble the sets and play for hours. Instead, we were completely frustrated with pieces not snapping securely in place. In addition, the illustrated instructions did not clearly explain which pieces to assemble. I have purchased Mega Bloks sets in the past such as race cars, helicopters, etc. They have been fun to assemble for my son and hold together well so I was really surprised with these sets. In the future, I'll probably stick to Lego's for larger sets."
5,i have more energy,this product was also recommended by my nutritionist. i had miscarried earlier this year and since have been trying to concieve. i was told this is one of the best pre-natal vitamins and am now trying it. i feel good and hope i will concieve soon.
1,What a waste of money,"Cannot believe schools make people buy this book. Old, outdated and useless. All info and then some is available online any time and up to date."
4,A good Resource for planting ANNUALS,"I must admit - I do not love annuals- Having said that much to preface my comments- For me this is the only book I need on this subject! It covers planning, planting and maintenence.The planning section seems especially helpful and will be a tremendous help in achieving a finished product that fits a desired look. The color planning seems very well addressed with particular attention the area to be planted in formulation the design elements (suggested on graph paper).The writer seems to love annuals and it shows! The photography is beautiful. This would make a nice housewarming gift!"
1,EWWWWWWW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!IT`S A JUNK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I will give this doll 1 star.Look at her face.She is ugly.I will never get this doll.
3,Making use of resources,"Having seen no other production of the play, I thought it was a pretty good movie. However, I had no basis for comparison. I did expect the sisters to be younger, closer to Cordelia in age, but their old-hag look did help to portray their wickedness. Edmund was very well portrayed. Edgar, however, seemed a bit too frail to be the avenging bother. Lear was portrayed quite well I thought, but he could've been taller. He struck me as a little ball of fury. The fool was easily my favorite character, and played his role well. You could tell by the settings that this was a low-budget production, but they helped to divert the attention to the action, as did the plain costumes. Overall, I enjoyed it and thought it was worth watching."
2,Uggh!,"This production can be summed up in one word: cheap. The sets were cheap, the costumes were cheap, and the acting was cheap. The setting was so overly simple as to cause distraction. It looked like someone had spilled a can of Tara Cota red paint all over everything. The costumes were no better. Some looked like they were just buttoned up robes while others looked straight out of Star Wars. All of the actors were so melodramatic that one could not focus on the lines, and some close-ups were so close it was disturbing. Overall, I did not enjoy the production."
3,A Decent Production,"It was a decent production with good acting but was obviously budget judging from the boring stage and costume. The acting was decent despite several yelling and mumbling problems and King Lear seemed crazy long before the play called for it. It had decent acting and if you're familiar with the play keeping up won't be a problem. Otherwise, go read it."
2,Inaccurate Data in this production.,"The BBC production of king Lear was a good portal of Shakespeare's original except that historically inaccurate throughout the production and the lack of good actors took away from the production itself. However, I will say that David Burke as Kent and Timothy West as Gloucester fit there roles well as well as done very good acting in this production, even though surrounded be some horrible acting. Sometimes the actors couldn't be understood because they were so focused on mumblings and screaming. Then the inaccurate data such as the rubber tires on the cart, Gloucester's filling in his teeth, and the Fool's custom which was not of the period. Therefore, I didn't like this production because I myself couldn't ignore the inaccurate data, and the bad acting however the storyline itself is a good one."
2,King Lear Review,I really liked the actress who played Cordellia. She brouhgt that sense of innocence that i pictured her having. She played the emotions really well. I did not like the actors performance of King Lear. He made King Lear seem a lot more crazy then he really was. The actor playing Edmund i thought played him well.
4,Ion Holm's Great,King Lear is a difficult part because of the old age of Lear. The energy that Ion Holm put into this part is outstanding. Great preformances in all of the cast.
2,King Lear Meets Star Wars,"The casting director should have spared us the bow to diversity and political correctness when a hispanic was cast as France and a negro as Burgundy. Set design and costume sacrificed tradition and historical representation to economy and off-beat originality. The costumes resemble those of Star Wars. The Fool, instead of being youthful, agile and entertaining, is fat, old and dumpy. The most entertaining thing about the fool is Lear referring to the grizzled 70 year-old as ""boy"". Holms as Lear can't hold a candle to Lawrence Oliver. Holms plays every scene with the same, monotonous, high level of intensity, like a manic Lear. He is unable to play Lear as a likeable, sympathetic character, in any scene. During the scene in which Lear's heart is supposed to break when Cordelia fails to declare her love with sufficient eloquence, Holms' Lear only comes accross as manic, obsessed and neurotic. Even with its poor film quality, Sir Lawrence Oliver's production is the best."
2,King Lear Review,"The movie was somewhat lackluster. The production was highly lacking, leaving the audience wondering what the heck was going on. The only settings were a red room with sometimes different furniture, a hall, and the outside during a storm. For example on teh acting confusion, one scene showed lear at his castle with his knights and the next was with him at his daughters casstle. I do believe the actual stage production may have been the best and most clear, and this, if not all, remakes should be laid to rest with Shakespeare."
2,A film that would have made it to the Goodwill screens but not Hollywood.,"I didn't really like this film, but I guess it got the point across. I was surprised as to how well the actors played the parts, and how well they remembered the Shakesperean lines. The setting however way to cheap and would have never made it to Hollywood, but it would have made it to the producers of the Goodwill films. There was way to much screaming in the play which made it hard for me to stay focused on. I found Victoria Hamlet, or Codelia, to be less prettier than her sisters, which was ironic. Edgar was not aggressive enough with Edmund, which made him look like a big queer. So if you haven't watched it don't waste your time."
3,King Lear,"While keeping in close proximity to the original Shakespeare play ""King Lear,"" Richard Eyre seems to fall short of capturing the audience, due to his choice of cast. Ian Holm made it difficult for the viewer to witness the transformation in which Lear was supposed to make because of his periodic overacting. Holm was either trying too hard or not trying enough to capture Lear's emotion. This inconsistency left much to be desired. However, Flynn and Redman (Goneril and Regan) captured the wickedness of Lear's two oldest daughters quite well. All of the emotions one might assume the two would have after reading the original play were present and carried out believably, unlike the role of Edgar who came across as far too petty and niave. While the main ideas were relayed and understood, the acting was overproduced and left the viewer unconvinced and disappointed."
2,Not So Hot,"This movie did not attract my attention as much as I thought it would. The movie didn't have good stage setting, acting, dressing, and actors to fit the description of the people in the play. The movie lost my attention at the beginning when it showed how slack the movie set-up was. Next time they make a King Lear movie they need to fix all of the things above so that I won't fall asleep in the middle of class."
2,Shakespeare in space,"When I first learned that I would be watching King Lear in my English class I was greatly over-joyed. Firstly because we never get to watch videos in class, and secondly because I was curious to visually see the play. However, upon watching the first minutes of the play I felt like watching the movie was more like punishment than pleasure. The costumes made the characters look like they were on spaceship flying towards another planet. The simple sets didn't fit the extravagant lifstyle I thought a King would lead. The actors, though they were talented, did not fit what I visualized the characters to look like. I must say that with the simple costumes and sets it did help me focus on the dialogue of the play. Visually seeing the dialogue come to life gave me a better understanding of the play. I would not recommend this video for entertainment but for learning purposes only."
2,Shake 'n' Bake,The play was well done by Ian Holm. Their were a few inconsistencies such as:Though they were played very well Goneril and Regan seem a bit old for their respective parts. Barbara Flynn seemed old enough to be Lear's wife and Regan seems to grab the attention away from the other sisters since she is a blonde. The clothing was out of date and other discrepancies such as LAND MINES!?!
2,Handicap Version of King Lear,"Holm does a fine job portraying ""King Lear."" I do believe that it would be a very hard part to portray. As I have only seen this production of ""King Lear"" I do not believe this would be the very best possible production(at least I hope not). The movie contained to much screaming, too much mumbling and not enough clear tone to comprehend. The set was obviously low budget and did not take much time to set up and film. Overall I probably would not like to see this production again."
2,King Lear Video-Regretful Experience,"From the appearance of this movie I can conclude that this is a first time experience for the director and most of the actors. The acting was either too much to stand or not enough to be able to understand. The actor that played King Lear was overplaying being insane. Edgar was very overdone. He was too much into his own world to make the audience understand his character. But I did like the performance of Goneril and Regan. I thought they were quite eviland exactly like i pictured. I did picture Cordelia to be prettier and not so ""Thriller"" like. As far as set design I thought it was incredibly poorly done. Costumes didn't seem realistic to the time period the play was supposed to take place in. Overall I thought it was i poor performance and a waste of time."
2,No Nuance,This is a production totally without nuance and its owes that to the bellowing of Ian Holm. Holm as Lear bellows at the beginning. he bellows in the middle. And he belows at the end. Lear bellows when he is dividing teh kingdom. he bellows then he rejects Cordelia. he bellows when he realises that he has been betrayed by Goneriel and Regan. The character presented as Lear is entirely one dimensional. Any change of circumstance or emotion is presented as more bellowing. There is no tragedy in this production because there is no change in Lear from beginning to end.This DVD is not worth buying.
4,Delightful!,"I don't usually like most flavored teas, except for Earl Grey. I'll drink a mint tea only if it's real mint. So I was skeptical. But I tasted this at my daughter's house and it was delightful. Fresh, very peachy, no chemical aftertaste. Highly recommended. Also makes a lovely iced tea for us who, despite the sacrilege, must have some, sweet, on the hot sultry days of a southern summer."
4,Wonderful Tea,"I absolutely love this tea. It's smooth, it's very aromatic, and is just wonderful for a relaxing morning. The seller didn't have this particular item in stock and missed the delivery date by a few weeks. I wrote and complained. They sent me 5 of the tag-a-long round tins with 5 sachets in each of this tea. They were very nice and refunded all of the money. I would buy from this seller again because the tea is just perfect, but I probably wouldn't order something so close to a holiday/for a holiday."
2,mixed feelings,"They shipped 6 business days (8 real days) after my order. And the arrival date exceeded Amazon's max. estimate by 3 business days. It seems from their feedback page that they have been late many times but ppl are happy about the quality of tea. I can understand that, but I guess the online stores I've been using are just too good.Also it doesn't say anywhere on the product whether the flavor is natural or artificial."
3,"Nice looking and functional, but cheaply constructed.","This is one of the nicer looking bamboo fountains I've seen. Bought it last year and this spring, when I got ready to start it back up, the reservoir had a crack in it about an inch long allowing water to leak out through the bottom. The crack occurred next to a fitting inside. I used bathroom silicon caulk to repair the crack and hope that it holds when it cures. It's worth a try and if this doesn't work, I search the hardware store for something to patch plastic. No reason for this item to be so cheaply made; made in China for pennies and sold for $59.95. What a deal! I have another bamboo fountain (same price) and much nicer bought at Big Lots (made in China), that survived the winter and works very well. If this comes back on the market, buy with caution or go check out Big Lots."
5,The very best of Kitty Cradle,"This is a sweet and very nice Kitty cradle, it fits to all of the cats favorite places, the kitchen table or in some of the living-room chairs or in the sleeping-room bed it does not matter where it are placed the cat will be sleeping within. The cats just adores this warm and cosy cradle it are the very best."
3,"A sonic spectacular, but...","Respighi's ""Roman Trilogy"" has been the basis of ""demonstration-quality"" recording jobs since the days of LP. Here's another--it'll make even the hairs on the back of the hairs on the back of your neck stand on end. However, I'm less enthralled by the performance, which, for all the supposedly ""authentic"" atmosphere provided by an Italian conductor and Roman orchestra, is pretty slack."
5,Saved by Amazon,Am very happy with the product I purchased and the way in which the entire transaction was handled.Saved me hundreds of dollars on blth the purchase and the installation.Thank you Amazon.
1,Fizi:k ICS Seat Bag Medium,"I have four road bikes all with Fizi:k saddles and ICS Seat Bags. When I bought and mounted my first ICS Seat Bag I questioned how sturdy the plastic hinge was and how well would they hold up. Well after just over a 2 years I only have one out of the four that so far has not broken. Three have broken in the exact same place. They have all broken on the right hand side, looking from the rear of the bag, just at the interface below the hinge connection. Would not recommend this product until they redesign the plastic hinge area."
3,Nice but small,"Looks great under my saddle. Looks much cleaner then traditional saddle bags. Smaller then I expected, I don't know how the other reviewer fit everything stated in this bag. A tube alone is taking up 35%. I would hate to see the small size bag. I love the way it looks, but doubt I will be keeping it due to the small size."
1,Bag Be Gone,"This bag was OK for a while, but then the rivets that hold the clip to the bag started to separate from the fabric. It's just not designed to hold the weight of a full bag. Don't buy it, unless you want to lose your stuff."
2,Medium is the new tiny,"Man is this small. My wife's current saddle bag is small and she rides a fizik saddle. This looked like a wonderful idea for a replacement. Problem is that the medium bag is small, small, small. You can carry a spare tube, a CO2 tube and valve, a couple of nesting tire tools and NOT MUCH ELSE. I can only guess what the small size is like. I really want it to work, 'cause I like the idea of easily popping the bag off the bike when traveling, but it's just too small."
1,"Great concept, terrible execution","I love the concept of this bag. I ride three bikes regularly and they all have ICS compatible saddles. The problem is that the plastic clip is too weak to hold a fully loaded repair bag. That is 2 tubes, CO2 inflator and tool kit. I loved the modularity, a non-thigh rubbing due to no strap on seatpost, but I have now lost two of these and all the gear in them.DON'T BUY THIS!!!"
2,Can't recommend this!,Sorry but had to JB Weld the plastic hinge to keep it from sagging. It's not very aero when it sags.
4,Fizik IC saddle bag,"For a medium sized bag, I think its a little on the small side. If you need to carry more than a tube, patches, 2 co cartridges, multi tool and some band-aids look elsewhere. People have complained that the clip would break and they would find at the end of the ride that they would be bag less. The L-shaped clip is mounted to a riveted base. I slid a velcro strip under the base and loop it over the rails. This still allows you to disconnect the bag quickly from the seat, and gives you extra piece of mind that should you need your stuff it'll be there."
2,Very small or did I receive the small bag?,"I ordered the medium version of this saddle bag and have to agree with others complaining about the very small size of this bag. The ICS clip is very nice but the bag just fits a tube and levers. I can not fit anything else in here. Could it be that the small version was shipped instead? On a recent ride I saw another rider that had a Fizik saddle bag with ICS clip. The bag was significantly bigger than mine. The label on the carton of mine showed medium. Which dimensions should a medium sized bag have? I could not find size information on Fizik's web site.I saw the bags later in a store and found out that I actually received the small bag labeled as medium bag. The medium bag is just perfect for me but it is concerning that it was mislabeled. Unfortunately, I found out about the mislabeling after the possibility to return the bag was already expired."
2,Let down,Concept is great and the size was right but the screw that is used to lock in a position was stripped out of the box. So it is pretty much useless.
4,Fizik Bag,"The bag is a perfect size for a tube, two cO2's, and a small patch kit. Other than those items, you wont fit anything else in. I got the small bag and really like it. I would buy this product again."
5,Adobe Photoshop CS2 HOT,Absolutely the most informative book I've ever seen written on software education. Hands on Training plus the DVD movies leads you through each and every project. I can't praise it enough.
4,I'm all about practice,"I like reading, but still I have a hard time with textbooks, learning from examples like this book is so much easier and interactive. If you want a very detailed book...you won't get that much detail; if you want to learn basics and a little bit more this is just perfect. I like this book."
2,It's ok,Magnets inside are fun to play with on scene inside of tin. After about 10 minutes the game is no longer fun.
1,Not that great!,I don't understand all the 5 star reviews on this stuff when it really isn't that good. There are a lot of better jerky's out there. I would return this stuff if I could. It is tough as shoe leather and taste like a sweat sock.
4,Tasty but tough,"I really like the taste, but it's just a little tough compared to the other jerky out there. I may buy it again, but I am not too sure."
4,Not what I was expecting ....,When it arrived and I saw the package I thought it was going to be a waste of money. However looks can be wrong. Opening the package it had a nice taste and was not to tuff. I would recommend it but to sure if I will reorder any.
1,Buyer beware - The CD is missing,"According to both the book itself and the description in the Amazon site, this book comes with, a CD-ROM packed with valuable weight loss tools, including a customizable weight-loss journal; the food group pyramid shopping list; a behavior/food calendar; a daily exercise chart; a menu planning guide; and more"", but the books that Amazon has in stock (at least the two they shipped to me) do not have the CD.I have called Amazon and asked them to correct this but their agents did not take my complaint seriously. They offered me to give me my money back but they did not want to give me the complete book with CD as advertised or to investigate why the CDs are missing."
5,"Part 2 of two part collection, and it's better!","It would be hard to top part 1 of ""Dance 2000"" so it takes someone of the calibre of Larry Heard to do it.This album is much less 4-4 beat orientated and focuses more on Larry's love of incorporating Jazz rhythms into his deep house groove.It starts off smoothly and takes you on a journey through deep, deep soundscapes where you'll never wander off as the music always draws you back in.If you've got part 1, then you'd better get this. It's better and you can complete your collection. if you like Deep House but you're not aware of Mr. Heard's work, then where have you been? He's basically the master so you'll be guaranteed masterclass in deep house when you buy this album. He puts everyone else to shame!"
3,Smaller than I thought,"This item is smaller than I thought it would be. I got it with the intention of getting rid of my old metal one, but now I'm not sure I will. I have to wait and see if it will work for draining enough pasta for a dinner."
4,Perfect for small fruit & berried,"I bought this colander for berries (blueberries, blackberries, and raspberries). Perfect size and I like how its expandable to different sizes too. Not sure how long this will hold up after several times in the dishwasher, but we'll see."
4,Not as big as i thought...,"Its much smaller than i had imagined it to be, its about six inches at its widest point... otehr than that, its a very neat device, and space saving at that... If you want a small colander for stuff like eggs, small fruit, grapes, strawberries, and things like that this is a great product, but don't expect to fit much in it...good for what it is..."
5,"""Golden"" ideas that...","remain cherished even today from my past. This is one of the essential ""guides"" that thoughtfully and gently assist anyone in their quest to know and understand themselves, the impact of the decisions they make, and the influences of thier culture that inhibits their exploration. While ""The Warriors Way"" is a bit dry and more about his life history, it makes a good companion to ""The Master Game"" in that it shows how he lived out his ""Master Plan"" in his life. Nothing like examples to light the way ! Buy it, read it, and pass it on to someone you value !!"
4,Another good Powell mystery,"Richard Powell wrote probably a dozen mystery novels in the 40's and 50's. This one is no relation to the Pink Panther movie of the same name. Like all Powell's mysteries, it's extremely well written. His characterization's are excellent. Although not as detailed or as plot driven as the later books he wrote in the 60's and 70's, these early mysteries are still very good. Powell was a newspaperman in the Philadelphia area in the 30's and 40's, and later a creative writing teacher at Syracuse University."
5,THE FIRST TIME AUTHOR HAS AN EXCELLENT IMAGINATION.,I FIRST READ IF EYES ONLY KNEW LAST WINTER. I ENJOYED IT VERY MUCH. IT REALLY TOLD TRUE LIFE SITUATIONS. WHO WOULD THOUGHT ALL THE GOOD THINGS COME TO AN END. IT'S SIMPLY KARMA WHAT GOES AROUND COMES AROUND BUT TWICE THE PAIN AND HARDSHIP!! KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK !! ALSO READ THE SEQUEL GRIMEY!! OF THE HOOK!!!
3,Hy isn't this movie available on Blu-Ray yet,I liked the high def transfer/but I'm very disapointed.That Universal picyures put this wonderfull film on amazon instant video.In Hight def no less.And only offers the lameo 133 aspect ratio full scree version.FOUL.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,Great Movie,"This is one of the best movies that I have ever seen. It has everything that a good movie should.It has a wise-cracking lovable street hustler. Then, there is the naive yet brilliant, strong hero-type. Next, bring together two vulnerable-yet hot girlfriends that bring flavor to the plot . Add to the mix a touching long-lost family reunion with a traveling adventure.Finally, you have a rags-to-riches story where the bad guys lose and the good guys (the lead characters) win. This is why themovie was a hit worldwide and I think there should have been a sequel"
4,Talk About A Recipe For Mussels And Shrimp....,"Vincent Benedict {Danny Devito} has no idea whatsoever that Julius {Arnold Schwartenegger} is his fracternal twin, separated at birth. When Julius first finds out, he is very excited and he thinks his brother will ""be just like him,"" to quote. IXNAY! Of course, Vincent does not believe him until Julius saves his life from a fight. Since they've met each other, they decide that they both need to find their mother, only they find out more about themselves other than that to begin with. That's not the only issue, but a hitman is after Vincent. Tell me, what ARE the actual odds of having 2 siblings being the exact opposite in size?"
4,An Odd Couple for sure,"Twins is one of those movies you're either going to like or not, but in any event, it's one of those ""one of a kind"" movies which shows the versatility of Devito and Arnie, and in this movie, you actually grow to like them both, especially after you learn about their outrageous beginnings, and begin to understand their respective environments which lead to their adulthood. I didn't buy the whole thing, but it was a good movie anyway."
2,Could have been great,You have to wonder what is going on in the minds of some of these Hollywood directors these days. The script is hilarious and the film company could have had a classic on their hands save for one fairly major quibble - the casting! Who in their right minds would believe that Arnold Schwartzenegger and Danny De Vito were twins. Apart from the lack of any physical resemblance they don't even have the same accent or dress the same most of the time. I have to admit it did rather detract from the film as far as I was concerned. I think they should have gone for the obvious choice and cast The Proclaimers instead.
4,Twins of Comedy,"Sxharzenegger and DeVito have great chemistry in this movie. It is funny and touching. The fun part of the plot is punctuated by a completely dissimilar appearance of the supposed twins, DeVito and Schwarzenegger. They go through some funny and rough adventures to rediscover the meaning of family.Schwarzenegger is his own tough yet sensitive self, while DeVito exploits his appearacne to his advantage. This is a great comedy."
4,Great Fun,This was a fun movie to watch. Arnold was sweet and yet his usual forceful self when needed. And Danny was funny in his caustic way.
5,arnold shows his range here,"When I first saw this film, I did not like it, but somthing told me to watch it again, & the second time around I loved it, and have ever since, once you get past the shallow back story, this film will entertain you, it is without a doubt a film the whole family could enjoy. Arnold tried to do somthing different here and did & Danny DeVito reminds you why he is so fuuny & serious at the same time, a fun film for those who don't take it so seriously, my only complaint about this DVD is the Full Frame version, Universal should reconsider rereleasing a widescreen version, they have with their other films that came out at about the same time, why not this one? hopefully they will someday."
3,Pretty Decent Movie,"Twins is a pretty decent and enjoyable movie. That fact that Danny and Arnie could actually be brothers is pretty fuuny. The acting could be better....alot better. But what can you expect it's Arnold Schwarzenegger? The man will get an audience just because of his muscles. Talking about that there's a scene where Arnold rips a shirt cause his bicep is to big. Completely rididcouls, a poor reason for him to show off his arms. Other than that it's a good movie."
3,Does not deserve the one star review,"interesting workout with good choreography. Not boring like so many. I would prefer [as with all videos] that they leave the instructional portion in a seperate chapter on the disc and just get on with the workout. After you've done it 10 times it is very annoying to listen to the instructions evey time. It is almost like the video is a lead up to the actual class, which is not on the DVD, but this is true of so many similar videos."
1,Disappointed in Manufacturing,"I was very disappointed in the manufacturing of this item. Not only where the holes not fully punched through (which the manf readily admits on their website), but the slide would not properly attach to the swing set even though holes were available, and the tandem swing was rickety and unsafe. We returned it for a refund. Some may believe it was b/c of user error, but I am competent in building items and never have I been more frustrated in assembling this swingset."
5,Rollercoaster romance that will leave you satisfied and still wanting more,"This is the sequel to the terrific 'Incommunicado', however there is enough back story included that it is not required to read it first - but I highly recommend you do as that too is a great story.Your heart just breaks for the terrible things that have occurred in the lives of Cara and Jake. So many twists and turns occur that I didn't know how the book would end. Would Cara and Jake reunite? Would they be able to overcome all the miscommunication? Would Cara isolate herself forever. Would Cara find love with her former love Maggie. Would Jake find happiness with someone new?Among all this angst there is corruption and illegal drugs and attempted murder set against a back drop of a gorgeous winery."
3,Good idea/Bad idea,"This book sounded perfect, so easy and low fat besides, but when I studied the recipes I found a whole lot of salt!! This is a very unhealthy way to go. Too much sodium is a sneaky death threat. There has to be a way to correct that problem in a future four ingredient cookbook."
4,"Great essays, questionable choices","I liked the essays he writes, and the book is certainly to be valued. But... I have some serious disagreements with his choices (admittedly to be expected to some degree). To sum it up, too British and too depressing. I am not a fan of post-Holocaust novels, and he dishes them out in droves.I will agree with other reviewers that there are some gems in here that I would have not read otherwise (Alfred Bester, Cordwainer Smith, Ian Watson, Russel Hoban), but there are some nasty ones as well.For a bit more mainstream choices, I recommend finding those novels which won both the Hugo and the Nebula. You'll even find 5 of the 17 on Pringle's list."
2,Pringle's Picks,"I wish this book had been titled, Science Fiction: MY favorite 100 novels. I can see what authors Mr. Pringle likes (Dick, Heinlein, Moorcock, to name a few) and what his taste in sci-fi is and can even probably determine his age, but objectively speaking (if I am in fact, being objective) I think a lot of novels that should have been in the top 100 were left off off his list. Of course we all have our opinions of what the best science fiction is, and if you like science fiction that usually means you love it and therefore probably have strong opinions, so if you find you share his tastes then this is the 100 for you.I did get a few suggestions from it so it was somewhat helpful."
3,"Just average, nothing special being offered here...","This disc of analog to digital dates back to 1988. Since then the remastering process has made great strides. The Radio Luxemboug Symphony conducted by Louis de Froment gives us a lukewarm program of light classics. Though competently played and recorded there are far better renditions by the superstars(Karajan, Bernstein, Solti, etc.) in the field; and for about the same price. The selections do kind of convey a concert in the park feel as envisioned by their creater Sir Henry Wood. However, Arthur Fiedler and the Boston Pops among others do it so much better! Shop around a little for something else or buy it only at a low price. Liner notes are included. The selections are listed below:1) Elgar: Pomp and Circumstance March #12) Liszt: Les Preludes3) Khatchaturian: Sabre Dance4) J Strauss: Over. from ""Die Fledermaus""5) Dukas: The Sorceror's Apprentice6) Gluck: Ballet music, from ""Orpheus"""
4,Interesting progressive rock,"Mastermind began as a fusion outfit, playing primarily instrumental music, but on this CD, they brought in new vocalist Lisa Bouchelle, and adopted a more song-oriented format. The songs remain fairly long, and contain extended instrumental sections, but these are now built around vocal melodies. The vocals are very professional, with an almost classical feel in places. The metal-tinged guitar riffs complement the singer nicely. The instrumental sections favor fluid solos, and the keyboards provide a good backgrop for the guitar. The result is music that is consistently interesting, and quite pleasant to listen to. This CD deserves more recognition than it has received up to now."
4,the best is yet to come,"I must say that after reading the other reviews that i thought maybe I had done the wrong thing in ordering this CD but now after listening to it many times I`m sure its very good. The new female singer Lisa Bouchelle is an exciting extra to Mastermindshe brings out a greater sense of melody . The guys are sounding fresh and the songs on this CD are also well written and musicaly outstanding with Bill Berends, Rich Berends and Jens Johansson these guys sound fantastic together. The version they do of ELP`s (The Endless Enigma)will make most prog heads drool. I don`t know what it is that some of the other reviewers hear (that they don`t like) but what ever it is I can`t hear it.Well done Mastermind a very good CD, I feel the best is yet to come."
2,"Good instrumentals, cheap vocals","""Excelsior"" by Bill Berends & Co. was a great instrumental album. On their 2000 CD release, Bill surprises us with female vocals (Lisa Bouchelle) - he really shouldn't have done that. Obviously, Bill isn't skilled enough to write good vocal parts. Hence, this album is great in its instrumental-only parts, but sounds like a cheap middle-of-the-road-wannabe-metal-band-with-female-singer otherwise. And was this ""Endless Enigma"" thing really necessary?!? I mean, this is one of ELP's best songs, and it's hard to top their own version. Now Bill comes up with a badly arranged cover version, with a female voice that sounds absolutely misplaced on this track... One more unneccessary rehash of a great classic prog composition. Two stars for the few instrumental parts that are great, as usual. Hopefully the next album will be an instrumental one. Hands off from vocals, Bill!"
5,Its better than Dragon Slayer,"I on Man-o-War, Dragon gate, and Dragon Slayer and I just added five boxes of little men to my collection. THIS TOY IS CHEAP AND IT RULES!!! Well the only problem was the pieces a little on the bad side but everything else is cool! Like the Awsome dragon."
3,Review,"This set is fun, but the peices don't fit together well. The dragons are really cool despite the fact that everything else stinks. I wish that they would just sell the dragons individually. The people are O.K. too, but not as good as Legos. This set (and all the others) in my opinion are worth ten cents, and thats about it. I'd recommend the smaller cheaper ones like the Dragon Slayer and Battle gate more than more expensive ones where you get all these dumb not working blocks."
3,wonder women infinete crisis ser 2,this one looks googd in the pic but when you get it you start to see difernt. for 1 the cape is not cloth and to me it looked it. and in the pic she has a nice stans. they are not using the stand if they did she would look like she were falling to the right.and as for the stand its self you have to put the peg in and trust it is hard to do. So there beter wonder women figures out there. dont waste mony on this one.
1,"If you want to watch the whole movie, don't buy this DVD player!","Had it for 2 weeks. Every movie we watched either froze or paused or skipped. If it freezes up, you have to pull the plug and start over. Really surprised - Toshiba is supposed to be so good. We're taking it back to Best Buy right now! I paid 55$. It's on sale today for 29$. It's not worth 29$. By the way... it's hooked up to my new Toshiba 42"" plasma TV that we just bought. Hope this isn't a sign of things to come..."
1,zero stars. don't buy.,bought this at best buy; disappointed that both best buy and amazon continue to sell what is obviously junk. slight praise for amazon for letting consumers who've already been ripped off complain about it after the fact.
1,"Add me to the list of ""bAd"" DVD owners","I got this unit in Nov 2005. It was small and light and functioned without any complaints for 6 months and then died entirely. ""Incorrect Disc"" on the screen and ""bAd"" on the LED display. Outside the warranty period, but I'm going to call Toshiba tomorrow and talk nice to them. Clearly this unit is defective."
1,Broke quickly,Bought it on black friday at best buy. Used it about 10 times before it broke. Don't buy it!
4,Easy to use and well made,This is a great DVD player for the price! We brought this for a family member last year and they love it. They use it often and have never had any trouble with it.
1,JUNK!!!,This player is junk. It broke in less than one year. Only has a 90-day warranty. Buy anything but this!
1,"Broke One, Broke Two, Trying a Sammy Now","Purchased one of these in November '05. It lasted until December '05 (60 days). Took it back and exchanged it for another one. The replacement lasted until Feb '06 (60 days). Wasn't using it a whole lot either, so definately not overplayed.I have a very old second gen Toshiba which still works. My how Toshiba's quality has nose dived. Now giving the Samsung a try and see how it goes.Just to clarify. Do not buy this player. It is JUNK!"
1,One Erratic Little Machine,"I bought this dvd player after extensive net research.The unit worked fine for a couple of weeks, then went on the fritz - no matter what dvd I put into the player, the display read ""bad.""So, I carried it over to an authorized service center, only to discover that the unit is a ""return only,"" and cannot be serviced.So, I prepared to send it back. The seller warned me that if the unit was not found to be defective on arrival, I would be charged a restocking fee of $30 plus return shipping charges. Well, the restock fee plus round trip shipping is almost the cost of the unit.So, I plugged it again to make sure that it still was not working.Lo and behold, it started working again.I was thrilled - for about three weeks - until it went on the fritz again.Maybe I just got a lemon, which sometimes happens, but be fore-warned!If this happens to you, the return process could be more costly than replacing with another unit."
1,"Lasted 84 days & 5-6 uses, now broken!","I didnt look at any reviews on this either, got this on black friday and now its a paper weight. Was watching about the 5th movie ive rented and at the end it made a noise and the picture froze. Now every disc that i try to play they all say BAD and thats it. Not veru happy with toshiba on this one. I was thinking about getting a toshiba tv but will now avoid this company!"
2,Poor picture quality,"I set out to replace another Toshiba DVD/VHS player which had worked for less than a year before it started freezing up as some other reviewers have described for this unit. However, I had not read the reviews on Amazon (big mistake), and bought another Toshiba, the SD-3980, attracted by its incredibly low price of $44 at a wholesale store. This turned out to be a mistake, since the picture quality was significantly worse than my previous Toshiba DVD player, which I tested by playing the same disks. Since I was also worried this unit would freeze up like my other Toshiba, I returned it and will spend a few extra bucks for a more reliable brand."
1,JUNK!!!,I can see that most people who bought this junk had the same problem. I opened mine up to determine the problem. I am an experienced tech. I was able to come to the conclusion that the motor that spins the disc wears out quickly. It does not bring the disc up to the proper speed.
2,Toshiba...where has the quality gone??,"I purchased this player back in 2005 because it seemed to be a great choice for a compact economical DVD player. Well, it started displaying bizarre symptoms in Jan of 2006, Pixel problems, lock ups, motor noise..etc. I have owned 2 toshiba players in the past and the quality was top-notch. This player is a piece of junk. I called Toshiba to see what they will do for me?Stay away!!"
1,The WORST dvd player ever... Very bAD,"I had two of these dvd players... 1st one started erroring out with ""bAD"" showing on the display after about a month. My second unit errored out (bAD) after 3 days. I had previously had very good luck with toshiba, so I have no clue what they did with this machine."
1,F U Toshiba!!!!,"The question to ask yourself before purchasing this DVD player is this: Am I prepared to be humiliated in front of family/friends/dates when this brand-new player suddenly freezes or breaks down in the middle of a movie for no apparent reason, without the possibility of repair?I definitely wasn't prepared, which is why it's too bad that I didn't read the extremely insightful reviewers' comments on this page before I bought this abysmal, miserable, horrid player. Fewer than 10 DVDs played and it's already completely dead. I'll never go near a Toshiba product again...if you're thinking of buying this machine, definitely take the advice of the rest of the reviewers here, and just pretend that you never even laid eyes on this awful product!!!"
1,Breaks,"Like many other reviews here report, my SD-3980 lasted less than four months before breaking. It now refuses to play anything. Waste of money."
1,Tohiba STINKS!,"Ok, word to the wise. If you see Toshiba on the Box, put it down. Better yet, throw it down and run away.I have had nothing but terrible experiences with the Toshiba Brand! Nothink but junk. You might have more fun playing roullet, or scratch tickets. Your odds of winning are higher!!!!I have had a Toshiba Laptop completely break, a Toshiba hard drive fry, and my mom bought me thid DVD player and I thought.....well, TOshiba couldn't suck that bad???? WELL THEY DO!!! The damn thing didn't break, just never worked. Unless you plan on playing pristine DVD's that haven't touched air, don't buy this. Countless playback problems with movies. Countless nights of watching a movie, just to have it turn to garbled blocks RIGHT AT THE GOOD PART!!!!!! Don't buy this DVD player and join with me in an all out Toshiba Boycott"
4,DVD REview,Had my SD-3980 for over one year and use daily-works beautifuly-also bought one for my daughter
1,User-hostile.,"I'd give it zero stars, if I could. Stay well away. It's a flawed design. The tray itself was skimped on -- it's got about half the lip of a normal DVD tray, the tolerances are all bad -- it's the single worst piece of consumer equipment I've ever seen.I had to jiggle the tray to get a test DVD in it, then turn it over and physically shake it to get the DVD out.I have been pleased with Toshiba players in the past, so the lack of quality in this one completely blindsided me."
1,Because I can't give it zero stars,All the reviews are correct. It's junk.That's the last time I buy anything without reading the Amazon reviews first.
1,Junk...Period,"I'm a loyal Toshiba fan, having purchased several Toshiba televisions that have worked flawless for years. I bought this as a companion to my bedroom set. Tested out a brand new unit with my favorite movie, and it played only 30 second and froze, permanently. Tried to get other disks to play, but would only say ""loading"", only to eventually say ""wrong disk"". Absolutely worthless..."
1,2 month DVD,I bought it two months ago. It is completly dead now. I can't load any DVD at all. I watch just a few movies a week. I donno how could this happen to a brand new item.
1,This one is Toshiba Trash,"I bought this DVD player for the bedroom TV just in case I wanted to play a DVD in there. The second time I used it, it died. Of course, it was well out of its warranty period. It looks like many others had the same experience. This is the worst Toshiba product I have ever bought - my other Toshiba purchases performed well. Where was your quality control, Toshiba?"
3,Sometimes the majority is correct,"I purchased a Toshiba SD 3960 primarily for its all regions capability. Like everyone else within a year it began to give the error message that the disc was bad. This was with new DVDs right out of the package! Eventually it stopped playing any discs at all. After reading the above reviews this doesn't seem to be an atypical event. This product is flawed, which is a shame because I like the slim design, and when it did work, the quality was quite nice."
1,Don't even think of buying,"Like other reviewers I have experienced the ""Incorrect Disk"" error after very minimal use. I won't even think of taking it in for a repair. Hello trash can."
2,Died after 1.5 years,"I agree with the other negative reviews. I paid about $59 for it. This machine worked fine for about a year and a half, and maybe played 40 DVD's and a few CDs. Suddenly it refused to mount any discs whatsoever, giving an 'incorrect disc"" reading. The rejected discs, however, play fine on my laptop. Am very disappointed because it was easy to set up and had a very nice remote.Don't buy it!"
2,Good for a while and then...,"I purchased the SD-3980 at least two years ago and it worked fine for a while. I started noticing that a few discs would not start up and give an error, later almost every disc that went in resulted in an ""Incorrect Disc"". I suppose that for the price it is a very disposable unit."
1,Toshiba SD3980 Died after viewing 42 movies,"The player was in an excellent environment... level, clean, cool and no static. It mostly performed well until this last attempt to watch a movie when it could no longer read any disk... DVDs, MP3s, audio CDs. Tried unplugging to reset it and took off the cover to see if it could still spin a disk. After spinning a disk counter-clockwise until the LED on the panel displayed ""BAD"", the disk would stop and spin clockwise.It's replacement won't be Toshiba."
2,Interesting music; Nasty recording...,"This is a collection of interesting but rarely recorded modern chamber works featuring the harpsichord. I acquired it mainly for the Carter and Falla pieces, with which I'm familiar. The performances of this unusual repertoire are quite good, but they are sabotaged by poor sound. The harpsichord is uniformly under-recorded, so it's almost drowned out whenever the other instruments play. Still worse is the brutally harsh sound of the flute (and occasionally clarinet) in its' upper register, rendering listening quite painful. I've played it on several high-end stereo systems and the sound is still bad. The recording should be remastered or withdrawn from the catalogue."
4,Not a waste of reader's money,"I reviewed this text for CHOICE magazine some time ago, and in my opinion it is well written and understood. Did not read every page looking for errors. Any book has errors but in most cases the concept(s) are easy to follow. No author, editor, or publisher is infallible, and it is a professional courtesy to contact the author / publisher to bring errors and inconsistencies to his attention so that corrections can be made before the next printing. In my view, the best profreader is the reader, student or working professional. The one star review is certainly unfair to the author and I am very surprised that Amazon allows it. I wrote to Amazon to express my feelings on that, and the response was that it is within Amazon's guidelines! Extremely disappointed. An objective review should point out both the strenghts and weaknesses of the text and recommendations for improvement."
5,?,"Great tv show, every one should take time out of there day to see this show best tv show ever. Have a great day."
3,Maass' Destination is Clear but Not His Path,"Maass' critique of modern American capitalism is quite morally compelling. However, like most books of this sort, it is long on the analysis of what the problems are, and too short on the ""what is to be done?"" issue. Yes, most of us know we're on the wrong path as a society, but how do we find our way to the right one?Also, Maass decided not to use footnotes to support his conclusions, which will frustrate the reader who wishes to know more about the issues he raises. A small thing I guess, as this book clearly wasn't meant for the academic types, but to me it is Maass' principle shortcoming, as it will frustrate readers who are not well grounded in political and economic theory and its nomenclature.I'd still recommend The Case for Socialism though."
1,WHAT A LOAD OF CRAP!,"I only read the first few pages of this book here on the web site and that was enough to tell me that it is nothing but garbage! All of the problems he outlines, poverty, unemployment, etc. is due to our government's already socialistic agenda. It is government that has made life harder in America not capitalism. Taxation, regulation, spending, corruption, bail-outs. And it is always government that starts wars. When government adds on junk like ""carbon taxes"", signs legislation like NAFTA and forces people to buy health insurance, yes, jobs are going to be lost! But people like Alan Maass deliberately blame capitalism to get you to bow to government. This author is doing what socialists always do. Selling you a bill of goods. This is the same dog-n-pony show that Lenin used in Russia and look what happened there!"
3,Very good piece of work!,"I enjoyed this book very much, it laid down the problems that occur because of the capialist mode of production. However, he does not use footnotes and does not cite sources. (This is the reason for the 3 star rating)The ultimate goal of this book (in my opinion) is to create a dialogue about the problems of capitalism and the ultimate solution."
1,Whiney and chock full of sloppy reasoning,"Maas whines for page after nauseating page about how everything bad in the world is a result of capitalism. He stops just short of blaming it for earthquakes and volcanoes. However, he completely ignores the fact that over the past 200 years, capitalism has brought about unimaginable increases in standard of living, longevity, and prosperity for all, while every attempt at socialism has brought about misery, poverty, and death."
1,First one defective,"I bought this same model waffle maker at wally world for ten bucks. The cheap plastic snap-in hinge bolts broke only after 3 uses. I will return it, and try another one to see if it has the same defect. Will post new review with results."
4,I love it!!,I love these shoes!! Especially the color. The only problem is that your big toe hurts a little when you wear it for over 4 hours.
3,Moreno's Dictionary of Spanish-named cities and towns,"I did not realize that the books were paperback and new. I had been looking for the old hard cover editions from 1916. The books were fine and in good condition, just not what I had expected."
2,Not much help...,Lots of explinations and not much practical help. I found great solutions in the Love and Logic series... which had great ideas for helping my kid do better in school.
3,"GO BUY THE ANGRY SAMOANS, THEN COME FOR THIS","This is straight forward awesome rock and roll. They cover the Angry Samoans on here. The song ""somebody's getting screwed"" makes me want to hit people with my truck. By all means track down the RIPOFFS stuff first as a couple of these fools were in that band. Also check out THE MUMMIES and SUPERCHARGER two excellent garage rock bands.The Zodiac Killers are fast garage rock with good vocals, that and how can you possibly go wrong with a band from San Francisco that honors the infamous Zodiac Killer. BUY BUY BUY. THe only problem is that it's short, but if you buy it on CD you get an extra song, so it's a little better"
2,"Great Voice, Poor Balance","Nina Rautio has a beautiful powerful voice. Her expression and style for these songs is wonderful. Unfortunately she is overbalanced, to my ears. If I want to hear the interaction with the piano, and turn up the volume a little, that's when she hits a high not and blows my ears off. I don't know if there is software to correct this problem. I would like to find it. Miss Rautio is a marvellous talent. Her ""Joan"" is full of glorious work. Sadly, this disc only serves for songs that either noone else sings or if they do then their versions are feeble. With the advent of the Naxos series, obviously that means maybe one or two songs have their best representation here."
5,A Small Pet,"My 8 year old son read an adaptation of The Rice Bowl Pet in the Textbook Tricky Troll by William Eller to me. This is a nice story of a boy who wants a pet and how he solves the problem of it having to be a very small pet, with a little help. My son really liked this story. Recommended for 3rd - 5th grade."
4,A very good book,This story is about Ah Jim. He lives in Chinatown. Everyday he watches his neighbors and their pets. He decides that he wants a pet. His mother tells him he can have a pet if he can find one small enough to fit in to his rice bowl. Ah Jim searches all over town trying to find a pet to fit in to the rice bowl. Finally he finds a dog tiny enough to fit in to the bowl.
3,"Well Written, but Drags a Bit","This book is well written, with well-drawn characters and vivid settings. The hero and heroine are likeable enough and the secondary characters add extra dimension to the story. However, the main problem with this book is that it is often boring. While reading this book, I kept wondering where it was going and when the pace was going to pick up. Although there are some exciting action scenes towards the end, they seemed out of place and added only to give the book a semblance of a rousing conclusion. I even thought that the romance between the hero and the heroine was rather mundane. Overall, I would recommend this book for a pleasant enough waste of time, but this isn't an exceptional romance and it has a rather placid plot development."
1,Not Giant at all...,"I couldn't find one picture online that showed me how big these blocks are compared to regular ones. They're barely any bigger- you might as well spend your money on a complete set. For instance, when I pack these up with the regular blocks, I can't really tell them apart. We just like the round ones, they're a little harder to come by. But- these are definitely regular sized- nothing giant about them."
3,Strawberry & Champagne,"This is an okay product, but it's not worth the price. It doesn't really ""warm"" at all, and the taste is a bit too strong. It's fun to play with, but too expensive for what is offered."
1,I Have to Give Bell Credit,"This book is one of the many reasons why I am no longer a progressive. I actually read it many years ago. This nation, and the world at large, would be a far better place if more people read this book and decisively repudiated the views within."
2,Poorly Advertised,It says that this is the 3rd edition of the book but it is clearly not considering it says second edition right on the top of the book. I don't know whose fault it is but I still had to get the third edition and am now stuck with the second edition and out the money that I spent on it.
1,Way too small.,This should be called a Lime squeezer. Anything larger than a lime is mangled. I have a large lemon tree and many lemons to squeeze. This thing is worthlass to me.
2,For limes or mini lemons only!,I debated about this product after reading the reviews and decided to buy it for my wife who broke the pot metal squeezer we had. The metal is good but the design is terrible. the movable part does not compress the citrus directly but at varying angles depending on the diameter of the fruit. Hence I say only for limes or mini lemons. I found my wife using the old back up squeezer (the one you place over a container and twist the lemon over it). I felt like a jerk buying something so simple and yet so pourly designed. Maybe it's true that the French should stick to making wine and sauce dishes and leave the machinery for the Germans. Anybody want it cheap? e-mail me at: info@sewardparkrepairs.comGood luck.
2,juice squeezer,product is difficult to use as the handle is short and the pressure to squeeze the fruit requires extreme pressure from a very strong person. Have had others that are much easier to use.
5,5 year old mechanical engineer loves it,"If you have a mechanically minded child, this is a great toy. Simple enough yet versatile enough to keep them occupied. More than one vehicle can be built and creating your own vehicle combinations is possible. Fairly large pieces easy to keep track of and for a small child to handle.3 year old may need some help putting it together, 4 year old and up will probably figure it out on their own and have fun doing it. A 5 year old it was given to so far shows no signs of losing interest after accumulating hours of playing with this toy. We might be looking for more similar sets of these series. Can't beat it for the price."
4,Hours of fun,"My friend's 4 year old grandson loves this toy. He will sit on the living floor and play with this toy for hours on end, whereby he loses interest in other toys very quickly. When he comes over this is the only toy he pulls out of his toy box now. He loves it; we love it. I recommend it very highly!!!"
3,Rescue Tech,"Great toy, was played with a lot on Christmas day, but only three weeks later I have no idea where half the parts are. So, if you've got a super-responsible kid, this is a great toy; if you've got a kid like mine, maybe not!"
4,Some pearls in this book,"While much of this book is obvious, there are quite a few gems which make it worth while."
4,Yummy,"Not as thick as the beef jerky found in the store, which I like. Nice flavor. Check out all the different flavors and sizes."
5,omg!,the beef jerky is so good! it reminds me of the jerky from aafes (military onbase store) its just juicy enough but not too much
4,Very worthwhile reading!,"For me, the other reviews have said it all.In short, it is a very PRACTICAL manual - just as it purports to be."
3,Was recommended to me...,"...by a friend. He found it very helpful and enlightening for himself - I did not find it so much that way for me. It is pretty basic stuff, so I think it is good for ""starters""... those just waking up to their consciousness."
5,GEM OF A BOOK ABOUT GEM OF A LUTHIER + CD!!!,"This is one great book. Fabulous design (odd shape) with extraordinary examples of guitars built and designed by one of the most talented and creative luthiers ever. Danny Ferrington builds wonderful instruments. World-class musicians play them. Here you get to see AND HEAR (with the included CD, which you can't live without) some of Danny's most beautiful creations made specifically for some of the world's best players. The disc includes recordings of the players that the guitars were built for playing the instruments displayed in the book (my personal favorites include David Hidalgo, Ry Cooder, and Richard Thompson). Any guitar lover will cherish this exceptional treasure...now, just try to find one of the collector's batch which include a tweed ""guitar"" case made to form fit the book!!! WOW!"
2,Camp Chef carry bag--too big!,"This is a nice, study bag, but way too big for the stove. Therefore, I don't like it..."
4,All in one bag,"This product is a good product to put the two burner stove, legs and sides all in one convenient bag. It would have earned a 5 star rating but the price was on the high side. The manufacture should make this item available where they sell the stove or include it in the purchase. Never the less it is a good product."
4,Nice Carry Bag,"Bought the bag because the original product didn't come with one when I bought it locally. Stove fits in the bag nicely. Yes, it is a little big for the 2-burner stove I have, but that leaves room for accessories. I plan to put an inexpensive adjustable wrench in there, and maybe a butane lighter as a backup to the ignitor on the stove. Plus the griddle that came with the stove will fit in the bag also. Haven't had it long enough to comment on the durability of the bag yet, but my first impression is that the bag is sturdy and well made. I expect it to last a good long time. The wrap around handles make carrying the stove easy and seem solid. Overall, very impressed with the bag and the service from Amazon. Shipped quickly and qualified for free shipping."
4,camp chef cb60,"Arrived in the time frame they menioned. Evereything fit with plenty of room,you could fit other odds and ins in this bag to take up some of the empty spots. Quality is decent, I thought the price was a little steep for the quality , thats why I gave it four stars."
4,Camp Chef Carry Bag,A little big for the stove I bought but its well made and easy to carry the stove in.
2,Just an average bag,"I like to store my stove neatly in the garage. This bag serves that purpose. However, This bag is a little bigger than my Camp Chef EX-280LW. It caused the legs to move around inside. It is difficult to carry. I think the box that came with my stove would be much better than this bag."
2,Oversized,"This bag is way too oversized for a two burner stove. Unless you plan on stuffing a bunch of other stuff in this bag, the bag just does not fit the stove."
1,incorrect,"Ordered by serial number on stove but instead received some bag for much larger stove, at least six inches to long and to tall to use at all, waste of money...."
2,Don't use if you like heating stones,"It's designed to carry the grill on the side rather than flat, if you use any type of heating/flavor stones it will drive you mad. If you're just a propane user this case will work fine for you."
5,Great Carrying Bag,I received one of the expedition series grills for Christmas and decided to purchase this bag for storage and carrying. It fit perfectly and is made of very durable material. I highly recommend this bag.
2,Cheap...,"Ok, the good: everything fits and it's pretty easy to carry and stay organized. Affordable.Now the bad: Bag is as cheap as the price indicates. Fabric is already fraying after two camping trips. Was not abused in the slightest. The fabric for the legs/grease guard is see-through on the corners. Zero tolerance for the abrasion incurred during normal transport. The bag itself is beginning to fray on the outside as well.The verdict: If you camp once a year, buy this bag. It will last you about 3 years and you won't lose anything during storage or transport. If you camp 5 or 6 times a season, plan to buy a new one every season."
1,extremely disappointing,"I agree with the first reviewer that Soyer deserves more attention than he has received, but, unfortunately, this book is not the kind of attention he deserves.Baskind tries to fit all of Soyer's work into her narrow interpretative frame. I did not find her arguments convincing. Her focus seems to be on ""outing"" Soyer as a Jew (not really necessary, since this is a well-known aspect of his identity, and nothing he ever tried to hide), rather than telling us anything new about his work or its historical context. In fact, I found myself not trusting the biographical information she does report because it all seems to be twisted around to support her predetermined arguments.If you are interested in the question of ""What is Jewish art?"" you might enjoy this book, but if you are an admirer of Raphael Soyer, you probably won't."
2,Tries too hard to be funny,"""Rough as a Cob,"" by Ed Williams III, is a compilation of ten stories that attempt to be hilarious, but fail to deliver the punch at the end. They are based on growing up in the rural South of Juliette, Georgia and attempt too hard to use this as the root of the humor. (...)This book provides stories that are somewhat entertaining about the life of Ed Sr., Ed Jr. and Ed III. Somehow, visions of Ed, Edd and Eddy from the Cartoon Network come to mind. Anyway, we are provided the disturbing life of these three while the author presses hard for the laugh that is an occasional chuckle at most.Let's be honest. Is a plan to gang up on Santa Claus really considered funny? That is the level of humor we are given from the book.(...) A nice try that falls a few inches short of its goal."
3,Network works--Print server fails with Dymo label printer,"I chose this combination wireless router and USB print server because I needed both those functions and wanted to keep the equipment/wiring quantity down. However, the print server failed with our Dymo LabelWriter 400. This was unfortunate but not entirely unexpected. Printer compatibility is hit-or-miss with most of these.I solved this problem with a separate Netgear USB Mini Print Server (Model PS121), which was reported to work by Dymo. Now we can print wirelessly to our laser and the LabelWriter.Overall the functionality is fine. I think it compares favorably to my home network's Linksys WRT54G, though I would have simply bought another Linksys if I'd known up front that the integrated print server isn't compatible."
1,Support is terrible; product doesn't entirely work as advertised,"All the support guys are trained to be nice, but they are not trained on the technology and are useless. After 3 weeks of waiting, calling, waiting, escalating, waiting, escalating, waiting, referred to engineering, waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting. The product does not actually work with ISDN as advertised and no one at Netgear support has ever heard of ISDN.The device is really intended for a basic uncomplicated setup with Cable modem as the primary line and a regular modem as a dial backup or dial-in access method. For that, it seems OK.But for me, I'm packing it up and returning it because it doesn't actually work. Big disappointment. Lots of frustration."
2,Print Server does not support Multifunction Printers,"I recently upgraded from the WGR614 to this. From a router and wireless standpoint, this unit is MUCH better than the previous Netgear routers I had. The pretty silver units are nice for consumers, but I needed more options and more range. This unit does it all.However, and it is a BIG however, the Print Server (which was the main reason to spring for the total upgrade) does not support my HP PSC 2410 nor my EPSON Stylus CX5200. Those two things in themselves make it impossible for me to recommend the router overall. None of the Netgear products support this, and it makes no sense, since most people buy small multifunctions for their homes now."
4,great router if you need to connect via a serial modem,I use this router to serve up a wireless connection via a serial modem. Unless you need to connect to the Internet through a serial modem or need a modem as a backup connection you can save money with a cheaper router. The dial-on-demand feature works well and I've only had to reboot this router a couple of times. I get a strong signal and the router itself is in what feels like a sturdy metal case.If you are among the 5 of us out there still using dial-up and are tired of being tied to a phone cord I recommend this router. Be sure to visit the manufacturers web site to see what serial modems are supported. Mine wasn't on the list and it still worked but I may have gotten lucky.
2,poor printer compatibility,"I would like to comment on a few models of printers I have tested. Unboxed off the shelf, I tested this unit's print server capability and found it incompatible with all 3 tested models:- HP OfficeJet K60- HP DeskJet 3650- HP DeskJet 1220CI then upgraded the firmware and retested the print server capability. The HP DeskJet 1220C is now supported.FYI to new buyers, be sure to check the printer compatibility list before purchasing this product if you plan on utilizing the print server function.[...]"
3,great technique and that's it???,"While I admire Hamelin's technique, in these recordings it seems to be the only thing he brought to the studio. It really is something strange, but I prefer almost any other recording (try listening to Bernd Glemser's Fantasie op 28, or Second Sonata, and compare it with Hamelin's). It's like he had his emotions emulator in off mode.... Buy this disc collection if you want to have a complete set, but look elsewhere for a good Scriabin performance (Glemser, Sofronitsky, Richter, Pletnev, Horowitz)."
1,The WORST painting kit ever!,"I purchased this kit on December 15th and received it after Christmas. When my best friend opened it up in our living room she was very pleased with the packaging and number of canvas boards included. We wished that there were more ""famous"" paintings, but she was still happy.When she opened the paints to use it for the first time...they were all dry! I told her how sorry I was and to maybe add water to the paints...she told me that since they are acrylic paints, water wouldn't help. She tried anyway and she was correct.I contacted Amazon and had them send out a replacement AND asked them to please check the paints first. When I received the replacements, she opened the paints and it was the same issue. I give up!Terrible kit!(If you are the manufacturer, you should consider using tubes of paint rather than the tubs that are used for water-based water color paints. It may retail higher, but it would be worth it to the consumer to purchase something that can be used.)"
1,Disappointed,"Received this yesterday.. all I got was a book. no paint.. no canvas.. no paint by number, no brushes. Yes I orderd the KIT, and all I got was a small book.. not a happy camper here"
4,"Copeland drags you into a story of life,love & forgiveness","Copland starts off slow but graudally wisk you away with the caharacters in this novel. The detail picture she painted of France makes me long to go there. Being from New Orleans myself this book touch close to home as Vade the heroine is shower with the trails and tribulaton of her new home in American and being in the south were light skin blacks vs dark skin blacks is still prevalent. This book is a must read. Because through it all love, family, and freinds is the true meaning of happiness. Sometimes God allows certain things to happen in life that will bring you back to the middle."
1,Poorly Researched,"This is my first time reading Ms. Copeland's work, I will say first. So maybe I expect something different for a ""close family"" book. I read this very rushed book and grew more annoyed with the book as I continued to read it.The description of landmarks are horrible. I've never been to Paris so I cannot comment on it's land mark but I do know Grambling State University is not an hour from New Orleans.A simple map can show that.The names of the ""main"" character's name in the Book Description does not match ""main"" character's name in the book. Vade is ""main"" character, who is MignonThe only good points in this book is the close family ties and the realities different Country mindsets shown to Vade'. That is all I can say."
4,"""It's A Fun Read""","I enjoyed reading this book. I liked the characters and the storyline, but the ending was corny."
4,A Keeper!,this was really good fiction...it was a pretty tail of a family living in paris (i think) going through ups and downs. it shows diversity in this writer. i held my attention all the way through...The character Vade got on my nerves alot...but thats what kept my attention. i would definatley read it again. Shelia Copeland is a wonderful writer!
2,4 stars subtracted from 2,"STRONG POINTS: The fact that a black family was living in Paris, rich, and happy was a nice change. I loved Vade and Laurent's characters and dialogue. I thought the overall theme of love & family was great. J.P. was fun to read about as well as Vicente. WEAK POINTS: This book started off with 4 stars but as soon as Juliet appeared, it fell down to two and stayed there. Laurent & Juliet's whole scenario read like a corny fairy tale, was completely unrealistic, and the end seemed rushed. I was also annoyed with the CONSTANT use of the words ""Princess Sister"", ""chicken"", ""perfect"", and ""exotic"". Use a thesaurus PLEASE. Pop music with hip hop gear clash. And why would a man keep nail polish in his boxing shorts?"
3,Who was the Editor? Fire THEM!!!,"Ok, the book was alright but did Ms. Copeland do ANY research on what she was writng about? I live in New Orleans and her geography is all wrong. Also, she makes reference to Dillard University but spells it incorrectly. As a student I would like to point out that the college ( a top HBCU)is NOT spelled like the store. I couldnt focus on the plot because there were so many mistakes in the geography and spelling of streets, schools, and misc. other things. Grambling University is over an hour from the French Quarter but Ms. Copeland attempts to make it appear as though it is in New Orleans. Whoever was the editor for this book needs to be fired."
3,Okay,"This book began very slow and was hard to get into, but because of the previous books by Shelia Copeland I kept reading. It ended up being pretty interesting..Job well done again."
4,Great even if you have a big kitchen,"This book is from the '70's, before microwave ovens and food processors were common. The recipes and almost all of the advice is still very relevant today. The book contains dinner menus that are designed for people with tiny (or no) kitchens who love to eat and entertain. The authors describe how to prepare and serve delicious, impressive meals, yet mingle with one's guests. Their recommendations for equiping a small kitchen are great and relevant for anyone who is starting their first kitchen or organizing an existing kitchen. Buy the book for the Simon's Cheesecake recipe if for nothing else. I've had it since 1987 and it is time for another copy. Bob, Dick, how about a sequel, please?"
2,Ho-hum,"Maybe my own fault for not fully researching the book, but was disappointed that the author was only 11 at the time of Explo '72 and too young to go. So then, I hoped it was an informative account of contemporary Christian music of the '70's and into the '80's. I found out it is another bland book of ""look at me, I'm coming of age"" and a few attempts at humor. I really gained nothing by reading it."
5,Good piece of history with a personal touch,I bought this book because I was told it features a picture of the house I just purchased in La Honda. It's a delightful account of the author's observations of the area and the people on the SF Coast.\
1,"Bad bike! No, no!","I've been the unfortunate owner of several Huffy bikes. Here's why. I buy a Huffy bike, do $60 worth of damage to it while falling down in a ditch, yet I can buy a brand-new shiny one at Wal-Mart for $70. Huffy crankcases have always been bad due to cheap bearings, bad seals, and their steering assembly tends to leak too. I've had my Huffies serviced by numerous shops and when they're not laughing at me, they're trying to sell me a better bike. I took them up on the offer and bought a Raleigh mountain bike and haven't yet bent a rim. The crankcase works perfectly, is durable and I haven't seen a bit of rust on my bike yet. Save your money, get something decent for yourself - you deserve it!"
2,Baah! Steel Frame with cantilever brakes,"Very Entry Level, might be OK for beginner or kid @11yrs, but Steel frame is too heavy for a new bike otherwise. Steel parts, import alloys. You can get into one with lighter frame for about $40 more. Frame has a lifetime warranty because it is like a brick.I saw this or very similar model at Toys-R-Us 2 weeks ago, non-Shimano parts I thought, would be hard to replace. It would get you from point A-to Point B, just not as good as an aluminum frame. Plastic chain guards and similar,non-adjustable suspension, low-end tires. This would have been a pretty sweet bike to own back in 1993 though."
5,"""Winning Through Witnessing""","Duke was the student football team dentist at The Ohio State University during the Woody Hayes era. He has taken some of Woody's core ideas of ""Winning with People"" and applied them to help coach committed christians in the art of witnessing. Every christian family, congregation, or individual who wishes to increase their ""batting average"" in the bringing of saved souls to the Lord will find this book most helpful. The book is a delightful and instructional collection of Duke's own personal quest to become the very best he could become in bring individuals to the Lord. A must evangelical read. Dr. Arthur c. Huston DDS"
1,don't buy!!,"For $200 this coffee grinder sucks. It's missing nice/easy to add features, like rubber stoppers on the bottom!! Both hands are busy, one holding the espresso handle and one operating the doser and the machine slides all over the counter. Also the doser never worked on my machine. It never dispensed the correct amount of coffee...and the coffee that came out of the dispenser went everywhere. Plus the dispenser handle was less than smooth to pull. I hate this machine."
5,Excellent choice,"Makes a huge difference in coffee quality if you compare it to a blade grinder. Love it. Only drawback : the portafilter does not fit 100% in the grinder so every time some of the ground coffee spills. Gaggia could do better on this one. Overall, great choice."
3,Decent cup,"Not bad, but it is difficult to walk with it filled up because the cup is fairly shallow and spills easily."
5,"Perfect Size, Durable, Multi-Use","These cups are the perfect size! They are large enough to eat soup out of, or cereal, but they can also be used as giant tea cups. I ordered them for my dorm room and use them all the time. They are also pretty durable because I have dropped one of them twice and it hasn't cracked!"
