2,Disappointment,"The item which was requested and received was missing the very first DVD as well as another. There was 1 duplicate DVD also. Was very dissatisfied over this, as well as not being able to get a replacement item, which wasnt available to ship and had to re-order if i wanted."
5,"for a runner at 70 m a week, this is a BUTT KICKER in a good way","My husband bought this three weeks ago. i have supplemented my long runs/ ellipti-runs (non impact just as hard) and biking w/ one or two sessions of Insanity. i do the fit test, w/o breaks, then the Max interval w/o breaks, just hop on my spinner in between, and then do about 10-20 minutes of another video. to get to about 100-110 minutes. AND I am soaking wet,and sore in a good way, and invigorated.the Plyo moves, and high cardio are perfect for runners to get quicker, and have more endurance. in fact this is wayyyyyy harder than regular running. or even sprint intervals, as these loonggg intervals use the whole body. not just the legs.so. you runners and cyclists out there, try it out. It is so INSANE. You will love it, and i swear after three weeks (three long sessions) i already see more abs and have tightened up a bit too.ps: the Army National Guard Special Forces use this too, as well as P90X to stay fit."
5,INSANE,"the name says it all, hard but worth every minute you spend using this product, highly recomend. Be prepared to work your ass off"
4,Insanity,Came with complete package deal yay. Only have had one little trouble with one of the dvds so far and am half way through the program.LOVE love love the program though. Shaun T is a great instructor and the exercises are definitely challenging but possible.
4,Insanity!,"Almost done with my first month and I see amazing results! Clothes fit better, gaining muscle tone, and gaining confidence."
5,Great insane workout!!!,"Very good cardio workout, not hard to follow and the overall design is easy to do. The INSANITY part comes when you keep up the pace!!! I really like doing the workouts every other day and do it at my own pace. I can really feel a difference and have done the workout for about 3 1/2 weeks so far. My wife does the workout every few days along with going to the gym and other workout videos but likes the cardio."
5,A truly INSANE workout!,"The Insanity Workout is just like it says, insane! My husband and I have done the P90X workout, and decided to give this a try, and it is MUCH more intense than P90X. My husband is in very good shape, and this workout is kicking his butt! Say nothing for me, I don't think I will master these workouts within 60 days, it may be more like 6 months before I can even come close to keeping up with exercises on this dvd set. Which is great! It will challenge me for quite a while, so you definately get your money's worth!"
2,not impressed,"I got this workout as a cardio circuit after doing P90X and before doing P90X2 - however, there is pretty much no upper body to this workout - after I noticed my arm muscles getting flabby I decided to move on to something else . . .Like several other reviewers have said it is the same thing over and over again and is really boring . . . I'd save your money if I were you . . ."
4,It's great!,"I wish they had 10 minute and 30 minute workouts, but i like Shawn t and the exercises...one of the best workouts i've ever had!"
5,omg,"Love Insanity, if you want to get fit buy this.Hard at first but gets simple once you get used to itNervous for next month though."
4,Crazy workout,"You need to be ready to commit. Hard workouts, but definitely beats going to the gym. Recommend it for anyone willling to commit to a program and serious about getting into shape."
5,Insanity is a MUST...see my RESULTS! meetjasonroberts.com,"Length:: 3:47 MinsIf you are considering Insanity, please look at my transformation! Visit me at meetjasonroberts.com"
3,I want to love this... BUT,"I got this for Xmas and was very excited - spent the first four days doing this according to plan. I should add that I am in my 30's and teach fitness classes at my gym and am in pretty decent shape. I exercise regularly. However, I have a history of issues with my knees. I can avoid flare ups if I avoid lunges, etc. This DVD set makes it literally impossible for people with joint issues - especially knees - to participate in this without seriously injuring themselves. This is stated on the warning at the beginning of the program - however, nowhere did I read that before dropping $150 to order. Shaun T is awesome - the program is challenging and if you are looking for something to use at home, get this. It is addicting and intense. However, if you have even the slightest issue with your knees, DO NOT BUY THIS!"
4,Bananas,This workout is bananas! Crazy sweat comes off you fast. If you want to sweat a lot this is your workout. I use to have bad knees before this workout having popping and cracking noises and I did have problems with them in this workout. But if you press on through it your legs will get crazy strong. Like my biggest problem was if i needed to all of the sudden run across the street or just run spontaneously I could not without having pain in one of my knees. But now i can jog or sprint across without having to do a stretch or warm up first.I still need to do the last part of the program which is the Max cardio portion which i know I am going to get hammered!The ab routine is like nothing you ever done before. You definitely feel your stomach working. The only thing is I would like to have some weights included in some of the routines.
5,Nothing Like It,"Follow the directions, and you get in amazing shape for working out less than 39 minutes a day. Couldn't be happier. Way less painful/boring than the treadmill, way more effective & healthy.If you're more into looking good/bulking up, I'd go with P90X."
5,Insanity v P90x,"I have always been somewhat active but not in as fit as I would like to be I wanted to share some comments on Insanity having also done P90x. I have found with Insanity the cardio emphasis has been helping me get the weight loss going much faster. It's really about getting lean,strong and flexible whereas P90x involves more weight training with resistance bands, chinup bar and other tools. For me its much easier not to have to use all the equipment and just my body as the ""weight"". Depending on your goal both are excellent but I find I'm still building muscle but am much leaner with Insanity. I highly recommend Insanity if your goal is weight loss and overall cardio endurance and flexibility."
3,DVD's messed up,"The workouts themselves are great. Anyone who complains about them being too tough just has to modify and slowly build up to doing what the on-screen crew is doing.The problem that I have has to do with the quality of the dvd's. I ordered two sets -- one to give as a gift. In both sets the routines ""Max interval sports training & Insane abs,"" and ""Insane abs,"" jump from one part of the routine to another every ten seconds or so. The on-screen timer jumps around with the sceen-changes, but the dvd timer clicks along in the normal fashion, so the dvd's were 'printed' this way. In one of the sets I received, all of the dvd's that are supposed to contain two routines do not have the second one.Beachbody publishes this and does not seem be a quality company. When I contacted them about the problem, they were uninterested because I had purchased from secondary sources. If you want to purchase this workout, do so knowing that you may be getting only part of what you are paying for."
5,Insanity 60 Day Work Out,Great results thus far and I'm only on day 23 :D This product definitely exceeded my expectations.I recommend this product
4,Great cardio..,I've tonned a lot from insanity! I recommended %100 :) specially if u want a beach body with great abs.
3,Insanity copy,"Two of the copies are out of order, just when you start an exercise, it jumps to another. But still an effective workout program"
2,Great workout - awful DVD quality,"The workout is terrific! The problem is that the DVD's themselves will only play on one DVD player I own, and even then, the freeze frequently. This is incredibly frustrating!"
5,I love my insanity workout,"This work out video is for you if you love to sweat. Dedication is a must. I like to go for runs and the gym, but I do not sweat as much as I do with the Insanity. I definitely give it 2 thumbs up."
3,Some DVDS are unusable,Most of the DVDs work fine but when you get to the last few ones specifically the Extreme abs one it doesnt play the whole DVD it automatically jumps you into the half way point with no way to backtrack. It almost looks like it was burned from a computer onto a DVD.
5,awesome!,"i ordered insanity thinking it was going to be open and used because i was buying it as a used product but when it came in (arrived not even a week after i ordered!) it was still in the plastic wrap with everything included. so excited to start! havent put the dvds in yet, but as long as they work, 5 stars!"
3,One or two of the discs is intense enough for me,"I usually find exercise videos to be too easy, but have three kids and am really busy so was looking for something I could do at home when I saw this infommercial. My husband bought it for me for Christmas. Of all the discs it comes with, I found only one disc,the Pure Cardio and Cardio Abs, that I use regularly because I thought the others were a little too slow or easy. An Insaner Insanity would be a good next DVD. It is good for someone like me who is fit, exercises regularly, is not overweight, and needs an intense workout. Let me add that this DVD provides a lot of diversity of motion, side to side motions, that are good for someone who might have repetitive motion injuries, such as myself who can no longer run 40 minutes a day 7 days a week due to a hip injury and a bad back. I love it."
5,THANKS!!!,"Thank You so much!!!You saved me a lot of money!!Even though I bought it used, it looked like new!!!Thank you Amazon!!!"
5,KICKS MY A#$!!,Sean T kicks my butt! Love it and love the fact I can work out in my own house without anything but these dvds.
4,"Great cardio, but high impact on the knees","I really like the approach of the workouts- each starts with a warm-up, and stretching is emphasized a great deal throughout.The workouts certainly do make you sweat and get your heart rate up. However, there are a lot of high-impact exercises that could cause stress on the knees. I've found that I can usually substitute such exercises with ones that are lower-impact."
5,Insane!!,I just finished my first week and I have already lost 10 lbs!!! I am following the diet guide and am following the exercises to my comfort level.
5,Insanity is Insane!,"Awesome workout. Highly recommend being in some kind of shape before doing this type of workout. Not meant for starters. I am sure you can work up to it but at what price? If you are like me, it was too much at first. I was way too out of shape thinking I could handle this. I felt frustrated that I couldn't keep up - wanted to quit many times (and did few times). But keep at it. I just tried to maintain and concentrated on form. It took awhile (for me anyways - at 49). I like the workouts and the way it is set up (broken down). If you can keep up - great! If not, maintain form and it will come! Good Luck to you!"
1,Don't order from Fightclub,"I ordered the Insanity DVD set from Fightclub on Amazon. When the DVD's arrived from China, they were horrible quality. They skipped forward sometimes up to 2 minutes at a time and one wouldn't play in the DVD machine at all. The seller refused to admit there was an issue until I got Amazon and my credit card company involved. I finally got a refund after I mailed the set back (I had to pay for the shipping). I then ordered Insanity directly from Beachbody and they play fine. The workouts are great."
1,Bought Used from Amazon - Was a pirated version that was grainy and missing sound in many places,"I purchased this DVD set used from Amazon. The set arrived promptly, but the packaging and documents looked like low-quality photo-copies on thin paper. The DVD sound did not work in many places and the video quality was poor. The vendor accepted the return of the set and I bought a brand new set from the original publisher, rather then through Amazon. I wish Amazon could protect us better from pirated books, software and videos."
2,Buyer Beware when purchasing DVD's from Franklin Supermart,"Franklin Supermart (seller profile)Shirley Co, in Alhambra,CANADA, make me so unhappy.I ordered Shaun T, Insanity the Ulitmate Cardio Workout & Fitness DVD Program and some of the DVD's I couldn't play on my DVD player here in the United States because the disc said ""Area Limitation"".So now I have to resend those DVD's at my cost back to them (Shirly Co in Alhambra CA) to do whatever they need to do.When I emailed the seller (Franklin Supermart) and asked what the term ""Area Limitation"" meant, there was no explanation, instead I was told in the email to send the DVD's back to them. on my dime."
2,too repetitive,"I consider myself an intermediate/advanced exerciser. I really wanted to like this work out. It is too repetitive. I don't know why but my body started to leech nutrients from my skin, so my knuckles became dark. I took a multivitamin and copper (to help with iron absorption). Callenetics is boring as heck, but at least I only have to do that every other day and can eat what I want. With Insanity, I started to gain inches and pounds on a modified diet (2000 calories per day). At 30 Something, I think I am too old to be jumping around, lol. Also felt I had much better and longer lasting cardio gains with THE FIRM and Cathe Workouts."
3,Pretty good (there wasn't a 2.5 rating option),"The dvds came promptly, which I really appreciated. And although I ordered the items used, it was in great condition. The only issue is that 3 of the dvds I received did not work (2 would not play chronologically and jumped around and one would just flat out did not play). ""Cardio abs"" was doubled up on another dvd workout so I could still do the workout. However, ""insane abs"" and ""max interval sports and insane abs"" skipped around and I could NOT do the workout. I believe both these workouts were supposed to come with the deluxe version of Insanity, which I did not order, but it was sent to me anyways. My major concern was that if I didn't receive them, someone else would have and been sorely disappointed to get a couple faulty dvd workouts."
3,Not a good investment for a teenager.,"My son begged me to purchase the total body workout. I was hesitated because we all know how a teenager attention span is. I should have listened to my first intuition, after the first week he quit. Not a good investment for a teen ;0("
4,not bad,"am about to start week 4. My cardio is SO much better. My heart rate recovers much much quicker and I feel like I have more energy. I did the cardio recovery today, and then ran 2 miles, then I took a short 2-4 minute break and ran 2 more. I alternated the pace, but I just had to keep increasing the speed. I couldn't believe how good my heart felt and how easy it was to run (once again). I hadn't felt so good running in years (or even really ran), cause I could actually run! like I used to! Once I stopped I felt like a could go again. The point is that it's a lot of cardio and you start to notice a change right away. Do what you can, break as needed, eventually you do more and break less."
3,Insanity Workout Review,"It is very okay. It is probably the best cardio you will ever get in your life. However for the first month, the exercises are extremely repetitive. You will not really work your upper body much if getting jacked is what you're looking for. To be honest, I'm a little surprised that there is not a ton of ab work. With that being said, if you want to get in shape and burn some fat/calories, this is a great workout for that. So far, I personally have not seen results worthy of advertisements on the television. However, I have probably trimmed down some, and I know my cardio has improved. In two words, it's ""all right."""
4,insanity,"I love the work out, I haven't been through all the DVD's yet. One of the DVD's does seem to be scratched though, I continuously stops and waits a minute before restarting. This is very annoying, but I do love the workout. It kicks my butt every time."
5,Starting Off....,I am on the nutrisystem diet and Im thinking about adding this to my workout routine. I go to the gym everyday for three or fours hours. Im looking to cutting back to just one or two hours and doing Insanity everyday. Will this diet work good with it?
3,Insanity Work Out,"This workout is as it suggests insane, it's been a month since I started this workout routine, but I have yet to see any results. I wish there were more focus on abs. It does make you sweat like crazy, but is very repetitive and warm up, and stretching takes up most of the 45 min. of the total workout."
3,Hard on the knees,"This workout is insanity!The good: You do get results, and I am in the best cardio shape ever.The bad: This work out is extremely hard on your knees. By the 30 day mark, both of my knees hurt all the time. I had to stop doing the jumping exercises and substitute other ones.All in all I have enjoyed doing this workout. You have to be committed to both the workout and the diet program for maximum results."
5,"Insanity,P-90X+","I did one round of P-90 wish I loved, than I started P-90+ wish was more intense and quicker (love it also) and know I've stared Insanity, which I also like alot. I'm doing my own mix of P90X-Plus for the weight's, upper body workouts, and switch to Insanity every other day, I'm getting the best of both worlds. P-90X Plus weight workouts and Insanity (cardio workouts). Highly recommend"
5,Day by Day,"I am on Day 10 of Insanity and am 50 lbs overweight. What I love about this program so far is that it will never get old in regards of applying the exercises/exersion to your fitness level at that given time. So, I can get through the program at my level (which is poor right now) by modifying the exercises or just doing the exercise at a slower pace. So, they may be doing 2 reps for my 1 at times. And that's OK. Shaunt T stresses constantly to do this at your own pace. It even states that on the screen while you are working out. You need to know the limits of your body and DO NOT go past them otherwise you will be injuring yourself and be completely sore. Take it slow if you have to. Noone runs a marathon with one day's training."
4,"Very Intense, Love it!!!!","Very intense, no nonsense 60-day workout program. Being a 2 time P90X graduate, I hate running and I wanted to lose some more body fat, thus I needed to do more cardio. Like P90X, Insanity fits my needs perfectly. I can do everything from home, on my own time and Shaun T keeps you motivated. I'm currently doing a P90X\Insanity hybrid, P90X 3 times a week and Insanity twice a week. My only complaint about Insanity is that the warmup part of it is kind of long, so much that it's necessary for me to stretch even before I do the warmup. Also, some of the routines in the DVD's are kind of repetitive. Program definitely is geared towards the more advanced exercise enthusiasts, though you can of course always modify. All in all, you will find that this is an exceptionally challenging, high intense cardio calorie burning program. You will sweat buckets and you will see results if you stick with it, just start out slow if necessary at first and take extra breaks."
1,The only thing that's insane is the price,"$144.00?? Are you serious?? This set isn't worth a quarter of that. Maybe if the DVDs were made out of gold or platinum, but they're just plain old DVDs. Think about this: a movie like Terminator 2 cost millions of dollars to produce and you can buy the DVD for $10. These DVDs cost nothing to produce; it's just a bunch of people working out in a crappy gymnasium, and yet they want to charge $144?? Don't make greedy execs at beachbody rich; boycott these DVDs."
1,horrible product,The ONLY good thing about this product was the nutrition guide which is definitely not worth the 157$ I paid for this. I am pretty fit and healthy already but I really wanted abs like the ones they advertise you get by doing this program. First they ask for waay too much money then the workout is not insane its ridiculous You are much better off paying 20$ a month for a gym membership and getting fit with regular excersize and the right nutrition best of luck with your goals :)
1,Horrible...,I received the DVDs and none of them worked. I tried them on 3 different computers and 3 different DVD players. I attempted to contact the seller and never heard back. DO NOT PURCHASE ANYTHING FROM GINA FOR LESS! You will be throwing your money away like I did.
2,To Easy,"Ok here it goes. If you have bad knees, shoulders, or any other body part then this is not for you. If you are already in shape then this will not get you in more shape. Insanity is just a cardio work out and it is difficult at time but there is nothing in the videos that you can't do on your own. For 30 to 60 minutes you will do mainly a leg, calf, thigh, and butt work out with some push ups and abs in there too. Many times through the videos some of the exercises repeat from previous workouts that you have already completed.My final statement is: If you belong to a gym or have the motivation to do some physical activity with your life the don't buy this.If you are one of those people who try a new diet or fad every week to try to lose weight or get in shape then try this out waste your money and start something new the next week."
2,"Insanity""","The Item got to my home fast, within a few days. The only issue I had was that some of the extra DVD's were scratched up and would not play. The Item was cheap pricewise so I did not bother with returning it. The important DVD's worked just fine. So over all I am pleased with my service."
3,my knees couldn't take it,"I finished the first 4 weeks, and my fitness level really jumped, but i started feeling pain in both knees whenever i do the workout, then the pain continued to be with me in everything i do in my life....I was really dissappointed because i started to feel the defference at the same time i decided to quit the insanity workout.This is an update for my past review, After i stopped this program and found how my fitness level became soooooo bad, i knew that insanity workout was an excellent product, Although my knees are better now, I really miss the insanity days.Insanity workout is a great program BUT u must get ready for it first, U have to strengthen your quadriceps muscles very well befor starting in order to prevent knee problems."
2,Seller not dependable,"I am enjoying the Insanity program. It took about 3 weeks to get here though. Also, as I progressed into my workout, a couple of the 'new' dvds wouldn't work on my computer. I had just taken them out of the packaging. Sometimes I would have to re-insert the dvd 10 times before it would work. Other dvds work fine. Anyway, I contacted the seller about a possible return and was informed they are no longer with amazon. This makes me feel like I was cheated."
4,great workout,Great price and received it quickly. Excellent workout for those wanting to lose weight and get into shape fast. Highly recommend
4,Great toning workout,"I love the workouts! They remind me of being back in track and basketball with the plyometric drills. I am 30 days in, I have been following the diet, and I have not missed a work-out yet. I have noticed improvements in the tone of my legs, butt, and shoulders. My biggest disappointment is the lack of weight loss. I can't say that I had a ton to lose to begin with, but the promise of the program is a total body transformation. The testimonials demonstrate significant weight loss. Most of the work-outs are among the toughest I've tried. I like the challenge and the motivation that ShawnT provides throughout the video. I wish the meal plan had more variety, but I can't complain about it's ability to keep you feeling full. WIth high levels of protein, if you stick to eating every 2-3 hours, you won't have the cravings that cause you to cheat.It's definitely worth the money! Good luck!"
5,great,"Just like it was described, very good and and easy transaction. All discs were in great shape and have not had any problems with this product since i have received it. Shipping was great and received my order before it was stated the earliest it would show up so shipping was nice and fast."
5,"The best workout ,","Insanity the great motived ,workout,nutrition,aerobic,power,cardioi,fit,stretch,flexibility,funny,happy,I'm enjoy my insanity,I spoke with friends,clients.Insanity is amazing,deep,hard.I start this week,so happy,exceed. I waited for results and object ."
3,Depends on your goals,"Long story short, you can get a more effective cardio workout with more traditional burst interval training in a much shorter time. You can get stronger and more toned, quicker, with weight training. But you can't do both simultaneously. If you have trouble motivating yourself, have a limited schedule, and care more about getting toned than strong, this workout is probably fantastic. I, however, was disappointed."
1,Not for persons with joint issues,"Do not buy Insanity if you have any joint issues - shoulders, knees, etc. The moves are high impact/high stress. I contacted the company by phone and email, several times, prior to my purchase decision, to find out if persons with joint issues should or should not buy. However, no reply was ever received. Unfortunately, I decided to try the DVD's but am not able to use them; a waste of $150. Rather than direct a potential customer to another product and, thus, retain the customer, BeachBody has chosen to lose a potential lifetime customer."
4,INSANITY: 60-Day Total Body Conditioning Workout DVD Program,"Nothing wrong with the program but you need time on your hand and need to be already in good shape, otherwise.....really tough!"
4,"So far, it is what it says it is.","Great product. Believe the infomercial, believe the hype, believe you're gonna sweat.You should decide if a program and format like this is right for you and that you have the time for it before investing. It is worth the money. I'm just slightly dissapointed with the lengthy warmup. I feel like I should be going hard for a full 60 minutes. But this workout is tough and I do look forward to it finishing up. (Meaning, it's rough and I want it to be over.) But the sense of accomplishment after each workout is completely & undeniably worth it and the results are unprecedent.Thanks!If you think you might be ready, you're ready. You deserve this."
4,"Good for your heart, bad for your knees.","My sister had the Insanity DVD's and I absolutely loved borrowing them from her. I decided to get my own set and start the 60 day program. The workouts are great and work almost all of your muscle groups while keeping you moving constantly. Despite my love for this program, I did have to stop after 2 weeks due to the severe straining of my knees. I ignored the warnings from other users about knee injuries... DO NOT USE if you have any knee issues. I'm only 22, but have had an ACL tear and knee surgery 5 years ago. All of the jumping and quick movements started to really damage my knee over just a few days. I only use it sparingly now, but cannot keep up with the grueling 60 day program due to my knee issues. Also do not use if you have back problems. The company is serious about this too and posts a very clear warning at the beginning of each video. I absolutely love the workout, but I'm not willing to put my health on the line any further."
5,Insanity is right,"I've been into fitness for most of my life, but this series really takes it to a new level. If you're looking to get into shape before you buy it, my advice is to keep jumping in the air, running in place, and doing squat thrusts. Then you'll be ready, but the first week will still hurt! After that your muscles adjust, and you really do see improvement. I recommend also buying a heart rate monitor so you can see your calorie burn. Some people can burn 700 calories, I'm a smurf so I only burn 300 per session. Reality check!"
4,bueno,"Es un lindo libro pero le falta alguna poesia o prosa de Gabriela Mistral, se habla de la artista pero no se muestra su obra"
4,nice,I love this purse best one I ever owned. It's such a nice purse. I have gotten spot of good comments on it
1,WHAT WAS I THINKING!?,"THIS ALBUM REALLY SUCKS, WHAT THE HELL WAS I THINKING? NEVER AGAIN WILL I JUDGE AN ALBUM BY ITS COVER."
4,Christmas shopping made easy,This watch was a present..daughter in law loved it! It was quite large so we needed to have some links removed. Great person or business to shop with!
5,Pretty little watch,"If you're looking for a simple, clean-designed jewelry watch/casual watch, I'd recommend this one. For me the the square shaped watches look more elegant and this one is just beautiful with its rounded-square face :) Oh, and the dial is made of mother of pearl. Again: beautiful. Simple."
5,YES!,"Though many say that ""Nail"" was Foetus's best album I believe that this album is equaly good. It may not be as ""refined"" as Nail, but this album can be listened to over and over, and you'll never get tired of listening to it. Its impossible for me to describe WHY this album is so amazing, but I love it. Give it a chance, the more you listen to it the better it gets."
2,"Looks very nice, but a pain to dissemble parts and install","First of all, the instructions that come with this lever are USELESS except for a couple of pictures. They aren't written in good English (""alien wrench,"" for example) and they are not detailed at all.To Begin: Spray WD-40 on/into/around the lever and give it time to sink in. Wrestle the lever back and forth until it comes off the rest of the parts. This will take considerable effort and patience. Next, unscrew the top part of the remaining section from the gold 2-pronged part at the bottom.When Installing: You may need to add a couple of washers (inside the tank, of course) to get the lever to fit snugly. Also, if I remember right, some of the tightening is done counterclockwise rather than clockwise. Finally, be advised that the lever may not fit back easily onto the part that you wrestled it off of originally."
2,Too strong for my cur,"Seller was quick, package came as described... Power level on this collar is entirely too strong for my black mouth cur (50 lbs), had it on level 1 and still caused too much stress on her. Switched to dogtra 280NCP which is amazing and very close to the same price. If your dog isn't a police/sar dog than I would advise to stear away from this product.Pros: Small, lightweightCons: Belt clip is awful (plastic, flimsy, doesn't hold), too powerful"
5,Haven't stopped thinking about the characters since I finished the book,"Other people here have written about Absaroka's plot, so I won't repeat. This is an excellent book! It moves fast, is easy to read, and captures your heart. I found myself forgetting that I was reading and instead thinking I was living the drama of the story. The character development across a variety of cultures is on pitch and very true to Wyoming way of life.If you want to learn about the realities of ranching in the West, this is a great place to start. The ranching, mixed with the struggles of a young soldier struggling with PTSD, create a compelling drama with lessons about patience, tolerance, and charity. And it has a happy ending. Curl up with Absaroka on a cold night. You'll be a better person for it."
5,Excellence in western adventure and romance!,This book is an excellent choice for any reader. It moves quickly and precisely from beginning until the end. The protaginist is a true-to-life man who deals with the hardships of life in Wyoming after the Vietnam War. I found myself entranced by the story and the setting. Matt Reed is truly a character for the ages. I was constantly taken back to the 1800's through a modern day hero. This a book for anyone who has ever struggled against the gravest of odds in there life and dreams to come up a winner. Do yourself a favor and buy this book and two for two friends it will pay you back ten fold. As for myself I hope the author continues the epic saga with another novel. I wait anxiously...
5,Serious Fun,"Jonah Winter's poems are extremely capacious without ever being talky. Their silences are as meaningful as their music. And the sense of playfulness, which is deeply serious too, makes a lot of the other postmodernists look like pikers next to this dazzling musician of language and imagery. A great addition to OC Press's cunning array of genuinely original poets"
5,great movie,"One of my all time favorite movies, I mean c'mon Sean Connery is in it! ""Welcome to the rock"" haha"
4,good blades,"smooth cutting, narrow kerf,they came in a box which was easier to deal with than the hard plasticthey have been packaged with for the last few yearshave not had a breakage problem with this batch yet"
5,"I love toy soldiers, this set is awsome.","This set I really liked because it had all the soldiers I liked. It also had really cool tanks,planes,and a cool helicopter."
3,Cool old school style play toy,It was fun setting up the toys and playing with them. I actually set them up and filmed still shots for a short movie my class was making.
1,I'm sure it's exactly this time some where in the world,"After the 2 of us read the entire (English) instruction book carefully and step-by-step set the clock for Pacific Standard Time, it repeatedly re-set itself three hours off in the AM and four hours off in the PM."
5,Atomic Clock,Oregon Scientific atomic projection clocks are great. I have three of these closcks and am looking forwared to buying 2 more.
1,"Cheap, does not do what it promises","The unit is supposed to have a projection LED. The manual states that ""When the unit is plugged into AC outlet, the projection alarm will continuously project the time."" This does not happen. What good is the projection when in the middle of the night you have to find the clock, find the right button and read the time befor the light goes out? How do you trust a company like this?"
5,Good projetction clock....,Nice little clock....third one I have bought. Only one precaution.....follow the set-up instructions step by step for a good outcome!
1,La Crosse WT-5110U,"This projection alarm clock did not function as descriped. The projection only showed when a button was pressed, and then it was not very large and/or clear. If I have to press a button to see the projection then I might as well just look at the clock. Don't waste you time or money by purchasing this item."
3,Small projected time - need full darkness to see,We have 14' ceilings and the projected time is very small compared to the last projection clock we had by Sharper Image. It also is not very bright but can be seen in full darkness.The price was right and it was simple to setup.
3,a fair release,"Joseph Hill has struggled to find his footing for the close to 20 years since he split up his classic Culture lineup that produced the amazing ""Two Sevens Clash,"" and ""Africa Stand Alone"" lps.During these years, the revamped culture lineups have released lps of varying quality, with ""One Stone"" being the best release in years. ""Wings of a Dove,"" while having good tracks, seems to me to be overproduced and too slick for my tastes. the over polished feel takes away from Culture's overall effect.A fair lp, there are better to be had."
5,Culture at its best!,"I have eight culture albums and have seen them 3 times now. I am also an avid reggae listener and enthusiast. I love this album it ranks up there with one of culture greatest works. Listen to tracks 7 and 8 they are very hot. Go buy this album so culture is able to tour the US more often, so we all can enjoy great live reggae music!"
4,listen to English Fireplace - A great ballad,"A good reggae group. I espcially love the last track ""english fireplace"""
5,Mystery puzzles,Love trying to solve these before she does. Anyone who likes to solve things before the end would loves this series.
4,A HIDDEN GEM,"This falls in line with the likes of Wolf Pact & Alarm Agents. A solid collaboration between Boyd Rice and Douglas P. Boyd supplies the lyrics and spoken word, while Douglas provides his trademark musical stylings along with support from John Murphy, Timothy Fenn and Campbell Finley. A must have for all fans of Death In June."
4,Train would't move Part 1/2,This song relate today and now what's happen in the world. I can understand what Mrs. Haywood.
5,perfect bunny,the beats and rhythms are awesome and hypnotic. the words are deep and universal. perfect bunny.
3,"Like the shoes, but can't fit them:-)","I recieved my shoes in good timimg. However, I can't keep them because I can't fit them. I usually wear a 7 1/2 but these shoes felt like they were a size to small. I also think they look a slight bit better online than in person. I still like the shoe though. Just not my favorite:-)"
4,nice watch,"The price for the watch was great..very classy looking, though I gave it to my nephew who I thought looking back wouldrather have a sport watch, he seem to like it..."
3,Bitita's Diary,"I enjoyed this novel. It was very educational and related very well to class material. This novel helped to explain ideas such as discrimination by race and class, Latin American Culture, and feminism. My favorite chapter, The Godmothers, is very important to the rest of the novel because gives background into the rest of family. I would recommend this books if you wish to further explore Latin American culture and values."
4,Bitita's Diary,"Bitita's Diary, from Brazil, is an interesting and easy to follow factual book. They way life was for Bitita and her family is so vastly different than my own experience that it helped open my eyes to the world and the ways things are for some people in different places. She writes of her life when she was younger, always being inquisitve and wanting to help her fellow man. She is a bright girl with many grown up thoughts about the world- even if they are stated in a way that a child would express themself. She is a strong woman in a time of great gender, race, and class discrimination. It is a testimonial of her life trials and of the people and way of life surrounding her. Carolina Maria de Jesus spoke out and paved the way for future women by writing this book, even though it was widely criticized at the time. A must read."
5,Unbelievable!!,"The recipes in this book are delicious! It is so refreshing to make dishes that are healthier for our family w/o sacrificing taste or quality. My husband and I take turns making dinner every night and he loves how easy it is to use. He is also a very picky eater and he loves the meals we make. I have been consistently using this book for over a year to make our dinners, and I make one dish a week to take as my lunch for the week. Best thing we ever did!!"
5,THIS GIVES ME A HEALTHIER WAY TO COOK WHAT I LIKE TO COOK.,"A FRIEND OF OURS IS AWARE OF MY HUSBANDS HEALTH PROBLEMS AND HE LENT ME HIS COPY OF THIS BOOK.I READ THE INFORMATION PORTION,IT REINFORCED ALL THE THINGS I HAD LEARNED ABOUT WAYS TO EAT HEALTHY. I LOOKED AT SEVERAL OF THE RECIPIES. THE FOOD IS THE TYPE I LIKE TO COOK AND THE KIND THAT MY FAMILY LIKES TO EAT-THE FAT SUBSTITUTION RECOMMENDATIONS ARE EASY.I FEEL THAT THE NUTRITION SCORECARD WILL BE A GREAT HELP IN BALANCING OUR DAILY DIET. I LIKED WHAT I READ---I AM GOING TO BUY THE BOOK TODAY. I WILL ALSO RECOMMEND IT TO MY FAMILY AND FRIENDS."
2,should be titled the corn starch cookbook,"Haven't made one single recipe as everyone I found appealing by title had corn starch in it. Not a big fan, looking for a variety of simple healthy meals and this just didn't cut it. Wouldn't recommend it if you like fresh ingredients."
5,Have used so often the book is falling apart!,"I bought this book about four years ago and have made many of the recipes. Most are relatively easy and fast (especially the chapter on one-dish meals), and although some ingredients you have to look a little harder to find most are available and a lot are things you probably already have on hand. The Chicken Enchiladas and Garden Vegetable Pizza have become standard family favorites and when served to guests I am often asked for the recipes. Oh, and did I mention that the recipies are low fat? I often forget because they taste so good. So happy that she is coming out with another cookbook - I will be one of the first to buy it!"
5,The cookbook used most often in my kitchen,"Time and again I turn to this cookbook to help me decide what to cook for dinner; it is a gem! There is such a wide variety of dishes that are quick, easy, and tasty. The best thing of all, however, is knowing that they are low in fat. I couldn't live without this book! I love to cook the Greek Penne (adding kalamata olives which increases the fat content, but is oh so yummy) when having guests over because it is delicious, easy, and colorful; everyone asks me for the recipe! This book is a great addition to any cook's library!"
5,THE CD ROCKS,"Hey this is the first single off No Authority's new self titled album. (scheduled to come out around March) It has a great pop beat and is a really fun song. If you like this song you should try to get your hands on ""A girl like you"" which will be released around January 15th 1999!"
5,Can't stop No Authority!..only BSB,well if you like this song then you are going to like the album. my friend susan has heard the entire cd and she swears that it is better than the first. so if she says that no authority is good > then they must!!
4,great value easy installation,"This was very easy to install,the only tip I can give is when you have to twist the wires togather use a drill or screw gun it make it much easier and gives you the required twist.I would recommend this to anyone looking to buy a pet fence."
3,Difficult to use...,"We bought the product after our small breed dog continued to get out, which in turn annoyed the living daylights out of our neighbors and their dogs. We had our yard man install it and lay it out. It worked for a while, until the other yard man cut the wire with the weed eater. After he cut it again, we installed it. If you have another dog who isn't as big of an escape artist as the other dog is, this product can be useless. My other small dog (smaller than my usual ring tailed tooter) was able to chew the wire for the other one and let him escape. The receiver/collar is too large for small dogs. I have never had much success with this product. They should make the wire a bright color so people with low intellect can see the wire and not destroy it. I wasn't too happy with it, my dog's are still escaping."
5,I LOVE THIS SERIES,"I love this series. It is one of my very favorites on TV. I have watched every episode of both season one and two. There is much food for thought in every one. I am hoping for a third season, but thus far, have heard nothing about one."
4,Food for Thought,"Decoded investigates many interesting topics and is not too preachy. They supply the information, offer their opinions but allow you to decide what you think"
4,Cool Show,I enjoyed the show so much I decided to add a trip to Mount Rushmore to my bucket list.I've enjoyed most of the decoded shows I've watch
1,Complete nonsense,"I have now watched several of these episodes including the one on the Vatican conspiracy and the Devil's Graveyard. I live in Alaska and I can tell you that what they discuss is made up nonsense. The worst part about watching these episodes for is the over the top pretend shock in every episode. The camera pans to one or all of the cast members as they acted all shocked and surprised at the utter nonsense they have just ""uncovered"". There will always be people who want to buy into conspiracy theories no matter how stupid they may sound.Please don't think you are going to watching anything even remotely akin to a legitimate investigation of the subject matter. This people are just finding nut jobs that will go on TV and validate their conspiracy."
3,not much decoding.,A lot of talk. With little being decoded. An excellent historical investigation. But to much conspiracy theory stuff. Not enough mystery being solved.
5,I didn't think there was anything new in the galaxy.,"Czerneda seems to have done it again. Many have written books about ""shapeshifters"", but none like this! The story is compelling, and at times, leaves you breathless. There's a new surprise around every corner, as Es transforms from one alien form to another to accomplish her mission. Once again, Czerneda has produced strong characters that leave you feeling you would like to find out more about what makes them tick. Unique alien lifeforms, captivating settings, and a sprinkle of humor in just the right places. I'd love to see what the latest ""morphing"" technology could do with Es and her ever-changing body!"
5,Something Truly Remarkable,"In her WebShifter series, Julie manages to do something truly remarkable; she avoids the use of gratuitous sex, violence, language and implied vulgarity that so many contemporary SF novels rely on to drive sales. Rather than try to shock or disgust you, she lets Esen's marvelous ""voice"" take you through the story and use your imagination to fill in the details. The plot isn't earth shattering, but there are more than enough intriguing races (Panacia, Kraal, Lanivarian, etc., - not to mention Es's own species!), character interactions and imaginative details that you can't help but sit back and enjoy the romp. Esen is incredibly alien, all the while having an emotional element that is so human, it's hard not to like her.This is the first book in a long time I'd happily recommend to teenagers, let alone other adults. Bravo, Julie! Give me more!"
3,Has all the ingredients of a space opera adventure,"Upgrading my initial assessment of the book. It has all the components for an enjoyable read: new interesting aliens, danger, mystery, chase through space. However, it struck me as a light-weight adventure romp, not as rich as, say, Czerneda's ""Survival,"" which I loved.This novel aims to be a hard SF/space opera novel, but there's no physics to qualify as hard SF, there isn't enough (practically none) world-buildling to be space opera. And no romance to saving grace. It's not really a character novel, either. So what is it? It's readable, just unfulfilling."
2,Beholder's Eye,"I got only through the first 50 pages of this before giving up. Though the idea of shapechangers is interesting, I found the sentence-level writing plodding and the character not alien enough for what she's supposed to be--the disgusting bits at the beginning notwithstanding. Her psychology seems human, and that doesn't work for me in this context.The plot didn't draw me in either. However, it's only fair to point out that other readers enjoyed the book."
3,Put Me Through Too Many Changes,"This book had likeable characters and a good writing style, but the plot was too strung out for my tastes. It was almost written like a serialization, where you go from place to place to place but there is no building momentum to a crescendo. I did feel it was consistent in the science and the characterizations were in-depth and believable, but it could have been shorter and more economical in the story-telling and it would have been more powerful."
4,great spy car!,this is a great spy tool. pros and cons belowpros:*fast*durablecan go over SMALL obstocalescons:*limited view* hard to manuver* battery runs out in 15 minites
3,Disappointed,"I purchased this toy for my grandson. He likes it, but one of the features was to have been a see-in-the dark-mode with an ifrared sensor. This feature was not installed on the vehicle."
4,Birthday present for grandson,"My soon to be nine year old grandson had only one request from me for his birthday....the spy robot car. ""But,"" he told me, "" how much can you spend....they are [...]!"" He was pretty close to correct and I try to keep my birthday gifts for 9 grandchildren at around [...]. When I started looking for the product on line, it was over [...] everywhere except Amazon. I got it for closer to [...]. I was pleased and he was thrilled with his gift."
5,fantastic toy,"I have now bought 3 of these, 2 for grandchildren and 1 for my daughter of second marriage. The children are absolutely thrilled with them, and mums and dads keep wanting to play. It's VR with reality, way better than a simple remote controlled car or any on-screen simulation. As an engineer I was impressed with the quality - solid and rugged though heavy but that's the price you pay for solid engineering. It uses rather a lot of batteries but it's worth it. The packing is excellent too - items actually screwed into the pack rather than tied. A lot of thought has gone into every aspect. Excellent value for money."
4,"Great fun, more than just an RC car!","This was what my son wanted more than anything this year. He wasn't disappointed. I wouldn't say this is the best RC car I have ever seen, but the video works fine (black and white). The screen is small, but you are looking at it with one eye. It's a little hard to control at first, which is understandable. I've had RC cars that had better control. This one seems to be geared toward stealth, it is a Spy Car after all, and has a quiet motor for a kid's toy. The fun is getting a peek at people remotely, and attempting to navigate out of situations by video. There's no sound, which would have been nice, but who can complain? As long as this thing doesn't break on us soon, I give it 4 out of 5 stars."
1,Save your money,"My son received this for Christmas. The first car would not even move or shoe that it even had power. The replacement that was sent was without the night vision (which was on the first car). but it did moved in about 1/2"" jerks. Never smooth and the eye peice was nothing but ""white"". I gave up and requested a refund. My son has been terribly disappointed. I called Wild Planet for 2 weeks before I received a response 1 week after my last call. All the tech reviews of this product were positive. I guess I just got a ""lemon"" evidently 2 of them."
3,No more secrets,My daughter asked for this last year. We were very excited over the price. It was very short lived though. She may have played with it 4 times over the last year. So unless your kid really loves remote control things pick something else.
1,disappointed,"I bought this spy car for my grandson. My son put the batteries in the car and it started smoking and smelled like burning rubber. Boy, am I disappointed."
2,Too pricey,"The cost is more than it is worth. Grandma bought it for my son for Christmas. He played with it for two days then it went in the closet and still sits there today. The technology was cool, but my son got bored with it fast."
1,Performs miserably,"I suffer from voyeuristic obsessions that my psychologist says borderlines on the psychotic. Anyway, when I saw this advertised, I thought it would be a very effective way for me to spy on my family and neighbors. Boy, was I disappointed! While the product works properly (sending a wireless feed from the camera in the car to the viewfinder), as an actual tool for spying, it is practically useless. I was instantly ""made"" by my intended targets within seconds of my initial field tests. Boy, were they angry!I think the biggest flaw in the design (what gave me away) is the presence of a remote controlled car with a camera mounted on it. My targets figured out right away that they were being observed from a remote location. Maybe if they made the car really, really small, it would work better."
3,It's cool....but..........,"It's great concept for a toy. There's a few issue's that I found personally. First of all it's supposed to be a ""spy"" car, when it moves its a little nousy not loud but noisy. If I was sitting in a room I could hear it coming. Second, the car doesn't have much of a range on it. I would say a good 15ft. which ain't much in the R/C world. The car starts to get a little glitchy through walls. Once again going back to the ""spy"" aspect of it. If i'm spying I would like to be able to stay out of sight. I think they should do a little more work on this toy and it would be a awesome toy."
1,Foreigner: 25 All Access Tonight,This has to be the WORST concert / music documentary dvd that I have ever watched. The camera and editing work must have been done by a ten year old. The sound quality is terrible. I watched it only once (and not all the way thru) and it now sits collecting dust. To me it was the biggest waste of music money that I have spent. I would sell it for $5.00 if I thought I could !PS: Couldn't find a zero star rating... sorry !
3,lame,"i was really psyched to see this; i never saw a whole foreigner show but i saw them in 1988 at the atlantic records concert and they kicked ass.the production is sub-par, especially compared to tons of recent old re-releases (see dio sacred heart).lou gramm just can't hit any notes...the worst was juke box hero. terrible, noone objective could say otherwise.but- i will say that mick jones was fabulous, and i believe,even makes watching this dreadfull spectacle a somewhat enjoyable experience. have some wine.i am looking forward to seeing the deer creek show."
1,Save your money...,Seems like Mick Jones had to drag poor Lou Gramm with his ailing vocal performance just to make a quick buck in case Lou's health got worse. I could have hung in there but using one camera to shoot the whole DVD made it even boring to watch let alone listen. And I use to love Foreigner. Shameful.
4,"Thank you, liveshows13 from Chicago, IL","Thanks for writing a review I could read and base my purchase on.The first reviewer had an affection for the CAPS LOCK key and hated periods. The second didn't use one capital letter and also hated periods. Yours was worth the read and was right on the money. I wish Amazon would reject some of these unreadable reviews..it is the English language and with a band like ""Foreigner"", I would think you are at least in your 30's or over like myself. You think people would be a bit more conscience on how they type. This is why you can preview your review first.Although I have seen worse! Anyway, ""Liveshows13"" was a great review and I really enjoyed this DVD."
5,just what i wanted!,Had looked for watch with mesh band and this was a perfect choice. service and quality both great!!!
5,A Must Buy for anyone who loves True Rock and Roll!,"I have been a Simon Townshend fan since his first album in the 1980's. Simon has a wonderful voice than can span a large range. The songs on ""Among Us"" are extremely well written. The listeners will soon find themselves singing along to the songs such as ""The Way It Is"" and ""When She Sleeps""!"
4,The best mainstream pop can offer,"After experimenting with electronic pulses and blips absorbed in lush string sound, Darren Hayes has finally returned to the sound that made him famous. I've been waiting for it since Spin was released in 2002... Pretentious ideas aside, it's a great pop track you can't help but sing along to. And what stands it aside from the rest of the bunch is his sincerity and emotional pull. Don't try to reinvent the wheel, Darren, your old one serves you so well!"
4,A nice camp shirt,"This has been my goto shirt for summer time Friday happy hour. It has a relaxed look, but can also be worn to the office. It can wrinkle, so pull it out of the dryer and hang right away or have it professionally cleaned and pressed."
4,Elite Double Platinum Two Ball Roller,"Excellent quality bag. Well constructed with good padding around and between bowling balls. Plenty of pocket space and room for shoes, towels and other bowling essentials. The price was outstanding and the bag well worth it."
2,Not impressed,"Bag seemed nice at first, but zipper teeth on shoe compartment broke within first 2 months. Handle seems rickety when fully extended and the locks dont keep the handle from retracting when pulling and pushing bag around. Would not buy again."
4,Insightful and well-researched!,"This book presents valuable insights into post-gulf war Iraq and the political intricacies of Saddam’s regime. Given the recent major terrorist incidents, the study of Iraq and its dictator holds great relevance. Iraq had used chemical weapons against Iran and the Kurds, and was known to have ambitious programs to build a biological, chemical and nuclear arsenal. Thanks to the UN sanctions, its economic prowess has been significantly weakened. Otherwise, it could be both a formidable terror state as well as resource-rich sponsor of terrorism worldwide. But an Iraq under Saddam cannot be underestimated; it is and has always been a very real threat. What should be US’s policies towards this rogue state? Well, read this book and maybe you would have formed some answers in your mind."
2,Great Facts but Poor Presentation,"This book was so full of facts, including detailed names of an entire chain of people involved in Iraq that the meaning and overall picture got lost in all the detail. I started to wonder if all these statements of fact were actually correct or just the authors opinion. This book is not for the average person seeking to learn more about Sadam and the Gulf War. I would say it's more of an historical reference or scholarly textbook, provided the statements presented as facts can be verified, and not appropriate for a leisurely read on the beach.I would summarize my point as saying the author seems to be knowledgeable about Iraq and the US government but a very poor story teller."
4,Revealed: Survival Secrets of the Thief of Baghdad,"If you've ever wondered why the recent history of Iraq plays like a bad case of deja vu, you need look no further for the answers. A chronicle of misstep, miscalculation and missed opportunites on all sides, the authors move briskly through the four decades of Saddam and his ruling clique, pausing at each coup attempt along the way to regale us with anecdotes both tragic and comic. The Cockburns have delivered a concise, illuminating and entertaining primer on America's favorite bogeyman."
4,A compelling case for finishing the job,"The strongpoint of ""Out of the Ashes"" is the compelling argument it makes for the US/U.N. to have ""finished the job"" in 1991 and driven Saddam Hussein out of power. However, the authors in addition to portraying the human cost for not having done so, present the argument for why it couldn't be done in deference to our Arab ""allies."" The rest of the book chronicles life in 1990s Iraq under an isolated dictator who was responsible for the physical destruction of his country. The battle over U.N. inspections also features prominently. This all makes for very compelling reading and the authors have told their story well."
5,freesyle pro,"This is an excellent, very versatile piece of equipment. The initial set up takes a little time and it is helpful to go to the web and get additional information beyond what is shown in the inclosed DVD. Once this is done, however, there is essentially no set up needed for subsequent use. The accompanying DVD contains many exercises for all ability levels (and many more can be found on line) for upper body, lower body and core, and it is good for stretching as well. It is fun to use and is well worth the price!"
5,A wonderful album and a must have for Barry Gibb fans!!!,"This is a great album. I remember watching the album video back in the 80's when I worked a video store and enjoyed the artistic presentation along with the music. Each song flows very well to the next. It's hard to pick out favorites as I enjoy the entire album. This is definitely a must have album for Barry Gibb fans.By the way, if you're going digital with your music collection, check out ITunes. You can download the entire album for $4.99. An absolutely AWESOME deal!"
3,Basically BeeGees,"This is a pretty good solo album of Barry singing in his usual BeeGees voice. Shine Shine was a hit in 1984, I remember when it aired for a few weeks on FM radio. I bought the vinyl album that same year because I am a huge BeeGees fan. The CD version is out of print now and almost impossible to find. I think some of the songs are pretty good, but not nearly as good as any of the BeeGees albums. All in all, If i could get this on CD, I would certainly buy it."
5,Underrated classic,"This album is an underrated, overlooked gem. The songs are great and BG's voice is in great form."
4,Most funny and comical novel,"This novel ""Midsummer's Knight"" is so comical that I stayed up intel dawn reading every word. I was so shocked that the men in this book actually dressed in the wedding gowns of their wifes for the King. I have now read this book at least twenty times since I had it."
2,A Shakespearean Wannabe,"Yes, the plot is entertaining but the writing is ennervating. This outright attempt to immitate Shakespeare is ANNOYING! It is a ripoff in plot and language, and if I really wanted to read Shakespeare, I would have picked one of his plays or sonnets to read and not this book I wish I had been forewarned. If you enjoy medieval books, skip this one."
5,Great Drill,"I've owned a Makita which is a good product and Porter Cable which is also a good product, but this Bosch is by far more solid than the others. It feels reliable and has the right balance. PLenty of torque and speed for all jobs. Would be nice to have more torque settings and NMIH batteries but it's still my drill of choice."
3,TV's Golden Age,Wilk takes readers back to the more innocent days of when television was in its infancy and creativity was the only way to develop ideas because there were no precedents to follow. The pioneers of the medium were the first to pave the way. In a sense there is a taste of that adventuresome spirit in the trial-and-error period of the internet. New ideas are being tested. Looking back at how television developed in the 1950s causes one to realize the principles of creativity are consistent regardless of the method of communication.
4,Dad loved it!,I got this as a gift for me dad and he loved it! The item was what it said it would be and delivery was very fast. Kinda wish is was a different fabric but not sure what kind.
2,Learned my lesson,I bought this CD last night at Best Buy and when I got home and played it was shocked to find out these songs are remakes. If I had read the reviews on amazon.com like I usually do I wouldn't have wasted my money.I felt I was listening to a live Las Vegas show. The CD case is not forthcoming about this. I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 because the recording had pretty good musical fidelity. This CD will be relegated to a drink coaster after I purchase a CD with original recordings on Amazon.Weldon Schott
2,What are you looking for ?? Paul Anka's Best Songs are on.....,"Dear Reviewers,I love Paul Anka's music -- both the early and more recent music. I have gone to his showin Westbury Theatre in Long Island 3 times. He is the BEST entertainer. He has written well over 500 songs for some of the greatest singers.Why consider this CD when you could get: 1) 30th Anniversary Compilation and 2) Body of Work, both superbCD's.IM Dr. Danny Kopec, Merrick, New York"
4,A welcomed addition,"I give this DVD a 9 as I feel the Australia DVD is still the best out of all the Andre Rieu presentations. If Carla M. had at least one song on the DVD I would have given the program a 10. Still, the program is a welcomed addition to any musical collection."
5,Total Enjoyment,Enjoyed every minute!! We will watch this many times through the coming years! Have watched it a couple of times with different guests and they have all loved it!
5,Excellent!,"I purchased this DVD when it was on pre-order, and it shipped out the very next day after it was released. I received it on time and it was a gift for my mom since she is a huge Andre Rieu fan. She thought by far, out of all his previous releases this was the best.Amazon is always reliable and on time :-) I will definitely be ordering more releases in the future."
1,The Lawerence Welk of Classical Music,"Nice production values, and if you're a fan of schmaltz-y, hammed-up classical, then I'm sure you'd love this. If you're a fan of classical music, skip it and get something by one of the great symphonies, like the LSO, BSO, CSO, etc."
5,Best Wedding present,The scenery and the music are both wonderful. What a beautiful setting for a concert and I'll bet the newlyweds will always remember their wedding day. The concert included some of Andre's usual song picks and the Barber of Seville piece was musical humor at its best.
4,"Excellent intrigue, easy reading and historically accurate","As a medieval history buff, I tend to go into Historical Fiction with a large amount of skepticism. In this case, the author has done a fantastic job with the facts, the people of the time and the story line.The writing is excellent, I was brought to tears, laughter and heartache. If you are a history buff, you , too will enjoy the accuracy and pains that the author has gone to while reading a good adventure.I enjoyed the book so much that I intend on making it a permanent member of my personal library."
3,"Not exactly a page-turner, but a decent read","The book was not exactly a page turner, but it did have an interesting storyline. I was a bit hesitant in purchasing this book, because it is the author's debut novel, and recently I have a read a few debut novels that were pretty bad. This book is better than most debuts, but I did not find it extraordinary. The adventure the main character embarked upon was enjoyable to follow - and the story had enough twists and turns to keep me entertained. I'd recommend this book to someone who is interested in the specic time period, but not to anyone who is looking for a good historical mystery page-turner."
3,Entertaining but predictable,"The Canterbury Papers was an entertaining read because there is continuous movement. The historical setting is good but sometimes the descriptions of furniture get too much. The characters are well drawn. I have to give a thumbs-down to the predictability of the story. It's great to drop hints regarding the mystery but in this story, it's so obvious. Another thing I didn't like was the way Alaise would enumerate what she did using then...and then. But I did like the happy ending for Alaise who despite being a princess, didn't exactly have a fairy tale life/"
4,"Light, fun, surprisingly sweet","This is no sweeping historical epic, and as a mystery, it's not exactly groundbreaking in terms of plot. However, this is a fast, entertaining, intelligent read. While it's not a ""romance novel"", the love story it contains is quite touching. It's nice to think of a medieval woman--a fictional one, at least--overcoming the prejudices and pitfalls she faced due to her gender, and bravely making a satisfying life for herself."
3,The Canterbury Papers,"This historical novel is well plotted but a little dreary to read, at times. Not the best but certainly not the worst. Gets better as you move further into the story."
4,Good historical fiction,"Historical fiction with a captivating plot and characters. I especially enjoyed the author's similes such as "" my sins.... strung out like dark pearls in the years behind me"" and "" memory is like an old parchment on which the writing has faded so much that a scribe can use the scroll again""."
2,Yawn...,"Thank heavens I purchased this book with a gift card and didn't waste my own money. I found ""The Canterbury Papers"" to be disappointingly two-dimensional. There is a treasure trove of background upon which the author can draw, and many vibrant historical figures that can really sizzle in print. Unfortunately, the author glosses over this and leaves her portrayal of the era as a colorless and drab as a black and white comic strip. Readers who enjoy beautifully depicted settings are better off reading Rosalind Laker or Judith Merkle Riley. Also, the plot was hopelessly predictable. I was able to see the author's plot twists chapters before they were revealed. To me, the ""mystery"" of the book was that I managed to finish it at all."
3,this was ok,"I kept waiting for it to get better, and there weren't any characters I really felt sympathetic to."
1,This product had no effect on my symptoms.,I went through a whole bottle as directed on it's label for proper dosage and my symptoms did not go away now I'm stuck with the other bottle I bought. Maybe it's just me because not everything can work for everyone but this did not work for me at all.
1,Software did not work,The software did not work. I do not remember who sold this product and cannot sent it back.
3,Its a love story,Thought it was an action story but its more of a love story. I guess If it was an action story id have liked it more
5,Worth your money.,"I heard this CD played in a restaurant/club in Prague a few weeks ago and had to ask who it was; I ate there three days later and they were kind enough to play it again for me. It's a very smooth album, something you'd want to play softly during a dinner party or loudly, speakers turned out the window, as you're lying in the backyard getting a tan. It's sort of R&B, sort of trippy, with great beats. The song ""Sail"" is also on HedKandi's Serve Chilled 2 compilation, which is another worthwhile buy. Looking forward to the release of this album, any day now."
1,Still not buying....,"When most TV shows are being released in entire season sets, DYNASTY is still being released in volumes, even making the consumer wait a year between volumes. Not only is this ridiculous, it is not smart considering today's economy. Since I may have to choose what I want to spend my money on, I will continue buying DALLAS and FALCON CREST for the price of one DYNASTY half set! I'll keep watching this one on Netflix..... I am happy for those that can shell the dough, not to mention wait 14 years to see the last volume of the last season. I, for one, pass."
4,The Saga continues...,The only bad thing about the Dynasty DVDs is they are released so freaking slow! At this pace I have the complete series in 2020! Who doesn't love Ms. Collins as the sum of motherly love and kindness (Alexis). Definitely a role model!
5,"I love the show, quit splitting up seasons and bring 'em out faster","I love Dynasty, as my mom got my name from the show. It's nice to watch them with her. I don't like that they decided to split seasons in 2 volumes, and then it taking so long for them to be released. I want the entire collection and quicker the better. It's more enjoyable. I forgot what happened in the last half and now have to rewatch it to catch up because it's been almost a year. I am glad they're on DVD though =) I bought my copy of this from Walmart as I was too impatient to wait for shopping through Amazon."
3,I had just about given up!!!!!!!!!!!!,Well its about time!!!!!! I was seriously giving up on Dynasty. Its been so long since the release of vol. 1 of season 4. Im glad that Paramount is still releasing Dynasty but I wish they would stop releasing it in volumes and just release it in full seasons. At this rate we wont finish the series for years to come. We are only up to season 4????????? I mean we have like 5 more seasons to go. I guess Dallas is way more popular and that show lasted for like 13 years and they are almost finished releasing it all. Paramount please consider releasing the rest of Dynasty in full seasons. People will buy it. But if u keep doing it this way then people will get sick and tired and not buy anything!!!!!!!!
5,Guilty Pleasure,"Season 4 is one of my favourite seasons, i was looking forward to the arrival of Dominique and the storyline leading up to poor Alexis getting thrown in the slammer! I was fortunate enough to buy this season as a whole here in New Zealand without it being split into volumes. I've now just ordered Season 5 (released on August 5th here) and it should arrive in the post next week, so i'm really looking forward to seeing Amanda Carrington! Definitely recommend Season 4!"
4,SOLID AS A ROCK,"This gauge is easy to set up and easy to position. You may have to make a few adjustments to true it all up but, when your finished this thing is rock solid.The T-track system allows you to extend your gauge well beyond the edge of your table for larger pieces.Made with a combination of aluminum and steel this thing is built to last.I do recommend coating the bar with a dri-cote type product if rust is a concern. Now get out there and cut some miters."
3,Unknown - wrong?,"This book is a good look through the different works that the legend James Dean produced. But there is not a great deal of information on rebel himself, off-screen. If you're wanting to know what Jimmy Dean was in, and what the critics said about him then this is a good buy."
5,Definately Yes!!,"Okay, he's from Costa Rica, grew up in New York and can't stop his love affair with flamenco, latin rhythms and percussion. With this mix of influences it isn't hard to find yourself captivated with Carranza's latest release, Playa Gitana (Gypsy Beach). An excellent and ambitious follow-up to his previous work on Flamenco De La Costa. Don't take this guy's guitar away, but I've read in an interview that if he were stranded on a desert beach and his last string broke, he'd just keep playing his guitar like a drum. Gotta love that!"
2,Strongly not recommended!,"consumes a lot of battery, lasts for a maximum of 2 hours when you insert fully charged batteries in it. does not detect many MP3 cds, almost half of my MP3 CDs could not be played in this. bulky, cannot use as an MP3 walkman but good if you use standard MP3 CDs and always keep it connected to the AC outlet."
2,dun like,This thing has a mind of its own! one day it will work great and I would be very pleased with it but then the next day it will skip and just randomly turn off when the batteries are full. Also this thing uses batteries so fast! I think I'm either going to get a RioVolt or a TDK Mojo instead and chuck this piece.
3,Not as good as I hoped it would be.,"I first became acquainted with Shirley Bassey's voice when I sent to see ""Goldfinger"" back in the 1960's. Over they years I came across references to her name; and a short time ago I bought this retrospective of her work. This lady has a very fine voice, but I found her back-up arrangements so dated and so lacking in class, that I finished listening to this production feeling rather cheated and deprived. If I could turn back time, I would shout to myself ""Don't buy it! Don't buy it!"""

1,The worst thing i ever heard!,"These guys are really incredible! Alexandre Pires, the singer, is getting worse each day, specially in this awful album. His spanish is terrible! He claims himself to be a samba singer, but what one can listen to in this CD is an american pop-style with disgusting cliches of the Latin America culture. Gloria Estefan did the most stupid thing of her life in participating in this recording. The first track gets on my nerves! I promiss you'll hate them too as soon as you hear this album!"
4,Great insight into a complex individual,"This book provides great insight into a very complex person who both entices and offends at the same time. The passion with which Swaggart enfolds his flock is enhanced by his great talent as a singer, not unlike the way Tammy Fae was able to reach out to her ex-husband's audience. Swaggart is indeed very much like Jerry Marcus' ""Salvation Peddler,"" Jason Blake, who embodies Swaggart's passion, but provides readers with a view of televangelists' impact on their families as well as their followers."
1,Regional Error,When I bought this movie I was expecting to be able to watch it. When it arrived at my home my family and I sat down to watch it as you would a new movie. But instead of watching a great movie the only message I recieved on my screen was Regional Error 1. I was sent a movie that isn't coded for the USA. What a let down. If this movie was coded for another country it should've been included in the description. I won't order from this company again... ever.
5,The Ghost who walks on your DVD player,"Excellent film whether or not you've read the books, comics or seen the 1943 Serial or not. I have only have 1 question. The DVD version seems to be a bit of an effort to get started. I don't know if it's a manufacturer's defect or my bad luck. Will follow this up by e-mail to anyone who reads this review and wants a follow up."
4,An underrated Phantom,"The Phantom plays it awfully close to the origianl 30's strip and, sadly, sailed right by the viewers looking for something louder and nastier than a skull ring and a dog sidekick. Having said that, I highly recommend the movie to anyone with a longtime affection for The Ghost Who Walks. It's a shame they stopped after one."
3,Mr. Walker!,"Oh Ghost Who Walks! What way to kill a potential series. Zane is great as the Phantom. However, they should have stuck to his origins as written by the creator and not come up with a weak ""rule the world"" with mystic skulls story. It would have been more exciting to see how he gave up fame and love to become the Phantom when his Father died....and to explain his ""Mr. Walker"" alter ego...not to mention his other traits and qualities."
2,WARNING! The Phantom Blu-Ray Disc is Region-Coded,"The Review is for the Product, not the movie itself, so here's the truth of the matter : This Blu-Ray Disc will only play on BRD Players that are Region A ONLY.That's to say if you live outside of the USA and was looking to import it, you're out of luck - It will Play on Region A Players only."
2,The Phantom,Just like the first one I ordered this one will also not load and play. So now I have a movie I can't watch.
3,Yes its purple.,"Billy Zane portrays the Phantom as a confident, masculine, buff hero, clad in the silliest costume seen on film since Howard the Duck. The story is entertaining, reminiscent of the serial comics from which the original Phantom sprung. Good supporting cast with Kristy Swanson and the always-entertaining Treat Williams. Billy Zane of course went on to bigger roles (and better costumes) in Titanic and Cleopatra, but he seems to truly be having fun here. Well worth watching, if you can get past the purple suit."
4,well done movie,It is based on the comic strip character. It is well done and produced. They did an excellent job on it.
4,The Phantom,Seller did a good job with fast shipping. Excellent movie and kid appropriate which is what I was going for. Thanks./
1,YEEEEESSSHHHHHH,"Well this was a stinker. I know that Zane probably needed a change in pace from his typical bad guy roles, but he is so much more entertaining in those very roles. This movie has a very used plot that worked well in Superman and the first two Batman movies. This is so boring and unappealing one wonders if children could enjoy this movie. Zane is excellent though in his performance. He just needed a better script."
1,not worth the time,"Indian Jones meets 1960's batman... ie Indian Jones in tights. Worst line in the movie ""There is no smoking in the Skull Cave"" said by the phantoms butler whilst standing infront of a roaring fire... not to mention the various tourches around the cave being used to light the place."
1,The Phantom -- Billy Zane,"This product was useless. The North Carolina company sent to me (in Texas) a region 2 PAL video. None of my 5 DVD readers can process it. I'm sure I should have been aware of the region stuff, but I have never encountered the problem before. I feel used..."
1,Poor,"I was not impressed with the quality of this DVD when I received it about two weeks ago. It said that you had to play it in a certain type of DVD player, whatever you do do not buy anything through Rarewaves-imports."
3,An Indiana Jones wannabe...,"... but that's not necessarily a bad thing. After all, ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" is one of the greatest adventure movies of all time. There's quite a bit of ""Raiders"" in 1996's ""The Phantom""; it's just no where as good. Even the three Indiana Jones sequels are better. But it's not bad either.Billy Zane shines in the title role -- charming and in absolute perfect shape -- while Kristy Swanson and Catherine Zeta-Jones offer their feminine charms to the mix, not to mention Samantha Eggar. Also on hand are James Remar, Treat Williams and Patrick McGoohan.""The Phantom"" is just a fun, cartooney adventure that takes place mostly in the jungle, with some parts in the big city. It's great for a night when you're in the mood for some light viewing.The film runs 100 minutes and was shot in Thailand, Australia and California.GRADE: C+"
4,worth giving a try,I originally saw it at the cinema and there was only one other person watching. Billy Zane was excellent the effects and story absorbing. Deserved better promotion. It at least treated a comic book hero with respect.
5,the phantom,"Billy zane playing the phantom was good ,remaking A movie set to look like 1930's america.The action parts were good but using A real wolf I think was A bit dicey."
1,Rip off,"This DVD is not for the US. When inserted into the DVD player, an error message of Wrong Region appears. Recommend do not buy."
4,My boys picked this out and we all loved it,"Ok , so this isn't the best movie ever made , it's still one slam bang adventure movie that even though it has some places that might not be kid friendly, is still a great family action movie. Billy Zane and Kristy Swanson make a nice couple and Treat Williams is one bad guy that you can't wait to see get what he should. All in all a very good , but not great action movie for the whole family"
4,(IN)DIANA AND THE PHANTOM,"This picture was ignored by most critics and few people saw it on the theaters here in Brazil. But it is a very good action movie. It has the spirit of Indiana Jones films, as it takes places in distant places, in a deep forest, it has a lot of mystic in the air and it happens during the II WW. The scenes of fight and action are very exciting and the famous super-hero seems to move very fast. Billy Zane is perfectly cast in the title role. Kristy Swanson was very beautiful and charming in her first movies, but seems to be loosing her attraction. The role of Diana here should have been played by gorgeous and athletic villain Catherine Zeta Jones, whose hair is even similar to the comics character (later she would appear in another comics character, ""Zorro""). One of the reasons for the good production is the presence of Joe Dante as Executive Producer. He now could film the story of the honeymoon of the Phantom, which would be a great hit."
3,The Ghost who walks!,"Comic book adaptions are a mixed bunch. Some are excellent (Batman), some are good (Superman) and some are just awful (The Shadow). And the first outing for the purple-masked ""ghost who walks"" rests somewhere in the middle. The premise is taken directly from Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (1984), with rugged expolorers with fedoras searching for 3 mystical stones that possess an incredible power, including one set-piece where our hero is trapped on a rope bridge, and you start to wonder if Indy himself will show up to save the day. However hackneyed the plot may be, however, it is fun, and there are just enough good action scenes and impressive effects to cover the film's flaws. Billy Zane as the title character, fits into the role suprisingly well, and you leave the film feeling satisfied, regardless of it's faults. Not the best superhero movie, but a solid additon to the genre."
5,An underrated gem!,"I never understood why this movie wasn't a success.I remember seeing the trailer and really getting pumped for it,I've probably seen over 15 times.Billy Zane is one of those actors who is great but never really took off,and look out for Treat Williams who is a delight as the villanious businessman,and Catherine Zeta-Jones is hot as ever as the leader of the female air-pirates.If you're looking for a fun,fast-paced actioner for the whole family,then the Phantom is the one you're looking for!"
3,The Phantom Review,"This product was a fun movie, take it for what it is, as an entertaining movie not meant to have the highest quality acting and screenplay. Good fun and light and entertaining."
3,good movie but could have been better,"i liked the movie but i wish it was done on a grander scale sort of a like the old b movies of the hollywood golden era like ex. indiana jones. I luved the city set pieces i thought they were awesome but the jungle scenes were a little lax, i wish they would have used the old ""darkest africa"" notion in the film because you have to admit around that time period africa was largely uncharted .I think billy zane was great in the role but i wish the movie had a lot more to it, it had so much promise but all in all a good movie ."
1,Very small,"This falls into the category of not worth the effort to send back since the shipping is almost as much as the product. This hat runs VERY small. My 6 year old son has a smallish head and it fits just barely on top. Yes, it looks a little stupid but he likes it anyway. The zorro costume, however, is pretty great."
5,"To the music fan who called Kylie ""Granny Minogue"":","She ain't that old. She's still in her thirties! But if you wanna be superficial, go right ahead. No one's stopping you (partly because nobody cares).On to the CD:1. Album Version 10/10-Really good. ""Poor man's Beyonce"" my @$$!2. Cruise Control 9/10-Would love to rate this higher, but I can't. A bit too urban for Ms. Minogue.3. Almost a Lover 11/10-Fantastic! Think Spice Girls meets Daft Punk meets electro-lounge.4. Slow (Chemical Bros. Mix) 20,000/10-I LOVE YOU, CHEMICAL BROTHERS!!! Very awesome to finally have the entire 7:13 mix available.5. Whitey Mix (RBW) 10/10-I applaud Whitey. They did a great job, just like for Princess Superstar's ""Coochie Coo"".A great buy!"
3,Urban-Retro-Funk-Dance.....And Kylie?,"This Maxi-Single is for Club Freaks/Dj's who'll do anything to get their hands on The Chemical Brothers Mix of ''Slow'', I also think it's one of the best remixes ever-- done for Kylie. It's a semi-trance with a laid back & sensually driven beat, with some additional vocals included that don't seem to be Kylie's....It seems to be a looped and deeply computerized voice, some kind of special effect, but a really cool one though. It makes one hell of a club track and also seems to be for more progressive clubs. Plus you get ''Red Blooded Woman'' which is a urban-retro funk song, her voice sounds nice on this track too. AND!? you get a video & gallery too!...What more ya need?."
5,colorful,"love the colors and textures of these kitchen towel, as they perk up the atmosphere; they wash well and are nicely absorbent.Nice to be able to order on line rather than wander through many stores!"
2,Not what they used to be,"I've bought several sets of flour sack towels by Now Designs over the years. I'd always been thrilled, but they seem to have lowered their quality standards. This most recent batch was rough and the threadcount must be a lot lower, because I could actually see holes through the fabric. It was almost like a mesh fabric, not solid cotton. I will be sending these back."
2,"The dish towels faded a lot, and the seams came apart in the first washing.","The dish towels faded a lot, and the seams came apart in the first washing. I don't recommend this product."
2,Towel Set of 3 includes Same Wrong Color x 2,"Accurate for my color scheme is the written description and image of the 2 grey towels in the Now Designs Floursack Set, London Grey - set of 3. This afternoon (08/10/2012) I received 2 light brown color towels in the set (on wrapping is printed label: London Grey). Phone reps. were very helpful in making the arrangements (at no additional out-of-pocket cost to me) to: (1) authorize return of the towel set and (2) ship correct color of the towel set to be delivered tomorrow (08/11/2012). (I'm assuming) the ease of this process included that this item is sold and shipped by Amazon.com. Also note: Included with my purchase of this towel set, I purchased Now Designs Ripple Dishcloths, London Grey which are a true shade of grey. Patiently, looking forward to the completion of this order."
2,Pulled threads & knots and vibrant colors fade considerably.,"There was something wrong with the machine that wove this thread. Many pulls and knots, leaving holes and open lines that track along where the thread is pulled, and seems more on the whites than the colored. While the colors are beautiful, they fade to a dull hue once washed, even on cold setting. Amazon replaced a set, but the replacements also had the same problem."
1,terrible,"If I have ever written a review before, it has not been a negative one but these demand a warning; perhaps the worst product i have ever purchased. This is the second set we have owned. I tought the first set, a gift, was rather flawed, but this set is beyond bad. At least one of the three is not even clost to being squared, very crooked. Some of the side hems were only turned over once, rather than a real hem, so that the edges were ragged even before washing. I don't know who in India is now making these towels but it looks like perhaps a very small child who is forced into labor and either doesn't know or certainly doesn't care about the outcome.While they are inexpensive, you certainly get what you pay for. I paid the same amount for one floursack towel from Rushdesign but now think it was totally worth it."
2,not color I ordered,"I have purchased flour sack towels in the past and they are great for glass. I ordered colors to match my kitchen,red and white. I received blue and green. I will keep them as it costs to ship them back but am dissapointed I did not receive the right colors."
4,A Bit of Celtic Infused into Christmas Tunes,"Over fifty minutes of acoustic holiday music. Although the instruments like penny whistle, bagpipes, wooden flute, piano and guitar give a celtic flavor on some tunes (Angels We Have Heard on High), for the most part the feeling was more new age or jazz treatment.The collection contains:I Saw Three ShipsAngels We Have Heard on HighCoventry CarolWe Wish You a Merry ChristmasIn the Bleak MidwinterDeck the HallsAll Through the NightHark, the Herald Angels SingSimple Gifts/When Paddy O'Malley Danced with the Swedish MaidenIt Came Upon a Midnight ClearIn the Bleak Midwinter (reprise)In one song, the overlay of a celtic dance tune with a traditional holiday carol became annoyingly repetitive (Hark the Herald Angels). I love dance tunes, but the unrelenting few bars went on and on without variation and started to grate on me."
4,Great Book for Potential Shop Owners!,"Excellent book for anyone wanting to start a specialty or gourmet shop. Extremely helpful and well thought out information CD is great addition!"""
3,I couldn't start with the information in this book,"While this book tackles a wide range of topics, I don't belive this book would enable the reader to create a business plan. For example the pricing section was more of a conversation on supply and demand rather then standard pricing practices for this niche.I'ld say keep looking."
2,skims the surface,"this book feels like an outline of what the real book would/should be. I suppose it's a good primer on how to gather your thoughts, but shouldn't be confused with a guidance book on opening a gourmet shop."
5,Great sliding miter saw at a bargain price,"I looked at nearly all the sliding miter saws before purchasing this one. The Dewalt 12"" may be slightly better, but it's much larger and costs 50% more. The Porter Cable is nice as well, but there's no way to attach extention/stops to the table (a design flaw in my opinion) and was more $$. The Makita was more money as well, but it did add dual mitering (a feature which I do not need.) The Bosch requires no set up. The only adjustment necessary on my saw was the right table fence was off by 1 or 2 degrees. Operation is flawless--cuts beautifully. Only two complaints: the dust collection bag doesn't work very well (but I don't know how well the other saws would fair, either.) And the depth of cut limiter (for sliding dados) does not have much range--the maximum height off the table is only about 1-1/4 inch. Overall a great saw at an incredible price!"
3,"Good saw, and gets th job done","I used this saw to put a floor down. Not bad, in fact pretty good quality. Doesn't do as much as the Dewalt and the thumb safety can be a small pain. But overall a good piece of machinery. Althogh I prefer the Dewalt, this saw doesn't have the initial kick upward when you turn it on."
4,Great saw but lousy to get repair parts,"Being a rank beginner to woodworking but not to power tools, I purchased this miter saw as a starting point to my woodworking hobby. I needed it to construct the window seat frame in our new log home. After 10 cuts on 2x4's, the switch shorted out on the saw. I contacted Bosch and found a tool supply store who could do the warranty work - simply replacing the defective switch. After 4 weeks, they finally received the switch from Bosch and I was back in business. They stopped carrying Bosch tools because of the delays in getting parts and orders from Bosch. If I had ordered a Makita or Hitachi saw, I would have been repaired in less than a week. I'm glad I bought the saw but it was a toss-up between the other 2 and $$$ was a factor.Beware of repairs for your Bosch tools - be prepared for a long wait for parts."
2,"A little cheap, not made for commercial work","I am a professional cabinet builder, bought this saw in Sept. 2002, and have had trouble with the switch going out. The motor is no longer as powerful as it used to be either. I have bought a Makita now to try out for a few years and am selling this one while it still has a little life. I don't believe this saw is made for commercial work. Note, I have NOT abused this saw, it just has had a lot of use day in and day out."
4,"Good Tool, Bad Shipping",I recieved my order promptly and satisfied with its performance. The only problem I had was the missing work piece clamp. Amazon mads it nearly impossible for me to file a error report. I ended up giving up in fileing the report.
4,Nearly perfect,"I've been a professional highend custom builder for 17 years in which time I've bought several miter saws. There's three things I look for in a good miter saw. Consistancy, accuracy & value. The Bosch 10"" sliding compound miter saw is a top contender in all categories. The only draw back is it's ability to only bevel in one direction. If this is a must have feature then step up to the new Bosch 10"" slider for a few more bucks."
4,"Great Saw, great price, worthy of a couple changes","I bought this saw to be attached to the Delta Universal Stand and on that stand it is a very substantial rig. The saw came out of the box only needing a slight adjustment for bevel.As some have already said, saws cut therefore create dust, and this saw is no different than any of those so don't expect it to be.This is a very smooth running, accurate power tool, though one or two changes would make it better:1)Horizontal handle - I had an old cheap delta saw that had it and it's a GREAT feature.2)Include the out feed supports. I'm tired of manufacturers selling just the basic tool and then selling all the accessories to make the tool fully functional separately.I gave it 4 stars only because 4 3/4 wasn't an option and I think 5 stars is reserved for an item with no criticism.Highly recommend"
1,Started on fire after 4 hours of use,Started on fire after 4 hours of use. I'm now looking up the local service center...... Should have got a Delta or Ridged.
1,Disapointment,"When I bought a Bosch power tool I thought now I have the best. After the first cut with my new sliding compound miter saw I realized I had real clean up problems. Bosch's dust bag absolutely does not work at all. I mean NOT AT ALL! I'm very disapointed with Bosch for putting a saw on the market that blows saw dust and chips everywhere except in the dust bag. The design is the real problem, chips don't stand a chance of going into the dust bag. Bosch has got to know this, but why they continue to produce a dust breathing monster is beyond me. I...hate to use it. Buyers beware..."
2,Bosch 5 Stars ... Shipping Cost : New Amazon feature ??,My friend bought this from Amazon and loved the saw...Only thing he complained about was Amazon charged him Shipping cost.. which used to be free.I would recommend buying at local stores instead of Amazon as beauty of Buying from Amazon is Gone !!!.. they now charge a Shipping fee...Checkout local stores and compare how much you will save before buying from Amazon.
4,Plenty of bang for the buck.,"I'm told this saw has been discontinued. I saw Bosch's new 4410 at a woodworking show and it's one really nice saw, with more features than this (notably the handle, which swivels to wherever your hand feels more comfortable) and it's rumored to have better dust collection. It's also well over five hundred bucks. This one cost me $354 and I'm very happy with it, thank you very much. Yes, even with a shop vac hooked up, it throws sawdust. I'll build a hood. Yes, it only bevels one way. I can flip the board. It's got a nice, solid precision feel to it and it makes sharp clean cuts. It was calibrated right out of the box. It's great for cutting long stock, makes perfect 45's, and it'll slice through a 4x4 and a 2x10. That's what I need. Maybe someday I'll upgrade but this saw is going to serve me just fine for years."
3,It's a pretty good saw,"I had this saw for 5 years now and I am somewhat satisfied with it. I cuts very smoothly and I I love the indents and the wide cutting range of the saw. That said, the dust bag doesn't really work which everyone knows. But the thing that really bothered me was the guard. It uses a ballbearing/cam mechanism in a awkward way and if you use the saw alot, the screw which hold the ballbearing strips out. I had brought it in for repairs once but it didn't last. I had to alter the guard mechanism to get it to work properly. If I had my money back, I would buy a makita 12"" sliding compound. (I used and love that saw)"
4,Saw works nice,"I have used my new saw a few times now and really like the saw. As stated in many of the other reviews, the dust collection system is horrible. I even removed the dust bag and attached a vacuum and still had saw dust all over. I purchased the extensions and a spare clamp with my saw. The spare clamp is not as nice as the one that comes with the saw. The blade that comes with the saw is a quality blade and the overall machine feels and looks sturdy. Bosch put a lot of time and thought into this machine.Great saw at a great price!"
4,"Bosch 10"" sliding compound miter saw","I've had this saw for over six months now and am extremely satisfied. It's very accurate, easy to adjust and is particularly good for cutting crown molding. The blade which comes with the saw is OK for basic stuff, but has excessive tearout. For fine work you'll need a good 80 tooth blade.It's a little awkward for a left-hander at first, but easy to adapt to. The biggest complaint is the dust extraction - the dust bag is almost useless, and hooking a vacuum to the dust port makes no difference: dust shoots straight out the back, hits the frame and disperses in a huge cloud. This makes it impossible to use in a customer's home; if it's a row house, finding a safe, convenient outdoor spot for it can be tricky. Wintertime complicates matters. One reviewer said, so what if it takes an extra hour to clean up - it's a terrific saw. Well, it is a terrific saw, but time is money."
4,She's Weird but DVD is Really Useful,"Jean Welles comes off a little creepy, but the lessons are well-paced, well-explained, and well-organized. Mostly good song choices, too. It would be nice, however, if at some point (I'm currently in Volume 3) she would get to using a pick. Still, it's been a quick acclimation to this kind of guitar playing."
1,I HAVEN'T RECEIVED THE BOOK I BOUGHT,I have already written an email complaining. I bought the book - Beyond Jabes - and it was never delivered. I would appreciate if you guys could send me the book or reimburse the money on my credcard. Thank you so much.
1,Dries to an OIL SHEEN on Laminate Flooring...!,"On 9/28/2010, I sprayed Urine Gone on an area in my laminate floored hallway where one of my pups had an accident. I left it to dry for several hours. Later that evening, I fell at that spot and broke my tib and fib in my left leg and spent the next 36 days in the hospital (and rehab). I am now home in bed for further rehabilitation. I sill cannot put weight on my left leg for another six weeks.Please, please, please...warn against spraying it on laminate flooring. Urine Gone does NOT dry...it becomes an oil sheen. The instructions are not clear on this at all."
1,Didn't work,"I have 100% very light colored wool carpet. The test was fine--no change in color. The dog urine stains I had were barely noticible, but because of the light colored carpet, they did show, and I wanted to remove them completely. I used the product as directed and the stains were much worse. It seemed to have brought the urine color to the surface and left it there. The bottle said to try again, so I did. No change--dark yellow stains that would not brush off. I have now steam cleaned the carpet using a different product, which has reduced to the stain color to nearly what it was before, but it is still obvious enough that I'm going to have to replace the carpet--next time with a stain repellent carpet. I will never use this product again, and I cannot possibly recommend it to anyone. It may work better on synthetic fibers, but my experience was a disaster."
2,Too much,"I must agree here. If you want to hear the who the way the should be heard, I suggest you buy the Live at Leeds CD. Another good thing to get would be the 30yrs Max. R&B tape they have on here. This year The Who is touring and I have seen them twice...THIS YEAR they are amazing. In 89 when they did tommy and in 96 when they did Quad. you would not see the who on stage. You saw 3 members of a great band who just stood up front while 50 people behind them played their music. I would never suggest buying this tape. Your money will be much better spent on the 30yrs tape OR...Pete Townshend is releasing his Lifehouse concert soon on VHS...that will be a buy."
2,Have Some Who With Your 100 Piece Orchestra?,"You can't miss Moon enough during this one. While Phillips is a powerhouse of a drummer, he is too calculating and predictable. And trying to insert your own mark on Who songs is blasphemous. I don't care if it's Jones, Phillips or an entire percussion unit. These drummers can't touch Moon. This should be called the gual concert as Townshend says at the end of this side show. Don't sweat it if you can't get your hands on this. A very poor facsimile of what was the best band ever."
3,I love the Who but I have seen better,"I liked this video but of course i like everything that the who has put out. Musically of course it is great, the band looks good, but they play better without all the other people on stage, the who is best as a 4 or 5 person band, 20 some people on stage is just not for them."
3,The Road Rocks,"Road trips are great. The American vistas are a national treasure. But, I used to feel a nagging disappointment that I could NOT remember my freshman Geology enough to really recognize and appreciate rock formations. Four Roadside Geology books later, the disappointment has eased.This summer we are driving from Texas to Wyoming. We plan to use the book to really appreciate what we see along the way. Then, we will leave the book as a host gift.Want your road to rock? Buy Roadside Geology..."
1,Skip This One!,"Awful. Reads as if it was written in a hurry. Skips over a lot of classic musicmaking in the early '60s to concentrate on Spector's sessions with The Beatles and the murder of Lana Clarkson. Obviously written to cash in on the scandal. Mark Ribowsky's ""He's A Rebel"" and Richard Williams's ""Out Of His Head"" aren't flawless, but they are much better than this turkey."
1,Faked me out,"I purchased this CD as there was one song I wanted on it. I also recognized several of the other songs and liked them. What I didn't know was that none of the songs are by the original artist but instead were recorded by someone trying to emulate the original artist. I bought it because it was relatively inexpensive, beware, you get what you pay for."
2,This book is not about biodynamic gardening!!!,"Having used organic gardening methods for years, I became interested in Rudulf Steiner's BIODYNAMIC farming and gardening methods. I hoped that was the subject of this book. I was very disappointed. Nowhere does it mentions Steiner's methods. It is a good book for beginning ORGANIC gardeners, covering composting, natural pest control, etc."
3,More of a Behind the Scenes Documentary,"For a music video or concert video, this DVD seems quite disarranged. For a behind the scenes, roadie type of look at things, this seems almost perfect. If you want to see traveling in cars to gigs, one note shows, and eating caribu with village elders, then this DVD is for you. Strangely enough, I don't feel any closer to the band, or have a deeper understanding of ""The White Stripes"" after watching this. It might be interesting enough to watch once on Netfl_x, but if your interested in something for your home library I would recommend, ""It Might Get Loud."""
1,Busted Case,The dvd its self was awesome. Im a huge Stripes fan so of course I loved it. The case to the dvd was busted as if someone had droped it and it landed right on the bottom left corner. The plasic and the paper under the plastic was torn as well. I usually never have problems with Amazon. Even the used stuff I have bought from them in the past is almost in near perfect condition. Idk what happened this time?!
5,great doc on a GREAT band,The picture quality on this BD varies depending on how it was shot. But it always looks as good as it can. The sound quality is fantastic and over the movie is excellent.
3,Recommend rent it first,"This is not a concert disc like Under Blackpool Lights. This film follows the two as they tour and most of the songs are cut short. Also, Jack is very annoying. He spends much of the time talking about what others have said about him and the band. Who cares. The negative reviews appear to really get at him. Overall I recommend watching it but I would rent it instead. The songs that are fully shown are really good and it is fun to see how they take on so much more risk than most bands. If you want a concert disc go with Blackpool."
2,Where's the Battle?,"If you are interested in daily life in Austria during the Napoleonic period then there is something here for you, as this novel contains insights on that. However, if you want to know about Wagram, well I keep thumbing through this book and I can't find the chapter on it! It is not a bad book, it just has a misleading title."
1,This is NOT a work of history,This book which I purchased in hopes of finding more info on the battle of Wagram (why would I think it had something to do with that?) turned out to be a turgid and boring novel. Action? No... Plot? There was one. So one point for implementation. Conclusion? I returned it in disgust.
4,Most amusing reading.,I have enjoyed very much reading this book. The topic is fascinating for experts and laymen alike.I have not read any other book about Houdini's death but this is probably the best example of painstaking research and investigation on the subject. The research is very detailed and shows Don Bell's commitment to his mission. That's likely to be the reason why his work unearthed very rare information that had never before seen the light. Highly recommended.
4,Excellent discussions of the masters with brief discography,"This book focuses on the key composers of each age. Dubal spends a lot of time on the artistic development of each composer. He does a good job describing the emotional impact of each of their major works and often provides a quotation from another composer who was impacted by that work. Finally, he provides a list of recommended CDs to get a beginner started in building a collection.One drawback--he spends almost no time analyzing the key elements of a particular composition or how the composer accomplished his purpose with his music. Also, his prose, while beautiful, might be a bit flowery."
4,One of the best live bands today,"If you're a Terror fan you'll love this DVD. It's a full live show from London in Jan. 2006 plus tons of bonus live footage (some w/ sketchy quality), interviews, and the vids for ""Overcome"" & ""Keep Your Mouth Shut."" This is not an astonishing live DVD by any means, but Terror is a great live band, and, if I may be cliche, this is a must-have for Terror fans. The DVD is done by the same people who did Lamb of God - Kiladelphia. It's definitely worth the purchase."
4,Le meilleur groupe du fin des annees quatre-vingt huits!,"Loketo remain for me my most memorable Zairean band from the late 80's, about the time I was a school leaver. However, the album they recorded with Aurlus Mabele ""SOUKOUSS LA TERREUR"" is their finest work."
4,Great book,"I really liked this book. It was thought provoking, though scary at first (who REALLY wants to know how hard a new sibling is going to be for #1?). But once I was going through it all myself, it was really steadying and supportive. The big insight I found was that the adjustment period is years, not days or weeks or even months, and continues to change with each new developmental stage. A really down-to earth, good read for a harried mum."
2,bread and chocolate,"The quality of the DVD was grainy and he sound quality poor. This was worse than one would expect from an original master. The film tself represented the contrast between the well off swiss (chocolate) and the italian and turkish working class (bread) just working to survive. It is classified as a comedy. I would call it a tragedy. The Haydn quartet - opus 3 number 5 - the serenade, provides a wonderfully appropriate theme musical background."
4,To live and survive in foreign lands !,"An uneducated Italian man tries to find new landscapes of hopes and illusions seeking work in Switzerland,. But sometimes what you seek and what you find don't coincide.A cult movie in many art houses around the world and certainly one of the amusing but devastating films around this delicate and terrible drama about the inner immigrants."
2,bread and chocolate,i bought this for 2 reasons because NINO MANFREDI made a ITALIAN SONG that i liked very much and the other because my friend had seen it 35 years ago and he said he liked it .after watching it i found it so so maybe because i have trouble liking italian mvies even though i am ITALIAN.last to say if i was brought in ITALY i would have enjoyed the film better
2,"too much chocolate, not enough bread!","BREAD: funny at points, the main actor was a sensitive and sympathetic character...at first at least... also the portrayal of a a man out of his country, out of his element struck a symbolic chord in me (= a person not at home in him/herself, not on a connected path, a lost soul out of joint)CHOCOLATE: the character went too far at being comedic and became a buffoon, so that it was hard to empathize with him...and at that point the story lost its symbolic strength. also, by the plot going over the top, becoming too wild and absurd, it lost its simple power and just became dull, frankly.i couldn't finish watching it."
5,Hippie Rocks,"Nope! Not talking about crack! The newest thing in the progressive festival hippy are metal works wrapped by master crafts men around different stones. Progression is key and making a name for yourself before the season will garner more respect for you and your tent while selling your merch. Have this book around and you'll look just that much more legit, flip through it and even highlight your favorite parts for a conversation starter.See you on the grounds."
5,very knowledgable,i have always woundered how to use crystals and activate them. i was always stumped when the subject arose. plants were easy to communicate with but stones and metals? this book enlightened me in the conserns of the mineral realm and now i'm in a new world. thank you cunningham!
5,A fantastic book.,I read this book cover to cover and I learned virtually everything I could ever hope to know on the magic of stones and metals. It is an excelent beginner's guide or expert's reference. Very highly recommended (Along with anything by Scott Cunningham).
3,Limited in its usefulness,"I wish this book had better documented its sources. A lot of the material was very limited in its usefulness. I bought this and used it maybe three times. It is gathering dust.There is NOTHING patently WRONG with the book, it's just not very useful or engaging.Cunningham did much better work."
4,books,I bought this book as a gift and they really enjoyed this book and was so happy to get it that it was a surprise it was something they had really wanted.
3,Good for Basic Knowledge,"If you want to delve into the world of Gems, Crystals and Metal, this is ok, but not complete. I had one item in particular that I was looking for and it was not found in the book, I would have to say, look for a more complete book."
4,Good book for beginners,"I been into 'Rock' magic my whole life because of my mom. This was my first book I have ever read and it really got me into it. It's a very good book, for a beginner, learning how everything works, but for more experienced people you might want to look at something different because this is a nice book but is really like a 'gemstone magic for dummys'. I still refer back to it when I need a quick look into a stone I don't know much about. I have and will always refer this to friends and family!"
3,"One for the library, but not the only one","Cunningham is widely respected by most pagan types, and deservedly so. Most of his reference books are thorough and authoritative. His gemstone book, however has some drawbacks. The photos in the book are poor: They aren't very representative of the specimens a collector or practitioner is likely to encounter. Also, there is a limit to the thoroughness of his entries on each mineral. This book is a decent introduction to crystals and gemstones. However, for those serious about the practice of magick involving gems, THIS SHOULD NOT BE THE ONLY BOOK IN YOUR COLLECTION."
4,Easy enjoyable read,"My first exposure to Scott Cunningham. Found the book very easy and enjoyable to read. I was able to read it in one sitting. He provides a great deal of information and presents it in a clear and easy to understand way. This book would make an excellent reference tool and I recommend it for anyone seeking such a resource. The only downer was (to me) the excess of ""money making"" spells, delivering a message the average wiccan is a very financially challanged or money centric individual. I would like to imagine there are more graceful things we can apply energy to than making money."
3,Basic magical corrispondance,"This is a good magical corrispondance book on stones, metals, and gems. its a good referrance book when you need some information on the magickal properties of a stone or it's use but I have found that there are many stones not mentioned in the book. perhapse with the increase in types of stones available in the market today this book might be getting a little dated. Still a good resouce to have on hand if you can't find a better on or if you don't do a lot of stone magick work.... but it might be worth looking into a more comprehensive one, that includes a greater variety if you are doing a lot of work with stones."
1,could be alot better,"Another scott cunningham typical book. The author attempts to create a book about crystal and metal practice but it is a very fluffy bunny wiccan format, usual for him. The author explains overbaringly so about ethics and morality and gives rules on how one is ""allowed"" to use stones. The author also claims that in certain configurations like a necklace stones are more powerfull than seperate peices. He further explains that polished stoned are more powerfull than stones in the rough, IS HE SERIOUS? I would tend to believe that using a stone in its natural state is far better than a man tumbled and polished stone. Anyways if your looking for a good book on stones read LOVE IS IN THE EARTH by MELODY. Its a far better work. Also if I might add, its a good idea to just stay clear of scott cunningham books all together."
1,Oh my,This is not a book you want in your collection. The author seems to present his material in a one sided one track manner that sort of feels like fingernails across a chalkboard when reading it. I read the other reviews and can agree with whoever wrote in saying that Cunningham actualy does claim that polished stones are more powerfull than those in their natural state. If thats not enough information for you not to buy this book then I dont know what is.
1,HUH,The author gives a wiccan explaination of the use of stones and claims that stones which are polished are more powerfull than those in the rough. DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY
1,missing pages,"I would love to give a great review for this book . However , when I recieved this ,the book was missing 1/3 of its pages , and they had no more to exchange it with ."
4,One of the best references available on this subject,"This book is detailed but not exhaustive. Cunningham has a way of cutting through the veils of arcane muddle and get right to the subject at hand. This is the reference that we recommend for those that wish to enter the world of gemstone, crystal and metal magic and a must for anyone that needs a reference on this subject. The description of each mineral or metals mystical properties are clearly described in enough detail to let you know what is is best suited for. The chapters preceding the descriptions are written in a simple and straight forward manner that does not favor any one religion or belief system. He lets the reader take what they need from it and apply it accordingly. Mr. Cunningham also includes a quick reference summary that is set up in a logical and easy to use format. His direct way of sharing this important information is refreshing and of great value to the spiritual/new age community."
2,Yikes!,"Was I ever disappointed by this! When I saw the word ""encyclopedia"" I assumed that's what it was, and that it was going to be a good one. But the information within is terribly scarce. The author seems to have picked only his favorites to include, when really all stones and metals should (In my opinion, even if they're not expensive or popular) be covered at least in passing, and left out a variety of information about the materials themselves and instead talked about just the more common magical uses and folklore. Anyone looking for information on stones, crystals, and the like can get better than this."
5,Gemstone maven,"One of the first books I bought dealing with precious ""rocks"" and magick. Full of information."
1,Lost along the way,"I consider this book to be one of my greatest waste of time and money to date. By the title one would think/hope it dealt with advanced Navigating skills. After reading it, I can assure you it dose NOT! What it is, is a rambling self praise book that deals with survival skills. Yes those skills do include navigation, but Mr Davenport's long winded overly complicated discriptions make it laboreous to learn even the most basic skill. I learned more about navigating and survival watching the movie ""The Edge"". My advice to anyone thinking about buying this book is to save your money and buy one of the military manuels instead."
5,All-terrain safety,"Most books on the outdoors include details on how to read a map and a compass; but here global survival expert Greg Davenport (who is considered one of the best in the world) offers both basics and advanced techniques, covering not just maps and compasses but charts, finding cardinal directions, using the stars to navigate, and much more. Chapters tell how to hike under all kinds of conditions, how to maintain safety under snow, rain, or rock climbing conditions, and how to pair navigation skills with basic wilderness survival savvy."
3,Advanced Outdoor Navigation,"Although the title is ""Advanced Outdoor Navigation"" the author spends considerable time on other topics. If you are an outdoors-person you will no doubt have a wide variety of books on the subject. I was looking for one specifically on navigation, NOT all the other items. The author uses 132 pages of the 293 book going over survival (not navigation related) and mountaineering.Another area were I had to grade the book poorly on was the lack of color in the text. Many mapping symbols are color related. For them to be in black and white takes away from understanding the map symbols."
3,okay!,"this one is a little ruff, but sometimes i like it ruff, and its mostly there first stuff they ever did soooooooo!"
4,A well-written discussion of Greek-African contact,"Snowden seems to really know what he's talking about. To someone as ignorant in the subject as I was, it was a great read to learn all about the contact between the ancient Africans and Greeks. The pictures and explanations of artifacts are especially interesting."
3,Spain Revisited,"I bought this DVD after reading Alvah Bessie's ""Spain Again"", a biographical account of Bessie's return to the battlegrounds of the Spanish Civil War and the making of this film. Bessie himself appears in a small but significant role in the film. Blacklisted as one of the Hollywood Ten, Hollywood deprived itself of the services of one of it's great scriptwriters, certainly one of its humane. Worth watching."
3,Biddy biddy bang bang,Must have considering not much out there for Mouse full concert footage. Video not that great but sound is dialed in. A must have fir Mouse fans! Also comes with music cd for your car etc
2,"Poor sound/video quality, decent show....","I'm not a fan of this particular dvd, which is a shame...it's the only true Eek video I can find anywhere. The quality is very similar to the Barrington Levy (Wanted) Live in SF dvd....poor at best. The lighting is terrible, and the audio is not representative of what Eek brings to a live show. Only a true hardcore Eek fan will find this one tolerable."
5,Multi-V Review,Product works well and has a complete list of ingredients to achieve its purpose. Would be nice if you didn't have to take three times a day. Guess that's a small price to pay for the results.
5,Yeah. it's good,I do feel I have more energy to really get through the workout and I don't pee out all of the ingredients of the vitamins but they are a bit pricey. I advocate First Endurance products.
5,Very helpful!!,"This book has helped me write MANY songs. I'm not very knowledgeable when it comes to music theory. So this book was able to teach me many new chords. Also, it has helped with transposing to a different key. It tells you which chords are in certain keys. I love this book and definitely recommend it for someone like me who doesn't know all that much about music theory but enjoys writing music."
2,"Decent start, interesting premise, lousy finish","This was a disappointing book. It started ok, and actually was a fairly good (maybe B-) read for most of the book, but just a terrible finish (like D-).The protaganist was just too wimpy. And the book finishes that way.This was a thriller that was also a human drama (or was it a human drama that was also a thriller?). But the thrill died out, and the drama didn't flourish.I'd give it one star, but it was decent most of the way through, so let's go with 2**."
1,Ho Hum,"Sorry, but this one bored me to tears. The million-dollar jackpot is a nice thought, but even that's cliche like most everything else in the book."
3,"Great Premise, super start, so-so finish","This book starts out with a great premise. Finding millions of dollars in an abandoned cellar, what would you do with it? That becomes Ben Lindberg's problem in the beginning of Windfall. And it's an interesting problem. The bad guys are looking for their money, he can really use, but how can he spend it without getting caught. The first half of this book is great, really enjoyed it. From then on, it deteriorates into basically a car chase, fight with the bad guys and not the happiest of endings. Could have been much better (see A Simple Plan), but not the worst book I've read either."
4,A Simple Plan Redoux,"Maybe I enjoyed ""Windfall"" so much because I also loved ""A Simple Plan"", and the basic plots are quite similar. Magnuson does a great job of having his main character, Ben, agonize over the questions we'd all ask when trying to hide illicit funds. How does an honest man launder money? When will the bad guys show up? How do I find a way to make this money improve, and not ruin my life?The tension is high, and I finally gave up trying to read it in bed and finished the novel during the day. I just couldn't get to sleep after a session with this story! It's not Shakespeare, but it surely was an entertaining and thought-provoking rollercoaster of a novel."
4,A page turner! Couldn't put it down!,"This is an extremely entertaining novel about the ""lure"" of materialism."" It grabs you and doesn't let go. It was taut and suspenseful - highly recommend!"
2,Fasr but damaged book,Book came in fast but had damage to the page edges and looks like mold on some pages. Not impressed
3,I've only cracked this book once or twice.,I use my Egan's a lot more than this. It doesn't really help me a lot. The diagrams are not labeled clearly and it's hard to use this as a reference when looking at the real equipment in lab.
3,Really difficult to read,"I think this book would be great for Registered or Certified therapists, but as a student, myself and my classmates found this to be difficult reading. We think at the student level, the techniques to therapies and how it affects the patient is more important than the mechanical parts of the machines we use. I liked the Pilbeam mechanical Ventilation book much, much more."
5,Mosby`s Respiratory Care Equipment.,This book is awesome! I would advice it to every student. I think this book would be also helpful to any practitioner that deals with respiratory equipment.
4,La grande lessive,"In this movie,Bourvil and Francis Blanche take you on a fantasy trip,that only the two ot them have the secret. Bourvil was a very talented french actor, acting with a mix of humor and poetries and extemely credible in his performances,it worth mentioning because too many peoples stop at his humorous style only."
2,BEWARE!! THIS IS **PAN & SCAN**,"According to a scan of the DVD's back, this film is NOT letterboxed, but Pan & Scan. SHame on MGM, what they did to ""Hawaii"" earlier this year, they are doing to this title."
2,Never an origional thought in there lives,"This is typical of the time in which it was produced. Screen writers then (and now) have most probably never written anything original and as such must depend on the hard work of others. In this case, Mark Twain. Don't waste time and money on this rewriting of a classic."
4,Buy it.,"My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed this DVD. It is cute, entertaining and apppropriate for the whole family. It is a fun introduction to Mark Twain.Most of all, we are very familiar with the small town of Arrow Rock where it was filmed and that world still exists in places."
5,gma barb,"My husbands grandfather had a small part in a 4th of july parade scene. This was a present for fathers day for him. He was over joyed great movie ,price and ship time thanks"
1,DO NOT BUY THIS RIDICULOUS COPY,If You will buy this DVD you only see half of the film.IT IS PAN & SCAN not the original format.I do not understand how the Author's Artistic Rights permits an assassination like this.Joo Pereira Bastos
4,"Returning to Arrow Rock, MO","This summer we revised Arrow Rock, Missouri where this film was made.Johnny Whitaker and Celest Holme were there also. Seeing the area and the ""stars"" prompted me to order the film. There were so many places thatwere recognized in the film that are still in existence in Arrow Rock today."
4,A Jonny Whitaker Fan,I have been waiting for this movie to come out on dvd. I think the movie is a good one. Jonny Whitaker was great as Tom Sawyer and Jeff East was good as Huck Fun. All the actors were great. I own the tape and the dvd. I would recommend this movie to every one who likes tom sawyer and musicals.
1,Waste of a release!,I remember seeing this movie when I was a kid at Radio City Music Hall in New York. I really loved it and as DVD's became more and more popular over the years I waited anxiously for the release of Tom Sawyer. All I can say is this.................IF A MOVIE IS FILMED IN WIDESCREEN FORMAT THEN PLEASE RELEASE IT IN WIDESCREEN ON DVD. Don't waste your money on this until the studios wise up.
5,A family must in a world full of garbage movies for kids,I saw this movie as a child and even have the music to it that I still play on the piano. I do feel like offering children movies like this instead of the garbage that is out there today with Harry Potter witchcraft and violence of every kind is a far better alternative to raising healthy-minded children
3,"Pretty good, and Johnny Whittaker rocks in the part","Well, there are some irritating changes (I agree with the Aunt Polly assertion), but Johnny Whittaker is the best Tom Sawyer that's had the part; he looks and sounds and acts exactly like I pictured Tom when I read the book, and that's a huge plus. The songs are nothing special, but they're catchy enough."
5,AN AMERICAN CLASSIC TREASURE MOVIE,READER'S DIGEST'S TOM SAWYER IS REALLY AN AMERICAN CLASSIC TREASURE. IT SHOULD BE RELEASED ON DVD FULLY REMASTERED WITH SOUVENIR PICTURE BOOKLET. I REMEMBER WHEN I SAW IT ON THAT 70MM SCREEN WITH FULL STEREO SOUND IN RADIO CITY MUSIC HALL WHEN IT FIRST WAS RELEASED. I RATED THIS MOVIE FULL 5 STARS. THEY SHOULD ALSO RELEASE THE SOUNDTRACK ON CD.
1,Tom Sawyer,Definitely not as described. No refund. No contact from the seller. DO NOT trust this item's description!
1,One star rating not a reflection of quality of movie,"The movie is probably a really good movie, I last saw it when I was a child. I only gave it one star because that is where it says ""I hate it"" and I do. This movie scared the crap out of me when I was a kid. Not one I'm in a hurry to rewatch, even nearly 40 years later."
2,whatever,this movie is like so the not so awesome.we are watching it in school(me go to mater dei academy)and when i go home my ears hurt so much from all the... singing.i wish it only had like no singing and like what is up with the charectors dos man it is like way out there if ya know what i'm sayin.so i would not like refer this to anyone.if yall wanna watch tom sawyer watch the one with jtt.
1,NOT PAN AND SCAN !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Once again, the idiots in charge of DVD at MGM/UA give us a pan and scan version of this wonderful, FILMED IN PANAVISION film. Why is it the laserdisc version was not only letterbox, but had the Overture as well ????? What happened with the DVD ????? STAY AWAY FROM THIS ONE, unless you can track down an old Laserdisc copy. WAKE UP MGM/UA !!!!!!!!"
3,Quality construction but innacurate temp and humidity guages,"It's nice and heavy, sealed form the elements and looks great. My gripes concern the temperature and humidity gauges. I'm a technically minded person and have calibrated them over and over using a mercury thermometer and humidity data from the airport a couple of miles away. Temp is off by a three or four degrees every other day or so. Humidity gauge is so far out of whack that I can't use it for anything."
5,Harry at his best,"Almost every song has that Harry magic. Not to take anything away from his other albums, I like this one the best. There's an energy in his stories that is new, fresh and profound. Your passions will certainly be gently agitated with these delightful and well constructed illustrations."
2,Nada que valga la pena,Me llego el producto cuarenta y algo de días después de ser ordenado y la verdad es que por una impresión como esta nunca debí invertir ese dinero.
2,Not right game.,It was not forxbox 360 It would not play. Grandson upset because he couldn't. Play game.I will Deirdre this game.
1,Wrong Game Sent to Me !!!,"I Ordered NCAA 07 XBox 360, Not Plain Old Xbox!? This Game is Incompatible With XBox 360 !!? I Want My Money Back !!!"
2,Too arcade style,"When i bought this game i was used to playing live 09 and 10 on the 360. I like how realistic these games are. this game is nothing like that. It's more like a ""street"" game so arcade style. Not really worth my time."
4,WOW didn't know it would be this average,"this game needs to either good or bad. Every time you think this game has something good in it, something bad overshadows it. Overall a really average game"
2,camp oven cover,"The cover is well made and as such a very good product. Putting it on the camp oven is not easy due to the fact that it fully encloses the oven, top and bottom. It is for me to much trouble putting it on the camp oven. I would have preferred a cover which fits over the oven like a hood with an open bottom. This would cover the oven and keep it out of the weather and that is all I do need. I do not want to wrestle the oven while putting it into a complete enclosed storage bag it is getting to cumbersome for a 75 year old guy."
1,Incomplete drum set,This item arrived incomplete. I received a box labeled 2 of 2. Inside was the shells of 2 drum pieces. All the stands were missing. I called Amazon back and they said this item is under review. I was offered a similar set for equal price. The staff at Amazon were great in finding me a solution so that my son could get his drum kit by his birthday. I can't review on the actual product as it was incomplete.
1,Don't buy this,We ordered this for my son's birthday. Two boxes arrived separately from different shipping companies. There were hundreds of pieces including the nuts and bolts and there were no instructions.
1,CAUTION,"After ordering I saw the review which explained that what you see and what is stated is in fact misleading. I was hoping to be able to surprise my son and daughter with the complete drum set show in the pictures. However as mentioned in another review only one box arrived. There was no stand for the throne, no stands for the symbols, no snare, no pedal for the bass drum, no feet for the floor tom, no stand for the snare, and no instructions on how to assemble any of it. I have emailed Music123. Here it is Christmas Eve and I have no hope of salvaging this. I will revise if some favorable response is received. [...]"
1,POOR QUALITY DRUMS,T HIS DRUM SET IS NOT BUILT WELL POOR CRAFTMANSHIP AND BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE AT D DRUM {MIKE P }.
3,"An ""OK"" kitty book","""I Love Kittens"" is a board book for toddlers mostly. It has cute illustrations of a little girl and her kitten. However, it drives me nuts when I read the book because it really doesn't make much sense. It starts off by saying ""I love my kitten because...."" and it gives one reason. Then it goes into what else the cat does. It is lacking focus.My daughter likes it okay. It's not horrible, just a bit annoying if you're a writer."
5,very pretty ring,This was a very pretty ring with a nice amethyst. The celtic design matches my wedding ring very well.
3,Updated,"When I ordered this ring I knew I would love it. The color is beautiful and matches my purple nail polish. I also bought a pendant to match and they look great together. I looked at some of the other rings and am seriously considering getting another one.EDIT: I really don't know how long I've had this ring, but I'd estimate that it's been a year and 8 months. Early on the band bent and it has turned black in several places. I thought I'd give everyone a heads up. I was looking for a replacement and it irritated me that no one thought to go back and write about how the ring was doing a year or even a few months after the purchase."
2,very cute but.....,"I dont know about you, but I have NEVER had a Sterling Silver ring turn my finger green. so I am not even sure if they are really sterling silver. I will not be buying any of these rings again."
5,"awesome horn solos, delightfully jazzy ska","Another stellar effort from the original kings of ska--the skatalites just keep getting better with age! Of all the Skatalites albums I've listened to(Foundation Ska, Ball of Fire, Stretching Out, and this one), this one is by far my favorite, for three reasons: 1) great horn solos, maybe the best I've heard on any of their albums, and a good balance between sax, trumpet, and trombone solos. 2) The songs on this album are never too repetitive--some songs on their other albums have a tendency to repeat the same chord over and over again ad nauseum, but you won't find that here. 3) The overall ensemble sound on this record is superb. Similar to Ball of Fire, but with better(less repetitive) songs and more and better solos."
4,Memorable,"Memorable... is the best I can say. It is nice to hear the resounding voice of Johnny Maestro again. The track, ""The Worst That Could Happen"" is his best since ""Sixteen Candles"", recorded with the Crests too many years ago !"
1,comment,"I really want this CD; however,I have had no luck with it. I can play 10 CDs, with no problem...put this one on and it sticks. Cleaning the CD and the player doesn't help. Guess I am out of luck."
5,Perfect for outside speaker wire,"Very happy with this purchase. Recently ran new speakers out to my backyard. Wasn't 100% that this would work for speakers, but decided to take a chance, as it was 1/3 the price of products that were labeled outdoor speaker wire - direct burial. Functions as speaker wire flawlessly, and is rated to be direct burial wire. Very happy with purchase, would recommend."
4,Its a cable,"Its a cable. It works great. For my LED setup, the 14 ga was just fine and a good savings over 12ga. In the end though, it would have been a few cents cheaper just to go buy it at a big box store."
5,Love this wire!,"Not only do I use it in my yard for low voltage lights, I use it for my car stereo projects (speaker wire). It's pretty heavy stuff and 100% copper. As far as I can tell over the years, this stuff doesn't oxidize hardly at all..."
2,Characters with an inner life would help,"I picked up this book because the review on the cover called it the female counterpart to Umberto Eco's The Name of the Rose. So much for book covers. A better comparison would be to Eco's Foucault's Pendulum, since both involve vast conspiracy theories and arcane magic. Eco's book works because it's really about people, and about the human fallibilities that make us want to believe such unlikely tales; Neville's characters, on the other hand, are too lifeless to support the implausible plot. Much heavy-handed foreshadowing and historical namedropping. Read Eco instead."
5,Wake up and smell the coffee!,"This is an excellent book! It deals with so many subjects and how they intertwine with one another. This is the type of book that can inspire a person to go back to school and learn something new.""The Eight"" deals with how everything, from mathematics and music, intertwines with political and government leaders throughout history. We are just a small stitch in the patchwork of time. Get involved and make your voice heard!"
2,Starts strong then peters out...,"I had high hopes for this book when I started reading it for my book club. It became silly and improbable very quickly, and then moved along to being predictable. This is not the ""female Umberto Eco"" that one reviewer claimed I'd be reading. Leave this one on the shelf."
2,Very Disappointing,"Great plot device but outcome is very predictable. The characters are so stock as to be out of comic books. The author does a better job with the 18th century than with the 20th, the historical characters come alive and are fun and interesting while the fictional characters (the stars of the book) are terrible. How about some realism in your people Ms. Neville -- give them them age appropriate positions in the world and be at least somewhat realistic in their experiences. Very disappointing and ultimately brought down the book to a less than enjoyable read."
2,BIG Dissapointment,"This realy let me down....given the unique plot line SO much more could have been done with it. Aside from the two main female protagoniss the rest of the line-up is either far too predicable or outright lame to the point of pain.If I had to stomach the ""wise-gal"" Lily for one more page I would have recycled the book.If I had to red one more instance of her powder puff dog attacking the bad guys with leg bites to save the day I would have burned it. And if I had to read about one more orgasm reached in 3 seconds I would have........At least I won't waste time or Euros on any sequels."
5,"part of my ""stranded on a desert island"" kit","My absolutely favorite fiction work ever -- I reread it (at least) annually. Compelling, absorbing, amazing.If you need to, read the rest of the reviews here. Otherwise, hurry up and get it -- in fact, get multiple copies -- you'll pass this to friends and your copy will inevitably wander away."
1,Ridiculous!,"Ms. Neville appears to think that a plot that barrels along at top speed, throws in a couple dozen historical figures, changes locations, time periods and players with regularity makes for fine fiction! The primary characters are caricatures of the intrepid heroine, the mysterious hero(es), and the amusing side-kick. Don't waste your time with this one."
5,A can't stop Reader of a Book.,"This book was given to me as a gift from a very special chess friend. I love to read but read slow sometimes (just taking my time), but not this book I read it in one weekend (the only one since then). I reread this book every year because it is just amazing how the author gets you involved and keeps the story moving at different paces through out the book. I wish I could find more books like this one. Too bad that a 10 is the highest I can rate this book, because a 10 is really too low of a rating. It makes you want to visit the autor face to face just to shake her hand and express your thanks for such wonderful reading enjoyment. Well got to go the book is calling me again..."
2,almost a one star,"I can't give this book an one star like I'd like to only because I finished it. You see, if it was truly awful I would not have got to the end at all. The only saving grace for me was the descriptions of the exotic lands this book took me to, Algeria and the Sahara Desert especially. The descriptions were much better than the story. Heck, the more I think of it, if I wanted descriptions of settings, I could have read a tour guide and have been entertained. I have changed my mind, I will rate it one star after all."
2,Tedious,"It's supposedly as awesome as the Da Vinci Code but to tell you the truth, it's tedious. If you want evidence read only page 186. She goes into SO much detail about the bookstore (useless information) that you have to wonder if the bookstore is some sort of inanimate character that will somehow fit into the plot later (magically come to life etc etc). Is it really necessary to add that much detail about the store? I mean, really. It's ok but I don't think the chess aspect of it is as exciting as the reviewers supposedly think it is. Also, it talks about the ""Service"" and its history, why it's so great, etc. but I did not really get the feeling that it was that powerful...which is important bc it's the central object of this novel, lol."
1,Had to force myself to finish it.,"What a waste of money. The back cover summary sounded good, but the book was full of excessive details, dates, names, and amazing coincidents that it not only bored me to death, it was totally unbelievable. A complete waste of time."
2,What?,"I tried to read this book...I really did. I got 2/3 of the way through and finally had enough. Yes...I know this is fiction, but is it also supposed to be fantasy? So....two women drive through the HOTTEST desert on earth in a rolls royce with NO ROOF. They have no food, and barely enough water, not to mention a little dog and are rescued by a plane that happens to be big enough to transport them AND the rolls royce. ARE.YOU.KIDDING.ME? That along with the back and forth from past to future about a chess set and different people being the players is just too much. What is the point? NOTHING makes sense and sadly I was not willing to find out. The book could have been cut in size if there was an actual STORY. This is just fluff with each chapter more ridiculous than the last."
1,WORST BOOK EVER!,"I HAVE NO IDEA HOW THIS BOOK IS SO HIGHLY RATED. IT IS BADLY WRITTEN & BADLY RESEARCHED. THE CHARACTERS ARE PREDICTABLE, THE STORY ARC BORING. The Catholic church are the good guys, the Knights Templar the bad guys ... don't waste your money."
1,"Come back Dan Brown, all is forgiven!","I'm not a particular fan of Dan Brown's but at least The Da Vinci Code has pace and an intriguing plotline in its favour.The Eight, on the other hand, is a bit of an embarassment. Nevermind the cardboard characters and the clunking prose, but I am now on page 322 and hardly anything has happened!Oh yes, there are plenty of winks and nudges, dark hints and smouldering looks - but when will this plot actually get into second gear?? I hate giving up on books, but tonight I have made a decision not to waste any more of my life on this truly dreadful effort.Personally, I can't understand how any publisher would have taken this on and then not at least employed an experienced editor to make it halfway readable.I'm not normally this grumpy (honest!) but The Eight is just way below anything that you would expect to pay money for. If I could, I would have give it zero stars..."
5,An outstanding blend of history and the present,"I had never heard of Katherine Neville, until a friend recommended that I read this book. I bought it and took just a weekend to read it entirely. The blend of 18th century history with the mid seventies was superb. It was hard to put the book down. If you like Chess, History, Mystery and a smattering of Archaeology, you will enjoy this one. The pace is fast and it it doesnt get bogged down anywhere. This is easily the most enjoyment I have had in a book in a long time."
5,Better than DaVinci Code...,"...and I loved The DaVinci Code. The Eight is not well-known enough in my opinion. I passed it along to my mom who is a die-hard book lover and she loved it so much that she's passed my copy on to one of her friends.With that having been said, The Eight is one of those books that goes back and forth between present day and the past. It also provides descriptive words to help you visualize places you may not have visited, such as Africa.It's been a while since I read it, and writing this review makes me want to reread it because it was very complex and detailed, and a reread will likely help me get a better understanding of some points I may have originally missed. And I am not one to reread books! If you like mysterious, occult-like stories, with conspiracy thrown in, this is one to read!"
2,A good book to pass up.,"An interesting premise turned into a silly plot: New Age Woman goes on fantasy adventure. But my main trouble with the book was the writing style, or rather styles. It reads like it is written by two or three seperate entities (Neville into chanelling?). Particularly annoying was the voice of the modern day character, Cat Vellis, who sounded as if she would be more at home in a harlequin romance."
2,drivel,"I found the idea of the book interesting and I wanted to see how it turned out but I found it hard to get through the badly written, over-wrought pages. Too many flat characters, too much going on and too many ""if she had just known that her life was to change"" lead ons. This was a neat idea that needed a good editor--and maybe a better author."
2,Predictable; Not even close to Brown's Da Vinci Code as some may suggest,"This book was okay. Good Story telling between two era's that are brought together in the end, but it was predictable. I also felt there was too much filler content that made it unnecessarily lengthy. I picked this one up because some suggested to was similar to Brown's Da Vinci Code....but that was not the case."
3,Too much and not enough,"What a book! Everything is in here but nothing in depth. There's chess, but no moves. There's Napoleon, Robespierre and Rousseau, but none of them do much of anything. Algiers! OPEC! Freemasons! Secret formulas! Mysterious fortune tellers! Signs of the Zodiac! and more, much much more. Unfortunately it's too much to hold together with any real coherence or believabilty.That said, I must admit that I was interesed in the story of the young nun, until she started cavorting all over Europe and the Mid-East. Excuse me, but I don't think it was that easy for people to sprint around the continent like that in times of strife and limited opportunities, especially young women.If you like chess thrillers and you want to actually have some chess moves in your chess thriller, read ""The Flanders Panel"" by Perez-Reverte."
2,PERILS OF PAULINE IN SPADES,"I give her one star for idea/plot and another for research. She gets none for writing only what is necessary to tell the story. She gets none for characters. She gets none for editing. The drivel went on ad infinitum. So many harsh, angry women and so many handsome, beautiful men ready to rescue said harsh, angry women. So many coincidental meet-ups of famous people. Like name dropping. She needs a new editor for sure."
2,Page-turner... Turn quickly!,"p. 68 -- ""There was one friend in particular whom I'd tried to reach, though he was as mysterious and inaccessible as the Sphinx. Little did I know how desperately I would need his help after the events that would soon take place.""p.130 -- ""Little did I know that thirty blocks away, a move was about to take place that would soon alter the course of my life...""~ p. 200 -- little did I know how soon I would so little care who ended up with the darn chess set! So I missed finding out where an aging Leibnitz taught the young Handel the secret handshake. Oh, well."
1,How did this get 4 1/2 stars?,"My ""Amazon.com Strategy"" is to buy books with an Average Customer Review of 4 1/2 or 5 stars. It has worked well (I've bought and enjoyed The Firm, Jurassic Park, And Then There Were None, The Other Side of Midnight, etc.). However my Amazon.com Strategy failed me on The Eight. It was boring to me. I had to work hard to get through all 598 pages."
5,Gets better with every re-read,"I first read this book over ten years ago, and enjoyed it. Since that time, I have earned both a B.A. and M.A. With the additional educational background, the re-read of the book was fabulous! Neville knows her stuff -- and manages to weave together an interdisciplinary approach of highly sophisticated ideas while still telling a good story. I am looking forward to re-reading The Magic Circle with new perspectives.A highly provocative book."
4,Stellar!,"Great read. Kept me spellbound. In my opionion the best of Katherine Neville's books. The change of time period was really well timed. All in all an outstanding read for the history nut, the chess buff, and a little bit for the romance enthusiast too."
3,"Interesting ideas, leaden writing","A rush of historical figures and locales, several attractive/sexy characters, and a convoluted tie-in to chess and mathematics can't lift this novel beyond mediocrity. The problem is the leaden amateurish writing. Instead of carrying you along, the plot line's gyrations and the bland writing push you into exhaustion."
4,Wow... A book from the 80's,"Having graduated from high school in 1987, I didn't read unless it was Swimmer's World Magazine, or my high school newspaper to find my name. This was a great story, history (although not entirely accurate) current events (of the 70's) and a timeline that becomes so intertwined you don't remember which way is up, and I think that's a good thing. Thanks to Amazon.com's recommendation service for this one. Pick it up at a half price store, it's worth it."
1,Awful.,"I really tried to like this book and I thought the concept was interesting...but the terrible dialogue, complete lack of suspence and flat characters made me stop reading about half way through. From the beginning there was never any compelling evidence as to why Catherine (the main character for the modern portion of the book) was in danger, yet she is shot at and has her apartment broken into, all for simply having heard about the chess set. I would recommend any of the other popular historical/intrigue novels (Angels & Demons, DaVinci Code, The Rule of Four, Name of the Rose) over this one."
2,"Great idea, but the execution is too confused","I picked up this book after reading and loving ""The DaVinci Code."" The premise of two women in different time periods on a quest for the pieces of a mystical, Moorish chesss set of untold power is a great idea, but this book is just too unwieldy in its execution. There were too many characters to keep track of, and only a few of those were developed to their full potential. The book seemed too scattershot -- it contained references to everyone from Napoleon to Catherine the Great to Benedict Arnold, Wordsworth, Mohammar Qaddafi, and Bach. You don't even really find out what the chess set does until after the first 300 pages or so. I finished it only because I had invested so much time in it. I will say that by the end, there's a good pay off that ties everything together, but after 600 pages, it's just too little too late."
5,Masterful! The Eight is a 10!,"Katherine Neville's use of almost every historical person and event of the late 1700's adds a sense of reality to this almost-epic novel of power, politics, romance, mystery, and quest for ultimate knowledge. Her knowledge of history adds realism and believe-ability to her fiction. She excels at weaving 2 seemingly unrelated stories with cliff-hanger chapter endings which compel the reader to continue reading until the end. A wonderful read; this is one book you WILL read again."
3,Disappointed,"I'm not going into what the book's about, since it's already been discused in previous reviews.The plot is interesting and the jumping back and forth story from the different ages I enjoyed. I could't wait to find out the end of the ""Game."" Suffice to say, that I agree there were many repetitions in the story. How absolutely disappointing! I could've overlooked a lot of the book, but to finish the book and feel that let down- what a wastew of time.I don't recommend the book. If you must, borrow it from somebody or purchase it used."
3,"Entertaining, with a few reservations","While I enjoyed The Eight, it took me a while to get through it. It was a keenly original plot, particularly considering it was written years before The DaVinci code. I thought there were too many characters, which made it drag at times. Also, the many historical figures got old after a while. And I have to agree that the ending was anticlimactic."
2,I regret wasting so much time reading this huge book,"I wanted to like this book. As I began, I felt the book could have used some editing, too many repeated phrases, too many unnecessary details (why did she put the dog in the sink?) After about 300 pages the lack of editing and the unbelievable coincidences became annoying, but I continued to read it, thinking there would be a payoff at the end. There was not. I never did figure out what ""The Eight"" was, and the breathless sex scenes and characters forever burying their faces in each others hair, shoulders, neck, etc. was intolerable. The plot had promise, but the execution was very flawed. A good editor could have cut this book in half and made it better."
2,Wanted to Like It More Than I Did,"I could not enjoy this book. I wanted to, I forced myself to read more than 450 pages to see if I could, but in the end I just didn't care enough to finish it. I found some plot elements too coincidental, our 1970s herione just a little too unlikeable, and for the life of me could not understand some charater's leaps of logic. That last could have something to do with me not understanding a thing about chess, though. I'm also someone who likes to be able to relate to, or at least feel some empathy for, a character I'm reading about, but none of the characters in this book caught me in any real way. Unfortunately this is not a book that I can recommend."
1,Bloated drivel,"This book is badly written, needlessly convoluted, and chock full of gratuitous and often inaccurate historical details. I found some of the historical name dropping laughable and clearly the author was overeager to impart intellectual gravitas to her sub-par effort by padding the narrative with copious amounts of historical celebrity name dropping. I'm not even going to mention all the bodice ripper rip-off sections that just make this book that much more of a chore to read. The whole book seems to be one big exposition consisting of around 590 pages leading to a rushed, limp ending that holds no thrill and is easily guessed, with a bit of imagination, much earlier."
2,Trying too hard,"It seems that the author was too committed to trying to tie chess and the number eight to everything in life regardless of how ridiculous the plot needed to be to make it happen.Characters were pretty simple, and the ""logic"" explaining thier actions just didn't make sense much of the time. I certainly wouldn't want the book to be any longer, but I think many of the scenes needed to be drawn out and developed further."
2,I can't believe I wasted my time on this book!,"I had read reviews of this book and was looking forward to a good read. As I was getting close to the end last night I thought, ""Surely the author is waiting to the very last to make this book worthwhile."" I'm still wondering how and WHY I stuck with it.What a disappointment and a waste of time. I learned a few interesting things about Algeria, however."
2,Long on tease; short on payoff,"It took me EIGHT weeks to read this book. If I were not a chess enthusiast, I probably would have given up early, but I kept looking for a payoff involving some grand chess theme. That never happened. I didn't have any problem with Neville's writing style, as some reviewers did, but I found it impossible to keep up with the jumble of French and Arab names of characters and towns. In summary, I gave the book a low rating because it raised questions that were never satisfactorily answered."
5,The Eight,Fantastic enthralling novel. A thriller that keeps you constantly interested whilst never being an obvious plot to predict.
2,Often a tease without every reaching it's potential,"After several attempts I've managed to fight my way to the half way point of `The Eight. At times it's riveting and at others positively dull, I know there has to be more given the rave reviews, but when?This is the first novel (just finished the entire stable of Dan Brown thrillers) in sometime I've used effectively as a cure for insomnia, that can't be a good testimony!"
2,Too boring to finish,"For better or for worse, I'm the kind of person who has to finish a book or movie once I start it. While I usually take less than a week to read a book, it took a few months to plod through 300 pages of this 600 page book, as I had to force myself to read it. Eventually I made the rare decision to cut my losses and give up.As others have mentioned, there are simply too many characters, minimal character development and a glut of never-ending backstory. Neville definitely could have used a good Editor to sharpen the plot and the writing. There are glimpses of an interesting plot throughout the book, which is why I read as much as I did, but it gets bogged down in the details."
5,could not put it down,"i read this book 5 years ago, and i still find it memorable. i just bought a copy to re-read. this book is fascinating, with a riveting plot and great historical and vivid visual detail. i was completely enthralled while reading this, and when i was finished, i sorely missed it. i highly recommend it for long plane rides, traveling in europe; to fans of medieval history or visual, narrative writing (like barbara tuchman); and anyone who appreciates a good, ripping yarn, or serious-minded mystery novel!"
4,A Fasinating Read,Over the centuries a secret has been hidden away from anyone who would seek to abuse its power. One brave woman gives her life in an attempt to protect the course of the worlds history from changing course for ever.The secret revolves around a chess set given to Charlemagne by a group of Moors. During the revolution in France a group of nuns are forced to unearth the secret buried for a thousand years. The women scatter across the world taking the chess pieces with them.. Embedded in each piece is a code. Whoever can reassemble all of the pieces will have unlimited power.Centuries later a woman is chosen to join those who are protecting the chess pieces. Will the greatest riddle of all time give up its secret?I found this book an irresistible read and had difficulty putting it down to get my beauty sleep.
4,Grips the imagination,"I received this book as gift for Mother's Day. I finally read it and gobbled it up in 3 days!! It was that good. I personally enjoyed the toggling of past to present. Even more so the characters bumping into historical figures. Very creative. This is not for the faint of heart though. The writing is mature, eloquent and at times funny. For people who did not understand the book I think its more of a lack of imagination. But I do think that it does lack something...Like why Cat was the chosen one? Who the heck is she anyway??? Needless to say I enjoyed the book for what it is..entertainment. I also found Lily and Carioca my favorite characters! My only gripe is that the author chose to write the novel in 1973 which makes the novel seem obsolete in certain ways. Like no cell phones, email or even normal mail. I had to remind myself several times about this fact. But overall it is an enjoyable read."
3,"Haven't finished it yet, but...","Fairly interesting book. I'm a fan of both chess and history. I bought the book after hearing a sample of the audiobook on XM Radio.I agree with other reviewers who were critical of the ""historical name-dropping."" I've just gotten to the part where Mirelle meets Napoleon. Must it be Napoleon?There is some sloppiness, too. For example, Talleyrand's family, when challenged, would ""throw down the gauntlet rather than throw in the towel."" While boxing was present at the time, towels weren't used in the corners for more than one hundred years after the French Revolution.Overall, interesting so far, though far from perfect."
2,At least 200 pages too long,"This would have been an interesting book if it was only 400 pages long. The only truly charming character was killed off in the first 200 pages, and it's hard to care about any of the rest of them. The book had an interesting premise, and would have been interesting if it was significantly tightened up."
1,what a terrible excuse for a book,"someone recommended this book to me, knowing that i enjoyed eco's novels (esp. foucault's pendulum); needless to say, i have not taken anything seriously that that person has said to me since i finished reading this pitiful 'book'.don't be fooled by some idiot recommending this to you, it is a very very very very poor novel."
2,What am I missing?,"I'm halfway through and can't understand the rave review of the person who loaned the book to me. She loved it and I have a great deal of respect for her. But the book strikes me as being completely facile. Who would believe that this 20-something of the 20th century can be such a naive idiot, and the only female in a top accounting firm? And back to the 18th century, did Neville pick the top 10 names of the period and just casually drop them into the plot? The characters are silly and unbelievable in both time frames. What am I missing?"
2,Utter Pants,"If you enjoy reading the back of soup cans, then, boy, are you in for a thrilling time. If books are more your thing then avoid this contrived, bloated turkey of a novel in which the Author concocts a magical (not really) Chess service that secretly hides an alchemical formula. Forget hackneyed, graceless metaphors and try the real thing. It's called the Emerald Tablet."
2,Too bad,"I'd have to agree with one reviewer- if you are trying to fill the ""Da Vinci void"" this one won't do it. The danger in writing parallel stories is that the reader can easily lose track and one story may be more engaging than the other. Such was the case here. Also the unnecessary depth of detail detracted from the smooth flow of storyline. I didn't get past page 150 and decided to spend time more valuably. Call me still looking.................."
2,overzealous and disappointing,"I had high hopes for this book given the rave reviews, but was sadly disappointed by an author who tries so hard to mesh too many historical characters in such a cursory fashion. Add in the fantasy/mystical angle for the plot, and the book leaves you with the sense that absolutely nothing is authentic. The references to historical figures actually becomes tedious.In other ""semi-historical"" books the characters are fictional and the time period pseudo-accurate (e.g., the Alienist, Angels & Demons). Or the characters are as close to what one would imagine (e.g., The Great Train Robbery). In this case neither is true.Finally, I won't spoil the ending, but the resolution of the plot is horribly disappointing. The whole 600 pages talks about discovering a formula. Well?Overall, the writing style isn't bad, and the author has a way of keeping you reading. But, too many times I'd put the book down and say to myself, ""oh no, here comes another misused historical figure""."
5,"Excellent!! ""The Eight"" a novel","I'm not finished with this book because I hate to see it end. It has kept me glued all week. This is Friday and I started reading it Monday. I highly recommend for all those who love old world historical fiction, mystery, a thriller, adventure, chess, suspensful entertaining story! Can't believe this hasn't been made into a movie. Think it would be better than ""The DaVinci Code"". You've got to read this.... I give it a 10+ star rating..."
5,"A hard book to put down, it grabs you from the start!","This story is a fast page-turner, as you try to figure out what the ""next connection"" might be. The historical figures are woven in so well that the roles they play seem entirely plausible. Katherine Neville has a knack for writing thought- provoking suspense!"
5,"A great, addictive thriller","Katherine Neville sets up an amazing story that keeps you guessing, and staying up in the wee hours of the morning, through the whole book. I love chess, and this book immediately hooked me in. The characters are well developed and draw emotions from the reader. At points in the novel I thought I had the plot figured out, but then, BOOM, she throws a giant twist into the mix. I recommend this to anyone who loves any of the following things: chess, mystery, conspiracy, action, romance, or history. A great read!!"
2,"A long, hard slog","This ambitious book has a promising start, but it loses its way. Ms. Neville exhibits an impressive grasp of history, chess, mathematics, art, computers, and more--but that's a big part of the problem. The plot is full of gratuitous detours apparently designed simply to show off the author's knowlege of of these subjects. At first these bunny trails are minor distractions, but for me they built into a major annoyance. Only more patient and forgiving readers than I will make it to the end of this one."
2,Not memorable,"I say this because halfway through this tome I realized I'd read it a long time ago. The realization came as a shock. I didn't remember a thing about it. On rereading, I find it rather tiresome, dragging in every name Neville could think of and every reference to chess she could find (and Lewis Carroll she ain't). Divided by time, seeking the same chess board and pieces, the modern heroine is an idiot and completely unlikeable. The second heroine is better drawn, especially during the French Terror, but again...ultimately, who cares? I begin to dislike quests that end with the usual ""ultimate power in the wrong hands"" kind of thing. When a master takes it on, like Tolkien, then stand back. But when a much lesser light tries, it's a scatter shoot."
4,Good escapist read,"The book has two stories, one that takes place in Revolutionary France, and one that takes place in 1970s America and Algeria. Usually when a book has two plotlines like this I find myself favoring one over the other, but that was not the case in this one. I really enjoyed the story of Mireille and Valentine in the 1700s, and Catherine's narrative in the 1970s. There were so many historical figures play parts in the book--Napoleon, Catherine the Great, and Khaddafi (what a group!) There was a great amount of action in this book--intrigue, espionage, murder, and chess! One minute the story is in New York, the next they are stranded in the Sahara... it was fun to follow the ""players"" as they traveled around the world."
1,I'm so happy it ended...finally.,"I love to read. And I'll read about anything. I'm also a chess player and enjoy books that do multiple timelines with intertwining plots. I thought that ""The Eight"" would be really good.It wasn't.I was a history major in college. I know a good deal about the French Revolution. For Neville's portrayal of this era, I'd give her props. But the constant name dropping of historical characters was ridiculous. I found it distracting.I think my biggest gripe was the character Cat. I found it extrememly unrealistic for a person her age (26?) to be that skilled at computers in the time period she was in. And just because was she was 'smart'--she could decode everything?I felt like the plot could have been so much better---cleaner, direct...plausible.I read every book I start---but this one was hard to finish."
1,Dreadful Writing,"This book started with a potentially interesting idea, but the writing is so dreadful, the characters so cardboard, the plot so ridiculous, and the ending so unfufilling that I can only say if this is what passes for a good book these days, America is in serious trouble."
5,Excellent Read,"This is a great book. If you like historical fiction, you will like this book as well. It's easily as entertaining as Da Vinci Code, and less cliched."
3,Editing Needed,"I have heard people rave about this book, but I cannot join in their opinion. It started out with an interesting premise, but took a bit long to develop and then those 800 pages could have been cut back. I found the French story more interesting than the American one. It is not a book one can read at one sitting and can take time to get back into the story. I don't have any urge to read any more of Neville's books so I guess that tells the tale."
2,"Well researched and--well, boring","The subject of this book has always fascinated me. I've thoroughly enjoyed Tom Robbin's ""Still Life with Woodpecker, Eco's ""Foucaults Pendulum"", Neal Stephenson's ""Cryptonomicon"", Robert Anton Wilson's books, and even ""Gravity's Rainbow"" which all deal at various levels with hidden global conspiracies that are ""really"" behind history as we know it, and so it was with great anticipation that I picked up ""The Eight"". I loved the epic scale of the story, I loved all the historical references, puzzles, mind benders, chess quotes, etc. However, the prose all seems to have one pace, lacks real tension and release, and plods along dutifully to resolution. This book should have excited me but I found myself picking up one of several books I was reading at the time instead of racing to complete ""The Eight""."
3,Different story at the beginning than at the end,"I generally enjoyed reading this book. It has faults, as many others have pointed out. I agree with most of them, but did not dwell on them since that can ruin any book for the reader, and this book is readable.Why I give the book a low score is because it did not deliver: the power of the chess set at the end did not reflect the power of the chess set at the beginning of the story. In the beginning, King Charlemagne became wary of the chess set, with which he had been gifted, because it caused him to do/say things which were out of character for him and of which he had no memory. In the end, the chess set did not have this ability but was a vehicle, much like a book, for something more mundane in fictional treatments. Though the plot spiraled through many twists, it did not end up on the same note one octave higher."
4,A real Page turner,"I really Loved this book, I couldn't put it down and had to finish it as soon as possible. The story of the Eight is very similar to that of the Da Vinci Code, except it centers around an ancient chess set that was once owneed by Charlamagne. Mebedded in the chess set is an ancient secret that has been protected and passed down for centuries."
3,I like it,"but am finding it difficult to finish it as it revolves around ""chess"" which I like in theory, but know too little about to really appreciate the fine points of this book. I suspect it's a real page-turner for chess players. Well written and articulate book."
2,What a waste of time...,"I was a little upset that this book took forever to finish and when it did it was anticlimactic. I was really upset, hoping for something to happen and then nothing did. Don't get me wrong it had its moments, but not enough of them and not often enough. I kept on reading hoping for something to happen, but nothing ever did. They spent too much time on detail and not enough on excitement. This was like a three hour movie that really should have only been a hour in a half. Two stars that's it. Would never buy this book again."
2,And the point was.....???,"The only reason why I finished this book is because I held out hope (even till the last 10 pages) that the entire 600 pages would actually explain what the whole ""Game"" and ""secret"" was (because there was no POINT to the entire plot - it was almost like 5 year-olds in a sandbox seeing who could collect the most lego pieces, except this was a really really big sandbox), and would have somehow been worth my time. No such luck."
1,"Difficult to follow plot, confusing writing style","I wish I had better things to say about this book, but I have to agree with the reviewer who said that she wished she hadn't spent so much time reading it. The plot is predictable but basing it on chess could have been clever - except that it comes off as contrived. The writer peppers the pages with references to marginally interesting trivia, such as the name of top-end sherry or the makings of a dinner full of Jewish delicacies, but ultimately the storyline depends too much on historical ""shockers"", many of which have been used in other, better-known books and movies. I still would have plowed through except for the writer's tendency to write in a way that, I imagine, makes sense to the author but to few readers. For example, I theoretically understand what she means when she writes of one character not to be ""confused by reason or logic"", but this isn't the kind of book where I want to spend time puzzling over why that phrase is included!"
1,The Absolute Worst,"I've never actually audibly groaned while reading before. This is the worst book I have ever attempted to read. I gave it a good 350 pages worth of effort, but it proved impossible. The prose is horrible and the plot is beyond absurd. The entire premise is based on the worst combination of historical fiction and inane mysticism. Someone with religious brain washing might find this interesting, because the idea that there are magical forces that control human destiny is in keeping with their general world view. If you think you might be amused by Napoleon talking about a magical chess set which can destroy civilization, well then, enjoy! Atheists, brights, rationalists or anyone prone to common sense, beware."
4,"A great, fun read...","I have a question...why do the previous reviews from ""A reader"" and ""Robert Beveridge"" criticize the book for a) not being similar to Umberto Eco and b) not having the sophistication of prose to be considered a good book? All I can say to these two is ""Hey, if you two are such an expert on what makes a great book, why is Katherine Neville the one with a published novel that has sold millions of copies?""...And why does everyone think that liking an Umberto Eco book makes them a sophisticated reader? I bet half these people havent even read, or at least made it past page 30 of an Eco book...Anyway, about THE EIGHT. A great, exciting read, full of characters that you end up really caring about. The two plots that are intertwined, one in the past and one in the present, are both interesting enough that I never minded when the timeline shifted. Not the greatest book ever written, but definitely worth the read if you like adventure"
4,The eight....,Just read this with my husband. It is a great tale weaved by an excellent story teller. All the characters were well developed. A few things I would personally change about the story but for the most part it is a very satifactory story to be read.Two stories weaved around one chess set. Many lives changed by one chess set that can bring ultimate power to the one who owns it. Mystery and intrigue along with love and adventure fills this book. You won't regret reading it.
5,Purely Ingenious!,"The Eight by far is the best book I have ever read! It is a shame it is not more publicized. I think Katherine Neville is a brilliant writer. Her writing is comparable to Dan Brown, but she is a whole lot better. She incorporates the game of chess in a brilliant novel which ends in a very clever twist. Furthermore, she uses characters that are very dynamic and diverse. Her knowledge of history and incorporation of the french revolution and various time periods and icons really adds to the remarkable nature of the book. I THINK THIS IS A WONDERFUL BOOK AND ONCE YOU START YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SET IT DOWN TIL THE VERY END! enjoy!"
4,book-o-holic,totally engrossing. this is the type of book that grabs you from the start. this is the kind of book that keeps you up late at night. Why...because you can't put it down. not only does it go into the history of the Inquisition but it incorporates modern day technology. can't wait for the follow up book.
2,Isn't holding my attention,"I picked up THE EIGHT from my local library looking for a good read. The plot sounded intriquing and fast-paced. With the dual story line going on, I found myself groaning everytime it switched. I pushed through to the end to see if the story line redeemed itself, but never did. I found myself bored with the book early on but thought that was partly due to my lack of understanding of the game of chess but as I read other reviews, it appears not - the book just doesn't have it to hold ones' attention."
3,Good but not great,"I picked this book up on a colleague's recommendation. It is one of the few books written by a woman in recent times that I enjoyed. The author's knowledge of history and geography was startling. The author's bio seems to suggest she is the heroine in the book. The story itself was pretty fascinating. The ending was a definite anti-climax. Good for a one-time read. I will definitely pick up more books by this author though, she has a lot of things to talk about."
2,I'm FINALLY finished...,"It has taken me almost a year and a half to finally complete this frustrating and disappointing literary journey.Why did I even bother you ask? Because from the first moments of this story, the reader is dragged-in by the idea of this mysterious secret formula that is so over-hyped, you feel guilty for not finding out what it is. I should have taken some advice from Harry Burns in ""When Harry Met Sally"" and read the last page first.And by the way, Ms. Neville...we're all so very impressed with your historical name-dropping."
2,Definitely worth passing on.......,"Okay, I am still reading this book (on page 386) but I am like some of the other readers in that I refuse to not finish a book once started, however poorly written. And yes, this is poorly written.Clichéd in many spots (every attempt at character development), awkward, boring, verbose, and you get the point. The only positive thing I have encountered, relative to the book, is that there are many other readers that share my sentiment.""The Eight"" has been translated into fifteen languages. I have no idea why."
5,Thrilling and original!,"I absolutely loved this book! Not only was it action packed, but the characters were well developed, and the structure was perfect. The plot was so creative and I love that it spanned both the globe and centuries. I'll be recommending this book to friends, for sure!"
5,8 is a 10,Katherine Neville has a unique style juxtaposing two different eras into one book.the stroy deal with a mystical chess set and fanctions trying to posses it's secreats.The main characters of both eras are quite interestng and fleshed out.
2,Surprisingly easy to put down.,"This book does not live up to the hype. The excessive name dropping of historical figures gets old quickly. The author tries so hard to keep everything mysterious that the characters are one-dimensional and the solution, when it comes, doesn't seem worth the trouble."
1,One of the worst books I have ever read.,"I suspect that most of the 5 star reviews for this book come from readers of Harlequin romances who think that ""The Eight"" is great literature. After reading the first few chapters, I knew that the writing was horrible, but I continued reading with the hope that the plot would become interesting. Unfortunately, it only became absurd. For example, the characters meet many historical figures, from Napoleon to Benedict Arnold to Catherine the Great, who all know something about the ""secret"" of the Montglane Chess Service. And every historical figure has a ""tale"" involving other historical figures, who know ""formulas"", ""solutions"", and ""secrets"" that nobody else has been able to find. After a few hundred pages, this gets to be very boring and repetitious. The few ""action scenes don't provide any excitement, since there is never any doubt that the heroine will escape. Please, unless you're a Harlequin reader, don't waste your time with this book."
1,An Unrewarding Slog,"The good: excellent story.The bad: poorly written. The clunky Thesaurus-driven prose can be tolerated, but not the wooden and puddle-shallow characters, the dreadful dialog and the absence of a driving and interesting narrative. And it's lonnnnnnng. Not recommended."
5,Comfort book,"The Eight is on a short list of my ""comfort books"", books that I know will reliably distract me when I need to be distracted. Is it great literature? Not even close. But it is an engaging, if totally implausible, story of an epic quest played out in two centuries, one in our time and the other at the time of the French Revolution, drawing all manner of historical figures into a plot centered around a chess set made for Charlemagne that hides a secret (which I won't reveal here) for which people over the centuries have killed and for which others have been willing to die. It is the sheer cleverness of the story and the pluck of the heroines in both centuries that make it work for me. The sequel, The Fire, was just released a couple of days ago and it's the first book I bought to test drive my brand new Kindle. Unfortunately, The Eight isn't available for Kindle, or that would have been my first download."
5,intriguing plot and never a dull moment,"This book was recommended by a friend and I can only agree. This is a fantastic book. The story is very well thought thru. It has just the right amount of History, Chess, Country info, romance, thrill - you name it, its in it.I like the heroine being a computer expert and if you have any interest in economics or finance, you will like some of the tidbits that are being presented (such as the OPEC etc).I almost took up chess after finishing the book, I felt I understood quite some rules I would have otherwise never bothered with.KN also decribes the countries traveled in such vivid colors, it makes you want to see it for yourself. All characters are well developed and I am curious to read the sequel."
4,One of those books that's stayed with me,"I read this book shortly after it came out 14 years ago, and it's stuck with me all these years. I won't say its the greatest book I've ever read - there were definately some slow points and characters that seemed to be a bit TOO odd or maybe even unnecessary - but it is definately a VERY GOOD book, one I would recommend to anyone looking for some nice escapist fiction that can get you thinking in unusual ways. It offers some very nice twists and turns and was quite and enjoyable ride. It's not every book I remember 14 years after first reading it."
4,Worthwhile,"I liked this book, though I wasn't sure at first. It took me a little while to warm up to the characters but once I did, the book really took hold and I was very glad I bought it. A good read. I would recommend it."
1,Infinitely annoying,"It is hard to convey how annoying this book was;I kept thinking it would get better, but it culminated in anti-climax! Every historical personage from the 1700s was dragged into the novel, with no particular reason for being there other than as a hyperactive name-dropping exercise. The contemporary characters were simplistically drawn and cliched. This is certainly NOT Le Carre, Ambler, Furst, Chandler, Deighton, or any number of others... The story wasn't as good as The Da Vinci Code, although it was compared to it (although the writing of the Da Vinci Code is similarly wooden). I kept thinking it would get better, and midway it became simply a challenge to finish it. Don't waste your time or money."
1,Don't Waste Your Time,"This book was recommended to me by three different people and so I looked forward to reading this book. After a few chapters in, I realized that the style of writing was overdone, the plot was ""trying too hard"" and the way the author tried to fit in as many historical characters as possible was undeniably ridiculous. This book would have a lot more interesting had it had a couple hundred pages edited from it's story line. I just wanted the story to end."
2,Delightfully appalling,"This book grew on me. I was initially horrified at the stilted dialogue and astonishingly one-dimensional crew of characters (none of whom are NOT involved in the global intrigue associated with the Montglane Chess Service, from manservant to Minister). When for the twelfth or thirteenth time in as many chapters someone ""went pale"" or ""regarded me as a cat would a mouse"", I was forced to put the book down and reconsider. A few days later I returned to The Eight and a strange thing happened: I began to appreciate it. Admittedly I was relieved when I finished it, but the truth is that this book was something of a guilty pleasure. It's as close to a pulp intellectual detective novel as you are ever likely to find. Comparisons to Foucault's Pendulum or Name of the Rose are way off the mark and only lead to disappointment: This is more Spielberg than Eco. Ignore the awful writing and its Indiana Jones on a mine trolley all the way."
1,Life is too short,"This was a very boring book, recommended to me by a friend. I had absolutley zero sympathy in the characters and a similar interest in the plot, so, by page 180 I decided to call it a day. I know it was published in 1988, but today I felt all the talk of 'secret codes' to be completely infantile.If you want to have your concepts, world-view, personality, destiny or whetever else challenged in any way then do not read this.I sometimes waste time by strumming aimlessly on the guitar. If you like to pass the time by reading something, then this might be the book for you.Oh, and there's just so much bland description about insignificant things that a man can take in one day.I do appreciate how long things take to write though, so I admire her (and anyone's) ability to persevere and get it written and published. This act should be commended.(After all these years of learned criticism, it just comes down to ""It just wasn't my taste."" Unbelievable!)"
2,Horrible,"I must entirely disagree with most reviews of this book as I found it to have one of the most incongruous plots I've ever had occasion to come across. To compare this novel to the ""Name of the Rose"" is an insult to Umberto Eco.Neville has trite prose, and extremely poor character development. I'm surprised I actually had the patience to finish this book...in hindsight, I wish I hadn't.Do yourself a favor, and read ""The Name of the Rose"" if you'd like to read a great novel."
5,One for the Beach,"Fast paced, tense, and tons of fun. Well developed characters and the plot holds together. This is a great adventure novel with lots of intrigue. A great beach read."
5,Omron pedometer is a winner,"The Omron pedometer (HJ-105) has some very nice features. You input the time of day, your weight, the average length of your stride, and it will tell you the total number of steps each day, plus the number of aerobic steps (how does it know? I don't know!), the number of calories expended and the number of miles.The included manual is easy to understand and the interface is intuitive, at least to me.Be careful you don't cut the manual when you cut the industrial-strength plastic case to get at the pedometer. I did, and I had to tape some pages together.It's a good product. I bought ten and am re-selling them to friends who want to lose weight and be healthier.I almost forgot the best part: it resets itself every 24 hours!"
5,Good upgrade over cheap basic ones,I use it for a step program at work. The memory feature is very nice since it allows me to avoid keeping a daily log of my steps. As long as I write down my steps at least once a week I never miss writing them down. You can always review the last 7 days of history.
3,"Not bad, but nothing special.","For just counting steps while walking, this is a decent product. However, it is not totally accurate if you go running. Also, car rides can sometimes increase your step count is the road is a bit too bumpy.The setting for measuring distance is not accurate at all, but I don't really mind.The belt clip is sturdy. I haven't had any problems with it breaking or the pedometer falling off.Also, this pedometer is definitely purple. I'm not sure why they labeled it as ""blue"" when it is without a doubt purple."
5,Useful product,"I've never had a pedometer before but I'm glad I bought this one. This product it's easy to use it has great features and the step count is pretty accurate. I love that it has a calorie counter. The clip is sturdy and stays put on my belt. The price is reasonable, it was a good buy."
1,pedometer,"It didn't last long before it stopped working. We purchased 2 & both broke in a very short time. Extrememly dissapointed that this company made a pedometer that couldn't stand up to normal wear. I wanted it to track my daily walking, & gym activity. Nothing unusual."
2,"Great Start, Disappointing Finish","This product was great when I first bought it! It's fairly accurate and super simple to work and adjust. The only problem I have with this product is that is stopped working after about 45 days of use. Even after 2 different battery changes, I could not get the product to turn on or keep count of my steps. It's a great value for the price but if you plan on working out/monitoring your steps for an extended period of time, spring for the higher quality pedometer."
2,Inaccurate Sensors,"I bought 2 of this for my grandparents as an upgrade to the ones they had from China. I chose this because it had a good price and a decent rating. But after receiving the product, the sensors turned out to be even less accurate than the old ones. I might have just have received defective units so I just simply returned the items with no hassle. Besides the sensors, the device looked nice and the usage was pretty intuitive. My grandparents would have totally liked the device is the main sensor actually worked."
2,As with some othes I got LOW battery life - 1 month ONLY!,"That is simply unacceptable! Granted it's not the most expensive unit out there but it should last more than a month.I did like it's size and it was fairly unobtrustive and not hard to program or read (that gives it the extra star)As for measuring steps it is not as accurate as I wanted anyway. When compared to the treadmill and elliptical machines, both of which give readouts of what you've done in your workout, this unit did not count all my steps. I wore it on the belt area/top of waist. It may be that mine was a dud and the battery was going from the beginning which is why the step count was off - but it really doesn't matter. I'm going to purchase a much better quality unit in the hopes it will last longer! I cannot possibly recommend this unit - although it does sound like others have had better experiences."
2,Didn't work for me,"Kept falling off my belt. Too complicated for what I wanted, which was a simple step counter. And the technology to actually count miles is dependent upon your own accurate measurement of the length of your own stride, which probably will change along with speed, hills, stairs etc. 65 years ago I got that by sending in a Cheerios box top to that company. Or was it Kix?"
4,"Once set up, works great","I bought this for my husband who was trying to walk more, be more healthy. Setup is well explained, but a little time consuming and then when the battery dies (as it did 3 months later), it has to be re setup. I like the week long memory features, steps, weight lost, clock and that it closes to keep from buttons being pressed accidently. I have replaced the battery ($6) but hubs has not reset it to make it functional again, deterred by the setup...When it works, it is terrific, but it doesn't seem to have a long life. Still you can't beat the price!"
2,Disappointing,Couldn't understand it. Took too long to figure it out and then it didn't count my steps that well. Wouldn't recommend.
1,don't waste your money,"I do not recommend this pedometer. It is EXTREMELY difficult to set and read and is not very accurate. I was attracted to it because it in in a closed case (which a previous model was not and it proved to be a problem), however, I still wasn't able to obtain the information that I wanted from a pedometer."
3,instruction manual is lacking,"I just got this product, and I set it up per the instructions. I bought it because it is advertised as being able to count calories burned, but the user manual does not indicate how or where the calorie information is displayed. I am not certain I will see that information at all."
1,Walker,This pedometer is extremely inaccurate. It says you've walked about 1/2 mile less than you actually have. I would not recommend it. What good is it if it cannot keep accurate counts!
3,Typical Oakenfold With a Couple of Twists,"This is Oakenfold's second release for Global Underground (the first being Global Underground 004:Oslo), and has been released with three different album covers.Global Underground: New York follows the tone set by his prior Global Underground album released two years prior. Another eclectic album ecompassing multiple genres of electronica. Unlike GU:Oslo, this compilation is a little lighter on the drum and bass tracks.Disc 1 is predominantly ambient/downtempo mixes with trance. I found none of the tracks to be that gripping. Fairly ordinary set.Other than the opener (nice try Paul, but somehow the gangster D&B; doesn't gel with your image very well), disc 2 is fairly typically of what Oakenfold likes to play. Trance, trance, and more trance. Most of the tracks just don't sound that great when played today.Disc 1 and disc 2, get 3/5 stars."
5,A solid mix by Paul Oakenfold,"Great Paul Oakenfold CD...As a fan of his earlier work, even pre-Transport, since I heard Paul's music from when it first started in the London scene in the early 90s (showing my age here), I have often felt dissapointed by his late releases. Although wonderfully produced, much of his later work does not show the truly outstanding eclectic musical taste that he displayed in early works pre-world fame such as his Essential Mix (later called the Goa mix) and Perfecto Fluoro. The quality of this Cd however is hard to debate. Very good, well crafted, excellently produced, professionally put together mix. One cannot argue with this Cd: if you like trance/house and all the subcategories of this ever evolving genre, this is good. Thats all there is to it. A very good Cd by one of the greatest DJ."
5,-Quintessential-,"If you dig the way trance just gets into your blood, then this set is a great purchase. I have been listening to this disc set constantly for over a year, yet I never tire of it. Oakenfold artfully layers solid grooves and great effects in tracks that pull you into the music and make you want to dance. The transitions are great, building different moods and inspiring you to play the whole CD. Paul Oakenfold is, by far, my favorite DJ. I appreciate all genre of music, but this one consistently makes it to the top of my favorites pile. Great for clubbing; I also love to listen as I exercise. It is a truly welcome addition to any collection."
5,A great title from White Wolf,"Now you too can be one of the rats. Included are the rules for playing as one of the freak aspects, ratkin aspects formed in the modern day which represent some of the most bizarre and awesome characters possible in your troupe. Enjoy this one!"
2,Strange...,"This started out interesting but from a christian perspective, the theology was all wrong. The story became too strange for me because of this. It seemed to mix in new age philosophy with christianity and the story failed for me."
3,Good - agree that is a bit repetitive,"Content Summary and Review: The book is valuable for collecting a variety of different interviews with George Lucas under one cover. There are many interesting perspectives to be found here, however, there is also a great deal of redundant material. One interview in several instances covers much the same material as another, and the repetition can be boring, obviously. If you are interested in finding out about Lucas' Life, the Pollock biography should suffice. Most of the material in this book is also in that one. A few quotes, ideas, perspectives are new here, and of course the major disadvantage is that the book covers only interviews regarding the 1st three movies; no updates for later interviews or articles. So - not bad, informative - but a better, more complete, and less repetitive source of information on Lucas could be produced."
4,It's OK.,"All the songs are good, but I especially like ""It Is A Fine Day"" by Miss Jane. I am also a fan of DJ Encore and Engelina, Ian Van Dahl, Darude, Amber, Madonna, Iio, and Linkin Park. I strongly recomend the album ""Intuition"" by DJ Encore and Engelina. That is my favorite CD of all time. My favorite song of all time is ""Castles In The Sky"" by Ian Van Dahl."
5,Great Stuff,I thought that this cd represents the best of radio trance. It's not for the hardcore fans but more of a collection of great tunes that most people would know from the radio or videos. I love it!!!
4,"I am no trance expert, but I enjoy this cd","I like going to clubs and dancing, and this cd is full of that music that I like dancing to. If you are just looking for some fun dance music, then look no further. There is a ton of bass on this cd, which gives you that club feel. Give it a chance"
4,A Good Compilation CD for Non-technogeeks,"Let's face it, I like techno and alternative music. Unfortunately, these are broad genres. This CD contains mainstream tech-electronica, soft-edged, no fast-tempo drum-n-bass, and is highly listener-friendly. The vocals are mainly female on more than half the tracks if it has vocals: airy, slightly repetitive at times but not boring. I enjoy listening in the car, on my walkman, wherever...it's feel-good music for the techno-masses. An excellent selection for your ""drive to home thru heavy traffic that wont give you road rage"" collection.Most of these you will probably hear at dance clubs, but i havent been to a dance club since ""Little Fluffy Clouds"" by Orb. If I was a DJ, Id play these or seek out alternative mixes of these songs."
3,"Best 'Samplers' of Trance, Volume One","though i enjoyed all of the songs on this cd, the duration of 11 of the songs were 4 minutes or less. i don't own any of these songs on different cds, but i have heard them in clubs and i prefer the duration of the song to be a lot longer. they could have cut a few of these songs out to find better mixes of the songs that were longer in duration. i agree with the person who wrote the review from Deerfield Beadh, FL."
5,Great CD,"If u like techno or trance or music at all? then this CD is well worth it, it is a classic and it is a MUST have. GET it , Got it, GOOD"
2,It's okay...,"Okay, Now I need to change my review again... Originally, I was torn between giving this 2 stars or 3 stars, but oh well, I gave it 2. I did not like many tracks on this disc, however I really liked the songs Beautiful Day and Communication, and a few others are okay also. If you must have this, get it used. I also got Vol 2, it's way better than this. I don't really think this is worth the price."
3,hmmm..,"i bought this one and i just don't love it.the good tracks were:children(robert miles)it's a fine day(miss jane)ayla part 2(ayla)flower duet '99(jonathan peters)rain(brainbug) [not the GREATEST, but it was good.]the BAD tracks were:insomnia(faithless) [AWFUL VOICE]communication(mario piu) [NOBODY WANTS TO HEAR 7 MINUTES OF TELEPHONES RINGING.. I MEAN COMMON!!!]beautiful day(hypertrophy) [MALE VOCALS GONE WRONG]and all of the rest were kinda iffy. if you were in the mood, and too tired to change the song you'd just listen to them. otherwise you'd probably change it. and a few of them aren't EVEN trance.. thank god i bought Volume 2 first. because if i would've bought this one first.. i don't think i would've gone back to ""BEST OF TRANCE."" it's a shame."
1,Don't Let the Pretty Cover Fool You,I am sorry but this album is just not good to me. There's not a single really memorable track in it for me. It is just so forgettable. Don't let the pretty cover fool you....there are far better trance albums out there.
1,Terrible,"I like most trance, but this CD was full of uninteresting and banal songs. I couldn't pick one out from the other as sticking out in my mind except for ""Children"" and ""Insomnia"", which I had heard before on other CDs. Save your money."
1,Don't buy save your money.,"This is garbage. I bought this cd and let some one borrow it i don't even care that it never got returned, actually i am glad they never gave back to me. This is Garbage with the capital ""G"". you may listen to it once and never listen to it again. i know once was enough for me..Save your money..Peace"
1,If you don't truely like the artform your love this.,"I mean, my friends like this cd. I'm the only electronica, techno, crazed kid within 30 miles, it at least seems. I was utterly dissapointed liking really only Its a Fine Day. I don't know why, but I got hooked on it. the other tracks might as well go to the trash. A remix of Till I come would have at least been an improvement. However, the complaints on my music seemed to subside when I putt this in. Most of the time I'm occausted by the people that ride with me over my taste in practically lyric free music. They could sing to this, and do bad dancing moves. Might as well have been a rap cd."
2,"A.K.A. Merlo maschio, Il (1971)","An outrageously silly Italian comedy. A failed musician finds purpose by exposing his wife's body in public places. He first begins by photographing her while she's asleep. The prim wife discovers the photos and leaves him. After they reconcile, she agrees to go along with his wishes. Not surprisingly, the dubbing is handled poorly for this video tape edition. The voice actors sound like slick infomercial hucksters reading from teleprompters. This must have felt dated even back in 1971. Veteran actor Lando Buzzanca plays the husband, and Laura Antonelli is the wife."
4,Great watch,This is a great watch for the price. It serves both a casual and a more dressy purpose. I did not go a full 5 stars because the leather belt looks like it will not stand regular use during a long period of time. Seller delivered promptly and the description was accurate.
5,The Channels represented the best NY Doo Wop,"Hi I just had to respond to that guy from Canada, who doesn't think much of the Channels. You can name the record labels and a bunch of groups including obscure ones. So can I, ever hear of the Mistakes "" I Lost My Job"" Couldn't sing unless drunk. I'm 60 yrs old, grew up in Brooklyn NY and I can say The Channels were one of the best [my personal favorite] doo wop groups.. It's not how many you sold, many stations outside of NYC were not playing doo wop. They were playing the white guys of Phila. A lot of this doo wop was heard either on Alan Freed, or the black stations in NY. Dr. Jive, Jocko were playing strictly doo wop. The Channels were from Brooklyn also as were many of the groups. Back then it wasn't how many were sold it was in what areas. By the way The Flamingoes were from Chicago There were many fine groups back then, but the Channels alone epitomized New York City Doo Wop. Everyone tried to sing their songs."
4,Paul Stupin is an evil genius and Violin Road Rocks!,"Thanks to Paul Stupin, who has caused me to spend more money than I should on music this summer. Fortunately, I have yet to be disappointed. My newest acquirement being Violin Road. I haven't finished the whole album yet, but I know it already that it will be spending an inordinate amount of time in my stereo and in my car. I can't wait to hear more from them."
3,A promising beginning!,"Dr.Christine Radcliffe, a consultant psychologist is peculiarly fitted to asssess and assist her patients as a once abused child herself.When the bodies of two of her colleagues are discovered, she and the police begin to unravel a tortuous web involving child abuse at a former childrens shelter. I felt that this thread wasn't followed through sufficiently to explain the systematic abuse and who was involved with it.Regardless of this omission, the story is pacy enough to keep going and involves many interesting character studies along the way."
3,Not the color as pictured,"In fairness, the small description print does say ""brushed steel"" though the picture shows more of a bronze color with slithgly tan glass. If you are going by the picture as I did, you will be getting something very different in color, a grey fixture with white glass.It's still a nice fixture and installation was fairly easy, however if you are matching a theme in your kitchen, make sure you want a grey fixture with white glass and not the more spanish looking design as pictured (which is what we were hoping for)"
5,It's about time,I knew they would release this after everybody bought the reg. 2 disc on here for $25... How about releaseing the series box set???????????????
3,"OK, but not worth the wait.","PhantasmandPhantasm 4: Oblivionare two of my favorite horror movies. It had been years since I'd seen part II and was glad to see it was finally being released in US DVD format.After watching this movie I have to say it wasn't as good as I thought it had been. It's very atmospheric with all the towns being desolate and the cemetery graves empty, but didn't really add anything to the series.If you feel you need to own it to complete the series, go for it. Otherwise, just rent it."
3,An fine sequel.,"Nine years ago The Tall Man (Angus Scrimm) though he has killed Micheal Pearson (James LeGros replacing A. Micheal Baldwin) is now all grown up. Micheal is planning to killed The Tall Man with the helped of his friend Reggie (Reggie Bannister). The two embark on a dangerous mission with a young woman (Paula Lrvine) to stop The Tall Man.Written and Directed by Don Cascarelli (Phantasm Series, The Beastmaster, Kenny & Company) made an good Sequel but the film has an weak lead performance by Legros & it`s also has a little too much of humor but Phantasm fans will love it. Grade:B."
3,nothing new,"it arrived within days of ordering and was in excellent condition. I was missing II and III from my collection, so it was nice to watch them and see how the Phantasm world fell apart. Nothing new, some interesting situations. A great B movie!"
2,The continuing adventures of Reggie and Mike,"Phantasm 2 is loads of fun, and Coscarelli keeps very faithful to the ""Phantasm"" world he created. James Le Gros does a credible job of playing a more buffed up Mike. And Reggie is everyone's favorite ice cream dude with the 4 barreled shotgun...watch for the cool chainsaw war he has with one of the Tall Man's henchmen. The Tall Man, played by the legendary Angus Scrimm is at his sinister best, and one imagines Mother Angelica from the Catholic Channel fainting as he tells a hapless priest,""You think when you die you go to Heaven....?...You come to US!!!!""One of the coolest and best lines in all the 4 films. Mike and Reggie do their best to score hot chicks in this one, but the Tall Man ruins everything as usual. The death of the Tall Man is one of the coolest horror scenes you'll ever see, very imaginative and gory. But death is not the end...Because its not a dream...No, its NOT!...Highly recommended."
1,"A waste of money, time and space","This movie has to be one of the worst movies ever created. It brings a new meaning to the phrase senseless violence. It simply doesn't make sense. Apparently a fat man (I'm sorry, tall man) runs around with silver flying balls drilling into peoples' heads. The hero is an overweight and balding ice cream vendor and his goofy side kick. This is not a horror movie. It was either a bet among studio executives to see if a sequel could be made or the director had a very, very bad acid trip. Words fail me in describing how bad this movie was. Let me put it this way: it makes Waterworld look like a movie of great depth with subtle nuances."
4,GREAT DANCE SINGLE FOR 2002,"I like everyone else heard this song on the ubiqtious Mitsubushi commerical with all the passenagers getting their ""groove on"".It sounded like one of those dance songs you'd hear late night at a tamer rave.But I liked it.So this morning,I see the video on VH1 and I came to like it.The video's concept of a breakdancer who breakdances his life away on the street corner after his girlfriend leaves him is quite clever,I must say and is a good vibe for the song.This song is reministic of those dance songs from 1997,the year when MTV and major labels got more hip to dance music.The year of the Chemical Brothers,Roni Size,Propellerheads,Death In Vegas...I could go on.""Days Go By"" could be a big crossover pop hit.It's good that advertisers are using unknown dance/techno songs in their national TV ad campaigns because it opens a music fan's ear to a song they usually wouldn't hear..."
1,More pop garbage,"I think its funny how many people are into this, just because its in a car commercial. This song is third rate compared to much of the dance that came out last year. Of course those songs weren't in catchy commercials...Go ahead and keep eating up what ever the mainstream tosses you and act like you are the unique little flower who picked this as your favorite song.I preferred these guys as the Hydrogen Rockers, before they softened up and sold out."
5,If there were 10 stars I would give 20,By far the best song on any commercial.I would love to thank Dirty Vegas for putting that song out there. I love it. I stop whatever I am doing to listen to that song when it comes on the tv. I love you guys for making that song!!! You ROCK!!!!! Keep the wonderful music coming and you'll have a fan for life!
4,Wanna see the Video?,"Great song and interesting video. Got to give Kudos to the Mitsubishi people for using this song and the other songs(Wiseguys and Groove Armada, etc) in previous commercials... Hope you enjoy it!!!"
5,One of the best reggae discs I've heard!,"Bought this disc on the advice of a lovely lady who was giving me rasta braids while on my honeymoon in Jamaica. Wow! What a fabulously fun, romantic set of songs. An irie trip, spliff or no spliff..."
4,"Not 6"" Wide - well actually it is","Original Review - The jaws open to about 2"" and not the 6"" implied in the name of the piece. None the less - one of the widest doweling jigs I've used and good quality for the money.New Review - So you have to love this - weeks after I received it and pretty soon after posting my first review - the seller read my review and made a point of emailing me to apologize - because they had sent the WRONG jig. I should have been sent a 6"" opening jig!! They arranged replacement with the correct item.For some reason I can't edit this up to 5 stars. But ignore the implied critisism of my first review! This seller means business and customer care for a $20 item is clearly important to them."
5,great tool,"This jig helped me do straight drilling to put up a lattice screen on my back porch. Without it, it would have been impossible, or danged lucky, if I were to drill an even somewhat perpendicular hole through 4x6 posts and about five more inches of boards and trex. As it is, thanks to effective drilling, I have a pretty ""square"" bit of work. The cost of the jig was well worth the aggravation is saved me, the time it saved in getting the job done well, and it came quickly."
2,A Mixed Bunch,"There are some great songs (Pooh doing his Up-Down exercises, Let's Go Fly a Kite, and of course the Dwarves), some real unknowns that turned out to be good (the little boy's cowboy dream song), and some that I found frankly disturbing (a song by pirates about the fun of pillaging that includes footage of pirates chasing women around a house, and the Siamese cat song--the subtites make it quite clear that it is a very negative Asian stereotype). I fast-forward through these songs...."
5,Snow White-Heigh Ho,"So, what's the catch? I have seen Disney Sing-Along-Songs videos for a long time. Some of them are Zip-A-Dee-Doo-Dah, The Bare Necessities, Friend Like Me, Circle of Life, etc., etc. So now to the basics of the songs.""Heigh Ho""-Snow White""Up, Down and Touch the Ground""-Winnie the Pooh & the Honey Tree""Hi Diddle Dee Dee""-Pinocchio""The Dwarfs' Yodel Song""-?""A Cowboy Needs a Horse""-A Cowboy Needs a Horse""The Three Caballeros""-The Three Caballeros""Theme From Zorro""-Zorro movies""Let's Go Fly a Kite""-Snow White""Yo Ho""-?""Siamese Cat Song""-Lady and the TrampJust buy it. Nothing good may come of it anyway."
3,Sing Along Value,"When this video was released it had high value because it had scenes from Snow White which had never been released on video before. Now though Snow White has been released on video and DVD, so it isn't so highly praised. Still, it is nice sing along fun for the kids featuring many of the old time Disney classics for the adults."
5,THE BEST IN ALL TIME CHIDREN'S VIDEO,I CONSIDER SNOW WHITE SING ALONG HEIGH-HO TAPE A FAMILY FAVORITE. IT BRINGS OUT THE CHILD IN EVERY ADULT. A WONDERFUL ACTION PACKED TAPE FILLED WITH HUMOR AND JOYFUL MUSIC FOR THE YOUNG AND THE OLD. DON'T COME HOME WITHOUT IT.
4,Good Overview,"This is a great introductory book on Six Sigma for Service. It is very high level, and covers a significant amount of material in 500 pages. You could be completely new to the Six Sigma concept, pick up this book, and understand. Likewise, if you are familiar with the Six Sigma methodology, this book will help you think through the challenges and opportunities of implementation in a services based environment.However, if you are looking for a detailed, how-to manual, this is the wrong tool. A good, approachable and digestable read. I would have rated a five star except it is a challenging value proposition at this price..."
5,Amazon Love Story,"Combining the four phases of love with a wildlife ""picture book"" sets this coffee table book apart. A compelling narrative of the author's love affair with the Amazon jungle is woven around the striking photographs. Uplifting, beautiful, spititual, and fun. Buy it for the photographs, but read the text!"
3,"Not Perfect, But Interesting None-The-Less","It's hard not to have great expectations of a DVD that boasts tours through some of America's majestic National Parks.""Touring Through Great National Parks: Volume One"" is interesting, well researched and does offer terrific visuals of many of America's natural treasures, but it does tend to be a little slow in pace and the audio quality, which tends to sound a little muffled now and again, could have been better.Visually, it's hard to go wrong with images from parks like Arches, Acadia, Olympic and the Rocky Mountains, but if you're spoiled by the breathtaking IMAX 70 mm film, you'll be a little disapointed by the picture quality on this DVD.Overall, ""Touring Through Great National Parks: Volume One"" is great for nature fans and frequent visitors to these parks, but isn't an essential DVD to own if you're looking for superior picture and sound."
4,Great Video,"Although the picture could have been better, the video was very interesting. Watching this will absolutly make you want to visit these parks. The footage is spectacular. The best ones by far are Glacier and Rocky Mountain National Parks."
3,Reads like a College Text Book,Pretty good information in the book but not a real enjoyable read. It was a bit boringly written. The end.
1,Not what I expected at all,"I purchased this product under the assumption that it was an actual mousepad...it isn't. It's just a piece of paper that looks like it was cut out by hand. It was meant to be a gift for someone, and I was embarrassed to give it to him. Save your money. Just print out a picture of a Yin Yang and cut it out with scissors instead."
4,"Problems with light, but otherwise great","After a while the light started to flicker in and out, but the glass was beautiful. My friends thought it was totally cool that I could light up my gloss for application inside of dark parties, and I loved how there was a mirror attached to the side."
3,"Nice graphics, unchallenging gameplay","This game is great to look at--the trains, fields, and other graphics are beutifully rendered, as are a few video ""cut-scenes."" The games themselves are not very challenging and left my Thomas-crazed four-year old bored after a few times through--but he still plays it once it a while to hear the music and watch the characters. Better for smaller kids."
1,Poor compatibility,"Be careful. When they say Windows 95/98, they mean it. It doesn't run on Win2k. My son is very disappointed. He loves Thomas.Other Hasbro games, including Barney, run well on win2k, so we expected this one to work as well."
5,A Great Book to Teach From...,I taught an undergraduate course in probability and stochastic processes last summer using this book. This book is so clearly written and laid out that for the first time in 20 years of teaching I could lecture directly from the book rather than having to spend the time to make up a set of notes. The many worked out problems are very helpful in illustrating concepts. All in all a great book.
1,How is this getting good reviews?,"So from a student that actually is using this book, this is terrible. Very few examples, skimming over content, and no answers! WHAT GOOD IS THIS BOOK IF YOU ONLY USE IT TO GET YOUR HOMEWORK PROBLEMS FROM THE CLASS?! I've learned more from searching wikipedia on the subject than reading this book. Maybe schools should choose books based on their content and their help to students rather than some sort of corporate money game with the book companies. I could only imagine those are the people giving this book a good review, or they have never even cracked it open and tried to learn probability for their first time from it. Thank you for teaching me nothing and wasting my time."
2,Very Basic,"This is a very basic book. It goes very fast and I think it rushes through its most important first chapter on ""Experiments, Models and Probabilities"" in 30 pages, even though this chapter is usually covered in 6 weeks in a normal college class.In the preface, the authors stress how important it is to practice with as many probability problems as possible, yet this book does not let you do that. It does have many problems, but without the answers. Only teh few quizzes in the text have answers, besides the explanatory examples. I would have at least liked to see answers at the back to the odd-numbered problems after every chapter.So far the price I paid for this book, I am very disappointed"
5,Great little known Electronica/Punk/Pop Band from Down Under!,"If you're the kind of person who likes Fischerspooner, Thrill Kill Kult, or '80s industrial style dance music meet your new favorite band! I was introduced to these guys from THE FEAST OF FOOLS podcast (available on iTunes for free), and got hooked as they sampled each track from this amazing CD. They aren't huge here in America, but well worth seeking out. Definitely give it a spin. It's not about the money, it's all about the fluffy bunny."
5,KILLER DVD......,"If anyone out there doesn't know who Rory Gallagher is,then pick up this dvd and get converted! It's that simple! Great performer and killer guitar player.....MUST BUY THIS!!! Well,what are you waiting for anyway??"
4,Memories Flood Back,"Interesting CD - I remember the song when I was in junior high in Arlington Hts., Ill and swooning over it back then. The CD, of course, has much sharper sound that did my 45rpm but I was instantly taken back to winter afternoons dancing to a stack of 45's with the beautiful 8th grade women at Miner Jr. High. The CD didn't disappoint!"
5,My Review,"The IUM4A1B, a very impressive airsoft gun. It sounds great and fires fast. Everything arrived in one piece, very sturdy gun. The hop-up is a little hard to adjust, a little problem not worth mentioning, but would just like to point it out. The strange thing is...it came with a attachable hand grip, but there wasn't a RIS rail on the foregrip except for the upper reciever. It is very accurate and the front and rear sights are adjustable. Mine, however, did not come with the special tool needed to adjust the front sight, but i think its not included to begin with. The manual was amazingly readable! it came with a layout of the entire gun showing different parts (internal and external parts) of the rifle. This is one of my favorite guns because it looks, feels, and performs great, I recommend this to anyone into airsoft."
4,DJ Craze - 2xDMC Technic World Champ Turntablist shows off.,"DJ Craze has won the famed DMC Technics DJ World Championships in NYC twice--no doubt he's a great turntablist. THe album begins with more hip-hoppy, fast and furious scratchy tune. You can hear him scratch the vinyls. It's pretty amazing. The rest of the album sounds mostly dark, drum & base-y.. Perhaps, the jungle tunes played on a bit too long. There's no ""progression"" in rythm and theme, like LTJ Bukem's. It's a pretty good album, but not great and his talent isn't really shown here."
2,Should have been better,"Dj Craze is an awesome turntablist, and I was overly excited when I heard that he was doing a d&b alblum. It really turned out pretty mediocre though. There was some scratching at the beginning, but that was about it. I guess I was expecting him to pull more tricks out of the bag. What you have left is a run of the mill d&b mix."
3,"Knitting on the Edge: Ribs, Ruffles, Lace, Fringes, Floral, Points & Picots: The Essential Collection of 350 Decorateive Borders","It's OK. I bought it, but could have lived without it. The sections include: Introduction, Texture, Size, Notes, Ribs, Ruffles, Lace, Fringes, Flora, Points & Picots, Patterns, Stitches, Abbreviations, Techniques, Acknowledgments, & Recourses.This is an excellent book for beginner or intermediate knitters. Experienced knitters would have already used many of these ideas in their self-designed knitted project. It's a nice reference book for them."
5,Wonderful reference book,"The variety and styles that the author has designed are numerous enough that it should satisfy a variety of tastes - it certainly earns its five stars. Nicky Epstein's unique knitting artistry is well reflected in this book. The swatches are clearly made (details of stitches are easily seen), the categories are numerous, the styles range from easy to complex work. I especially like the format of the book - layout is clean and readable (like when you have it open while knitting), and the projects in the book give you a basic idea how to use the edgings.It DEFINITELY is a good addition to one's knitting reference library. The author has a prior book with some of same edgings but this book is unique enough and full of very useful things to make the purchase well worth it."
4,Positive,The book gives a lot of ideas to finish or to start a project. The pictures are clear for you to see the patterns.
2,Fraught with Mistakes!,"While the designs and photographs in this book are absolutely beautiful, I don't know if any of the reviewers actually tried knitting anything. The book is filled with mistakes and typos! I tried to contact the publisher, but there is no listing in New York for Sixth & Spring Publishing. I finally found a phone number in a knitting magazine. They were not very pleasant, but did tell me to contact ""webmaster@sohopublishing.com"" to get the corrections. The book does have a disclaimer about mistakes, but they should have tried knitting from their own instructions before publishing this expensive book!"
2,It does have mistakes,"I agree with other reviewers who pointed out the mistakes on the instructions. I bought the book recently and tried to chart the butterfly pattern on page 139 with no success, even and odd rows have a different number of stitches (and no, there are no increases or decreases involved).So, good for inspiration, but you are better equipped with Barbara Walker's ""treasuries""."
2,Where are the corrections????,"There are many mistakes in this book...and it is poorly written. Patterns should be more clear. One person stated she couldn't find any errors...well I beg to differ with you, so far every pattern I've started has errors and have not been able to complete either project because of them. what is up with P1 P5...????? why not p6????? I do not understand that and have never seen it before....crazy"
4,r2Pota2,"It's a great toy to go with the other star wars potato head toys. Probably more for comic enjoyment than role playing or educational value. It'd be nice if all of them hade a sound chip to make the noises from star wars. It is well-built like all the potato heads, but not alot of interchangeable parts. Overall alot of fun for star wars fanatics."
1,What a Waste,"This sounded cute, so I bought it for my three year old grandson. There is nothing to it. There a so few different pieces that it is useless. I actually should return it, but it's such a hassle..."
5,I luv R2D2,"I collect R2D2s, so had to have this one. Missed out when it made its way thru the stores, so was glad to still find it on line.I have everything from salt and pepper shakers to 3D puzzles, but needed the potato head.Would enjoy having all the potato head line, but time and expense prohibit that, so will settle for adding this one to my R2D2 collection."
4,Chaos is fun!,"At the time of typing this review, I have not yet completed the game. Though, so far, I have found it quite fun. The levels are designed quite well, and the AI has caught me off guard a couple of times. The rookie level isn't to easy, like most games, but I haven't tried the harder difficulties yet.There are a few timed missions that you have to rush through, but they are optional. The upside to doing these is that you unlock new weapons/upgrades and such.The controls are easy to remember, and well laid out.The graphics are nice, I wouldn't compare them to BLACK, but it has more... Depth? To it.The riot shiled is a great part to the game, it helps a LOT.If your looking for a good game to spend some of your spare time on, I would definately recommend this!"
5,Behavioral made bearable,"Not a big fan of behavioral science, but this book makes it bearable by focusing on what you'll be tested on and helping you distinguish similar conditions from each other. Good biostatistics section also included. Great information and great figures to help you understand the info. Strongly recommend - the rest of the series is also outstanding."
5,Know these Vignettes,"Know these Vignettes! Nothing more to say. They will be tested over. Period :) Terribly boring subject, but points are points."
5,Must-Have for the Camco RV Grill,"This bag is a high-quality necessity for protecting and storing The Camco grill I ordered for my son's birthday. It is very sturdy and fits the grill perfectly. It has pockets for storing the hoses, regulator, etc, so the entire grill and connections stay clean and organized. It is very sturdy and dust wipes off easily. It's a much better way to store the grill for transport to your favorite camping destinations than a cardboard box, plastic bag or other ways it could be stored. We are very happy with this purchase."
1,Not a good product.,I ordered this as a companion for my new Olympian stainless grill and had to return it. The first time I placed the grill inside and zipped it shut the corner of the grill cut right through the bag. The bag is very thin and rips with the slightest pressure. I would not recommend it.
1,"Good product, bad customer service!",Good product but you can't return or exchange items easily therefore I would not buy another product from this seller.
1,Not waterproof,"Socks are not waterproof as advertised on amazon. The packaging does not actually use the word waterproof. Packaging says ""blocks water"", and ""water-hating"". When I place the socks in running water, water penetrates the seams easily as they are not sealed. The packaging claims to seal in heat, but I haven't tried it while wearing, so I'm not sure if it's a valid claim.It seems to be water repellent and pretty good if not in standing water, but I would think if your shoes are wet, the water will eventually wick into the socks.Also, Medium is too small for me as I wear size 9US shoes."
2,Waterproof for a day.,"I do not know what happened. When I got those socks, they were very good and seemed ro repell all the water out, preventing anything form going in. I do not know what happened, but it has been two weeks and the socks are no longer water proof! I only wore it once prior to this...I put them on today and water was going in like it was cotton. The only possible explanation I have is that I must have streched when putting it on (they fit in very tight if the sizing guide is correct) causing the pores to open--but still!!!I haven't washed them or anything like that. I plan on calling seirus but I doubt customer service will have any answer. With that said, buy it at your own risk. They would definitely be worth it if they remained functional. In my case, $30 was a waste."
3,Waterproof Socks,"The socks work pretty good. I had hoped that they would be more waterproof. I read electric meters in a rural area. Walking across wet lawns and fields get my shoes quite wet in a eight hour day. I had hoped that with the waterproof socks, I would not have to wear heavy boots as shoes are more comfortable for as much walking I have to do (approx. 7 miles per day),"
2,Stormschmuck,"I use these on cold, windy, wet days when riding a bike in Western Siberia. I put it over a wool sock. I got the XL and it's a good size and easy to get off or on but looks like it might tear eventually.Not sure how long they will last, but at the price, I hope for 12 years at least. Stiching wear/tear might be an issue. Waterproof is an issue for me since I need protection from the cold, wet, wind.Update: Worthless product, does nothing for either the wind, wet or cold. Used with 2 wool socks, still had freezing feet. Buying this was like using my cash to light a cigar with. Very unhappy with the product."
1,Not worth it.,"I ordered these socks thinking they would be waterproof. Once I received them, i put them on and dipped my foot in water. To my dismay, my foot was wet. I tried to return them but there was a restocking fee of $10. I paid $22. So you get back only half the money."
3,NOT waterproof and on the small size,"Pros:Comfortable if a bit snugWarmCons:Difficult to removeNot waterproofIf you wear the size on the upper edge of their sizing chart cutoff, I would suggest you get the larger size - I wear a women's 8.5 or 9 and it was quite a chore to get them off. I don't know where the four-way stretch they mention on the package is.The package I bought didn't say waterproof, water resistant or anything about water (there was a photo background of the Andes), so I put them on, turned on the faucet and put my foot under it. Immediately the water seeped into the seam which was stretched by my size 9 foot (ah, the stretch is in the SEAM), so not water anything."
2,Does not work,I have put on these socks and walked during the rain to check. Both of them were full of water. At some level of rain it does not work very well.
3,Simple Gear makes all the differance,Makes playtime in the snow a lot more comfortable when your feet can breath and your able to keep your feet from getting soggy!
2,Lake Socks,I had to return these as they were not flexible enough to fit over my high arch on my feet. They were also much thinner than I thought they would be. Just did not work for my application where I needed thermal protection against cold lake water.
1,Something Smells,I was happy to receive my book so quickly. Unfortunately the cover was not in as good a shape as I had hoped it had some mold on it and the book smelled very musty. Went on line to get some tips to get rid of the smell. None of them have worked. Can not put with the rest of my book for fear they will pick up the smell. I would like to return but can not find my paper work.
2,CLASSIC FILM OF THIS GENRE,"As a film maker, I had to own a copy of the only film in history to earn a billion dollars in box office and DVD sales. Funny thing is, with all those copies out there, I don't know any one who has it (or will admit they do).There is a somewhat comedic plot to this film (albeit a very thin plot) that sets it apart from the typical x-rated film. Most x-rated films have only one purpose, and plot ain't it. If that's what you're into, this film isn't very good cinematically in that regard. What strikes me is that something so poorly made and so cheap to produce can outsell a multi-million dollar blockbuster Hollywood production.If you buy it, share it with friends and a beer for a solid hour of laughter."
1,Lousy!,"I could have ordered this porn movie from the gates of hell, in care of the gates of heaven, and it would have gotten here sooner. I haven't gotten any notice that it has been shipped but did notice the money disappeared from my bank account the next day. What would you think?"
3,I didn't know you could do that,"Talk about an eye opener or at least an opener, this classic that should have been lost in time and become an obscure fact, seems to have raised its ugly head again.Basic story line is Linda (born Linda Boreman in 1949) suspects that she is not getting everything she wants out of life. She makes an appointment with MD Dr. Young (Harry Reems). She discovers through the medical of nature that part of her anatomy seems to have been placed in a differing physical location.The bulk of the movie is Linda taking advantage of her new found discovery.I suppose there will always be generations of the curious. But this should be a mild film compared to just the nightly news broadcast.This film may make an interesting coffee table conversation. Other than that I now say leave sleeping dogs lie.Be aware that there are reports of recent copies of this film that seem to have distorted or removed the pertinent scenes."
1,hardcore,way too much... unless you like dirty .. dirty this is not for you. Sent it back and got a refund
4,A really terrific book,I read this book just out of bible school and really resonated with it even though the story took place a couple of generations before. I strongly recommend it for people who have been involved in or are interested in conservative Christianity. Too bad it is out of print. I've loaned out my copy and never got it back.
5,Raw Sammy,"I loved Red Voodoo, but Ten 13 has a whole new sound to it...it's raw! Sammy said this disc is exactly what he wanted. Shaka Doobie and Let Sally Drive are both strong, driven hard rockers that lay the ground work for a great disc.I look forward to seeing Sammy and the Waborites jam this new disc live at the Des Moines Civic Center."
3,Ten 13,"Made loud to play loud, hey Sammy turn down the volume & save my speakers. Seems to have a harder edge to it like Mas Teqila. I'd say Motorhead move over"
4,Seeing RED again!,"This cd is a mavel but the bad news first ... I do not like the title track. 10/13 is not only NOT a good song but not even close to holding the title track honors, and is 1 of only 2 songs I feel that is somewhat sub-par. But the majority of the songs are flat out good and that is the important thing. Sammy really seems to be cooking these days, he has certainly surrounded himself with a tight group and has bested Van Halen on every attempt since leaving. (...) This cd is not as good as ""Marching"" though is a definate improvement over the ""rushed"" feel of his last effort. ... , but this cd seems to have a nice touch without the Clink-master. ... definately needs to implement a ""1/2"" star because I may have given this 4 1/2 ... ... . Sammy is where he belongs, in control."
3,Red Rocker's Birthday!,"Made in CAN in 2000, Serial# 63985-78110-2, Playing Time 47:36This album celebrates Sammy's birthday, and it's quite a party-themed album. A logical follow-up to ""Red Voodoo"".Sammy says in the liner notes that he's very critical of his singing; I think that on this album, he's pushing the envelope even further, and it works. This album rocks, like all of SH's albums. Most tracks present solid performances, but I personnally found it a bit ""conservative"": no real scorcher like ""There's Only One Way To Rock"" or ""Reckless"". Still, there are some very typical SH moments on the record, and overall, it's an enjoyable and rocking experience.There's also a ""hidden"" track of about 2:30 at the end of track 11 where Sammy plays what sounds like a banjo; quite unexpected, but still catchy.It's not my favorite SH album: I'm still partial to ""Standing Hampton""; but I still prefer ANY song on this CD over ANY song from VH3."
4,Business Reading,As a student in the college of business I found this a great resource. This book was helpful in adding to my library. There are many useful tools contained in these pages.
5,Cultural dimensions,This is a truly seminal work in a modern setting. Prof. House and his colleagues built on Geert Hofstede's work and advanced it to a newer plateau.
1,Tossed Eggs and Scrambled Salad,"First off, I am a huge fan of Frasier and have all the DVDs that have been released to date, as well as a number of books containing scripts of the best episodes. I also like various types of Jazz, and so thought this compilation would be a great idea.This CD is, however, an appalling waste of money. The music tracks are mismatched; the tracks do not flow into each other smoothly; the portions of dialog are not the cleverest (or best) and do not make me laugh at all. It is a poor mish-mash of badly matched content.If you do like Frasier I suggest you save your money and buy this instead:http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/1557044031/qid=1130513951/sr=2-1/ref=sr_2_11_1/026-7816557-2011659If you like Jazz, do yourself a favour and buy this:http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000024F6G/qid=1130514104/sr=2-1/ref=sr_2_11_1/026-7816557-2011659Total of about 12, or the same as the price of Tossed-Egg CD thingy in the first place."
2,Great scenery and music but poor story and bad acting,"Although Secret of the Andes suffered from a badly developed story and the acting was generaly bad, the wonderful scenery and uplifting music had me watching it again and again."
4,This Reunion ROCKS!,"This little gem orginally came packaged with a VHS tape that documented the Boss' reunion with the legendary E Street Band to record some new tracks to add to the ""Greatest Hits"" CD Springsteen was assembling.For the hard-core fan, this is a must-have as it contains three new cuts - two alternate takes of songs that made the Greatest Hits CD and one that appears here for the first time.I actually prefer this version of ""Secret Garden"" as I find the string & chime ending adds a much more sorrowful mood to the piece than Clarence's excellent, but mellow saxophone on the ""official"" mix.And I love ""Without You,"" an old-fashioned goofy rave-up with Bruce & Company in full Gary US Bond mode. I actually wish ""Without You"" had made the Greatest Hits package instead of ""This Hard Land.""You also get a live recording of ""Murder, Incorporated"" so all-in-all this is almost an all-new compilation.Highly recommnded."
2,Crickets don't like it much,"My crickets don't like this gutload much; wetting it doesn't seem to make it more appealing. I ended up making my own gutload for the crickets to feed to my chameleon - which was insanely time consuming, but it was fun to hunt in the health food store for the ingredients and it makes quite a ton of gutload (there's a wet and a dry that you can mix) and the rest you can freeze till you need it: [...] Just my experience though, you may like this product or find a different recipe that works."
4,The Jive Five Greatest Hits,The CD is very good.......I would say 80% of the hits are on it. My husband really enjoys it
2,Another botched job from Vanguard?,"There is nothing wrong with the movie: the 1970s were not easy on the eyes, but for who likes kitsch, good dialogue, a nicely tight plot , the amazing Jean Gabin and the ever charming Danielle Darrieux, L'Annee Sainte holds its own beautifully in the French soft gangster genre. BUT but but: where on earth did the producers of this DVD get their print? The thing looks picked up straight out of a badly pirated TV screen, complete with fuzz and shaky images, and as for the the ""English subtitles"" (that cannot be turned off, by the way), they are hideously laughable (when they are present at all: sometime, entire bits of dialogue are left untranslated, and sometime the translation comes in... ohmigod: Spanish!). Hello: this is a DVD, not your dad's old VCR copy frenzy!"
3,Better to have a PC,This product is best for a PC user. My MAC OS X does not interface well. The functionality and clarity of display are very good.
5,"If this is the one with the ""trick or treat"" episode, 10 *s","If this is the one with the ""trick or treat"" episode on it, it is, without any doubt at all, one of the best of the best of the Tales series!!! The graphics are outstanding and the story line is really slick. If this were in print, I'd buy it in a minute. Makes a great Halloween party vid."
3,GENDER-PERSONALITIES BEGIN IN CHILDHOOD,"Letty Cottin PogrebinGrowing Up Free:Raising Your Child in the 80's(New York: McGraw-Hill, 1980) 641 pagesThe regrettable gender-personalities begin in childhood:Boys are enculturated to be interested in sports.Girls are enculturated to be concerned about their appearance.These pressures come first from parents and later from peers.Once we realize what we are doing to our children,we can choose a different path, attempting to help them becomemore Authentic rather than more popular with their peers.If you would like to discover other books on gender development,search the Internet for the following bibliography:""Best Books on Gender-Personality"".James Leonard Park, creator of the Gender-Pattern Chart."
4,In praise of paper?,"There are copious amounts of research on how people interact with computers or machines. However, there is very little research on all the hidden features of paper. ""The Myth of the Paperless Office"" brings attention to how office workers actually organize their information needs. In many ways, it's probably a pioneering work in computer usability, even though it doesn't specifically deal with computers, but rather anthropological research on the use of paper in organisations.This book can be very useful for anyone. Especially for designers of computer systems that wonder why people still stick to yellow labels and printouts, even its technically ""inefficient"", compared to a digital solution. Its also recommended reading for bosses that plan to implement a ""clean desk policy"", or employees that are wondering how to get around clutter on their desks.For an excellent review of the book, read the article ""In praise of clutter"" from The Economist Magazine (Dec 19th 2002)"
5,Exactly what I was looking for,I have been looking for at least three years for a clothes rod that could be used for a makeshift closet. When I read the reviews for this product I ordered three.I used two to turn a cubby in my basement into a make shift closet. The rods are holding near maximum weight and they have stayed in place for several weeks now. The two that are in the closet are extended to their longest length. The only complaint is that at this extension the clothes tend to move to the middle of the rod and make it bow a bit.The third rod I used in my laundry room to hang wet clothes. It's not extended very far and there is no movement of clothes or bowing at all.Overall I have been using these for several weeks and they are holding up nicely. None have fallen down. I also used them without the screws so they are not slipping. I will probably order several more. For the price they have exceeded my expectations.
1,If only it worked,"We ordered this rod to hang a blackout curtain in our bedroom without damaging the walls. It looked plenty sturdy to hold one width of (somewhat heavy) fabric. Sadly, while the length does vary between 37"" and 63"", we couldn't lock it at just any width-- 46"" for our window didn't work. My husband tried duct-taping it, which lasted for maybe 1 1/2 months, but it's fallen down. We'll find some other type of rod to replace it."
3,Great.... but too bad her voice is processed,"Good lively ghazals. Sound quality wise, while the instruments sound natural Najma voice is processed and dynamically compressed. Not even sure she was there with the musicians. Too bad that her great voice is compromised on this recording. Lowered my rating on voice quality."
5,"Understated Elegance, Outstanding Quality","This is my second Tissot watch. I purchased my first Tissot in Geneva 20 years ago. This watch is simply beautiful and is a knockout with a suit. It is thin, which is what I wanted since I hate having watches getting snarled in my shirt cuff. This is a watch that makes you feel good when you wear it because it is a classic. It could be worn with business casual, but I chose to purchase this watch for job interviews because it is such a beautiful dress accessory to a nice suit. It is elegant and refined and has a well made look and feel to it. This is not a clunky ""wrist anchor"" watch, which is what I didn't want. If you are looking for classic understated elegance and good quality (I agree that it is comparable in look to a Patiek Philipe...sorry for the spelling), then I highly recommend this beautiful timepiece."
5,Stunning,Finally a great watch! I am ver happy w this gorgeous time peice! Get one it's a lifter! Makes me fell good!
5,Very nice watch,"I am very pleased with this watch. I am not really a ""watch"" person so I was looking for something light and not too bulky and this is perfect. Even going from not wearing a watch, you can barely notice that you have it on. The styling is also great, a very classic/classy look. It is definitely a bit smaller than most watches you will see so I would recommend trying to get an idea of how large it is going to look on your wrist before purchasing it. The only thing that is a bit weird is that the numeral for 4 is incorrect (should be IV not IIII), but after a quick look at wikipedia apparently this is a common custom for clocks and watches. So if you notice that, it isn't because you got a knock-off. Overall this is a really nice watch. It feels great and looks great and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a simple leather banded watch."
1,Do not buy this product,"WARNING - DO NOT BUY VICTORINOX SWISS ARMY!!!Had this watch for 13 months, and was exactly what I wanted. However, it fogged up on month 13. Sent it to Victorinox for repair. The unit was purchased from an AUTHORIZED VICTORINOX SWISS ARMY seller. BUT because I bought it through their Amazon Store Front, Victorinox WILL NOT HONOR THEIR WARRANTY. They want around $250 for repairs. I cannot do business with a manufacturer who excludes their warranties on technicalities.Amazon is attempting to find some type of solution to the issue. Because it was bought from a 'store front', Amazon's 2 year warranty does not apply either. I am waiting to hear back from the seller, who told me in an e-mail that they were an authorized seller for Swiss Army. I may be stuck.WARNING - DO NOT BUY VICTORINOX SWISS ARMY!!!"
5,Awesome build quality at a good price.,"Great watch. Classic styling; goes with almost anything from t-shirt and jeans to a nice suit. Perfect size. Keeps accurate time. Great build quality; it just feels like a tank, but an elegant tank.Great value too. A quality Swiss automatic for less than many quartz watches."
2,Bait and switch,"The product looks blue in the picture - no one could deny that! That's what I ordered, and imagine my surprise when I opened the package and found it in flaming pink! I'm a big burly guy, and pink doesn'g go with me. I decided to keep it only because I didn't want the hassle of sending it back at my expense and waiting for a replacement. Functionally, it works well enough. The strap is a bit short, though.Caveat emptor.Eugene Spoconi"
5,Excellent sequel!!,"I have seen this movie for the first time today after I have bought it and I have to say that it wasn't as bad as everyone rated it. This movie is very thrilling and is much better than the first one because Arnold Vooslo plays as Darkman. The movie is filled with great special effects, great lines, and a twisting plot. I totally recommend this movie to any real fan of Darkman who wishes to see the story continued. Loved it! A must have!"
3,Somewhat Above Average Sequel,"Species 2, Return to Salem's Lot. Darkman 2 joins them as sequels who have been unfairly knocked. Larry Drake is astonishingly effective as bad guy Durant considering he is best known for playing a retarded man on LA Law. Enough action and plot twists to watch once a year or so."
3,Not bad but first darkman was better,This part is ok but I expected more action than that.So The first part is better I think.
4,"A sequel...er.. you might like it, you may not","The sequel to DARKMAN has a lot of the same thing re-happen. lots of comical scenes, etc. Its worth a look if you have seen the original. Judge for yourself how good it is, I'm a humble reviewer, don't take my word for it."
3,Close to nothing,"After Darkman, an inevitable sequel was to be made. Too bad it lost Liam Neeson and the grand action sequences that made the original such a spectacular movie.The only thing saving this one from being forgotten is its tragic hero element to it."
2,only appealing to darkman fanatics,This movie is strictly for fans who idolized the first Darkman. Arnold Vosloo does an OKAY job at filling the shoes of Darkman while the only real strong point is Larry Drake's return.Given two stars only because its better than the third.
2,worth a look,the second darkman movie is a disappointment but not as bad as the third.arnold vosloo tried too hard to fill the shoes of darkman.the films only strong point is larry drake who again plays villian robert g. durant.better than the third (only by a thread)
2,"Sadly,","The lack of Liam neeson and raimi's directing is what ruined this movie for me. While Mr. Vasloo is superb in his taking on the burden of the Liam created character and mr. Drake always has appeal, the movie as a whole needed a much better script. It was too predicatble, too phoney.On the bonus side, they did manage to keep the hapahazard and crazy comments Darkman makes during chases and fight scenes in tact, so that was a plus."
3,Return of Durant,"I bought this title because Arnold Vosloo was a leading member of the cast, and I've come to appreciate his characterizations. I'd not seen the original Darkman, so I had no preconceived notions of what the series was like, I therefore enjoyed it more than a connoisseur of the genera might have. I did seen Darkman III first, however, and enjoyed it more; perhaps because I enjoyed Jeff Fahey as a bad-guy more than I did Larry Drake. They do say that the quality of the villain makes the film. I also thought Mr. Vosloo's Darkman was more brittle in II than in III. Perhaps the quality of the bad guy effected his performance too, or maybe he was just getting used to his character and the series and was only beginning to develop his own particular point of view on both. I tend to agree with the reviewers who felt that the series would make a better subject for TV than for Cinema."
3,WARNING! DVD may be missing!!,"First for the warning...I bought this DVD over Christmas but didn't get around to watching it. Surprise! When I got around to opening the DVD it was missing in the sealed case. So make sure you check all your DVDs after you buy them. Especially some of these cheap Universal discs. Great deal when they include the DVD.So about the film itself? Well it's decent. It continues the cool Darkman character. It lacks the amazing acting of the first film but there are plenty of Darkman bits. Both 2 & 3 lean more for the cheese but are fun in their own way. Don't expect the original, but if you liked Robocop 2 or 3 then you'll love Darkman 2."
3,Just one reason,This movie was okay. Vosloo was alright. Larry Drake was fine. But what drew me to watch this sequel is Renee Connor in one of her pre-Xena appearances. Though her character needed to be written with more depth and background she did a wonderful job as Laurie Brinkman. What I can't understand is why Kim Delaney gets higher billing when her screen time is miniscule compared to Renee's and Kim's part could be deleted and not effect the film.
5,Another great movie!,This movie is a fun filled movie that delivers nonstop action and isn't one second boring! Brilliant!
2,Not as enthusiastic as others,"I can't say I've had as good an experience as others reported here...the main problem I've discovered is that the compressor only cycles on for about seven minutes at a time, followed by fifteen minutes during which the machine simply operates as a fan and blows in hot air from outside. Company info on their web site indicates that this is being done to prevent the compressor from overheating--unfortunately, this results in the compressor remaining cool while my small studio apartment (only 200 sq feet) remains too hot. I don't know if other units have similar limitations, but I would hesitate to recommend this product on the basis of my own experience. Hope this is helpful to anyone looking to make a buying decision..."
5,Works Well!,The price is right. The installation is simple. The room is cool! What more could I ask?
4,great product,It came right on time and it was a lifesaver. I don't have to put it in the window so I am happy. It works great and I have no complaints.
2,Assembly Not Intuitive - no assembly manual with unit!,"Well, there was not clear instructions. I have extra parts that the instruction sheet never refers to. I have an adjustable ""slide"" bar that that doesn't adjust or slide. I called the Amcor customer support, and it was clear that the representative knew nothing of the product. They stated it would be 2 business days for a reply. I would expect some manual, and product feedback form, etc. All I received was one sheet......So, if you are the type of person that gets frustrated trying to put together your childs bike and there are no instructions, you may want to pass on this purchase.I still have not turned the unit on."
2,You still need a window for this!!!!,"If you are buying this because you have no window to vent from, DON'T!!! You will still need a window and it doesn't make sense. There is a big giant size hose to vent out of a window. This thing is really not portable in my opinion. Sent it back."
4,hope to hear more compilations,I really enjoyed this first compilation by Victor Dinaire. He has made excellent transitions in moving the tracks in together melodically. Eclectic selections of tracks as well as diversity. I recommend this cd to anyone who enjoys trance. This is the by far the best in the series of Logic Trance. Hope to hear more from this new artist in the future.
5,Peaceful Music featured in Animal Kingdom Disney,"This album is full of soft peaceful music, that can help release stress and anxiety. Footprints has four songs off the album that are featured in Disney's Animal Kingdom Park, my favorite park, great musicians! I recommend this album to anyone who likes soft rock or even light jazz. Listening to this album brings me back on vacation! (In my mind of course) So check this album out, it is worth every penny!! Thank you for your time!"
3,Good reading for the tech and history buff,"The author takes the reader through a course of history dating from pre-WWII to the present on the evolution of not only radar development but also radio astronomy, transisters, digital computers and the radar maping of Earth, the Moon and Venus by radar. The writers style conforms to both the general reader and the technician. If you are interested in both history and electronics you will find this book enjoyable. It will also make excellant reference material to inventors names and dates for a great many electronic devices we take for granted today."
3,expected better,"The fresh scent as you open the box is fantastic, but after diluting as instructed to get full use, the fresh scent diminishes rapidly. I guess my expectations were too high."
1,Appears to be photocopied--NOT original printing!,I have two copies of this book--the one I ordered from Amazon for over $10 and one I ordered on ebay for $1. The one I ordered from the Amazon seller appears to be photocopied. The pictures are in black and white and the pages are cut short. The only color is on the cover. The book I ordered from ebay is obviously an original publication. Don't buy this book from the Amazon seller unless you want to get a cheap copy for a high price.
1,"Good idea, poor execution","While I agree with the ideas presented in this book, in particular the use of good manners, I feel the formatting and unattractive artwork ruin the story for both me and my children. My son (16 mo) had no idea what the story was about and was very confused about what the various animals were, while he can easily identify the same animals in photographs or other picture books. (Always thankful for Richard Scarry.) My 4 year old daughter could identify the animals and food and was able to repeat most of the story back to me, but obviously had difficulty with the formatting of the book - a question is asked on one page and the answer and next question appear on the next page. Along with the jumbled mix of imagery, this confused her and irritated me.To each their own... I'm sure there are plenty of fans out there who this book speaks to. For us, it feels like there are so many good quality children's books to read that this felt like a waste of time."
3,Cute but...,"This story is cute but I recommend getting The WIDE MOUTHED BULL FROG or THE LONG NOSED PIG which are more entertaining, in my opinion. My kids love those 2 and are so-so about the hippo story."
5,Big help for us,"The battery in our boat would go dead over a few weeks even though everything was shut off. There was obviously a leak somewhere, perhaps in the radio.We installed this switch which completely isolates the battery from the boat when not in use. It has solved our problem and the battery is always ready for use. We've now had the switch over three years and it still works fine. It took us a while to remember to switch the battery off after a day of boating but it is a habit now.The switch is of good quality."
5,Hauntingly Beautiful!,"Easily the best album to come out of LA's so-called ""Paisley Underground"" scene in the 1980's Kendra Smith's plaintiff vocals and David Roback's weeping guitar float along on a cloud and create a beautiful listening experience you'll never forget! This CD collects all of their early EPs on to one album, and every one is a gem.If you're holding out on purchasing this rare CD because of the price consider this, it will probably never be reissued! Founder David Roback abandoned the music industry in the 90's, and I have it from a reliable source that he has no intention of ever revisiting his musical past."
3,solid record,"A good record overall. A little bit commercial for my taste, but still good. Better than much of the rest of their catalog."
2,Very disappointing,"The impression from the description on the back of the book is of a fast paced search for answers; bomber threatening to strike again in ten days, obsessive search for clues. This book had none of that.My biggest problem with the book was the complete lack of a sense of time. They have ten days to figure out who the bomber is yet events that take place in the book are frequently those which would take much longer (ie: the owner of the airline selling his house to make payroll? in less than a week? and his having to move out immediately?). In fact, I thought that whole plot point was forgotten about until late in the book when it's noted the deadline was the next day...."
5,A Very Intriguing Mystery re: NTSB,No words are wasted. As up to date as internet gambling and today's headlines. It grips you from the first page and doesn't reveal the criminal until the very end. No regrets about this book.
2,"The story is acceptable, but the typography is excruciating.","Most reviews concentrate on the plot and character development. I believe this has been adequately covered by other reviewers. I want to point out that the typography in this tome is excruciating. There are no spaces after periods so that the whole thing reads like one run-on sentence. My wife gave up reading it after only a dozen pages. I finished the book, but I couldn't read it straight through the way I usually read a suspense novel, because I was fighting to find the ends of sentences all the way. I find it hard to believe that a reputable publisher would inflict this on readers."
2,Excruciating,"One star for the book and one star for me having the ability to finish. The book looked like a great premise that fell way short. Every possible cause for the crash is painstakingly drawn out to dead ends. As filler, there seems to be pages on end about harmonicas and landscape descriptions, yawn. There is never an indication in the development of the story about how it comes to its strange conclusion. Maybe an entire book about one of the characters, Linda Dillon is something I might read.I got this book at Salvation Army. Not sure whether to put it in the paper recycle bin or donate back to Salvation Army."
2,2D Characters in a 3D World,"Terminal Event was a great technology read and provided an enormous amount of insight into the working of the National Transportation Safety Board crash investigations. From the forensic investigations of the shattered bodies to the analysis of the National Security Agency data files, the technology was spot on. Now, about the story - good grief but all the characters were two dimensional and horribly predictable. The ""bomber"", although not readily identified, was know as none of the suspects. The suspects - Saudi intelligence and Idaho ""Off the Net"" resisters - were sadly paper cutouts. Half way through the story the FBI's frustration with the non-suspects drove me - the reader - into fits of frustration. I almost put the book away but wanted to know ""who done it!""I found this book in a remaindered book strip mall book outlet. There was a good reason that it was there."
1,Not what I expected.,"This is a book mostly on elementary anatomy. If you are looking for exciting and suspenseful stories, buy another book. There are a lot of fabricated scenarios and theories from past events rather than actual live experiences as indicated on the book jacket. This book was written in National Geographic style. The majority of the book describes the environment of each situation. I purchased the book to read about the real life threatening situations, not to read about the landscape or anatomy."
1,12 minutes,"Content was interesting, too bad it only lasted 12 minutes. Huge dissapointment! Dont waste your time, sure you could find the clip on youtube or something."
4,o-o-o child remake,love the original but who remade o-o-o child after these guys...it's making me crazy...thanks
2,Fourth-rate history,"Really, this is the worst sort of hatchet job by a man obsessed with Chiang Kai-shek and the evil he is thought to have done. Seagrave has written some truly awful stuff, generally based on one twisted bit of history, and generally made toxic by his loathing for CKS, the Soong family, Claire Chennault, and indeed anyone and anything associated with Nationalist China.For a more recent, scholarly, and honest portrayal of CKS and those who surrounded him, see the excellentThe Generalissimo: Chiang Kai-shek and the Struggle for Modern China (Belknap Press), a recent biography by Jay Taylor, published by a division of Harvard University Press.As for this book, I give it two stars instead of the one it probably deserves, because as other reviewers have pointed out, it is an entertaining read. The same of course can be said by anything from Nora Roberts."
2,It died after 2 weeks,"I loved the look of this mouse, hoping I had found another corded version of something the similar shape and size of the Logitech MX510. WRONG! It is a lot smaller, and very flimsy. It died about 2 weeks into using it."
5,SUPER Mouse!,"I bought this a while back and am sorry I didn't type up a review at the time because it is such a good mouse that I want you to know about it. It fits nicely in my hand, has a wheel as well as forward and back buttons. And it's pretty cheap for all you get with it. Wireless mice are never very good as far as I'm concerned. This is the best wired mouse I've found. I LOVE IT. You will too."
5,SONG KEPT RUNNING THROUGH MY MIND-GREAT EXPERIENCE,"I LOVE THIS SONG, AND AM VERY GLAD TO SUBMIT COMMENTS REGARDING IT'S ORIGINALITY, KILLER BEAT, AND MEMORABLE LYRICS AND RHYTHM."
1,Powershot A520 On Switch,The Powershot A520 On Switch stopped working right after I started using the camera.
3,"Decent camera, but there are better ones for the price range","Nothing exciting about this camera. Got this as a Christmas gift. Not a bad one though. My brother has a Panasonic Lumix DMC-LZ2 and I've used it a few times. If I were to pay for a camera, I would've bought the LZ2. A recent Business Week article mentioned LZ1 & LZ2 as the best selling cameras in Japan immediately after introduction. Lumix LZ2 must be good....So far, I don't have any complaints about A520; it's just an average camera."
2,Negative,"For average people who want a camera that just works-and takes good pics you should not buy this. I don't know about the specifics, but like other reviewers mine got stuck and quit working for no reason after a couple of months. So, I don't really see what all the bells and whistles are for if it doesn't even take a picture. It was fine while it worked, it ate batteries but the pics were good."
3,Fragile piece of equipment,This product can be very fragile. I dropped it from about 1 foot and now it doesn't respond when I try to turn it on.
1,Worthless,I bought this camera on the recommendation of a store technician over another HP digital. The camera has spent as much time in the repair shop as it has being used. The delay between pictures is incredibly long. The lens/shutter doesn't open properly. (Two other family members who own Powershot A520's are having the same problems.
2,"works well under daylight, otherwise poor performance","This is one of those cameras you won't be excited when you move from 35mm film cameras into digital world. Noise is horrible. I mean I can see noise even at lowest 50 ISO setting while using flash. I am silent about other higher setting. Yellowish tint. I think that Canon photo department is suffering from yellowish tint with its cameras, printers (I have pixma ip 4200) and all photo equipment. It seems that most of the pictures this camera produce have yellowish tint, with kind of warming yellow filter effect. And it does all the time. Highlights that are supposed to be white are slightly yellow. Most people won't notice this, but if you are photographer you'll see it right away. Auto focus poor too. In all, maybe good camera for 4 by 6 prints in a broad daylight. Otherwise stay away from this underperforming camera."
1,Big Disappointment,"I bought this camera as a gift. Actually this is the 2nd A520 I've bought in 3 weeks. Both of these A520s were defective - the lens cover would not open all the way on either of them, so I of course returned the original and the replacement. In general, I like Canon cameras. You get a lot of camera for the money compared to some other cameras. For this reason, I ordered a Canon A610 and so far it has worked beautifully. My husband and I both have Canons and have never had problems. After my experience, however, I would not recommend the A520. I've seen good reviews of it in several magazines, but for myself, I will not go for a third try!"
2,Good design yet poor production quality,This is my fourth digital camera. I am happy with the right amount of features packed in a small package. The quality of the pictures turned out to be reasonable for this type of camera.The real disappointment was the quality of assembly. There are five white flakes visible by bare eyes between the clear protection cover and the LCD screen. The largest one was more then 0.5mm. It is annoying to look at the pixels blocked by these flakes when taking pictures.<added 2/22>I took apart the back cover of the camera and cleaned up the annoying flakes on the display.I've taken 500 pictures with this camera in 10 days.+ the 4x zoom gives a wider angle to take group photos in a smaller room+ the high sensitivity allowed me to take most of the indoor pictures without the need for flash+ the use of AA battery makes it easy to carry spares- the zoom control moves too fast- the rubber strip that covers the connectors does not snap in place securely
4,"Very nice camera, Good Clear Photos",We bought this because it was on sale with the purchase of a printer. I am amazed at the clear photos. Almost never come out fuzzy. Also the photos have very good coloring even in auto. Very good camera for taking landscapes picts. And uploading to the computer is a snap.But not wonderful at taking close ups.The worst flaw would have to be the pause you get when you take a picture. Even though its just a few seconds you may miss the target. But every thing else is great! I think its Good Buy
1,Same issues,I have the same issues as everyone else with this camera and unfortunately I am out of the warranty window.
3,Sticking lens cover.,"It is nice to have a digital camera after using the Cannon AE-1 for 20 years. However, since I bought it the lense shield always sticks partway closed. I have to flick it with my finger until it is open all the way. This is a real pain especially when I want to get a quick picture.Also night pictures have large spots all over, not noticed when taking normal pictures."
1,reoccuring shutter problems!,"I received a Canon Powershot a520 last Christmas in 2005 It had to be sent in six months later because the shutter kept sticking and camera wouldn't take pictures. Came back repaired under warranty and again had to send back at Christmas this year for THE VERY SAME PROBLEM!Canon wouldn't honor warranty as it was a few days out of warranty. When I said it was for the same problem again, they wouldn't budge and the fee was 98 dollars to fix. They offered me a choice of buying a refurbished one for 99 dollars so I bought that so i could get at least a six month warranty. I feel this camera should be recalled and that this is a racket. They need to improve the quality of this camera and stop ripping off people. Buy another brand!!!"
3,Good and Bad,"I have been a 35mm film person for the past 30 years. I bought this camera in Oct '05 as I have family members in Iraq and Kuwait this year and wanted to be able to email them pictures asap. I found picture color to be accurate and the flash coverage good, even for a recent church wedding. The size is nice -- big enough to have a firm, safe grip on the camera yet small enough to want to take everywhere. But....most pictures have red eye, even when red eye reduction is on. The sharpness of the pictures is so-so. They just don't seem to have the absolutely sharp, in-focus look to them that I am used to with my film pictures. I have not had the lens sticking problem I have read about in other reviews but, due to picture quality, I only use this camera for those need-to-send-now pictures. If you want an inexpensive camera/are new to photography this is an ok camera. If sharp pictures and minimal red eye are important to you keep looking elsewhere."
3,Slow...very slow...,"I have S400 so I did not beleive when many people mentioned here that A520 is slow.. But I regret it today. It is very slow between clicks.. I tried a very fast SD card.. no use, still it is slow.. On average it takes 5-6 sec between clicks. sometimes much more.."
4,A well-behaved little camera,"This is my first digital camera, purchased for a recent trip to Europe. First off, the batteries that come with the camera will last just long enough for you to play with the little memory card, maybe two hours. You will need a bigger card, and lithium AA batteries will last much, much longer. In fact, I didn't need my back-up set of batteries during my week in Prague (and no need for an adapter and converter for rechargables, either). Perhaps I'm spoiled by my old 35mm camera, but I found the slow shutter speed annoying, especially at night with the flash. The camera would click just in time to catch some random person walking in front of me. Good thing I can preview and delete the bad photos. Once I got the hang of it, the A520 did very well (and the prints impressed my co-workers) and I look forward to learning how to best use the extra features."
3,Disappointed,"Loved my Canon Powershot A10 -- an oldie but goodie. Still takes absolutely great photos even tho the hinge on the battery compartment is broken, and I'm using tape to hold it shut.Bought the 520 with high expectations. What I got was disappointment.1- I have thrown out many photos. Many blurry, even with flash, even with subjects sitting still.2- Noisy chime when you turn on the power -- very disconcerting when in a quiet setting.3- Long delay on flash shots -- subjects must remain still for several seconds before photo is actually taken.4- Recycle time is excruciatingly long between flash shots.Overall -- very very disappointed in this camera.C."
3,Too Soon To Really Tell,"I have own this camera for 5 hours now.Biggest problem default picture size is 1024 x 768 with the 16 Mg card supplied that means 14 Pic's.; of course first 2-3 are wasted working the controls.Default should be 800 x 600 and the base card supplied should be at least 32 mg.Yes, I know read the manual, come on, I wanted to take pictures. That is why I bought it.The reviews had been good, and I figured I would be happy.Well I was able to get a few pictures and they turned out much better then I expected. I only wish that while in the moment of a new camera I could have experienced more then 10 pictures before it told me ""NO MORE"".Ok, Coulda, Woulda, Shoulda, but damn. I got the camera 20 miles from home and could not offload the pics.Even a film camera gives you 24 - 36 shots out of the gate.PS: Picture Capture is very slow, I had heard that but decided to see for myself - Do Not Make this Mistake; get faster SD cards right from the get go."
3,ok,this camera is a little big for the price and some pictures I took came out very bad quality. I tried to take a small passport photo and was unable to make a good one. I returned it for a camera with more than 3mps
2,I HATE this camera,I have never had a camera that I hated as much as this one. Very slow to start up. Your subject can literaly walk away. Very tough to focus if the autofocus chooses to be finiky.
3,Good Camera,"Good quality pictures, the only problem is that sometimes the lens cover opens halfway when you power up the camera."
4,could be better,the cover over the lense broke/small lcd screen/ pictures are pritty good/battery life is pritty good/some images can come out a bit blurry if theres no flash and your hands arnt that steady/takes nice portaits/ easy to use/ has a veiw-finder.
3,"A lot of Good Points, however one deal breaker for me.","I like a lot of things about this digital camera:*Cute, small, easy to hold and comfortable to operate.*Simple controls, easy to use and understand.*Very clear LCD display.*Takes nice crisp pictures and the flash works well.*Great sound quality on the movie mode.The reason we are not going to keep this digital camera is that the shutter speed is a joke. I like to take funny pictures of things to share with people, like when my cat is trying to teach my dog manners... well by the time the camera powers on, and the shutter decides to snap a picture, the action is over, the sun has gone down, and the moment is over. This is not the camera to use if you want to capture sponaneous moments, it is fine if you want to take a picture of a flower, a work of art, or a posed photo- but be warned, the shutter takes its time to click and that time is too long for me."
1,Very disappointing,"If you ever need to take indoor shots in succession, DO NOT buy this camera. I loved my last Canon and went with this one which was newer, but in the same series. The recharge time for the flash is terrible between 7 & 15 seconds and really makes a difference when you're trying to capture the perfect shot. The reason seems to be that this model only uses 2 batteries. The A620 is entirely worth the extra $100 since it has 4 batteries and the fold out screen."
4,Great Cam,"Let me say that this cam is exceptionally well for its size. The best modes are the portrait and the landscape mode. this cam provides a very good grip which makes taking pictures very stable. The shooting modes are fairly easy to grapse. This camera is fairly light compared with the SD series. As with all powershots, the lens can be removed and additional lens can be added to shoot pictures with even better quality. This makes the A520 a must have for amateurs to regular photo makers.However there are a bit of technical difficulties. The ""Pets"" mode doesn't do a good job on the pets. This cam requires good lighting from the cam/surrounding to make pictures crisp and sharp.See sample pics from yahoo search. The pictures here devalue the cam's abilities.Good luck"
2,It had potential....,"This book was interesting, not entirely a bad read, but unfortunately, it does not even approach its potential. Rather than getting a pleasant account of Mr Masson's transition to New Zealand and a description of why he so loves his adopted land, we are given a hardcover copy of the man's political manifesto - everything from race relations to spanking to materialism - with some tidbits of New Zealand life laced between. Really, I could be spared. And, indeed - it is most ironic that while Masson repeatedly praises the Kiwis' egalitarianism, he himself comes off as something of an arrogant, self-righteous name-dropper."
2,New Zealand must be better than this.,"I'm in full agreement with Victoria Dew, who's review precedes my own. I was intrigued by the premise of the book but my interest quickly turned to disappointment. Although there are some interesting facts about New Zealand, they are overshadowed by Mr. Masson's thinly veiled sense of self import. Ironic, given the often-sited intolerance New Zealander's have for the tallest poppies (braggarts), of which Mr. Masson is a prime example, and given Mr. Masson's apparent admiration for native son Sir Edmund Hillary who stands in stark contrast as a model of humility.Contrary to Mr. Masson's supposition that his book would result in a sudden influx of immigrants to New Zealand, I found my interest in the islands diminished by Mr. Masson's work. What a bore!"
1,pretty lame,"We've visited New Zealand and consider moving there from time to time, like when Dubya gets re-elected! :-) So I bought this book looking for a real review of New Zealand, its strengths and weaknesses. Instead I got is this sappy, sugar coated, drivel about how NZ is just oh, so perfect, and where it's not, the problem is analyzed through rose colored glasses. In actuality, if you can get past the thick coating of sugar, there is some meat - some facts and history in this book. I became too nauseated to go much past half way through. I've never taken the time to write a review on Amazon, but this book is just so lame I'd like to have others spend their money on something more worthwhile, like a travel guide to NZ. You'd get better information that way!"
2,Why I'm glad you live in New Zealand,If you like self-aggrandizing and politically correct college professors who think white men are responsible for everything wrong in the world and has met Bill Clinton - then you will love this book
4,"Not ""Peter Mayle""","Not that Peter Mayle is a bad thing occasionally, but if you are looking for the typical travel genre such as A Year In Provence, C'Est La Vie, The Sex Lives of Cannibals, etc, this book is not for you. I found his political and environmental slant on things very interesting. I plan on looking him up when I move to New Zealand......"
1,I don't care why you moved to NZ,"I found this to be a strange book, poorly edited, and without much of a focus - except, of course, the author's focus on himself. As others have pointed out, many ""facts"" are not verified or true. The author's privilege blurs his vision of a land that is beautiful, but very complex. It was almost as if he had a deal with NZ immigration - that if he wrote a book about NZ, he could immigrate there...and the book was pandering to that. The final ""travel guide"" pages were bizarre - if I had wanted to buy a travel guide, I would have."
1,A horrid let-down,"I was greatly excited to see that the library was getting this book as I have had trouble finding New Zealand travel books in their section. I felt that the author wasn't so much as impressed and in love with New Zealand as he was with himself. You are lucky to enough to be able to read about why the various other countries he has lived in aren't up to snuff, and his long litany of various types of studies he has undertaken and his quite impressive library, and the complete lack of NZ intellectuals. He never really mentions the day to day life and interactions with Kiwis. He basically only writes about those like Sir Edmund Hillay or the foriegn prime minister or some equally important person. And all thru this he mentions his political viewpoints and I never felt like I could picture New Zealand from his writing. It was a tedious read to say the least."
2,Lefty Looking for Utopia,"The book is mostly a left-wing rant against the world. He has only lived there for three years...I wonder how long before he finds injustice or dissapointment with this place, like every other place he has lived, and that list is long. I'm giving it two stars only for the nice descriptions he has of nature. The last sentence in the book alludes to the fact that he may return to America if the Democrats return to power; it was written in 2004. I guess he could have returned a couple of years ago."
2,buy it used,"The book is ok. Moderately helpful in parts. However, the author spends huge amounts of space describing trees and plants in tremendous detail. That is not why I bought the book. I wish he would have included a chapter on local politics, demographics, and the differences between the cities. There would have been plenty of space to do so if he had not included page after page of boring tree discussion!"
1,"Awful, Waste of Time","As a young American interested in New Zealand, I ended up feeling sorry for the Kiwis that this guy emigrated there. He comes off as a pretentious, sniveling liberal, and his warped political ideology permeates throughout the entire book. It was creepy for me to read about his young wife, annoying to sit through his constant name-dropping (as if anyone cares who you went to Harvard with, dude) and almost unbearable to trudge through his sick liberal fawning. Here's an evolutionist torn over whether or not trees have feelings. That sadness you get because a forest was cleared? That's because you are a created being with a connection to nature. At age 63, this guy has learned nothing. And his writing is so boring. I almost wanted to visit New Zealand less knowing he is there. Sigh."
5,DELTA'S UNIFENCE,"THE UNIFENCE IS A GREAT ACCESSORY FOR ANY TABLE SAW. MINE CAME ON MY GRAND EDITION SAW, AND UNTIL I HAD IT I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT I WAS MISSING. IT LOCKS DEAD SOLID, IS VERY EASY TO ADJUST, AND STAYS SQUARE. THE WAY THE FENCE SLIDES BACK AND FORTH MAKES CUTOFFS SAFE AND EASY. THE UNIFENCE WILL MOUNT TO JUST ABOUT ANY TABLE SAW--A GOOD FENCE IS THE BEST THING YOU CAN ADD."
5,"30"" Unifence","I have a Grizzly 10"" Cabinet Saw that I have been upgrading. To date this is the best upgrade that I have made. It bolted right on to the saw, I didn't have to drill a hole,adjustment only took minutes and it performs flawlessly. One note though you will need an table extention so either buy Delta's or plan on making your own...the instructions are in the assembly manual."
4,HASSLE FREE,I have this fence on my platinum edition saw and I'm very happy with it.I've tried other fence systems including biesemeyer and this one beats them all.Once assembled and adjusted it's soo smooth as it glides along the table and it clamps down rock solid.Unless your shop floor is 100% level(mine isnt either)you will need to make some kind of adjustment to either your saw stand or extension table.Delta does offer a real nice laminated table to fit your saw or you could make your own real easy. the legset you put under your extension table should have adjustable feet it's a whole lot easier to plumb it all up.The design of this fence allows it to be adjusted up or down front or rear independently of the carriage.I do recommend this fence for new saws or anyone looking to give an old saw new life. This ones a winner..
2,victorious boxers 2,An odd boxing game easy is too easy and medium is a little hard or I just didn't play it enough.
3,Think cheap hospital band,"The glue gets caught in kitten fur, making these difficult to put on. They are inexpensive though, and can be redone easily."
2,Out of Date,"This book is horribly out of date, vague and poorly edited. I found a few pieces of information helpful but not much. I will certainly look for a more current book this time around. Many of the examples refer to California and are, therefore, very misleading. You'd be better off with internet research."
4,"Had a moderate radio sucess hit with ""look what we made""","If Jonathan Edwards were better at promoting his records with the radio stations, this album would have had at least 1 or 2 top one hundred country songs on it. Talented song writers like Dave Loggins and and David Goodman have lent their works to this album. Definite must for JE fans!"
3,Does not work with Dell,"I tried this on both a Dell Inspiron notebook as well as a Dell Inspiron 530 desktop. On both computers the mouse would work but the keyboard did not.I ended up with the Kingwin UPS2C(I could not locate it on Amazon, had to go elsewhere) and it worked fine. That was is only $4.99 and works perfectly even with a KVM."
2,Drivers cause blue screen on Windows 7 64-bit,I bought this converter to connect my laptop that runs Windows 7 64-bit with my Lynxmotion SSC-32 controller board. The driver that shipped with the device is unfortunately faulty and causes BSODs (Blue Screen Of Death). I debugged the memory dumps and was able to pinpoint the cause. It is definitively the converter driver.I recommend not to use it for Windows 7 until a decent driver becomes available.
4,Good cable for old printer new computer,I have an HP Laserjet 5p and I bought a new Toshiba laptop. The printer still works great so I wanted to be able to use it. This cable works well connecting the two. You just have to tell the computer which USB port you are using and you should be good to go.
5,easy and useful,"Gave this to my father, who is not very techno. He seems to have got it working with no trouble."
5,TRENDnet USB cable is a must,"This cable is a must if you have a Laptop that doesn't have a parallel port. Nothing to install, just plug n play!"
4,Good,"This product does the job well which is more what I can ask for. The only thing I was hoping (which isn't really a deal breaker) was that Windows 7 does not automatically detect my printer until I install the drivers for it. Not that big of a deal, but still needed one step vice complete plug and play."
4,Works as expected,"I am very satisfied with the USB->Serial cable adapter. My only minor complaint is that the screw sockets on the serial end of the cable are not removable. I even opened the adapter case to see if I could remove them but they are riveted on. Because they aren't removable, I have to remove the screw sockets from every cable or device that I want to connect to the serial end. All in all, the cable works great and is instantly recognized as a COM: port by my Windows 7 laptop."
3,OSX 10.7 UNSUPPORTED,"Based on the fantastic reviews posted here, I bought this. I installed the included driver, but I am unable to get this to work.I looked into it, and it doesn't work under OSX 10.7 when running in 64 bit kernel mode (The default for all recently macs). Thus, this will not work for newer macs.Specifically, the Kernel Module provided by TrendNet supports the following:Mach-O object i386Mach-O object ppcIt lacks the following architecture, which makes this not usable:Mach-O 64-bit kext bundle x86_64"
4,Works great....reliable,"I work with telecommunications equipment that often is accessed through direct serial connection or through a modem. I got a new laptop with no serial ports and I was worried about connectivity to these devices. Many co-workers told me horror stories of trying to get usb-to-serial converters that work. I plugged this one in, loaded the CD and have had no problems since. One thing I did find, is that I have to plug it into the same USB port in order to maintain a consistant Comm port assignment. Works great with external modem as well as direct connect."
5,Wow! A Winner in your corner!,"This is a well made product and should last for many years of use. I can see many uses for this item, but I specifically bought this product with one use in mind. This product works fantastically for using Amiga Explorer by Cloanto and direct connecting my HP Laptop through it's USB ports to the serial port on my Amiga 1000. This makes transferring files between windows and the Amiga operating system a snap! I can even take electronic .ADF files and drag and drop files to burn directly to the floppy drive on the Amiga 1000. I would image that almost any application where you need to add a serial port to your PC will be able to use this device."
4,TU-S9,USB to RS-232 converter workes good. It just will not work on W7. I have it running on a XP computer and it is working fine. CD installed driver as advertised.
1,May not be compatible with KVM switches,"Bought this to use with the 4-port PS/2 KVM switch, for a newly purchased computer tower. It is not acceptable, for the reason it does not transmit keypresses while any other key is being held down. I type 60-80 wpm - so about half my key strokes are dropped unless I type v-e-r-y s-l-o-w-l-y. Had to destroy the packaging to get the product out, so I'm junking it. Also bought an Adesso - it works perfectly."
2,keyboard not working,trendnet tu-ps2. mouse works but keyboard keeps repeating 1st key pressed. using linksys kvm switch with ps2 connectors. converter is not useable.
3,Too Many Hiccups,".* Amazon reviews here cover 3 different products. This review is for the TU-PS2 USB to PS/2 Converter.I originally rated this 5-stars, but now I notice little glitches several times a day. Once in a while it acts like a key is being held down, even though it has been released. Other times a keystroke does not register.Using a Dell Studio XPS 8100 desktop machine (Windows 7 -64bit), with a circa 2001 Dell keyboard. It has no trouble with simultaneous keystrokes (ctrl-alt-delete, etc.).PROs:- Plug & play- Branded product - no confusion of reviews for other products- 2 year warranty from a well established company.- Fit and finish is very good. Looks and feels like quality.CONs:- Occasional goof-ups- - - Pricing - - -Low tide is around 9.50, with rare dips to 7.00 or 8.00. There's an ""Online Price Alert"" that will email you whenever this or any amazon product dips below your target price. Google it. It's nicely done. Or try camelcamelcamel.~~~ Comments & questions welcome ~~~"
3,Difficult,Product arrived in good shape and on time. I did the CD installation then hooked up the new connection to a GPS. It did not allow a download to the E TREX legend. I did the download again (Windows XP) and it worked this time. Challenging.
5,Works great!,Works great for our printer! No more old cable and could get rid of the old PC without worrying about not being a compatible port! No problems with Lexmark E321 and a Windows 7 cd!
3,This USB converter cable looks like it's well made.,"I did not get it to work with what I bought it for. I do not think it is the USB cable device, though."
4,Replaced my broken serial connection with USB!,"My laptop gets used to configure switches, routers and other network equipment using a serial port connection. After one particularly long session of configurations, my serial connection failed. I discovered that one pin in the port on the laptop was broken... of course it was one of the important pins, so I could no longer communicate with the equipment I was trying to configure or troubleshoot.I was reluctant to replace the motherboard because everything else worked so well. So I bought the TRENDNET USB-Serial converter. Perfect solution! Installation was simple. The only issue I have is that I have to change the COM setting on this device nearly every time because my old telnet software doesn't want to talk to anything above COM3. But that's a minor issue."
5,TRENDnet USB to PS/2 Converter,Worked great...plugged it in and my old keyboard worked on my new computer. I'm a happy camper.
2,Blue Screen of Death error caused by ser2pl64.sys,This device gave me a BSOD (blue screen of death). When I ran whocrashed to read the dump file the error was MULTIPLE_IRP_COMPLETE_REQUESTS file path: C:\windows\system32\drivers\ser2pl64.sys product: Prolific USB-to-Serial Bridge Cable. So I uninstalled and reinstalled the drivers and now it seems stable enough. I did need to unplug the usb port and re-seat the cable once when my console froze and plug it back in to restore console connectivity.Bottom line is I was able to get it to work atleast once but I don't know if I can trust this device to work consistently.
5,Super USB to Serial Device,"I needed a USB to serial cable to configure a RFID readers network parameters. I have been using an old XP desktop to do this.I tried a IOGear USB to Serial and found it to be very unreliable and buggy. After reading reviews here, I got the Trendnet TU-S9 prepared to use it on my older XP laptop. At the recommendation of another reviewer, I first and used those drivers. The adapter worked great on my old XP laptop. Then I tried it on a Dell Inspiron 64 bit Windows 7 laptop. It worked! I am very pleased with this product. Make sure you download the latest drivers from the website. The drivers on the CD are old."
4,Very Satisfied,I'm very pleased with this product. The only issue of concern I have is the drivers did not come with the CD that was provided. But I was able to download the drivers from the NET and the product works just fine.Thank youRobert
2,Unreliable for certain key combinations,"I ran into trouble when using the left shift and left windows keys simultaneously. For example, I remapped the keys for use on my Mac and then used shift-windows-arrowkey during text editing. Those two modifiers, when used in concert, register only about half the time; the rest of the time, only the arrow key is sent. I'm sure it's the adapter, since it happens on my Dell AT101W and the keyboard from an old HP Pavilion. The latter keyboard doesn't have this problem when using a simpler passthrough USB/PS2 adapter. (I don't have another adapter or a PS2 computer to test the former.)"
5,Worked great for my Russound MCA-C3,"Turns out that the whole house audio system I bought requires a serial port to make certain firmware updates. Bought this $10 converter and it worked like a charm.It didn't require any special configuration on my system. Just plugged it in and hooked it up to the stereo.The cable is pretty short, so if you have more than a short distance to go, you're going to need an extension.Definitely worth it. Now if only I can make sure that I don't lose it."
2,Did not work for my application,"Installation of the driver was easy, however this converter did not work for my application and my computer is unable to recognize the device I am connecting to this coverter."
4,Perfect except for one little thing...,"What I liked:- Long cable (21 inches without the connectors)- It just works (tested with Cisco PIX/ASA/Switch/Router)What I didn't like:- Feels a little flimsy.- You MUST install the driver before you can use it.Honestly that last point is the only reason why I'm not giving this product five stars.If you want to use this converter on just one computer you should be ok... But if like me you want to be able to move this around to connect to multiple devices then having to run around with a driver is not very nice.Other than that, once the driver is installed, it works perfectly with all the Cisco devices I threw at it."
3,it works!,I was a little bit dubious of the PS2 to USB conversion. Works perfectly and allows me to use my old ergonomic keyboard. My coworker noted how he liked that my keyboard looked like it was from 1990. Nothing like an old school keyboard!
3,Just OK,Worked for my one device but not on another that I needed it for. May work for some people; the price it right!
5,Worth It,"Worth the money. I wanted to use my older ps2 keyboard with my new Toshiba laptop, works great!!!! Worth it."
5,Worked without problem,"I've researched other usb to serial adapters having issues, this one was the best rated for compatibility in my opinion. Installed and worked without error on a Windows 7 32-bit pc to a console port on an OpenVMS system. Very happy."
4,Solid,Purchased this product with a null modem to connect to RS-232 devices. I had no problem with installation on a Windows 7 32 bit OS. Connection via A-B RSlinx and RSLogix 5000 running in XP mode worked perfectly.
3,Didn't Get to Use It,The crappy software with Voltmeter that I bought will not run on Windows 7 and the company no longer supports the software because that meter has long been out of production.
3,Great product,Was a great addition to my computer. Since the old printer didn't have a usb port dhis helped me and ease my jobs.
1,not recommended for Windows 7 applications,"This may be more of a driver than a hardware issue. I can't recommend this device for 64-bit Windows-7 applications. It's the first device that I've seen cause a blue screen in an otherwise solid Windows-7 machine.This device was also quite awkward in an otherwise straightforward Labview-based serial interface setup. (Was using Putty for testing at the time of the blue screen)Looking forward to trying something else... Until then, will revert to a Keyspan USA-19QW attached to an old WinXP box for testing...Cheers!"
1,"Works well sometimes, but intermittent errors on tranfer render useless",It worked well for 2-3 weeks. Then I started getting tranfer errors. I debugged high and low before changing my usb-serial (trendnet) adapter. Voila! everything works. So I got what I paid for. wasted my money on this.
2,Not working with Windows 7,I couldn't get it working with Windows 7. I guess since this cable uses the a Prolific chip its not a good solution for Win 7 and Vista. The drivers however loads fine and easy to install.I found an adapter at [...] with another type of processor chip which works perfectly with Windows 7.
2,Mediocre,"We had to install the drivers on XP and Windows 7, which is a major drawback. Also, once we had it listed in device manager we had to throttle back the send and receive settings to work with the brand of firewall for which we purchased this device."
2,Limited device support,Does not fit my needs. Does not support devices that use serial ports like mice or other non simple devices.
5,Works flawlesly,Works exactly as advertised. I use it for my laptop and can plug it in without rebooting. I've never had any connection problems whatsoever.
1,death after a month - used once,"I used it for one day and it worked fine and couldn't use it again. The laptop pops up with message "" USB device errors"". The adapter is very Hot when plugged in. I can't return it since it's over a month now, oh well"
1,Didn't work for me!,I wanted to connect my favorite DELL PS/2 keyboard tomy newer DELL PC that only has USB connections. Ithought this TRENDnet USB to PS/2 Converter wouldsolve the problem so I bought one and installed it perinstructions but I could not get the DELL keyboard totalk to my DELL PC. In fact my PC did not evenrecognize that the TRENDnet Converter was plugged into a USB port. I tried this with 2 different DELLPS/2 keyboards and tried several different USB portsbut no luck. I was not able to get the converter towork with my hardware.
4,Good multi OS USB 1.1 -> rs232 serial adapter,"This Adapter works well with Linux, OS X, Windows (but not Vista ), and BSD OSs or any system with Prolific USB-serial drivers .The only bad thing about this product is that is USB 1.1 thus if you use it with a USB 2.0 hub you will slow all the other devices on that HUB down to 1.1 speeds."
5,USB to Serial good to go,I opened the package and easily installed the usb to serial cable onto my computer and it is still working. no bugs or viruses or anything bad happening. So... Good to go.
3,"Erratic performance, maybe not converter's fault","I use it to connect a great older printer with a serial port to a computer with a USB port. I moved the printer from an older Windows XP computer that also had a serial port (the printer worked fine) to a newer Windows XP computer that only had USB ports (the printer now works about 2/3 of the time). It's possible that there is an internal software or hardware issue with the newer computer that is causing the problem, so I can't necessarily blame this converter. It's worth a try. Return it if it doesn't solve the problem."
1,Trouble with Keyboard,"Installs fine and the mouse works good but as soon as you type something on the keyboard, it keeps repeating the key stroke.I tried it on another computer and same results. I have a similar device from another manufacturer and that one works great.Maybe this one is a faulty piece but for the price, I might just throw it away and eat the loss. More hassle to return it."
5,It does what it says!,"It works just fine! I installed the Driver Software that came with it, set the baud rate, and there ya go!"
4,Works with Windows 7 x64,"This USB to 9-pin serial adapter is designed to allow you to use legacy serial equipment with a newer PC or laptop that does not have a serial port.It does that with no issues. Windows 7 64-bit will not recognize it out-of-the-box, but Windows will either suggest downloading the OEM chipset drivers (it finds the link on its own provided you're connected to the internet), or you can use the supplied installation disk. Either way will work fine.I've knocked off one star because the cord that connects the USB jack to the serial jack looks fragile and is not properly reinforced as it enters the jacks. The good news at $12 its fairly cheap."
5,"Sez what it duz, duz what it sez.",The converter works great! adds a new level of convienience to my laptop with out replacing my good ol' keyboard & trackball.
2,Garbage. Blues screen twice a day,"Garbage. Blues screen twice a day.I using it with Win7 64bit latest driver from their website + putty.If you have lots of text output in the serial console, better pray well, otherwise you'll get blue screen."
1,Does not work,"Bought this because my laptop only has USB ports and no PS/2 ports and I wanted to use a Model M keyboard. It just does not work. Tried with multiple computers and keyboards. Also when plugged in, it shuts off all other USB ports like they are shorted out or something."
3,NOT for Macs and Snow Leopard!,"Another review here convinced me to try this to connect my iMac with Snow Leopard to an old LaserJet 4200, even though the product itself says for Windows only. I'm glad it worked for the other Mac guy, but it doesn't work for me. I can't fault the product really; I just wanted to warn other Mac users away from it."
3,Unremovable screws,"DB9 ends don't seem to be entirely standardized on whether male or female will have the screws or the bolts on the side. Because of this, on most adapters, the bolts are removable so you don't have a really weird M/F plug interface with F/F attachments issue -- two with bolts rather than screws messes things up.These bolts aren't removable, so it may make your configuration impossible as it did with me. After some mangling, though, it's great."
5,Gotta have it,"Great Product, I work on equipment that requires 9 pin serial port connections and most new computers do not have the serial ports any more, this is a must to have in your computer bag!!Priced right and combined with another order I received FREE Shipping. Thanks"
2,Does not work with KVM,"I would give this 5 stars if you are only looking to use your Ps2 devices into ONE USB computer. The problem is that this does not work well on a KVM. It works when one computer is completely shut down, but not when both are running (which defeats the purpose of using a KVM!). The computers I used were a Dell Inspiron Desktop and a Toshiba Laptop, both computers had the same problem. I have another USB to PS2/Converter and that works just fine on both computers. Unfortunately, I had no luck with the Trendnet one despite several attempts."
4,Works with a PS/2 Mouse,Have not had a chance to use it with a PS/2 keyboard but works with a PS/2 mouse perfectly. I am using it with a Dell Inspiron laptop.
4,TRENDnet = Rad,"I hate serial devices. They are slow, they are finicky, you never know if you will stay connected to it from one minute to the next. But I end up using them everyday as part of my job.And the last thing you want is a suspect serial port. You want that to be perfect so you know, if you are having comm trouble, that the USB to serial conversion is not the issue.This little blue guy works great. Absolutely no trouble with 4 different converters. I highly recommend it. It is cheap and reliable. Which is more than I can say for some of the equipment I work on."
5,convert PS2 to USB,TRENDnet USB to PS/2 Converter TU-PS2 (Blue)This item so far has been working just great on my windows 7 machine using my PS2 mouse and keyboard.No cons to mention it just simple does what it was designed to do.
4,It works,After installing the software and plugging it in it worked well. I got this to transfer data from a website to a Garmin E-Trex Legend and it worked well. After getting the software installed on the computer there were no issues.
5,Easy to install,I purchased this to connect the Equus 3140 Innova Diagnostic Code Scanner for OBDI and OBDII Vehicles (Automotive) to my desktop (windows 7) and my laptop (Vista). The driver installed easily and the connection was flawless.
4,Trendnet TU-S9 USB to Serial converter with Win 7,Trendnet USB to Serial converter TU-S9Trendnet USB to Serial converterI'm using this converter on a HP laptop running 64 bit Windows 7 to link to an old Megellan MAP330 GPS. It works great and installed its driver without any problems. Configuring it to use one of only four ports the MAP330 uses was just as easy. I didn't need technical support so I can't speak to how good or bad they are.
1,Driver is unstable. Crashes Windows Vista and 7 systems. BSOD,I have tried this on both Windows Vista and Windows 7 (64-bit) and the driver causes the system to BSOD shortly after you begin using it. This happens every time.I downloaded the newest version from their website and it did not resolve the problem. I would not recommend this until they fix the Windows driver.I was able to get it to work under Linux without any issues.
2,Faulty,I did not have a serial connection on my notebook - So I purchased this item based on (other people not needing the disc/drivers to be installed and they were saying it works perfectly out of the box.)This item is not defective in any way and works on com6 on my notebook when I try to connect to a Cisco Console Port. Only problem I have is that every time I disconnect and reconnect the usb adapter - the driver is never recognized and I have to reinstall the product over every time I would like to use it. And it seems that the driver never releases the com port properly so even when I disconnect the physical connection it still makes my computer think there is a device attached when there isn't.I am not saying everyone will have this issue. The pc I am running is an HP notebook with windows xp pro sp3 installed. It is a clean installation - only thing on the PC is a Cisco VPN Client and the drivers for the notebook.
5,Worked Like a Champ,"This product worked perfectly, and I have not had any issues with it whatsoever. After I installed the drivers, everything that I have used with it has worked without a hitch."
1,Didn't work for me,"Returned all three units I purchased for my office. I tried to connect three brand new PS2 Adesso keyboards to our Dell PCs, but they all resulted in horrible screen errors and stuck Ctrl keys. Returned for a full refund."
1,Not for my HP430 plotter.,Don't buy the TRENDnet USB to Parallel 1284 Converter for plotters. It doesn't work. Finally got product-maker agent to tell me as much. Packaging doesn't say that it doesn't work for some parallel-port products.
1,Complete waste of time and money...,"I bought 3 of these for some new Dell desktops but after hours of very poor ""help"" from Trendnet tech support (including 3 hangups on me) and one shorted OKI 320 power supply I finally decided to give Trendnet the boot. I bought PCI parallel cards and was up and running in minutes."
3,Buyer Beware,"I have a porblem with this thing. I have vista the CD install fast and easy but when I plug this in it keeps searching for a driver after 3 days it's still searching. My mom has vista also the converter did install on her pc after a few mins. and it does work. That's why I'm giving this 3 stars but I think it's worth 0 stars. I WISH NOW I NEVER BOUGHT THIS.The pro: It does work, does what it sopose to do. Just beware.Maybe buy one at a local store for easy return.Up date: Got it to work.here's how went to website downloaded the driver there (think it's the same as CD)Did not use win98 vista choose autorun application.I'm very happy nowhope this helps.Still buyer bewareIf you have the system Requirements it should not be this hard to install."
4,WORKS AS LISTED,THIS ADAPTER WORKED BUT IT DID NOT LIKE THE KVM EXTENDER OR THE EXTENDER DID NOT LIKE IT.WILL WORK FINE IN A NORMAL APPLICATION.QUALITY CONSTRUCTION THROUGHOUT.
2,Did not work for me,"I have a 12 year old HP Laserjet 6p that I wished to connect to my new Dell 8500 running win 8, but new boxes lack parallel ports. The printer is so reliable that I took a risk on this and spent the better part of 2 afternoons trying my best to make it work. Bought the original 8088pc in early 80's...this is my 13-15th machine. I know how to make things work, but the drivers don't seem to be available to run this old dinosaur via USB. I finally dropped back and ordered a STAR PCIe adapter (on Amazon) and (after a few fits - see that review) got the venerable printer to work like a charm. So this product MAY work fine depending on your uses but for me it was a flop."
1,wouldn't work...,Wouldn't work whth hp photosmart 1115 and new windows 7 computer. just could not get it to work and I know what I was doing. I must have spent 3 hours trying to get it to work.
2,Good as a PS/2 to USB adapter BUT not good for both,"My inention was to use this product on a PS/2 mouse and keyboard and plug into a USB Port. As it turned out, I could only use it as a single adapter (mouse OR keyboard) because my Dell 530 (and 530s) would not recognize the mouse. I ended up buying another one of these adapters but the same thing happened. So, I ended up buying 2 and using up 2 USB Ports. I guess I should have known better."
2,Only for 32bit OS - No Drivers for Vista x64 or Windows 7 x64,Trendnet makes a good product. I have a network printer server from them and it works great. I did some research before purchasing this item and it was supposed to be compatible with Vista. However it does not work with Vista x64 bit. I emailed support and they said it was not compatible and they had no immediate plans to make a 64-bit driver available.
3,Good for Windows 7,"The Mac driver for this device does not work with Lion (OSX 10.7), the windows driver worked well when I ran boot camp with Windows 7. Worked great in for consoling into Cisco routers through Windows 7, really wanted it for Mac. Checked the TRENDnet site for an updated driver set, no luck. Oh well, such is life."
4,Nice quality USB to Serial Adapter,I have used many USB to serial adapters in the past ... I managed to loose my last one so I decided to go to a new brandThe extra long nature of the device and well constructed serial end set this one apart from the last devices I used and has come in handy I will probably go with this Brand again in the future
2,Repeats Key Strokes,"I am going return this item. It on occasion will repeat keystrokes from the keyboard. This just irritating when typing a document but the other day I hit the delete key to erase an email and it chose at that time to repeat and started deleting all my other email. I ended up having to recover over 20 emails that the repeating key had deleted before I got it to stop ( by madly depressing the offending key ) Amazon is pretty good and sent me a replacement but as it turns out it wasn't that the first one I purchased was bad, there is a flaw in the device design itself. After reading other low reviews I learned that this has been a problem in the past."
5,great item,you will need this cable to hook your innova 3160B to your computer to search the web to fine what is wrong with your car
2,Slow response,"It worked, but there was an irritating lag between the time I pressed a key and the letter or symbol or whatever appearing on the monitor. Sometimes I had to press the space bar 3, 4, even 5 times to get it to register. I really wanted it to work because I like my ""vintage"" (2004) keyboard, but I gave up and returned it."
4,order i placed,it was on time and in excl. shape i would buy again they were very fast with my order and on time
3,"If you need it, buy it :)","For some unknown reason, when I bought an Innova 3140b Diagnostic Code Scanner for OBDI and OBDII Vehicles, Amazon suggested that, ""people who bought the Innova 3140b also bought this cable converter""So, I thought I would need it.BUTWhen I got the package, I didn't need it. The Innova came with a computer cable connector (USB)Have a good one.JAR"
3,serial converter,"I got this to transfer files from my household computers to one we had that had the CD drive crash. The concept was great, but it comes with software that needed to be downloaded & with no working CD drive, it didn't work on the computer I bought it for. However, it has worked on the other computers. I will keep it as it will most likely be utilized in updating/transferring files in the future."
1,Not For Garmin etrex Legend and Mac 10.5,"I purchased this so hopefully I could download my geocaching information from my Mac to my Garmin etrex Legend, instead of finding a PC that has the old pin system. Why the Garmins don't come with the, now standard, USB connection or sell them separately, I don't know. In any event, I saw this had worked for someone on a different model and thought I'd give it a shot. I could be doing something wrong, but it absolutely did not work for me as my GPS wasn't recognized on my machine. Perhaps it has other uses, but I have to give it a one star as it didn't do what I wanted."
1,"Doesn't work, waste of money.",This didn't work. The program I am using it for crashes when I select the COM port that this thing is emulating. It's better just to buy the PCI card with serial ports on it.
1,Scratched C/D,"I'm sure the music on the C/D is great, but it is hard to enjoy when the C/D is scratched and skips.Not happy with this purchase."
2,"1 star for Graphics,1 Star for shootout","What did you think I was going to rate this game?The game play sucks!Checking,passing,shooting are all unrealistic.The only thing that holds the game together are graphics and the shootout which is very realistic how the goalie moves.The goalies are very realistic though, with saves and A.I. but once a game allow a fluke goal from the blueline.The other good thing is the stick control,very nicely done.But still what hurts the game is passing,shooting,and checking!"
1,They did not test this game. It's pointless.,No way to win a faceoff. Played video hockey games since they first came out and this is the worst. You would think EA Sports would try out the games before shipping them.
2,EA doesn't seem to know what it is doing,"This game is horrible. Your team's ai is must have came to the game in the short bus because they are stupid. Whenever I skate up the ice, my own players get in my way and I end up losing the puck. And they can't defend worth anything, I can't count how many times my computer controlled defensemen were caught out of position resulting in an odd-man rush. The opponet's ai is able to pole check and read passes way too easily. The hit stck is just a joke, it's not accurate and when you miss your player is pretty much screwed because he just stands there. And what is with the players poke checking, does EA not realize that you can move and poke check at the same time? The manual shot aim is worthless, most of the time it ends up being sucked up right into the goalies glove. And the computer scores on the softest goals but you actually have to work for a goal."
2,it is REALLY small,"It appears to be many of them, but the box is very small and the ginshen roots are extremely small."
5,Well-written and fascinating,"`That Complex Whole' works on several levels both within the field of anthropology and for readers outside of the field. Within anthropology, I can think of at least three levels: as a meaningful springboard for discourse among professional anthropologists, as a tool for graduate students in anthropology who seek to understand the history and complexities of their field, as a resource for undergraduates who are discovering ways to study human behavior. In addition to anthropologists, biologists interested in the evolution of human behavior will also be enlightened by this book. Anyone interested in human behavior will find they can understand the topic as it is described in this book. Cronk uses examples from science fiction and popular culture that illuminate his points in a funny, sometimes laugh-out-loud way. The book invites you to think about science, human behavior, biology, and evolution in new ways. I highly recommend it."
2,"Nice pictures, but thats it","This book was more or less a waster of money for me. It had some (really only a few) good pictures of wooden fences and gates that I was looking for, and the rest were more artsy metal and masonry. The instructions on building were for very simple fences and gates, which I already knew and found for free on the internet. I was really looking for pictures or instructions on building an outstanding fence and gate."
1,Don't Bother,"First of all, ""Iron Eyes Cody"" is not Native American (Indian); he is Italian. While some of the signs in this book are valid, a number are not. A couple are misleading or just flat wrong. If you truly want to learn hand talk, buy the William Tompkins book on the subject. That way if you're around real Native Americans, they won't laugh at you for using the wrong signs. Maybe just tease you for your ""accent"". Aaaaaayyyyy!"
3,How do I review a gift?,The person I gave it to seemed happy... I have no clue? I have eight more words to meet some requirement for review! *whew* I made it.
2,Jazzmasters?,"I recently purchased The Jazzmasters Greatests Hits CD, and not being familiar with the entire Jazzmasters catalog, I could not tell why some of the songs chosen were considered great, or hits. Don't get me wrong, I like some Paul Hardcastle, especially Hardcastle 2, and of course Nineteen, but this disc suffers from the bland. Stand out cuts here are all available on Hardcastle 2 (Bird Island, Peace On Earth, and Joker's Wild). The song London Chimes echos of an ambient groove, which may be more descriptive of Hardcastle's music. When I think of jazz masters, I think of Miles Davis and others. So with this disc what you get is hypnotic rhythm tracks that may put you to sleep, if your not careful. Jazzmasters, I think not. Ambientgroovemasters....yes definitely."
5,14 instrumental cuts of pure intoxication,"For the typical Hardcastle fan, there is no such thing as a ""best of"" because all of his work is so awesome. I consider all of the Hardcastle / Jazzmasters releases to be masterpieces. But this one puts the highlights of each into one convenient package - plus the new cut - which is superb. Highly recommended as usual!"
5,Jazzmasters G/H,"When Paul release the greatest hits and after listing to it this is a must have for me.Iwould recommend for all of you who love smooth jazz.Paul is unique and his music is like a breath of fresh air . This CD is smooth soothing and relaxing just like all of the aft release cd's.I say to all of you smooth jazz lover go get yourself ""Lost is Space"" you would not want to comeback"
2,Un-Original,"This album is mostly covers, so it's unfair to say they are not the original recordings. Stay, however, was a hit for Muarice Williams and the Zodiacs and even it is not the original hit recording.The only reason I gave it two stars instead of one is because I have a penchant for covers. I would suggest this CD only for others that have a similar passion for covers. Even then, the work is sub-par."
4,Very good game - I enjoyed it,"This is a very good action/adventure game for the PSP. It is one of the few actions games that is not a shooter, although there is quite a bit of gun play at times.It took me quite awhile to play the entire game, which is good. There is quite a bit there. Excellent graphics, very good story. The biggest knock would be the controls. It is very easy to send Lara over a cliff because your joystick was not positioned just so when you made her jump. Other than that, I really enjoyed the game a lot. A must-have for PSP if you like action/adventure games."
3,Great game,"Wish I would have seen the fine print, didnt see it just came with game and no case, my bad i guess."
2,This is not a PSP game.,"This was one of my favorite games for the original Xbox, so I didn't hesitate when I saw the PSP version. Unfortunately, the camera controls for the PSP version are horrific -- especially when facing a time sensitive bounce-from-pillar-to-pillar situation (while trying to control this ridiculous camera system) making what should be a edge-of-your-seat experience into one that will have you questioning whether this classic came from a fiery pit. In full, AVOID THIS FOR PSP... or better yet, just skip to the sequel: Tomb Raider Anniversary."
4,tom raider legend game por psp.,"This game was working very good at the biggining, but when my daughter was advance into the game now it is not working anymore.Now We are so sad. We can I do?. I don't know if I can change it for other that works. The same game title.Maria Zulma Asla"
5,Great for teaching,This is such a great video! I use it to help my students with learning multiplication. It also is fun for me to walk down memory lane when this was on tv.
1,Worse game ever,This game was completely horrible. I would never recommend it to anyone. I should have looked into it before I bought it. DO NOT BUY!!
1,Horrible game!,"Maybe it was the fact that I had never seen the show, or maybe its the fact that its really boring and confusing, but either way don't buy it. I thought it was too, too complex. Most of the time I didn't know what they were asking me to do. And it gets really frustrating. But, if you are a masochist then you'll like it, I guess."
2,"Not for me, unfortunately","Though I have played many detective style games on a PC, this is my first on DS. Just too small for me and not pleasurable to work through.Tons of Tiny text, dark screens. I find this game time consuming and tiresome with so many search/player options. Must flip from tab to tab, take a swab, go to lab go back to interview...back to lab, back to scene again, etc. Would be easier to see and play on PC.Recently have played many types of DS games, and unfortunately this is ranked lowest for me. When I have played through my other games I may give this one another shot..."
1,This Game Sucks And Is To Hard For Me,This Game Is To Hard For Me And It Takes Forever To Figuare Out. So This Game Sucks! Do Not Buy It!
5,Off The Hook,I thought the book was great. It was one of those books that made you want more and more. I don't read as often as I should but after starting this book I couldn't put it down until I was finish. This is a book I will be giving to many of my friends because everyone should have this in there collection. Renee did a great job and I can see many more good books to come being written by her.
4,Enjoyable Read...,"I found Ms. Allen's, ""The Kiss of Judas,"" to be an enjoyable read. Loved the title of the book, it got my attention right from the start. The characters are well-developed, the dialogue fresh, and the plot interesting. A very appealing combination.John SavoySavoy InternationalMotion Pictures"
1,"Great tool, but only when it works","I am on my second of these impact drivers having had the first one replaced by my local rep due to awful battery life. The replacement unit is just as bad. Even following the mfg's instructions exactly in order to maximize the battery life, the battery discharges rapidly (over just a few weeks) when not in use and I'm left with having to charge it before each use just to get more than a few screws in before it dies. I am an experienced woodworker and hobbyist and own many cordless tools. My 7 yr old 14.4 volt DeWalt with a NiCad battery lasts much longer both in use and storage than this new Panasonic with what should be far superior NiMH batteries. Don't buy it unless you want to be tethered to the charger, in which case a corded tool would be better."
4,Framing tool,"If you can't drive nails this tool sure beats regular drivers. Drives 3.5""deck srews easily with no predrilling,{minimal pressure required} but you have to use square drive. Phillips screws strip out quickly and bits die quick, even tho very careful. Square drive will last 5-600 drives on these long fasteners. Battery dies kind of quick tho. Even after several cycles and charging for 24 hours each time you can only frame one 16 foot wall, maybe 70 of this length on one battery. Would be interested in other's experience on this. small, lightweight, overall pretty amazing. clutch actually works. Just improve battery and/or charger."
3,Missing two songs,"Where's ""Hard To Be Humble"" & ""Hooked On Music""? you can't have a complete greatest hit's without those two songs sheesh."
5,Excellent Collection,"This is far better than the ""Greatest Hits"" collection from the past. The selection for me is all the top songs that I have enjoyed on the lp records that I still have. The only additional song that I would liked to have seen included is ""The Way You Look Today"" which got very little airplay but is a great song.Mac Davis is still alive and well and just turned 69 earlier this month. The reviewer, ""Idahostreet"" is wrong about his death choking on a ham sandwich in a Paris hotel."
3,Mac Davis...in general,"Is there a fan club contact for Mac? He is still living, yes? I remember his #1 hit, ""Don't get hooked on me"". I loved the song and the tune. (I was born in 1964, so unfortunately I don't remember all of the songs.) My mother, Judy, told me with pride when I was young, that her brother, Bill and Mr. Davis were very good friends when they were living in Lubbock, TX. I would like to get in touch with Mr. Davis about my uncle. I also agree, that it would be nice to hear his music as well as others from his ""era"" on the radio again."
1,Best of? Best of what?!,"How can they have a best of Mac Davis CD without ""Rhinestone Cowboy"" and ""Convoy""? I want my money back. He needs to cut his hair like Jon Bon Jovi did and re-invent himself."
5,Exactly what I needed.,Keeps things cold as it should. Size is perfect for me for a spot on my boat. Price and delivery was great.
5,Best Commentary on the Minor Prophets,"This work is the best commentary on the Minor Prophets from a conservative, dispensational, premillennial viewpoint. The work is ideally suited for pastors or serious Bible students. It is not tedious, but definitely scholarly and well researched.The strength of this book is its purpose, interpretation. It is not intended to be a popular commentary with an accent on application, but seeks to focus upon discerning the text. Yet it does not get tedious with grammatical overkill.As a pastor of over 20 years, it is the first book I reach for (after my Bible) when studying the Minor Prophets. I rarely sense a need to reach for another."
5,A Scholarly Introduction,"I'm glad to see this out in paperback, I prize my earlier hardback edition for its depth and breadth.Feinberg brings the contents of these twelve books to life with his knowledge of their cultural environments within the sweep of Biblical prophecy. This book provides help in applying the words of these writers to modern life.If you're going to buy one book on the minor prophets this should be it."
3,"An established work, reliable","With a Hebrew backround He brings some insight not normally found, his work is solid but not a page turner, more of reference book, the information is there but you won't rush home to pick it up. Like another tool in the box any study of the minor prophets should include this book. Published by Moody in paper back, type setting is of current design with good paper."
5,Good Study,Feinberg is right on with all of his analogy of all the Minor Prophets. A must read for all who look for clarification of scripture.
4,"Overall good, but somewhat incomplete","This is a nice ""coffee table"" book with lots of rare photographs and drawings . The book is focused on the architecture of past World's Fairs, and the author chooses expositions that he considers to be architecturally significant. This means that his choices are a bit arbitrary, and also, because of their transient nature, most of the buildings at World's Fairs will eventually be torn down. The author basically ignores most of the World's Fairs that have taken place in the last 25 years, and doesn't mention some landmarks from recent World's Fairs, that have become part of the buildings that define a city, such as the Canada Place building from Expo '86 in Vancouver, that is a key part of that city's architecture now."
1,"Too bulky, cups did not fit well","Did not like this bra. I was looking for support without squashing, but found it to be too bulky overall and did not fit well in the cup size. I returned it for a refund. Straps were comfortable, but overall the underwire area was too bulky and uncomfortable."
5,What an Excellent Book to Read,"I was very pleased with this book, a sweet story about Clark growing up in a rural area. Just as pleasant had the pleasure of meeting him in person at a book signing, was nice to put a face with the story of the little boy and Patch. Recommend this for reading and also a good book to read to someone else."
4,Disaster thriller will have you burning through the pages.,"Weather abnormalities lead a group of (U.S.) government scientists to a horrifying discovery, the constant polluting of the enviroment has triggered a green house effect that will, come summertime, literally bake thousands of people to death. Herzog extrapolates the effects of the disaster nicely, although many today will find the character and political intrigue rather cliche. Nonetheless it remains a good disaster thriller worth checking out. Recommended."
1,a GLARING error,"I like the idea of tracing God's redemptive plan throughout the Bible, but the execution of that idea here is terrible. The worst error is on p.282- ""a dove flew down and rested on Jesus."" Actually, the Holy Spirit came down like a dove and rested on him. Writing in a bird in place of the Spirit is inexcusable. The other one and two star reviews here have good points as well-all describing genuine shortcomings of this book. I recommend that it be avoided."
2,We had to put it away,"This was recommended by other parents at my church so I was excited to show it to my two year old son. We went straight to the story of Noah. The images are, granted, easy for kids to understand, but the image of the flood was a bit too easy to understand and my son became afraid of the book. Even seeing it in storage, he'd have an anxious reaction to it.Years later, we tried again and the first story we read used the word ""punish"" in a place it wasn't used in the Bible. I understand some interpret the text that way, but we don't. I understand it's a difficult thing to bring the story to a child's level without making interpretations that will alter meaning. That's why I was willing to pay money for the diligence that would go into that, but I didn't get what I paid for.I might try vetting each story before letting the kids read it or use it to show how our culture colors our interpretation of the Bible when they are old enough to understand."
1,Fire and brimstone...,"I am sure this bible story book is great for families who want to teach their children an extremely conservative, fear-based view of religion. The text of some of the stories is rather severe (lots of ""punishing"", anger and ""he**"" references), and it would have been important for me to know that before buying the book. I would not have bought it in the first place, and it is going right back. This book is not for people who want to convey more of God's love and the lessons of forgiveness that Jesus teaches us. I would not read the Old Testament stories to my children for fear of scaring them right out of their faith."
5,Great Bible Story Book for Toddlers,"I love this Bible Story book. While it does not have all of the popular stories, it does carry the ""big picture"" of what the Bible is about through out it. It is easy to read and my toddlers have enjoyed it and already learned a lot. I highly recommend this product for toddlers."
5,Great!,"This is a very good introductory step for kids to the Bible stories. Stories are short enough that my 3 year old can listen and comprehend, but still manage to convey the story.--My only negative that I had to get past was that it doesn't carry much word-for-word scripture, but it does manage to bring home the big picture of God's love for us."
5,Great overview of the Bible,We were very pleased with this overview of the Bible for Children. The artwork is beautiful and the story is well written and accurate.
5,Accurate Picture of Who God Is,I have been reading this a couple pages each day to my toddler. I think the illustrations and the story line give a wonderful picture of how awesome our God is truly is. The book is a beautiful book and I'll probably read it repeatedly with my children.
1,what is this?,season four? i have already bought part one. now i have to buy one and two to get to see two? what a rip off...
4,"Covers evenly, naturally","I have very sensitive skin, but find this foundation works well for me, no irritation. It covers evenly and naturally, without looking like a mask. It stays as well as other liquid foundations (I always wish they would last longer, thus 4stars), but I don't even follow up with powder. As a bonus, I also understand that Revlon does NOT experiment on animals.Revlon Age Defying Makeup with Botafirm, SPF 20, Normal/Combination Skin, Fresh Ivory 01, 1.25-Ounce"
5,same great product; half the price,"I've used the Revlon Age Defying Makeup for as long as I've been defying my age, but lately I haven't been able to find the shade I like in local stores. The texture is light and creamy, smoothing out my skin and concealing some lighter patches and freckles on my face. The price was about half what I would have paid in local stores and on drugstore.com."
1,Revlon Age Defying Makeup with Botafirm,Revlon Age Defying Makeup with Botafirm ... I had orded 5 bottles and had a confirmed order number for the 5 bottles and an email the 5 bottles had been shipped. Then I got an email saying 4 bottles would be credited to my account because they couldn't send them ?????? what's up with that?
5,Ghost In the Wire,"Ghost in the wire is a fascinating account on the Vietnam war. I was riveted to the book, and didn't want to put it down, it was like a roller coaster. I difinately have mixed emotions of the Vietnam War, wondering if it's a just war or not, but this book took all of the politics out and it was just an awesome read. I believe it's a must read for anyone."
2,The music from the '90 must be better than this?,"Wreckx-N-Effect 'Rump Shaker' was a hit? OMG this stuff is trash. There are a couple of tunes that aren't personally offensive but we all have our own tastes, but for me this will never get added to my collect. Just a waste of money and my time.Walk away....."
1,RE-RECORDING ALERT!!!,"If I could give this less than a star, I would. Unless you enjoy re-recordings of older tracks, you don't want this CD. Did they really think that they could pass this stuff off as original?"
5,"A very, very, very wonderful fantasy","This is one of the best movies I have ever seen! Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd are fantastic. Robert Zemeckis, who later on would direct such jewels as Forrest Gump and Castaway, shows just how good of a director he is and his ability to have a little fun while doing it to. I have seen this film countless times, and I NEVER have gotten bored during it. If you have not seen it yet, you will have a blast with this outstanding film from the eighties. I can't wait until the DVD release!"
5,BRING BACK TO THE FUTURE BACK!,"Please bring ""Back to the Future"" back in DVD format!! Great movie and will live on as one of Michael J. Fox's finest! While you're at it do the whole series (1,2 and 3) in DVD. We'll be waiting impatiently!!!"
4,Back to the Best Future Ever,"this is a really cool movie! i've seen it over ten times and i bought it and the other two also they were just as cool.i'm not a fan of science fiction but for this movie i'll make an exeption . Christopher Lloyd is one of my favorite actors and did a very good comedic role in this. i was a fanatic over this movie for a whole summer and even went by doc sometimes and out of nowhere i would sometimes just burst out, great scot! back to the future is a great movie!"
4,Liked it but....,"I really enjoyed this movie the first few times I saw it, but after that it just isn't exciting, moving, or believable enough to enjoy over and over again.This is a wonderful little movie about travling to the past, and Michael J. Fox is wonderful at making his character work. Christopher Lloyd is always fun to watch and he fits the character of the mad scientist very well.Like I mentioned, this is a very enjoyable film, just don't over watch it. It will loose some of its effect."
1,Had to return,"Spent 30 minutes trying to get this to load. Would come up to the menu, but when you tried to go further it wouldn't work. Amazon's customer service was very helpful. Ended up downloading it from Comcast. With four little kids, was shocked at how much cursing there was for a PG movie."
5,Do the time warp!,"This is a pretty fun movie which is a cool look at time travel. I cannot help but love Christopher Lloyd in his role as the mad scientist, and the idea of a car that can travel through time is hard to not like. Of the 80's, this is definitely one of the best films of the decade."
5,Classic,"Just plain fun. I love sci fi and I love this movie. Please, watch it with your kids, pass it on before it loses relevance..."
5,Back To The Future,This movie is the greatest! I watch it a zillion times! whenever it comes out again you have to buy it if you havn't already. if you don't have a chance to buy it then rent it somewhere! This movie is about teenager in highschool who travels in time and tries to get his parents together before disapears from existance! with the help from the 1955 doc Brown he can get back to 1985. So there is a little summery on the greatest movie of all time. Amazon you have to get it back on here!
5,Great start to a fantastic series!,"Back To The Future is a great movie which starts out a great series. I liked the whole concept of travelling through time. Doc Brown and Marty are two hilarious charcters, as is the bad guy, Biff. In this movie, Marty accidentally goes back into time from 1985 to 1955 and has to make his parents fall in love all over again. With the 1955 Doc Brown helping him, he gets his parents to fall in love, so he will still exist in 1985. He even beats up Biff and that makes his family a happier family in 1985 when he comes back to the future. And Biff is washing his new car! But there still is trouble... in the future! Watch part 2 to find out! Overall this movie is very innovative and fun to watch, and I recommend it to everyone 9 and up, because I was 9 when I first watched it."
5,Hilarious,Back to the Future is a hilarious movie full of great performances that is entertaining time after time; and it is relatively clean too.
5,Such a great movie,"My wife and I got a bit nostalgic as we were talking about movies from the 80's. We decided to rent Back to the Future and we are so glad we did. If you haven't seen it recently, or at all, I would highly recommend this movie."
4,THE BEP'S THOUGHTS ON BTTF 1,"This is a great film with plenty of action, suspense, comedy and a great story. Marty McFly played by Michael J. Fox is an average teen who ends up going thirty years back in time and has to worry about making sure his parents get together and that he can get back to his own time with the help of Doc Brown played by Christopher Lloyd. This is a must-see if ur a fan of either science fiction, adventure or comedy."
4,GOOD MOVIE I LOVED IT,THIS IS A GOOD MOVIE ONE THE BEST MOVIES OF ALL THIME IT GRAIET ENTERTANMEMENT IT HAD PLENT OF ACTPON COMEDY AND AVERTERE HAD TO MUCH BAD WORDS THOUGH SEE PART 2 IT IS EVEN BETTER THANE THIS ONE.
5,Fast-paced time travel adventure...,"This is one of those movies that seems complicated enough, but is surprisingly easy to follow. Michael J. Fox plays Marty McFly, a 17-year-old high school student whose best buddy is Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd). One night, Brown introduces Marty to something extraordinary: a time machine made from a DeLorean. Soon, Marty is thrust back into the 50s and finds himself hooking his parents up on their first date. But just around the corner is bully Biff Tannen. This incredible film launched an awesome trilogy that has finally hit DVD. It remains director Robert Zemeckis' best work."
5,Best adventure/comedy ever written. Can't wait for THX,From the Twin Pine Mall start to the Lone Pine Mall finish. Creative wrangling of time imspires the imagination of all that see.
5,"Back to the Future, a GREAT trilogy","Back to the Future is a movie you could watch over and over again, and not get tired of it. This is a movie that keeps you into it the entire way. Unlike some movies, where the beginning is boring, and it picks up as it goes along. Doctor Emmett Brown(Christopher Lloyd)invents a time machine out of a DeLorean. His friend, Marty McFly(Michael J. Fox)accidently sends himself back to the year 1955. Marty ends up being stuck in the year 1955, when there is only one person who can help him, Doc of 1955. Be sure to see Back to the Future II and Back to the Future III and the first. All three are great movies. But you won't now it all if you don't see the first."
5,Back to the future rules!!!!!!!!!!,"I believe without a doubt that back to the future is the best film ever!!!! It has everything you'd want in a film exitement, comedy, action, adventure, you name it, it's got it! Michael J Fox is my all time favourate actor and this is one of his best acting credits along with the two sequels which are also very good.I hope it does come to DVD because it deserves it more than any other film. Back to the future rules!!!!!!!!!(Michael J Fox is gorgeous!!!!!!!!)"
2,Just one extra disc and poor widescreen,"I'm not very happy at this item.First off, they say its wide screen. Well, instead of seeing what was cut off along the sides, they blew the original picture up so that it now cuts off what's on the top and bottoms.There's no extra stuff on Disc 1, not even the Cigarette Commercial, and disc 2 is okay, but still this wasn't what I expected."
3,Really movie-like movie,"As a tenager in the real life 1980's I personally testify that no one had life like the fictional character of Marty McFly in BTTF. Nobody! His whole life, dialogue, situations all totally Hollywod style and thus movie-like. Oh yeah-- and we didn't travel around in cars that could go back in time eithr."
2,Only one Good Thing about this release...,"When Back to the Future came out as a Trilogy Box Set on DVD i was very disappointed. The picture quality is very good, the sound.... but....Come one... Where are the individual Boxes with original Cover Art? For me this release is the only thing good that has...But in my opinion, picking up these movies to watch, i pick the Letterbox Edition on Laserdisc and most of the times the Muse Hi-Vision Laserdisc Edition and watch them in 1080i Full HD. The DVD or even Blu Ray cannot match the Laserdisc Cover Art... besides those are the Original Ones.Much better than DVD, natural and original colors, and it's the Best way to watch Back to the Future until now...Let's see what Blu Ray brings to us, but i am expecting HOT Picture and Sound!! :)"
3,Where is this on Blu Ray?,"These are great films, but I'm not spending a dime on another DVD release. These need to be re-mastered and available on Blu Ray."
2,Doesn't work,UNFORTUNATELY....the DVD does not work. :( :( :(It starts to play...then STOPS. Upon examining the disc....it has scratches on it. VERY DISSAPPOINTED with this purchase.
5,Back in Time!,"This is the hit movie classic that made both Michael J. Fox and Christopher Llyod famous. Not that they weren't known from their previous works, but the characters they portrayed in these films are who immediately come to mind when I hear their names. Created in 1985 is still reaches out to a generation 15 years in the future ... and I reckon it'll be popular past 2015 as well. It's a classic, fast paced and very ingenious. Not to mention the excellent casting. If you haven't seen it, DO SO NOW. If you have, well, buy it again! Or go rewatch it."
4,An absolute classic....that deserves to be on DVD!!!,"I find it confusing that I can walk into a DVD store (such as Circuit City or SunCoast), and find tons and tons of DVD movies of lame stuff I could care less about filling the shelves. However, imaginative box-office smashes like Back to The Future do not find their way to one of the most advanced home entertainment technologies available to the public right now, DVD. What is wrong with this picture?!"
5,"The Movie and the Ride, COMBINED!","If you're a BTTF fan, like me, but does not yet have the movie on DVD, this is the best possible version to purchase! Not only does it come with the movie and a boatload of extras, it also comes with the Universal ride posted right on your TV screen! I never got the chance to ride it before it shut down, so this was a grand chance for me! It comes with the pre-ride video, intro to the ride, and a recreation of the actual ride. For extras, it comes with deleted scenes, cast interviews, previews, and more. Highly reccomended!"
2,Juvenile sci-fi gimmick film.,"This strangely over-praised (except by me) film is heavy-handed and overdone in all departments, from the over-acting to the ultra-caricatured characterizations to the various ""clever"" time travel ideas. Most viewers are probably not aware that the ideas are all lifted from well-known science fiction writers. A teenage boy of the 1980s travels back to the 1950s and, of course, we get the usual jokes about the absurdity of Ronald Reagan being president, or of a colored boy ever becoming a mayor, etc. The ""circle in time"" gimmick also gets a workout two or three times. (Once would not be enough, of course.) One gag that really is funny is the time traveler's amazement at a super-efficient 1955 filling station."
5,Back To The Future,This is an awesome movie. back to the future is one of the best movies of all time. this is such a great movie. this is a classic christopher lloyd and michael j fox are great together in this movie. it is full of comedy and surprises. i love this movie. if you have not sen this movie then i recommend you do
1,Average,"An average book by less than average authors in the field. Best avoided, not even the presence of the Allaire hang-on Mr Forta can rescue this damp squid."
5,Excellent starter book about ColdFusion!,"If you want to start learning ColdFusion and are a Dreamweaver MX user, this is the book to get. It will guide you step by step through the basic concepts you need to know to get started. After completing this book you will be ready to move on to one of more advanced books. I bought Ben Forta's book first and tried several times to start learning ColdFusion, and failed. Now, after going through the ""Visual QuickPro Guide"", Forta's book makes more sence. The best beginners guide out there!"
5,Superb step-by-step guide,"This is an excellent, easy to understand, step by step guide to the application programming aspects of building dynamic ColdFusion MX web sites with Dreamweaver MX. The book covers both the wizard-like, fill-in-the-blank approach, using Dreamweaver's server behaviors, as well as CFML hand-coding. The authors' style is easy to understand, and the concepts are laid out in a ""task oriented"" format that allows the reader to skip to a particular section to learn a troubling concept without having to build an entire application that starts in the first chapter. This book is a top notch learning tool."
5,ColdFusion developing for Dreamweaver users,The authors deliver an excellent introduction to ColdFusion developing for Dreamweaver users. Maybe the best book available on the market for HTML people that needs to go one step further and want to get started with application developing
5,A great introduction to dynamic sites with ColdFusion MX,"If you already create HTML pages with Dreamweaver MX, this book is a great way to learn about databases and application servers via ColdFusion MX. The concepts are easy to understand, and the book is highly recommended."
5,Fabulous CD,Purchased for X-Mas Gift....This is one of the best with Johnny Mystro's fantastic voice. Worth every penny of purchase price. Highly recommend this CD.
3,Good But...,".... it only gets 3 stars because it is missing the essential Crests' first - ""My Juanita"" from 1958."
1,"If you like do-wop & a bit of rock and roll, you'll like this","Lots of catchy tunes, and some nice ballads I spend hours with 'trouble in paradise' running thru my head."
5,Great Product,"This is my second TI035 Timer, and it works as it should. Easy to install, and setup. I picked this model, because I wanted to use CF bulbs, in an outside post light. The timer is in my attached garage, and in the Detroit area, it gets well below the manufacture's temp range. I installed it in the shared wall, between the house and garage. So far, so good."
5,a move to Aube,"I gave up on the Intermatic timers and after checking out timers on line, got two Aube T1034A-3W timers. They were simple to install and the programming wasn't too difficult at all.Unlike the Intermatic timers, the aube units are very flush and do not stick out from the faceplate.The manual may be a bit confusing, but a quick reread results in it making sense. I'll be watching to see how well the timers operate over the long haul. Someone noted that there is no battery backup -- the memory, so they save, holds programming for 30 days.My initial thought is that the move to Aube was definitely worth it!"
2,Cardboard!!!!,This sign is not real plastic. Cardboard covered with plastic film. Not water proof. During recent rain fell apart. I do not recommend it.
1,Inconsistent dimensions mentioned,"I would have loved to buy this product, but couldn't get past all the different dimensions mentioned. Under ""Product Specification"" is says 12""L x 23.5""W x 19.75""H. Under ""Technical Details"" it says 22""L x 12.25""W x 19.75""H. Then, under the ""Product Details"" it states 23.5""L x 12.25""W x 19.75""H. So, the only thing I can be assured of here is that it's 19.75 inches high. Maybe they'll fix these details to be correct in all regards, and not utterly confusing. I hope so. Otherwise, stay away until you know for sure. If it doesn't state the numbers I wrote, then hopefully that means they did fix it."
4,Way Better Than I Expected,"After a few lousy seasons with a lot of boring storylines, this season was great. The stories are more interesting, directed better, and some of them are really dark. One of the episodes, ""Dogs Best Friend,"" features a very graphic and disturbing rape scene that I just couldn't believe was ever allowed to air on television. I didn't like that or Gina's throwing up in the toilet--I don't really want to see that stuff when I'm watching 90210. Dylan's back of course right after Brandon and Val leave (not together). Like other reviewers,. I was hoping for a two hour finale but the one we're left with is really awesome and ends with a bang. Literally."
4,Ok season,I swear I have seen ever episode about 10-15 times!! This is my least favorite season out of the 10. I was so over Sophie being on the show. Glad to see her leave. How ever I was so sad to see Brandon leave. He should have stuck it out until the end. I only say this because I loved is part and he is darling. I was just as sad to see Val go 2 shows later. She was awesome and added so much to 90210. She helped make the show. So I was super bummed that 2 awesome pieces to the show left. I am such a big 90210 fan. I think the whole series is fantastic. One of the best shows and casts ever created.
3,Not as good,I have to agree that this season wasn't as good as the others that I have. I was hoping that this season would be jam packed with stuff. But it wasn't some of the season I had to skip because they were so not worth watching. I hope that season 10 it a lot better because it is the last.
1,Written by an obvious amateur,"This book offers little practical advice. The main focus of the ""book"" is on the personal life of the author and crime in the Miami area. It really isn't a ""book"" but a bound together sheaf of nothingness. Total rip-off. Don't waste your money. The information on the web is more informative."
4,"A lot of ""BS"" to read through, but the correct info is there","Richard Paull is not a great writer, a few marbles short maybe, but he knows a lot about tortoises. There are several ""tortoise and turtle"" books out there that do not have a clue about raising tortoises. I have been raising them for years and this book (and his others) and any information put out by Tortoise Trust can be trusted. Yes his ""dipping story"" is a little annoying, his humor a bit strange and you have to read through a lot of ""BS"" to get the information, but the info is there."
4,This book is a reference for Sulcata's Owner.,"I enjoyed this book, and I go back to it many times.... R.C. Paull writes with an easy style and a great sense of humor."
2,Maybe I Missed Something,"Maybe I missed something. The opening essay, contrasting European vs. American humor, is interesting, but not terribly thorough or convincing. Then there's a couple of instances of ""mental telegraphy"" which comes a little randomly (what's the point?), and finally storytelling, which seems to actually say that really good storytellers spin a yarn out for a long time, rather than anything specific as to how, or why. Most oddly, the joke done ""right"" and ""wrong"" by example is actually slightly better in the ""wrong"" version, as it has the virtue of brevity.Don't get me wrong; I like Mark Twain. ""Tom Sawyer"" etc. was pretty good, ""The Mysterious Stranger"" although incomplete is pretty cool, and ""Life on the Mississippi"" was unexpectedly fascinating. But this? Yeah, the price is right ($0), but I wouldn't recommend reading this unless you're on some kind of Twain marathon."
4,It was dry,"I like Twain. But I don't always appreciate all his work. It was an OK book. I didn't finish it, so I guess it was not that great. Don't know what I expected, but I just could not get into it. I will try again when I am in a different frame of mind."
4,Mark Twain extras,"Head, Shoulders, Knees and Toes (Baby Board Books)American writer Samuel Clemens, better known by his pen name Mark Twain has given us some literary gems with Tom Sawyer, Huckleberry Finn and his travel adventures in nineteenth-century Europe and to Australia and New Zealand. Here is is discussing telling rather than writing a story.Humour, he says, is American while comic is English and witty is French. He follows this typically brilliant essay with examples of story telling and some intriguing experiences of mental telegraphy.Good on you Dodo Press for specialising in rare and out-of-print books.Mark Twain devotees will want to add this slim volume to their collection."
1,Lacks Depth,"The book did start off on a good note, but it seems to lose track of scientific temper of research. Research is a structured investigation. Data sources seem inadequete & substantial bits are missing. Like author's first hand experience. This makes it look like a coverup for a frustrated minority."
1,A Half Baked Cake,"The best I can describe this book is as ""A Half Baked Cake"". However hard a cook might have tried to get the best ingridients, and the right temperature in the oven, the best techniques for baking...but if the time the cake is left in the oven is less than needed, what you get is a ""Half Baked Cake"",and this is exactly what this book is.The author wanted to get someting out qucik...so she quickly huddled up to get some information, and as it goes in the modern day media, thrown in some controversy, and chances are you may become a best seller...well this looks like a failed attempt to become a best seller.....its more a work for fiction than research, an academician or researcher is more honest and persistent in her approach...this is a failed attempt at gaining cheap popularity.Save yourself a few lattes and cappacinos...that would be a better you of your hard earned $$$...don't make this lazy author rich."
1,Not very good.,"I would have to agree with the person who described the book as ""lacking depth."" It is hard to follow what the author is trying to say, and her descriptions are one sided at best.Yet another conspiracy theoretician :("
5,Very honest book,"I think anyone that is looking for literature on Sahaja Yoga should read this book.It is a very unbiased study.Please note: its *not* an introductory book on Sahaja Yoga.The only drawback some may find - is by being so academic, it may come across at first rather heavy. But as you read and identify many of the Sahaja Yoga elements, customs and beliefs the book starts making perfect sense. Unlike many Sahaja Yoga literature out there.Judith Coner is a diplomatic master, the book never come across as offensive to people pro or against Sahaja Yoga. She observes, states her findings without once making a personal judgement of her own.Brilliant book really.Highly recommended."
4,Colorful reflections from the dark world of coal,"The beauty of this book lies in the fact that it does not attempt to analyze or comment upon. It simply presents the stories of ordinary men and women of this century in more or less their own words. All their lives in some way revolved around the dark world of Pennsylvania coal mining in the anthracite area of the Panther Valley. They are all refreshingly human, wonderfully straightforward, and tell deeply moving stories. Each in his or her own way reflects the rich cultural and ethical traditions brought here from European shores. The beauty of the book is its utter simplicity in approaching the mystery of the human personality against the backdrop of the drudgery of labor. It's a wonderful slice of life."
2,it work for 6 months,"It worked without any problems for 6 months, from one moment to another it completely stopped working and the screen turned off, now I have a pioneer and I have no problem"
4,Small fit. Effective but expensive and poor quality,"The sleep masks(I bought two) are well-padded so there is no pressure on the eyeballs and it is easy to breathe. They are effective at keeping light out. The fabric looks silky but the fluffy cotton backing quickly attracts dust and hair. Worst fault is the tie holding the mask on the head with velcro tabs. It is thin, unpleasant to touch and too small for most women (with hair). I shall have to insert extra material (or wear a scarf through the tie loops). The mocha colour is nondescript but the sage is okay. They are poorer quality than the sage and blue velvet, satin-backed, lavender-filled masks bought from this manufacturer in 2005. One mask was delivered by courier, the other took a month to arrive by post. This pack contained no spongy earphones."
3,"nice masks, shame they cost twice as much as they should have",Really good masks. BUT had to pay almost 20 quid import duty so they ended up being ridiculously expensive.
5,Great Show!,"I love this show! One of the better shows on TV I think! (The Walking Dead is the best though! ^_^)Came quick, in tact, and works... not much else to say about a DVD"
4,Top Notch,"Strong dialog throughout and characters that definitely grow on you. And, of course, some great gunplay. Here's a show that easily may end up watching 4 or 5 episodes at a time. Watch out."
5,BEST SERIES,We watched the TV series when it aired and were delighted to find we could purchase it. Plan to enjoy it many more times as well.
4,Fine Series,"The first season of ""Justified"" is like watching on TV without the commercial interruptions. I like it just fine because it has believeable and entertaining stories and plots. The main character, Raylan Givens, is a standup man who is honest, fearless, and honorable. He is a man of his word, and when he tells a man ""Stand right there and don't take another step"" he means what he says. There will be consequences! Of course, he makes poor decisions with women relations, but that makes him human. Good series!"
3,4 stars,I love the plot and actors. It would be 5 stars but the love to use gd.Other than that it is my favorite show.
3,Been waiting too long for the season.,We get tired of waiting so long for the disc. It does not come until the next season starts and I don't understand what is the difference when a person gets the disc. We love watching it and like owning the disc.
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR $,"Save your money and pass on this series. The show drastically falls short of expectations. The first episode was great and I really got pumped for the series, but concept and characters fall apart after that. It seems the lead character Olyphant can only play one type of character like he does in other roles from ""Deadwood"", ""The Crazies"" etc. The show really got ridiculous and after about 5 episodes I pretty much through in the towel. I really don't understand what the previous posts were watching, but I can assure you its not good TV. The DVD series is not worth having."
5,Great show!!,"This show is fantastic... funny, interesting, well acted. We watched seasons 1 and 2 in about a week (every night after work). I wasn't sure how I would like the show because I'm not a fan of ""westerns"" and that's what I was expecting, I was initially watching because I am a fan of Timothy Olophant (sic). I would recommend this to anyone who likes dry humor, great story lines and well defined characters. I'm looking forward to season 3 in March!"
5,Awesome show,"This is an awesome series. I highly reccommend that you watch this show. My husband is a huge fan. We just finished watching the third season on television, will buy that one too."
4,The Kentucky Visitors' Bureau can't like this series,"I don't want to visit Kentucky – especially the rural areas – because I know I'll be shot dead by either the local criminals or the Federal Marshall.Raylan Givens is a charming man, and I find myself enchanted by him and his shenanigans. Like my other favorite series, Breaking Bad, this is a show I have learned to enjoy no matter how despicable the characters are.I recommend it highly to anyone who enjoys a good ""Western"" in a modern setting."
3,courious,"I purchased this because people were talking about this program. So I wanted to see what the hype was about. I have to confess, I have not watched all of it, but it is okay."
4,Very Entertaining,A crime drama set in Kentucky. I wonder how people who live in Kentucky feel about this series. The main character is believable because he makes mistakes.
5,great!,Dear Amazon reduce the number of words from twenty here or don't expect many reviews from me. GReat show at a great price.
2,lame,"I'm from Kentucky and this is such an inaccurate show. Acting is horrible, plot is horriible. I can't believe people watch this but for each their own. Amazon was great, we just dont like this series."
5,Will watch more,"My brother-in-law insisted I watch the first episode - I did, and now I want to see more. Raylan is just too cool a character! But the most interesting part is the setting of Harlan, KY. I can't get a quote out of my head - He pulled first, it was Justified. I think I'm hooked."
5,AWESOME IS AN UNDERSTATMENT!,"This is a fun, exciting, modern western! Love the humor and wittiness. If you like shows with a western, down home country feel with a bit of hillbilly overtone this is a great series for you. My parents in their 70s-80s got a kick out of it, though it can be a bit racey in some episodes...they can't wait for the next season to come out...but I get to watch it first!"
3,Meh,A bit slow and underdeveloped. Olyphant is good but the other actors are only so-so. I've heard it gets better in Season Two and better again in Season Three.
5,Justified: The Complete First Season,"Totally addictive drama series with lots of twists...tons of violence...a look into the culture of eastern Kentucky and the coal mining communities, their drug trade and how they interact with ""outsiders""."
5,A Justified purchase.,"See the TV Guide Jan 21 thru 27 on the past and future of Justified now in Season 4. A dirty harry rural deputy United States Marshall with character flaws. Worse he has a psychotic father who is a serial killer. And like James Bond he can't control his libido. Season 3 was off the chain fantastic. Start with that and retrogress. Star Timothy Olyphant is also the producer. His motto is ""Don't give the people what they want,"" give the people what they don't know they want."" Based on a true life lawman in eastern Kentucky there has never been a cop show like this one. So in my opinion buying it is JUSTIFIED!"
5,One of the best shows on TV.,"It has drama, crime, sex, comedy and much more. Simply entertaining. Also Timothy Olyphant is easy on the eyes. I like his character and style."
5,GREAT SERIES. Terrible Streaming,I am very disappointed in Amazon streaming compared toNetflix. Will try not use Amazon streaming again. Bufferingis terrible and picture quality is hit or miss.
5,What a Great Series!,"I'm a Southerner so may be biased, but Raylan's character is the perfect hero. & Boyd is the best antagonist. (I've been a fan of Timothy Oliphant quite a while but Walton Coggins is new to me. & I'm enthralled.) The series has many,many great characters.Check it out! The product itself is brand new & was delivered as advertised."
4,Justified watching,"My husband and son really like this show. It is well-written and Timothy Oliphant is terribly cute, but it's also quite violent and has more explicit sex scenes than the regular networks (it is on FX after all)."
4,Sensational,"The actor who plays the main character is so much better than he was in Deadwood: a superb role in a superb series, great from the opening credits - and that music! - to the end. Also good to see another one of the great Elmore Leonard's stories make it to screen successfully, given the poor hit rate to date. I love the story the writers tell on the DVD special about the sign they have up in their room for when they get plot-stuck: ""What would Elmore do?"""
4,Justified Season1 BluRay,"The show is top notch with superb acting, writing and directing. This action series is sure to win many awards in various categories over its run. A must watch providing hours of pleasure for the serious drama enthusiast."
2,Wish I'd borrowed it.,"Wish Amazon had offered this first season or a few episodes free. Still a long wait list at the library, but I read and heard such rave reviews that I took a chance on this episode. Not impressed yet. Glad I didn't get on the library wait list."
1,$10 too much for HD,You're almost there Amazon. But not yet. Streaming should not be the same amount as a physical disk. Add that to there is no real queue for content...
1,blu ray version flawed,"I find the show intriguing. I would love to be able to see all episodes. Unfortunately, the blu ray of Justified can only be played once and then malfunctions to the point that it will not load. It just goes blank!"
5,May keep you up at night...,"watching episode after episode! I liked this so much, I couldn't stop watching. It's real gritty cops and robbers stuff, but better written, and better acting than most of the crap on TV these days. It is violent, there is some sexual content, it is not for ""sensitive viewers!"
4,Love it -- up to a point,"I'm a fan. I watched all the episodes available and found them to be witty, poignant, action-packed, and fun. But yeah, it's no Deadwood. It's no Dexter. It's no Breaking Bad. It's not teas-and-crumpet Downtown Abbey. But it's a much more accessible show and loads better than most of the crap on network TV. I thought about my dad while watching these. He would *love* Justified. Why? Because, as he would say, ""it's about a guy who shoots people and kills people."" It's about as close as you can get to the world of the gunslinger and still get that Elmore Leonard modern-day weirdness.Hooked.I would just like to be able to leave a review for all of these episodes at once, but the system does not allow it. Dang."
4,"I am in love with Timothy and I am from KY, go figure.","I own all three seasons for my Kindle and I am attempting to watch them over on my laptop, but the sync between voice and video is off especially on the pilot show. Amazon or Kindle please make a sync button like on the Kindle.Thanks.KateP.S. I am also a Hatfield and I am waiting for the Hatfields and McCoys to come out on video."
5,One of the best New Shows on TV!,"JUSTIFIED is one of the best new shows on TV, and I guess I like it so much because I live in the Southeastern part of Kentucky where the show takes place. Timmothy Oliphant and the rest of the cast are terrefic in this gritty show about Harland County, KY. I can't wait to get Season 2, and for Season 3 to air on TV. This 'un gets 5 ***** from me! I do have one question - why isn't London, KY ever mentionedl, especially since their is a Federal Court House and U. S. Marshall's Office here? LOL!"
5,If you are a Justified junkie..,"A must have if a newbee needs to understand the back story or a Tim Olyphant junkie! Yes, I would recommend this product."
4,Justified,The language was terrible and the violence got pretty bad too. but loved the story since I am from the South and live close to where things like this happened years ago.
3,Little Displeased,"Watched Timothy Olyphant on Deadwood. Really liked him. So after reading the reviews I decided to watch Justified. Wasn't free anywhere so bought season 1 from Amazon. Glad I didn't pay for the HD season. Story line just doesn't keep my interest. And rated ""mature"", can't see why, not even much bad language. Just plain let down on this show."
3,"Great pilot, mediocre episodes.","compared to the season that followed, this season (with the exception of the pilot which is great) seem like a typical cop show from the 80s. Season two was far superior to it and Season 3."
5,Fresh and different,"I liked the new story and thought the writing was good, the acting even better. Looked forward to season two,"
5,Well worth the price,"This is an excellent first season of a superlative TV show. The extra features are especially interesting: a fascinating interview with Elmore Leonard who wrote the short story on which the show is based and the show's writers as well as four episodes with informative commentary--see especially the commentary about Episode 8 - Blowback. If ""Justified"" continues to excel as it has so far this season, comparisons to ""The Wire"" and ""Deadwood"" and ""The Sopranos"" will not be overstatements."
5,Justified season one,I started watching this series in the middle of the second season.I enjoyed it so much that I had to order the first season. It is a very interesting show and liked seeing the first season.
5,Justified,"I bought this for my husband because he really liked the series. Timothy Olyphant is so charismatic along with a few characters on the other side of the feuding family, especially the mother! The story keeps me wanting more, can't wait to get the next season!"
5,I'm totally hooked,"When my husband started watching this show I laughed, thinking it would be like Walker, Texas Ranger. Then when he bought the blue ray I decided to watch the first episode with him and I was totally hooked. This show is great! I'm so excited the new season has started."
5,great show,I absolutely love this show. I look forward to the next season and will purchase it when it is put out. I hope it is on for a very long time. Timothy Olyphant is great in this roll.
4,Love the show...period.,"First, I am not a fan of these kinds of shows. I thought it was just gonna be like a southern version of today's crappy crime dramas, but I was wrong. I was hooked on this show from the very beginning. To this day I haven't missed an episode and barring a premature apocolypse-lol-I don't plan to. If you're tired of the terrible run-down dramas on TV today, give this a try. Olyphant gives it a little comedic twist. Imagine Gregory House with a badge if you will."
5,Justified Season 1,With our Roku we have been able to catch up on one of our favorite shows. I would recommend it.
5,All my favorite things,"Tish is a great show, starring the main actor from the movie ""the crazies"". the whole show is based in Kentucky so its pretty fun to see him have to deal with all the hillbillies out there. good blend of CSI, Texas Ranger and Breaking Bad"
5,Glad I ordered it,"I now own or will soon own all three seasons. Finishing up on Season 2 and just ordered Season 3. Item received in excellent condition and on time. Thank you,"
4,Great start,"Excellent start, (I've seen 4 shows) unusually enough for me, I quite like the Hip Hop/Country song that is the shows theme song. I always had a penchant for Elmore Leonard's work, his criminals, bad girls and almost good men.This, allegedly is based on 'Fire in the hole', but it seems to me the main character is taken whole from ""The Hot Kid"".Beginning to wonder if the writing will allow it to stretch its legs, but the players are doing their best, so we'll see.brendan"
5,More Raylan please..!,"We have watched every episode and want more. Timothy Olyphant is great, the cast is perfect. Please give us a due date on the release of Season 1, I want it for Christmas gifts."
4,Good DVD,"I mainly watch movies and I tend not to watch TV shows, the low budgets and the pressure to churn out episodes on a weekly basis make them pretty weak in my mind, but this is a very good TV series. I like it mainly due to Timothly Olyphant, who I think is a great actor, but the show is very good also, especially the opening sequence with the Miami gunfight. How original! And the event isn't forgotten about and never mentioned, as so many TV shows do, acting like everything that has come before it never happened -- it constantly comes back to affect situations, just like real life. The DVD has good extras and background on the show, which also makes it a good buy. The show probably won't get any better than this first season, since TV series tend to milk their ideas pretty quickly then run out of them, so get this and enjoy it, especially if you, like our family, can't get enough of Timothy."
5,Justified - the TV series on FX,"We are huge fans of the star, Tim Oliphant, (same actor who did Dead Wood). I had seen the entire season on TV and bought this as a gift.Highly recommend this collection and the seller - good price, fast service!AMAZON VERIFIED PURCHASE!"
2,Poor Transfer,"This is the worst transfer I have ever seen, it keeps going in and out of focus.We should all return our copies...maybe the powers that be would notice then.Great show, crappy DVDs"
4,Good old-fashioned story telling,"I'd heard a lot about the show so I tried it out and was impressed. Solid story-telling without leaning on gimmicks and a fabulous cast headed by the amazing Timothy Olyphant. My only 'beef' is the stereotypical southern meme of Southern life. As a recent transplant from the West Coast, I have never met a warmer, shoulder-to-shoulder-in-hard-times populace. So it's tiring to see clueless rednecks and Nazi skinheads as Southern-style characters. Those types are in every state, but more often than not, here you'll find someone willing to give you the shirt of his back, regardless of race or religion."
3,where is this going?,"After reading several reviews, and being a fan of Elmor Leanord, I bought the first season on DVD. Initially, the story held up, great characters, great acting. But perhaps this show is too much like its slow and easy deep south location for my taste. Season 1 left me with no real desire to continue on to 2, not sure I care about these characters or the repetitive and turtle-paced story line enough to spend more time with it (and I typically am drawn to character driven stories). Might be my Yankee tastes, if you are in to southern culture (on the skids) then you'll probably like this show enough to keep watching."
5,Great show,Great series. The cast is phenomenal and Olyphant plays so well against Goggins its almost like you forget you're watching tv. Some salty language but overall its nothing too bad. Highly enjoyable show with great acting. Lots of action and lots of fun.
1,Help!,"I'm sorry to deliver the low star rating--particularly because I love the show--but the video quality of these DVDs is quite dreadful. Has anyone else had this problem? The focus fades in and out (no, it's not a camera or cinematographic issue), the screen is frequently pixellated, colors are muddy. It's *because* I love the show that these discs are so terribly disappointing.So I ask: is this a common problem? All of my other DVDs play fine. Please let me know if you have had such difficulties, and I'll start a letter-writing campaign to Sony Pictures for producing discs of such low video quality. Or perhaps this is their nefarious scheme to force everyone into the overpriced blu-ray mode?Thank you."
4,....this show improved,I was really looking forward to this series.There were a few early weaker episodes and then it got serious...better and I looked forward to this somewhat quirky series. Olyphant is an interesting actor as he sure proved in Deadwood.I tend to like gritty.If you like gritty look out for the 6PT BBC police crime psychological thriller...LUTHER.
2,Didn't make it past the pilot,"I thought this looked like an interesting series, but we didn't make it past the pilot. Bad acting, hokey dialogue and just plain cheesy and so unrealistic. It seemed like really lazy writing, seen-it-all-before type of stuff."
1,DUMB DUMB DUMB,"Is anyone else bothered by the inanity of this episode? Too bad--I was starting to like this series.My gripe? You have a sheriff that needs to kill our hero. Simple. That's what he needs to do. What he REALLY needs to do (or the Miami bad guys will, ostensibly, kill him).Now...the hero does not know that the sheriff needs to kill him. Almost everyone in town still thinks this sheriff is a good guy. So what does the sheriff do? Turn on our hero when the two are alone--so the sheriff is in little danger of getting caught?NO! The sheriff burns every bridge in his life by kidnapping the damsel in distress in order to lure our hero to a location where...where...the sheriff finally addresses his need and kills our hero, right? Of course not! The sheriff has our hero DRIVE him to...to...oh...never mind...what difference does it make...This was one hell of a stupid episode.A big thanks to the show runner who thinks we are all idiots.Bravo!"
5,Favorite New Show,"This show is amazing. The main character is brilliant. The show is very well written and the acting is superb. It's a little too violent for me, but it is incredibly realistic. I love Justified."
3,Its ok,Don't kow if I would pay anymore to watch this. Would watch it if it was free maybe. Seems to be a popular show perhaps I should try it again.
5,Great Show,"This show is one of the better series I have seen in the last while. I enjoy getting into a show a few seasons into its run so there are a good number of episodes/seasons to watch consecutively without having to wait a week between shows. After the first couple episodes I was unable to stop watching. The characters are great and engrossing. I like the way each episode has its own subplot that is resolved within the 40 or so minutes while there are always larger plots playing out over the course of the entire season. Overall one of the better shows out right now. Now that I have watched and caught up to season 4 it is hard to wait that week to see what will happen next.Also recommend: Walking Dead, Dexter, True Blood, Game of Thrones, Sons of Anarchy."
3,An excelent series,The show the complexity of the lives of those who are poor and those who have money. Olyphant fits this part like a glove even though it is hard to understand how he can draw so fast from a seated position with his coat covering his holster. But he sells the part and makes the show.
4,"Great entertainment, addictive, leaves you wanting more.",This type of modern crime entertainment is the kind that tickles you while it leaves you a little uncomfortable. Reminiscent of the early Clint Eastwood movies but with a little twist... Timothy Olyphant makes you want to help him straighten his twisted mind out. You root for him even while he offends you. Overall it is the series that gets you hooked and you can't wait for the next episode.
5,Justified,Good story line. Characters are all accomplished actors. Mostly I enjoy watching the episodeswithout the commercials. I can watch it on tv but prefer to view it at my leisure.
5,It's okay.,"Bang. Bang bang. Bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang. Bang.Dry-wit gunslinger Raylan Givens shoots a lot of rednecks. And, occasionally, solves a crime. But mostly shoots the hillfolk of Kentucky.It's kind of great.Bang."
3,Starts off well but ends up fizzling out,"I got through the first two discs just fine. Interesting characters, decent storytelling, with a few good laughs but at the point where Boyd(Walter Goggins) gets out of prison, the show just completely loses its momentum. I nearly fell asleep during the finale! Needless to say I won't be bothering with season 2."
4,Pretty good CD,"I liked the CD overall. The background music is decent, although the background singers in Grease are quite amateur, not to mention annoying. Words are provided, but that aren't always accurate. Still, I would highly recommend it to serious Broadway singers. It's better than most other CDs I have heard."
3,Mislabled,"Anyone expecting ""Matchmaker"" on this c.d., as I was, will be sorely disappointed. The track listing is mislabeled on this website and there seems to be no way to correct it. The actual #12 track is ""What I Did For Love"" from A Chorus Line. Other than that, the c.d. appears to be in good order."
3,Dead Woman Walking,"Yes, released on the heels of Dead Man Walking, it suffered in comparison. But it does have strong performances by Sharon Stone and Rob Morrow. Other good actors grace the cast list too. It's nice to see Chicago Hope alum Jayne Brook in something else--wish she'd had more to do. Randy Quaid and Peter Gallagher could have been used to better effect. The gender switch makes the prison movie cliches a bit more tolerable."
5,Last dance,"I was very happy with my movie, since it's kinder old i did't think i could find it, but amazon had it. Thank you."
3,It Was Done Better Elsewhere.,"Trying to save a convicted person from execution as time runs out is an inherently dramatic situation, and that is the basic plot of this film. However, having previously seen ""I Want To Live"" with Susan Hayward's academy award winning performance as convicted murderess Barbara Graham, and ""Dead Man Walking,"" with Susan Sarandon and Sean Penn, I found this film's plot to be a predictable rehash of these others. Even the dramatic last minute reprieve of Sharon Stone before her final execution shortly afterward was also done in ""I Want to Live."" Nor did the performances of the players seem to come across as compellingly as those in the two films mentioned.The film should appeal primarily to those who have an intense interest in issues touching on the death penalty and, in particular, in its application."
2,light on content,"I guess you get what you pay for, but I was surprised at how little there was useful in the book beyond the absolute basics. There's really nothing on mic selection or placement. The most useful stuff is some nice breakdown of EQ ranges, which takes up a few pages."
1,Very basic stuff,"You'll find only basic but VERY basic stuff... nothing you could learn by yourself or some guy that work not even in a studio but in his own home-studio. I didn't read any information I found before on Internet for free. But if you like, there are some drawings..."
1,"Wrong, Wrong, Wrong","The first time I ordered this item, I was sent the wrong filters. The picture shown is the one I wanted, but not what I received. I returned the items through a Call Tag, meaning that the company paid for the return. Along with the return I sent them an actual photo of the correct filter. They, in turn, sent the wrong filters, AGAIN. Only this time they sent four of them instead of two. I contacted the company by phone and was told that apparently they did not have the filters I needed. Why was I not told that through an email or by phone. They had my phone number. I will never order anything from this company again. Very poor customer service!!!!!!"
2,can't see the words,this one runs the words over each so much that you can't see much of them at all. i would not suggest anyone buy this one because of this.
2,sing along without pitch,"I'm new to karaoke, so maybe this is how it's done, but the tunes did not have the melody lines, only background music. almost impossible to sing along to for the amateur enthusiast"
4,Party Tyme always good.,"It is a good addition to my collection of songs to sing at karaoke.I could not sing a lot of the songs, but it is good having in my collection."
4,The quality of this product was very good.,"I have really enjoyed this karaoke CD, it is the first one I have purchased. I really love to sing and share music with others. I performed two of the songs on this CD at the bowling alley near where I live, and a gentleman who has his own variety show on a cable access channel in Charlotte, NC was there and heard me perform. He invited me to appear on the show in April. So I am very glad I got this CD and will enjoy using it again and again."
4,"Good, but not what I expected","While on my journey for good electronica that is similar to the prodigy, I have been recommended various Chemical Brothers cd's by many people. So I decided to pick up their latest album at the music store. While very good, it is not what I expected. If you've heard prodigy before, and you can't get enough of it, look elsewhere. You won't find energetic beats, fat basslines, or hip-hop-ish lyrics here. This is the type of music one would listen to while driving, chilling out, or reading. It tells a story and after the CD is over there is a sense of completeness.So, in closing, this is not techno, or at least, not the techno I'm use to."
3,Strange...,"This Chemical's cd is very strange, and sometimes a bit slow. Come with us, the track, really rocks, but Come with us, the album, just don't delivers. I'm not going with them, after all..."

4,Well done.,"A lot of the songs we're really good; some of my favorites are It Began In Afrika, Star Guitar, and Denmark. However, I was a little disappointed with Hoops and Pioneer Skies. It is still an excellent buy. The cover is neat too."
4,Totally Chemical Brothers !,"Indeed this record is totally what you would expect from The Chemical Brothers. Good thing or bad some people have asked themselves before me...Well my 2 cents is that it is a good thing. Although the Chemical Brothers are no pioneers in dance music they have that something different to their sound, an unexplicable ""extra"" which makes every album into a cracking solid i-can't-stand-still sound... Perhaps this lack of inventiveness comes because the Chemical brothers don't really have to put a lot of effort into making a fun and good album. Or to say it in other words...they just ""do their thing"", and that's all we'll ever ask..."
5,WOW!,"This is a real gem.However, you must play it loud and often to get the full effect (much to your neighbor's chagrin)."
3,Definitly not the album to judge them by,"This is probably the worst Chemical Brothers album yet. I don't know what happened here but I wouldn't give up on them yet. The songs that are good are really good, and the ones that are bad, are pretty bad. There are only 2-3 songs that fall in between. Here is my track rating (1-5):#1: 4#2: 5#3: 1#4: 3#5: 2.5#6: 4#7: 2#8: 5#9: 3.5#10: 1"
3,Try Dig Your Own Hole first,"This album is good, and what you would expect from the Chemical Brothers. I'm still trying to decide if that is a good or bad thing. There are some great standout tracks here, like ""Star Guitar"", ""Galaxy Bounce"" (from the Tomb Raider Soundtrack), and ""It Began in Afrika""... but the beats get a little repetitive and long on the album. It just doenst keep my attention as well as Dig your own hole or Exit Planet Dust did. I dont know... well its a solid CD and a must have for any fan, but i still think Crystal Method's Tweekend or Basement Jaxx's Rooty are superior. If you are just now getting into the Chemical Brothers, Dig your own hole is their classic, and it forever will be. It seems they have gone downhill on this one... there seems to be alot of fillers. anyway, its still good for a couple of songs. this is basically a just-for-fans album."
3,Dissapointed -- I'm not coming with you...!,"I have two other CB albums and eagerly anticipated their next. But i was pretty disappointed with their effort here. The CD comes off as being a little too repetitive and not nearly as engaging as some of their other work. There are a few songs that are worth listening to but as a whole, it's not nearly as strong as Surrender in my humble opinion. It didn't make my cd rotation..."
2,New but not revolutionary....,"Maybe I'm outgrowing The Chemical Brothers, but I don't find the same ""Oh my gosh!"" beats and sounds with this album as I have with previous ones. ""Star Guitar"" is one of the finest Brothers tracks ever, and it really carries this album. Maybe I was spoiled to hear The White Label remix of ""It began in Afrika"" before the album, because the album version is a disappointment comparitively. ""Galaxy Bounce"" and ""The Test"" bring the album to a level that may make it worth the purchase, but I'm not sure $14 is worth it."
3,Pretty smooth,"The title track, Come with Us is amazing, the drum rolls keep building, there are 2 other excellent tracks too, but the title track is well worth buying the cd."
3,when did the chemical brothers get so generic?,"it's been a steady slide downhill from ""exit planet dust"", if you ask me. they've gotten progressively into the bland world of electronica and sound like some terrible trance knock-off rather than kings of big beat. those first few years, i was sure the chems could do no wrong. after listening to ""surrender"" and now ""come with us"", i'm not sure they can do anything right."
3,Where are those breakbeats?,"The Chemicals new album is a total departure for them. Gone are those awesome sampled breakbeats, in place are cookie cutter dance beats a la Daft Punk. Also gone are those rock and funk samples replaced with warped out electronic sounds. For the most part if the cd wasn't labeled, I don't think I'd be able to guess it was the Chemicals! Now, with all this change it doesn't necessarily make this a bad album, quite opposite actually. It's quite good, just a huge departure from their old sound. I'd say if you enjoyed Galaxy Bounce from the Tomb Raider Soundtrack then for the most part you will like this album. Beth Orton makes a come back and brit pop boy Ashcroft from the defunct The Verve."
2,Melodies would have helped. A lot.,"I've got every Chemical Brothers release and have been a big fan for years, but this CD is my least favorite by a long shot. Bummer. Uncharacteristic of their other stuff, this disc - to me - just seems to lack anything resembling melody, and instead ventures into repetitive, techno-trance house beats that drag on and on and on. I dunno. Maybe I just don't get it. I'd recommend listening to the previews before buying, even if you're a buy-without-listening fan, like I am (or was)."
1,What a waste!,"How can this album be on top of the electronica charts when it's so terrible!? Their current single ""Star Guitar"" is one of the only few good cuts on the whole thing. This album is not for electronica fans that love fierce instrumentation, it's for people that just like noise. This album is so ""eclectic"" that it becomes a chore to listen all the way through. Electronica is in a sad state when this CD is flying off the racks; and unfortunately, I am one of the poor fools that made this rubbish a success."
4,Come With the Chems,"This latest offering by the Chemical Brothers is another great, sonic excursion. This one will not ""set the trap"" as quickly as say, ""Surrender"" and requires numerous listens to gain a true appreciation. The Brothers Chemical produce an electronica of exposition. It takes time and effort to appreciate the amazing layering of sound chemicals and this is especially true in ""Come with Us."" If you are a Chem fan, of course you'll get it. If you are just beginning to experiment with the Chemicals, I would say, ""Exit Planet Dust"" and ""Surrender"" would be the best entry sequence. I believe this album indeed explores some new areas- albeit subtle ones. ""Star Guitar"" is a brilliant one!"
2,pretty weak...,The Chemical Brothers must be in that rare group of people who like the direction Radiohead has gone recently. Better luck next album.
1,"So much hype, but not so good.","They have been praised for their music alot, and i admit some stuff in the past have been real good but this Cd is a bore. Most songs sound the same, some nice beats on certain songs but not so much moore. This is more easy listening music then chart music or even music you can dance too. There are only 10 songs on the Cd and many are slow and dull, then you'll realize it's not worth the money... ""My Elastic Eye"" is a little diffrent though, it's faster and rougher. On ""the test"" they sing a little, actally the only song with some vocals. ""Star Guitar is the best however, but it's like most other songs a very long one, over 6 minutes and if you've heard 30 seconds of it it's gonna be the same for the rest of the song. A waste of money as i see it, don't bother."
1,Sad,"Perhaps it's the end of an era. The orb's last album was [not good], underworld ended on a pretty mediocre note, and Norman Cook looks set to do more collaborations with that awful Macey Grey woman. Now the Chemical Brothers finally let me down. I have fallen in love with all their past albums, but this one is a big disappointment. Hopefully they're just stuck in a rut... Back to the album: Where it's dancey, it's formulaic and boring. Where it tries for psychedelia, it's noodley and kind've annoying. Overall it sounds like it was made by some skilled but uninspired Chemical Bros imitators. One star may be a little harsh, but I expected so much. Oh Arse."
5,Classic Mouse,The Mouse & the man is another album in which EEK-A-MOUSE displays his signature style and Roots Reggae Rhythms. Great album.
2,This CD really gives me a good laugh,"All the songs sound the same. And that is what is so funny about it and that's also the reason I do not rate it 1 star. If you want quality reggae, then you should listen to Beef, Bob Marley, Johnny Nash or Jimmy Cliff.But I must say that I am not quickly satisfied. You really must not listen to this CD after you have listened to Gentle Giant's ""Acquiring the taste""..."
5,toilet flush tank lever,"This is the perfect addition to my new bathroom...exactly what i wanted, easyto install, directions were perfect...looks great too!! very happy with this product!"
3,Good looks but bad fit.,I love the way this looks on my toilet but I had to go to Home Depot to get extra pieces to make this actually fit on my toilet. Our toilet is new and in a new construction home so I assumed the handle would fit since there is nothing fancy or customized about the toilet but it did not. It stuck out way too far and I had to buy spacers to put on the inside of the tank and even with that I have to hand tighten the handle once a day or so by about 3/4 of a turn. Looks awesome but fits not so awesome :(
4,My second purchase of this music,"I wore my first copy out so I ordered another. The music is moody and evocative, rhythmic and exotic. I love it."
1,This isn't trance-techno,"If you are looking for trance techno, don't buy this CD. If you like lots of vocals, very slow beats, and lots of people singing in foreign languages, then you will dig the heck out of this CD. If you are looking for trance techno style then you will feel like you got ripped off, like me."
4,Flawless performances.,Intimate and intense French drama details the painful dissolution of a relationship. Superb and mature performances make this movie highly appealing for french movies fans. It is a slow exploration of a family break-up when Anne told Pierre that she is seeing another man. Fans of Huppert and Auteuil will not miss this movie. The end is of course depressing.
4,par for the course,"If memory serves me right this was the first of the John Renbourn Group recordings, from back in the mid 1970s. The band (which included Pentangle vocalist Jacqui McShee) sounded a bit like Renbourn's previous group Pentangle, but was less improvisational, more tightly wound, and less catholic in its choice of material (mostly folksongs, or songs that could be given a folksy spin). Actually, to my ears the group sound they produced sometimes verged on the over-wound, energetic but lacking spontaneity. Still, it's hard to complain about the level of musicianship and professionalism displayed."
3,Flash magic is magical,"I purchased these for my children (they are only 4) to learn how to add. First, I separated the two digit #'s from the single digit #'s for children who are just learning their numbers. I used their crayons or something which they can count out the first #, then count out the second #, then count them all for the answer. I think it's a great early learning tool. They are now on two digit #'s and they are getting better the more they use this product. I recommend it for children who know their numbers. I can't wait for the subtraction cards to become available.Thanks!"
3,good for college bull sessions,"24 short (1-3 page) treatments of various paradoxes. The main problem with this book is the unequal quality from one description to another. My best guess as to the target audience would be under graduate philosophy students.'Gould, Escher and Bach' is a better book for those interested in paradoxes."
2,So long So Long Stemless,"I thought this glass would be of better quality than it is. It took 3 shipments (re cieved and returned) to get my complete order without any breakage. These glasses are too fragile and in practice, impractical. Because of the design, one must live with fingerprints all over the body of the glass. Not too appealing when you are observing the ""legs"" of your wine.Recommend that you pass these by."
2,Stemless wine glasses,"The price is right, but these stemless wineglasses are so lightweight that one of them broke in my daughter's hand. I was surprised at their thinness since they are made by a company that makes glass coffee and tea pots."
2,Form over Function,"Yes, I love these wine glasses for their look and their feel and their aesthetics, but all that is for naught because yes, they break way too easily. Just said goodbye to my last one out of four. I already knew they were delicate when I bought them and so I took extra care handwashing them, yet I still lost two to washing. The other two broke when barely bumped against another glass. At their low price, I'm still tempted to buy more, but I cannot. It's just bad design and I don't want to reward bad design. Read the reviews. We are not clumsy people, lol. Yours will break too."
1,So fragile all my sets are broken after 2 month.,"I got a set of 8 a few months ago. First one package arrived with a broken one, then all of them ended up broken. They break if you fill them with water and try to take them by the side. they break if you set them a little too fast on the table. One of them broke by just holding it. Such poor quality I am extremely disapointed. But I loved the design though."
2,beautiful but breakable,"these are really beautiful glasses, and incredibly light. we have no dishwashwer, though, and i broke one the first time i washed it (putting the dishsponge down inside) - and i was being careful. these are really, really delicate. my husband broke one the next day. we also got the white wine version of these glasses, and one was broken upon arrival - still wrapped in its bubble wrap. i have no idea why bodum decided to make these of such incredibly thin glass. they're really beautiful, and we love using them, but it's ridiculous to have to be this careful with them - i mean, we have other wine glasses that i used to think were delicate, but these bodum ones take the cake. we also bought the double-walled bodum glasses, and those are beautiful and much sturdier (although they're not for wine.....)"
3,Look nice...won't last long!,"As other reviewers have noted, these glasses are extremely delicate. I fear they will break with only a slight squeeze. But for the price they're hard to beat."
2,It's made in China,"The saw arrived from China, via Oregon, looking like it had already seen a few weeks at work. Oh yeah, the sole plate is bent too. I'd return it, but if I combine the ""restocking fee"", return shipping, and original shipping fee, I'd be paying a hundred bucks just to carry it back to the post office."
1,The 13-amp MAG is made in China too!,"I foolishly bought the 13-amp MAG saw from an outside Amazon-associated vendor, in the belief that this was one of the older 13-amp models made in the US before Skil outsourced manufacturing to China and upped the amperage from 13 to 15. Imagine my surprise when I opened the shipping box to find that this 13-amp MAG-77 was made in China as well! I've returned the saw to the seller and I'll be shopping around for a used US-built model."
5,Best of the Worm Drives,"I bought my Skill HD77 in 1978. Still runs great. I have contracted on and off for years. Have built numerous additions, Sun Decks, Garages, Foundations, Remodeled Bathrooms, Kitchens and Choped in Sky Lights and windows. I wouldn't have any other type of saw. I've done some things not recomended like making it into a temporary table saw (worked good). Now after 31 years it's a little worn out. Gives you a shock once in a while now, but still works fantastic. I can say this saw has quite literally put food on my table for years. It has NEVER let me down. It's worth every penny."
5,Saw for a lifetime,I've used this saw for year in every possible environment and in ways never intended by the manufacturer. It never let me down. I'm always surprised when I see an ancient Skill wormdrive at a pawn or used tool shop. I guess the old owner didn't have kids. As long as you keep it lubed it 'll be working for your grand kids.
4,Wonderful tour of Smetana's music and the Czech countryside,For years I have been trying to find a recording of the Moldau (Vltava) which I fell in love with as a teenager. I found this CD recently with a special sale price in a local store. I was delighted that it was presented by an Eastern European Symphony -- we don't hear much of them in the west -- and I hoped they would have a special feeling for Smetana's vibrant romance with his Czech homeland. They do and they capture all of his wonderful sense of melody and flow. The other musical poems in the set were new to me. It was nice to finally have the context for the Moldau that Smetana intended.
5,An Excellent Diagnostic Guidebook,"This book is not a repair manual. It is a compendium of common problems and their solutions for MGB owners. It is really well written guidebook helping one to figure out what is causing that rattle, knock or whine somewhere on the MGB. There is a mountain of useful advice and diagnosis, but don't expect this book to tell you how to fix the problem step by step. For that you need a workshop manual, but on the other hand, a workshop manual will not help you very much to find the problem. That is why this book is a gem and a must buy for any non-expert MGB owner/mechanic. I can't wait for more books in this series to be published for other vintage British sports cars."
5,The book paid for itself within the first week!,"I went online to check out recommended books on MGB's. This was ""THE"" one that was preferred for general maintenance. I changed out the fuel filter on my car and it wouldn't start. Local repair shops didn't even want to look at it even though I suspected debris from the filter plugging the carb. This book told me EXACTLY how to fix it! It probably saved me a few hundred dollars right there!Well worth the investment!!"
2,Poor Image Quality Ruins Book's One Attribute,"Aspen Pittman, whom I have met and talked to at several industry conventions such as NAMM and AES, is not a highly technical individual: in fact I doubt he even understands basic electronics. His book is therefore a compilation of a lot of schematics and (on Fenders) parts layouts for guitar amplifiers, and a few articles written by various tech writers, some of which are of merit and some of which aren't.The schematics are not very legible and many contain known errors. For this price, he could at least get that part right. I don't recommend this book unless you cannot find a needed schematic or layout anywhere else."
4,"The Tube Amp Book - Good, but not a DIY guide","I am building a 50 watt tube amp based off of Marshall & Fender designs; somewhat of a hybrid. I bought this for the schematics and such. The book is more of a history of tube amps, info on the parts/tubes & schematics, but it is not a DIY book. If you do not know what you are doing and you want to build your own amp, this book will not be a help. If you already know how to build one and need schematics and would also like to know the history of amps and the parts, this is good book for that. Also as stated in previous reviews, the schematics can be very hard to read, some are handwritten or bad copies, but with some work, can be read."
3,Good to have in your tube amp library as a resource,"Pittman's book gives good exposure to the history, theory and some troubleshooting techniques. So it's part coffee table picture book, part text book and gives some approaches to amp repair. The pictures are decent and can give you a serious itch of gear acquisition syndrome (aka ""gas""). The technical data is obvious geared towards Groove Tubes but applies to common tube principles. The troubleshooting part will help a newbie get the hang of working on amps. So I recommend it as part of your tube amp library as it gives good exposure and will lead you to towards greater tube amp knowledge."
3,Good Book but...,"This book has to be on the bookshelf of every electric guitarist. But I am sitll giving it only 3 stars because the title of the book is VERY MISLEADING. This book is not about ""tube amps"" it is about tube ""guitar"" amps. For anyone looking for historical, pictorial collection type of book about guitar amps then this is it. I liked the technical section of this book where the author talks about popular tube types used in GAs and there are also tube characteristics and curves! Also schematics which may or may not be useful to anyone.So if you think this book is about ""tube amps"" and will teach you tube theory and even how to build one then you will be thouroughly disappointed - like me."
5,The ultimate tube amp book,"A very extensive biography of all the amps I've ever seen or heard of, & a ton of amps I haven't. Schematics, wiring diagrams, parts lists for modifications & upgrades, tube reference section & much, much more. A must for any serious musician."
5,Great book covering the history of amps.,This is a great book for anyone interested in the history of guitar tube amplifiers. Its especially great for the hobbyist tube amp builders because it contains 801 schematics on the CD that comes with the book. This book is the follow up of Aspen Pittman's book the Tube Amp Book 4.1th edition and 4th addition as well. This book is smaller than the previous editions because a lot of the schematics have been put on the CD-ROM that comes with the book. But more schematics have been released with this edition on the CD-ROM so it actually contains more info than the previous editions. The CD-ROM contains 801 schematics of vintage amps. All of them are in PDF format and viewable on any machine that can run Adobe Acrobat. The pictures and descriptions in the book give you a great idea of how the vintage amps looked and how they evolved. This book is a must have for any tube amp afficianado.
1,Not what you think!,"I thought this book would give 100 Best US Wedding 'Destinations' instead you get 100 Best Wedding 'Venues'....there's a big difference in the two! A destination is a city/state...NOT an actual venue/reception location. Also NO pictures at except for the photo essay in the beginning that includes just 14 photos. I wonder if the places in the book paid for to be listed as they are not the best, as I perceive, places for a venue.Save your money on this one!"
4,Wedding Destinations is just that,"I own a info website and thought that this book would be useful for assisting in the reviews and generating ideas. It did just that, although some of the desinations seemed to mundane."
4,Moving fusion,"This is an evocative blend of classical Indian music and western harmonies. Ali Akbar Khan creates magic with the liquid sound of the sarod, and his fellow musicians do a great job rounding out his ideas with western-style violin and wind accompaniments. The general effect is relaxed, not excited. The pieces are rhythmic and emotional, and range from playful north Indian folksong to classical ""khayaal"" to blues. As east-west fusions go, this is definitely among the most successful."
4,Well done,"I really enjoyed this book as it was the first I had read from Henry the VIII's perspective. It was well written, interesting, and an easy read. Lots of fun for the Tudor-phile."
1,not very good,"It's not very good. Ms. George does, however, succeed in portraying Henry VIII-one of the most fascinating men to ever live-as a one dimensional soap opera figure. The interludes of Will Somers are very disjointed and inappropriate. If you want an excellent read, try The Great Harry by Carolly Erickson. Don't waste your time on this"
1,"Well, its okay, but it leaves something to be desired...","It could have been better... A real disapointment, especially after I read George's PHENOMINAL Memoirs of Cleopatra. A real LETDOWN!!!! :^("
5,An usurpassable piece of literature!,"This was the best book I have ever read! For someone who is really interested in Henry VIII and his colorful wives, this is it. I only hope Ms. George writes more books about the people of theat era, especially the third Duke of Norfolk."
4,great historical fiction,"This is not my usual read. I decided to give it a whirl and was pleasantly surprised. The narrator is Henry VIII's jester Will Somer's, and he shows us Henry as a boy, youth and man. It cleverly contains a massive amount of historical information yet reads well. Great if you love historical fiction and in my view much better read than the phillipa gregory novels surrounding this monarch.if you loved the tudor tv series you'll enjoy this."
3,Everyone seems to love this book but...,"This is a great read. Margaret George has done a fabulous job of spinning a historically based novel,which is great as long as it doesn't get mistaken for real history. Although she gets only a few actual facts wrong,(most notably, she thinks that thee/thou is the formal pronoun)she falls into the trap of showing Henry and his wives as their most extreme traditional sterotypes.If you're interested in reading about Henry VII as something other than the sex and food obsessed buffoon he is commonly depicted as, try reading Jasper Ridley's penetrating and fascinating biography of this remarkable king."
4,Interesting perspective,"I really enjoyed this book, in that it gave a new perspective not only to Henry VIII, but also the beginnings of separation of church and state. Very well written as well."
4,O.K.,"This certainly was a different take on Henry VIII-- from his point of view. It was interesting to read a somewhat nicer account of this dreadful man for a change. I am not sure that this book needed to be so long, it dragged on in parts and seems like it could have been tied up and ended much sooner. After reading this book I am exhausted about the idea of reading much else about Henry VIII's life. If history is to be believed, he was a horrid creature, period."
3,Somewhat disappointing,"I am an avid reader of anything Tudor related and as a result have become a well versed amateur in all things Henry VIII and his wives. I found this book very interesting as it was the first one featuring Will Somers as well as written from Henry's perspective. I learned a few new facts and was able to see him from a more humane point of view. However, I felt the ending was very rushed. Henry spent a great time covering the first two wives and young Kitty but not the other wives. As well, it was completely inaccurate on Bessie Blount and Mary Boleyn, his two mistresses. Although they had spent a great deal of time with him, they were only covered for less than a paragraph. Both had children by him but the book completely neglects that fact as well as the fact that Mary Boleyn was married during a part of her affair with the king. The rushed ending and inaccurate portrait of the women aside, it was a good read."
4,my review,"This is the third book I have read from Margaret George. I am still very much impressed by the way her narrator, and main character make the book seem so real and so easy to read. I have studied and read a lot about the life of Henry VIII, but this is the first time I can feel as if I know him. To add the notes from his fool, only makes the story more real and believable. Being a great lover of historical novels, I can only say: Great Work and please keep it up!"
5,Engrossing,I ripped through this book in just a few days. It was very hard for me to put down! George made Henry seem like a real person and not a two dimensional character.
3,Not bad but strangely biased,"I started reading this book to get another opinion of Henry VIII. I have been a Tudor buff for many years. I was dissapointed by how weak the Henry character is depicted. Henry was by all accounts a strong man who knew what he wanted and got it. I was very surprised by the portrayal of Anne Boleyn since it is widely accepted that she was innocent and although Henry may have believed some of the charges just because he wanted so desperately to be rid of her I do not believe he was the instigator nor did he believe any of the charges in the beginning. This part could have been made more ""real"" by having Will redeem her, but it was dissapointingly negative and I felt no passion from him that would make a man move heaven and earth to marry. Maybe that is what is missing in general from the book - Henry does not seem to be a passionate man more of a ninny."
4,Henry VIII is no Cleo!,"Although a stunningly well-written, well-researched book, ""The Autobiography of Henry VIII"" falls short of George's ""The Memoirs of Cleopatra"". Margaret George has an amazing ability to bring her characters to life, make you feel their triumphs and heartaches and dread the ending of the book. The book did seem to falter near the end as she reached periods of Henry's life that were not as well documented (the marriage to Katherine Parr); however, it is a read you won't want to miss!"
3,Too loooooong....,"I wanted very badly to enjoy this book. I can say that I learned a lot about Henry VIII and this time period that I never knew and it definitely has aroused a new interest in me, but it was so long. It took me about a month to read this (and I read often); some points kept me interested and other parts just dragged. I most certainly enjoyed the parts about his wives! So many names were introduced and mentioned that I found myself often lost and confused as to what role they played in the story. After reading over 900 pages, I found the end very anti-climactic and was simply thankful that I was done. Overall, the story, itself, was very interesting (how can anyone say Henry VIII isn't?), the writing was enjoyable, but it was just too looooong!"
5,A Perfect Transaction - Thanks So Much!,"I purchased this cash register to use at craft fairs for my candle business - it came much quicker than I expected (thanks for that) and, even though it came without instructions (I bought a used item that did not originally belong to the seller after all) when I contacted the seller, he was more than willing to take it back if I could not figure out how to use it (which I did after printing out the instructions on line) which I thought was going above and beyond - so thanks for that too! It works like a charm and the price was right! I'd recommend this seller to anyone - anytime!"
3,Royal Cash Register,"A little disappointed we had to manually open the drawer with each sale, and with minimal use (and new batteries) the battery life was very short - the machine stopped working after several hours. It is nicely built and if you are ok with these two limitations, the price is good and the quality ok."
3,wouldn't order again,I was quite disappointed in the product for a really busy business such as ours because the draw DOES NOT open automatically when u ring up the sales !!!! U have to push it open as it is spring loaded. Not a very good feature as to any one walking by could open the draw and walk away with the $!!!!
3,portable cash register,"It's okay if you are in an area where you don't have access to electricity. It's very slow to print. It can be frustrating if your customers are in a hurry. Otherwise, it work well for us. I also didn't like the fact that you can & have to push on the drawer to open it. It does not open automatically when you finish the transaction."
3,Not Bad,"This is not a bad register. it works well. It is a bit slow. You have to push on the drawer to open it. One good improvement would be if it could take the carbonless journal tape rolls to be able to give a copy of the receipt and to keep one for my records. Other than that, it serves it's purpose."
2,One major problem,"Bought this register for use at a farmers market but found one bothersome problem that forced me to return it. It has an automatic shutoff when the register is not being used continuously (to save your batteries) and cannot be turned on again unless you remove the ""c"" batteries and reinstall them. Also, the on/off switch is beneath the paper tape cover which makes it inconvenient because you have to rethread the paper tape through the cover opening. Also, it is very slow in operation and when it gets busy, it cannot keep up. I'm better off going with a higher end register and use a rechargeable battery pack."
2,ah...no,"My 8 year old daughter gave this to me for Christmas. I've kept chickens for many years. I don't believe the writers of this book know what theyre talking about. When I read that the authors worked for a company that sold henhouses, it made perfect sense. Anyway, if you really want information on chickens, buy the American Standard of Perfection and/or The Beginners Guide to Raising and Showing Chickens (DVD..its awesome)- both available from the American Poultry Association website."
1,Not what advertised to be...,"while it is a quality coat and my husband is OK with it...I specifically looked for a NON-BELTED RAINCOAT....there were reviews about the ""no-belt"" coat and everything....YET....the coat most certainly has a belt....I will not order clothing again, I'm afraid..."
3,Music Video's a definte plus,"When ordering I was worried that the DVD wouldn't play on my machine but the CD contains the majority of Adam Ant's best so I figured I couldn't lose. Well to my delight, the DVD played and I was able to relive the days back in the 80s. As for the CD I was disappointed in the quality of the earlier tracks but overall this was a good purchase in getting the videos - finally."
2,Broke within one year,"This worked fine while it worked and was pretty easy to read and accurate, but it broke within a year of not especially hard use. For that, I don't recommend it."
5,The best Fabric Refresher,"I try many Fabric Refreshers and this one is the best.I got this on sale.Case Pack, Ten - 27.04 Bottles (270.4 Ounces) for just $29.99.I got this for 4 days (I use Super Saver Shipping)Condition was good,but box was wet inside and outside (because was snow,and little bit liquid was spilled)It's not a big deal for me.Febreze Fabric Refresher is fresh and smell a long time.Thanks, amazon for great shopping and price!"
1,Great writers but...,"The only tempting thing about this book is the fact that it is a romance but it should be placed on an erotica shelf. It was more sex and physical attraction more than romance and just having the two of them alone drove me mad, and I had to ask, where's everybody? where's the emotion? Michelle acted at impulses and by sleeping with Jake just because made me lose my respect for her as a mother in the quest to find her child. She was too FORWARD. Kind of making woman look bad. For the writers I say, go on keep writing, no problem! But still this book may have a happy ending of course but trust me, the characters in this book lack the Magnificency of a true romance."
5,Historical fiction set in the 1600s,"""The Water's Edge"" is a historical novel set in the 1600's in England and the fledgling colonies of the New World. For those who enjoy a storyline that follows a family or group of families through their daily life this will be a great read. The book follows three families from England to the American colonies as they seek a better life. Using the vehicle of a historical novel Virginia Parker does a masterful job of showing the complex relationships between the Quakers, the Puritans, the Indians, profit seekers, and those whose primary purpose was religious conversion. The reader comes to understand the difficulties of life in the colonies and many of the problems and triumphs to be had there. Become a part of the families as you live their hopes, their dreams, and their realities. A well-done, recommended book for anyone who enjoys fiction based on historical events."
5,A Spellbinder,"Virginia Parker has woven her superb research skills and her gift of storytelling into a spellbinder. Such strong, believable characters! I became one of them as they struggled to put down roots in the wild, stony New England soil. And at the end, when the three families succeeded, I didn't want to close the book.Virginia Law BurnsAward-winning Author of TALL ANNIE"
3,The Vampire Curse,Nothing new. It's parts of the soap put together to make a movie. Don't buy if you already own the soap.
3,Interesting...,"...on a level. I wouldn't watch it again, and do not feel it enhanced my entertainment experince in a significant way as to meaningfully have ""killed"" some time."
4,It's got bite!,"I liked this movie, though it seemed long in parts, it still kept my interest;) Love Barnubus's physical and mental transformation!"
2,The Vampire Curse,"Problem with this episode is that its just a compilation of various scenes from the original episodes and leaves out much of the details of how you get from one point in the story line to the next. It is very disappointing. Having seen the tv version and then watching this rendition of the tv series. I would have to agree with the previous review that the ""Dark Shadows: The Vampire Curse"" is not worth your money. Do not buy it as you will be disappointed if you have seen the original series as this rendition has been butchered so badly that it leaves big holes in the story line."
2,Waste of Money,"The idea of cutting the story of how Barnabas Collins became a vampire into a feature-length episode was a good one. However, this DVD has been poorly edited together and omits key plot moments that are sure to leave those unfamiliar with the storyline bewildered. And, in all honesty, new viewers are the only ones who this release would appeal to. Fans of ""Dark Shadows"" will more than likely already own the episodes, and there's simply no reason to waste money on something like this. Granted, it does feature a new (albeit brief) interview with Jonathan Frid. But that alone is not worth purchasing this DVD."
3,DARK SHADOWS THE VAMPIRE CURSE by Dan Silvio,"DARK SHADOWS:THE VAMPIRE CURSE released from MPI on Sept 15,2009.This DVD is an edited edition of episodes from the 1795 storyline. If you have the unedited VHS or DVD's this is hardly worth the money. Bonus material is the complete episode #221 in which Maggie Evans meets Barnabas Collins at the Collinsport Inn restaurant. The program originally aired 5/2/1967 written by Ron Sproat directed by John Sedwick, a PBS promo from Kathryn Leigh Scott and an interview with Jonathan Frid. (210 minutes)"
5,"Cut quickly, Cut clean","In my experience, this blade makes a fine, straight, usually splinter-free cut in thick and thin solid wood. I have used it on redwood and pine in various dimensions with great results. I have not personally used it on particleboard or plywood, but if Bosch says that it will work equally well on those, I will believe it. Buy a pack and try it for yourself."
4,Bosch Progressor Wood Blade,Buy these blades and not cheap blades - you get what you pay for in power accessories. These are like Sharks - it will handle wood cutting. I use these in my Dewalt Jig Saw on high variable speed. You want be sorry. Pay the few dollars more. Hope this helps.
5,Little charger that could,I left the my old charger in a hotel room and ordered this one. Worked perfectly for a couple of years and even outlasted the phone.
2,Don't Buy It!,"Let me sum this review up in one long sentence:Whenever I have a problem with ADO.NET and I have to refer to a book for the answer, I always start with this book, find nothing helpful at all, and end up finding the answer I need in 'ADO.NET in 24 Hours'."
3,Good book need more code samples on CD,"This book is pretty good. The one big shortfall for em was that it only includes samples from Chapter 11 to the end of the book. It would be nice to have some from the other chapters. The author suggests installing the e-version and then copying and pasting, but this is a big hassle when you could just open the solution and go from there!"
5,Excellent book - all technical books should be this good!,"There are already lots of good reviews of this book so I won't duplicate what they have already said.The feeling I got as I would finish each chapter of this book is that ""now I completely understand this part of ADO.NET"" including the classes, methods and properties involved. It was a very empowering feeling and I would highly recommend this book."
2,Maestro among the amatures,"With great excitement I purchased this DVD. I did not read all the reviews but I don't usually do that anyway. I wished I had. The best part was at the end when Luciano sang ""Nessum Dorma"". That is, of course, an all time favorite of all. Most guest singers were sad and cannot be compared to him so this review might not be fair. Andrea Bocelli was superb. Laura Pausini sang off key, so did Sting and some others. The floutist was truly superb however. Zucchero was terrific while singing a duet with the Maestro and another piano solo. It was spiritual and quite a surprise that Christian songs were chosen in Muslim ruled Jordan. Sherril Milnes sang a couple Christian songs at the beginning the program.....also very nice. It must be that I am not Italian. Maybe if I was, it would have been a better experience. I feel I wasted my $12.00. Better luck next time!"
2,nasal,"Upon listening to her music, I notice that the instrumentals rather reminiscent of cheap early nineties sythesizers. On top of this dissapointment, her music is rather quite bland, uninspiring and on the whole, not very good to listen to.I notice all the other reviewers have given her top scores for her music; however, the one most major flaw, in my opinion, would be in the way she sings. Why does it seem like her nose is doing most of the work. Is she singing through her nose? OR HER NOSE?Not to be pulling people away from this artist and sending them in another direction, but if you want to take a look at Utada Hikaru, I assure you that you won't be dissappointed. Try listening to both artists and then decide which CD you really want as these imports are so expensive."
4,"Nice extension, wish it had two stops","I bought this extension for my Bosch 3915 SCMS, and it came a few days after the saw did. It works well for holding work in place, but I do wish it came with two stops. It's a relatively minor complaint, and it's served me well, so I give it four stars."
1,Transcriptions Not Accurate!,"Don't waste your money on this guitar transcription book! When I ordered it I received an ""Easy for Guitar"" version which is not at all accurate. In fact many of the transcriptions are just completely wrong, and not even close. It was very frustrating because I have long wanted to learn a few of the more popular songs, Scarobourough Fair, Mrs. Robinson, etc...which really should have been fairly easy. This book only serves to mislead you with the wrong capo positions and transcription notes which are not even close. Very dissapointing!"
2,Only OK,"I am new to guitar, so it would have been helpful to have the chord fingering positions shown on the page. I know that I will grow into this book once I am more familiar with chords, but for now I can't use it. If I had opened this in the store I would have left it on the shelf."
2,Good for beginners only!,"You have to read the fine print on this one- it is not the tab that Paul Simon plays which I had wanted, it is an easy cheat version that is often inaccurate. Even where to capo is wrong on some of the songs. I have a piano/guitar book that has the real music. When I started to use this, I was very disappointed to see if was not the real deal. Also, there is a book that looks the same in all ways (except easy guitar label of course) that is out there so it is easy to buy this in error. I had used the real deal at a friend's house, and then came home and bought this book which I thought was the same.If it is an easy approximation you want, this is OK. If you want the real deal, beware. This is not it!"
5,"Work great, looks cool","You can't drop these coasters because they will break, but they are very effective. Just wash them every so often with a brush and dish soap. A real ""table saver""."
5,Great Saw!!!,"This saw lives up to all of the expectations. It has a smooth start, and a consistent rip.I've used cheap plastic saws before, and this one puts them in their place.The other reviewers weren't joking when they say that you'll be able to give this saw to your grand-kids someday. Hands down, this is the nicest saw that I've ever used!"
