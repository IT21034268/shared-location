2,Theory difficult to be applied,"The ISF is only valid if the perturbation is small, which limits the practicality of the theory.ISF also relies heavily on simulation which makes the theory more heuristic and less analytic."
4,john deere lead,Product was what I expected. However the product did not arrive during the time frame I was given. It ended up arriving two weeks after the given dates.
1,Poor Conceptualization,"This book is without structure or conceptualization. Monetary policy is an important topic, but the author has not addressed it in a worthy manner. Too many questions are left unanswered. How was monetary policy approached by Strong and Hoover? What were the economic traditions which provided the background for the ideas of each. What are the facts and figures describing what actually was going on in the American economy during the early days of the Fed? The author provides no conceptual framework for the poor reader who has to plow through endless quotations unlinked to any rational argument. This book was totally disorganized."
1,retail detail,"Like many books of this genre, this book has lots of details, many of which would be important in an economic context. Unfortunately, the book provides no economic context in which to understand the details. The reader looks in vain for a coherent structure to make sense of the facts presented. One gets the impression that the author is unfamiliar with basic economic theory. The reader is left with a sense of unconnectedness and wondering why he spent the time to read the book. Most of the information is available from other sources."
1,spare us the trivia,"Without any rational structure of analysis, this book piles high the trivia. Please, all ""academic"" authors out there, don't just list facts. Give the reader who has paid for the book some degree of intellectually complex analysis. One gets the impression that books are generated to credential promotions, not the enhance knowledge."
5,Love this item!!,I just got an under the desk keyboard tray and the mouse had no wrist pad....this little gem did the trick! PERFECT wrist support and it's small enough to fit nicely on the under the desk keyboard trays!! Great and inexpensive solution!!!
2,Smells Terrible!,"This would be a GREAT product is the chemical smell was not so bad and last so long. It has a horrible smell that just will not go away. I saw others mention the same issue but thought I would give it a try. It smells.Other than that, the comfort is great. But I gave it 2 weeks to air out and the smell will not go away. I would suggest you don't buy this is you have a sensitive nose. It kinda smells like those squishy foam beds and slippers you see at Brookstone."
3,Stiff,"Its not as soft as one would think, it almost has no give at all to your hand making it feel more like a rock than a cushion."
3,Not so soft...,"I purchased this product because I was developing a heel-of-the-hand callous from prolonged mousing. For this issue, it was not helpful, as it is too dense and did not redistribute the pressure enough. On a more positive note, it adheres passively to the desk, making it a good 'backstop' for the bead-bag type of wrist rest that I place on top of it. The combination has given excellent results (except for the ergo-bead bag occaisionally falling to the floor). The ideal product: a combination of the two!"
2,hard as a rock,"I purchased this item based on the reviews but I must say I'm disappointed. I condsider the gel very hard for its purpose. It does position my wrist correctly but the gel is so hard that my wrist still ends up hurting. I am going to switch to a bean bag type and see if that is better. Regarding the smell, I do smell it when I put it to my nose but not when it is being used correctly. I don't have a problem with any smell."
2,Smells Awful,"The product works well and stayed firm, but the smell is horrible and will not go away. It smells like a solvent is leeching out. I was hoping it would go away, but after several weeks my office still smells like someone spilled a bottle of mineral spirits over those old vinyl capes from Star Wars figures."
5,Great,Helped with my pain of leaning the edge of my wrist in order to use my mouse with lap top. Use it whenever I don't want to be leaning on a hard surface for too long
2,Too hard,"I bought this to replace a soft gel pad wrist rest that had a fabric cover. Once the cover got torn, the gel leaked and made it sticky. Unfortunately, this one is too hard compared to that last one. There's very little give so not that good for people with carpel tunnel or other wrist ailments."
1,Sigh,"""Mini"" wrist rest? Not so much. This was much bulkier than I expected (which is saying something, considering that I have a 17"" MacBook Pro) and not very flexible. I expected something a little more conforming, but this wrist pad is quite hard. Returned for refund."
3,Works as advertised,This item works as advertised. In the end my kids wouldn't leave it on my desk long enough for me to enjoy it. I think it's a pillow for a stuffed animal now. So it goes.
3,small & sweaty,"It's comfortable but I live in Florida and my office is on the warm side. The plastic covering starts feeling warm pretty quickly. It's also a little on the small side, if you move your hand much it won't work. I'm using it with a trackball so theoretically my hand isn't moving yet I still ""fall off"" of this sometimes."
2,wrist rest,Item is too hard & inflexible. It appears soft and states it is gel but is actually too uncomfortable to use.
5,I wish I had a pair of shoes this comfortable!,"Just received my wrist gel pad today and what a difference! No more soreness from my wrist resting on the sharp edge of the keyboard tray. At first, the gel is a bit too firm but as your body heat warms it, it softens like a comfortable glove for your wrist to rest upon. I use it with a wireless optical mouse and it's perfect for that. I can move it around as need be without the location being constrained by an attached mouse pad or the pot holder I've been using to ease the pain in my wrist.Earlier today I found myself wondering and wishing if there were any of these gel pads made for shoes, it is that comfortable!"
3,So so wrist support,"I was so excited when I received this product! My wrists were always sore and in pain from being on the computer so much. Since that's a must (I do all my work AND schoolwork online as well as play) I decided to get me one of these. The first few uses were excellent, no pain at all. But I noticed still when I am on for a long while the wrist supporter does almost nothing for the cause and I still go to bed with Sore wrists. Maybe it just isn't made for someone whose on as much as I am. It only provides comfort for a short while then the same horrible pains come back."
4,Not suitable for small wrists,"I ordered this wrist rest to replace a similar one that had worn out. My old one was more elongated in shape, where this one is quite wide. I have a very small wrist, and am finding the width of this wrist rest to be uncomfortable. My wrist is sitting on top of the pad, rather than leaning over the edge, which makes my skin sticky/sweaty and is causing a small blister. For someone with a larger wrist, I would definitely recommend this product. The quality is good, and the non-skid backing keeps it nicely in place. However, if you are a petite woman or young adult, I would recommend buying one that is more narrow and elongated rather than thick and wide. It's simply too large for a tiny arm and wrist."
3,"Good advice, but focuses only on what we say","There is good advice here, and know I will refer to the book often. But, there were two things that bothered me while I read it. First, some parts are hard to follow. An example is when the author gives real life examples of families. Family members and friends are often mentioned when they haven't been introduced yet, so as I read along, another name suddenly pops up,and I must stop and figure out ""who is this?"" Only after going back and then reading all the way through the paragraph again do I figure out the relationships. Second, the advice is really only based in the things we say to our loved ones. Communication is great, but simply saying these ""magical phrases"" alone is not enough. Before saying any of these affirmations to someone, it might be useful to ask questions to understand where they're coming from and if they even want affirming. It seems like the author presumes you already know when these affirmations are useful."
4,The number 1# recorder!,"I am a real recorder player. A soprano recorder is a simple instrument that can only hit the easy notes, but the alto is useful for some of the lower songs. I advise you to buy the soprano recorder first, then after years of practice on the soprano recorder you might be ready to try out the big one (alto recorder). This one is made out of ivory and has really good fingering plus extra holes for low notes. If your a recorder player and you have no alto. Buy this one."
5,Wonderful!,"My parents had used the SuperPuppy book with my dog when I was growing up, so naturally when I got my first puppy this book was the first resource that I turned to. I have not been disappointed yet! Clear and concise, very simple instructions and the best part is that they work!"
1,No More Alpha Rolls,"I dislike the concept of using force on a dog, especially a puppy. This book still preaches the outdated Alpha Roll, which teaches a dog to use force and is based on the Wolf Pack model. Domesticated dogs aren't wolves, and would you use everything a wolf uses? Does that mean you'd feed your dog by eating first, then regurgitating so the puppy can eat? Nonsense.Ian Dunbar, Joel Walton, Patricia McConnell and Pat Miller have much better training books."
1,"Think of ""The Wedding Singer""","This CD is reminicient of the bad music you hear at weddings with live singers, or the Sweeney Sisters from SNL. Definitely NOT a necessity for Madonna fans!!!"
3,Not Madonna,"This is not Madonna in anyway shape or form. At times, the lyrics are different and the music is not the same as Madonna's but it's a good CD single. Get it if you like Madonna and want a medley of her early hits even though it's not her.."
1,"DON""T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!!",This is a very cute product but very cheaply made. We bought one for our daughter-it worked for about 2 weeks. Then we exchanged for another one and it did the same thing as the first one and we had to return it. We bought the matching princess tv and that works great but don't waste your money on this. You will be disappointed!
1,Very Disappointed!! Waste of Money!,"Bought this DVD player for my daughter for her birthday. It worked for only a few weeks and then just stopped. It would not respond to anything we did. Had to unplug it to get it to shut off. Now it won't even turn on. It is very cute and looks nice with the matching TV, but a complete waste of my money!!"
1,broke less then 2 weeks after christmas,"tHIS WAS NOT BROKEN BY MY KIDS, IT JUST DOESNT WORK, DOES NOT READ ANY DVD ANYMORE, JUST TRYES TO READ THEM FOREVER AND EVER."
3,"not bad if you're a stripper, but otherwise.....","The instructions are clear and understandable, she repeats over and over so you can easily follow and get it down. Then she takes the same move she's just demonstratd and shows you how you can easily incorporate them into the other moves she teaches on this video.She very clear and takes you step by step (especially in the floor moves) while explaining the type of interaction you'll have w/the customer - I can only assume a real stipper would find this dvd invaluable.Otherwise, not much else. For 10 bucks I'd buy it; for the $40 bucks it sells for, I wasted my money altogether."
3,okay,this video gives a good overview of some moves you can do however i didn't think it was very easy to learn from more like a showcase of fawnias talent it did have some good tips she repeats the moves over and over fast but doesn't take the time to really show them slowly and explain them
1,"Useless, useless, useless","This book is useless. I originally bought this guide because I had a hard time understanding the explainations in the original book. Turns out that this guide explains it the exact same way. Copying basically everything in the red box in the book. Bottom line, if you can't understand the book, you can't understand this guide."
4,Children of the Grave 2,"I like the way the Booth brothers present the history and stories surrounding the hauntings. But I just wish I could HEAR the interviews and EVP's. The music is so over powering that it drowns out the voices. I had to constantly rewind to try and figure out what was being said. This is what happened in their last video. I was hoping it wouldn't be the same here but sadly the music seemed more important for me to hear I guess lol . Thier previous videos were great! I could hear the interviews and the music was just subtle in the background. Other then that, if you can hear over VERY LOUD music, the children of the grave 2 is something I would recomend."
4,Really sad but more need to know about what some children went through at different times in our history. We need to NEVER walk,"You can really see what this crew feels all of time they are doing this. Who is going to give these little ones a voice? They needed to have their pain and heart be opened to everyone. At least we are given the chance to pray and try to help, so this doesn't happen again to such tender young spirits."
5,Clearly awesome,"This is a great album from start to finish. In it contains 4 transcription performances, and a live gig at the 400. The sound quality is clear, and the songs are awesome, or should I say, clearly awesome!!"
2,what a disappointment!,"The perfume did not arrive intact. Almost half was gone, and saturated the sealed box. The shipper never returned my call, either."
5,Perfect .... for me!,"PS London is a Fall/Winter scent for me. I think PS London is best described as a green woody oriental. It is just a tad sweet, and it has some characteristics of a gourmand without being one. However, it's a huge powder bomb, and I love it!There's nothing ""London"" about PS London to me. I just don't get the name or the package (which is a 'tube' btw). Paul Smith is known to twist classics and play on words. I've not yet figured out the riddle in PS London.Totally under-rated & very unique, PS London is sample-worthy for anyone who likes the category or notes. I bought it blind here. No blind buy remorse! I highly recommended this one, and I intend to rebuy it."
4,REVIEW ON Quicken Legal Business Pro 2007,NICE PRODUCT - EASY TO USE AND SEEMS TO HAVE ALOT OF INFO THAT ONE WOULD LOOK FOR IN A PRODUCT.
5,Quicken Legal Business Pro 2007,Very easy to use. Quite user friendly. Really like the help and hints and web links. Would recommend this product highly...
4,Caution: Contents May Burn,"In in a series of freestyle compilations, Tazmania Vol. 5 carries on the tradition which made it stand out from the rest. I'm speaking of quality production, vocals, lyrics, and unique melodramatic melodies. Notable songs include Pure Pleazure's ""Bring Me Back"", Pain's ""Share this Moment"", and Sammy C's ""Tonight"". If you're into hardcore oldschool freestyle, then this album is worth having. If not, then get with it!"
2,Lighten Up Please,"I once heard that Frank Zappa was inspired by Varese, so I decided to give him a listen. Now I understand why I never really took to the Mothers of Invention. Varese's composing style seems very heavy handed. Generally the brass and percussive pieces are really (and too often) over-layered and over-the-top, and his use of percussive toys is, all to often, way over done. The electronic experimentations seem disjointed and simple and don't really seem to fit well and the vocals seem a bit silly. Having said these things, three pieces (11-12 minutes of sound out a 140 minute-plus 2 disk box) did work very well for me - Ionisation, Density 12.5 and Dance For Burgess, which were all on disk 2. So now I program these as an enjoyable little 3 piece suite."
5,WOW!,"Extraordinario Album de la música de Edgar Varese, Riccardo Chailly tiene la gran virtud de ser uno de los directores de orquesta que más interpreta y graba música de poca difusión, lo cual es indudablemente un gran aporte a los aficionados a la música. En estas sus interpretaciones de la obra de Varese el Maestro Chailly demuestra un conocimiento profundo del significado de esta maravillosa música. Cuando mas uno escucha estas obras más las aprecia.Cómprelo, Fuertemente recomendado."
2,A collection of mistakes,"Neither Varèse was Czeck nor born in 1885. Please be moreserious...The double CD is a light version of Varèse, and Chailly hasnot the personality (or, perhaps, the level) for a Varèse anthology. Even more: the most part of the pieces have been ""revised"", ""edited"" and/or ""completed"" by Chou Wen-chung, a bad composer, whose business has been to proclaim his condition of former Varèse student. This is not enough to have the right of manipulate Varèse's compositions after his death. Let's stop this conspiration, done with the cooperation of anti-cultural copyright laws."
1,"Good storyline, poor execution!","It's OK if you have no idea about public speaking. Good points mentioned in the video, but the acting and all together the video is not done well. It's a good example of bad instructional material."
3,Somewhat disappointing,"For the cost of the product we expected it to be delivered assembled. Having said that, it does look the same as photo shown on page. I would add to the description that it is delivered flat packed and requires complete assembly by purchaser.Atlantic 94835721 Windowpane 576 CD or 192 DVD Blu-Ray Games Wood Look Cabinet with Sliding Glass Doors (Espresso)"
3,Pretty - but disappointed,I bought this tea kettle because it would look so nice in my kitchen. I am sorry that I did not study the description more closely. This tea kettle does not have a whistle. There have been times I have put on water for tea and have forgotten about it. Pretty dangerous.
2,Not Edited how did this ever make it to 9th edition?,The text and math of this book seem fair untill you try to match up what the text talks about with the figures. There are times when the text refers to figures that don't exsist or refers to the wrong figure. There are figures that are suppose to have a part a and part b. The text compares the 'difference' but there is only one figure and no parts a or b. Overall a very confusing book.
5,Birth Charm,This Celtic Birth Charm is great. I bought it for my daughter for Christmas and she hasn't taken it off since. I looks better in person.
4,Media Products,This product works great for labeling all of the DVDs we make for our instructors. It is easy to use and the price is right.
3,Don't Seem Quite the Same As Smaller Quantity Boxes,"It seems to me that these labels are much thinner than those sold in smaller packages. They curl quite a bit more when removing them from the sheet and, at least those in the package I got, don't seem to have quite as much sticking power.They are OK but I don't think I'd buy this packaging again."
5,sober23and counting,"The last writer is on a Jesus soap box. This book and AA meetings have made a better person, a more loving person and a better Christen out of me. All recovery depends on a decision to trust God, make amends for past sins, and live a clean and sober life. Most people may want to stop abusing but cannot or will not change the way they think and live. I believe Jesus delivered me but someone else may think Buddha helped them. I tried the way of religion and the way of no religion and still was miserable. This book guided me to a new spiritual life that no church or religion could do."
4,Great Little Devotional,I purchased this book as a devotional specifically designed for alcoholics. It is one of the better ones I have read. It offers one page per day (no matter the year) and covers one aspect of life per day. Easy to read and understand. What I like most is that it has a more spiritual side than many secular books that talk about God and how he works in our lives. Powerful little punch in this dandy little book.
2,24 hours,The book was very worn n there were drawings all over the pages as if though they had given the book to a kid to use for a pad. I dont think i will be ordering again.
1,This is the OLD version,"This is the old version of 24 hours a day from 1954. This old edition is not sensitive to genders and uses some older language that is not as clear as the current edition. I also don't like the format of this edition, two meditation per page."
3,good sobriety but heavy for the mornings,i picked up this book a little bit ago when my sober living home was using it to run its morning meditation group. i am not a morning person and because of this i found it was hard to wrap my mind around what was written. there are alot of good thoughts for the day but i prefer something a little bit lighter to start my day off with.
2,Too Small,"Too small, wasn't expecting a pocket size book with very small print. Many in my AA group cannot read it."
2,print too small,could not enlarge print on mini ipad. this is a great book i wish it would enlarge on the ipad
2,Does not accurately reflect AA program,"While it may be helpful to some recovering alcoholics, it has some issues:*It is one person's interpretation of the AA program, wherein the author interjects numerous personal beliefs that are not part of the AA program*It is sectarian in nature, whereas AA is not*It contains numerous ""commandments"" that are not found in the AA program, nor are they a requirement for AA membershipThe fact that it is published by an outside enterprise (Hazelden) and was rejected by AA twice (1954 and again in 1972) and may be found objectionable/offensive by some if read in meetings should also be considered.All that aside, many AAs find it useful as a devotional for their own private studies and reflection."
5,awesomeness,awesome book. got the large-print large version so it could reside on my coffee table. read the devotions daily and love it!
5,twenty-four hours a day,This book is Excellent for anyone in AA desiring a walk with God and being Sober till theyare taken to Heaven to be with Him. It gives you great insight on how precious & for-fillinglife can be if we are completely Honest with ourselves.
4,good for kids just starting to get into this kind of stuff,"This is a great product for the price. It is very portable and useful. I loved mine when I was 11 but now that I am 14 it is not enough memory for me. Although, I still like to use the fm radio on it since my ipod does not have one. Like I said before it is good for the price and it is very durable for kids that are hard on things. You won't be disappointed."
2,Thumbs down,"The software is not what I expected, the tutorial is not good at all. I do not reccomend this software to anyone."
3,Good brown sauce shortcut,"Great for making a quick brown sauce (think gravy) for a weeknight meal. The flavor isn't overwhelming, but is a good value."
5,"WOW!! Linux, here I come!","I've been curious about Linux for some time now. But, the only books that I could find, are all on installing, administering, configuring. Every one rehashing what the other said. None of them sold me on diving in.When I discovered this book, I was apprehensive, but I went for it and purchased it. All I have to say is WOW! I never realised how flexible Linux is, or how much you could do.I was thouroughly impressed on the variety of this book. I've finally been inspired to dive right in to Linux."
1,Bad value,"This is one of the most frustrating books I know. The hand-drawn illustrations are highly atmospheric. If you are interested in identifying and understanding ethnic jewelry, it's absolutely useless, because it's impossible to see any detail of the jewelry at all. Try Haberlandt's ""Traditional and Folk Jewelry"" instead. On the other hand, if you're interested in jewelry in action, you're probably better off with a stack of old National Geographics. When I first read the title, I thought it was written for me, but when I saw the book itself I was deeply disappointed. Not worth waiting for"
4,Beautiful Book,"While this book may not be for the person wanting an in depth study of ethnic jewelry, it is a marvelous book for seeing the vast array of styles and cultures. I am not an ethnic jewelry expert. For me, this book is merely to remind myself that the entire world doesn't/hasn't always shop at The Gap. It's a way to see the pantheon of cultures out there, to see what people in Turkistan wore or what the Maori wore for jewelry. In that reagrd it succeeds phenomenally. Although it is too bad that these are illustrations and not photos."
5,Flemings overall musical knowledge is outstanding.,Few singers have the capacity of making a piece come alive into a new fresh work. The way she can change from one character to another is very unique and human. This CD has given me a great respect for American Operas. She is one of the best sopranos I've had listen to. I trully recomend this recording to anyone who enjoys great music.
1,Beat up and flaking coating.,"When I received this the packaging it came in was perfect, not a scratch or dent on it, but the pot on the other hand....the pot, the steamer, and the lid were all bent. Bent badly enough in different places that the lid wouldn't lay flat without attempting to bend it back by hand...which didn't work. Its scratched so badly that the coating is flaking off. I'm returning asap. If I get a replacement in good condition then I'll change my review otherwise I stand at 1 star for this poorly made and received product. Shame on you Amazon! (Again I repeat: It was NOT the fault of UPS who delivered it, the box was in perfect shape.)Update on the product its self: Works fine. Deep enough. Love that the basket just lifts and drains away. I used it to make tamales and it held quite a few of them. Still pretty pissed about the condition it was received in. Bent lid on a steamer means the steam doesn't stay in."
2,Mine was damaged too!,"Don't waste your time. Product sticker was cleverly placed over a substantial ding in the pot so you couldn't notice the damage from the outside. The ding was large enough that it dented the inside of the pot causing the inside coating to flake off. Until Amazon or this Graniteware company can improve their quality control, I wouldn't recommend ordering this product--unless you like to receive damaged goods and waste your time returning them."
2,Go to your local Wal-mart or Target,"Received first shipment of Graniteware damaged and it had to be returned. Received second replacement Graniteware, and it too was damaged. At least the lid fit snug and non of the 'granite' was chipping and flaking off like the first one. So I settled with it and didnt return it since I had been looking forward to doing some serious steaming. Went shopping at Target a week later and had seen the 'graniteware' in the kitchen pots and pans section, I believe it was less expensive there too..."
4,Crab feed!,"This pot is pretty great. I would consider myself a beginner in terms of my cooking abilities, but I was still able to make a gourmet meal for my boyfriend which made me feel great about myself.I got some crab, lobster, clams, mussels, and shrimp, and I steamed it using timing instructions I found on google. It was super easy to make, all you do is boil a couple of inches of water in the bottom part, and throw the seafood party inside. This pot holds a lot of seafood (probably could fit 3 dungeness crabs in there) so this would be great if you have a family or guests.However, I don't think this item can get 5 stars because the handles get really hot, so when you're done cooking, you still need those oven mittens to handle the pot. It is also a real pain to clean, and takes up way too much space in my cabinets."
5,PROGRESSIVE,"EXCELENT DEBUT ALBUM FROM VERY TALENTED AMERICAN BAND . MUSIC IS VERY WELL CRAFTED MIXTURE BETWEEN FATES WARNING , 7 MONTHS AND QUEENSRYCHE ! BUY IT !"
4,basic primer on political philosophy,"I'm using this book for my introduction to comparative politics course. It's fine as far as it goes. It's essentially a primer on different political philosophies. Don't expect anything groundbreaking or exceptional in this book. The text is easy to read - something very important to my undergrads. The authors do a fair job describing the intellectual history of each political philosophy. Sometimes the chapters break down and just become a laundry list of historical developments and the larger thematic development is lost. Nonetheless, if you want your students to learn about Liberal, Conservative, and Fascist ideologies, this book will do the trick."
2,Not the best book,I bought this book mainly on the reviews from Amazon readers. I was disappointed because I expected so much more. The recipes are not the greatest from the Thai cuisine - at least I have experienced much better food.
1,"Don't order this, they'll send you the wrong item!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",They told me if I removed my bad review that they would send me the correct item. I mailed it back because they said they would reimburse the S&H. That hasn't happened and they refuned my purchase and now tell me that the item no longer exists. WTF?????????????????????????????
3,"Looks, not Use","This doll is totally cute, but it isn't very durable. It is mostly to admire rather than to play with. The batteries don't last very long, and it is hard to determine when the will dance. But they are fun to play with without a battery too!"
4,Form Meets Function,"I love the way this looks and it operates very smoothly. It offers two different grinds of pepper. My only gripe would be that once it's half-way empty, the two grinds pretty much come out the same: large chunks. Other than that, it's affordable, pretty, and serves its purpose."
5,Great classic big band!,"What a fine cd! This music is now among my most favorite from Artie Shaw, if not all bands of the time. Sound quality is really good as well. Buy this and enjoy."
2,where's Haruka Kanata?,The Naruto soundtrack is is completely instrumental with the exception of track 22. Track 22 is the song Wind. This soundtrack does not have the anime favorite Haruka Kanata by Asian Kung-Fu generation if that's what you're looking for.
1,Beware of confusion with the Naruto movie soundtrack,"I bought ""this"" CD new from one of the individual sellers for a price of $9.95. Unfortunately, when I recieved it, the CD turned out to be the Naruto: Orginal Movie Soundtrack. Apparently, the seller confused it with this one.If you are interested in buying the Naruto: Original Movie Soundtrack, the main Amazon site doesn't have it. If you really want it, then buy ""this"" CD from the seller ""a1entertainment"" for $9.95. They should send you the movie soundtrack.To be on the safe side, I would just buy this CD from Amazon, and not some other individual seller."
2,Wrong Item sent,The chargers that were sent were correct but I was sent a skin surround and not the pictured case. It goes over the current cover and only protects the edges. This is not what I ordered and definitely not what was advertised.I have contacted the company about a replacement but I have not been contact yet. Hopefully this will be fixed and I can change my review!
5,Good CD,"Have always been a fan of Audrey Tautou, and this movie is no exception. Interesting take on the early life and career beginnings of this fashion designer."
5,Great movie,Seen this on movie channel and wanted to watch it again .I don't think most guys would like it .
4,Mesmerizing,"Fortunately, this is not a Hollywood sugar coated revision. Intelligent and visually beautiful film, without a tad of cheap sentimentality. Completely exceeded my expectations and further increased my disgust toward American movies."
1,It's in French!,I did not notice that this movie was subtitled and actually in french.Wasn't worth the trouble of reading the subtitles.
1,Frustration,I am unable to run this product on my home cinema system: zone conflict! Very frustrating that you can deliver products which are not readable in Europe!A. Heimo
3,BEFORE SHE WAS CHANEL,"Early tales of Coco before she was known for Chanel. A lot of it has to do with her youth in an orphanage and her desire to become comfortable and safe by living or marrying rich men. Unfortunately, those rich men are aristocrats and are never going to marry a commoner which leads to Coco having her heart broken and never marrying for the rest of her life. If you want to see a lot of fashion this isn't it but if you want to learn about Coco's early years and what drove her, well, this is one to check out. CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B minus to B; STORY/PLOTTING: B minus (bit slow at times as it is foreign); SETTING: B; OVERALL GRADE: B minus to B; WHEN WATCHED: early May 2011."
5,Always a Classic,"Movie is amazing and really makes you appreciate the freedom Chanel brought to all women. However, the packaging for the DVD felt cheap and flimsy."
1,Don't buy this DVD!,"DO NOT MAKE THE MISTAKE OF BUYING THIS DVD! I bought this movie because I wanted to see the original French version, but with English subtitles. I was dismayed and disappointed to discover that, although the menu had ""play movie"" as an option, the DVD contained plenty of stories about the making of the film BUT NOT THE FILM ITSELF!! It was a complete waste of money. The description was completely false and misleading! I guess I'm stuck with it, since I made this mistake of assuming it would be as described and so not saving the packaging and receipt. I only hope no one else makes this same mistake and throws their money away as I did."
1,Terrible Subtitles,"Unless you are fluent in French, this DVD is a total waste of money. The subtitles are nothing short of horrendous. Most of the time there are none and when one suddently appears it adds nothing to the storyline. I missed huge portions of the plot as a result."
2,Not in English,I gave this a low rating because I was not aware when I bought the movie that it is entirely in French with English subtitles. I read to slowly to keep up with some of the subtitles so I only watched about 10 minutes of the movie. I was very disappointed.
3,An engaging fashion show,"If you like costume dramas, you will like this movie as it regales in early 20th century fashion with young Coco cutting through the frilly Victorian outfits with her clean cut dresses and peasant suits and hats. Unfortunately, the movie didn't seem to rise very far beyond beautiful photo shoots with the most interesting character being the Baron Balsan, who provides much needed humor given Coco's deadpan earnestness, as if she were taking on the world.Of course Coco Chanel is one of the 20th century's fashion giants, but there was hardly anything original in her work at the time. It was just that she found herself in a stuffy environment and managed to design her way out of it and into the hearts of Parisians who were clamoring for something new. I expected more from this biopic than just an elaborate promo for the House of Chanel."
1,Needs To Be Properly Trans To English.,"I rented this and I am so Thankful I did. I speak English, Spanish, Italian, some German and learning French. However I wanted to badly to see the early life of Coco that I did rent it. I have to say unless you do understand and or speak French do not rent or buy this film. When it comes to the so called "" sub titles"", they are not there for us. At times there are none, then they will appear suddenly way behind making no meaning to watch is currently showing. I am sure that if I spoke French fluently I would have enjoyed the film. It is for this reason that I must say take a chance rent it if you are not fluent in French. As well the manufacture is at fault for the worngful sub tilting on the dvd. Hope this helps even one person who is thinking on renting this film prior to buying it. Cheers, Peace & Blessings."
4,The movie is as smart as its title would suggest.,"An intriguing look at one of the most prominent designers of our time. This is the story of Coco Chanel's beginnings. However embellished, the movie provides an important lesson on independence and living life on one's terms."
3,Captures Coco's essence,"I was very eager to see this film, and to see Tautou's performance of a young Coco. The musical score is something to note and it beautifully fit each aspect of tone. Tautou delivers a supurb performance as Coco, perhaps the best I've seen so far: she captures the cool, elegant essence of a young Chanel and triumphs over all others who have attempted to play this role. However, the film tone felt a bit cold, a bit removed and although Tautou's performance was stellar, it was not enough to make this a favourite or even one I would buy. After seeing Shirley McClaine as an older Chanel, I was expecting a bit more from this film. Not a disappointment and definitely worth seeing but if you enjoyed CoCo, the woman, the designer, the legend as much as I continue to, this may not be the film you expect, or hope it to be."
5,Beautiful!!,"I think I am in love with slow, subtle and very in depth movies. This is a winner!I loved Julie and Julia for the character sketches of these two women and the men who loved them and all the wining and ding that went with it.Coco is captivating in its subtly beautiful portrayal of a somewhat tragic yet conquering heroine.The cinematography is gorgeous, the characters are deep, and Coco Chanel is a triumph.Audrey Tatou does a wonderful job of portraying this cliché of ""rags to riches"" in a very dignified and triumphant way. And really Coco Chanel was a truly rags to riches life so is it really cliché?This movie is in subtitles and very quickly you forget that it is. If you loved Babette's Feast you know what I mean.See this movie and be captivated!"
3,"Strong, Good looking wacth but. .","The problem with purchasing a wacth on-line is the picture of watch doesn't reflect the actual watch after all the photoshop processing. I bought this watch and when the watch arrived, I realized that colors at the face is not as bright as it appears on the picture. I would say at least 3 tones darker, be aware. Other than this, it is a nice looking and strong watch!"
3,Interesting but a bit exaggerated,"This is a very serious attempt to redefine the rules of marriage in a society where the rules are deeply rooted in the traditional social values.Serious as it might be, the director has chosen the comedy and the exaggerations as the means of transferring the message.The constant challenge between the young couple, the expected disagreements and the possible areas of conflict are soon becoming predictable and funny.Soon the funny side of the story is suppressed by the exaggeration and the expected might even become a bit boring.The message is understood right from the beginning and it is not further reinforced by any additional dialog or events.Interesting to see once."
1,Not very impressed,"The movie arrived on time but the quality is pretty bad and I cant even finish the movie because it freezes. So not impressed. Also the subtitles are really bad, they cant follow what's been said so anyone that doesn't speak the language will have a real hard time keeping up.I would even go as far as throwing it in the bin.Regards"
3,"Great content, great (no longer mediocre) encoding","And THIS is why I love Unbox better than iTunes: I saw that episode 2 was correctly encoded at 24fps. So I went back and re-downloaded episdoe 1, and found that now it's encoded correctly as well! Thanks!Um, apparently I can't change my star rating above? I'd put it up to 5 stars now if I could.Here's what I originally said---------------------------Love the show, like using Unbox to watch on my own schedule.But I don't like the fact that the encoding does not handle the 24-to-29.97 frames per second conversion very well. Action scenes in particular are jittery.When I bought earlier seasons on iTunes, the resolution was a little lower, but at least they played smoothly.Please either encode at 24fps (film, not video), or do the de-telecining/interlacing better. Thanks."
4,Great Series,"The ONLY reason that this is 4, not 5, stars is that it annoys me that they split the season in 2 (4.0, 4.5) This series is well written and thought out and is better than the original. Very impressed, highly recommended."
1,Wrong Show,"Hey, Unbox, put the right damn show on. I don't want to see a stupid show about some witness protection service. If you don't fix this problem soon I will have to go through other means to obtain these shows."
3,Not as good as the first 3,"I'm a true Battlestar Galactica fan. I own all the seasons.However I thought season 4 was not nearly as good as the first 3.There's way too much emphasis on politics in this season. Much of the dialogue felt forced and I was constantly waiting for the ball to get rolling before I found myself on the last DVD and kind of disappointed.It seems like at least half the episodes didn't feature the Cylons at all, and rather focused on the politics within the fleet, as I stated before.Don't get me wrong, Season 4, is interesting, and Battlestar Galactica is one of the best shows on TV, so if you're a fan, it's worth picking up; however, if you're not a hard core fan but still like the show, pick up one of the first 3 seasons, because they were much better as far as action and suspenseful dialogue is concerned."
2,You got your In Plain Sight in my BSG!,"Guess a wire got crossed at Unbox HQ and people thought they were getting their weekly BSG fix and instead get the pilot for In Plain Sight. Heh.The show is interesting, I guess...Mary McCormick...rawr"
4,"At its best, it is wonderful","""Battlestar Galactica: Season 4"" is very much in keeping with the rest of the series. It has a few very good episodes but many episodes are quite tedious. I do not understand why this series gets so much praise, when the humans are constantly depressed and the Cylons are endlessly babbling. I'm happy that so many people enjoy the show, and when it's at its best, it is wonderful, but its relentless showcase of despondency is a bit much. Reviewed 4/5/2009 after watching on DVD."
3,BSG is still great but...,"I love the new BSG, and have been a big fan ever since the series started. What I like about the series: the phenomenal writing, dialogue, character development, and filming that makes you feel like you are one of the colonials.However, I was a little disappointed that this season felt a bit gimmicky. Last season ended with the shocker of finding out 4 of the final 5, and they were folks from the Galactica. There was so much promise in this direction but, right from the beginning sequences it proved disappointing (""The final cylon to be revealed"" or something like that). It felt like something a magician would say, ""Your final cylon will be rrrrrrrrrevealed!""With all that said, I am addicted, and I bought this season, and I will be buying the upcoming season."
4,Best Sci-Fi series ever,"There was a lot to live up to after season 3, and season 4 mostly lives to to expectations. With the exception of the some of the Baltar storylines which I find a distraction, the episodes are tight and the flow through the series very logical.The real punches come in the last two episodes however and all BSG fans must be on the edge of their seats for Season 4.5."
4,learn who the final cylon is,"Don't worry, no spoilers here.After many many months of waiting, we finally have the premier of the second half of season 4. We see the 4 known cylons reacting to the planet, we see how the BSG crew reacts to the planet, and we learn the identity of the final cylon. A very good episode."
2,half a deal is no deal,"What you pin heads neglect to tell people is that season 4.0 is not season four, it is half of a season. Nice getting your delivery and then realising that you have half a season. So if you mark this season 4 out of five stars, cut that to 2 stars. Was a day when advertising was supposed to be accurate. Guess those laws have been dumped too."
5,Best complete series in a long time,"Too often shows overstay their welcome or just plain go down-hill. Battlestar managed to stay consistently good (despite some weakness midseason 2) and, with this season, end strong. It was a great conclusion that brought closure to all major story and conceptual arcs."
2,Final Dive,"Once the ""Final Five"" theme was introduced, this series fell toward the abyss.I admired the first three seasons, and was hoping the decline would be reversed in 4.0. Not the case. The FF theme is a narrative killer. It allowed the writers to fill up copy books with writing that should have been nixed in writers' conferences. Excellent actors go through the motions dramatizing these five non entities.All five characters are reduced to unconvincing cut outs. Their previous character development goes down the drain. You can have no interest in these hollowed out creatures, they show no convincing motivation.Meaningless ending to a final season that should have been stellar."
4,Decent quality - little pricey,I ordered this one episode because I missed it. The price per episode is a little high for my taste but the image quality was decent enough.
3,Seller feedback,"The seller did a good job of getting the product to me in a short time. Technically, the product was in excellent condition.I was a bit disappointed with the show, however. It became tedious and characters were changing their personality frequently.So many characters were brought into the story, that I found it confusing."
5,Great Series,This is a great series for the sci-fi fan. Stellar proformances good plots and lots of intrigue. I love my Battlestar Galatica series.
5,Season 4.0,"I think my only complaint about Season 4.0 is that the powers-that-be who decide when to package the DVDs for sale have split the season up much the same way that the network did. I would have preferred to have been able to purchase ALL of season 4 as one item, rather than having to wait for the second half.Other than that..brilliant first half!"
4,The Begining of the End,"It's the start to the finish. Will Kara be the Angel of Death, what is Baltars role, what happens after Earth?Only ten episodes to go. Let's ride the bullet."
5,Great Sci-Fi that only gets better,"BSG has shown that you can have adult and smart fun with Sci-Fi and not have to ""talk down"" to the fans. In this set of DVD's we are given answers to many of the questions posed over the past few seasons but at the same time new questions and old ones are pressed upon us. I don't believe in giving away any story lines. I do feel safe in saying that viewers will be pleased at the story line and with the great cast as they wrap up their story with not a wink or a nod, but with dedication to the parts they have played. What will remain of the show in reruns is hard to say. Some stories won't play as well as others but with the current heading of the plot the show itself will prove to be a keeper. Buy this one for your collection. It will age well."
5,"Beginning of the end, but a great final Hurrah","As someone who is late to the BSG bandwagon, I have to say that it's sad to see such a great series coming to a close. While I was disappointed to see that season 4 would be split into 2 parts, you have to be grateful that we weren't made to wait a full year to get the season. The extras on the DVD's whet the pallate of anyone with even an inkling of wanting to see how BSG is going to wrap up, and I eagerly await it's return.My only complaint with Season 4.0 is that it includes Razor, which I'm sure the majority of us already own. However, if you've avoided or delayed yourself in picking up a copy of Razor, you'll get the director's cut included."
5,Best show on TV... still.,"If you haven't seen this show, start with the mini-series and don't miss a single episode. The quality has not slacked off with this latest season."
1,DON'T BUY THIS!!,Absolutley do not buy this. It is ridiculous that they release this box set without the final ten episodes of the season. All they had to do was wait threee months to deliver a proper box set. But they are trying to do nothing more than squeeze you for an extra $50. Season 4.0 $50 plus season 4.1 $50 equalls twice as much money as they made for realeasing season 3 in one complete season. Stand up for your rights not to be squeezed for more money during a recesion by the big movie studioes looking to supplument their lowered revenue. DON'T BUY THIS!!! If you must bargain for it on e-bay or buy it used in a few months when the price drops.
5,Raising the bar then exiting stage right,"I got to say like so many other people have posted BSG is by far one of the best SciFi shows out there. They have raised bar and then unfortunately they exit stage right. No they can't hang around for 11 years like some of the other SciFi show have then have 3 different spinoff's. Oh well. I just hope that the next show fills in the void some how. I miss Firefly, another good SciFi series."
4,Why January 6th?,"In the 21st Century television wasteland, which is largely populated by forgettable so-called ""reality"" shows and dime-a-dozen talk shows, Battlestar Galactica is one of the very few shows worth watching. While the show is great, some higher-up in the merchandising/marketing department apparently doesn't realize that Christmas is December 25th. It would make alot more sense to release the BG Season 4.0 DVD in November, rather than after the holidays are over in January."
1,Cheap product,"This is the cheapest set of DVD's I ever purchased. My ""new"" copy does not even have an episode list. And the disks are not marked, so I don't know which one is which. I don't even know if I got the whole season.Maybe I got a factory reject.I love the show, but this DVD product is the worst quality DVD in the world."
2,downhill ever since frakkin' New Caprica,"I also have to second those who wonder what the frak all the fuss is about. BSG *was* a very good show. . . until they did the whole New Caprica bit. Since then, it's gone steadily downhill. Silly storylines, storylines going nowhere, logical disconnects and nifty things just put aside (the Six in Baltar's head, for example . . . she was great and where is she now? Episodically present, at best.). Hello, we're supposed to shocked-SHOCKED that Helo led a mutiny? Starbuck was acting looney-toons. You'd have to be brain-dead NOT to mutiny. Silly stuff like that makes me grit my teeth.This series has been meandering and staggering toward some kind of conclusion for two years. About time it ended. Slouching toward Bethlehem indeed . . ."
5,One of the best seasons so far!,Season 4.0 was excellent and can hardly stand the wait for season 4.5. Curious to know how this will all end. Best sci-fi ever!
5,Consistently great TV,"The long odyssey of the remnants of the human race comes gradually to a head in the first part of BSG's final season. The wear and tear is starting to show in both ship and crew. Edgy, gritty as hell and operatic in scope, this sets the bar for outer space SF well into the troposphere. There may never be another series or movie to compare. I look forward to owning the entire series and watching it again, from start to finish. Amazing stuff.That said, I do think the producers are screwing us with this split season approach...."
2,Dumbest Ending Ever!,"I haven't seen the DVDs but I'm sure they are good. They always have good bonus footage and commentaries. I did see every episode on Sci-Fi network and I have to say it was definitely not the best season to say the least. I did like all the other seasons however.I won't ruin it of course but the ending was a huge let down to say the least. Up until then it was okay, maybe 3.5 stars but after that dumb ending I can give it no more than two. In fact after I saw that ending I wondered why I had wasted time watching this series in the first place. It was both dumb and predictible.If you are buying this as a gift for a BG fan then I think they will like it because the DVDs are great and include a lot more than just the episodes. I haven't seen these DVDs but if they are like the others then I think it's a great gift. Plus if they don't like the ending too then they don't have to feel bad about wasting their money to see it, they would have wasted yours instead lol."
1,No support for deployed troops,"I'm currently deployed to Iraq (and unable to catch my favorite show BG). It would be nice if Unbox could be used by troops to catch their favorite shows, but I guess DRM schemes are more important than the people serving over here."
3,B*G Nothing to Write Home About,"As a lifelong scifi fan, I can't quite figure out what all the fuss over Battlestar Galactica is about. It's ok given the dearth of good scifi out there, but not nearly as good as Firefly, Star Trek, or any number of other scifi shows. The plot is intriguing but the writing and acting is way to West Wing for my taste. It has zero sense of humor and the grim, grim, grim storyline needs to get over itself. The only reason I keep watching is that I saw a clip of Joss Whedon saying it was a great show. Hey, Joss: stop watching this drek and give us a new Whedon special!"
1,Save your money.,After iTunes stopped carrying the episodes I thought that UnBox was the only way to get them online. Wrong. Scifi is now showing the new episodes for free on their website. I bought the season on UnBox and feel completely ripped off.
1,unbox does not deliver,"Be very careful with unbox. It will take your money and delete the videos. I really wanted this service to work, but I guess I will have to buy a Slingbox now."
2,Half a Season; Half the Fulfillment,"I bought Season 4 and discovered I had only bought the first half of Season 4. This wasn't clear when I ordered. If I had known, I might have waited till all came out. I'm not looking forward to ending the shows halfway and then having to wait another 6-9 months."
1,If its any consolation...,"If it's any consolation, it is 50 cents cheaper than the 10 episodes for 2.5. Quick! Get your order in before they change their mind. ;-)They'll squeeze every last cent. All 20 episodes of Season 3 was only $10 more than the 10 episodes of 4.0 when comparing list price. People can wait for the end of the season to buy this. But like they did for 2.0/2.5, I don't think they will publish a full season 4 set; only the additional 10 episodes as the Season 4.5 release.The show is ranked 5 stars for me, but this marketing stuff gets a 1 star. However, I don't think they'll ever make it to the heights of merchandising and multiple releases as George Lucas's Star Wars series.... Enter Blu-ray... maybe after the conclusion of the series with season 4.5 release, they will start releasing it to Blu-ray. Should we wait?"
1,BOOOO!!!,I waited until they re-packaged seasons 2.0 and 2.5 into one bundle so I saved half the cost. That's what I'll do again for seasons 4.0 and 4.5 because I refuse to pay twice for a single product. I give this DVD a 1 star for having such a ridiculous price. People should avoid purchase of this joke.
1,I got the wrong show,"I got the wrong show, this isn't Bstar, it's In Plain Sight. Very Disappointing. Amazon needs to fix this."
4,"Half season only, includes Razor","Be warned that this is only half of Season 4. For some reason, after getting the hint with Season 3 and releasing it all in one box, Season 4 is being divided in two again. I didn't realize it until I finished watching the set-- I would have waited for the full season to be released before buying.This set also includes the Razor movie, so there's no need to buy it separately."
2,The first half of the final season - good or not?,"First of all, it really pisses me off considering I bought ""Battlestar Galactica: Razor"" on DVD when it first came out. Now if I wanted this season I had to buy it again! They no doubt did that on purpose to get more money out of loyal fans. [...] They did the same thing with the miniseries and the first season. Although I kind of understand that since many people might have not known about the miniseries and just bought the season, but ""Razor"" was not that important to the fourth season or to the series - it was good, but not important - unlike the miniseries.Now lets talk about the episodes themselves. ""Razor"" (not actually part of the season) was good and so was the first two episodes as well as the last two, but every other episode was crap. And why did they have to kill Cally off that way? That really pissed me off too. Not recommeded unless you are planning to buy season 4.5 as well."
5,Very Good,"These DVDs were in excellent condition, and met my expectations. I am very pleased with the purchase."
3,"Great show, Unbox service just OK","The aspect ratio is wrong on my 16x9 TV. Its widescreen, but it not right. Circles are slightly oval.Also, its only Dolby 2.0. Why? This show is produced and aired in 5.1. That's what I want.Oh well, it was easier than usenet!"
1,Learn a Lesson,"I refuse to purchase yet another half-season. I will absolutely buy this season when I can get the complete product. Writer's Strike is not an excuse to rip off the customer. Love the show, will continue to buy the show, but ONLY, in complete form. Merchandizing and marketing take a note, we will not stand for this. If you are further compounding the error by thinking you will get accurate ""ratings"" because of this exact methodology and the outrage it causes, let me be absolutely clear. I love the show, appreciate the actors, and enjoy the writing. Your corporate hatchet-men are killing what should be blockbuster sales."
2,Includes Razor!?!,"To all of you people complaining about those of us who low-rank this product due to the marketing/manufacturing, deal with it. I'm also PO'd at both the DVD manufacturer as well as with Amazon. Where on this product page does it say this is season 4.0 AND the Razor movie? I can deal with the split season. They did it once before. Fine. But I just opened my package and found the Razon disc inside. I got Razor a year ago when it came out and was totally hyped. There was no reason at all they needed to include it in this package. This is a crock.Blah blah blah, the show is still good, but the story is getting a little hokey. It's still a quality show, most people know this. That's why I'm focusing my review on the DVD product itself.Editing review to add that the Amazon page currently is displaying one of their Frequently Bought Together packages...Season 4.0 + Season 3 + RazorPrice for all three: $79.96Way to go, Amazon."
2,What?.....What?,"I haven't felt this let down since the ending of the Sopranos. Pissed away four years of great work in three episodes. The very least they could have done was hit the reset button and start the cycle over. My frustration, and I think I write for many viewers, is that after all of the cliff hangers, you look down and see a net. BIG DEAL!"
1,4.5 Space Opera - worse than season 3,"Season four started off great. Unfortunately, it turned intoa soap opera with too much dialog, no logic, and little action.There are flashbacks to characters lives. Its like watching Daysof Our Lives in space.I actually liked season 3, and the beginning of season 4 much better.That is not saying much.The ending is so bad. And their (writers) explanations for Kara, Baltar, and Caprica six feels like the writers were drunk at the time. They just slopped down any explanation they could.Don't waste your money.It is good for insomnia, however."
1,Wow. Not this bad since The Matrix Revolutions...,Wow. I watched this show from the miniseries on and I expected a _lot_ better. Like a previous reviewer stated... I want my money back!
1,Four bleddy years...,"In the interests of a spoiler-free review, all I will say is: I want my money back."
4,Final season,"I have enjoyed all the seasons of Battlestar Galactica, however I am finding this last season, 4, to be a little less enjoyable. It seems more disjointed in story lines, attempting to bring the various elements to a close. I still have a few episodes to see ... then I will summarize again.Overall, the production is fabulous!"
2,"Such promise, and such failure","This whole series had the chance to be great. The acting was fantastic, the cinematography brilliant, and the concept was solid. Then they mucked it up with all this ""destiny and prophecy"" junk. It was constricting and cliche-ridden when it could have been a breathtaking, adventurous cautionary tale. They showed a shocking lack of imagination, and the end product felt cobbled together, improvised, and shoddy."
5,Battlestar Galactica 4.0,"Being a big fan of the BG series, I found the first half of series 4 to be exciting and engrossing. I have not been watching the series on TV as I had been introduced to it on DVD and did not wish to ruin the storyline for myself. I find the references to Greek mythology and to the Old Testament to be fairly intriguing and hopefully suggestive of the final outcome...rather like a good detective story. I await with anticipation the final half of this series to be issued on DVD."
2,Not worth the price,I love the Sims 2 so I had to get the Christmas pack. Yes there are other holidays in here but they really could have put 5 times more content in here. You basically get one of every decoration and there aren't many yard decorations. I was disappointed with this. Basically if you want a Christmas neighborhood all the houses will have the same decorations. Honestly they needed 5 times more content.
3,sims2 holiday stuff,some of the x-mas items and decorations are a little strange....especially the painting and figurines of the santas.
3,It was ....ok.,"I purchased this game on Christmas Eve for $20 at the EA Online game store. (i digitally downloaded it) I do not have the Holiday base game, just the regular Sims 2.I was really confused, things on the cover of this game such as the stockings + reindeer, I can't find them! Their are also very many items in witch I have not seen during my gameplay. Just a note to yall: this is NOT an expansion pack, it is merely a 'stuff' pack. don't expect this to renew your gameplay for another year or so.PROS:*some cute clothes (i havnt found the elf costume yet, but the santa clause one was cute)*snowmen were a nice touch*cute christmas trees*items are practical, dosn't mess up original decor.*cute windows w/ snow on them*party favors: firecrackers, sparklers!CONS:*no snow! snow isn't a choice for terrain! whats a snowman without snow?!?*lights: you can't hang lights inside or outside if its on the same piece of wall that a window is at.thanks~"
2,A rip off,Sort of disappointing considering the high price. You really don't get very much for the cost you pay. The Sims 1 used to have Santa visit and the Sims 2 can't even manage that. You get very little except a few decorations (no lights in the window) and the Xmas Tree you download from Maxis. You can see EA is all about getting RICH and not delivering quality.
1,DO NOT BUY!,"I'm so mad that I bought this!It contributes NOTHING to the game but a few items that are basically useless!Not worth the money spent on this game.The items you get do not even make up the price of the game, grossly overpriced for the amount of items you get."
2,Eh...,"Save your money. It's not really worth it. While there are a few good new things, there isn't enough. They should have made this a complete holiday pack by adding New Years, Valentine's Day, St. Paddy's Day, Easter, 4th of July & well, you get the point...ALL of the holidays. Heck, even Groundhog's Day should have made this pack! I like the costumes & decorations, but I would love more of a variety. There just doesn't seem to be enough. And how about a dreidel? I mean really? Come on...lame...but it tries to be cute so I'm giving it 2 stars. And I left out cookies for Santa...cute."
2,not worth the money,"I bought this at a used bookstore rather than paying the Amazon price and I'm SO glad I did.PROSChristmas cookies bring Santa, and he'll leave a random item as a giftCONS95% of this collection is Christmas stuff. The rest is made up of a few Halloween items (and I literally mean 3 or 4).There are only a few strands of Christmas lights availableChristmas lights hang like any other wall art, so you can't decorate windows with lights or anything.There just isn't enough stuff (items) overall. Definitely not 31 dollars worth of stuff."
4,Sims Holiday is great!!,"Highly recommended; its one of the only expansions without some bug or annoying glitches. Its so much fun!!! And I love all of the new holiday decorations- it goes perfectly with my favorite expansion pack, Seasons. Pick this one!! :)"
3,Festive items but.....,"As in the Glamour Life Stuff pack & Family Fun Stuff pack this one doesn't give your Sims enough new items for the money. What you see on the cover of this 'Stuff' pack is basically what you get for the money. I ordered it from Amazon but, now I wish I would've waited for a Complete pack or just downloaded online. Granted tho, that the Christmas idea was a cute one. I just wish there were some more items to make this worth the bucks."
1,Sims 2 Happy Holiday Stuff,"If you purchased the Sims 2 Holiday Party Pack last Christmas in 2005 (or the Sims 2 Holiday Edition in 2005 which is the same thing except it also contains the base game), then you likely already have the content in this CD. The Sims 2 Happy Holiday Stuff (2006), seems to be a collection of the same items from the 2005 release. Check into it yourself first just to make sure you're not buying the same things twice."
3,A bit of a dissapointment,"As other reviewers have noted, you don't get a lot for the money. I was hoping that some of the content would be more interactive and was greatly dissapointed. I enjoy the decorative objects, but if I were to buy it again I would bargain shop a bit (I paid $20 at Meijer for it)."
3,It disappointed to me after installing it,"I did not like that only she brought objects to celebrate the celebrations. I disappointed much when finishing installing and that demanded the expansion of The 2 Sims Pets. On the other hand, as the CD cannot be registered, within my page Web in EA Games The Sims 2, it does not appear that I have this new CD"
3,7 out of 10 A Good Sims 2 Expansion,"Happy Holiday Stuff extras. However it's not necessary unless you're a big Sims 2 fan and enjoy the games Customization features such as building and decoration your own home.Holiday Stuff includes various extras such as Christmas Trees, Santa outfits, Hanukkah Decorations and more."
3,Must Wait Until Christmas,"This is a Christmas gift that was really requested. I hope they are not disappointed, since I am an early shopper and will not know if this works until December 24. This is the day we open gifts."
4,Got enough for the money...,"I got it thinking it would be very similiar to the apple ipod sock. it isn't. this sock is stretchy and fits over the ipod, the only downside is that the top of the sock is grey, and the bottom is really dark purple. But, for $0.98, i got what i paid for."
5,Smoke and Pit Cover,Very well satisfied. Product was what I required and as specified. It fit my Smoke and Pit perfectly. Delivery was faster then stated.Thank you
2,Not recommended,"The instructions are easy to follow, and it is a good reference book to find out the basics of reading music and playing chords. HOWEVER, it does not have enough lessons or songs for practicing. I finished the whole book but the only things I found useful from it were some basic hand positions. I bought two other piano books afterward and they are a lot better than this one.One thing I don't understand is that the instruction in the top and bottom sections on most pages are nearly identical. I didn't want to miss any thing so I read them all, and turned out it was a big waste of my time."
1,Accuracy in Description,"I ordered this book under the impression it was in ""GOOD"" condition, as stated in the description of condition, but when I received it, it had a broken binding and pages were starting to rip away. This is especially important in this type of book because it is for instructional piano and the book needs to be lying flat in order to practice. I think it is very important for you to stress the importance of accuracy in the description of the products your suppliers are offering."
5,Two thumbs up!,"Amazing the quality of this low cost LCD flat panel monitor: color, contrast resolution, etc. So good that I've just bought a second one!"
4,"Nice monitor, good price","First LCD. Makes a huge difference from my 12"" laptop screen! Nice resolution, easy install, limited but acceptable tilting action. As other reviews have said, you can't adjust the vertical position of the monitor but the tilt seems adequate for most uses. PC install using the installation cd did not execute automatically with my IBM laptop Win XP machine. However, it's easy to get the driver by searching on the cd or off the web."
1,ripped off,"I ordered this product as new product on Amazon.com, it stopped working 6 months later, I returned it to Samsung repair, turns out that there was no warrantee (after they originally said that it was). Tech for Less and Amazon wanted nothing to do with it. Basically I had to write off the monitor and take the hit, neither Amazon, Tech for Less, or Samsung, would take responsibility for it. I will have to buy a replacement. Customer service in all three of these companies couldn't have been worse. The warranty (3 years) posted on Amazon's website turned out to be useless and their customer service even worse."
3,Very average,"I have had this monitor for the last 18 months or so and it's just broken down. I play a lot of games and its performance was so-so - I'm no tech head, but 12ms response time isn't that great any more - and it's almost impossible to adjust. In short, it was OK while it lasted, but now it's broken..."
4,Good Quality at a Good Price,"Excellent, space saving, replacement for very good resolution CRT monitor that was failing. Easy to install on 3-4 year old Dell system. Has very good color, crisp images. Has a ""quality"" feel and good-looking design. Price was very good for an up to date flat screen from the top designer/manufacturer."
4,"Good CD, Okay Voice--","I've never had high regard for Dinah Shore's voice and bought this CD for just a couple of songs. 'Chantez, Chantez' carries me back to my childhood, hearing it on the radio. 'Dear Hearts', the same thing. The audio quality is good on here, the CD is not expensive, and if one is a Dinah Shore fan one could do worse in a selection on one CD."
4,School Counselors guidelines,This was a required text for school counseling. It is very informative. Includes guidance units as well as what to expect your position to be.
4,Doing good so far!,I had purchase this bottle and never really used it.Until..I got biten by a spider and I was sick so I had taken about like 3/pills for 2/days and went down to 2/days for about three days..It had taken whatever I had in me out and to be on the safe side Im still taking it for about another day..It really help with the infections and swelling..I didn't give it 5/stars because im still taking the pills..But so far good!
5,Greatly used in my health needs,"I use this product along with vitamin C and the illness is just kicked out. The sooner I catch it, the better the results are. I never let my self get low from DefensePlus. Highly recommend."
5,love this stuff for extra immune defense,"I have been using this for about 2 years when I am traveling or around others who have a cold or flu symptoms. I take extra C at the same time. I take multi-vitamins, probiotics & fish oil daily. This is just an extra immune booster when I need it. I don't take all the time. Nothing is a miracle drug, you still have to wash your hands and use common sense when you are around sick people...but this definitely helps me."
4,Non-Beginner Advanced Reference,"This title is for the schooled j2me coder. The material is rather advanced, and the topics covered involve programming you will only really see on the corporate level. If you have just got that phone from xxxxx- service provider, don't start here if you want to write a quick app or game. Instead, go to J2ME The Complete Reference from Osborne/McGraw Hill- this will prove more beneficial. I was able to gain knowledge of what my future held with Java Micro if I chose the path, and this book put everything into perspective. Thanks IBM ;)Hope this helps"
5,yummy,"Zony Mash successfully walks the line between serious, avant-tinged jazz and MMW style jam music. Honestly, I don't get into the latter, but I really love this album."
5,Great heavy metal from Sweden.,"After recieving this CD in the mail yesterday I can honestly say I am completely satisfied with this work. Lunar Strain is In Flames debut album and in my opinion is one of their best. Mikael Stanne of Dark Tranquillity is the singer. The melodies are catchy and there are a lot more folk music interludes. There are even female vocals. Subterranean is also included in this imported CD. This one sounds like a continuation of Lunar Strain. There are also two demo tracks ""Dead Eternity"" and ""The Inborn Lifeless"". As you know, these two songs appeared on The Jester Race. But these demo versions feature Henke Forss on vocals. Trust me, you are getting your money's worth on this CD. Don't pass it up."
2,someone is upset....,"after reading ""the vampire's heart"" I hoped for another good read from mark, but was ultimately disappointed with this novel for several reasons. The most immediate was the lack of realistic dialogue. Another was the high use of repetition, which almost made it hard to read in sections...and yes, people esp. teens do repeat themselves...but the reader doesn't need to be bored to death with it. Mark has done some other notable work, but ""someone"" appeared lifeless. And i'm still pondering if a person can go from loving one person to another so swiftly as noted in this book."
2,A great book -- if you're 14.,"This was little more than a teen romance novel. The dialogue was corny, the situations unrealistic and the characters one-dimensional. You'll read it in an hour -- and then you'll forget it immediately."
2,An improvement over his first book,"If nothing else, the slimmer page-count in this volume made it a much quicker read than his previous book ""The Soccer Field Is Empty."" The dialogue was still more than a little stilted, and some of the amazing deus ex machinas lead me to roll my eyes.As with his pervious novel, Mr. Roeder clearly has a great deal of affection for his characters and the idealized world they inhabit. But with any author attempting to publish his own work, the affection can be a bit of detriment.With that said, I do admire Mr. Roeder's chutzpah evidence in creating this world and sticking with it.Decent book for the beach or an airplane, but not high art."
5,another super book,"I can honestly say this is one of my favorite books. The book has multiple story lines and none of them leaves you bored. I thought the story was gripping all the way through. I felt what the main character was feeling whether it was scared, angry or happy.I also liked the co-characters of Jon, Nathan, Taylor, and Mark.This is a book that should not be missed."
3,A good-enough entry in the gay coming-of-age genre,"""Someone is Watching"" is a good but not great gay coming-of-age tale. It offers something a little different in the form of menace. Other than that, it is pretty standard fare. I recommend this book to gay coming-of-age genre fans. For readers new to this genre, or extremely serious about it, you should start elsewhere. Try ""Saints of Augustine"" or ""Out of the Pocket."""
2,Tedious,I skipped a lot of pages of tedious repetition and implausible story line. I wanted to like the character and see how the story resolves but remained disapponted.
5,Best DVD out there for beginners.,"I am not even a beginner, and I learned quite a bit about technique. The instruction is phenominal, both on the physical and mental aspects and especially the breathing.Thus, I am happy I bought this video. It was not especially physically challenging, but I felt that I gained insight into the practice. I also felt well balanced after completing this DVD.If you are a beginner, I wholeheartedly say you must purchase this video. If you are intermediate, you will still gain something."
4,Latex style-coats well,"I never acid-etched my concrete pool as they tell you to do when applying paint. But, this stuff applied well, evenly, and did exactly as was advertised: holds water. It's safe for fish, because I've had goldfish in there for over 6 months (and they haven't died!).Negative: It's not really a ""surf blue"", so much as a SKY BLUE. Buyers beware that this thing is like baby-blue bright, and when the sun hits it you'll be blinded. Surf blue should be a slightly darker tone to it (I know, I live next to the ocean and see the surf daily)."
5,Love this lotion,I saw this on sale and i'm glad that i bought this lotion it smells great the scent last a long time and it's good for my daughter's dry skin.
5,A fun. fun book for all ages whether you just read or do it!,"You'll never tire of thumbing through this book from time to time and trying some of the author's ""magic"" on yourself and/or your friends. It's the kind of book you'd buy as a gift for your child or grand-child--after you've read it for yourself first, of course! It's a ""keepsake"" sort of volume that will never grow tiresome."
4,Seems to help.,My husband has been using this produce more than I have and he's been dodging colds that our kiddo brings home from school. Seems help boost the immune system a bit.
2,This is Not the Freestyle I grew up on!,I have never heard this music back in the 80s when Freestyle was popular.I am very curious as to why this is called Freestyle.Maybe someone can come and add info to help.The names who made it seem to be from the right culture though.Have a good day.
4,Great CD,"This is a really good CD. I specially like the songs by La-Mour and W&E. Now all the songs are not as good, but over all this is a good buy. I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys classic freestyle music."
5,"Excellent CD, but where is Miss Norman?","First and foremost, I must say that Diva Battle stole the show. Her rendition of Mozart's ""Durch Zarlichkeit"" is absolutely astounding. Even if you are not a fan of the other singers, the CD is worth its price just to hear Miss Battle.I must say, I was quite disappointed when I noticed that Jessye Norman was not included in this compilation. She is the Supreme Diva!! If anyone should have been included, it should have been her. Perhaps they will come out with a CD entitled ""The Diva: Jessye Norman"", as that is the only way they could do her justice. She's in a league of her own.Buy the CD. You will not be disappointed."
3,didn't see result,"I didn't see much result, but I' ll still use it until it's gone. It smoothens skin and not greasy which I like."
1,Ultimate Body firming treatment - Does not work.,Have seen no results at all with this product. Have used it everyday usually twice a day. No difference in skin at all. Waste of money.
1,"If something sounds too good to be true, it probably is!","I put this on my stomach religiously for 2 weeks, morning and night. Didn't change a thing. I should have known better-there is no such thing as a quick fix!"
2,Didn't do anything for my skin,"I bought this in hopes of firming up lose skin on my stomach (post pregnancy and weight loss). It did nothing for me, except maybe moisturize the skin some.It has a somewhat strong citrus smell when you put it on, but goes away when it dries. It didn't feel greasey or stain my clothes.At least it was cheap, so I'm not out a lot of dough.The search is on..."
5,Cannot live without this,"I cannot live without this item. I use it after every shower, and even use it on my face. My skin is so incredibly soft and I am 37. It clears my acne."
5,....!,"If there were a modern day council of the remaining living martial arts masters, to decide which writings from antiquity up to the present time should be canonized into a martial artist's bible: This would be one of the first among the few works included from this century. That being said, Just read it, it may accelerate the progress of your practice exponentially."
2,"If you don't like heavy metal, keep looking!","This so-called ""Stylish"" remake of the classic ""Nosferatu"" adds a distracting soundtrack to a silent masterpiece. The film remains effective as a horror vehicle, but does not have the same impact as the original or the 1979 Klaus Kinski version. The price of this version is attractive, but proves the old proverb ""You get what you pay for."" If you like ""Type O Negative"", you'll enjoy this video. If not, spend a bit more and pick one of the other versions. Better yet, try BOTH of the other versions!"
3,It's okay,"I'm not really sure why this DVD was made, I like Type O and still wish they were still around, and of course I am a huge vampire fan. This just seemed kind of silly. It was interesting and all but find it cheap before shelling out some good money."
3,Great Movie,"Nosferatu should absolutely be respected for it's contribution to, and advancement of, the film industry and particularly horror movies. The film offers special effects that were cutting edge at the time and still maintain some of their power in creating terror and tension. I had reservations about watching Nosferatu. Since I love movies that make good use of sound, the idea of silent film didn't interest me. I had similar prejudices toward the special effects, cinematography, acting, etc. I figured Nosferatu was a classic for purely nostalgic reasons. I mean, how could anybody actually enjoy a movie that could have been shot by a seventeen-year-old with a crappy camera? How naive I was...Nosferatu is an exercise in brilliant film-making. Murnau's heavy investment on the look of the film pays off. The film is fun to watch. The acting is over the top, which is necessary to avoid constant cuts to dialog cards. The music is great, too. Chilling and expressive without being overbearing."
5,Enjoyed it thoroughly,"I found this DVD to be wonderful *because* of the music. I always wanted to see the Nosferatu movie, but once I heard the original music when I finally caught the movie on TV, I couldn't stomach watching because the music was so distracting. On a lark, I got this DVD because the soundtrack was new, and lo-n-behold, I loved it. The music was a wonderful, delightful enhancement that (as far as I am concerned) made the movie more than just watch-able, but thoroughly enjoyable.The music was set to the mood of the scenes, making emotion tangible and helping draw you into the plot of this wonderful classic.All in all, it's one of my favorite DVD's now and I watch it periodically just for the joy of it.If you have any doubts, rent it first, then buy it if you like it. I wouldn't want my collection to be without it. :)"
5,Great Boot,"I bought these for my husband for work boots. He had been buying other brands that were just falling apart and not worth it. We were spending more money in the long run to keep buying new boots. So, they might seem pricey, but they really are worth it! You are definetly getting your money's worth! And my husband has no problems with wearing them all day! He says they are very comfortable!!"
5,Still the best,Don't depend on 'generic' labels from eBay. For the best results use these glossy labels. You will not regret it.
4,A triumph for Ferri--and Giselle,"Key to any superior performance of Giselle is a ballerina who knows how to act, and Ferri's acting (and dancing) illuminates not only Giselle but the entire ballet, letting us believe this peasant girl could love, forgive and redeem her royal cad. Her partner is not quite up to her standard, especially in his dancing, though this does not undermine the spirit that she has instilled in the ballet. The music is splendidly played by La Scala's orchestra, and, in general, this Italian production demonstrates again that the quality of lightness is essential to the successful portrayal of this difficult ballet."
4,A Very Interesting Box,"There are some very funny and interesting items in the box. If you are a fan of Andy Warhol, you'll surely enjoy having it as one of you collections."
5,it's worth of money!!!,"I love this box. even my daughter was very interesting about the box. So, I can show Andy Warhol's work and explain to her so she can have the idea about the art."
3,This is a blast for the Warhol fan,"I just love this little collection of ""stuff"" from Andy Warhol, because that is what he was all about-- ""stuff!"" I have thought about framing some of the items inside, but it's fun to pull the box out once in a while and just look through it. It's a real glimpse into his goofy, eccentric life and the things that were important to him. I have his diaries and many of his books, too, but this is really fun to have."
5,Awesome,"I saw this at an urban outfitters store, and brought it a couple of days later. I have always had a fascination with the 1960s, and everything that came out during that decade, so I thought this was a cool thing for me to get. It contains, letters, postcards, a stamp, articles, a poster, a book explaining each item, and much more. Its fun to dig through it, once in a while. I would recommend this if you are a Warhol fan."
2,"Like Fame, This Pop Box is Interesting for Only 15 Minutes","If you're looking for something of substance about the life & artwork of Andy Warhol or even just a time capsule that captures some of the essence of the Silver Factory era, this isn't it. This ""Pop Box"" is really just an assortment of less-than-authentic looking reproductions of Warhol's personal correspondence & various other flashy gewgaws, all of whose novelty wears thin within seconds after viewing them. Maybe on an artistic level this collection might have worked if the publisher had made more of an effort in trying to make the contents look authentic rather than just settling for the cheesy looking knock-offs that we were presented with. On the other hand I do think this collection would make a nice introduction for youngsters (maybe combined with Lou Reed & John Cale's excellent Warhol tribute CD ""Songs for Drella"") who are just starting to learn about Andy Warhol and Pop Art, but that's about it."
3,"Cuts Great, but Poor Handling","Pro: The shears do a great job cutting through everything I've needed (plastic & paper bags, cardboard, etc.). They're definitely razor sharp, and come with a nice blade guard which I think is important.Con: The handles are flimsy...very soft rubber. They certainly are comfortable; big holes for the fingers, and of course very soft and plyable. However, they don't hold up under any sort of pressure (because of being too soft), and therefore probably will not be used much unless I can fashon some replacement handles."
3,No replacement parts,"We've had this shredder ~1.5 yrs - light use (credit card offers, cc receipts, cards). It worked fine, but the largest nylon gear inside stripped. Replacement would be rediculously easy, but replacement parts are not available.The shredder is fine, but I wouldn't purchase again for lack of service or replacement parts. I wager the gear that failed for me is 70% of all failures for this model."
1,Nothing Special,I bought this after reading all of the great reviews on the web but it is nothing special. I get much better results for my waves/curls with biosilk rock hard gelee. The BRHG is cheaper & I can find at CVS. I wish I had saved my money. I will use it but will not repurchase.
4,But It Is On Charly,There was a time when the only way to find this material was on Charly. That isn't the case anymore though this CD does have a few pieces which are uncommon. Then again Charly issues frequently sound less than optimal. Ya takes ya chances...
5,Rossini renaissance,"Recorded a year or so after Devia's impressive recital performance of La morte di Didone at Pesaro festival (available by Bongiovanni label), this first Rossini cantatas recital offers more insight in a composer whom we mostly associate with comic operas. And who is better qualified to conduct Rossini works than Chailly.Rossini's vocal writing in these pieces sounds more or less the same as in his complete operas and one could think these actually are scenes from operas but they're not. Devia is as great as in Pesaro and her voice is well captured by Decca's engineers. She uses a few different ornamentations which makes listening to the scena a new experience. In the cantata for Pio, the fine Pertusi, Kelly and Piccoli join in and with the help of the chorus, the result is sparkling.The libretto is included and it helps. I wasn't bowled over by Rossini's music on this recital but I'm pleased to have it in my collection."
4,Logo-mania,"""Symbols of America"" is the perfect book for owners of new businesses looking for the consumate symbol for their organization. Mr. Morgan tells brief histories of organization logos, trademarks, and emblems and how they were created. In logical chapters and sections this book is a must for trivia specialist, visual readers, and those looking to create the perfect ""image"" for their company."
5,Great tools for the job of fitness,"This tape series was enlightening and extremely useful. As a professional athlete, I found Bailey's understanding and approach to the facts about fitness outstanding, motivating and, above all, useful. He starts at the fundamental level and works his way up. This is a ""Fitness 101"" for anyone who wants to understand the way our body works with regards to metabolism, fitness, weightloss and nutrition. It was a breakthrough for me."
2,too much hype for so little result,"Tried these drop ins after having some results with them earlier. However, they do nothing for rust, iron, lime, etc but do smell good. Don't waster your money."
4,Ok,With three bathrooms to keep up the twin pack was a good value and the product lasted about 30 days
3,Vanish is what they do in about 2 weeks,I couldn't honestly tell if the toilet was any cleaner than normal after using these. Also they make my bathroom smell like a public bathroom. And they dont last very long. It seemed like every other day I was turning around and replacing them. We've stopped using them now because of those reasons but mainly because it's such a hassle to maintain.
1,didn't last very long,"Expectations are straight forward, keep the toilet clean, fresh smelling, and water blue for awhile. Seemed to keep things generally clean but didn't last very long. Little to no aroma which is fine. Probably would not buy again because I had to change so frequently that they would have to be super cheap to make it a good value."
1,Utter garbage,"I can't believe anyone is still trying to put out the lies that NBC and their b.s. ""whitepaper"" did against Jim Garrison. Garrison was and is a hero, he's the only one who brought a prosecution in the murder of the president of the United States. Shaw was CIA, it was admitted after his death, under oath, by Richard Helms. Victor Marchetti, executive secretary for the CIA director, said in 1975 that the CIA was actively giving assitance to Shaw and his lawyers, and had a big hand in the NBC hatchett job on Garrison. Shaw knew Oswald, and Ferrie, was photographed with both and was in Clinton with both. No one was drugged, a witness voluntarily was given sodium pentathol, there was no ""bribes"", but there were attempts to set up Garrison to discredit him. Lambert is an out and out liar, and this book is garbage. I'd rate it a 0 but that option isn't offered."
1,Lambert Misleads the Public,"This book may as well be thrown into my garbage can. I have studied Jim Garrison for years now, and Ms. Lambert's work has been the worst I have seen yet. I believe that she has been reading alot of the nonsense that was published in between 1967-1969 by such reporters as James Phelan, Rosemary James, along with James Kirkwood.The material that she uses has been misquoted, misconstrued, and overall, alot of the things printed is just fiction. Patricia, I think you would have been better off writing about Monica Lewinski, and the sexual ordeals of Larry Flint. Your book is distorted, and a fabrication from start to finish."
1,Horrible!,"I agree with everything said by those who gave this book a rating of 2 and lower. How could anybody believe this slanderous [stuff]! Besides, even the most unlearned viewer of ""JFK"" knows that it was based LOOSELY on Jim Garrison's memoirs. Oliver Stone stands on his own, and he doth surely ""taketh and giveth away."" So quit trying to slam ""JFK""! This book belongs with ... like ""The Dark Side of Camelot,"" for everything written in this book is presented by Patricia Lambert as final and uncontested which it is certainly not! I can't help but be sorry for those who buy into such a loose study on an excellent film, an excellent mystery, and an excellent true-to-life courtroom drama. Sheesh!"
1,Wake up!,"Why is Clay Shaw portrayed as a ""victim"" in this book? Richard Helms admitted under oath in 1979, that Clay Shaw had been a contract-agent for the CIA. Clay Shaw denied this before, during and after the famous trial. In consequence; he was nothing but a perjurer. He also denied knowing David Ferrie, even though there are pictures of them together.I cannot believe that many Americans still think Lee Harvey Oswald was the man behind the assassination. I urge people to buy Oliver Stones ""JFK"" Special Edition Directors Cut on DVD. This DVD containes a bonus disc with a lot of additional information, gathered the past ten years."
1,Complete ...!,"This book should be renamed ""ALL LIES"". As the years pass, Jim Garrison has been proven to be right in all aspects of his investigation. Read Jim Garrison's ""On The Trail Of The Assasins"" or Mark Lane's ""Plausible Denial"" for the TRUE facts about the investigation. DON'T WASTE YOU'RE TIME OR MONEY ON THIS BOOK OF COMPLETE LIES AND NON-FACTUAL INFORMATION. Jim Garrison has always been bashed by the media and government, so of course now that he's no longer with us, people like Patricia Lambert are just cashing in on making up lies and fake information on Jim. STAY AWAY FROM THIS BOOK!!!!!!"
1,False Witness,The only thing I have to say concerning this book is it is a joke the writer should research the facts ( the real facts) concerning the JFK case.
1,PATRICIA HAS NO CLUE JUST ONE MORE PERSON WITH HEREYESCLOSED,GARRISONS CASE WAS RIGHT ON AND PROVED THAT OUR OWN SYSTEM KILLED ITS LEADER BASED ON ACTUAL FACTS . THIS IS A SAD WAY TO LIVE IN COUNTRY THAT LIES AND KILLS FOR POWER.
5,A Breath Of Fresh Air,"After book after book and a movie about how Clay Shaw just sliped through Jim Garrison's fingers, this book was a revelation. Lambert sheds light on the facts that Garrison supporters ignored or glossed over. One of finest non-fiction works I have ever read."
1,avoid this anti-Garrison debacle from Patricia Lambert BILLINGS,"While I am not a huge fan of Jim Garrison or his case, he is to be commended for the focus he gave to Ferrie, Banister, Oswald, New Orleans, the Z film, and, ultimately, the ""JFK"" movie/ his own books/ the JFK Act/ the ARRB. In fact, James DiEugenio, William Davy, and Joan Mellen have written quality books defending his side of things.Back in the mid-1970's, Patricia Lambert, then known as Patricia BILLINGS (ANY RELATION TO RICHARD BILLINGS OF HSCA FAME???), she was an assisitant to David Lifton on ""Best Evidence"" *and* wrote two (technically, three) heavy-hitting articles on the Secret Service's failures in Dallas (which I duly acknowledge in my work on the Secret Service). Shades of Dan Moldea and a few others, she has know changed her stripes.What else can I say? AVOID.vince palamara"
4,"good stand, legs need help","This is a handy stand, I've used them for LCD monitors, laptop docking stations,and even CRT monitors and other heavier stuff. The cord management cutouts at the rear can help manage cables and cords. As others have mentioned, it's not to be moved easily, because the leg sections fall apart... I put a piece of electrical tape where the sections slide together and it's a much better hold now; but I dock a star for having to do this. I have a few of these, and continue to buy them for monitor risers at work, they're the best thing at this economical price point."
2,Flimsy product,"Doesn't really work much better than the old phone book I was using before I got this. Cheap Plastic all around, pieces fall apart easily. As mentioned by others the parts don't screw together. I suppose it works but save yourself the money and skip this product, whatever book your using as a doorstop will work just as well."
5,Great for the office,"This is one of the best monitor stands in the market (for my companies needs). The price is excellent and super affordable, and you can adjust the height. Working in an office you have people of all kinds, all heights, and all preferences. This monitor stand is universal in that it works for everyone and I thinks that's the best part. I was orignally hestitant about purchasing this product for the first time because of the two tone color, I wasn't sure if it would look cheap or not. After purchasing the product I was the least bit bothered with the color, it blends in just fine with everyones desk. I've already purchased about 20 of these and will continue to purchase more as needed for the office"
5,no surprise,"It should come as no surprise that Monkeyluv, as with all of Sapolsky's books, is a masterpiece. There is no better science writer of our day."
2,Disappointed,"The book reads more like a polemic than a social history. Some of the material is interesting, but the author's analysis is weak, and his conclusions are frequently not supported by the facts. The book for the most part is trite and devoid of acute insight. I was hoping to find an even handed account of this tragic conflict, and was truly disappointed."
3,Not Balanced,"While LaGuardia gets his 'facts' right, his slant is biased and he excludes the facts that don't support his point of view.He is disrespectful of the Jewish religion pointing out what he considers it's short comings with derision. For instance: He treats as 'fact' the location of shrines in the middle east of Muslim and Christians and 'myth' or 'belief' when referring to Jewish holy places. When discussing women's issues, he carefully shows women's exclusion in Judiasm and never mentions any corresponding exclusion when discussing the practices of other people. Finally, when he describes the culture of Israel, his attitude is one of disrespect.He's entitled to feel however he likes, but he is not 'balanced' not evenhanded in this book. It would be a shame if readers used this book to gain an understanding of what the situation is in the Middle East."
1,Ponderous and slanted,I regret the hours I spent trying to read this book. It is tedious reading and not that informative. It is slanted to the Arab view of things over and over. His descriptions of actual places not accurate and I can make the comparisons because I have seen with them with my own eyes. His recounting of the history is more biased. I am sorry I bought the book and I am throwing it away instead of putting it in one of my bookcases as I usually do.
2,Biased genetic studies?,"Author La Guardia mentions how the Lemba of Africa have the Jewish gene. Fine! But when he deals (in several pages mind you)with the Falashas (also of Africa) he never mentions that genetic studies have positively shown these Jews NOT to be descended from the 12 Tribes of Israel despite the Falashas's longtime rep for possibly being a Lost Tribe of Israel which, again, has now been 100% disproven through genetic studies."
1,Worse Product Ever Purchased Anywhere,Item advertised as heavy duty with felt backing. I have trash bags that are more heavy duty. Item had no felt backing as is advertised. Item was ordered for Brinkmann smoker and it fit like a sausage skin that was about 4 inches too short even though item is advertised to fit all. You would be better off buying Wal-mart heavy duty leaf bags than this item. Either I got the wrong item or the other reviews were outright lies. Brinkmann should delete name off cover and Amazon should discontinue offering item for sale. Only good thing about ordering this product is that I got a refund from Amazon without a hassle. Selling this product should be discontinued and at least placing a disclaimer on ad.
2,Brinkmann Smoke'N Jacket,"If you are purchasing this item because you think it has a felt underling, don't bother. That is a lie! I have had a Brinkmann cover in the past that had a felt underling, but this one DOES NOT!!! Don't waste your money if that is your reason for buying. The only thing it is better than is a garbage bag!"
4,Just a basic thin plastic cover,"For the price, a good little basic smoker cover.Black plastic material with no liner and it has the name BRINKMANN in black lettering on a white blocked out area (about 8 inches in length by 3 inches in height) on the front of the cover.The cover does not go all of the way to the bottom of the smoker because they did not make allowance for the handle on the top of the lid.The material feels like (and smells like)the plastic that a blow up beach ball is made of.Does the job for under $11.00 (including shipping) but wouldn't pay any more for it."
4,We've got you covered!,"Bought a replacement Brinkmann smoker so I decided to buy a cover for it this time. On my old smoker I used a black garbage bag and it worked fine. Just the right size. I bought this one because it looked like a heavier gauge then the black garbage bag, it looks better than the bag too. While the vinyl isnt as heavy as I would like, it seems to do a good job. I guess only time will tell. Nice item though and it looks sharp."
5,"A good, quality product.",Not much to say other than this cover looks like it could outlast the smoker under it.I have no place to set this smoker out of the weather so it needs a cover.
3,Time will tell.,"This is the cover sold by the manufacturer for this smoker, but it is just a sheet of vinyl without lining or reinforcement. Similar covers for my grill have not lasted long in the weather. Will need to get a couple years down the road to assess it durability."
3,"Unspectacular, solid","This cover is a nice product and adequately protects my smoker... it has the Brinkmann logo so it has that going for it as well. It doesn't seem to be the most sturdy cover, but it has gotten the job done through some hot weather and some wicked storms. It is a nice product, but there may be other alternatives out there. All in all, it's not a bad buy."
4,"Covers OK, but pretty thin.",Covers the smoker OK. I wish it was a little thicker material though. Not sure how long it will hold up.
2,Cheap and flimsy,"I thought that being the same brand as the smoker, this thing would fit like a glove and never come off.. But during our last storm, there was some wind and it blew the thing right off... When I opened tha package, it felt like some cheap rubber plastic (kind of the the free windbreaker they gave you at sports games.. You might as well buy a generic.."
3,smoker cover,This cover was not exactly what I had hoped it would be. It does not seem as sturdy as other covers I have purchased in the past.
4,Great Smoker,"This is a relatively good smoker. It works well. The instructions were easy to follow and the cooking times listed are surprisingly accurate. However, the smoker is very cumbersome. You cannot pick it up and move it all it once but instead have to move each piece separately. Still, it worth the price."
2,Not remotely as advertised but is a workable substitution for the price,Sometimes things are too good to be true. Loved the description and price of this product but it is neither heavy duty nor is it felt lined. This is a very workable vinyl cover for the Brinkman Smokers and is a fair deal for the price but not what was described.
2,Electric Smoker Cover,"This cover is really ""cheap"" - I am not sure how long it will last simply because it is a thin plastic and I really wish it was about 3"" longer so that it went all the way to the ground. The opening where you feed the heating element through is still exposed. There was no other choice of covers from Brinkman so when this one shoots craps I will buy an off brand and try it."
3,So-so,"""Earth Sun Moon"" could not help but be a little bit of a disappointment after a great album like ""Express."" Love and Rockets return to the more acoustic-dominated sound of the dark and magnificent ""Seventh Dream Of Teenage Heaven"" (my favorite L&R album) but with less satisfying results. ""Mirror People"" and ""No New Tale To Tell"" were the obvious - well, only - choices for singles. Along with these two, I liked ""Waiting For The Flood,"" the somber ""The Light"" and the soothing title cut, but the rest seems uninspired and falls a little flat. ""Earth Sun Moon"" is not a terrible album by any means, but it is not an especially good one, either. Still, it was much better than the subsequent self-titled effort."
5,You never know what to expect from Love and Rockets...,"I really liked this album, but I must say, their previous album Seventh Dream Of Teenage Heaven (1985) is my favorite. Their album Hot Trip to Las Vegas was a big disappoitment. The problem with these guys is that they are inconsistent from album to album. Only Seventh Dream Of Teenage Heaven and Earth Sun and Moon manage to offer compatibility in style. Chances are, if you like Earth Sun and Moon, you'll appreciate Seventh Dream Of Teenage Heaven. But, I no longer trust them. They were at their best in the 80s."
2,I only liked one song..,"The song,'Everybody Wants to go to Heaven'.. It's a very beautiful song, and reminds me of Gospel music."
5,One of the best albums of the '80s?,"This is a masterpiece. Even the order of the songs is perfect...it's one of those albums you can listen to all the way through, over and over. It's also a very ""visual"" album: a lot of the songs evoke great visual imagery with what sound like sort of musical sound-effects. There are lots of little details thrown in, giving the sense that a lot of TLC went into making it."
5,A True and Enduring Classic!,"This is one of those albums, along with my collection of Bauhaus and Peter Murphy, that has never really been out of circulation in my collection. The songs and melodies are so well crafted and so classic that they have never become old. I find myself playing many songs from this album in my car at deafening volumes for younger friends unexposed to Love and Rockets... they're usually hooked, and it's not a wonder that they are. ""No New Tale to Tell,"" ""The Light,"" ""Rainbird,"" and ""We're Waiting for the Flood"" really stay with you."
4,One of Love and Rockets best,"This is one of the band's best albums. While it contains the popular hit ""No New Tale to Tell"" (a staple of 120 Minutes early years), it also has the Beatlesque ""Rain Bird"", the light shuffle of ""Lazy"" (which brings to my mind the ""Singin in the Rain"" sequence of A Clockwork Orange for some strange reason), the experimental jazz of ""The Telephone is Empty"". ""Everybody Wants to Go to Heaven"" (easily the album's best number) is a catchy pop ballad which examines one's inner spiritual beliefs. ""Here on Earth"" covers a similar philosophical theme, but neither song preaches, allowing the listener to come to his/her own conclusions. ""Mirror People"" is a whirling little psychedelic pop dance number, reprised on the last track in a slow version. ""waiting for the flood"" has one of those catchy, sing along verses. The album flows seemlessly from moody Goth-pop, acoustic aural landscapes, to all-out rockers without sounding forced."
3,Not bad.,"Nancy Boutilier, On the Eighth Day Adam Slept Alone (Black Sparrow, 2000)Nancy Boutilier's second collection of poetry, like its older sister a Lambda Literary Award finalist, is good but inconsistent. This is, of course, the case with the majority of poetry books, and thus is certainly no reason not to pick it up; you're not wading through much swine at all to get to the pearls.Divided into ten sections, On the Eighth Day Adam Slept Alone is sometimes surprising, sometimes predictable, sometimes sweet, sometimes sarcastic, and usually technically sound. There are some times when she wanders off into vagueness, but in a single-author collection of over 200 pages, that's to be expected.Worth picking up if you run across it in the used bookstore. **"
3,Too Pricey,"If you upgrade to LED, you must get a glass lens elsewise you will have a melt lens to gaffaw at and brag about, not. Get a glass lens. You got to take the hit on the price. I did. Alas."
1,Is anyone else sick of RIP OFF SHIPPING,1 cent for item and $5.00 for shipping the item that would fit in an envelope for .44 cents. Screw this company and all like it doing business as they do here at Amazon.
5,Glass lens,"Works great, never had any problems. After all it's a glass lens, it had no scratches, it wasn't cracked and it fit."
1,Million Pieces,"I just received this product. (I think!) It was in a million pieces in the bottom of the packaging box! The glass seems to be paper thin and VERY delicate. Given the cost, it's not worth returning."
2,Not Sure Why I Bought This,"I was hoping that, in keeping with their rugged design, Maglite would have made this out of tempered glass. It's not. My dog decided to help my install it and bumped it out of my hand. It rolled on carpet, very slowly, about a foot and bumped into the body of the flashlight, and chipped. Nice.... Not only is it not tempered, what ever glass it is made out of is extremely brittle. Maybe it's a Fluorite lens. ;)"
1,Not tempered; cracked immediately. Junk.,"Buy a few lottery tickets instead. This is not tempered glass. It will crack as soon as you bump your Maglite against any hard surface. Just buy a couple Maglite brand plastic lenses for when they get scratched up.And obviously don't buy this glass lens if you are a peace officer or security gaurd; a crack messes up the light beam, which could risk your safety.Amazon should stop carrying this glass lens, with all the one star reviews on cracking. If your's cracked too just add another brief one star review. Maybe they eventually get flagged and read by Amazon, if enough one-stars are posted.The Maglite AA glass lenses that Amazon is selling are probably less prone to cracking since they are much smaller, but it may be the same cheap glass. I bought one of those for my AA Mini Maglite and it hasn't broken. But then I also put on one of the rubber sleeves from the Mini Maglite accessory kit for when it gets bumped, so that may have helped."
5,The Empire Speed Level,"I install framed art of all sizes. I was given two very used Empire Speed Levels ( #450-24 & # 460-36 ) both gold in color. I don't know how old they are but it really speeds up the process of picture hanging. I'd hate to be without them. As I said, these are used and the numbers and lines are starting to wear off. That would be my only complaint. Hopefully, they've corrected this problem with the 2 new ones I'm ordering."
4,Clothesdrop,"this was a pretty good cd the best songs on this disc areclothes drop, ready fir di ride, repent, shut up and dance, gone with angels"
5,Great service!,Service was all I could ask for. The book came prompty and was in good condition. I am HAPPY!!!
4,A Good one!,"Well done, Charles Stanley. I love this man's sincerity. He gives the glory to God, where it should go. I won't watch half the people on TV, because I have doubts about them. Not this guy. The discussing of the ""enemy"" and his work, is a topic that should be discussed, as is done here. It is real force in this world, and therefore we need to be on the lookout for the ugly work of the enemy. This will give you some help to do just that. Very Good book."
3,So-So salt shaker,"I love the look ofr this salt shaker, but the sea salt runs out of the bottom because the holes are too large. What a shame."
4,Really nice!,"the only think i didn't like is a white post-it on the back, that i can't remove that's covering some lines of the description.the rest is perfect. TNX."
4,Excellent product,"As I sit here with my arm in a cast I am dictating this review using the Dragon software. It installed easily. The orientation was well worth it. The program works, very, very well. I went off and got an aftermarket headset, which I preferred over the ones that came free with the software, but what do you expect for free? All in all great product that I would recommend highly."
2,It sort of works,"G'day,I bought DNS 8 Standard to use mainly on trips so I could keep a diary of the trips.When I tried it, the voice recognition was so-so.The worst part was that after about 3 pages the ""file"" fills up and you have to begin a new one.Now maybe there is a way around this, but I and no one else will be able to find out from Nuance. Their customer [dis]service is down at the bottom of the Marianas Trench. [I could make reference to whale droppings, but that wouldn't be polite.]I emailed them about this and was told to call for an answer. However, that would be my one and only free call.I really think, Nuance needs competition.Hello there Microsoft!"
2,pc-requirement seems false,"I think that the Version 8 pc-RAM requirement that the manufacturer Nuance has published is false on webpage <http://www.amazon.com/ScanSoft-Dragon-Naturally-Speaking-Standard/dp/system-requirements/B00030096W/ref=noref/102-1894406-6370552?ie=UTF8&n=229534&s=software>: it says that a pc with ""256 MB RAM"" is sufficient; but i could not get the product to be useful, even after much trying, some tantilizing results, and much optimizing and training of the product by me. Then I accidentally discovered a seemingly contradictory requirement stated inside the software: ""(256 mb FREE minimum)"" (capitals added)."
1,Doesn't support digital voice recorder,Wish I had known this software only does voice and does not support a digital voice recorder. I would have purchased the preferred edition.
1,Ripp-Off,"1)It's accuracy rate is so low , one finger typing is more efficient.2)No tech support , no response to e-mails.3)Try to register this software and see how far you get.4)Their return policy is worthless , they just ignore you.Someone should contact the B.B.B. in the relevant area and make life difficult for them. It's a hundred buck ripoff."
3,"mike doesn't work, tech support is pricey","Out of the box the microphone isn't recognized although Windows simple recorder recognizes it. I tried contacting support but you have to fill out a huge form of info, and they also want about ten bucks to answer one email question, even after you've paid a ton of money for the program. Given that this is something that definitely doesn't work in the program, since windows see the mike, I can't see spending ten bucks to get an answer that will probably not be the answer so I'll have to spend another ten bucks to clarify things.I really think first time users with an installation problem should have Some sort of one-time free tech support. These guys are too greedy, but I found the same problem with other Scansoft products."
1,dragon naturally speaking,do not buy this program. it doesn't install and any trouble shooting requires a credit card payment.
5,Dragon Naturally Speaking is ASSUME....once you get past the training,The best naturally Speaking software on the market. I have tried two other products that claim they do the same as Dragon but do not....they have made it easy once you get past the training lessons. I didnt know it even works for selling on Ebay which I am most thankful for. This product is really for my roommate because I was skeptical it was going to work as well as it did. Now I use it as well even though I am a fast accurate typist. BRAVO...Scansoft for developing this product.
2,Maybe its my accent,It took a long time to calibrate this software and even then it often got things wrong. Potentially only for bland North American accents
4,A great source for Native American poetry,"This book, organized by geography, is a good source of Native American songs and chants. The reader will gain insight into the Native American cultures represented herein through their songs and chants. Some are short, simplistic and straightforward in meaning. Others are long and filled with metaphor. Most of the songs and chants are about life events such as birth, marriage, death, traveling, and rituals."
4,Metropolitan Records,I think this cd is awesome. I think they put a lot of effort into making this cd. All of the songs on here are worth listening to. I didn't have to skip over any because I didn't like it. I highly recommend this cd to anyone who likes dance/house music.
1,Far from perfect!,These mousepads have the letters printed backwards. Take a close look at the picture.
5,Excellent book,This book was excellent for my studies. I found everything I needed to know on the subject of national cultures.
1,Valuable? - Perhaps for somebody who has never had a real eye for other cultures,"Hofstede's work was and is not really helpful; perhaps fascinating for those who deal with the issues from the comfortable space of their warm home of office in a western country.For all who want to get a fundamental insight to understanding espec. Asian behavior and cultural differences, I highly recommend to start with: ""The Geography of Thought : How Asians and Westerners Think Differently...and Why -- by Richard Nisbett"".That's the stuff that will bring you where Hofstede could never dream to be."
5,"Great book, a little dated","This book is inspirational and faith-building. You have to keep in mind, however, that it was written 30+ years ago. However, many of its prinicles are timeless and applicable for today."
5,Mike is spot on in this book.,"Mike Murdock was spot on when he wrote this book. I have lived my life as a Christian through the principles he outlines, (without reading his book) and God taught them to me, the same as God taught them to Mike. This book is a quick read, but heavy duty in it's impact. A lot of misinformation is published about the so called ""prosperity teaching"", but God wants to release us to fulfill the potential he placed within us, and it's not a little one. We must learn to hear, trust, and obey God when it comes to money and things. God wants to release us from greed, fear, and hording to be able to let God use us as seed sowers, givers, helpers, and blessers. This is not just so we can get rich, but so that we will have more to give, and so that God can use us more. Being a rich man is not a sin. Most of the patriarchs in the Bible were rich. The more riches you have the more you can give to help others. It's the Love of Money that is the sin."
2,Not Very Detail,"This DVD just covers few shapes like Square, Rectangle, Triangular Prism, Cube, Octagon . They never touched the Angles or sides of these shapes nor volume or perimeter etc. It worth only $5 not more than that."
5,"Ignore the rating, this is a balancing act","I haven't read the book yet but I feel compelled to balance out ""a reader"" who offers only one star and asserts that ""misinformation abounds"" by stating that Bork ""misstates the legal issue surrounding the case"".Do you know what ""abounds"" means? One example in 176 pages hardly counts.I might add the reviewer never actually says what Bork has got wrong. I trust that most prospective readers are smart enough to ignore this kind of drivel from an obviously partisan individual and make their own minds up."
1,Don't bother,"I needed this for a research project and couldn't use a library copy as I mark up books I use for reference. Bork is Bork and screed is screed, enough said."
3,where's the goods?,"I bought this cuz I loved their music on DDR. But ""So Many Men"" is the only song of it's kind on this CD. Overall the tracks are more r&b than dancey. I suggest you get their self-titled one over this."
1,Supermax Super Dissapointing!!!!,"I agree with the previous posters, this has to be one of the worst designed toys from Hot Wheels yet! My son just received this for his 4th birthday and every button or feature on it has frustrated him (he's screaming at it as I'm writing this!). He was so excited when he got it, as he lives for anything Hot Wheels. He is determined to get everything to work on the truck but I can tell that he is going to get so frustrated with it that he'll end up breaking it. Save yourself the money and your child the heartbreak, don't buy this toy!"
2,Definitely not worth the money,"My 5 1/2 year old twin boys each received this item as a gift recently. They both broke within 10 minutes of opening. The trailer will not stay attached to the truck and caused much frustration for my boys. It is very hard to lower trailer. Every time they went to lift the truck and trailer off the ground they ended up lifting the trailer and not being able to lower it again. The door on the back of the trailer was also hard for them to manuever. After two frustrating days of play, we threw away the trailers and just left the truck for the kids to play with."
1,Dissapointed,This was a very pretty charm until the antiqueing wore off. Now it's a ulgy charm................Not for everyday wear.
5,An excellent career overview of Sammy Kaye's biggest hits,"This compact disc offers an excellent one-disc overview of Sammy Kaye's biggest hits. Sammy Kaye had many hits in the 1940s and early 1950s, and this disc includes many of his memorable recordings, including ""Daddy"", ""Harbor Lights"" and ""The Old Lamp-Lighter."" Some wonderfully sentimental songs of the late 1940s are also included -- ""Apple Blossom Wedding"", ""Serenade of the Bells"" and ""Roses"". The sound quality is excellent. This is a first-rate disc and the only disappointment is that Collector's Choice has not yet issued Volume 2!"
2,NO INSTRUMENTALS,"I always liked Sammy Kaye and when I got this CD, o was hoping there'd be instrumentals; but noooo, all the songs are vocal numbers. The best songs are ""Penny Serenade"" (v-Jimmy Brown), ""I Left My Heart At The Stage Door Canteen"" (v-Don Cornell), ""That's My Desire"" (v-Don Cornell and the Kaydets), ""There Goes That Song Again"" (v-Nancy Norman), ""Careless Hands"" (v-Don Cornell and the Kaydets), ""Room Full Of Roses"" (v-Don Cornell and the Kaydets), ""It Isn't Fair"" (v-Don Cornell) and ""Harbor Lights"" (v-Tony Alamo and the Kaydets). This CD could've been better, but the next Sammy Kaye will have instrumentals. I hope!"
2,Good for the price,"This was the first time hearing these guys and it came up because people who have bought albums that I have, they have also bought this cd as well. If I would have paid $15.99 or however much it retails as I would have said it wasnt worth it, but I only paid $3 for it so I would say im satisfied with that. The cd is put together weird I would say. All the songs are mashed together to make one long song for instance, track number 4 is like 15 minutes but it is 3 seperate songs together kind of like a tape I guess. I dont know but it makes it harder to scroll from track to track thats for sure. I would say about 3 of the songs on this album are tight, but the best track on the album is ""Emcees Come, And Emcees Go"""
4,"Detroit4life, I'm down with cha","For those of you who don't know, AWOL has been putting it down for years, this album""Detroit4Life"" is a excellent lp. peace to dj Homicide (RIP) this goes beyond the odds and shows that the detroit artists has what it takes to be a major force to deal with. I love the song where they diss MC Breed, on ""When the smoke clears"". Pazaz saids: ""I call you JC Breed cause your making pennies"", that was nice. The only thing I can see that needs improving on this out cold LP is that more focus on issues surrounding the metro area, and more props givin' to the Artist who layed it down before detroit got reconized, AWOL peace to ya and keep coming. OUT. Michael Lee CEO of Prolific Records 1998"
1,ick,I listened to Dr. Oz and I put it in some seltzer water and sweetner and it was absolutely awful.
2,Kola Nut Fizzled,I heard about this product from Dr. Oz who suggested it for making a natural cola soda drink. I found that the flavor did not produce the desired result and the alcohol in it gave it an off taste. I was really disappointed because I had hoped to be able to use it instead of the store bought cola drinks. I don't plan to buy it again.
2,"Okay, but not for everyone","According to Mary Hale her diet therapy for CFIDS will help everyone but I don't agree. It is very strict and punishing and according to her you must eliminate any kind of fruit from your diet because it contains sugar. According to her sugar is a no-no for people with CFIDS but that has not been proven beyond a shadow of a doubt. No two people who have CFIDS are the same and she makes it sound like everyone is. Just remember this, check with your doctor before starting any kind of diet."
4,The book was better than I expected,"After receiving the book this morning, and thinking how much the guy on the cover reminded me of Lou Diamond Phillips, I had the fast-paced story finished before the day was done. Pretty good book."
3,"The action was good, but.......","I would've liked to see more in the line of ""romance"" between the ex-lovers/teammates, Daniel Darkeye and Raven Blackheart. Still, it was one of those ""fun"" books that didn't take itself too serious. Sort of the way action films don't take themselves too serious yet are fun anyway. A worthy read, even though it could've definitely been better regarding the ""rekindling of love"" between the lead characters. Maybe if there is a second book of ""adventures"" we'll see some of that."
4,A Fun Book,"This is a fun book. The writing is reminiscent of William Shatner's ""TekWar"" series. It is heavy on action and a good time romp in Sci-Fi land that could make for a fun Sci-Fi Channel movie. Based on the descriptions (which are fun and violently graphic) I could see someone like Rikki Lee Travolta playing Darkeye with that kind of Bruce Campbell tongue-in-cheek dry humor he has. Plus the cover totally looks like him."
1,worst book ever written,"I can't believe how bad this book is. I'm speechless. Horrible writing, story filled with cliches."
2,I could've used that hour or two doing something better,"In general, I like books that are entertaining, and they don't need to be too deep. This one, however, wasn't particularly entertaining to me. The basic concept of producing the story via log-enteries was interesting, but that was about it. There was no explanation of how a computer virus might ""upload"" itself into humans, which made this really hard to believe. While there was plenty of action (indeed, the whole book was essentially one big fire fight), I could've used at least a little thought, interesting ideas, or something else. All-in-all, I found this very disappointing."
3,Not bad,"If you like watching action movies or playing video games like I do, then you'll probably like this book."
5,I thought the book was cool!,"Just like watching a movie or something...a lot more ""visual"" than anything I've read before. Almost like a graphic novel!"
1,Great Companion Piece to ANY COMIC BOOK,"This book is perfect for you if you like books that go great with comic books. I didn't read at all until I found this book in a pile of oily rags near my stepmom's apartment. This book goes great with comic books, and if you like those you'll love this non-graphic novel. It's about a man with a dark eye who hunts cybers throughout the galaxy. When he falls in love with the boss's daughter he has to escape and still try and keep his identity a secret! Meanwhile, the Earth is under attack. A really great read!"
1,broke within year,"Added an electric heater to a new walk in closet. This worked fine when we installed, but not even one year later, the thermostat is broken (in very light use). The electrician bypassed the thermostat to see if it or heater was at issue; heater works fine whenever you flip the circuit breaker. Thermostat: nada."
2,"Functions, but too big of temp swings.","This mechanical based thermostat has a huge temperature swing to it. It wired in-line wity my electric heater (high voltage - 240v, 2 powered lines in and out) easily. When I think it should turn it, I have to physically tap the dial and the heater turns on. When I think it should be done, I have to physically tap it again to turn off. Temp swings from below 68F to above 72F without me intervening with a tap. Looking for another thermostat now that is digital based."
1,poor design of a docking station,"the USB connector does not stick out far enough for the phone to make a connection, I had to break open the case to fix it just to get it to work. very cheap design."
1,"poor quality, barely works","Got to find a way to return this. The unit looks good but is built poorly. The usb connector is not mounted to the base so the first thing that happens when you connect the phone is that the usb connector gets pushed into the base and doesn't connect. After fishing it out, I managed to hold it in place so I could connect the phone. The sync with the PC works fine but charging is a bust. Don't know if they use the wrong pwr supply or it's just mis-wired. The phone doesn't charge - it just gets hot!boo hiss"
5,"If you like popular 60's folk, this fantasic for listening",This albume set is a must for folk fans and in particular Christy Minstrel fans. My only regret is they didn't include 'Gotta Quit Kickin' My Dog Around' and 'Company Of Cowards'.
4,Webb pops the top on a tall boy can o' whupass,"This great collection of short films is straight out of the swampadellic world of the Rockabilly South. Webb creates a meta-hero who is part poet, part Joe Friday, and part Rock n Roll god. Too bad this little one hour gem is so hard to find these days. Webb has an active cult following, and this video serves as either an introduction to his twisted character, or a celebration that extends his great live performances into your living room. Every rock artist should make short film like these!"
5,"If you don't think the Corn Flicks are # 1, u r full of # 2","The corn flicks are awesome. It's a shame it's not in print and on DVD. This movie has the best one liners of any movie period. I find myself working them (or revisions of them) into casual conversation nearly every day. Things like, ""My career is a wax string hanging from a cat's a..."" and ""It's bad enough that he bad-mouthed poor old dead Elvis, but he had to do it while blowing pot smoke in my face.""There are two Web Wilder, Private Eye stories and one short that Web's director did without web. The short is halarious... a little bit about an old lady from Mississippi (I think) who suffers from the ""old nasty disease."" There's nothing quite like them that I know of."
2,"what is good is not original, what is original is no good","Eh, whatever. I do not understand the hype. This looks like a freshman film students first attempt. It isnt funny, or clever, or well acted, or in focus much. Horror Hayride is a long tedious chore to sit through. In short, these shorts are BORING!!! Nothing happens, people talk and say nothing, Webb mumbles alot. The Dragnet comparrison is unwarranted because Dragnet had a STORY, and there aint no story here. The DVD (bootleg?) has the video for Human Cannonball, which is the only thing worth a repeat viewing. Peope wonder why Webb never made it big...this explains why, his songs and his flicks aint no demned good. Skip this one"
4,Counter Height Dining,"This is a beautiful dining set, It is made with a very sturdy wood. The problem areas were the chairs, they were difficult to assemble for many reasons and some of the legs were not flush. All in all this is a beautiful set. You will need two people to help stand this table upright after you assemble the legs because it is extremely heavy.I will look to this company for other items in the future."
4,Very good and very spicy,"These are great noodles. However, the same product is made in both Korea and California. The two versions have very different ingredients, the Korean version is vegetarian while this one from california is not."
2,"""Expensive Soup""","I received (1) 4.2 oz package of Shin Ramyun soup. Looks like the cost was $4.99, That's over a $1 per oz. The bad part is that it was also ""Out of Date"" last June 28th! I know Amazon is not to blame as I have never had this happen before. I was disapointed.R L Whyle"
5,My favorite fairy tale book!!,"This book is awesome! It was my favorite fairy tale book when I was a girl. I love the art work in it! I still have my orignal one from 1974. It was the only thing from my childhood I kept. I bought a new one for my 3 yr old twin boy and girl. I also bought one for my nephew too. They love looking at the pictures and listening to the stories. Some of the fairy tales are for older kids, but we still enjoy reading it."
2,China-printed edition much poorer than original 1970's version,"This particular edition was recently printed in China, and the illustrations are very poor, versus the former edition printed in the early 1970's. Recommended you pay a few more dollars and obtain the vastly superior earlier edition. We'll send this one to Salvation Army and reorder elsewhere."
4,Not a bad little CD,"Altho it is missing a few great Oi and reggae tunes that could have been added to it, it is quite a good little CD, with a few songs I had never heard. And the new ones from Judge Dread were well worth it. If you know any skinheads, and don't know what to get them for Christmas, birthdays etc. this tin would be a good bet. The post cards that come with this tin make it even more worth it. Only other thing that could have made it better would be some liner notes, but hey we can't all be perfect."
5,Need More!!,"Took me forever to find these 2 years ago, now I need to order more and no longer available :( Please where oh where can I purchase these, they are super! So much safer for your pets neck, gives padding for those bumps on the road....."

4,Look at this in the Mirror sideways,"This was my second exposure to the tumultuously talented trip, and seems to be a great progression piece - incorporating new sounds and use of a DJ to expand their musical expression. I followed this up with TONIC, which is also fairly outstanding, and if you listen to them back-to-back, the power and percision that MMW plays with is so self-assured on both releases.If you are thinking about this as a first foray into MMW, don't hesistate. Buy and listen, you won't be disappoint -- then you can get on to such releases as THE DROPPER."
4,"2 parts Organ, Bass & Drums, 1 part DJ & 1 part funk","MMW has done it again. The consistantly funky trio has delivered infectious grooves with a splash of weirdness, courtesy DJ Logic (where did he get some some of those samples?). For an extra bonus, slip on the headphoes are take an extra good listen to some of the open jams...classic! This album marks a happy return to well balanced and interesting MMW music...a nice comeback from the over-organed 'Shack Man'. Overall, an excellent listen and great buy for the collection."
4,This is a jammin disk,this cd is a mellow yet a times intense musical adventure! the piano playing and bass playing are wonderful and are very tantalizing and mezmorizing. when listening to this cd you find yourself lost in a jazzy/bluesy maze of pure musical fun!
2,They've done better.,"I'm a big MMW fan, but I'm disappointed w/Combustication. Lots of long, loose, free-flowing vamps and jams, but they don't seem to go anywhere or amount to anything. Addition of a DJ is the only thing that keeps it interesting. Where is the gut-bucket funk of Shack-Man? Where are those brilliant, wacky organ solos? Not here."
3,Not my favorite,"MMW are great stuff, but this release didn't do ""it"" for me. I prefer _Friday Afternoon in the Universe_ has much more solid grooves, and _It's a Jungle in Here_ is much funkier."
2,"If new to MMW, go wit' Fri. Afternoon in Univ. or Shackman","MMW put on the greatest live show BAR NONE! This said, I've always bought their studio recordings with a grain of salt and enjoyed them like methodone to a smack junky, but this latest is WACK, bring back the JAZZ, lose the DJ and be like stella in jamaica. I'll still go see 'em any chance I git, 'cause they ARE DA BEST!!"
4,Not just for Phish-philes!,"MMW continue to inovate their style on their latest album. The addition of DJ Logic on three of the tracks is also a plus. Is is Jazz? Who cares the real issue is that it's a quality album well worth the $. If you like MMW I urge you to get it, if you need a break from the Billboard syndrome I say broaden your horizons with Combustication."
3,hmmm... not bad at all,"There really are some good things going on here. I see most of the bad reviews here are from jazz odyssey types hoping MMW kicks out more extended jams, but that is really not happening too much here. Granted during some of the later moments on the album I'm thinking one of MMW is going to say ""Derek Smalls, He wrote this,"" but it manages to stay pretty tight. Purest MMW folks balk at the dj, but it makes the album for me. I think there is much more potential here, though. Maybe the remix version is what I am looking for."
1,Where Have They Gone?,"When I first started listening to MMW, I loved the music that was in the groove. I listen to this album and all I hear is a groove without any music. In this album the set up the same undulating grooves that they have in their past albums, but they don't go anywhere with them. John Medeski is one of the most talented pianist I have ever heard, yet any mediocre keyboardist could play most of the stuff on this album. I'll admit that I'm being a little harsh when I only give them one star, but when I know what this excellent band is capable of, they deserve no more. If you want to hear a real album, listen to thier new album ""Tonic"". It will blow you away."
2,"fuzz toned organ, pretty boring","I have heard alot about this group, but this record just is not that interesting musically. I know that MMW have some other fine albums, but i just can't listen to this one for too long. Too bad. Maybe next time."
2,Don't see what the fuss is all about,"Trying to stretch my musical tastes, and liking jazz on the whole, I tried this group and this CD, as Amazon selected this an essential recording....I wouldn't have labelled it so. Going to resell this soon. No matter how many listens, I am unimpressed.I like music, meaning chord structures that permit melody, sensible counterpoint, and harmonies however abstract...but this effort is generally lacking. To me its a little like Pat Metheny's ""The Way Up"" (which I own and listen to very occasionally)...someone might appreciate it for what it tries to do (stretch the concepts of music and jazz) and for the occasional tunefulness, but its not a ""must listen"".I wonder if Martin, Medeski or Wood have any Frank Zappa albums. If not, they could learn a little about jazz creativity from ""Jazz From Hell"", also an album that I don't and won't own."
4,Goodman at his more commercial best,"This CD represents the Goodman band at one of its' peak periods with superb arrangements, with BG solos at a relentless pace - try ""Scarecrow"" or ""Airmail Special"" for starters. Mel Powell was a genius, his piano style(""The Earl"" for example) and arrangements were very advanced for the time, reflected in the style and looseness of the section phrasing which nevertheless remained disciplined. This is a very different sound from the 1936-39 band of a few years earlier,less jazz-oriented, but a really swinging outfit. Recommended........"
5,He got it right.,"Max Alexander ran a big risk with his book ""Man Bites Log"". Having recently moved to Maine from ""Outastate"", his comments on the locals and their scene could have alienated him beyond the pale.As one of his subjects in this work, I was apprehensive, to say the least, when the book came out. Instead, I found a totally honest and somewhat funny approach to the life up here in the woods. Max captured the flavor and feel of our community, warts and all, and as a good reporter, he got it right. His comments on the actual events surrounding our neighbors are refreshing and honest. Even if you don't agree with his political views, he lays it all out as it is, and none of this is made up. Life can be hard but the humor he finds in these events is precious to those of us who lived through it all.I look forward to the sequel!I highly recommend this book, especially if you are contemplating moving to the woods."
5,this is a good love sone to delicate to your love one,"This song is so deep. It tells me exactly what I have been through. I always enjoy listening to her song whenever I'm in love or misses someone. I hope that there would be more copy of her single song, "" You'll Be My Future"", so I can purchase it and give it to all of my friends to own one of her copy."
1,Disappointing,"They don't show you in the pics of this product that they carved a large signature in black from some chef on the front of these high quality, beautiful mills. I got the pepper and salt mill and they both have it. It is beyond tacky. I should return these it's so hideous. Also, the carved signature is a different size on the salt mill. Why'd they do it? Other than that, this mill is of the highest quality and made in the USA. I'm keeping it for that but I had to wrap black electrical tape around it to hide this garish detail."
1,Received peppermill twice instead of salt mill,I received a peppermill instead of a salt mill. I re-ordered the salt mill and received again a peppermill instead of a salt mill. They were wrapped in a bag that indicated that they were a salt mill.Amazon was very good about me returning both for a refund. I would've loved to have the salt mill; but it was just not in the cards.
3,"Good, but not great","The story starts out well enough but soon becomes a mass of coincidences and a travelogue. The book moved quickly and sense of place was excellent. However, I never really had a sense of Eve's character and even less for the supporting characters. She's tough, she's capable of taking care of herself, lots of people die around her, but I wasn't involved enough to really care. So, while I thought it was good, it was far from great."
4,Raw Unleashed,"the last guy didn't know what he was talking about. Don't listen to him. If you like raw, primative, old-school NY hardcore punk from way back in the day, then this is for you. When I say NY hardcore, I'm not talking about 90's era, metal-hardcore crossover music... I'm talking about early 80's, unpolished, NY street punk hardcore. If you favor Agnostic Front's One Voice album (from their more metal oriented era), then maybe this CD might not be for you. But if you liked their United Blood ep (at the end of the Last Warning live CD), or the Victim In Pain ep, then chances are, you might dig this one."
1,"Very cheap looking, not at all like the photograph","The metal portions of the earrings are a very cheap-looking yellow, not at all like the photograph. I bought them for a present, and had to buy something else."
4,Good history of SWL and DX publications and clubs.,"Lots of details on DX clubs and magazines of the twenties and thirties. No theory or technical history. More a social history of the lure of long distance ""DXing"" on the Short waves and the Broadcast Band in the early years.For what it is, it's a great read."
3,What kind of soundtrack doesn't include all the music?,"Petite Cossette is some of Yuki Kajiura's most interesting work. Dark, mysterious, suspensful, it has it all. However, they did not include Ballad on the CD, and it is one of the most beautiful and important songs in the show, hence the removal of two stars."
4,Bella !,"Good beats and melodies. If you like old-school freestyle check out LIL' SUZY's ""We'd Always Be Together"". ELISSA sounds sweet too. Not totally amazing, but this cd is a keeper."
3,Leaks out of the box.,"The tent is roomy but it leaked from the seams all along the floor and wall union. I had to seal the seams, have not tried again since. I also had a bit of a strugle with the initial set up of the first two poles. Overall its decent for the price.JC."
2,Jumamji is in the middle kind of book between good and bad.,Jumamji is not that good of a book. It`s not as exciting as the movie.It`s kind of a boring book. It doesn`t have the hunter or the poisonous flowers or even the stampede or the policeman like the movie does. It`s not the best I`ve ever read.The only good part about it is the pictures. They are great.
3,Jumanji,Jumanji is an exhilarating book. Itis a fiction book and fiction books are better than nonficiton because when somebody tells you the truth it`s not fun. Another reason I liked Jumanji is because Chris Van Allsburg writes pretty good books and his pictures are breathtaking.
3,Jumanji,This book is about two kids who find a game. They forget to read the instructions and find themselves in trouble. I would recommend this book to a person who is not interested in chapter books. This book leads into an adventure.
2,look carefully,"Look carefully when ordering this. I needed Jumanji for a class and I thought this was it, but it's a book based on the MOVIE not the way the book was originally written. If you really love the movie and want a book based on it, then get it but if you want the original work, move on."
3,Not the best for Kindle Fire,"While the Jumanji is a great story, and the illustrations still look great on the Kindle Fire display, the text is too small. Even with text-pop up. I have no problem with the book, just the way it is displayed on Kindle. I would stick with the hard copy on this one."
3,"Original, dark fantasy story","This story, about the havoc created by animals released by a game that children find, has been made into a popular movie. I think most of the people who watch the movie are unaware that this book existed first. My Mom always found it a bit disturbing though, and didn't like reading it to us. There is a distinct impression that the game is evil, or at least not interested in the people's well being. At the very least, it is creepy. So, I'd recommend that parents who are concerned about such things read it to themselves first, but I really think that kids enjoy the story, perhaps because of the hint of evil will. After all, good triumphs, so in that sense, this is a traditional type of story, even though the subject is quite original."
5,Classic,"Not just a great story, but the artwork is, of course, brilliant. Van Allsburg really has a gift. Love this book."
1,A disappointment,This headset has been the worst of the three I have owned. The sound quality is pathetic. The other two were cheaper - I bought this only thinking that it would fit nicely and won't keep dropping out. Even that purpose wasn't solved because somehow the earglove design is such that it digs into the ear when worn and is cumbersome.
1,Samsung A500 and Body Glove Earglove pro headset combo,"I have a Samsung A500 mobile phone.Pros: easy to ear, not bulky and ear piece that fit inside the earCons: sounds like I was talking through a tincanWhile using this phone and headset together - it sounded like I was talking through a tin can. I tried calling cell phones and normal phones and received the same feedback. I don't know how it would function through another mobile or cordless phone."
2,Adequate but filled with junk,"The Casa Loma Orchestra could swing. A great arranger and a fine leader made some exquisite music. On this collection, on a few selections, they do just that.But there are many tame vocals on here, softer sounding songs with a non-descript vocalist who inspires little admiration. There's a reason you don't (or at least I don't) know Kenny Sargent (and some of the other vocalists listed in the notes but not identified with their performaces): they aren't very good. They range from blah to downright dreadful: The Fable of the Rose and Would'st I but Kiss Thy Hand, Oh Babe, two songs that go so wrong you wonder how a good arranger could listen and feel pleased.Well, tastes change, and what sounded cool in the Thirties sometimes sounds awful. If these ever sounded good, they no longer do.Some good swing, when the singers stay away, but even at a budget price, this leaves much to be desired."
3,RHONY,"I love the RHONY, however, since Bethanny and Jill have left, it's missing something. Cindy, no disrespect brings nothing to the table."
3,Despicable and Delicious,"As far as reality TV goes, and as far as the Real Housewives franchise is concerned, the NYC gals are the easiest to watch and dissect. I highly recommend watching the show in conjunction with Gawker's recaps, as they take the reality of the bickering, backbiting, and bitchiness to new levels of zombies and robots. Sometimes it's hard to watch how incredibly awful these women are. But not so hard that I can't stop watching. Unlike the bitches in NJ and OC, who are just gross and never put out any vain-gloriously disgustingly terrible music videos. Crackerjacks, I'm looking at you. Money don't buy you class, indeed."
1,I hope it will get better with Jill and Kelly gone!,"I am very happy that MEMEMEJILL is gone..her insecurity was borderline sociopath. Kelly was an a waste of air (really) If Bravo had not done away these two. i wouldn't/couldn't have watched next season. I will tolerate Sonja (duh, I'm pretty Sonja Morgan, treat me special) I will tolerate her ONLY for this season. Hoping Bravo will be done with her soon and give the viewers of this show what thewy have been asking for..although firing Jill was THE best thing they could have did!..we need some new REAL people on this series... I like Ramona, she has a long going marriage and actually has morals..hope they keep her until the end..we will seee..."
5,Don't miss out! Hot Body always delivers!!,Those of you who have grown up with Hot Body videos know exactly what to expect. Beautiful women in a softcore adult dvd. Full frontal and even closeups. The sad thing is that Hot Body is no longer producing new dvd's or VHS tapes and the prices are actually starting to rise. Check out ebay for some ridiculous bidding on Hot Body VHS tapes. When you find dvd's for less than $17 snatch them up. There aren't many out there and 10th Anniversary Contest is definitely one to grab.
2,"A book for specially interested people, like me...","This book does not deserve a good rating. 2 stars is perhaps to harsh, but it is actually not well written at all. - On the other side I don't regret that I bought it. Because it contains a lot of information and opinions with regards to high speed and high alltitude flight from this Golden Age Of Aviation. It was of historical value for me to get a feeling of this periode. - But it seems that Scott Crossfield was pressed by a publisher to write for two audiences, and one of the ""audiences"" may have been the housewife of the late fifthies. (I soon discovered that I had to browse through the first 100 or 150 pages of the book.) - If Scott Crossfield had sat down today to rewrite the story, I believe it could have become a great aviation book."
3,Not A Bad Publication,"The previous reviewer gave this publication an unfair review. I work in a ""no kill"" shelter and many, many people do not know about sticky tape, covered litter boxes, etc. The articles are written so everyone can read and understand them, and contain a great deal of useful information. Also, not all shelters are ""kill"" shelters. One just has to make a few phone calls or jump on the web to find them."
2,"Okay, but I wouldn't renew my subscription","This magazine is okay, but like a previous reviewer said, it often states the obvious. It does not have very many ""hard-edged"" articles. It is often too ""matter of fact"", and too careful not to make judgments. It never makes recommendations you couldn't guess yourself, and always tells you to ask your vet before doing anything beyond common sense. Even when it cannot make recommendations without examination of the cat, it does not fully explain all of the possibilities and their consequences for your cat -- it just says ""see your vet"". It intentionally avoids mentioning products by brand, to avoid the appearance of endorsement, even if there might be something good (or bad) to say about a particular product.I think ""Catnip"" is better."
4,Review of A Stitch in Time,"This is an extremely lively and readable account of changes in the U.S. apparel industry. It challenges the prevailing assumption that the industry is doomed to move offshore in its entirety. The authors argue persuasively that there will be a continuing need for apparel production in the U.S. by firms that cooperate more closely with retailers, and meet the demand for timely production. In addition, the authors present a fascinating history of the industry and a wonderfully detailed discussion of its changing technology. This book is useful to those interested specifically in the apparel industry, but also as a case study of how new information technologies are reshaping U.S. industries more generally."
1,The Purchasing Handbook: A Guide for the Purchasing and Supply Professional,it't not what I expected contents
5,V5 IQ air filter,"The price is the same as what I would have paid at my local supplier but I saved on not having to drive 1 hour each way to pick the item up. The product is the geniune article, just what I wanted. It came fast and in good condition. Will definately order again."
3,Experience speaks,"This book gives practical understanding of the issues that can side track your ministry fund raising. Some of it is so true it will make you laugh. If you have a parachurch ministry, get the book. It's not a fund raising handbook. More ""shop-talk"" you need to hear."
5,Sprite-like Energy Kicker,"I despise coffee. I gag anytime I get too close. This is the BEST of ANY Energy Drink I've ever had. Monster tastes too much like carbonated juice, not sure why they went that way, its gross. Red Bull is good but you have to be in the mood for it (unique taste like wine). I stock it in the garage anyway just in case. BAWLS is always everywhere. I stock it at home, the office, my car. I've been drinking about 2 a day for almost 2 years now and the taste does not get stale. Its like a soda, but with an extra kick of caffeine and guarana. I highly recommend. Its also very fun to say ""oh no, my bawls"" or ""so you like holding my bawls, ay?"
5,non-offensive energy drink,"Bawls is not the most effective energy drink, but it is certainly one of the better tasting ones as it does not leave any lingering aftertastes like most energy drinks. For caffeine addicts Bawls does nothing, but for the average person it will give you the boost you need without the harsh taste that is synonymous with energy drinks."
3,Tastes good but didn't give me the buzz I was expecting...,"It tastes good, almost like Cream Soda, but it didn't give me the buzz that I expect from energy drinks. I could take this one or leave it..."
4,"Good product, bad shipping.","Love my Bawls, I'd give them 5/5. My rating is 4/5 because the case had come completely apart inside the amazon box, which had little more than a few pieces of paper to protect my Bawls from bouncing around inside their sac.. er, I mean box. As a result, my Bawls were badly bruised, dented, deformed, and I'm not happy about that. Fortunately, none of the cans had actually been punctured inside the box, or else I would be really, really pissed at amazon.com for the first time ever.Thanks for shipping my Bawls Amazon, but next time give them adequate support and padding... -_-Also, I'd order sugar free Bawls if they were available."
1,This stuff is a total waste,"I usually buy RockStar energy drink but after reading all the great reviews about bawls, I thought I would give this stuff a chance. Bad idea !! This stuff had a nice smooth taste mainly cause it was plain old cream soda. It didn't work at all. I was seriously able to drink three cans in a row wait an hour to see if it would work but end up falling right to sleep. This stuff is a total waste of money, if you need energy , get some RockStar. This was utter crap !!!!!!"
5,"Awesome, must have",This book is awesome. Covers everything from basic waterflow and setup through animal interactions and suggestions. Lots to be learned from both novice and experienced.
2,A Big Disapiontment,"I was really looking forward to reading this book, but half way through I was still waiting for it to kick off. Unfourtunatly it didn't, the book is very slow, and the ending was quite poor. I don't think i'll be reading any of her other books, not impressed at all."
3,"Okay, but there are better books available","This is an okay book that has a lot of interesting information. However, there are better books available for those who want to know what real spirituality is all about. For example, ""The Disappearance of the Universe"" by Gary Renard really captures the spirit of The Gospel of Thomas, and gives an exciting vision of the early days of the Disciple's attempt to give the true message of Jesus before it was lost. I don't have anything against this Belienet Guide, but they could certainly do more to bring people the passion behind true spirituality, as opposed to what is usually (and tedpidly) passing for spirituality in today's marketplace."
4,silence = death,"When I first read some reviews of this book, I thought maybe Garden had taken on too many subjects for one novel. Reading it, however, I started to think that its themes are unified and that it is showing a whole system of the ways people are silenced by oppressive groups. The closet takes many forms, and the kids' inability to speak about who they are - for fear of being physically hurt - is mirrored in the censoring of information about sex and the censoring of commentary about the censorship itself. The novel is thought-provoking about social issues as well as moving in its portrayal of individuals finding their voices. If I'm picky, I could say that some of the dialogue sounded too written to me, and I really dislike the book's cover. But I read it in a few hours, and I feel richer for it. I am going to use it in my YA Literature class."
2,Sub-par Irish Enthusiasm,"I gave it a chance but Rhythm of the Dance turned out to be nothing more than another ""...of the Dance"" clone. The production looks like it was put on by high school or college students without any real direction or sense of what really entertains an audience. There's an underlying bit of potential but it's never harnessed in this show. Talent in the show? Yes, but it's like having a '59 Corvette that never leaves the garage. By the time the credits roll, you're left wanting more."
2,Okay but I've seen better,"This show was okay, it wasn't bad but it wasn't spectacular. It's okay for one watch at least, but don't expect the same caliber of Riverdance or Lord of the Dance. I think it was probably the ""budget"" look and the lighting but what really irked me was this: when I go to see an irish dance show, I go to see the dancers, NOT the musicians. To me, they showed too much of the musicians during the dance routines. The dancers would be dancing and the camera would show close ups of the musicians while you're missing out on the dancing action. They had some numbers that focused on the musicians only so I didn't see the need to show them profusely throughout the dancing numbers. All in all it was ok but not the best I've ever seen. I would say 2 out of 5."
4,Addison Spear's review of a fairly decent book.,"Real Time is a pretty straightforward, surprisingly gritty tale of a bomb, and how it explodes into the lives of several different people all searching for understanding. The style takes some adjusting, reading like Jack Bauer's diary and taking a somewhat detached stand on violence and morality. This is a novel perfect for someone looking for an uncomplicated format with an interwoven plot that reads as effective, but not preachy.Personally, I found it a bit difficult to be accessible at first, but overall it developed into what felt like a raw look into the violence that plays a role in these character's lives, and the reflection of violence in our own lives. An unblinking yet cautionary tale, after one gets settled into the book, it becomes very difficult to put down. I read it in one sitting."
3,"interesting topic, not very well-written","Sir Edmund Backhouse was a strange and very unappealing Englishman who lived in China for decades and lied to everyone, about everything. This is not enough to merit a 300-page book given Trevor-Roper's writing style, which lacks fluidity. There's no narrative flow during much of the book, and the rather dotty way in which it is organized does not help. In spite of the fact that the awful Backhouse should be an interesting subject, the reader's attention frequently wanders. Someone should have taken this book firmly in hand and edited it. Trevor-Roper's The Invention of Scotland was much easier to read, probably because it was edited by someone else."
4,Great entertainmaent,This one is a page turner. Defferent from the other type of writing that I enjoy. Helen and her husband make the northern woods of Minnesotta come to life.Warren
1,Terrible quality,"There are many pages where illustrations should be that are just spattered with dots, making half of this book completely worthless. You're better finding a PDF version online."
1,I know I am supposed to revere Bridgman - - - BUT... !!!,"I have had this book for forty years now. I was told as a young artist that this was THE book which would show me the way. I did find the way, my way anyway, but this book had nothing to do with it. In art circles there are certain names which it is taboo to speak critically about. Do not attempt to give this book less than five stars if you are within 50 blocks of the Art Student's League. I cannot tell you how many times I have been told ""this is the greatest work on anatomy bar none! Likely the greatest work on anything !!!"" What abject nonsense. I don't get it. I am forty years along now, and I just do not get why this is a good book for anyone's purpose regarding artistic anatomy. It is no more than an intro, and at that a VERY POOR one! It has nothing to do with Brigman's talent or his ingenuity. These seem just some of his notes on the subject anyway. It is no Grand work. One star. That is that! Still and all - maybe it's just me."
3,Okay,The print in the book is VERY light and is hard to read and draw from but it worked for my class.
1,Don't buy this one,"I would strongly advise the buyer to purchase this book from a different seller/publisher (no where in this book is a publisher even mentioned....). It has writing in it (hihglighted phrases, ect.), a good deal of the text is unreadable, and many of the illustrations are incoherent. Basicaly it looks like someone poorly photocopied their personal book, or printed it from a PDF on a printer that was running out of ink, and put a fancy cover on it-which need i even mentione is not even Bridgman's work.."
3,Its what I expected,"In reality, this book didn't teach me anything I didn't know already. The illustrations may be handy for someone who hasn't had much experience with body-mechanics, bending, joints, etc. This book was neither outstanding nor worthless, thus my bland 3 star review..."
2,hmmm,"I haven't actually read the book fully yet, but as an (beginning) artist I was more interested in the illustrations anyway. I was shocked to see the awful quality of the illustrations in this book. Some are allright but most are either very faint, with very ugly and confusing lines, like very quick sketches with a piece of charcoal. And they all look like they were printed on my antique black and white inkjet printer. Okay so the book is cheap, but that's no excuse for image quality this bad.I gave it two stars since I'm sure the information on anatomy is good reference and you might get something out of some of the images despite the quality."
1,"Poor Drawings, Poor Printing, Save Your Money","I bought 16 different Anatomy Drawing books and this is the only one that I actually felt compelled to give away. When the other people say the drawings are faded and sketchy that is an understatement. This is not a good book to learn by and it was not very effective in the design approach. Your much better off with some Dynamic Figure Drawing, Dynamic Hands, Dynamic Wrinkles, Artistic Anatomy, Anatomy for Artists, An Atlas of Anatomy For Artists, etc etc etc. Some of the other books I listed are almost the same price and are 10 times better. Its night and day between this book and the other Anatomy Drawing books."
1,feeling ill alot,I started taking this bio-flavonoid complex and a few of Country Life's other supplements and have not feel well while using the supplements. I am certain my bad health has something to do with these supplements and started about a months after taking the CL's products. I discontinued this product and all of the others and starting to feel better and hoping my full health returns. I am very upset Amazon is selling such poor products not verifying the ingredients and especially without us being allowed to see all of the labels on the entire bottle! It is just my opinion but I recommend not purchasing any supplements online unless you can see all of the labeling and verify the ingredients... Ingesting lead and other toxins will destroy your brain and all of the efforts you put into your nutrition and exercise program.
2,Nothing yet...,"I got this in hopes of helping my constant ear ringing because a friend had success with bioflavonoids recently. So far, no change for me. After a couple of weeks I finally noticed a little sticker on the side of the bottle warning about the product containing lead! What the heck?!?!"
3,For student teachers and brand new teachers,"It is not the fault of the author that this book was written up the way it was in my local paper. It was written as a book for teachers who are not familiar with the political process of the schools. I had taught for three years, but was not sure of all the politics that seem to take place in the higher levels that affected those of us who just wish to teach.This is a very good book for starting teachers who have not had much experience in the school system. It gives a basic outline of many factors you might experience; however, I would not recommend it to anyone who has had a year or more experience in the school system.Kudos to the author who wrote the book because of a bad experience she had and did not want other new teachers to go through."
4,"Good quality, comes apart quick and easy for cleaning","Everything about it is great! I do wish that one handle was bigger to accommodate more fingers, but then again Kerhsaw makes that as a different model. This is the same as the shears that come in Shun knife block sets."
4,Shears that last,"Finally, a set of shears that survives in my kitchen. No cracked, cheap plastic handles. No inseparable blades that prevent washing.Overall, a good set of shears. Perhaps a bit too much going on with them, but they do what I need them to do and they do it well.Follow up:It's now January 2012, and I still have the shears. The handles have held up to heavy use and the dishwasher with no damage. The blades are still sharp. They're good shears, with some slight ergonomic issues, but overall a good buy."
4,cuts well,"The fact that they come apart, it makes it very easy to clean. I haven't used all of the different options the shears provide, but I'm sure that I will eventually one day. The handles are a little small, but it's manageable. The shears are sharp."
1,Bad Design,"These scissors have a serious design flaw in my opinion.One of the edges has a ""bone notch"" which is designed for grabbing game or poultry bones. Unfortunately the things that I like to cut get stuck in this silly ""bone notch"" every time.Look at the photo above and you will see what I mean. There is no need for Kershaw to have a notch in the blade of my scissors.But next time I'm cleaning a Cornish Hen I will keep this gadget in mind."
3,Same brand as Kershaw,"The rating I'm providing on this product isn't completely fair. It may deserve a higher rating (or less). I've purchased this as a gift, so not sure how well it performs. But I felt I should weigh in and let people know what I didn't and that is it's the same as Kershaw. In fact I ordered this from the listed seller and received the Kershaw brand. It looks exactly the same, so I'm assuming it's the same company. But one thing I noticed is that other sellers are selling the Kershaw brand of these shears at a much lower price."
4,Good kitchen tool,"Got these for my husband, who didn't like the smaller, non-separating pair I use. These are particularly adept at dealing with most birds for prep and come apart for easy cleaning. The screw driver tips on the handles seem more in the way than useful (who needs a screwdriver tip on the back of scissors? Perhaps it is useful to pry open lids but the small tips don't look up to that task for long.) The bottle opener additions are more useful and fit with the design and utility of kitchen scissors. I would recommend these to a friend but like my Caphalon pair better for their weight and balance, even if they don't come apart for cleaning."
3,Not very comfortable,"They cut pretty well, but the grip is not comfortable at all. They'll do until I find some more comfortable."
1,Disappointing,Should have known by the price that the content and quality would be poor! There were only 6 designs to make - two of which are jewelry. I expected more. Would be best to save your money!
2,"Keep the money, don't fold it","The only redeeming model in this book is the dollar-bill ring. Your best bet is to pick it up used if it's under a dollar, or find it in a library and copy the diagrams for the ring.This is the kind of book that parents buy for the kids because of the neat-o cover. Mom and Dad--- avoid!"
1,No thanks,This product was not refrigerated upon arrival. It has a little sticker that states to refrigerate at once. OK. So you mean to tell me while it's in the mail for 5 days its not being cooled. That's nasty.
5,Snub Pollard Show time.,"How pleasing childhood memories the contemplation, now in full format, of those beloved Snub Pollard movies! In the years of my childhood (1950's) it was very popular in Europe, and concretely in Spain, an infantile projector model of the French company Pathé-Baby, developed in the years 1920's that my grandparents had given as a present to my mother, when she was a little girl, and later on, I used it with great amusement. The available movies then, they were fragments of the original ones whose rights Pathé had hired, with a duration of about 5 minutes each one. There was Chaplin, Harold Lloyd, Snub Pollard and others. Snub Pollard was known by its French denomination 'Beaucitron' (Beautiful lemon) (Why?) and I, together with friends of my age laughed a lot with him in the weekend days. It was our cinema! Very advisable this DVD for all those nostalgic of the silent movies."
2,Sadly Outdated,"I just came across this booklet on a back shelf and looked at it again after many years. I'd forgotten how antiquated the training techniques are! I was quite disappointed to see that the author hadn't updated his training methods since 1992.These techniques might work, but there are so many new, dog-friendly practices that work just fine that there is no reason to be so forceful with a puppy. If you are looking for helpful training methods, in addition to this booklet, please consider finding something that covers lure-and-reward training and clicker training. That way you can find what works best for you and your dog in a variety of situations."
2,not worth it,Don't waste your time with that unless you have nothing better to do. Just get some hints from someone else and you will be able to have similar results.
2,disappointed,"I too purchased this dvd thinking it was the real deal, only to find that dvd is not authorised by Evanescence nor by any party by whom they are represented., its not even Amy Lee voice in the songs that are played. I am a big fan and couldnt wait to watch dvd but was very disappointed as soon as I pressed play."
1,Product labled wrong,"Advertised prodict was ""Farmer's Friend Hand Salve"". But what arrived was ""Defender"". I have never seen ""Defender"" advertised anywhere. I fear this is old product."
3,Thunderbirds 2- Terror in New York City,"Not the best video for adult fans that are Gerry Anderson ""purists"". This the last of a series of 4 videos released coinciding with Fox Kids' US broadcast of The Thunderbirds (Note: This tape does not contain any of the annoying ""cut-ins"" that Fox had produced with the dopey teenage actors) . The editing job was ""fair/good"" (taking a 1 hour show and reducing it to 25 minutes). Basic story continuity was maintained. I can say that my 3 year old son loves it. He is now a bigger fan of the Thunderbirds than I ever was. You can watch this over and over again and not go insane. I note a new ""Supermarionation"" effect each time we watch it. It is a good video for parents who want to share a little nostaglia with their children."
2,Avoid it!,"This product appears to just be old technology. For perhaps $200 it might be worth the money, but for nearly double that it's ridiculous! It has an old grayscale LCD display that is very dim, it has no rechargeable lithium battery and no USB computer connection. It appears to be aimed at Chinese speakers to translate into English, not vice versa. All the function keys and on-screen icons are Chinese characters only. The English version instruction manual is incomplete and would benefit from some decent translation itself! Look elsewhere."
2,Sizing not as shown in charts,"Very cute dog jacket, well made, HOWEVER, despite having measured my dog (Bichon 21 lbs), and used sizing chart, the medium did not fit, not even close. Large was not in stock. Company fully refunded my shipping."
1,Where is it?,"It November 1st and the last day it would come in, according to the shipment online, was October 23rd. It November 1st and I don't have it. I'm not happy."
5,Colum Sands is Always Worth A Listen,"Colum Sands has a way with a story and a song that is at once charming and insightful. Sometimes tender, sometimes biting, always good-humored, Colum uses his sweet, clear voice, Irish heritage, and musical virtuosity to weave stories in his songs that make you wonder, smile, and sometimes, weep. ""Buskers"" is without a doubt a song that will make you do all three. ""The Night is Young"" will remind you that life is a journey best savored. ""Directions"" will make you laugh, and nod your head, and think, ""Yes, it really is like that!"" His two brothers, Ben and Tommy, and his sister Ann help him on this song, capable musicians all in their own rights. This recording, like his previous two, ""The March Ditch"" and ""Unapproved Road,"" is a treasure."
3,very pretty but...,I ordered this ring about a month and a half ago. It is very pretty and the stones sparkle nicely but one of the white crystals has already fallen out. Its not a big deal. I just wear that part of the ring toward my palm. But for the price this ring is a very nice product.
3,"pretty, but flawed","The crystals are lovely and sparkle a great deal. I purchased 2 and one of them has the alternating stones wrong. It's not bad and not worth returning, I just wear that part of the ring toward my palm. But for what you pay, it's a great ring!"
2,Arty porn,"Twelve short stories or other ""items""--all of a gay male pornographic nature--which apparently appeared previously in hard-core magazines. Some of the writing strives to be ""arty"" but that doesn't change things; this is just a collection of smut and not all that good."
2,Not what I expected,"I was hoping for a compilation of smart and clever romantic stories with erotic overtones. But this is just collection of written porn. There's a place for porn, of course, but I'd rather read real stories about real people -- in love or in lust -- than outrageous fantasies of improbably perfect people having improbably perfect sex.Not something I'm going to put on my coffee table."
5,The Legend of Blue Jacket - just a legend?,"This wonderful legend is truly a work of art, both by the author and the illustrator. I bought this for my grandchildren, but truly enjoyed reading it myself. The preface states it is just a legend, and that there was not much recorded in historical archives about Blue Jacket, but the way the author portrays this great warrior makes you feel like you are living during those times. One of the benefits of reading this story to my grandchildren was the fact that they began to ask questions about MORE people in history who lived during that time. Another trip to the book store!The art work is truly amazing and you can tell that the artist loved his job on this one. All in all, this was a wonderful story with moving pictures. Absolutely perfect for a quiet afternoon.Thank you, Mr. Spradlin - I wait anxiously for your second book."
1,The Legend of Blue Jacket,"I purchased this book out of curiosity to see what new fiction had been created about Blue Jacket. I am a direct decendent of one of Maraduke Van Swearingen's brothers. According to this legend, Duke Swearingen and Blue Jacket were the same person. This so called legend is worse than fiction. It is a complete lie because it is about real people. Chief Blue Jacket was not a white man kidnapped as a teenager, as this story goes. Our family records show he was born in a different decade than Blue Jacket and, as far as we know, never lived with the Indians or became a chief. The true history about the Shawnee chief has been messed with by 19th century pulp fiction writers and purpetuated by 20th and 21st century psudo historians. More information can be found at:[...]"
4,Great Deal,The book was in great shape and was shipped on time. It was a gift and they really enjoyed the book.
2,Problems with the MP3 Downloads,"This review is NOT for the CD release, but the MP3 downloads. Firstly, the music and its interpretation are fine: I would rate these as at least 4 stars. However, the downloads have severe problems when the tracks change, a problem that I thought had disappeared: The tracks in Jeu De Cartes are meant to be played without break: The engineers have made a mess of the track transitions. Some are fine without any corrections. Some require about 0.4 second crossfades to smooth out the errors. But some require as much as 2 seconds, which, because of the length of the crossfade, results in sounds as if something is missing: the notes don't quite fit, and neither does the tempo.I would recommend that until this problem is resolved, you refrain from the download and go with the CD.Incidentally, the problem is quite apparent with iTunes, Windows Media Player, Nero player, and the Roxio player."
3,Experimental classical music,"Zorn has written a half-hour tribute to the artistic spirit, employing a small orchestra to play blocks of music. It takes a while to get used to but, because you get something new every time you listen, it's rewarding. If you like Zorn (or anything on his label, Tzadik), you'll like this. Casual listeners might not be too happy with it."
1,Zorn: not a classical composer,"Not a bad record. Far from. Simply not the best Zorn record to be found. Great admiration for the man with the thousand ideas but not a fan of his ""written"" music. Prefer Zorn with other projects: Masada, Naked City and his Film Work collection, in which his talent of chosing performers for his music, imposing his ideas on them and still giving them the freedom to make music that is unmistably John Zorn, are resulting in breathtaking releases."
5,Catch Me If You Can,"Excellent fast paced reading. From someone who is in law enforcement, this book was right on. Good character development and crime description. A great read about true crime in our modern day society."
4,Incredible true crime story,"I found Catch Me If You Can to be an incredible true crime story. The account of the crime was fascinating and the cat and mouse games between law enforcement and the perpetrator kept this a fast paced read. The writer's style was at times cliched and somewhat ""Dragnet"" like, but I found that kept things light as the true story was really very dark and ominous. This was a great book about one detective's tenacity in bringing to a close a truly gruesome crime."
4,Attention to detail on search warrants; dull to some....,"As the other reviewers have described, this is a true crime yarn that is well-written and fascinating for its attention to detail.One aspect of this book which sets it somewhat apart from other true crime books is the attention to detail given to the preparation of the search warrants and a discussion of the more technical aspect of this process. Some will find that dull and tedious, I appreciate the effort the author put into this and the fact that it was not left on the cutting room floor.The other reviewers have done a good job of describing the essence of this book."
5,Great Writing,Really enjoyed this book. The author is definately above par. Recommended to everyone.
1,no,"imho the intense focus on physical sensations, excluding observation of feeling states, thought, externals, makes this method unbalanced. creates freak-outs in many who attend the 10day 'course.' the stated goal of equanimity seems not actual goal. didn't need my body to 'disappear.' technique seems mired in cultivating bliss-states (as opposed to clarity) while claiming contrary. confusing and confused. looked great on the surface. beneath surface theory and methodology revealed is rigid, doctrinaire--counter to it's own claims and counter to true dharma. cultish. keep looking. I also want to add, (November 18, 2010) that a lot of the glowing reviews here are written by the 'true believers' and repeat retreat attendees and supporters. That's fine. Just read between the lines and decide for your self."
1,unfortunate...,"IMHO, bad technique. (from a person who attended the 10 day as well, has over 12 years of martial arts, taoist and buddhist meditation technique)find a good teacher, not a book, nor a 10-day given by a video tape with inept teachers...SN Goenka has a biased, single-minded view. Never knew dhamma was biased. Didn't Buddha say 10,000 paths to enlightement, and not one?"
5,A Great Book,"This book is amazing. It has read my mind. Throughtout the book, it was telling me my mind state, how it works, how meditation works to solve puzzles put in front of you in your day to day life."
5,A great introduction to the subject,"Am on to my second reading of this book and ""almost"" ready to sign up for the ten day course.This really is abook on Vipassana Mediataion and not a collection of anecdotes on Buddhism or life. On the one hand this can make it a little dry on the other it doesn't pretend to be something it isn't.If anyone reading this review has done the ten day course I would love to hear your comments.Enjoy the book, enjoy life.chalky_white@yahoo.com"
5,Well designed and easy to use,Delievered as promossed. Easy to put together. Sturdy for intended use. Good price point.
3,A good excuse for teh director to spend time with people she admires,Some interesting comments by a variety of interesting directors but the whole thing seems kind of random and arbitrary. I suppose if I had the money to do so (as Angela Ismailos apparently does) making a film like this would be a good excuse to spend some time with people I admire.
4,pretty darn good,"Getz rarely lets you down. The only reason I did not give it five stars is because I was not all that wild about his version of Automn Leaves...otherwise, as stated above, I like what Getz does. Lots of music for the money. It's worth it."
2,Not so great,"I'm not an especially sweaty or stinky guy and I work in an office 8-5. This product worked until about noon and then I started to get a decidedly musky aroma. By 5:00, it was full-on body odor.I really wanted to like this product. But it just didn't work for me."
1,smells like teen spirit,"When I took a whiff of this from the top of the stick before I turned the knob, it smelled most like a women's moisturizer. Unfortunately, as soon as it is applied, it smelled most like, uh, a Bradford Pear tree in blossom, and doesn't fully go away. Maybe the odor is due to mixing witch hazel with one of the other ingredients, I don't know.I'd like to find a healthy deodorant, without aluminum and such in it, and that doesn't have a strong odor. I was hoping I had found it with this product, even though it is more expensive than average. But a product that confers an odor like semen probably sends the wrong message in most social contexts."
4,Easy build,But the fins do occasionally pop off. We found that glueing them in place was the ticket to keep them on.
3,Time/age discrepancy,"I am not done with this book and so far, I'm enjoying it. . . but, it drives me crazy when authors/editors don't catch things like major discrepancies with the characters. Once of the issues with Kate and her sister, Sarah, is that Kate gave birth on Sarah's wedding day. Since Kate is fresh out of high school (around age 18) when Ryan is born, that would make Sarah getting married at 17. But later in the book, there is a statement that because of the six-year age difference, the sisters were never close growing up. If that is true, then Sarah got married at 12????? In the long run, it probably does not make much impact to the story, but someone should have caught this!"
3,Not for me,"Not really my style of book but certainly easy to read. Not bad writing, just kind of a ""fluff"" book."
5,Excellent Book,"This was a free kindle download. This was a first read of this author and I enjoyed the book very much. It held my interest from the beginning which for me can be a deal breaker. If I can't get a feel for a book within the first three chapters, I'm apt to not finish reading it. I would recommend this book and author."
4,Family and relationships...,"I'd say this book is all about dealing with difficult family, an aging family member, and relationships. I generally wouldn't like this kind of book but I found I could relate in many ways and stuck through. There are a few annoying editing and grammatical errors as well that can be bothersome."
1,Don't waste your money!!!!!,I bought this cookie press 2 years ago & only use it at Christmas.The first year it worked great but while I was using it this yearthe collar just under the handle started to crack. I was able to finish mycookies but now the press is useless. I called Wilton's 1-800-794-5866They will send me a new cookie press (same old style) or if I send them the differenceI can get an up graded model. I've read the reviews on the other models & they don't seem to be much better.I think I'll try a different Company.
4,Great Cookie Press,I love this cookie press. It is such a fun way to make sugar cookies. They turn out so beautiful. It is super easy. And the press is very inexpensive.
4,Wilton comfort grip cookie press,I have only used it one time but found the cookie dough to be too soft for good results. It was recommended to me and I will use it again but not for Spritz cookies.
4,"Works well, easy clean up","Unlike the other reviewer, I've had no problems for many years. I use the cookie recipe provided on the box, roll a bit of dough into a log, fill the tube, and do one click per cookie. One tube-full is about 2.5 dozen cookies, ish (about one cookie-sheet full--yes, the cookies are of dainty size). Ten minutes in the oven and you're done! The first cookie per tube-full is weird-shaped (okay, for the cook!) but the others do well. Clean up is pretty straightforward: twist off the cap, pop out the cookie-shape insert, twist off the tube and wash."
2,Worked great -- for two batches,"This cookie press was easy to use and made nicely shaped cookies, but the plastic ring collar broke in the middle of the second batch of cookies. We used the recipe on the cookie press box and our dough was well-softened and not very stiff, so I don't think we in any way abused the cookie press. It's simply a poor design. That's too bad; I'd be happy to pay a little more for a higher-quality product."
1,Sorry; not to my liking...,"Unfortunately, this did not live up to the 'ease of use' it was supposed to be. I had a very hard time with the 'trigger' not pushing the dough thru, had to repeatedly plunge it to get the dough out. After awhile my hand actually hurt! Went back to my old Mirro twister type. Sorry"
2,Didn't last,"Well, I tried this other Wilton cookie press becuase the stainless steel one wore down. The comfort grip handle was great! The only problem is that the plastic collar split in the middle after the 4th batch. The dough started oozing out and I ended up having to get rid of it. I'm still searching for a press that won't break - I go through one every year."
4,Worked great for me!,"I was worried about the many negative reviews for this product, but it was what I could afford this year and boy am I glad I bought it. I don't understand the complaints, because this cookie press worked awesome for me. I whipped out dozens of cookies in minutes and the only part I semi-struggled with (and this was likely my inexperience showing) was filling the tube with dough. I used the recipe on the package (with a bit more flavoring added) and it worked like a dream.I can't speak to how long it will last since I just now used it for the first time, but I have zero complaints thus far."
2,"Good at first, but after awhile.....","If you use a cookie press only once a year this might be the cookie press for you. However, if you bake more often, or bake dozens of batches of these cookies, go with a model made of metal. I have owned 3 of these, thinking that it was just my brute strength that kept busting the plastic squeeze handle, but my 65 year old mother also had the same part break. The plastic is cheap, my daughter does not have the strength to squeeze the cookies out so she can't help with the baking. If you look at the picture, the blue underside of the grip right under the curve is where this unit will eventually break. If you don't dropping 12-15 bucks at a time to keep replacing this press, then buy it, otherwise, upgrade to a more durable metal model that will last for years instead of months. Last year I bought a Kuhn and am very happy with it. My third and final Wilton broke this year so I will hopefully not be replacing the Kuhn for awhile."
2,Makes good cookies but cheap plastic,"This cookie press makes the cookie shapes like it does on the box but only after one month, the ring around the tube cracked right in half. The plastic is thinner than it should be and seems to be cheap. I would pay a little more for a better quality cookie press."
1,Terrible Design,"This is the second Wilton cookie press we've owned, and both have been sub-par. This one in particular suffered the same problem as so many others have had - after a handful of uses the plastic collar piece split. Wilton should stick with metal cake pans and leave the cookie presses to someone else. This is certainly the last one I'll buy."
1,"Looked good, worked not so good",I make all types of cookies but hadn't tried spritz cookies in years. This cookie press made about a dozen cookies and then the trigger just wouldn't work any longer. The trigger has to catch on a notch on the plunger to press the next cookie out. After a few cookies the trigger skipped a bit catching the plunger and then after about a dozen it quit working altogether. It was a total waste of money. Ended up making thumbprint cookies!
1,Didn't last long,This product worked beautifully while it lasted. I've had it for three years and usually only use it twice a year. We used it this year (2010) for Christmas cookies and the plastic ring that holds the disks broke so that the dough would ooze out the side with each press. Too bad as I really enjoyed using this product while it lasted.
1,not very happy---,"I was so looking forward to get my cookiemaker ----First you can,t use dough with chopped nuts --no dried fruits,, I would like to get my monet back ?????"
1,good...if you want to buy a new press for every batch!,"this worked well for the first 2 or 3 times i used it. i usually only make spritz cookies at christmas, so only use it a few times a year. the first time i couldn't get it to work i thought it was my fault (though it was the same cookie recipe i've always used, i changed pans, refrigerated the dough longer, let it soften longer, cleaned the device again...). i tried it again recently and ended up throwing the whole gun in the trash. it's a straightforward concept- easy to understand the mechanics, easy to load and assemble, but after the first few uses it just doesn't seem to push dough out, almost like the plunger grooves aren't able to catch. it wasn't super sturdy to begin with, and i should have realized ""you get what you pay for"" but i guess i thought a large baking company would offer a better quality item."
1,Stopped working.,"It worked for the first batch, but it stopped expelling dough on the second batch. I got it at Michael's and will return it."
4,Loved it while it lasted...,Well I have had the cookie press about three years. I really loved it and I loved the recipes on the box for the cookies and so did everyone I made them for. At times even using the wilton recipe I did have a problem getting the cookies to come off the press onto the pan but for the most part it was fun and worked pretty well especially for the price. I normally only use it about 2 or 3 times a year and this year when I was making Christmas cookies it broke. One of the plastic pieces started cracking while I was putting the cookies on the cookie sheet and then it eventually cracked to where it was unusable. I thought maybe I pushed too hard or did something but now after reading other reviews I see this is a common problem with this product. I still think it was well worth the $10 it cost when I bought it a few years ago for the amount of cookies I got to make with it.
2,Wilton cookie press use review,It is a little hard to use have to have the handle in just the right place before it will work an if dough is not just the right consistency it just goes right through the press or will not come out at all. I use my old one now most of the time.
5,Big fun baking holiday cookies with my boys,My boys are 4 & 6 and they love making cookies with this. Just one click and the cookie is on the cookie sheet. The christmas trees and stars are their favorites. We use a sugar cookie mix dough to make the cookies. We made the cookie recipe included with the set and it was good but it is just easier for me to use a commercial mix.
5,Easy and FUN!,"My kids and I really enjoyed using this to bake Christmas cookies. It was easy to use and pretty easy to clean, too. Lots of designs - we'll be using it again for Valentine's day!They also use it with their Play-Doh. Cheaper than a lot of the Play-Doh brand toys."
1,There's a reason it's cheap,"Just tossed my second Wilton cookie press in the trash after it broke. The plastic just cracked so the barrel would not stay attached to the press; my previous press cracked at the other end of the barrel where the discs are inserted. I'm done with Wilton, and am going to buy a metal press."
1,Very Poorly Made!,"This brand is very cheaply made, sadly. After using Wilton cake pans for years with no problem, I expected better quality from their cookie presses. I ordered one recently, and the very first time we used it, the trigger would not work to squeeze out the dough. I have made many batches of Spritz cookies successfully in the past, so I know the problem was not me; it was the poorly designed cookie press. BUYER BEWARE on this product!"
1,The Worst Cookie Press That I Have Ever Used,"This press lasted for no more than two batches of cookies - despite numerous attempts, the dough would not come out and ultimately, I had to revert to an old press that I had purchased back in 1994 - I would not suggest this product."
3,You sir are no Andrei Tarkovsky,"Sokurov really got it right with Russian Ark, but everything else that is available in the US, not so thrilling (though, Moloch is kind of interesting). The best parts of this documentry would be the footage lifted from Tarkovsky's Voyage in Time. Russian Ark is hardly enough to anoint him as ""Tarkovsy's spiritual heir,"" whatever that means. Get everything available by Tarkovsky first, and if you have any money left try this."
5,Haunting!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I vividly remember the very first time I saw this about 15 years ago. I was NOT well!This is a chilling expose' on the potential pitfalls of excessive denial. It follows the exploits of a down-trodden actress who is obviously behind on just about everything but most importantly, her telephone bill. There are only about 4 people in the whole film, Whoopi, Elliott Gould, his blond companion, and the telephone man.This would be an eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeexcellent Twilight Zone episode because the first time I watched it, I was completely taken aback by the ending.This is a wooooooooooooooooonderful showcase for that sorely underappreciated talent that is Whoopi. It is intense, surprising, poignant, heartbreaking, and laugh-out-loud funny.A tour-de-force!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Interesting dark comedy,"Although, no one may have like this film, I still enjoyed Whoopi's performance. It's a very dark comedy. I've heard that Whoopi didn't like the script for this film and tried to back out, but couldn't because she was under contract. That may be why Whoopi's performance wasn't as well received by the critics."
1,worst movie I've ever seen,"I agree with the other two reviews. Don't waste your time watching this. I couldn't handle it till the end, so I was never amused. I rented it only because Whoopi was in it. Don't make the same mistake."
1,This is the worst movie I've ever seen.,I like art films and underground hits. Some of the reviews on this site may lead you to believe that The Telephone belongs in that catergory. It doesn't. It was terrible and boring as all hell. I returned it halfway through the movie and the clerk was not surprised to see me back. Don't fall into the trap - DON'T RENT THIS MOVIE.
1,I want my 90 minutes back!!!!!,"I actually saw this in the theater!!!!! It was the dollar cinema. When it began there were 20 or so in the theater. They all got up and walked out during the movie. My friend and I wanted to go get our dollar back. Then it became a challenge to see if we could sit through perhaps the WORST FILM EVER MADE!! We were actually the ONLY two left when it ended so they didn't find out the !!!WOW!!! surprise ending (sarcasm). I really really really loved her original Broadway show and could see where she tried to pull that material to film. If you love Whoopi watch that old HBO special for her at her very best. She doesn't even claim this movie was made on Netflix and with GOOD reason. Rent it for the sport of masochism,...IF YOU DARE!!!"
1,I wish she never made this....,"Whoopie Goldberg is my favorite actress. Having said that, this is the worst film I've ever seen. I rented it expecting something totally different. I only watched the first 15 minutes and then turned it off. I've since found out what the ending is, but I'm not sure it justifies having to watch more than five minutes of film to get there. As a ten minute Twilight Zone episode, it might be great, but otherwise, please watch something else of her's."
4,Wait Till The End,The Telephone was a slow movie. When I saw it I was about to turn it off. Then I decided to finish it. WOW! The ending was so great! I did not see it coming! Then you understand the entire movie and when you think of all the phone conversations she had you can't help but laugh. This is a Great movie.
1,What are you people on?,"RUN! Run while you still can!!! I actually watched this movie in the theater. It was the dollar cinema. there were maybe 30 people in the theater at the start. Slowly, slowly, they all left. At the end my friend and I were the ONLY people in the theater! For a while we wanted to go get our dollars back, then we felt it was like a badge of honor to actually sit through this to the end!!!!! Wow, what an unforeseen shocker( yeah right )at the end. I can claim to have watched the WORST MOVIE EVER MADE. If you like Whoopi, whom I LOVE, just watch her HBO one woman show from 1985 or so. That was where she pulled the ideas from for this ""movie"". She's probably never been as funny since. Jumping Jack Flash is also one of her best. I think the rest of the reviewers must have been paid off by the dvd release company."
4,They've improved!,"After hearing Naftile's Dream's first album, I was enthusiastic to hear more of their work. It's interesting that their songs tend to be hit-or-miss, with no grey area for me. ""Search for the Golden Dreydl"" was about 50/50, while this new album only has a couple tracks that don't do much for me. they threw a bit more improvisation into ther work, which they do very well. There is a definite chemistry betwen the various instruments involved. ""Smash, Clap!"" is a great aural stimulus."
5,Timeless classic,"Shoe wardrobe staple. King of the 70s and 80s playground, Dunlop reinvent their classic plimsoll for the classic tennis whites, pimms and wooden frame rackets slung over shoulder look. Far more stylish than those grubby little Converse trainers."
1,Was She Pretty by Leanne Shapton,"I ordered this book after seeing a clever slide show of drawings by Leanne Shapton in the New York Times. ""Was She Pretty"" did not satisfy my desire for more. It was repetitive, to say the least, and, quite frankly, a little boring. The drawings were not as good as the group that inspired my purchase. I do not recommend......wish I did."
2,She is never pretty,I thought that book was cute but lacking in content; the abundance of illustrations and one paragraph entries was a little off-putting and I was expecting something a bit more substantial. But still a cute book for a light read.
5,Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,"Anyone who's old enough to have racked up a few ex-lovers, each of whom come fortified with a backlist of their own, will thrill to the economical poetry of this book. It made me feel nostalgic, and a part of something larger than myself.Did she change the names?"
5,Why is so popular on the wild21?,"The Black and White Brothers have released an absolute gem with ""Put your hands up"". This track,and the remixes, is undoubtably one of the high points of 1999 for all dance music lovers. This mix of fast paced electronic beats provides a welcome change for those sick of been bombarded with the excess keyboard in the vengaboys beach party style. I loved, my friends loved and you'll love it. Go out and buy it now."
1,Poor customer service,"The pepper grinder stopped working after a few months use. When I finally got around to contacting the company, I was informed without a sales receipt they will not service it. I have the mill and original packaging but the limited warranty is only valid with a receipt."
4,"Great grinder, not very well labeled","This grinds salt and pepper very well and it is easy to adjust between coarse and fine grain. Pepper and Salt sides are barely marked with a small P and S, I would have preferred a larger marking or some color designation."
2,only lasted three months,Work fine until tried to wanted to reload pepper mill. Very hard to replace salt and pepper. Pepper mill fell apart after only three months.
2,Not a Fan,"After only a few months of use, I am replacing this salt and pepper grinder, not because it broke or didn't work decently. My big issue with it is how hard it is to replace the salt and pepper. Really it should not be so hard. My husband also doesn't like how it is not so obvious which side is salt and which side is pepper, nor is it so obvious to someone who doesn't spend much time in the kitchen how to adjust the coarseness etting. Liked the look but really thought there were design flaws here."
2,regret,I had this grinder for over a year now. The grinder for one side broke after 7 months. This product looks great but it doesn't last long
3,Avreage book by an Avreage Author,"Proteus is another book by Morris West who this time writes about one of the richest men in the world who, oh surprise, has a concience. John Spada doubles as head of the Proteus organization, whose mission is helping prisioners of concience around the world. When his daughter is captured by a terrorist organization, there is now knowing what he will do.It is entretaining and the action and thematic is pretty good, though the action gets kind of repetive, and the motivations and dialogues are kind of sappy."
3,"very brights, crap LED","LEDs suck. can barley see them. but i wasnt expecting them to work anyhow. very very bright though. so thats perfect. does come with 2, i know the description wasnt clear on that"
2,Worked for a couple of hours,"I purchased this product with anticipation and got it fully installed the 7 color L.E.D rings did not work well, only 4 worked properly and when receiving the wires some were pulled out on the lights. After using for about an hour all the L.E.D rings stopped working, I really like the HID fog lights they work great and look great, but I'm trying to contact Pilot Automotive and discuss this problem. I believe it is a defective set of lights, I don't want to turn anyone away with my bad experience I am going to try and get a new set and hope they will work."
1,hard as a rock or frozen gel,This is a terrible mouse pad. One of the firmest and there are so little gel in it compare to the hard surface. I stopped using it after 1 week.
4,exactly what I wanted for my class,This fits the needs of my class to be able to read and understand. It also gives a basis for discussion in Spanish.
3,Dictionary Needed,I was disappointed to find this edition does not have an included dictionary. The story is otherwise interesting and fun to read.
5,I like this series.,"I like this series and have read through them twice. My ability to read and understand Spanish has increased since I started reading them. This book is my favorite in the series. The stories are interesting, and the teens in the stories often learn lessons (e.g. people can be very happy without all the luxuries we have here in the U.S.). I made my 15yo son read some of them last summer. He wasn't too crazy about them, but I think that was mostly because he didn't want to do anything with Spanish while he was on summer break. And, well, the books are not quite Lord of the Rings or Agatha Christie mysteries. LOL!Each book has a Spanish-to-English dictionary in the back which contains almost every word used. I think these books are reasonably priced, especially when using Amazon's 4-for-3 promotion."
4,Easy cleanup and works fast!,"I was very impressed with how easy it was to cleanup. Almost just rinse and go. It works really fast too. The only problems I have is it seems to work so fast that it doesn't get all the juice. Plus it makes a lot of pulp, which if you are using soft fruits (pears, peaches..) it can clog with pulp. Not too hard to push out the pulp and then it's ready again, but I do feel like I am wasting some fruit. Overall though, it's a great juicer. I have used several other juicers and this one is by far the best. My old roommate had a Juiceman and I would only use it rarely because it was not easy to clean."
1,Defective and I got NO REFUND! DO NOT BUY IT!,"Very poor guality. It leaked all over the place and it is such a pain to clean! I had an old model of Juicy Mania and I regret I gave it away. It was easier to clean.This item worked (at least ""worked"")for a couple of weeks and then blown out. Now it's complitely off. I had burning smell and smog over all my kithen area.I contacted Breville Customer Service for replacement and they REFUSED to replace it because it Factory-Reconditioned!!!! I thought that reconditioned means improved, nobody explained that it means - been broken before and then fixed! So, all these money are spent and all I have left is a burned juice maker..."
4,Works great!!,"This juicer is exactly what I had hoped for and exactly what I was expecting. I was a little worried about this being a refurbished unit, but the machine itself arrived completely clean and looked professionally packaged. (The instruction booklet, however, looked a little worked over. Some of the pages stuck together and some were torn a bit, and the cover was discolored.. but these are really non-issues. I'm sure I can find the instructions online if I need to!)Clean-up is a breeze and I love that all the pieces are dishwasher safe! It does a good job with what I've put in it so far: ginger root, carrots, whole apples, strawberries, kiwi, oranges (peeled). I'm really looking forward to using this juicer more."
5,Love it,"I was a bit worried when I read a few comments about the ""Reconditioned"" units. Mine arrive in perfect condition and all the parts looked like new. I have been using it for a few days now and it works perfectly. Very happy with this purchase so far!!!"
2,Pretty useless for serious juicing,"I was really excited to get this -- my first juicer. I'd been making green juices and vegetable juices in my blender, which was no fun at all. And I was sorely disappointed the first time I fed it a head of kale and got three drops of liquid. The yields from all but the juiciest of vegetables are pretty pitiful.If all you want to do is juice apples and carrots, this is a good option.If you are trying to explore the world of juiced greens, herbs, ginger, broccoli, cucumber, and the countless other amazing things you can do with juicing, save your money and get a good masticating juicer. I bought an omega, which works very well, and many of my friends swear by a green star."
4,"Very good, reconditioned","The juicer arrived in a cardboard colored box(reconditioned). I am used to reconditioned=new from shopping at Apple, UBID etc. This was indeed reconditioned(may be used slightly). Packaging inside did not seem like new. But saved a few bucks and it works great. The mesh filter does not clean 100% so I am going to call Breville customer service about that and then maybe I will update my review."
5,Highly Recommended,"I use this juicer every day and have not had one single problem with it. It's powerful, easy to assemble, and easy to clean. I generally hand wash, but occasionally top shelf dishwasher clean all but the filter (this I always wash by hand). Since I usually make ""green"" drinks using greens, celery, apples, and lemons, I have reason to use both speeds (low for the greens) and both do just I need them to do. So far I haven't been able to put an entire apple down the chute (your apples would have to be relatively small ones to do this), but how hard is it to cut them into quarters? The lemons fit down whole, no problem."
5,Very happy,"I found this Juicer to be excellent and well worth the price. The large intake tube accepts everything I have wanted to juice without any cutting, while the powerful motor breezes through whatever it comes in contact with. I will also note that cleaning has not been an issue, I just run everything under the faucet, the dishwasher has not been necessary. Good buy."
5,Excellent Juicer,"Reconditioned? Seems brand new to me. It's fast and efficient, easy to take apart, clean and put back together. It doesn't get the pulp as dry as my GreenStar, but the GS is so hard to use and clean that I don't use it. I've used the Breville every day since I got it."
4,half and half,"you dont get much juice from it,very powerful,very good for the pricethe bottom tray where all the juice gets extract to could use a new design and maybe that will get more juice out of it. instead of it just lieing flat. why not design it so it would have an tilt to it so small amount of juice would not just sit there or cling onto the tray and it doesnt cost any less or more to design it that way.4/5 stars"
2,upsetting,"After VERY careful research, I decided to go with this juicer. The night I got it, I put oranges in it and it worked EXCELLENT! The next day I spent (wasted) a LOT of money on fruit and juiced it ALL...Out of bunch of grapes, 4 oranges 1 lb blueberries, 3 kiwi, 3 apples, 4 bananas, 1 quart strawberries, etc...I got about 16oz of juice and probably 4-5lbs of WASTE! It was all in the pulp container! I was SO disappointed. Now Im juicer-less, but Amazon was WONDERFUL with the return process. Thats all I can say;("
5,Great Juicer,This juicer is absolutely perfect! I would not have known it was reconditioned if I hadn't ordered it myself. Very easy to assemble and has plenty of power to juice whatever I throw at it. Sturdy parts and very easy to clean and it produces a nice amount of juice. I would recommend it to anyone.
1,Flaw in product,"I love this juicer BUT the juice collector - the part of the product where the vegetables/fruit initially go - cracked twice. The first time, the company willingly replaced it. But now it has cracked again. This happened when I juiced, as advised on high speed, a beet. Seems the force of the speed and the hardness of the vegetable are too much for the juice collector. Not a good thing for a juicer."
2,"ANTHRAX LADDEN, WHITE MOLD GRAB BAG","I thought this was a deal to good to pass up and I was right. I should have passed it up. When the juicer arrived it looked clean and perfect. Upon inspection it was sticky and not clean at all. It has crud stuck on the outside of the switch area and was sticky to the touch. the grinding basket had white mold on it. It definitely had not been cleaned or ""reconditioned"". I was so disappointed. It did come with a book and other parts but the bottom line is that it isn't reconditioned at all. Its someone Else's boxed up garage sale grab bag special. If you leave food intact in a warm climate it will grow mold, some deadly. It had white mold all over the main food processing area. I would be careful before using these used machines. Clean everything for sure. I sent mine back for refund."
2,it works but not the best,savings for recondition was not worth it.the factory recondition breville was toreplace the one I had for years. I shouldof purchased new. large pieces are leftbehind. With some uses the motor smellsburnt.
3,Great juicer,I really like my juicer but if I could do it again I would get more out of a multifunction juicer.
1,What a hassle!,I had understood this juicer to be one of the best available. Nobody mentioned that you had to repeatedly scrape out and clean out the basket or it didn't work. I thought you just put the fruit/vegetable in and out came a lot of juice and some very dry pulp. My pulp was extremely soggy and the juice was loaded with pulp too. I used a whole peck of apples to make 4 cups of extremely thick pulpy juice - what a waste of my time and money.
3,"Powerful, but too much pulp","I'm very impressed by how powerful and fast this juicer is (compared to my old juiceman jr.--it's no contest). However, I really wanted a juicer that extracted as much juice from the produce as possible, and because it works so fast, it seems like for vegetables without a lot of juice (greens), most of them end up as pulp. That's my only complaint."
2,Breville is amazingly sloppy!,"We ordered the rebuilt unit and it arrived promptly. On unpacking, we were surprised to find the top plastic dome cover to have been broken in shipping. But on further inspection, found the instruction manual to be covered with dark black notes from the prior owner. And then, we discovered the original owner's product registration materials included in the box! Breville must have many returns, judging from the volume of rebuilt units they sell. And the lack of attention to their packaging and the carelessness of sending out old marked up manuals suggests they are really a very sloppy company. BTW... the unit itself seems to work nicely. If only it had arrived intact. Buyer beware!"
5,Wow What A Juicer!,"Decided to replace my old juicer (juiceman), and started comparing models. I found that the Breville fountain 2 speed juicer had all of the features I was looking for, and I was not disappointed. The machine was quick to set up and juicing was a snap. Cleanup was a little time consuming, but expected. This juicer had less parts to clean than the other models I was considering. I am very pleased with this juicer and would recommend it to anyone."
3,Back in the Hopper.,"Yes, this is a movie or rather ""study"" about a family of sisters coping with cultural change at the advent of Pre WWII. As a previous reviewer stated, the movie requires a great deal of patience. It is deliberately slow perhaps to capture the essence of an everyday, seemingly peaceful existance of a middle class family gone awry.What I found difficult was not the theme of the movie, but rather how the scenes were filmed mostly indoors limiting the lighting, and most of the outdoor scenes seem to be filmed during overcast days. Perhaps this was intentional but it made it difficult to watch the movie."
5,Japan Revisited,"A beautiful movie that provides some insight to Japanese culture, i.e., family relations, and beautiful photography. The kimonos the ladies wore were magnificent."
2,A travesty,"This film version of a tender, graceful book mistakes bathos for pathos and calendar art for cinema. It was made as an ornament to Toho Film Co.'s 50th anniversary and, like some events with a big build-up, is a chilling anticlimax. The star-studded cast are not capable of resembling a family of any sort, and certainly not the Makioka family, as Tanizaki wrote them. His book needed a classy scenario - what it gets here is pedestrian dialogue delivered in formulaic performances. Director Kon Ichikawa's camera does not know where it wants to be in many of the interior scenes. It tries every angle on for size. Nothing can come to life, cinematically, under this aimlessness. The art direction - the story is set in 1930s Japan - is perfectly evocative of 1983, when the film was made. It is also evocative of what many recognise to be a sterile period in Japanese cinema."
5,A very good product,"Keyboard has lots of features. More than you'll probably use. The mouse is very accurate and convenient to use with its many buttons.However, please remember to put the mouse im its charging cradle every few days.A quality keyboard"
3,"Not Bad, Bluetooth Version Better",I bought the 3100 and found the RF wireless connectivity more complicated than Bluetooh. I returned the 3100 for the 5000 Bluetooth version.
2,Didn't help,This formula did not help my itchy ear. After applying two drops my ear felt clogged and once the clog went away the itch returned. I was not impressed but I dont doubt the other good claims made it the reviews. Its off to the doctor for me.
1,Threw them in the garbage,"These are thick glopy ear drops that just sat in my ear and clogged it up. I had to wash them out, these are useless.I tossed the bottle in the garbage."
2,Gave me an earache for scuba-diving,"I got this stuff after other scuba divers recommended getting some ear drops that helped water in your ear evaporate after a dive to prevent stuffiness and infections. This stuff *caused* stuffiness and gave me some dangerous reverse blockages as I was coming up from depth. Don't use it if you're scuba-diving - use the alcohol-based stuff, not anything with oils in it. It may be fine for other applications, but I don't need it for any other applications."
2,not my style of music...,"I'm not sure where this music fits properly with other styles of music. But I certainly thought this young lady is missing her style. Miss Stone looked to be performing for someone in the audience. The style of this music left me wondering how she might do as a serious performer; she has some basics, but the performance left me reaching for my remote control!!!"
4,The right stuff for me,"This is a wonderful product for Brazilians. If you live in Brazil and are going to US or can buy it and deliver for a friend who is travelling abroad, I truly recommend it.The international standard for power outlets, that despite being ""international"" is only beeing used in Brazil, make impossible to find this kind of outlets in Brazil anymore. But the most of our electronic devices that are imported have the american standard! So this power strip is ideal for someone who has this similar problem.One incovenient: it is 127 volts only. So check the voltage of your house before buying!"
4,Multiplug Power Strip,"This is a good product shipped in time. As the name suggests, it's a 6 outlet power strip and does a decent job. I ordered it for my dorm to use with my different electronic gadgets. It's a good product. Go with it."
4,Why didn't I think of this before?,Every winter I have to hook up a humidifier in my bedroom and had electric cords running everywhere due to all the electrical stuff I have on my nightstand. Then it dawned on me - power strips are not only for computer rooms and entertainment centers. This sits in back of the night stand and takes care of all the junk I just have to have plugged in.
3,Good,"The book is good, but I think it is a little limited because it is a succession of cases, which do not correlate. Yoyr skills may be improved but not your knowledge. It is like learning a formula with the numbers already filled in , but not the formula with its symbols."
1,[bad] :(,... the scripts don't work. The downloaded scripts are different to the ones outlined in the book (neither work) and the after sale support is non-existant.The first book of the series was great... This rarely works and this book is no exception...
3,Could have been perfect.,"This phone had everything I really needed: phone, dual alarm, and even had alarm options (I use the church bells -- nicer than a blaring alarm that startles you out of bed). What I don't like (and for me it's a big CON), is that the numbers are much too difficult to read from any distance whatsoever because they are so light. It basically looks blank or like 88:88 unless you are close up. This is no good to me when I am trying to see the time from across the room while getting ready for work or from bed to see how many more minutes I can stall before I have to really get up to get ready. Even though I just bought this 2 months ago, I am back to find another model -- I'll miss the church bells in the morning...."
3,Timex telephone,"It works fine, I like the fact that I don't have to use a loud buzzer to wake me up and that you can set the alarm for 7/5 or 2 days. The display is hard to see, but all the good features outweigh the 1 bad."
3,very decent,"Nice and big, good weight. I guess my only beef with it is the high gloss black inlay in the design, it kind of cheapens it. Still, a good buckle overall."
3,eh,its an ok blade but when i got it it was a curve in the spine and it wont come out but once you get past that its an ok blade and ite sharpens well even thoguh it was completly blunt when i got it
5,"Life, sex, and death: the drama of Keats' last days","Love may not kill, but it can certainly give you a smart shove down that road. Walsh's vivid, neatly researched book gives us a new look at the one whose name was writ on water and his curious agonies over the girl he would have married. Keats, impassioned, gifted, doomed, is even so not gilded here; from the surviving materials he is revealed as intense, a bit obsessive, and never more so than concerning Fanny Brawne. This is one of the most famed loves in history, freshly examined with the fairest look to date at Fanny's equally complicated character. Whether they take place in British rooms or Roman, the dramas within are drawn with lively and poignant detail. Special care is taken, too, to give Joseph Severn the full credit due for his constant vigil at Keats' long dying. To me, Severn's character was by far the most appealing, and Walsh's story left me certain that a steady, loving heart is genius of its own kind."
3,Southern Comfort - mmmmmmm,"Altho I didn't enjoy Zombified as much as I loved ""Liquored Up and Laquered Down,"" my introduction to this wonderful and unique group, there were still tracks that I liked a lot - especially the first one, ""Undertaker."" Loved the album cover. I would recommend it."
5,Great flavor and convenience,"I drink this stuff all the time. It has a great flavor and I even add powdered ginger to it sometimes if my stomach is a little touchy. I also love its convenience. I can carry the individual packets with me and put it in a bottle of water and have a nice beverage to drink. The value is great, too."
5,Great... Exept needed a little modifacation.,The case is perfect for the Flying V in every way except the strap holder notch in the inside foam triangle was in the wrong spot for my Epiphone 1958 Korina Flying V replica so i had to fix that. I'm sure that in a normal flying v the notch would fit perfectly without any modification. It looks great and does what it is supposed to do other one tiny issue.
3,Not a high quality case !,"I gave it an extra 3rd star only because it does do the basic job,Which is protection from light bumping around and storage. This case is not high quality. I would not use it for complete protection of an expensive or valued instrument that might be subjected to extreme weather or travel.I dont even like it for my new $540.00 (w/tax)Epiphone Korina V. The seams of the closed case are not air or water tight,and the top is not hard enough to be crush proof. I can get my fingers under the lid edge when closed and actually pull a small gap which Im sure water and air will be able to get in.I will shop for a real hard shell case for the Korina. It is over priced at $89.00 ($115.00 with shipping and tax,roughly) If you need anything more than to store it in your home,I would get a serious hard shell case...This Ain't it!"
4,Buy buy buy,"This album simply rocks,but its not the typical 'rockers' album. Album incorporates, a lot of 'groove' ('FAQ') and accessibility to tracks without the yawn of predictability that's found in popular music today. Then there are surprising moments like 'Emergence', where intense but subtle classical influences bring a trance-like ebb to the flow of poetic lyricism and and hard jammin' guitar. Neil Luckett's vocals are compelling and refreshing. Just get it!"
5,Great all-purpose wok!,"This is easy to handle, beautiful, has excellent non-stick, most useful everyday size. We have a large, two-handle All-Clad flat bottom wok for larger cooking endeavors."
3,Read Simple Justice,"Before delving into this book, I suggest that readers pick up and thoroughly digest Richard Kluger's Simple Justice, an epochal book on this topic. Kluger's book is absolutely brillant and extremely detailed with insights on Chief Justice Vinson and Chief Justice Warren's wrangling the Court for a unamimous decision, among many other subjects, including many of the cases that led up to Brown v. Board."
3,A MASTERING DISASTER,"I anxiously anticipated the release of this album only to be sorely disappointed by the amateurish mastering of the disc. Specifically, the volume levels are all over the place requiring manual adjustments for nearly every track. Collectors Choice re-issues are generally cobbled together but this one is exceptionally bad. Hold onto your vinyl copies until someone else gets it right."
3,"Decent product, but very cheap quality for price","Had a problem with plasma glow, first order shipped to me product was defective and was not working. Had to pay double shipping to return item to exchange for another one. New glowire came, was working but the material and power adapter was made of very very cheap quality. Glowire works now after I've wired it to my car, but I recommend just going to a car accessory store to buy this item rather than purchasing it online, It will save you the hassle of shipping costs and possible defects."
4,Suddenly one of my favorite songs,"I had never heard of Something Smith and the Redheads until my grandfather passed away. Always a gentleman and also a ladies man and likely a philanderer, grandpa asked in his will that a song be played at the funeral...that song was ""It's a sin to tell a lie"". The entire funeral went from sad, crying and memorial tributes to everyone shaking their heads and laughing. It seems the wonderful man that my grandpa was had to lighten the mood and give us one last pleasant memory of him even in death. I will never forget that song!"
4,Sauls daughter,"I would first like to say that my father, Saul Striks (he was the pianist and sang background vocals) loved music all of his life. He loved to talk about his time with ""Something Smith and the Redheads"".We lost him in 1980 when he suffered a massive heart attack during a trip to Chicago in hopes of getting a publisher to publish his book on music theory. Saul was a child prodogy and played with the Detroit Symphony at the age of 7.As far as the ""Come to Broadway"" CD not having the B-sides on the release is a huge mistake. Unfortunatly there will not be anymore music by this group which had great instrumental an vocal merit. Such tight harmony and enjoyable and fun music. This type of music will never die."
1,waste of money,"I like the feel of a gel wrist rest better than the foam or beads kind, but this one only lasted about 2 weeks before it split open and started oozing goo on my desk."
1,Not well made,"After barely weeks, one edge had begun to unravel...with gel oozing out. The seams are not well made. I have had somewhat better results with the Belkin F8E263-BLK Wave Rest Gel-Filled Cushion Wrist Rest Pad, a bit more comfortable, although one of the two I bought broke down at the edge after a year (not bad) and began to ooze gel. Belkin needs to think about having their Chinese manufacturing plant consider quality as part of the product."
2,Ok,"Item was very comfortable for typing. Problem I had was durability, after a few months, a small hole opened on it and gel started to come out. I taped back together, and then another hole opened on the other side, so i threw it out."
1,OLD (WINDOWS 95 COMPATIBLE) COULD NOT INSTALL,"Could not install it on Windows Vista. Compatible with Windows 95. Old, old, old. Waste of money."
5,"Love Reggae, Love Life, Love This CD!!","I have found that many of the songs written and performed by Mr. Anthony Thomas, aka Fragga Ranks, are chock full of highly intelligent lyrics. The beats and the roots rhythms are so full of energy and so real, ya just wanna move to them. The song Woman is so cute and funny to me. Unlike some of his other songs that are more serious, this one is just pure fun. I happen to love both styles, cause there's a time for fun, and a time for Focusing on the important things, Fragga seems to know how to combine it all and have a ball, just bouncing! He is an inspiration. May we be blessed."
1,The In Crowd,"It's surprising that this movie actually got a theatrical release. ""The In Crowd"" feels like a sub-par straight to video movie. It feels like the filmmakers couldn't decide whether to make a drama or a thriller. It ends up being neither. The drama parts are uninteresting, the ""thrills"" don't come until the last ten minutes and by then you've already lost all interest in the movie. The pace is sleep inducing. I'm sorry I wasted my time and I was glad when it was over. Don't waste your time and definately don't waste your money on it."
2,wait for cable.....,"Aside from a few attractive ""actors/actresses"" -- and I use these terms lightly, this film has little to offer. The acting was terrible, the plot was okay, but needed alot of work!!! There were holes in it.This is a cheap ripoff of ""Wild things"". They even went so far as to have a Denise Richards ripoff who was trying to hard to be Jason Vorhees.Don't waste your money, at least wait for it on HBO if you really are curious about it."
3,"beautiful cast in a ""melrose place"" plot","The in-crowd is a fine movie, with a beautiful cast and a melrose place plot. It does not mean it is boring--not at all! In this movie,a girl(Adrien) leaves a mental institution to work in a summer club, with lots of rich and clueless teens. Despite the fact she is an employee, she soon gets involved with those people, going to parties, hanging out with rich girls, etc. She meets Brittany, a rich and snobish girl who becomes her friend, and who does everything to get what she wants. This movie is really similar to ""wild things"", with kevin bacon and neve campbell, and makes you laugh, without huge expectations.Susan ward is incredible. She is naive, but at the same time extremaly dangerous and evil!"
2,The In Crowd,"To tell the absolute truth, I expected much more from this teen movie. I like those teen slasher movies like SCREAM and I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER, but this one was too weird and bizarre for my tastes. It was very well photographed and sometimes well directed, but the script and actors are very lame and really don't deliver anything special.It's the story of a former mental patient, Adrien, who is sent to work at a hip country club. She is soon involved in a wicked friendship with the sexy Brittany, who sees the image of someone else in Adrien, and therefore begins to act as her loyal companion. Through investigation and patience, Adrien finds that Brittany is nothing but an evil murderress.Like I said, the weak script and lack of talent in the actors destroy this would-be-good thriller. It's often suspenseful and sometimes scary, but usually it's quite boring and overly sexual to boot."
4,A gulity pleasure,"I bought this DVD to add to my collection.... What I found was a gulity litte pleasure in this moive.The basic plot is that a girl get out of mental ward gets a job and is benfriended by the delicous Susan Ward. When the new girl crosses Susan's chracter there's hell to pay. If this film had been rated R, had some nudity then it would did better at the box office but I liked it though...."
1,"Hands Down, Worst Film of 2000","i do not understand these reviews before mine praising this movie. it was the stupidest piece of trashy teen garbage i've seen in a long time. and it was pg-13 so it's like you know there won't be any nudity. it's cliche, predictable, boring, and just plain dumb. and it also has so many plot holes it's not funny. i was laughing very hard through this. and i don't think it was ever trying to be funny. and what is the thing with the hockey stick? she all of a sudden pulls out her,....hockey stick and smashes the window. why would she have a hockey stick. this is how dumb this movie is."
1,Movie Making at it's Worst,"I was dragged into this movie by friends and knew it would behorrible. The plot was worse than most daytime soap operas and theacting was less than par. It is obvious this movie was made for noother reason then to appeal to a teenage audiance. Random sex acts forno reason, a terribly unconvincing plot and actors who look good butcan't act for their lives. Never before have I seen such a terriblefilm....."
1,Overlong and boring,I had high hopes when sitting down to watch The In Crowd. But they were too high. The plot: Adrien is a young woman whom falls into the wrong group of teens when she gets a job at the local club. The In Crowd is just plain stupid. Very poorly written and acted. I should have listened to the critics.
1,Beautiful cast and nothing else,"I didn't like this movie and I am not going to spend a lot of time on an in depth review. But in summary:- the cast is beautiful and they keep hinting that you are going to get to see a lot of them acting very naughty ... but it never happens- the plot / mystery never develops- the acting is wooden and the dialog is uninspired, just what you would expect from a group of brand new actorsDon't waste your money. If some one gives you the movie then don't waste your time."
3,Lori Heuring,"Before I jump into this review, let me start by saying Lori Heuring is one hot actress! She's tall, lean and rather sexy.Now that I've gotten that off my chest, let's proceed into the interview. The In Crowd is a sexy thriller about a misconfirmed psychologically challenged girl (Lori Heuring) who gets a second chance. Starting a summer job as a waitress at a wealthy country club, she soon finds herself in a world that isn't truly what it seems. She is befriended by Brittany (Susan Ward) and introduced to the glamorous life. Adrien soon discovers that Brittany is more than just a pretty face and a deadly rivalry ensues as Adrien finds herself fighting for her life!This movie isn't as good as Wild Things or Cruel Intentions, but it is still worth checking out if you are looking to waste an hour and a half or so. The cast is very attractive and the plot is decent and well followed for the most part. I wouldn't recommend purchasing this movie but is definitely a decent choice for a rental."
1,what horrific garbage!,"while i was watching this movie i thought to myself, ""am i going to die? have i gone to horrible movie hell?"" you see i was trapped in a theater. it's like being tortured by some horrible nightmare but you can't leave cause B actors are pretending they can act just because they're fat. the in crowd gives you that feeling like when it's grossly bright outside and it's a sunday afternoon and you're in a car and you've been sitting for 6 hours and you feel sweaty and there'a a football game playing on the am radio and you want to escape. in conclusion, this movie turns me into melting snow. but i suppose there are worse movies-- (see my review on gummo)."
3,"Not excellent, but good","I wasn't expecting much from The In Crowd, and not much I got from it. But I've got to admit it: It was fun. This movie is a fast one, but takes you inside of it and you like the characters in it. If you're not expecting anything special, you won't be disappointed at all."
4,Susan Ward is HOT,"It's a fairly average ""thriller"" but for me, Susan Ward makes the movie. I really wish the US version had the full nudity in it. I also wish Susan would've gotten enough fame to STAR in more movies. She had a cute part in Shallow Hal but it was a small part. To me she should be in league with Megan Fox who doesn't make Jennifer's Body near as interesting as Susan makes this movie. At least that's my opinion."
3,The Stupid Crowd,"This movie is soo stupid, it is funny. The actors are lifeless and the plot is predictable. I don't really get who was crazy here, the Susan Ward character or the blond chick or maybe the producer for flushing so much money down the toliet. And how was she in? She killed someone to be in, as in what? I had to give it 3 stars because I laughed so much during the movie. Other than that, it is total garbage."
3,"A little slow, but what a finale!!","THis was a good teen thriller, but lacking excitement until the first 45 minutes or so. Susan Ward was so pretty, and she plays a good bad guy! I didn't see the dvd, but I can't wait! I heard there are only three deleted scenes, but I don't care! I loved this movie. I love the end credits song, Behind Every Good Woman by Tracey Bonham!!"
4,huh,"On a Sunday morning, in my PJ's with nothing else but old men sermonizing on tv---this movie is alright. Okay, Okay....I swore that I was only going to finish the movie since I'd already invested half an hour into it. Then, today, and it was on again. I was drawn. Upon my second viewing and although I must stress it's no great suspense thriller--still entertaining. Okay, okay I liked the gratuitous lesbianism (bisexuality) in the movie. The plot could have been prettier but it's not entirely guessable. At least in the beginning it's not clear who the antagonist/protagonist is. Good hook. Oy, so 4 stars. Cool."
5,Inspirational Song,"Westlife have done it again! This is the best song I've heard by these guys. Even my mom likes the song. It has a little bit of a gospel feel to it. It makes the song unique. Mark and Shane did an awesome job with the lead vocals on this song. If you're a Westlife fan and haven't heard this song yet, I definitely recommend buying this cd."
3,"Great music, good performance, awful recording.","I bought this recording after listening to a live performance broadcast from the UNAM Philarmonic Orchestra (OFUNAM). I was moved by the powerful music and determined to get myself a copy of this symphony.To my regret, I decided to buy this CD. As I mentioned earlier, the music is great and the performance is very good. Unfortunately, it is a very unbalanced recording volume-wise. You have to constantly juggle the volume to listen to some extremely low-volume parts being played and then immediately lower it to avoid deafness on the loud parts.Seriously, I had to turn the volume up to 100% to listen to some parts, then lower it at least to 50% on other parts. Very annoying. It ruins what should be an excellent listening experience.If you like this powerful symphony -and there are multiple reasons to enjoy it-, I recommend you get yourself another recording.This is a cheap CD and -unfortunately- it shows."
2,Why is it Connected?,"I waited almost a month for this item to come in. And when it did the darn thing was connected! Meaning the triangle is supposed to have a gap/not connected . My triangle was a fully connected triangle. I'm no musician, I only ordered the thing because I played it in music class in junior high and wanted to relive past memories. The sounds don't sound the same when its fully connected. I was going to try and get my money back by saying it was defective but I ended up misplacing it somewhere in my house."
5,"False Advertising by Amazon, Incorrect CD scam!!!","The Toasters are awesome, this compalation is excellent, But the CD amazon.com is selling you is not the right one,. it is some generic version!!! all the features stated in the editorial review are incorrect!!.. there is no metal Tin! its a paper sleeve! there are no picture cards of the band! there is no picture disc! the 21 tacks are there and thats about all! and amazon is no help. The real Tin version exsists but its out-of-print! so its impossible to find!"
1,Brainstorming: Techniques for New Ideas,"To brainstorm one would have to assume there is a brain involved. After reading this book I'm not too sure the author has one that functions properly. This book is filled with bad grammar, improper punctuation and misspelled words. The techniques were all lifted from other training manuals. Plagarism is a serious offense Timothy.I finish by saying anything in Tim's brain has to be stormy."
3,Unique Ideas Not for Everyone,"I have been in the business for a number of years and just wanted to inspire myself again. The book had ten different techniques which I found four that worked for me. The other six just didn't fit for me. The techniques are different but after taking some time to think about them I have had some success with them in creating ideas. I do think that they should give more indepth examples of ways in which each technique can be used but, I you are motivated to work at creating ideas these techniques work. If you are looking for the same old same old way we have always done things don't bother these are new unique ways at generating ideas and you do have to try."
2,This isn't one of Putney's best efforts,"I have enjoyed Mary Jo Putney books in the past but I just couldn't get into this book. I read part of it and put it aside while I read 3 or 4 other books. Then I came back to it and read a little bit more and it hit me that I was just trying to finish it so I could start reading something else that I could enjoy. At that point, I knew this was a book I would end up taking to Goodwill.Early in the book we are told that Gwynne will betray Duncan and throughout the book we are constantly reminded of that fact. I started thinking, ""Enough with the betrayal already! If she's gonna do it, just go ahead and do it!!!!"" By the time the ""betrayal"" finally comes it is terribly anticlimactic and you find yourself asking, ""Is that it? That's all there is to it?"" I was just very disappointed!Oh, and by the way, I have read all the other reviews and it seems everyone either LOVES this book or HATES it. Makes me wonder...did we all read the same book?"
2,What happened?,"I have read everything by Mary Jo Putney and somebody did something. This book reads like a really bad dimestore Novel. The characters are so textbook ""Bodice Ripper"", with (...) undeniable desire it is awful. No way I am buying another hardcover from her."
2,Is this a romance novel?,"I would not put this into a romance category. It belongs more into the historical fiction/fatanasy mixed with some elements of romance. It is sort of an adult Harry Potter with Scottish elements and some sex scenes thrown in.For the first 100 pages I loved it. I loved how the relationship was progressing, but the last 2/3 of the book were just plain and boring, filled with boring details of the uprising. After that I also started to just skim it.I guess if you like this kind of romance genre (history and fantasy combined), you will love this book. But if you like books that focus on the relationship between the characters alone then you will find that all the war and history stuff is just not as interesting. Maybe that makes me shallow, but please, I read romance novels for the, well, romance things, not for the wars and history. I have plenty of other, REAL books if I want to read that."
2,Nice start dire ending,"The first half of the book was amazing, the killings and the investigation as well. When Kraag starts to solve the case just because he is a shrink is out of reality but nevertheless the book is still readable. But the last part of the book, when all the uniform personnel of the USA goes to the farm to take Mike is foolish and so it is the whole negotiation with Moray to get Mike.At the end of the book just out of a sleight of hand appear the killer and everything you have read goes to the bin."
4,Excellent Choice,"This sleeping bag strikes the balance between cost and quality. I've slept snug as a bug in many different setting in this pack, from just under freezing to about 65F. The fleece pillow pocket is great for a folded up jacket, and the thermometer on the zipper is a nice touch. It's lightweight and compactable, perfect for backpacking. I plan on using it into the spring and summer, where it should be perfect for the cool evenings on the mountainside."
3,not a long term investment,"I bought one of these in April 2007 for my son who was then 10. In the past few months, the fabric has begun to fall apart by the seams. Other than that, he's been happy with it."
5,Nice Bag,"Bought this sleeping bag for a Cub Scout camp out I went on with my son, and I must say it performed just the way they say it would. Bag was warm and comfortable and WARM. I am 6'2"" 250 lbs and had no problems using it. Found this product on Eureka's own website for much more money as well. Worked well for what we will be doing, so although it might not be for everyone, it works for me."
3,Not for skinny guys,"I have taken this sleeping bag out on 6 or so weekend trips typically experiencing weather at or slightly above freezing. The temperature rating is closer to the mid 30's and not 15 degrees. I'm 6'3"", 195 pounds and I have too much room in the sleeping bag. It is about 5"" too long and I swim inside it. This is probably the biggest reason it stays chilly at night.The construction has been good until recently where the zipper teeth dislocated in the middle of the bag. Not a bad bag for the price though."
2,Bulky,"I ordered this bag hoping it would compress easily to a size small enough to fit in my hiking pack. I was a little disappointed with the bulky size. It was also pretty heavy. I also had some problems with the zipper sticking and the thermometer was missing from the zipper. This bag never made it to a campsite- I sent it back to Amazon yesterday. I am sure it would have been a warm bag, but I spent the extra money to get an ultra lightweight bag that fits into a well-designed compression sack."
4,Wilton Wedding Cakes,The customer service provided was excellent. The book has many traditional cakes for a traditional wedding.
5,Cool,This is an awesome pepper grinder. Totally top notch in every way. Glad I bought it! Had it like A few years and well worth the money for A good one. Can do course grind and chucky for steaks and as fine as ya want. One of the best things I bought on here.
5,"Informative-Funny-""He's called the Stig""","Informative-Funny-""He's called the Stig""....A classic UK petrol head show that works in informing the viewer of the best stuff with anything containing a engine. And, that is just the begining...."
4,They've come a long way.,"When watching a show here and there on BBC you lose how much they've changed over the years. Watching a few seasons back to back on my Kindle Fire i quickly realized how mature the formula has become. Not a knock, just that the earlier seasons seem more content and less fancy editing."
5,British top gear,"A fun show even if you aren't a car junkie. We enjoy the interactions of the hosts as much as seeing their ""adventures."""
1,Misleading,"The product page makes it seem as though you get switches, and not just the covers. I ordered this and only received switch covers with no switches."
3,"not a real ""red"" color","The switches i ordered arrived today. I really like the feel of the switch when activated and then de-activated. I have not installed them yet so I dont know if they work.However, one very BAD thing, the color is not a real Red color. It is an odd shade of a metallic red."
2,"Product OK, Labeling Bad","As the other reviewer stated the switch cover is actually plastic and not metal as the ""anodized"" portion of the description implies. The coating is simply metallic paint over a plastic switch cover.However, the switch itself is functional and serves its purpose."
2,Disappointed,I have had this shower filter for two years and now it is destined for a landfill. It looks as thought it is chrome but the connector piece is plastic and so is the body that houses the filter. This shower head is very fragile and broke twice on me. Once while adjusting the angle of the shower head the connector piece snapped in two and the second when attempting to change the filter the body of the shower head cracked. It is a shame that the durability of the product is so poor because it is an effective filter.
3,Does not work as pictured,"I had hoped that I could use the shower head as shown in the picture, but because of the weight of the shower head and the adjustable base, it tilts forward so far that it is not usable in this position. Unless I can find something to hold it upright, have to use it as a regular hand held shower. : Seems to work fine though and no leaks like I have had with other attachments."
4,TBD,"I just ordered 2 of these... but i went to the site directly because they have FREE SHIPPING on anythning over $60 (and I think for $59.99, too).PLUS I found a promo code for 5% off - so much cheaper at the site directly.The other option is a Culligan model for a bit less money, but it's plastic. Not sure what this one is, but I'm hoping for the $$ it is made better. I'll update once receieved."
2,Not for busy moms,"The pictures are beautiful, but with a small child at home, and working full time, there is not enough time to write something EVERY day. Every month-is perfect."
2,Good Book... but,I don't care too much for the cover. I don't look like this when pregnant and I don't know anyone who does. Would also prefer not to have this on the coffee table for my other kid-os to see. They like to read what is going on with Mommy and Baby....
3,Disappointed,"A little disappointed in the way he performed his old tunes. As a one time recording artist myself, the method and the way you delivered a song then..is what people want to hear now..Don't try to make it fancy..just keep it pure..like the original."
1,Sorry Gary!,"Some performers are able to keep our attention with their ongoing talent. Gary Puckett can't. If you enjoyed the original Gary, don't expect it with this CD. Buy the originals when he could keep up with the best. It's gone."
4,the 1960's,gary puckett is a great singer with great songs. i've liked this performance but i wish he sang it more like in his 1960's style. he could of talked less too. it takes away from the music. music should never be interrupted. i hope columbia will release gary puckett & the union gap in concert during their peak. enjoy.
1,The day is done,Do not watch this dvd ever. Save your money and buy something else. I recommend the 10 greatest hits of Gary Puckett and the Union Gap for about ten bucks. Remember him the way he was not the way he is. I saw Gary Puckett at the New York State Fair last year and he was so bad that people were laughing at him. He kept apologizing for his voice and the laughs were just louder and louder. I loved Gary Puckett in 1984 when he played with the Monkees and the Grass Roots and Herman's Hermits but the day is done now Gary Puckett. Please stop singing and retire your old tired voice and leave us with happy memories of days long gone by.
1,Gary had an off night,"Sorry, but Gary Puckett obviously had an off night when this concert was recorded. He hardly sounds like himself. At times he's even a bit off key.It's not just a matter of aging. I have CDs he has done in recent years and have heard him in concert, so I know he can sound even better than he did during his hit making years. It's just a shame they didn't record him in concert another night.Gary Puckett is one of my favorite singers, but I found this DVD unlistenable."
1,Gary Pucket and the Vocal Gap,"dont watch this, his voice is gone from all the bongs and partying of the 60's. Listen to the CD greatest hits and enjoy the memory of summer love!!"
3,Well...,"I didn't want to rate this DVD by indicating a particular number of stars because I can't be impartial. I purchased two copies of the DVD because I was photographed in the audience and was on a lot of ""footage."" (So if you view this video and see a very happy smiling face, it's ME!)The concert was wonderful in-person because of the excitement exuded by the audience and the joy in re-living the memories and the moment with Gary Puckett.SO, I had to balance the audio deficiencies with the overwhelming wonderful memories of seeing the live concert and the result was 3 SMILES...oops, I mean stars!"
3,Just a compilation,This is just a summarization of other sources. Nothing new or exciting here - at all.
2,A Dark Trip,"This is simulation of a NDE is far too dark for me. It would be a good soundtrack for a haunted house. I hope when I die It sounds nothing like this...I want a chorus of enlightened angels, not sad souls seeping through the floorboard."
1,"would love to review the item, but when i ordered it, i received the wrong item, and no one ever bothered to send the right item","The picture of the item, you're asking me to review, is the item that i ordered, but never received it. I received the under the desk manager, not the desktop mngr. Untill this day, no one has contacted me to get me the item that i ordered"
5,TOTALLY AWESOME!!!!!,Delivered quick....looks real good with my retro pink and black kitchen....comfortable chairs...really pretty table...can't help but say I love it!!!
3,"Nice table for the price, but be gentle.","I am satisfied with the table and the black chairs. I wish the chairs had a little more stuffing as the vinyl seems loose occasionally. The table is nice as well, but because it's wood on the inside, the top area is just a coating of sorts and can be damaged easily if you're not careful. I'd even imagine that the edge of the table will wear off (the white part) if you rest your forearm on it a lot. If you're on a budget. this is a nice setup. I bought it for the look and for something easy to clean with small children (the chairs) and that in the long run I won't feel to bad if it's scratched hear and there by them. One day though I'd invest in a higher quality version of a table and chairs like this."
5,A Well Deserved Rebirth,"About a half of a century ago I bought a Capital album (78RPM) entitled ""Songs of the Dinning Sisters"" that started my love affair with these unique and not sufficiently remembered artists. I was elated when my internet search uncovered this CD, my 78's having become almost inaudible. I only wish there were room for more of their very special renditions like ""Please Don't Talk About Me When I'm Gone"" and ""Do You Love Me."" Might another album be added to this treasure trove!"
5,Life Extension is always good!,I love anything by Life Extension as I loved the book. They do research and care about quality more than other companies who have their own agenda.
2,Not the original Avere Vent'Anni,"Before you purchase this movie know that it is an Americanized version of the original film that has been chopped up and reassembled into a ""G"" rated variation of the foreign film. Picture quality is okay, sound is good, format is view-able. Not the original film so for my money not worth the purchase price."
2,QC issues,"This DVD has a major defect. The movie has 11 chapters, but after chapter 10, the movie stops playing and returns to the DVD menu. That means to see the ending and the credits, you have to hit chapter skip or fast forward. The chapter select screen lists only chapters 1-10, so apparently someone didn't realize that the final scene was two chapters. This really takes away from the impact of the ending. Also, both discs in this 2-disc set are labeled ""Director's Cut"" (the theatrical version is on one of them, however). Hopefully Raro will correct these issues soon.The movie itself is a sexy and funny romp with a shocking and brutal ending (in the director's cut) that comes out of left field. It really is like watching an ""American Pie"" sequel that turns into ""Saw"" (or, more accurately, ""Last House on the Left"") at the end. Squeamish viewers beware! The theatrical version is dubbed in English and is shorn of the violent finale."
4,"In depth, but spotty coverage","I was surprised to find that no one has reviewed this book yet, even if it is out of print. I bought this book to supplement ""Sybase SQL Server 11 Unleashed"" by Rankins etc. While that book is better as a general overview of Sybase, this book covers certain topics in more detail.As such, Kirkwood's book is better suited to DBAs than developers. It covers topics such as integrity, cursors, datatypes, the threshold manager, auditing, security, backup and recovery, the optimizer, problem anticipation and solving, configuration parameters (useful!), creating databases, master database rebuilding, storage stuctures and indexing, multiuser issues (concurrency and memory) and other miscellaneous features.Negatives? Some topics that one would expect to be covered here are missing. Still, for DBAs, I would recommend this book to complement ""Sybase Unleashed"". I generally use both."
5,A Cultural Icon,"This CD is listening to a time capsule of one of our greatest cultural icons. Jimmy Durante's humor, wit, and inventiveness are well represented. You'll also find it astounding how many of his comic manglings of the english language are now commonly used by people in everyday conversation! The ""nice guy"" with the self-deprecating humor, Durante seems very genuine. He's really enjoying his work, and I think others will too."
4,Very good military documentary ...,"Normally seeing the Mill Creek label conjures up images of poor quality public domain content programs but here they actually manage to deliver a decent documentary with fairly good production values. Its essentially an imported Australian TV program that was released as "" Amazing World Of War Machines"" This is a list of things that are covered:Flint & steelRifles & machine gunsArtillery - Bombard to the howitzerFortification - Bollards to bunkersTanks and armoured carsBattleships and FlotillasSubmarines - The silent killerThe fighter planeThe bomber - fortress in the skyRockets and missilesAir defence and surveillanceNuclear - biological and chemical warfareFuture war and the roboMy only gripe is the cheap manner in which the DVDs are stored inside the case. But for $15 this is definitely an affordable 12 hour program that anybody can enjoy."
1,Customer Service Stinks-Product FAILED,I have had my MacBook for 6 years and only needed one cord. I ordered from this company to replace the original cord as it was worn from the dog chewing it. The cord that they sent lasted less than five months. I contacted them for a replacement and they didn't even bother to reply. Won't be ordering from them again.
1,Dangerous!,"This charger shorted out after a couple uses - sparks, smoke and now the plug is totally charred. Thankfully, my computer wasn't connected. I should have known better than to try a cut-price cord/charger :|"
1,Broke after a few months.,"Worked fine for about 4 months then just stopped working all together. No cracks or anything like that, just one day it decided to never work again. Certainly not worth the price."
1,Defective item,"Sent this as a gift, it seemed new and pretty, but when plugged it in and clicked it into the mac it had an orange light then nothing. It was just plain defective. The three prong plug and the two prong were tried, neither would charge the mac."
4,Works as promoted,"Not much to say. It works just fine: I can't tell the difference between it and a ""standard"" apple product, and my computer is working again."
4,Does what a replacement should,"My wife's white Macbook's original power adapter's cable ripped and was no longer reliable, so we needed to get a new one. Luckily, I checked Amazon before I checked out at Best Buy and paid full price. This is a valid genuine Apple replacement adapter, just at a cheaper price.I'm not rating the design of the adapter. This product, however, does what it should -- it replaces a faulty power adapter for a Macbook."
1,macbook power cord rot,"Both of my children have macbooks, they use them at home, and they are careful enough with them. BUT, the power cord adapters keep breaking, fraying off at the point where the wire and the connector meet. At first I thought maybe the children were mishandling them, but after the first go-round, they were so careful, and still the problem returns. At $80 a whack, this is getting outrageous! And using a frayed adapter is dangerous, no?? Hello... Apple... wake-up on this issue...this is a defective product and needs a recall/reissue."
4,great product,"This product works great. It gets the job done. I don't like the way the part that plugs into the wall is made because it easily comes loose, but what can ya do? Oh well...as long as it keeps my computer charged, I'm happy."
2,Get a new one,I had this product for seven months and it died. This was is just like the old original charger and has all the same weak points including the weak connect at the neck of the wire and flimsy wire itself. I have since purchased new charger from the apple store for $29.00 more. The quality of the new and improved version is evident right out of the box it has a thicker wire and a new neck at the connection site. My recommendation is spend the extra $29 and get the new and improved version if your keeping your old macbook for awhile.
3,"Mine did not work, quickly replaced by seller","This charger never worked. It cycles between orange light, green light or no light and does not charge any macbook. The main white box appears scuffed up. I'm tired of paying apple $80 once every year or so when these things stop working, but it looks like that's a better deal than trying to find cheap ones like this.Edit: I contacted the seller for a return and it was handled very professionally. They sent the new one as soon as I gave them my word that I had shipped the broken one back (more than most well-known companies are willing to do). The box on the new one is scuffed again (implying that these are repaired, not genuine new parts), but this one works flawlessly so far. Looking at other reviews, it sounds like a lot of people get duds from this seller. So buy at your own risk, but keep in mind that they will work very hard to get you a replacement in the least amount of time if there is a problem. I'll update if the new one fails any time soon."
1,Two defective chargers,"I usually do not put too much stock in the one star reviews, but in this case I should have. I ordered this charger from a third-party vendor and received a defective unit. The charger only came with the DC part of the cord and after plugging it in, it overheated within an hour or two to the point where it was shorting out my touchpad and burning up so hot I couldn't touch it. After a day of switching back and forth between my work Powerbook charger and the knock-off and still having major overheating issues, I returned the unit to the seller for a replacement.This particular seller was initially helpful, but then failed to send a replacement unit for several weeks. Finally after contacting the seller again, they resent another charger, only for me to discover that it too was defective. The second unit also overheated after 20 minutes or so. Do not buy this charger from this vendor - buy it from Apple or another reputable source."
1,Stopped Working after 1 month. Don't buy!,"Ordered this mac charger from KC trade. Do NOT buy from them! It worked great for about a month and a half. Then just stopped working. There was nothing notably wrong with it, it just stopped charging my computer. I am unable to return it because it is just past the 30 day return period. Now I have to buy a new one, but I will make sure I do so from a different seller!"
2,Did not ship what I bought!,"I paid for a T shaped adapter and instead got an L shaped one. It does the job (as for now) but it is NOT what I paid for. I am surprised, being this an item that is ""fullfilled"" by amazon. It is Chinese.....but what isn't today!! It has work fine, have not charged my computer more than 5 times so I cannot write about heating issues....."
1,Works but doesnt last very long..,The charger worked well for the few months I have owned it - I have been super careful with all the attachments so that I am not pulling on them and it has still stopped working after less than 6 months. Definitely wouldn't buy it again. For the price it should have lasted longer.
1,Crap,"Have only had it for a few months and it suddenly stopped working, now I'm screwed and have to look and pay for another new one...absolutely ridiculous!"
1,"Lasted 91 days, then dead",Worked great until it stopped stopped working out of no where. It was plugged in at my desk not being moved or unplugged for about three days when it stopped charging.
1,doesn't last long,"I loved this charger when it first arrived. I ordered it only 3 months ago and already it doesn't work. It shorts out and doesn't charge my computer. Waste of money. I tried to contact the seller, never heard anything back. Better customer service is needed."
1,$70 for 2 months..,"My first charger lasted over 2 years, then got mixed up when I was among other macbook users, and I ended up with a broken one that did not belong to me in the first place. I was thoroughly frustrated with this, but sucked it up and bought another Apple charger. 2 months later, my charger stops working for absolutely no reason.I'm considering buying an off-brand, but they don't seem too much better. Hey, if it will last me more than two months though...Thanks a lot Apple. Please MAKE A CHARGER THAT IS RELIABLE so I don't have to spend $140 in a year on chargers!"
3,Not new. Beware.,"Against what the seller may say, this product is not new. I received my adapter with scratches all over. It works, but for how long? Only time will tell.They also package it with knockoff accessories. The little bit that plugs it into the wall is a knockoff, as well as the extension bit. Enter at your own risk: used adapters with new knockoff bits. Mine still works and that's about all I can say."
2,stopped working in a week,"My original charger had stopped working so I bought this, but it stopped working too in just one week. My MacBook works fine with a MacBook Pro charger I borrow, so I blame this product. I will try buying a 85W adapter and hope that it works."
3,Fickle Fickle,"After being Mac-less for almost a month, I was desperate to get a charger so I could be re-united with my dear laptop. I didn't want to pay full price for a new one & happened to stumble across this product. It works! BUT not all the time. I'll plug it in & it fits, charges, & works great... but it if gets pulled out of the magnet & I plug it back in, it doesn't work. I have to find another outlet & try with that one. Sometimes it goes right back to charging, other times it doesn't. It's picky about which outlet it wants to work in or if it even wants to work at the moment at all! If I plug it in & it doesn't work, I leave it in anyways & usually within a relatively short amount of time it starts to charge. All I can say is I've learned to work with it & am happy to have my Mac back :)"
3,These just keep breaking and breaking.,"I am on my 3rd or 4th power adapter. They just keep breaking. I have to have one, so it is usually hooked up all day. However, it is a flaw in the design and they break after about a year."
2,Not what was described,"The product description indicates 60w power cord and when I received it, it is an 80w. The product is not what was indicated. Fast and reliable shipping which was nice."
2,stopped working week later,hmm...stopped working literally a week after i got it..luckily i was able to exchange in an apple store...i dont know if the guy was just being nice and let me but i think i lucked out....
1,FAKE,"This seller is selling fake adapters. They sell them as originals and tell you they are original. It is not true. The shipment arrived on time. When I opened it came in just a cheap transparent plastic. Not a box. It weighted much less that usual. It seemed already strange.It worked for 3 weeks only, after that the small tiny metal tips made of a hard metal on the extreme of the cable that connects with the computer broke. I took it to a apple store. They confirmed me that it was fake. They opened and the object had only one small resistance.The object looks almost real but it is not.I filled a claim with the Store AMILENE, they returned me the money.Just do not waste your time with this people.I believe AMAZON should really take care of these issues. It is not fair, not professional not worth it for us, the clients neither for AMAZON to have these kind of sellers."
1,Works but lacking,I purchased this item and it does work however it did NOT come with the adaptor cord as it shows in the picture. I feel that if you include a picture of the adaptor cord then it should come with it. That was not the case. The actual charger works fine but shows signs of wear.
2,Gets too hot!,I just received this product today. I didn't come with the second cord. But that's OK. What concerns me is how hot the unit gets in just a couple of hours of charging. It seems way too hot to me. Buyer beware.One more item to note is that the device sparked both times I plugged it into the wall socket.***UPDATE*** Excellent customer service by the seller. I wrote to them with my concern and they took immediate action to address my concern with product. Five stars for customer service.
3,"Good item, but damaged.","It is useful, but the cord has a break in the wire coating. As a result it does not always charge if there is any pressure on the cord."
1,Piece of junk is used!,"I thought I was buying a brand new charger from these people with all components. It was not clearly stated what I was purchasing. Now, I have to go and buy another one because I can barely use this piece of junk which doesn't charge very well anyways. I tried to contact the company, but they were making any possibility of a return very difficult for me. I would never ever buy from them again unless they miraculously fix this problem, but I don't see that happening. They only got one star because something arrived. Not that it is what I wanted."
2,Breaks Easily,"the 'MagSafe' feature is really impressive but the cord is sort of weak.You will have to be careful while using it specially because of the price, $80+ per adapter! I am on my third one right now. It was always the same problem.You might want to tape a thick layer around where cable attaches to the connector."
1,Cheap knock off,"This is not a product from Apple, but obviously a generic knock off. It heats up fast, the little light stays on continuously, and there are pieces of plastic bouncing around in the power supply. All in all, you get what you pay for. Cheap knock off, cheap product."
1,Pretty sure that this is some off-brand knockoff...,"But I have to admit that it did the job. I'm sick of paying upwards of $80 for a poorly designed Apple brand charger, so I was happy to pay $40 for an identical off-brand charger. Cant say I've had problems with it yet, although it is a little bizarre that the green ""charging"" light on the magsafe end stays lit even when the charger isn't plugged into my computer.Edit: I had to edit this review after the product stopped working only two months after I bought it. Waste of my money."
4,Works great!,I have had this for a few months now and it works great. I have had no issues so far. It is a good macbook charger replacement at a good price especially compared to the apple store. I do wish it came with the extended cord to connect to the wall.
4,will work with Macbook Pro 13,"This adapter works fine with my macbook pro 13. However, the form factor is the old power adapter, not the new power adapter.I just need a spare for the office, and it was better to buy it used/lower price than to spend $80 for a new one or buy one from the Apple Store."
3,Why sacrifice durability for style?,"I've always thought Apple just seemed to get things right in terms of being (somewhat?) environmentally conscious, while making premium products in both appearance and performance...until recently. Since purchasing my Macbook I've always been a bit bitter about my taste for craftsmanship in computers. Apple accomplishes a lot, and fits it all inside an aesthetic and most times unbelievably-small package. However, I feel like they are being a bit hypocritical when they make products that last only a few years (how many iPods just up and fail for no reason?) and then have to be replaced.The Macbook performs well but I didn't expect the battery to be useless after 2.5 years, and the power cord to split at 3.5 years. And it's not cheap to replace these parts at all.Amazon is a great service and the product was delivered promptly."
4,I don't get it,"I've been using the charger that came with my Macbook for at least two, maybe three years now, and it's only just now starting to give out a little. I mean, obviously it would've been nice if it had lasted longer, but I don't think two to three years is too bad of a run. None of my friends with Macbooks (and I have several) have this problem either. What are you people doing to make your chargers die so early? Stop yanking at them, jeez."
4,Apple 60W Charger,"This charger is the exact same charger that originally came with my macbook. The charger design in itself is flimsy, but DealBarn delivered what they advertised. A good ""replacement"" charger. *It does not come with the extension cable* Overall good price, for the product."
2,Worked for almost a year...then died,"While it did work fine, it managed to stop working just under a year from when I got it. For the price I paid for the original, I expect it to last longer. Apple needs to do better"
5,Perfect replacement,"As with most of the older Mac power adapters - my cable frayed and the adapter quit working. I looked on here to find a genuine Apple adapter and I actually found one at a great price and it is the newer (""L"") style. It works so great I ordered another one!"
1,Delivered Product does not match the pictures,Careful -- if you just look at the pictures you may be fooled (I was) into thinking this is a MAGSAFE2 cable - it is not.
2,power adaptor,"it worked for five months or so, but is currently dead, and i can't figure out why. too bad for me."
5,Works great. No overheating,This works great with no overheating. The weak link has always been the cord joint near the adapter so you need to be careful with all these adapters not to wrap up the cord too tightly.
1,junk,"Used for less than a month, then suddenly stopped working. Took a risk not buying from apple, and paid for it."
1,defective item,item received appeared to be an apple mac charger. But it did not work on any of my apple computers.
1,Not sure what the issue was,"I bought this for my macbook I bought in 2007. It seemed to be the legit thing... Apple product. But for some reason it wouldn't continue charging after about 20 min.. it also had exuded an extremely high frequency when it was plugged in. The hiss was around 18 khz, so some people would even hear it.The company did return my money within a few days of the return though... great customer service. Not sure what the issue was with the product."
2,Lasted about two weeks . . .,"Glad the adapter was fulfilled through Amazon, because I knew if there was a problem, I could return it . . . sure enough, the adapter lasted about two weeks before it started to spark and not charge at all . . . =("
1,The seller shipped me a broken one!,"I tried this adapter, and it doesn't work at all. And of course it's not my macbook's problem, because I can use another adapter very well. It's not a new adapter for sure. It has scratches on it. This is the worst stuff I bought in Amazon ever!"
5,Great additional adapter,My wife and I both use Macbook Pros. We often have to work from home. It is so much easier to have an extra adapter so we can leave the main adapter in the office. The adapter purchased from Amazon was identical to the one shipped with the computer and works just as well. We have had no problems with the adapter. It works great.
5,Genuine Apple product,"After reading all the reviews for all the other aftermarket Macbook chargers, I didn't want to go there. I've got to say, I'm very happy I went with the genuine Apple one. And what a great price for it too."
3,Apple Power Adapter,"This item does work well, but this is a knock-off of the apple product. I kind of feel fooled by the picture, because it shows an apple adapter... again, this is not an apple product."
1,Power cord with a tendency to burn,"I have had two of these power cords and both have burned. The first after about a year of use, the second after three years of normal use. There was a class action lawsuit related to this power adapter because these cords have a tendency to fray and then burn. [...] Apple refuses to replace the adapter, saying that the problem was cause by misuse, and that I must have unplugged it from my computer incorrectly. Apple makes products that fail in dangerous ways and then refuses to accept financial responsibility for them. Think twice about buying Apple products."
3,works fine,Problem appears to be with the design. Hope this lasts fairly long because the newly redesigned ones from Mac do not fit with a protective cover on the computer.
3,Lord of the Power Adapters,"It's a good product. Just don't lose the little prongs that go into the outlet! You're in trouble if that happens! I'm pretty sure that the MagSafe has saved me at least five times since I've had a MacBook. Good job, Apple!"
1,doesn't work right,The connector to the computer doesn't stay in position so it won't charge the battery. I emailed to tell them of my issue and i got a generic message asking me to send photos of the issue. you can't send a photo of that. It was an original mac cord it just wasn't wanting to charge my computer.
3,Weird,"Okay - So I took a chance and bought this charger as it seemed like the only ""genuine"" charger for less than 79 dollars. After reading a mix of reviews (mostly 5 star or 1 star)Just received it minutes ago in a tiny flat rate box (no padding or bubble wrap involved).The charger is still in its clear packaging and this review is for the condition of the product.There's a tiny tiny cut on the extension cord, dunno why. still gonna use it.The reason I gave this product a 3 star review - I was sick of worrying about the authenticity of the product, and it was strange for it to have a million different reviews, and hope it doesn't melt randomly which it might so whatever.bye,foxeatsquab"
1,Embarassing,"I've gone through at least 5 replacement adaptors for my macbook pro. They last on average 2 years, if I'm lucky. Expensive piece of junk. Inconsistent, unreliable and just prone to suddenly not working ever again. I'm embarrassed to have been such a staunch Apple customer."
5,The charger works great.,"I chose this product because I think that it is an original apple charger and its has a good price. I like it very much, the charger has not given me problems so far and I hope it stays that way."
2,Charger,"The charger works fine on my 2007 macbook. It's been working fine since the 1st quarter of this year. The light when charging does not come on to indicate it is charging at times, but otherwise everything else is fine. A safe choice if you're looking for a cheap charger. Worth the buck for the bang."
4,Exactly What I Needed,"As described, this was a genuine Apple product, purchased as a replacement for when my original power cord became worn out and died (after 2 or so years). I have been using it for a week, and have no complaints---it's been working just fine, exactly like my original. If you don't need an extension cord, just the basic power adapter, I would highly recommend this product as a replacement, as it's half of the full retail price."
1,Poor product,"Broke a month after use. I would try to find a better, newer ac than this one. I can't see how the poor design or flimsy materials could last anyone very long."
1,Piece of junk,This has got to be a fake product. It says Made in Japan but it is lies. Japan has way better QA that would never have let such an inferior product see the light of day.Not only would Japan reject this junk but so would UL. The plastic is so cheap and falls apart creating a serious electrical hazard as it leaves electrical connectors fully exposed. My wife nearly got electrocuted trying to remove the remaining pieces that were still stuck in the electrical outlet.AVOID THIS PRODUCT IF YOU HAVE CHILDREN AROUND!!!
1,Absolute crap!,"I really enjoy the idea of this item as it will definitely save some careless people headaches. However, I have two MacBooks in my home and have gone through six of these adaptors in eight months, which breaks down to 1.33 a month! The cords consistently separate at the connecter. I suppose if your laptop remained on a desk and you didn't travel a lot it'd last longer. They need to reinforce the wire where the cord and the adaptor tip meet. I would NOT buy one of these as an extra one, because it is highly probable you'll have an issue and if you buy them over the counter you only get a 14 day return policy. At least with the MacBook purchase it covers you from one-three years depending on if you bought AppleCare."
1,False Advertising and Tedious Exchange Process,"MLC Distribution shamelessly misrepresents the nature of this product. They attempt to pass it off as a new adapter by having Amazon list it as a new product. In fact, it is a used power adapter that has been refurbished. When the adapter arrived, I could clearly tell it was used due to the excessive scratches and other marks. I decided to keep it, despite the false advertising, since I really needed to use my computer. However, after using it for a few days, the adapter stopped working. MLC surprisingly agreed to replace it when I contacted them via email, but they were only paying lip service, as the exchange turned out to be the most tedious and time-consuming transaction I've been involved in."
3,Extend Its Life By A Little Bit...,"As other reviewers have mentioned, there's a pretty serious design flaw in the unit, but you're kind of stuck. You have to have this power supply for your MacBook.I've been through a good number of power supplies in the four years since I got my MacBook.The most common fail-point is where the thin insulated wire leaves the square power supply. Constant turning and twisting degrade the insulation and eventually the wire itself.I've gotten a little extra life out of supplies by wrapping that end heavily in electrician's tape. This doesn't really strengthen the wire itself, and it will still fail at that point eventually. But if you put enough tape on there it does keep you from twisting it quite so much and improves the life a little."
3,stopped working,"The item came to me pretty quickly and I was using it for about a month. One day I went to plug the power adapter into my macbook and it was not working. I had saved the receipt and went back to it and found that there were a 6 month warranty. I emailed the company and they got back to me right away, letting me know that they were going to honor the warranty and send me a new charger free of charge. So I have no complaints about the company, only the faulty product that I received."
5,Must have at least one extra,"I've had two of these since we bought a MacBook November 2006. They've both worked great at the office, at home, and on the road, never any problems."
2,Fake product,Make no mistake. This is not an Apple product. It does not stay connected to my MacBookand charges very slow. So disappointed.
1,Please do not purchase this product,"Go buy the charger from apple or best buy, whatever you do do not purchase it from this vendor. The first charger I received sparked and eventually stopped working the second replacement, upon arrival was broken. Save yourself the hassle and buy it from the store or try a different vendor."
1,I don't think I got what I ordered,"I did not receive what was pictured. What I received doesn't actually charge my computer, it just powers the computer while it's plugged in. I decided to keep it because I probably won't have this computer too much longer. But, if you think you're purchasing an actual charger, I suggest purchasing something else.I may have been confused about what I was purchasing when I placed the order, but what they show in the picture is an actual charger and what I received looks different."
2,Crapped the bed,"I purchased the power adapter a month ago, and it has already crapped the bed. I'll be contacting the seller to see if they'll either refund my money, or send me another. It appears that the product is an actual Apple adapter, which is sort of odd because typically their stuffs last a long time (the first one didn't die on it's own, my beloved mutt ate it for breakfast). Overall, I'm pretty disappointed, but I'll give the seller a chance to make it right. Hopefully, they'll oblige."
2,Mac Power Cord,"Unfortunately this item was not a good purchase for me. It took a long time to get here (albeit within the range of shipping dates - roughly about two weeks) and then the cord got a tear in the middle of it within the first few weeks and stopped working. Their customer service was prompt and helpful and I was able to return it. As of yet, I have not received the credit, but I just returned it a couple of days ago. I can only guess that the cord had not been stored properly and the rubber surrounding the wires cracked when it was finally used.Never received the refund for this. Warning: Do not buy this product from this seller!"
2,It lasted 6 months,The charger would lose connection and I would have to toy with it to return the computer to charging. Compared to other reviews I was happy it lasted as long as it did. It was charging and then it just stopped. I decided to go with the new official Apple charger at least it has a one-year warranty that will benefit me if it dies as quickly as this one did.
2,Not completely new,"The extension cable that came with my power adapter is obviously (although not blatantly) used. After I realized this I purchased a new AC adapter directly form Apple and realized that this one is clearly used since the new AC adapters use a new style wall plug compared to the old style.It doesn't matter apparently, as a few days after I purchased this, Amazon has stopped selling it, in favor of a more expensive (actual MSRP) versions that claims to be in retail packaging. Maybe enough people returned this item and they were sick of it.It's ironic that I only came to review this item because I got an e-mail from MLC distributing (the company these were sold by, but through Amazon) before they were discontinued on this site)."
1,replaced once already...will have to do it again,i hate the fact that it costs $80 to get an apple cord replaced so i was so happy to find this for $40.After only a few months use the wire that connects that large part came loose and stopped working. I had it replaced after that - which was only a few months ago - and the same thing is starting to happen AGAINI will definitely go buy myself the actual apple cord after this goes.
1,This is not an original Apple Part - Misleading,The charger is not the same as pictured. Beware - not a genuine apple adapter.This is fraud - they show one picture and send another part. The adapter doesn't look like the picturethe part that plugs into the computer is completely different.Stay away from this seller.
1,Died,I am a college student. Last night this product just stopped working. Nothing was moved. I was in the middle of doing homework it got too hot and stopped working. Even after cooling off it won't work. I am pretty sure it was fried. I only had this for about three months.
2,Shipped without authentic long AC cord,"The longer AC cord that was included does not appear to be an authentic Apple cord. Since I have one from the previous adapter, I am using my older one. The transformer appears to be authentic. If I noticed the other negative comment I would not have ordered from this seller (Nextop2100)."
1,Horrible! Worked only for two months!,"Thing broke just past the return date. I opened it up and compared it to a REAL OEM charger. Turns out they are nothing a like. This one is missing the copper shielding and the components were different. This is false advertising!!! The charger is not apple as far as I can tell. After buying another non apple charger and seeing it almost catch my house on fire... I broke down and bought a real apple charger from the store.... take it from me, bight the bullet and get one from Steve Jobs... RIP...."
1,not sure...,"if it wasn't the fact the company lied about what kind of adapter or connector it was, it wouldn't have been an issue I believe, double check items before you buy them."
1,Overheated,Had it four months and it overheated and stopped working. I am very disappointed and will now need yet another charger.
1,NOT THE ITEM PICTURED,"This is NOT the pictured power adapter which would be for the newer MacBooks, it is the OLDER version with the OLDER magsafe adapter, meaning it WILL NOT WORK with new laptops."
1,DO NOT BOTHER.,"The photo is misleading. It is NOT an Apple product.Cheaply made and broke after a month.Does not have an option of attaching to the longer Apple extension cord (not sure what to call it?)Overall, DEFINITELY not worth it.I should have just spent the extra on a real Apple cord."
5,WOW!!!,"I'm SO impressed!! The charger looks a little ""used"" but other than that it's GREAT! I love the ""mac magsaver"" on the end so it won't break hopefully as fast as my old one! Also, I can't believe how FAST it shipped!!!!!! I'm actually not sure how it even got all the way across the country as fast as it did!! lol. THANKS SO MUCH!!!!!!! GREAT GREAT SELLER!"
1,Not Pleased,"The charger I bought was defective in less than 90 days, and even though I tried to contact the seller multiple times for a refund, they never replied. I don't recommend this seller at all. Very unsatisfied."
3,"This is a review of the Book ""The Earliest Americans""","I believed that this book was very factual and informational. I thought that the author was a little repetative in some of the points she tried to make, but for the most part it was a good source and it would be an excellent guide for school projects and essays. There were a lot of descriptive and entertaining illistrations that you could refer to to understand the text better. Overall, this book was worth the time to read it.hannah D."
5,Build your collection around this book!,"James Green has created an exhaustive index of herbs in a book I've gone back to hundreds of times. Very readable and down-to-earth, James combines good science with great advice. Includes much information of male-specific maladies (e.g. prostate) and insights into lifestyles that contribute to problems. Many recipies for daily herbal health-maintanance are tried and true. Simply the best and my personal favorite."
2,"Prostate, anyone?","I bought this book in an attempt to locate herbal remedies specifically designed for my husband in mind. That is not what I found with this book. This book has two primary themes throughout the whole book: Prostate and erectile dysfunction. There are almost little to no remedies for men that are not prostate nor erectile dysfunction related. I understand that those are two concerns for men. If that is what you are seeking in a book, then the ""Male Herbal"" is for you. If you, like me, are looking for a book with more helpful remedies I suggest that, like me, you look elsewhere."
2,old edition,"didn't realize the copy edition , has been revised many times since..thank you and blessings.was looking for remedy for tinnitus, which was in my last copy borrowed and never returned.this copy has no remedy."
3,The secrets of Evermeet revealed.,"The reason I gave this book such a low score is this. You really don't need it to run a AD&D campaign. It is really interesting, especally to elf nuts like me, but really it is completely unneeded for any AD&D campaign. This is manily because it is rare for any race besides elves to go to Evermeet, and if elves go there they normally don't leave."
4,cool track,"i was hyped when this was about to be coming out, big time barry white fan and this song got much play in 99,00 and so on.rip to one of the greatest musicians,artist,"
1,Horrible,"This movie is perhaps the worst I've ever seen. The plot is thin and the film quality terrible. The dubbing is quite bad at times also. The film also comes to an abrupt ending, ie. you don't think the movie is over and suddenly the credits begin to play. Did they just run out of film and have to end it? Certainly it was low budget.I guess this movie could be entertaining if you want to watch it for the purpose of making fun of how bad it is. Other than that, please stay away from it. It makes movies like ""Attack of the Killer Tomatoes"" look like award-winning films."
2,Watch out for calculation errors...,"While this book contains wonderfully simple explanations of some very complex theories and ideas, there are several errors in the sample calculations that make me wonder how carefully it was edited. I found no less than five errors in calculations in their ""model answers"" and some of them were incredibly simple (36+3=39, not 38).I would recommend Tests and Measurements For People Who (Think They) Hate Tests and Measurement instead if you're looking for a user-friendly guide. Calculation errors are NOT user-friendly."
3,Not quite enough...,"This book was required for one of my courses on research design. Unfortunately I didn't find it helpful because it was too basic. In trying so hard to be user-friendly, I think the author dropped lot of the needed detail."
3,Just average,"I was expecting the great dance remixes that I've heard of this song, but it only has four slower remix versions. They're good, but not great and not the club tracks."
3,Solid Tips--Even If You Have Heard Them Before.,"Why Didn't I Think of That contains many good tips--and some that can be found in other cruising books and publications. It's value is that they are all in one place and reasonably well organized. The author's writing style, layout and illustrations make for easy reading. It is worth reading and will be a handy reference."
3,Some helpful hints... Some not so helpful...,"I was a little disappointed in the quality of ""hints"". Some seem as though they were included just to fill up space on the page."
4,Ferret Chronicles,"This is amusing reading for those who enjoy adventure and/or flying. I'm not sure what the point of substituting ferrets for peoples means. However, once you accept this premise (i.e. the suspension of disbeief) then the story is much more enjoyable. This is almost more of a short story, than a book. The book is only about 135 pages. I like the author, Richard Bach. I have read many of his books, and have never been disappointed."
5,These ferrets charm and this author is a true storyteller,"Bach's Ferret Chronicles are full of wisdom and adventure. This one is no exception. The worst thing about this neat little volume is knowing it was the last of his series of Ferret Chronicles - for now, at least. Richard, bring your buddies back, please!"
3,Doesn't work well with SBC ...,If you are an SBC internet user I would recomend buying another camera. SBC does not support logitech cameras and I am unable to send video e-mail which kind of defeats the purpose of the thing.
3,Problems with Delivery,"Ich hatte Probleme bei der Auslieferung und mußte UPS die Lieferadresse mitteilen, damit es dem Empfänger zugestellt werden konnte."
5,Excellent image Quality! Buy it!,"One of my friends had the camera before an i was impressed with the quality of the image, also has a light boost that is excellent at night time."
5,Better than expected,"This camera is great. Much better than I expected. Picture quality and sound is perfect. The only thing that could be better is the stand it doesn't clip well to a laptop it balances, but overall a great value."
1,Affects stability of the system,"I installed the drivers (from the CD supplied with the package) and my computer crashed! I am using windows XP. At first I didn't know that the reason was this camera. I reinstalled windows, downloaded latest drivers of STX from Logitech's website, reinstalled the software and the drivers and my windows (XP) is about to crash again. Then I learned from some computer geeks that Logitech drivers are notorious for this. Keep that in mind, before purchasing this item."
5,Simple to use and Economical,"This webcam is easy to operate, priced just right, and works perfect. Highly recommend to others."
4,Good purchase,"Good picture quality, built-in microphone is convenient. Not sure how to mount it to laptop."
4,Logitech Web Cams,Works fine for the price. The top of the line Quick Cam with face tracking is better.
3,Laggy Webcam,"The Logitech QuickCam software is only so-so. The camera doesn't really have a good framerate and it is jumpy. I never used it much because it is so bad.It also fell off my monitor once because the two front ""prongs"" are so short. It fell from about 4-5' up to the floor (carpet) and it still worked, so it is pretty durable."
2,"Simple, yet cheap","For taking quick snap shots, it works. But any webcam can take simple snap shots. Video is poor and there are YouTube Videos which have been done better, then what this cam will provide."
3,"Great for WinXP, not compatible with Vista.","I bought this camera about four years ago, and it was great, but I didn't need it anymore so I stopped using it for a while. I had to get a new computer and decided to install my webcam so I can chat with a friend on Yahoo, except the driver won't work and the one I installed from the website isn't any better. Don't buy this webcam if you use Vista, but it works great on WinXP. It doesn't have the greatest quality but it's not horrible either."
1,"Great camera, base could be better -- breaks after a year!","This is a very good camera, and the price is just right. The one flaw I see in it is its base for the laptop... I felt it could have been better designed. The camera turns ok but again, could have more freedom in its movement. And the cam itself could be less bulky.------------------EDIT: Had this camera for a year and even bought one for my mother. Both of these broke after a year! -- A rip-off."
5,Works well,"The logitech is a good product. It is small, and fits nicely atop my computer. All I need say is it works well."
4,WebCam,I have had this webcam for about a month and it works pretty well so far. The room just needs to have ample light. The built in mic seems to be able to pick up nicely considering it is all inclusive. This is my first webcam and am pretty happy with it. So far so good. Good luck.
4,My Fault,I think the camera is good. Easy to set up but in my case I was trying to use this to communicate with a PC and some Macs. Couldnt get it to work despite days and tons of video ISP's.
2,Horrible audio on Notebook Computers,"Bought two Quickcam STX to run on two different notebook computers (a Sony and an HP). Both experienced horrible audio static (hissing) after about 10 seconds on MSN Messenger. Also had the problem on audio capture software. After numerous attempts at solving the problem we gave up and returned both units. Some internet research revealed this to be a common problem for notebook computer users. I must say that the Video was quite good. If not for the audio problems, it's a winner. Notebook computer users beware."
1,Do you need a nightmare?,"I bought it from amazon. I spent two frustrating days trying to install it. All went fine until the camera recognition. I got all kind of confusing messages, I checked FAQ, there were over 220 but none was answering my question. One said that the CD provided is outdated and I should download the latest edition. I did but still no results. I sent a e-mail to techsupport, no answer. Finally I found from somewhere(because there is no tech suport number for USA in the manual)their number and called. A short fused techguy guided me through the maze of various procedures and finnally after 58 minutes of long distance call on my expense,he got to the amazing conclusion that the camera is bad, return and get a new one.Return? Yes, a new one, No way! Stay away from electronics made in China. This is my third device, from different manufacturers, all Made in China, all bad out of the box!"
1,"TAKES INFERIOR QUALITY BLURRY PICTURES, WITH A LOT OF STRAY PIXELS","This is the worse web camera I have ever used in my entire life. The pictures are not clear at all even if you try to take pics with sunlight, it takes smudged stain-like pictures. It is too expensive for something crappy. I returned this logitech camera because I felt ripped off. Stay away from this product."
2,Not as Expected for Windows or Macintosh,"As my first webcam purchase, I thought the Logitech would be a good choice. The camera itself seems decent enough, but my problems were all with the software. I downloaded the newest software for the camera from the website and installed it on an XP machine. After installing the HUGE download, the machine would periodically crash and restart itself. Not good. I also tried to use the camera on a Macintosh powerbook with the macam driver (which is supposed to work) only to find that the camera would rarely adjust from a compeletly washed out appearance when using it with Skype."
3,Great at night.. but blown out in the daylight...,"This cam is great really. The built in mic is awesome. It perfroms well in medium to dark light. It is flexible. The privacy shade is helpful. It's easy to set up.. All around, it's great!My ONLY (and I do mean only) problem I have is that it perfoms poorly durring the daylight. Even with my blinds pulled down, daylight is simply too much for this little baby to handle. The light get's blown out and all the rest makes you look like you haven't slept or eaten in days. I gave it three stars, because no matter how awesome it perfoms, it's only really useful at night. Dang."
3,Great for the price!,Had a bit of trouble with the color and making it usable with other computers but for the price works great and the picture is almost clear.
5,Great Webcam,This is the first web cam I've ever purchased but it has served it's purpose very well. We use it to communicate with my mother-in-law in another state so she can see our children and it's absolutely terrific! We've had no problems with it. It was very easy to install. The mic is built in and works just fine. I would definetly recommend this webcam to anyone who is thinking of purchasing one!
1,Terrible Tech Support; Bad Software,"Upon installing the software, a ""Runtime Error"" occurred with XP that will not allow the QuickCam 10.0 software to run. When I called ""Tech Support,"" I kept getting an out-sourced answering machine. Neither would they reply by email. I would Strongly urge anyone Against purchasing from Logitech until they get their act together."
5,A good little buy.,"I ended up buying this webcam because it was reasonably priced and had a built in microphone. For once, the set-up was straight forward. Put the CD in and press next a few times and it worked.The picture is good and it does try to adjust the image based upon the background light levels. I have only used it with Skype and it works well. The built in microphone means no more headphones/USB phone which is convenient.I'm not 'techie' enough to comment on the review below which says about the amount of temporary files created when installing this webcam. I can say, however, that I have not noticed any effect on the performance of the computer after installation."
3,not so easy,"great picture, good sound..... but never the 2 at the same time. friend and i purchased 2 of these at same time. we can either see each other and hear nothing or hear one or the other while we see nothing. had high hopes but this has so far been a let down."
2,"quickcam , not so quick","i got this cam a few weeks ago, and for the most part its been horrible. the software that came with it was way out of date. but even the new online updated software has many problems with windows xp. its at the point now this cam is going on ebay and ill go get a new one from another maker. logitech does not have a fix for the problems i had,only ""work arounds"", so be careful. picture quality is so so,i had problems with the built in mic. out of 5 starts is give it 2. before you buy this go onto the logitech web page and read about all the problems."
2,"Great colour, terrible frame rate!","The colour is really good but the frame rate is appalling. Feed this through something like Skype and you have a colourful mess. The ""Follow Me"" feature is a useless gimmic that doesn't really work. The installation and software are indeed userfriendly but it's the hardware's performance that really matters.Logitech ... how about answering this review and telling us all how to make the framerate work properly. I certainly would not recommend Logitech products after my experience of this camera. One other thing: yes, it is good with low light but I cannot get it to adjust to daylight!! Not much good for web-cam work out the window! Still, maybe I'm doing something wrong, something some nice person in Logitech could correct!"
4,Best Webcam in the market,"I bought this before I went on a month long trip to India so that I could see my family. It did a terrific job - amazing quality. It is packed with features such as screen saver on demand, integrated microphone, follow-me feature etc. Sadly another Logitech webcam - not STX - I carried was lousy and my family couldn't see anything at all....The only negative side to this is the inconvenient design that you can't keep this on the monitor to stay steady. So I taped this camera on one of my speakers and move the speaker around to center the subject- pretty lousy workaround."
5,Great camera for the price,Very good product. I did not have any problems installing the product. I have used it for several months without any problems. Image resolution is good compare to all the cameras I have had in the past.
4,Serves the Purpose very efficiently,The Logitech QuickCam Communicate STX camera adequately serves my need for Video Chat.The Quick Capture mode with good microphone makes this a very good buy. I am very satisfied with the Web Cam and Amazon service
3,Good video quality - bad design,"I bought the Logitech stx webcam after reading the reviews on amazon and some other websites. Even after placing the order, I was really not sure if it would be a good choice for me because I have a laptop and some of the reviews mentioned problems with the clip for flat screen/notebook displays. I ordered it anyway and when I got it I realized the reviews were right. The clip would not sit tight on the monitor it would just be hanging on the top and there is no way u can move the cam up or down -- the cam comes off the stand if you try to move it either way - this proved to be very annoying. The quality of the cam however was very good even in low light conditions. If not for the clamp, I would have kept the cam."
4,cool webcam,This thing works great especially with msn messenger..sometimes it's slow using yahoo messenger but it's better than most cams. I haven't had one problem yet and it comes with a great stand that makes it very easy to adjust to where you want to view it
4,Good Camera bad microphone,"I really like the camera, but the microphone is horrible. There is a lot of echo when I use this microphone. It would be helpful if there is a way to shut the microphone... Any suggestions?"
2,Cheap price for a cheap product,"I bought this camera to use with my Windows laptop computer so that I could video chat with my family while traveling. While it can work for this, everything about the camera is so poorly exectued that its very frustrating to use. Software/driver installation was and continues to be problematic. The mounting system is awful, the camera is rather large, and the microphone does not work half of the time. And when it does work the image and sound quality are poor.I guess I am spoiled by the iSight camera on my Mac, but then the iSight was much more expensive than the QuickCam. Given the low price for this item (I paid about $25 on sale) its OK and will sometimes do the job, but if you are expecting a good quality product, you'll have to pay more."
4,Works well but doesn't stay on laptop,"This camera is great! Very easy to install and use. The picture quality is outstanding. The only downside is that it doesn't stay on my latop very well (I have a Dell Latitude). I think this would not be a problem if I had a laptop with a flatter screen edge. Nonetheless, I just prop it on some books and it is just fine."
4,Great cam for the price,I bought two of these cams so I can talk to my girlfriend over the internet. They installed easily and worked great. We are 100 miles apart and were able to have real-time audio and video while playing an online game. We used MSN Messenger. I feel Yahoo doesn't do video well regardless of what camera you have. I would avoid Yahoo for video. It also turned out to be a great toy for an 8-year-old who wants to make her own movies.
4,Awesome!,"I Bought this Cam to talk to a friend of mine who was sent over to Iraq with the army and it hasn't disappointed me yet! The picture quality is awesome, once and a while it will be delayed but normally that is due to the internet speed on the other computer. Its really easy to use, the only thing I haven't figured out yet is how to get the mic to work."
4,Good Cam.,"I was very pleased with this webcam. It got the job done and doesn't lag all that much. It also has this neat little blue light to tell you when it's on, I love it. XD"
5,Very good Stuff,"Don't really use most of the fancy software that comes with it, but it's simple and you can put it both on the desk and the TFT monitor..."
2,Good video. Horrible audio!,"I bought the webcam based on positive reviews. The high resolution video is quite good, it operates good in low light (with the low light filter and color boost on).the audio (mic) however is another story altogether. after 10-20 seconds, the receiver (remote end) gets a shrill audio disturbance, more like a static noise/white noise similar to the one heard with the television tuned to an empty channel. this happens in every software, yahoo messenger, msn, google talk and even skype.after searching logitech forums, a LOT of people have hit this issue with this camera. and it seems to manifest itself with laptops for some reason. logitech does not yet have any answer for this, so if you are considering using this with a laptop, I would definitely NOT recommend this camera, even though I had high hopes for this combo of mic + video for under $40. my search still continues...."
5,Perfect camera...,"This camera has perfect picture quality. The picture is really sharp. And it gives nice view even in low light. The only time that it doesnt work is under sunshine, in this case you will see a completely white screen. the sound quality is very good. I had the chance to compare it with several other cameras that my friends had bought, which were also at the range of $40-50. They were much worse than this in terms of picture quality and sound. And some of them toke back theirs to the seller and bought one of these...And for this moment me and my roommates all have the same camera..."
4,Excellent webcam,"If you need a good webcam for your notebook ,don't think twice ,this is what you need.If you have a Toshiba Satellite series don't worry this webcam works PERFECT , easy to install , good picture , good video recording ,etc etc....JUST BUY IT !"
2,"Picture - OK, Video - shaky, Audio - TERRIBLE","This is my first webcam. I had no idea echoing would be a problem but it is a MAJOR problem with this camera. I've had it for three days and I hate the audio so much I want to return it or exchange it for a better one. If you can afford a better camera, get one!"
1,Very unhappy!,"Bought four of these cameras(2 from another vendor) for wife and kids to use. so far have not been able have total success with any of them. Most of our PC's crashed or slowed to a crawl when the software was loaded. We may get video and no audio,or vice-versa. Downloading software directly from Logitech helped our PC but two kids have given up and removed the software due to slow system.Have tried different IM services but no luck so far."
5,"Easy install, works great","I installed on a Windows XP machine, and it went very smoothly. It was immediately recognized by Skype and other webcam-supporting software. Image is bright and detailed, and the microphone/audio is loud and clear. Worthy every penny."
4,Wrong Picture Shown!!!,"Note to buyers...the picture shown here on Amazon is actually the SFX model, NOT the STX model (which I believe is a discontinued model). Logitech shows the same error, which was a huge surprise. Trust me on this...I received the box and it's definitely NOT the same cam as the picture."
2,Backwash Noise,"I have to agree with the other reviews. The picture was great and clear. Still image picture-taking was a bonus. However, despite reloading the software 3 times, I still couldn't get the sound to work properly on MSN messenger. There would be times that the person on the other end had so much backwash noise - similar to being in a wind tunnel or something. I never heard it on our end. We tried everything to clear it up and nothing worked (even with Logitech's help). I will be returning it tomorrow."
4,Nice cam,"I like this camera. It worked pretty well out of the box. And for the price, you can't beat it. I previously had I think the first Logitech Quickcam back 7 or so years ago. Liked the product/service then and like it now."
4,camera/mic good base stinks,"the camera and mic work well, even with our cable connection the picture is jumpy though. the base doen't work well for us."
4,Good for the price!,sharp imagine. auto light adjustment. can make good still photos. easy to use. work well with yahoo messenger. Suggestion: don't move quick when taking video. Good for the price
5,Great little device give much pleasure,Friends and family were amazed when I sent them a video email. I was blown away when I had an on line video call with my daughter. It is wonderful.
3,Pretty Good but One Drawback,"I have no experience of using webcams, but this one worked well. The only thing that didn't work was when I signed up for Logitech's free 30-day trial for its own communication system, and its program refused to recognize the existence of the Logitech camera (though AIM and Windows Messenger did) however much I experimented with settings - so that part of what was on offer was useless, but otherwise I am very satisfied."
3,Logitech QuickCam Communicate STX,That's alright. It's easy to use and install. But the automatic brightness adjust funtion isn't as good as it describle on the box.
3,OK camera for the money,"This camera is OK, but the zoom get real grainy. The sound is good and installs easily."
4,Awesome for this price range,"The webcam, costing just over $20, is really good. The video and picture quality is fantastic. A little deterioration while on the messanger is well within acceptable limits. If you are looking for a good and non-expensive webcam, go for this one."
1,Problem with MSN messenger,This webcam generate high pitch noise constantly under MSNmessenger. It is reported in the Logitech tech support forum butno solution found yet. This is the first Logitech product failed on me.
3,you get what you pay for,"i wanted the cheapest camera out there and I got it. The video is fine, just a little slow sometimes. Has only locked up a couple of times. The audio isn't worth anything. I use it to communicate with family in another state and we usually just use the speaker on our cell phones. The speaker on the camera is very hard to communicate with. It goes silent if you ever talk over each other, which happens a lot with my 3 year old niece. Half of every sentence is missed so we just mute the mic and use the camera only. The camera has been just what we needed. Just enough to actually see each other. I think that it is definitely worth the 40 bucks we paid for the camera to see family more regularly."
3,A good guide for the beginner,"This book is a great introduction to the world of vintage clothing. It includes the basics of collecting clothing from 1850 through the 1970's. The information is nicely organized and is easy to find. Advanced collectors, however, probably will not find any new information in this small book."
3,not bad for the price,"Book has nice glossary of vintage fabrics and desriptions. Covers a wide range of designers and there history. The book is on the right track ,but it's only 120 pages and could use a bit more info."
4,Instant Expert!,"As the backcover states, Instant Expert:Everything you need to know- it is all here in a quick little reference guide. If you want summarized information that is concise and easy to read, this is the book. A great little resource for the novice who just wants a little help with the basics."
5,Nice ring at a good price,This is a very nice-looking ring at a good price. Alexandrite is pretty expensive.
4,Questionable packaging?,"This mill is fantastic, as it should be. I was dismayed however to see that the head had received a knock hard enough to chip the lacquer finish. It was packaged only in a bag that had then been placed in a same sized Amazon box with puffpak. Vic Firth not ensuring damage protection loses a star. We still put some peppercorns in to try it and it is a world class mill, grinding either chunk or dust effortlessly. The finish is uniformly smooth, like wet nail polish, and the height makes it a real eye catcher."
2,"Decent looking, not long lasting","I purchased this set almost three years ago. While a decent looking set, the pepper mill did not hold up to moderate use. The grinding mechanism became increasingly stiff over time, then the metal grinding mechanism, which was screwed into the acrylic body, completely broke away from the mill. It was not just a matter of the screws popping out; pieces of the acrylic body broke away with the metal grinder. I could try gluing the broken acrylic pieces back together and re-affixing the grinder, but if the breakage resulted from too much pressure from the grinding mechanism then I suspect the repair will not hold up, either."
1,Very Poor,The grinding mechanism on the pepper mill is very poor and only results in a very fine powder with a lot of effort. There is no real adjustment (that works). I Should have returned it!
3,Sarah Silverman Program,"Seasons 1 and 2 are pretty good, but season 3 went of the deep end. Sarah's character is probably one of the least likable ever in a sitcom ... could anyone ever be more self-centered than this? I like how almost all the episodes span the course of 1 day, even though the sequence of the events would obviously take more than 1 day. Look for one of Zach Galifianakis's earliest roles as the homeless guy in season 1, as well as other guest appearances in many episodes."
1,She is not funny...,She is as humorous as your humorous....I really mean what I say. I have tried to like her style of comedy but it is just sad and pathetic.
3,"Once it's together, it's not bad","The product is nice and serves the purpose that I bought it for, but be warned the instructions are sparse and not totally accurate. It also takes three hands to assemble. Imagine my shock to find out the spacing on the shelves was wrong after I had it assembled. I checked and rechecked. I even had my wife read the instructions and tell me how far apart they said the support rods needed to be just to find out the count was off by one. Not a big deal if you don't need all the rows, unfortunately I needed them otherwise I would not have started over from the beginning.Now that all the complaining is out of the way and the rack is put together, it seems like a sturdy rack, it holds lots of DVDs and it looks nice. Although what you get for the price seems high, other less sturdy racks cost nearly as much so what else can you do? I guess the final measure is would I do it again if I needed too, probably that's why I gave it 3 stars."
5,NICE RACK!!!,"THE RACK IS GOOD, AND HOLD LOTS OF DVD'S/CD'S. BUT IT WAS A LITTLE CONFUSING TO ASSEMBLE.DON.."
1,Waste of money,This thing is a piece of junk. I put it all together and it's wobbly and if you lift it from the top it will fall apart. Filling the entire thing with DVDs is a real chore. You have to balance them perfectly or they will fall off. If someone accidently bumps into this you're pretty much going to have to redo everything. This thing is way overpriced. The only positive thing is that it looks OK. Whenenver I try to put back a DVD or two I always seem to have about 3 other DVDs fall off into the back of the unit (it's against the wall).
4,best storage for this price,"I was looking for CD/DVD storage for long time.I have close to 200 CD/DVDs and didn't want bulk furniture item to stay in my living room.I came across with this one and before I bought it I was reading reviews for it on a different websites.And here is my review.This storage system doesn't take a lot of space and it is easy to assemble.I have my rack filled up almost up to the full capacity and it's very stable.But if you don't have enough CDs or DVDs to put on this rack they will not stay on it. If you touch one, the other disks will probably fall down behind the rack (if you don't catch them fast enough). To prevent disks falling off the rack you have to use plastic dividers. Dividers come in the package but not enough (about one per row).But if you don't have enough disks to put on this rack look for the smaller one."
5,Living the Florida Life,"Nice variety of articles pertaining to the entire state. Articles vary each issue. Only problem is that it is not published each month of the year. Still, a good bargain for the money."
1,Florida magazine review,Unfortunately for me I am not enjoying this magazine...it doesn't have the information that I was expecting...however the subscription process via Amazon.com was very easy.Florida Travel and Life (1-year auto-renewal)
2,florida,"So far I like the magazine but I didn't receive the Se ptember issue, I received the aug and October"
2,More foolish make believe,"Well if these guys are to be believed, when you're attacked in a real fight, by more than one attacker, each of your attackers will hang on until you've dealt with his comrade, and each of these attackers will never use more than one attack and never end up on the ground. The physical ability of the instructors is beyond doubt, I just wish they wouldn't try to make people believe karate bunkia works in the real world. I feel this series is vastly over priced."
1,DO NOT BUY~~~,"I have used over 400 of these labels. I never could figure out WHY all my CD's would make horrible scratching noises after about 20 minutes of playing. Well I have finally found the answer. After the heat of the CD player begins to get hotter, the GLUE on the CD label begins to shift, and rise. This causes the small tolerance of the Cd Player to cause the Cd Player to malfunction. I discovered this because a friend just bought a new cd player and told me the cd I made him started scratching and causing the CD player to shut down. Interesting because this was the same as mine. When it happened to me again, I replaced the Fellowes label cd with a Non labeled CD and suddenly just seconds after I couldn't stand the Scratching noise of the Fellowes Labeled CD the Identical Non Label played for hours without a SINGEL PROBLEM... DO NOT BUY.... 3years and 400+ labels later, fellowes still hasn't improved their product."
4,Favorite and most economical,"Never had a problem with them, tried TDK & Avery and did not like as much as these. Neto is a great product supported by nearly all programs. Recomended."

5,"Fellowes Neato Matte 300-Count is ""Neat-O""","I was burning up alot of time and gas buying the 100-count of Fellowes Neato Matte CD/DVD Labels when I learned about the 300-count package size. What a big savings on the 300-count, I saved 40% and no more running around. The only thing better is the 500-count."
2,Nature sounds?,Unfortunately I was not very pleased with the alarm clock. The ocean sounds more like static than a real ocean. Also the alarm clock does not look as cute as I imagined it would (based on the picture). The face of the clock actually looked as if the alarm clock had been used before because it had a few scratches. On the upside...it works.
1,"Well, it wakes us up.","Regardless of the tone you have it on, ocean waves, bird noises, or regular beeping, the volume will yank you out of sleep to the point of hurting your back (literally). There's no way to adjust the volume. The beeping is like a garbage truck backing up in your bedroom. The ocean waves are like AM radio static, and the bird sounds have to be something from Jurassic Park. The only positive thing is that the snooze button is big and on the top; it's easy to bang in order to turn the gut-wrenching sound off. I'm logged on today to find a plain alarm clock. I'm moving this one into the den to use merely as a clock with no intention of ever letting it make another sound."
5,this one is the best,not many words can describe the simplicity yet uniqueness that this clock radio offers. the features are great. nothing more needs to be said about this awesome time piece.
4,Telling it like it is...,I am a Hurricane Katrina survivor and Eric Dunbar's Katrina: In the Aftermath of a Killer really tells it like it is. Eric tells the account from the eyes of someone other than the news media. I highly recommend that you read it.
2,Could not get WinXP to recognize the drive,"I bought this from another vendor for $30 less than amazon, but would probably have been better off not buying anything at all. I could not get WinXP to recognize the drive on an IBM T41 laptop. This laptop has a USB 1.0 connection, but it should still work, just slowly.It works perfectly on my Win2K desktop, but the purpose of buying this was to allow me to back up my laptop... I haven't been able to get in touch with customer support, so I'm not really a very satisfied customer."
4,#7 in this enjoyable YA historical mystery series,"When part of a loan to the Queen is stolen, Grace thinks a courtier is responsible and sets herself to unmask him. But when one candidate turns out to be innocent, she reluctantly must suspect a gentleman she admires.Interesting juxtaposition of Grace's detecting with the wedding celebration of one of the Queen's former Maids of Honor. As always in this YA series, whodunnit is fairly obvious, but Grace is a likable enough character to carry it off and the title is definitely relevant to the story. And the publisher finally put an Elizabethan girl on the cover instead of the 1950's schoolgirl of earlier books!"
4,Great sleeping bag for the price,"I bought this bag for a week long camping and canoeing trip to Canada. The bag is very light and compact. Temperatures at night were in the low 40's (Farenheit), and the bag was a bit too warm for temperatures that high. Plenty of foot room, although the bag is a little tighter in the chest area than it should be. However, you cannot beat the features on this sleeping bag for the price."
4,sleeping ligero en peso y a un precio muy bueno (calidad muy buen por el precio pagado),"Este sleeping esta a un precio increible ya que posee muy buena calidad.Es un sleeping ligero que ocupa poco espacio en la mochila. Acampa a 4200 msnm con una temperatura de 0 grados C a las 6 am experimente un poco de frio en los pies pero en la zona del pecho y brazos mantiene confortable el clor corpporal.Recomiendo en temperaturas menores a 0 grados acompanar con mono de fibra polar, medias de fibra polar para aumentar la capacidad de retener calor corporal; creo que la zona de confort esta alrededor de 0 grados centigrados con temperaturas menores a 0 grados C se debe usar una ropa termica o tela termica que retenga el calor, los cierres o cremalleras funcionan muy bien.Excelente sleeping para temperaturas entre -1 a 15 grados centigrados."
2,Too large for bike camping or backpacking,"This is a pretty good bag to sleep in, and is very well constructed. The exterior material seems very robust, but is not the most comfortable. The 15-degree rating isn't right at all; on a trip down the cool and foggy Oregon Coast, I began to feel uncomfortably chilly at around 30 degrees.However, the bag's main problem is that it doesn't pack down well -- a problem not helped by the mediocre compression sack that is included. This bag is simply too large for use on a backpacking trip or bike tour, and the space it takes up is space better used for food or water. A far better solution for any summer or fall camping would be to find a cheap down bag (30 degree down bags don't cost much more than this one) and a bulkier sleeping pad."
2,"Too small for me, zipper is weak","I used this bag once and I doubt I will use it again. It was way too small for me, particularly around the shoulders. I am 6'1"" and 214 lbs. but not broad-shouldered at all. I got the regular size which actually is long enough for me, but, I felt mummified the whole night. I was warm enough but it was a summer trip so I'm not sure if that qualifies as a test. The zipper was also a problem getting caught in the material. Its easy to do. I'm not sure if a mummy bag is for me but I definitely need more space. It would probably be quite good for a kid or someone smaller."
5,sleeping bag review,"The Eureka Casper sleeping bag is excellent. It is warm, light weight and compact. It is a great bag for camping or backpacking. The included compression sack allows it to fit into an internal frame backpack. It is large enough for an adult to fit into but small and light enough for a youth to easily carry. It satisfies the temperature rating and makes staying warm enough possible. To receive these qualities at the affordable price was amazing."
4,Not too bad..,"I am a thru-hiker, used this for weeks/months on end.+ Temp+ Weight- Too silky :)- Hard to get used to the snugness.+ Can unzip a bit and let the arms out+ zipper never unzipped in the middle of the night- 2 way zipper starts at knees (read: no feet vent)+ has its own compression bag to carry- the pillow easily easily falls out of the pocket for it"
5,Excellent Bag,"This is an amazing product and it is an absolute steal for the price it's being offered at. I slept outside in 35 degree weather and was completely warm and have yet to take it down closer to 15, but my guess is that it would do just fine. Packs down to a nice, small, compact size that would fit perfectly in most any UL backpack and the stuff sack has a great compression system. The only draw back would be that if you're a big guy, tall or round, it might be a little tight around the knees/chest. This doesn't affect me at all however and I can't believe I got such a great bag at such a low price. Definitely recommend."
4,Good mystery,"I enjoyed reading this book. Stayed up to 3 am to finish it, LOL. A classic mystery with no obvious red herrings giving it away too soon. Enough twists and turns to keep you reading and thinking you might know who ""done it"", won't say more but its a good book, quite well written, well done."
2,very slow moving,"This book was about a hundred pages to long. Information was restated and really did not matter. Could have been much better. If a business owner was really close to losing their business, they would not be off chasing clues about someone they never met. I guess I missed what previous reviewers found captivating."
3,"Murder, Arson, and a steady stream of suspects!","A good mystery that starts with a fire in a local art store in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. A dead body and trouble with identification gets the main character Alix Thorssen involved more than she ever wanted. Disrupting her romantic desires and her art business, she soon has a bizarre tale reminiscent of Alfred Hitchcock plaguing her. Mild action, mild bad language, mild sex, mild gore, and mostly mystery for the reader to guess about are the tone of the novel."
3,Good,Great plot twists and character development! In fact the character development was so good that you felt that you knew the main character extremely well. I didn't Like her at all. She was reckless and disrespectful toward others' lives. She always put other people's lives in jeopardy for no reason other than to satisfy her own curiousity about what was happening. Her personality was at odds with her hero role.
3,LACKS THE HUMOR OF PREVIOUS WORKS,I HAVE READ SEVERAL OF THE MAGOODY SERIES NOW AND I WAS NOT CRAZY ABOUT THIS ONE. THE OTHERS WERE FUNNY AND LIGHTHEARTED WHILE THIS ONE WAS TOO SERIOUS. HOWEVER I'LL KEEP ON READING MORE OF THE SERIES.
1,DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!!!!!,"THIS IS THE MOST RIDICULOUS INSTRUCTION BOOK EVER!looking at the blurb,you would think the book is full of demos on coloring flowers,but it is untrue!it has only a mere 3 demos and is a pathetically short book.don't waste your money on it!!!!!"
1,hopeless,I was extremely disappointed with this book. I do not know enough negative words to describe it!!!
2,Disappointing reference to the Duke,"This is my first acquaintance with the Count Basie Band conducted by Grover Mitchell and it is a disappointing one. In the booklet Grover Mitchell states that his favourite arrangers amongst others are Thad Jones, Frank Foster and Ernie Wilkins. I therefore can't understand why he chose Allyn Ferguson to write the charts for this selection of 13 Ellington standards. To me this album sounds like Sunday afternoon teatime dance music. I wish Frank Foster or Frank Wess would have contributed the arrangements in order to bring more drive and vitality to the music."
3,"no miracles, but works","don't expect to lose your appetite the moment you put the patch on. Give it a couple of days to work. Again, no miracles, but I did notice some ""craving curbing""."
2,double it,"Not sure how effective this really is, but seems like if you want to have that ""nauseous"" feeling some other reviewers talked about, then use 2. I had no problem with it falling off - even after exercise and showering. It probably works on a psychological level if you believe it will. It's worth a try to find out for yourself since it's sold at a much cheaper rate on Amazon...I probably won't reorder them, but will use them until they run out...2 at a time!"
1,"""Stick to the basics"" and pass this patch up!","Product absolutely did not work. Patch would not stick to skin -- anywhere -- for more than a couple hours, then it would just sort of sit there, limp. Manufacturer gave me an extra package of the patches. Gee, thanks.Don't bother."
1,Curb your cravings - pink patch,"I tried the Pink Patch and did not notice any changes. As per the instructions, I called and e-mailed within the specified amount of time to cancel my membership. Not only could I not get through to customer service for 2 days, but they did not return either phone calls or respond to my e-mails. They sent the next month's patch and charged my credit card. When I finally was able to talk to someone in customer service, he was rude. Now, I have to return the mailing and they say they will refund the purchase price but I have to pay all shipping charges. I would not trust this company and highly recommend that someone not order any products from them."
2,"I couldn't feel losing weight. This item was very weak, When I exercised, so my body wet, this item was gone!!","Curb Your Cravings Plus Weight Loss PatchI couldn't feel losing weight. This item was very weak, When I exercised, so my body wet, this item was gone!!"
5,Mom of junior Organ Scholar,My kid has had an interest in pipe organs since before there were any permanent teeth. This magazine is very informative and he thoroughly enjoys reading it.
5,A desert island fav!,Well what can you say about this lad from Scotland. He keeps getting better with age. Growing up with Aztec Camera I knew Roddy would save his best work for later and its right here. This is a great CD even for the first time listeners. Every song on Northstar is a gem and Roddy is such a master with his lyrics. He truly knows how to write songs and cheer ya up. Go buy this disc! 5-stars for The North Star.
2,Need a door anchor for most exercises,"The picture on the cover of this book is SOOO misleading. There is not a single door anchor in sight on the cover. I expected there to be SOME anchored exercises, sure. However, easily 90% of the book is filled with anchored exercises. The remaining moves are a mix of stretches, abdominal work, and non-anchored band work. This does not work for me... I don't have any area in my tiny, old house where I can easily (or safely) anchor a resistance band. I opted to buy a book instead of browsing the internet because I wanted good descriptions and something portable. This book fits those requirements, but the exercises within are very limiting.Sorry, but this is going back to Amazon."
1,Many Poor Attributes,"I spent a lot of time looking for a multi-function color printer and was disappointed when I could not find a clear front-runner, even though we were prepared to spend up to $1,000. The Xerox 6110 mfp/x seemed to have all of the features we needed so we bought one. It has done nothing but disappoint. It is slooooooowww. If you want to copy, fax or scan, you need to tell the machine twice. Once to get it warmed up for that task and again after it is warmed up. The toner cartridges keep popping out of place and are very expensive to replace. I would not buy this printer."
4,Surprised!,"I was impressed by this CD, not being especially familiar with the band, especially in their latter incarnations. Lots of ""angular"" sounds that defy convention. I've found that this sort of stuff has more longevity than pap that initially sounds just groovy, man. Captain Beefheart as another example of this effect, and he has an impact on me that has lasted my entire life, so far."
4,Good enough!,This is a two CD set and the first CD is a very early sound from Elvis. The second CD is a real good treat!
4,Knowing Jesus,"Fawn Parish does an great job of reminding all followers of Jesus that we need to make a concerted effort each day to draw close, to learn, to pray, to reflect and to make real the incarnation in our individual lives.Using a mixture of quotes [for me a little overdone], antidotes and scriptural references we are challenged afreash to commit time, energy and passion to our relationship with Jesus and all that that can and should entail.An easy read, either as a devotional or at one sitting. Ms. Parish brings insight and conviction to familiar material for anyone who has called on Yeshua [Jesus] in their desire to draw close to God."
4,great scissors,"Recommended by a jeweler craftswoman...really nice in the hand, sliced thru my non-ferrous metals like butter. Hope they keep their sharp edge, cuz I want to use them for a long time. My jeweler's shears don't do as well, harder to use. Score!"
3,rusts but still nice,"for a light weight of a kitchen scissors, it's not that bad at cutting chicken bones. it doesn't cut through clean, but it still does the job without you having to strain too much. it does rust easily in the dishwasher, all i do is handwash it. for the price it's not that bad of a buy."
4,Excellent but....,These are excellent scissors but are far too small. We use them for cutting raw meat and meat with bones (chicken or turkey). They work great for that but are so small that it makes it difficult and makes more work for the cutter. Wish these were 11 inches long and that they also came apart so you can thoroughly clean them.
2,Very small for a pair of kitchen scissors!,"The description claims that these scissors are good for use in the kitchen but I think that needs some clarification. The cutting edge of the blades is only about an inch and a half long! The ""Torque engineering"" that is referred to can surely only mean that the handles are longer than the blades and so providing a gain due to leverage - other than that there is nothing really different compared to 'regular' scissors. When the description refers to chicken bones does it really mean just chicken ribs and cartlidge? The pivot is a simple rivet - pretty basic (and cheap) for a relatively expensive pair of scissors. Such a simple rivet also means that you can't take the blades apart. The scissors do work OK as regular scissors i.e. for cutting paper, plastic packaging etc. but no more so than any other reasonably well made, and possibly less expensive, design."
5,Fantastic Scissors,"I first purchased these scissors several years ago. I find them to be so handy for so many things that I now keep a pair in almost every room of the house -- very convenient whenever I need them. About the only tasks I don't use them for are when I need to cut long lengths of fabric or long pieces of gift wrap paper, because those tasks require scissors with long blades -- but for everything else, they're absolutely wonderful - and comfortable. Last Christmas I decided to give these scissors as gifts to many of the people on my list, and everyone who received them tells me that, like me, they also use them every day for just about everything. Probably the most appreciated little gifts I've ever given. Buy them - you won't be sorry. Well worth the money and a great value. RFS"
2,TKO Black Ankle Wieghts (5 lb.),"These worked great for about 3 weeks, until the fabric right next to the sewn-in Velcro began to rip and leak the inner pebbles on both weights. Unacceptable quality, they should have at least lasted me 6 months.If you're looking for something to add a little more heft to your routine, skip these and spend a bit more money on a product that will actually keep up with your workout."
2,Busted Already,"Bought these a couple months ago and they're busted already. Very disappointed since they were used solely for PT (walking, stairs, etc.), NO PLAY. Got home two days ago and my child's shoe was filled with black sand (sigh)."
2,TKO Black Ankle Weights (5 lbs),When I first received the weights they were comfortable and seemed like a great purchase. After a few uses the shape of the weights broke down and the Velcro began to tear away from the weight. By the fourth use the Velcro had scratched open a bit of the weight and granules from the weight would fall out consistently. They are now unusable! These weights were very poorly made.TKO Neoprene Wrist/Ankle Weights
5,Go no further,Quick on; quick off. Adds just the right extra umph to my leg specific exercise DVD. Side note - don't get the kind that have 'bean bags' that you either add or subtract to vary the weight; major pain in the rear and have a very lopsided feel to them.
3,"A well-done, if modest, look at an interesting subject","Very short narrative, including the date and place of birth and death, accompanies a good color photograph of each grave. Arranged chronologically by the year of death, this resource includes figures from the world of politics, entertainment, science, literature, sports and the military."
5,Buy lots of these!,These little flashlights are the best things! I keep one on an outside zipper of every handbag and carry-on bag I own and on my keychain so I'm never without it. They've come in handy when the power has gone off or when darkness has fallen and during plane rides when I've dropped things under my seat. I think they're so handy that I give them as gifts to people I care about to light their way in a pinch and keep them safe.
1,Buggy software and support is non exsistant,"Do not buy any Nuance products, period. They have taken a great product (orginal Paperport up to 8.0) and totally screwed it up. My PaperPort 10.0 was purchased at a retail store a I have all the activation numbers. It will load to my PC but will not open giving error messages. For the final insult to a customer is that Nuance CHARGES FOR ANY HELP OR SUPPORT. THEIR DAMN SOFTWARE WILL NOT WORK AND THEY WILL NOT FIX IT!!!In their knowledge base the problem I am experianceing says ""some mPC communications will cause PP 10.0 to not load. Remove the ofending software and try again. DO NOT BUY ANY OF THE NUANCE PRODUCTS!!!!"
4,Didn't need to update like I thought,"I haven't had any technical problems, but I don't see much improvement from verison 8. The big feature is making pdf files, but since I have Adobe 5 I can already make pdf files easily. It does make it directly from the scan though. The MAX format was good because you could add text and edit. There are conversion programs now that will convert pdf files to editable word files. I think I would have been more prudent to consider that program as it would have been more useful. The Epson printer scan software works well enough. The program isn't bad, you just have to assess your needs first."
1,ScanSoft PaperPort 10 - Thumbs Down,"Many years ago, I switched from Papermaster to Paperport 7.0. The difference was so dramatic that I fell in love with Paperport right away. Since then I have upgraded as each new version was released. Paperport 9.0+ turned out to be the best that ScanSoft released. Version 10 has many problems including ease of use, missing features, instability when printing from an external document.My suggestion to those who have verson 9 is to keep it, and those contemplating purchasing Paperport for the first time, invest in version 9. It is still available many places on the web including Amazon.com"
1,No Zero Star Available? Ugh.,"The only thing worse than version 10 is version 11. On a computer with 3.0 gHz dual core, 2MB RAM, 1TB Storage, this program is EXCRUCIATINGLY SLOW when viewing any more than a handful of documents! I need SEVERAL HUNDRED per folder, and it is coming up FAR short.Horrible. Don't waste your money. In fact, going to the casino or bar would be money better spent."
2,Buggy,"I've been using Paper Port 9 for some time, with satisfaction. 10 is, on balance, a step back from 9 and I don't recommend it. The Page Autostraighten feature, so useful in 9, is unavailable in 10. It's always grayed out. Storage of native files could be put in an assigned folder in 9, but not in 10. And 10 operates slower. ScanSoft offers essentially zero customer support except at a charge, so no help there. I'm about to remove 10 and re-install 9."
1,Four months later -- still not patch,"I have used PaperPort since version 8. Version 10 should be much better. It has some nice ideas added. They just don't work in the first release.The other reviews of this product spotlight the defects in the initial release. It is usually a good idea to wait for the first patch before writing any review of a product. But it is not four months since ScanSoft allowed this mess out the door, and there is no sign of progress.Listen to what other people have said. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT UNTIL THEY MEND IT."
2,Buggy,"Does not work with XP Professional. I have tried reinstalling, thank you. Locks up about every fifth time when printing in the PaperPort proprietary format to file from Web. Then if you reboot and try to delete the file using the program, it locks up again. The only way to delete is to open a dos command line, go to the directory and delete there. You can print to file in PDF format and then convert to Paperport Format. Every new version of PaperPort comes out Buggy. I have been using the program since version 5. This one is the worst. They have no patches."
4,MEMORIES,I LOVE THIS SONG IT BRINGS BACK ALOT OF MEMORIES. I HAVE A SINGLE AND THE ALBUM. I THINK THAT LIL SUZY IS BEAUTIFUL
2,Not all that,"I bought this cd for 18 bucks and it wasnt realy worth it. Most of the songs that was good i already had. I thought that it would have more cuts n shiet but then this CD isnt really that goood. Only good songs are like The way I love you, and memories. The rest is all weird, i dont really like it, and plus her voice she sorta sounds like a dude....aint bein mean n or anythang i aint clownin lil suzy but hey some songs she sound like a dude"
1,You know what kind of movie this is!!,"Okay, true believer, you know what kind of movie this is. This is not for the ladies' acting talents. Maybe their natural talents. Plot:(whatever little there is) Girls need money, they do a calendar shoot (teaser for softcore montage), girls play strip poker with each other (softcore montage), girls do something with their clothes on, girls end up in Foxy Boxing(c)(tm) type of boxing match. Lots of jiggling and toplessness ensue throughout whole movie."
4,Great gift idea... at least I thought so...,"When we were getting married, I reminded my husband that it's customary to exchange gifts before the wedding. Unfortunately I had NO IDEA what to get him. I came across this keychain and loved it right away; I had it engraved with our initials and wedding date (he can't have an excuse for forgetting now!) and packaged it with a lovely frog prince. When he opened the gift he looked kind of shocked and asked, ""Do you want me to get a Prince Albert?"". We laugh about it still. :)"
2,confusing and contrived,"This is the worst DB design book that I've come across. The first few chapters is supposed to 'guide' you through the db design process, but the example is too lengthy and not to the point. The concepts that is to be explained is illustrated by contrived(using the author's own word) examples. Explanation is confusing. Luckily, I got this from a library and nothing to lose"
5,Excellent video for kids that like watching factory machines,"This video is great! It shows step by step of how a car is made from sheets of metal to a Ford mustang that rolls off the assembly line. Very easy to follow and recommended for ""kids"" between 4-104."
1,It won't play,"I don't know, maybe I don't have the right equipment to play this, but according to the Systems Requirements, it says I do. I downloaded everything, answered the survey, etc. When I tried to play it, the only thing it did was re-arrange my icons on my desktop. Who knows, it may be a good product, but I can't play it."
4,Another Quality Milwaukee Tool,I found this to be a quality nailer. Good range on depth adjustment. Easy to load and open slide allows you see clearly see remaining nail supply. I have not experienced any jams after shooting over 100 nail sleeves of various sizes. The tool is light weight and comfortable to hold. The ability to direct the air exhaust and the belt hook are nice features. I was surprised that the tool did not come with a male hose fitting. Overall a great value.
1,3 nail success,"Received the nailer for what I thought was a fair price. Attached coupler (not provided & hard to find 3/8"" MIP) and fired two nails in a piece of scrap to make certain gun was OK. Weeks later when I needed the nailer I got one nail in a piece of trim and the tool was inoperative. Customer service gave me a few ideas to try (none of which worked) and then told me to take to a factory authorized repair facility. That was over a week ago and have not heard from them. I gave it a One Star for the nice carrying case that it comes in."
5,Milwaukee quality,This is a sweet gun!!! Milwaukee makes the best tools for my money and no other tool maker gives a 5 year warranty. If they will stand behind a tool they make for 5 years knowing how guys like me are gonna treat it... Milwaukee has a loyal customer for life.
5,Just what I needed,"I bought this product mainly to frame a patio door. I am not good with a hammer so this was exactly what I needed. It worked perfect right out of the box. No hammer marks on the inside trim, my wife was very pleased. It propably saved me at least one hour time over useing a hammer. I can't find Milwaukee nais but others have said most other brands of angle nails will work fine. Looking forward to my next project. I would definately recommed this product."
3,Can't Toe-Nail!,"Everything is swell about this except the safety foot, which prents toe-nailing. My cheapo Harbor Freight gun has the safety built into the nose of the gun,allowing you to fire at an angle."
5,Bravo for Vic Firth One More TIme!,"Vic Firth-Mario 7 inch-Walnut-Salt MillAfter having purchasd, used with frustration, broken, recyled or returned many salt mills over the past three decades, I have finally reached Salt Nirvana!! Long have I known of Vic Firth's personal percussion artistry as well as his dedicated support and bottomless generosity to youth band programs in Massachusetts and throughout the U.S.A. I recently learned from two differenct sources in the music community and the gourmet cooks community of the worth of Firth in salt milling! WOW!!! We two cooks here certainly must agree! We have happily filled, used, adjusted and refilled our sleekly designed and so-well engineered VF Salt Mill for over a month now. WE LOVE THE SMOOTH ACTION!! One more time,Vic Firth is SO worth ""his salt!!"" BRAVO!!"
5,Great break 'n beats album with a sense of humor,"Mazzo is a famous Amsterdam based club and this album proves that they did their homework.. On this compilation CD you'll find 11 excellent tracks that you won't find anywhere else. With obscure bandnames like Bonobo, Tomba Vira, Prince Abooboo and the Boom-di-ites you can expect a lot of bongbongs... First track, Hammond Pops from Bonondo is a relaxed down-tempo classic based on the Hammond-organ that will set the tone for the rest of the album: starting easy, going faster and faster until you can't stop dancing... Great cd for DJ-s looking for a dance-gem."
3,Poor boys...,"Mr Rao tells the story of Yudi, a forty year old freelance journalist living in Bombay and his twenty year old boyfriend Milind. The novel offers nothing more original than the old tale of a middle-aged man falling in love with a boy half his age. Other authors have dealt with this topic in a more refined manner: Stefan Zweig in ""Confusion"" or Thomas Mann in ""Death In Venice"".What may make this novel worth reading are the sights and sounds of India which are described in a humorous way by the author."
3,"Functional, not elegant","This is your basic cover. I bought it because it would fit into a pocket book without bulging, but did not like the product. It expands but is not elastic, so it will not hold a slightly smaller camera snugly. And the ""magnetic"" click is very weak, hardly holds at all. I have seen other similar products out there that are better than this; I would keep looking."
1,Two single packs CHEAPER than One double?????,"I cannot believe they WILL NOT change the price. 2 single packs are cheaper than 1 double pack. I HAVE TOLD THEM several times that www.staples.com has it for $60.99 and www.officemax.com has it for $59.99 and with a $50.00 order-free shipping too.When they can meet or beat this price, I'll buy from them-amazon.com. If I run out before, I'll go elsewhere."
3,Simple math....,"UPDATE 27 SEPT 2011:It seems they just lower the price on this 2-pack deal. Now it makes sense!Too bad I've just ordered two 'single' cartridges from the other link.At the time I ordered the 'single' ones, the price for this 2 cartrdige pack, was way too high.If you're prdering now, check the price first, than decide which to order.*****************************5 AUGUST 2011:Why buy 1 of these, while you can buy 2 of theseEpson T032120 Black Inkjet Cartridge, for about half that much."
5,Inspiring! I'm getting this book for everyone I know!,"I'm a huge Joseph Cornell fan, and own every book that has anything to do with him. This is the best! Not only are the images beautiful and plentiful (and many new to me), but the stories and poems are so unbelievably entertaining and different from one another. I've never seen a book quite like this one, and I'm going to give a copy to everyone I know!"
4,better when it's shared,"When I first read this book (silently to myself), I thought it was okay. The very first time I shared it with a class (4th grade), the book came to life. What a powerful story of learning and living. A student reported to me today that she repeated ""KEMP-CHIN-SKI"" on the soccer field and her team scored soon after. Oh, the great, far-reaching power of a wonderful, affecting book."
2,not as described,This book did not really talk about breast cancer and how it impacts school children at all. Very disappointing.
5,Beautiful insight into Ocean Life,My college daughter had to read this book for an Environmental Studies course; she borrowed it from our local library and loved it so much I decided to order it from Amazon as a holiday gift for her. After returning it to the library she kept saying she wished she could just buy it from the library - so I was thrilled to find it on Amazon and she was just as thrilled and surprised to receive her own copy! The photos are amazing!
2,"Too little, too simple & out of order","I just found the book a little useless and the chapters way too short to really give you a footing on the subject. The thing about Photoshop is you really,really, need to grasp the concept and just a few pages can do more damage then good. Why a beginner would need to know how to export to Illustrator is beyond me. Color Casting is not even taught in most Photoshop courses. So rather then give a really good desrciption of the tool box and the pallets and show multiple examples of how and when they are used their off on areas that stray way to far from the basics.By page 107 the're are showing you how to build jpg. images for the WEB, but it takes months of other skill building before you can even begin to do that correctly.So there are points to be gotten from any Photoshop book but the list here never gets past 3. One of those is the fact it's in color. Save your money and get Elaine Weinmann & Peter Lourekas'Visual Quickstart guide for Photoshop"
5,A Fantastic Book,"In my reading of this book, I found it very interesting and very good reading. Mr. Ruckman does a very good job of describing his life. The book is a real encouragement and a blessing. It helps encourage those that go through trials or have gone through trials to keep on living for the Lord Jesus Christ. I would recommend it to anyone at any age."
4,Good Reggae/Rock,"Wobble is a charming and underrated artist who follows his own muse, into innovative places. Last year's ""Alpha One Three"" was especially strong, a dub/ethnic music festival that could have, should have been heard by more people. This record is simpler and straighter by comparison to that one, which disappointed me on first listen, but the songs soon gained traction in my head. The album is straighter by design, but it's a work of beauty."
3,2 exxcellent songs logging on to equip.org,song one called desolation and song 12 called lord keep me are masterpieces and the rest of the songs bookend them. does jah log on to equip.org?
4,Pretty good......read on.....,"I don't own this phone, my dad does.He seems to like it, but there are some minor flaws.The camera is great. We took this phone to Mexico last year, and the camera even worked on the plane.There is no video.Voicemail,phone book,internet,text message,and picture message all work flawlessly.The ringer volume is exceptional. When he has it charging upstairs and we are downstairs, we can hear it ring clearly.No speaker phone.The keypad numbers are really ugly, they look like 15th century English or something.The front display isn't color,which is a big oops for LG, because all camera phones should atleast have color front display.The battery life is good, it has 4 bars instead of the normal 3 bars most cells have.The antenna is cheap,flimsy,and worthless. It does inprove reception, but is very delicate.Reception is great when you have the antenna up.Overall, good phone for you, not for me.Last Word:Good for Dads."
5,Adorable,"This is SUPER cute, the tounge out and all. Looks just like my girl Rat Terrier as well. She sits on my desk and is precious, one of the best Rat Terrier looks Ive ever come across in any item, most dont look like a true Rat Terrier or the colors of mine anyway."
4,The forgotten ones on one cd!!!!!!!!!!!,"This cd is another WHO compilation of leftovers and @forgoten songs included as A and B sides of 45 rpm discs. There are some great songs here such as JOIN TOGETHER, THE RELAY, I DONT EVEN KNOW MYSELF, DOGS, HEAVEN AND HELL, WHEN I WAS A BOY AND DR. JECKYL AND MR. HIDE (the latest 3 penned by the late John Entwistle). This cd may be considered as ODDS AND SODS part II.The question is...why did their record company, managers or the band, did not give this songs the treatment they deserved?John Entwistle songs are very very good and the Roger Daltrey penned HERE FOR MORE has a great bridge and the 3 chords the song uses were later used by Pete on Quadrophenia (Sea and Sand, 5.15 and I ve Had Enough.This collection also includes WASP MAN a 3 chord KEITH MOON song originally taken from GLORIA by the band THEM. I all this is another great who collection."
3,"Fair, but Unbalanced . . .","Schaller is correct in asserting that ""newness"" is occurring today in the church, but what if this ""reformation"" is shallow? To grow a church in the next millenium, must leaders ""dumb down"" sermons, change worship into entertainment, and use marketing tactics to get people to attend church? Schaller seems to think these methods are okay as long as a church grows.If there IS a reformation in Schaller's terms, will we create a consumer based, ""give me what I want"" church where folks come to be served rather than to serve?While I am not fighting for the ""past,"" it appears that future church growth may lose a sense of integrity about the larger meaning and mission of individual disciples as they relate to the church as a whole.And if this happens, what kind of ""Christianity"" will American culture espouse 100 years from now?"
5,2001: A Church Odyssey,"Finally. The one Schaller book that every pastor ordenominational officer who is responsible for the futureof any ministry in any church should have to read.Here's a peek at the 21st Century Church thatsociology built--or WILL build. Better wake up andprepare the way. You know you'll have to read this stuffsooner or later. Better sooner.Added bonus: this book contains ""a little bit abouteverything"" for those Schaller readers who have everexperienced a sense of ""everything about every little bit."""
4,solid acoustic number,"excellent acoustic title track, weller circa wildwood. forgettable second track something left off of the ""heavy soul"" album? the third track is a cool 1998 version of the old jam song ""tales from the riverbank"". a must have for any weller enthusiast on the basis of tracks 1 and 3."
5,The Perfect Book Light....,"I absolutely love this little book light. It is so slim and easy to store, plus I can use it for my magazines and paperbacks. I highly recommend this item. A+++"
3,"Great knife, but design flaw","I'll cut to the chase:When the knife is closed, It can be pushed in slightly past its resting point, causing the blade to bump into the handle itself. With this happening repeatedly in your pocket, your brand new blade gets a burr in it, a dent in the blade edge about 1/8 of an inch from the tip.Now, depending on your situation, you can decide if this is a problem. For me, I don't mind it, because overall, this is a great product and dent or not, the blade still cuts where it is undented, which is all I need it for."
3,there's better out there,"I purchased this knife today at my local Northwest Hardware. Everything in the store is over priced but it's close to the house. I paid $18 so I guess it wasn't to bad of a buy. I agree with other reviews upon opening the package it looked used. Without dropping it, it already had scuffs in the metal frame and black grease in some areas. The blade lock is designed to swing up with only a divot on one section and a bump on the latch, it seems like this locking mechanism would wear out quickly. I have noticed you can push the blade in while closed. I don't think that would be much of an issue. It is nice that it has a belt clip and not a cheezy pouch. The wood trim gives a smooth good looking finish. When I have the opportunity to buy one again I would go for the Dewalt folding razor knife or Kobalt's folding razor knife that now comes with a straight knife blade and a saw blade."
5,is it the same?,I bought one of these because I lost my Bessey which looks identical. I'm just as happy with this one. nice heavy feel and good fit and finish.
2,Not Impressed,"I thought I was buying a new knife, when i got the knife it was clearly a used knife. Not impressed with my purchase."
4,Sheffield Utility Knife,"Looks just as good in person as the picture. Sorry to say we haven't used it yet. We had a little trouble figuring out how to close it, but finally did. It appears that it will work well."
5,A Great Book,"I purchased several of the top woodworking books and I think this one is the best of the bunch. If I could keep only one, this would be it. It covers everything, even things as simple as the proper way to measure."
3,"Woodworking, the right technique","There was some interesting information here, particularly about layout and measuring but not much. Perhaps, it would be good for a beginner."
3,tissot watch - not what I really wanted,The picture of the watch is deceptive. There is a design that you can't see because it's white against a white background. The date is very small and difficult to see.
5,Great book to keep kids involved,This was a great book to keep my daughter involved in our trip to Boston. She was excited to go to another location and look for more items in the book. We never heard a whine about having to visit another museum or historic location. I would definitely recommend this book to parents of elementary school age kids. It'll make your vacation less stressful and you might learn things along with your kids.
3,"Not the best, but decent","This book is not the best of all the bird guides out there. Firstly, it is too bulky to be practical to bring anywhere. Second, the art work looks fake. The pages of this book are glossy and are difficult to maneuver through when in a rush. This book may be one of the newest out there, but if you are going to buy a bird guide, buy the Blue Golden Book-Birds of North America, or maybe the Peterson guide. My personal favorite is the Golden book and I believe that most experienced birders will agree with me. The artwork in the Golden book is far more accurate than in any other book on the market. If this is your first time buying a field guide, don't buy this one just because it the most popular one on the market, buy one of the other two I mentioned."
4,"Good for the beginner, since the photos are clear & accurate",I received this book for Mother's Day and have been very pleased with it. I have found out the names of several species that I have seen over the last few weeks. I highly recommend this book for the beginners.
5,The quintessential guide to bird identification.,"Field Guide to the Birds of North America is the most conclusive compilation of species seen in North America. This essential birding tool accurately depicts visually and descriptively, and provides range maps on joining pages (no need to flip around).In the introduction not only do readers learn about scientific terms and classifications but how to identify birds, choosing proper field equipment such as binoculars, and the importance of journalizing observations.I am looking forward to the release of a revised edition this spring!"
4,Good Book for beginners,This book is really good if you are new into birding. Also the shipment was much faster than expected and the book was in good condition being a used book.
1,Waste of your money!!!!!!!,"The fifth edition is going to come out on Nov. 7, 2006 but I already have it!!!! It's much more updated and is much better since it has 7 thumbtabs (Hawks, Sandpipers, Gulls, Flycatchers, Warblers, Sparrows, and Finches) and the quick-find index is now on the side and there's even a map on the back!!!!! The taxonomy is not up-to-date. Canada Goose had been separated as well as the Blue Grouse and many others. I do NOT recommend you to buy this guide. Either wait for the Fifth Edition or go look for other good guides such as Kaufman (this one is a tiny bit outdated(Blue Grouse not split yet) but is easier to use because it has color tabs instead of thumbtabs) or the Sibley Guides (even more outdated). This Edition is a waste of your money so do NOT buy!!!!!!!!!"
2,Not what I expected,"If I'd known this was an anti-evolution Creationist magazine I wouldn't have bought it! It's ok as a magazine, though I think they should invest in more professional writing. But I'm notinterested in teaching my daughter from a creationist viewpoint."
4,I like it and my kids like it.,"The magazine has improved over the years, now with color photos and a more convenient smaller format.Yes, it is creationist and anti-evolutionary.There is a hidden pictures page (not as involved as in Highlights), a drawing lesson with last month's drawing submissions from kids (many different age groups represented), a nature story (usually with character lessons as well), and other features.It's a nice, peaceful, safe, and instructional nature magazine for kids (and some teens) that also promotes good character qualities and honors God as having created everything and everyone with wisdom and love."
4,Nature Friend,We have found this magazine to be extremely interesting with many fun facts and activities. It is well written and well laid-out in terms of wonderful pictures and good articles. We would heartily recommend it to any home!
3,Not quite what I imagined...,"After reading an online review that highly rated this magazine, I decided to get a subscription for my 4.5 year old niece who loves Big Backyard. I was shocked when my sister told me that the magazine was imbedded with religious ideas and stories. I did not realize this from any of the information I had read about the magazine. Apparently, my niece loves the puzzles, games and activities in Nature Friend so I will not cancel her subsciption, but the content of the magazine is from a Creationist viewpoint. So if this is not the message that you want your child to receive about science, I would not recommend this magazine. It is fine for those who adhere to these beliefs, but I think it is important that these views be evident before someone purchases this magazine so they are aware of how it is going to teach their child."
4,A Force To Be Reckoned With,"Ben's back in another DVD with 5 episodes from the second season. They include ""Alone Together"" where Ben and a Highbreed get stranded, ""Good Copy, Bad Copy"" when Ben meets a clone of himself wielding its OWN Omnitrix, and ""Save the Last Dance"" where Kevin attempts to go to the prom with Gwen but he gets sidetracked.The special feature is a sneak peek of brand new characters - some of which are introduced in this DVD.Ben, Gwen, and Kevin know that there's more adventures to come and frankly, it'll be chronicled on the next DVD. Keep watching Cartoon Network for more new episodes as well as the new movie ""Ben 10 Alien Swarm"" !"
1,Fundamentally Flawed,This textbook is based on the premise that the true variance of the distance-weighted average can be replaced with the pseudo kriging variance of a set of degrees-of-freedom and variance-deprived functionally dependent kriged estimates. The distance-weighted average was reborn as an honorific kriged estimate but that could not possibly make its variance vanish without a trace. Just another textbook were the requirement of functional independence and the concept of degrees of freedom are ignored with impunity.
4,bjork before she went crazy with singles,"don't get me wrong, i'm a hardcore bjork fan, but i can't help but feel jipped by her newer singles... (mainly from post on forward). the venus as a boy single actually has a few harder-to-find songs not on her albums, and good, quality remixes. her newer singles are in abundance, but seem to lack the originality and innovation that older ones like these had. this is definetely a good choice for those who are sick of bjork's new marketing technique: release an album, release 2 or 3 bland remix singles of a song on that album, then a box set w/ video, and then a compilation album of all the remixes...i'm going broke trying to collect all of them!! but if you are in search of the essentials, this is one to have."
5,Buy it for Indio!,"There are some memorable songs such as ""Canta Per Me II"" and ""A Farewell Song"" but overall this feels like a four star album. And that's what it would be if not for the amazingly beautiful ""Indio"". This is the song used in the scene that describes Mireille's true feelings toward Kiraka. It's easily the best song from the entire series and a very moving scene. To be honest, this album is worth buying just for this song alone. And if that isn't enough, the lyrics (including English translations) for several songs on OST1 and OST2 are included. If you liked Noir and liked the music from it then this is a must have.Noir: The Complete CollectionNoir Original Soundtrack 2Noir: Blanc Dans Noir"
5,"Color photos, sidebar charts, clear explanations and more make for a fine and comprehensive guide","The 9th updated edition of CREATIVE ACTIVITIES FOR YOUNG CHILDREN offers a comprehensive coverage of two-dimensional activities, development levels, creative language experiences, and a host of learning tools for young kids, making this a top pick for any library strong in early education. Color photos, sidebar charts, clear explanations and more make for a fine and comprehensive guide."
4,Great deal on a scarce film,"I bought this edition of VOODOO MAN to enhance my Bela Lugosi collection. I would highly recommend it for the superior picture and sound quality of the Rifftrax release...not perfect, but by far the best print available. There are a couple of minor cuts in the film, but is far more complete than my older edition which was recorded on VHS tape off of television back in the late 70s then transfered to DVD. Another great feature of the Rifftrax release is the option of playing the movie with or without the riff commentary.For Bela Lugosi fans you just can't beat the value of this release. Pick it up while you still can!"
4,This isn't MST3K,"That being said, these are still pretty funny. I have the box sets of MST3K and the Cinematic Titanic DVD's and they are a hoot. These are right there - just a step below. But don't let that stop you from buying these - they are, as stated previously, still pretty funny."
2,Not much for the money,"I was disappointed too with the collection of three very small books, that had obviously been home-produced - ie photocopied, stapled and inserted into a plastic shell that usually covers xmas cards. I didn't learn that much, other than Jay's designs."
1,Not great,"My first thought how did this pilot fog lamp compare to my Piaa.As other review has stated the wire harness is in deed way too short for most cars even for my corolla. I had to make the harness longer to complete the job at hand. The on/off switch is a joke, I change it to normal on/off switch for a easier installation.I also change the bulb to Sylvania silverStars knowing that they are a better bulb and hopefully that it will improve the light out put. I never did a compare with the stock bulbs that came with the pilot's. So I can't say if it was indeed better.To test this product I drove on some of the near by canyons roads. On a clear night it's not too bad, but when there's fog for get about it. It does more harm then good, even my low beams was doing a better job.Bottom line, it's true about you get what you pay for. Spend a little more money to get something better and you will not regret it. This produce seems more for looks then performance."
2,How to Program book - not Financial Modeling,"This is a ""How To Program"" book which uses financial applications as samples. It is heavy on programming basics and scratches the surface of financial modeling. That's fine if that's what you expect from the book, but the title led me to believe that I'd learn modeling techniques. I expected a book that assumed proficiency in VB and dealt with moderate to advanced financial topics.If you already know what a where clause is and are proficient at VB.Net, this is not for you. If you know nothing about VB and want to learn it using interesting examples, this is for you."
4,Good Intro to .NET for Financial Systems Engineers,"I'm a software engineer who read this while developing an automated trading system. I think the book was aimed more at people who know financial systems engineering but do not know .NET rather than at programmers trying to build financial systems, but I still found it very useful (useful enough so that I have read it twice already). It is well-written and provides insight in a number of different areas.The VB.NET stuff is mostly solid, but anyone wants to use .NET to perform these chores should also read a book that provides a thorough introduction to datasets. Much of the database-centered guidance in the book ignores the dataset, and the dataset is what makes .NET the ideal tool for web database applications. For example, they devote many pages to telling people how to write out an XML file, a chore you can do with a dataset with one line of code (and the dataset never makes a mistake)."
5,Practical Financial Modeling,I found this book to be very useful in helping me develope real time trading applications. These trading applications were developed in Visual Basic and interfaced with the Trading Technolgies X_Trader system. I found myself refering to thisbook very often for ideas and explanations and examples.
5,Great in the classroom,"I have been a Professor of Finance for many years, and am always searching for a good book to use in my classroom. This is one of the best I have come across in a long time. It will be part of my required reading from now on."
4,Par for the course.,"This is the third of, at this point, five collections of entries to the annual Bulwer-Lytton Fiction contest, a contest in which the goal is to write the worst possible opening sentence to the worst of all possible novels.Like all of the others of its kind, this book is tremendously enjoyable for those who find amusement in the intentional lampooning of bad writing. I must say that I found it the least amusing of the lot, but that still leaves it a marvellously funny romp. Well worth the effort of tracking down a copy."
4,Masterful,"This is a selection from a 1937 performance of the Ring. Furtw'ngler is my all time favorite conductor of Wagner and he lives up to his reputation. The singing is also excellent, only marred by old recording equipment that does not adequately capture the wonderful performance. Any Wagner lover will enjoy these CDs, despite the less than good reproduction of the 1937 sound (which is why I gave it only 4 stars).Since writing this review a couple years ago, I must say that this is a CD that I listen to repeatedly. It has become one of my favorites in my Wagner collection."
2,Somewhat of a letdown :(,"Unfortunately, this game does not live up to the original. The original game featured well known songs that were reimagined to fit in well with the drums. There were few songs that I didn't like and have fun playing with.The tracks on the sequel are unimaginative and bland. They all sound the same. It's about impossible to discern what song it is in song selection mode if you don't know it from the song title because the introductions to all the songs sound the same.In the original game, the songs were a bit different than the original including original vocal stylings and the music was arranged to sound cool accompanied by bongos. The new songs are just standard arrangements with substandard vocalists.On a positive note, the mini games are much improved and more fun to play."
4,Donkey Conga,"I know you can probably not even buy the drums anymore, but if you have them, this is a great game. It is much more sophisticated that the original and it has more levels/options you can play. My son loves it and tells me that it is ""way more"" fun than the original PS2 game that the drums come with."
1,Deeply subjective and one-sided view of complex reality,"The author brings very subjective, one-sided and frankly anti-Semitic and anti-Israeli view of a complex reality the State of Israel exist. Many things are wrong in the book. Beginning from mentioning that there is no sign to Tamra (there is and always was a huge bilingual (Arabic-Hebrew) sign), and ending with statement that Israel Army destroyed 400 Palestinian villages, when there were barely 200 in all Palestine (size of Massachusetts). Don't waste your time and money on this fiction."
5,wonderful,"A lot of books have been published about Israel. Many are good, but far to difficult for normal, average people.Susan's book: The other side of Israel is very very good.It's written in such a simple way you get through it in no time. As a reader it makes you hunger for more and more and more.That on it's own would be enough for me to urge others to buy it. But it also exposes the very core of the conflict. It shows how racism has become a part of the state of Israel.In all the stories that are being told history plays a great part, which helps to explain the conflict from that angle.It's a fascinating and educative book, one of the best so far!!! Out small organisation in Belgium already promotes this book anywhere possible.Myriam----- Original Message -----"
5,The truth shall set us free,"Not many people in the ""west"" know about the roughly one million Palestinians who are citizens of Israel but live under an apartheid system. How can any of us form reasonable opinions about the Middle East when all we know about it is Zionist propaganda about ""a land without a people for a people without a land"" and ""making the desert bloom""? All lies! Susan Nathan emigrated to Israel as a Zionist Jew like many others. Luckily she is also a humanist. What she saw shocked her, and led her on a remarkable journey of discovery that ended with her living in the ""Arab"" town of Tamra in the Galilee. Her story is compelling reading and essential for anyone who wants to understand what is happening in Palestine/Israel."
5,a mirror of Israel daily atrocities and war crimes aginst humanity,"This book shatters, beyond any doubt, the Israeli myths which had and, unfortunately still, been circulating in the main stream American media that Israel is a ""democratic"" country!The authour proves beyond a shadow of ANY doubt that the Jewish state is not only un-demcratic but an Apartheid state. The authour being a Jewess herself who is a Jewess herself, lends significat credibility to all of this...a MUST read."
1,What about Australian aborigines?,Do Australian aborigines have exactly the same standard of living that Australians of European descent do? Does Australia practice apartheid? Are you outraged by this? Will you do a follow-up book in the outback?
1,Nathan is disgustingly naive or just plain antisemitic.,"I have read the book and have seen Nathan speak. She clearly despises Jews. Her reckless commentary, divisive language, and apparent willingness to endanger the people she sees as victims is reprehensible. This book is far more about Nathan's self-congratulation than her commitment to improving the lives of Palestinians."
3,It doesn't work very well!,"When I connected this sprayer to my hose, it just ""spit"" out. I tried changing hoses, but got the same result; I also tried empting out about half of the liquid that I had in the sprayer, but that didn't help either."
1,Amazon is cheap!,I can't rate the item if I can't listen to the album. Amazon is happy to let you take your time to fill out a review- free and effortless promotion of the items they are selling- but much to cheap to buy you a listen!
1,I must be an idiot??? (Don't answer that...),"For the life of me I cant get this thing to work. The nut on top is impossible to adjust (without pliers or a nutcracker). It came with no instructions, and there are none about adjusting it on the web site. The few times I""ve tried to use it it's putting out gigantic cracked peppercorns -- useful sometimes, but I can't adjust to a fine, or even finer grind. Hoping someone who raved (they ALL raved, so I bought!) will post something helpful. I know how to cook and I am not arthritic, but this thing, I;ve wanted to toss through a window several times already. HELP! Otherwise 'the last peppermill you'll ever need' is going back, having so far been the worst one I've ever had!"
2,salt or pepper?,"asked how do you tell salt from pepper? answer was they have letters on top; turns out only salt does, on mine it was a dirty decal, pasted on off center that peeled when i adjusted the top knob; mills work pretty well, gets boring having to tell guests which is which; so easy to fix and mfg didn't bother; they did bother to burn in mfg name vic firth and the word gourmet, like we need to be seeing that on table every day- that, but not an s or a p"
5,nice to use and looks great on the counter,"This is probably the nicest looking thing in my kitchen. It is not just good looking though, it is good at its job. I grind pepper every day for my breakfast and preparing my lunch for work. The thing is easy to fill,just need to remove the top nut and then pour new peppercorns into the chamber. When you do fill it though, you are loosening the adjustment nut and so have to readjust and you'll probably drop some pepper out the bottom so be prepared to spill on some food or over the sink if you have no need at the time. Easy to adjust, I'm not too picky though I prefer slightly larger bits.The finish is so nice and tight and the wood so dense that it doesn't seem to get wet even though my hands aren't always super-clean when I pick it up (I am in the middle of cooking after all). For measured pepper requirements I use the canned stuff though I probably won't buy more canned and will have to grind into a small bowl for measuring from."
3,"bearpaw women slippers ""sheepskin""",I bought it for my wife and she loved it because it's soft and comfortable but it didn't last for more than three months of the day we purchased it. I won't recommend it to anyone.
5,Magnificent Ireland at its Best,"I've ordered several of the Ireland DVDs and I found this is the one I want to watch over and over again. I have even purchased one for a friend. It is correct that there is no narration, but the scenic areas covered are listed on the back of the DVD and if you follow along as you watch, you can keep track of what they're showing, and there is an occasional placename on the screen. The music is good. If you are into the beautiful scenery of Ireland and not a lot of tourist hype, I think you will like this a lot. It is my favorite, and the only one I recommend currently. It will inspire you to dream of a trip to Ireland. It's certainly worth the current price!"
1,Not so Magnificent,"This DVD is not so ""magnificent"" as indicated by some of the reviews found here. Some of the scenes are nice, but the editing and transfer leave much to be desired. The music also, is not a good fit in my opinion. If you are looking for an exceptional musical travelogue of Ireland, I would highly recommend ""Portrait of Ireland"" featuring James Galway, Enya and the Chieftains. It has excellent cinematography with great music to scenery match."
4,Enjoyable but not usefull.,"This is a beatifull DVD but it has absolutely no travel info. But it is very inspiring, you will want to go to Irealnd after watching this video."
2,NOT HELPFUL FOR PLANNING A TRIP,"I purchased the DVD with the hope of viewing parts of Ireland that my wife and I had not yet had the opportunity to see on vacation. We recognized places we had been, but the lack of audio or text does not give you and clue as to where the beautiful location is or how you may find out more about it. Would not recommend if you were looking for a DVD that provides information or insight on planning a trip. Great if you want to see how beautiful Ireland is and listen to some elevator music. Could not watch the entire DVD at approx. 60 minutes, just too boring."
2,Video of Ireland,"The service provided by all in the purchase and delivery of this item was exemplary. It arrived more quickly than I expected, and the purchase was seamless. The product itself is a disappointment. I have seen an hour-long video of Ireland which is all aerial views, shot apparently from a helicopter, and covering most of Ireland, with beautiful accompaning music track. I was hoping that this was that tape; alas, this is not that tape. This tape is largely shot from the ground, has a fair number of still shots, and the music track is not as good as the one I hoped for."
4,External Hard Drive for Dish,"I purchased this case to enable me to use unused hard drives with our Dish DVR receiver. Connected to Dish USB, I am able to move instructional (DIY etc) videos and movies from the DVR to the external hard drives, woodworking on one (black), Food network (blue) on another, Sci-Fi (red) on yet another, etc. I am able to unplug one NexStar then plug in another NexStar and Dish recognizes them and I can play back HD movies from the NexStar enclosure - Great enclosures"
4,Runs cooler than I expected,"This enclosure is very nice looking. It was a little tricky to get together, but my 500GB drive runs surprising cool. I am happy with the enclosure and might buy another."
4,Good Looking items,"I own several enclosures, I was looking in the market for a new one for my new 1.5TB which is not easy to find, this one is very good, my HD now is set inside a good blue design quite case (noise is number one issue for me). Installation was very easy, nice blue light indicator in the front panel. I received it 4 weeks ago and the performance is very good. My only worry is about cooling down in the road I would prefer one with cooling fan because most of the time I forget my drive on."
5,Good product,"I needed a USB enclosure to retrieve data off of several older IDE drives, this worked perfectly. Although it does require some minor (un)screwing to swap out or insert drives, its quite simple and does what it's supposed to, I haven't found any flaws with it."
3,THEIR ARE BETTER ON THE MARKET,"The nextar NST-360U2-BL has good performance nice body, 2way stand optionsis verry fast and isolates the hard drive sound verry good,but the adapter is a bit large and kind of sloppy.also the ide 2inch IDE cable is a [...].broke of the same day a bought is, but i raplced it with another wich verry dificult to find with the lenght."
3,Vantec NexStar NST-360U2,Product performed well albeit a bit cramped for the cables etc. inside for its size. I have a Philips Mobile storage unit and it is smaller and with a better inside layout. Vendor sent product on time and it arrived without damage. All in all a good product that gets the job done.
4,Performed as expected and needed,"`I was not looking for a permanent drive connection, but an economical way to check for and transfer files from old drives. Swapping out drives did take some time and care: snug fit, disconnecting LED plug, moving ribbon around projections, but not significantly an inconvenience (far less so than internal to the tower). I also powered down the drive and disconnected the USB each time. For each drive change, there was a moment's wait for recognition and then functioned well with full access. I did not run the drives for more than 30 mins and did not noticed any significant heating of the housing. Using WinXP Home SP3 with an NTFS drives."
2,drive was not easy to install,This drive was not easy to install and use. I tried connected it to my laptop but was unsuccessful to install. I tried to back up all my daughters' photo and video. It seems difficult to install.
4,Nice drive but picture misleads,"Having dealt only with seriously ghetto enclosures prior to this one, it was nice to get a drive of quality heft and construction. Install was a snap, and I got no complains on performance. Only quibble I have is that the drive I got is a more subdued blue, almost navy-- not really very reflective-- I was all excited to get a vibrant shiny electric blue like in the picture, but it almost may as well be black unless the room's real brightly lit. Most people probably don't care about that kind of crap but my whole computer, mouse, and keyboard light up a vibrant blue and I thought it would go nicely. Ok yes I'm a geek, shut up."
5,ExACTLY what I needed,"When my computer crashed, I was in the process of backing up files and still had hundreds of pictures and documents to save. I would have been heartbroken had this product not been available to save the day. I have nothing but good to say about it. First of all, it arrived within days of ordering it from Amazon. Then, it worked just like it said it would. Installation was a breeze and with my new computer which runs Vista, all I did was plug it in and VOILA! all my files were available.The price is right. The style is sleek. The performance is exactly as promised. Highly recommend."
1,Doesn't Power All IDE Hard Drives,"I purchases two of these hard drive enclosures (one red, one blue,) because first I liked the design and more importantly the 4.5 star rating and good reviews. However, for some reason, they do not power all hard drives. Some hard drives turn on when you flip the power switch and some do not. I have no explanation for this as other enclosures power the hard drive just fine. I don't know if it's a correlation that they are both Western Digital or not but I would expect any IDE hard drive enclosure to power them properly.I'm sorry to give an item 1 star, but again, it's supposed to power an IDE and it does not."
2,Soundesign 3106 Bird Sounds Unlike Real Birds,"The clock I received was defective - the hour hand was off by 25 minutes (e.g., the hour hand was almost half way between 1 & 2 when the minute hand was on 12).The sounds were only similar to the birds songs that I can hear out my back door - not close enough to reality. I think we want reality so we can recognize the bird songs we hear in nature.A wonderful Idea, but not carried out very well. By the way - the clock is made in China."
2,Works good until they go South,"We use these for several Fiber connections between our City locations. Problem is it seems when they have been on for ""years"" and then you take power away from them they seem to never come back up.They do the job but in the past 5 years I have had to replace 6 or 7 units and we ONLY have 6 in production. Haven't tried any others and when I asked could I go to a different brand my answer was to stay with what we have. So I have 2 replacements at all times....."
2,More Toy than Tool!,"I bought one of these trackballs, thinking it would be a serviceable mobile tool to complement my two Compac notebooks, but it turns out that, above the fact that the button controls are completely different from any other unit and require relearning a new system, the trackball control is a major maintenance problem, using tiny steel pins with soft rubber friction contacts which shed dust debris at such a rate the trackball requires cleaning almost every session it is used. Even when clean, the track function continues to stick and jump, rendering the unit nearly useless for serious work. Give it to the kids for the toy it is."
4,back cover,"Formerly published as two seperate volumes, these complimentary studies of two great Western patriots represents van Loon at his remarkable best. Thomas Jefferson is interpreted boldly, yet seensitively; plainly, yet with an almost idealistic fervor, and a freshness and living quality in the portrait that are very stirring.Simon Bolivar is presented not only as a great emancipator, but as a liberator working against a difficult and sometimes hopeless background - a man of great vision and common sense who had one great solution for our material evils - the establishment of a United States of both Americas.Hendrik Willem van Loon is best remembered for his classic ""Story of Mankind."""
1,didn't protect my equipment,"I love the design of this thing, but it didn't protect my equipment -- a power surge fried one of my RAM modules and one of my hard drives."
5,Very handy to have this Surge,I use this to organized my media center and it works well to managed all my plugs into its proper position. Love it!
4,Desk top charger plugins,I purchased this as a desk top charger plug in for all of my chargers this way I can leave them plugged in and hook up to them when ever I need to charge one of my devices.
4,Great for computer and size is super,I like this surge protector because it is not a foot long yet it has plenty of plug in locations. We use it daily and really like the portability and shape benefits.
4,Nice Design,"Great design to allow more usage than a regular ""power strip"". Seems to be of solid construction. Great price as well. And I agree with other reviewers... It would get five stars if the cord came out perpendicular to the wall socket rather than parallel."
5,Fellowes CRC99090 Mighty 8 Surge,"I was looking for a new extension and surge power cord since mine kept losing power and made a loud beeping noise. I would definitely recommend buying this product as it is small and compact. It does not take up a lot of space like most power surge cords. There is a lot of space for different sized plugs on the outlet. I was worried since most of the outlets seemed spaced together. However, the two outlets on the right and left outer side of the device allow for larger sized plugs to fit. I currently have my printer, external hard drive, computer charger, and monitor plugged in and nothing has short circuited. Great purchase and will probably buy another one for my dad."
4,Clever arangement of outlets,"I know you are not supposed to but tons of plugs into one outlet, but these days what are you going to do with all these electronics? I like the arrangement of these outlets so that you can use the large transformer type plugs and not block (thus waste) other outlets. The price was reasonable for this product as well."
5,Solid and more versatile than strip surge protectors,"There are some places where a strip surge protector just doesn't make sense. Until now, I hadn't really looked into exploring other options. So when I happened upon the Fellowes CRC99090 Mighty 8 Surge, imagine my surprise. The product is solid and much more versatile on account of how the outlets are arranged. Even better, the price is reasonable enough to pick up more than one to use around the house."
3,Great for fans of 'Under a Blood Red Sky',"If all you want is ""Sweetest Thing,"" then at this price, you might as well buy the whole 'Best of 1980-1990' compilation. (The version here is no different.) But for those who are serious fans of the live 'Under a Blood Red Sky' (1983), there are two additional Red Rocks performances not originally included on that record - ""Twilight"" and ""An Cat Dubh""."
4,Great for the 'Boy' Live Tracks,"The song itself, is nothing spectacular. U2 rerecorded or remastered this song for their Greatest Hits 1980-1990 compilation, and in my own opinion have made a song that is worse than the original. However, it takes a diehard fan to probably notice the difference. Never-the-less, if ""The Sweetest Thing"" is all you are interested in, go for the BEst of disc and if you can get the 2 disc version which includes the original B-Sides version and this reworking.My reason for giving this disc 4 stars is in the live tracks. Here are two tracks from the Red Rocks concert that did not make the Under a Blood Red Sky CD. Yet, these two songs are wonderful U2 songs, and they sound really great live. LIstening to these songs makes me wish they would rework the whole Under a Blood Red Sky album into a full concert CD. That would be awesome. As it is, if you like that concert CD and the U2 studio work before that, especially Boy, these B-Sides should make you happy."
3,patch kit,I'm fortunate enough that I havn't had to use this yet !! Wish me luck ! I have friends and grandkids ... so I know I'll need this patch kit in the future!!
4,Making a Difference Right On Your Block,"The Mennonite Conciliation Service's well-practiced manual provides a practical system of conflict mediation for use in one-on-one and group conflict mediation. The book assumes a Mennonite Christian perspective on why and how we seek to resolve conflict in our lives. The system is somewhat complicated, so I would urge you not to just dive in and assume you can solve people's problems on your own. However, taken in conjunction with some practical experience and guidance, or as an addition to conflict training on your own, this manual will help you to solve conflict without resorting to win or lose situations."
2,not as good as it sounds,"The Whole Dog Journal seems to be focused on making you feel good by giving your dog ""extra good care"". However, what the Whole Dog Journal considers to be ""extra good care"" is merely opinion, not based on science. I am especially suspect of the food recommendations. One bright point is the training/behavior articles by Pat Miller. For health and nutrition advice, I suggest one of the newsletters by Tufts or another of the top veterinary schools."
1,Inessential,I might be wrong but aren't all these tracks now on the reissued 'show'. I read the reviews of 'sideshow'and thoght they were from another gig.
1,BEWARE--NOT THE ORIGINALS,"I am so tired of music compilations that are re-recordings or live versions, and not the originals. This is one of them. The audio is not as bad, or the versions as tired, as on some discs, but most if not all of these are not the original recordings. If you're looking for the hits of your youth, keep looking."
1,Mrs. Fields White Chunk Macadamia,If you buy these you run the risk of getting rancid nut cookies. They looked a bit odd and tasted even odder. One cookie was bitter. I guess it was the tiny macadamia nut bits that were the problem. Don't buy them!
5,Great Deal,Loved the books. Condition of the books is good for the age.Gave them to a Beveridge relative of the author and was proud to make the gift.
5,"Great and Insightful, but hampered by typos","I enjoyed reading this book very much, but far more for the content than for the craft used in writing and editing. There are many errors in the text that could be excised by more careful proofreading and using a spell checker (how many ways can you spell Cursillo?) but the thrust of the subject matter overpowers this criticism. Powerful testimonies to the power of Christ through this ecumenical ministry will bring tears to your eyes. Dramatic evidence of ministering to ""the least of these my brethren,"" and the contagious enthusiasm inherent among the people interviewed are the conspicuous hallmarks of this book, and make it a good choice for your reading list."
5,Kawabata at his best,"Although Kawabata is most often associated with his better than good Palm-of-the-hand stories, I don't view them as my favorate Kawabata work. The Dancing Girl of Izu (mandatory reading for Japanese Junior High School Students) is a sort of coming of age story that made me step back and reflect. The semi-autobiographical work is tender, heart warming, and a keen glimpse into Japanese life. If you have read and enjoyed earlier works of this author I would strongly suggest this collection to you. If you have yet to discover Kawabata, I say there's no better place to start!"
2,Not my thing,"Poetic evocations of loss and of what could have been - but on the whole, a clean miss for my tastes.Sorry, I wanted to like it. My 'stars' rating isn't about any grand kind of literary merit, just about how much I liked it, and mostly didn't.-- wiredweird"
2,Nice watch but no working properly,"I bought this watch as a gift to my brother. At first everything seemed ok. Everything up until my brother went to check what I was cooking and opened the pot. The watch is not well sealed and got steam under the glass. No my brother did no let his wrist inside the pot, he just opened and closed the lid. I live in a very hot place, and it has been over a 100 degrees. My brother watch has been looking like it has never left the kitchen. The watch is beautiful, all the features work fine, good priceand delivered ahead of time but it is not well seald and if you plan getting it wet, or live in a hot country I would not recommend the purchase."
1,not working,"I am from Brazil, and I bought this watch before arriving in America. I asked to be shiped to the hotel I had the reservation. When I got at the hotel, the watch was aready there, but when I came back to Brazil, and gave it to my son as a gift, the watch was not working. My son got very disappointed, and so did I. What do I have to do now???????"
1,Peice of Junk,Watch to big cheap japan movement looses 5 secounds in a two week time frame so you have to set the time regulary Beware do not buy this crap!!!!
2,Very nice watch. Bad button material,"It's a nice watch, very solid. But the material they are built side buttons, is plastic, or something similar. This causes them to break and are eaten in parts. Cracked into pieces. That's a serious problem, because I do not have spare parts for it."
4,great watch,"this nautica watch is great, you can use in sports or casual moments, i want to know if i can buy the band in other colors."
4,seems to be a good watch,"I bought the Nautica chronograph N14536G a couple of days ago. Prompt delivery. Received the watch in good condition. The watch itself looks as good as it does on the screen... a good, solid watch... sporty looks and feel. Some might think it is heavy, which it probably is, but I have no problems there. My main complain is that the manual that comes with the watch is useless... does not have specifications/ help for this particular model. Also the seconds hand is the tiny dial at the 6 O'Clock position and the main ""seconds"" dial is for the stop watch, which I find weird in a watch.Overall, I think it is a good buy, if you don't mind a heavy watch. I even got a pair of Nautica binoculars free!! And no one can beat Amazon's price."
1,Poor product quality,I bought the watch for the reviews and guide me as I was using it I realized that the crown was broken so I can not place it in the local time and last but not least I want to recognize the cost of shipping to make the corresponding replacement.
2,Hope you have a large wrist...,"I tried wearing the watch and it was so large (or my wrist was so small),that it pressed into the back of my hand and was painful. I tried it both on my right wrist (I am left handed) and my left wrist and in both cases I had the problem. I had to return the watch. I suggest you try it on in a ""Bricks and Mortar"" store before buying it."
2,"Very nice watch to look at, and works fine, but is not water resistant.","I had this watch for a week now, 2 days ago I took a bath with it, and I got humidity on the glass, and I has not go away. I live in Uruguay so is not like I can use the warranty, may be is just this one that is a defective one, but I've seen the same comment in other reviews. If you have one, and you did some swimming or something with no problems, please leave a comment. Thank you."
2,Simply too big,"This product would be great if it were smaller and lighter. As it is, it reaches almost comical proportions on my wrist."
5,great watch,"i got it a week ago, so far it is great the feel and the look i like the size of the watch it is not to big and not to small. love it"
3,que paso con mi orden,"que paso con mi orden ,por que razon no me lo han enviado? ya ha pasado un tiempo y nadaNautica N14536 hombres NST Chronograph Watch"
3,not a good knife,I do not like the knife. the edge is hard to clean and gets caught on everything. I wanted a fine edge blade not serrated one.
4,"Good, but I was mistaken","This is a good knife, but if you are looking for a good all around knife, like a santoku or chef's, then this aint it. I did not notice that it was serated until it came. My bad. it really limits the uses of the knife. but very sharp anyways"
5,Excellent Knife,"Excellent knife ! I would recommend it to everyone. Literally cuts like ""Butter"". Makes cooking even more of a pleasure."
2,Poorly made handle,"The metal on the underside of the handle is not flush with the plastic handle itself. This slight overlap makes the knife much less comfortable to hold. The blade is adequate, but the handle is not!"
3,good quality knife with a couple quirks,the knife feels very good and seems to be good quality but I find it to not be as easy to work with as my other knives. The fine serrated edge makes it more difficult to slide the knife along the cutting board during chopping or to scoop things off the board. There is also a bevel on the fine serrated edge that causes it to push the knife to the right when I cut through harder vegetables. I'll probably use this more for cutting meat than vegetables.
1,Not a good buy,"From the reviews for this knife it seemed like a good buy, but the blade is too thin and mine had a big burr on the end that catches on everything it touches. Would have returned it, but had to destroy the packaging to get the knife out. At least it was not expensive so did not waste too much money."
5,Reading Reflex and JuMP Math for struggling students,"Reading Reflex and the JUMP at home series are among the best materials for parents/teachers to use when providing either initial or remedial instruction to students (with learning disabilities or other delays) in literacy or numeracy. Both Reading Reflex and JUMP Math provide excellent strategies, with full explanations and examples, to use in teaching the child.The prices on Amazon were the best value I could find.Judy CraigRetired school administratorReading Consultant"
3,not user frendly,I liked there old format.This new format is hard to use.I still haven't figured out how to add places of interest.
2,Delorme Street Atlas,I have the 2006 and thought I would get this to upgrade...well it is a lot more difficult to use...can't figure out why they just didn't add the road changes to the old format...
2,Very Poor Routing System,"I upgraded from 2003 Street Atlas. The new one has even poorer routing.If I go from Page, AZ to Ann Arbor, MI. This new version routes me on a 4 wheel drive road (for over 50 miles) even though I have Freeway preferences set. There is no way to exclude Canada. Re-entry to the U.S. is so difficult, (soon to require a passport), the speed limits are 62 MPH max in Canada, and the fuel, especially Premium, is unbelievably expensive and I do not want to go there when I am trying to go to Vermont. There should be a way to exclude and include certain roads and countries. No routing (except shortest possible) should include dirt roads. I am 64 and went on an 8400 mile trip last summer. It was difficult to force this program to route me where I wanted to go. I use the GPS option with it and the GPS works most of the time, except it SNAPS back when trying to look ahead or at alternative routes while driving, very annoying."
4,Cute,"Love it, have another pair of silver cats,about the same size so I sometimes splitthe 2 pairs make it one cat with one fishbone, perfect match!"
2,not as good as appears,"while the design is nice and the concept, this stand was not able to support my cage which was not very heavy. the bolt on the hook doesn't secure enough and I happened to hear the bolt slip and was able to remove the cage before it came crashing down. I feel very fortunate that I was home at the time I can only think in horror of what could've happened to my bird if i wasn't home and he came crashing down. The cage doesn't specify any weight limits on the website and also came with no instructions to put it together only a diagram. but that should not be their excuse, it was put together for me by a professional handyman."
1,Consumer Beware,"Product arrived in worn box. White finish was chipped at fittings and rust was evident on all the connecting pieces. Enamel was stained in several places because of rust(inside) plastic sleeves. - This was either a piece returned used and repackaged, or was stored in a wet area.Totally unacceptable and a real dissapointment after so many pleasant transactions through this medium. X-Treme cages has lost my business."
3,dude never once...,"mentions the beatles, the kinks or the stones or the floyd or the who--or any pop music for that matter (and i am an academic in comparative lit and film). you gotta take the rock into account, pete! scattered argumentation. coffee table bait. for total novitiates only (maybe!). his LONDON book is an only intermittently fascinating mess as well. avoid!"
3,Capturing The National Essence In A Net Of Allusions,"When a book and a head collide, and there is a hollow-sounding thump, the thump isn't always coming from the book. That said, as much as I was impressed by this book, I didn't really get a whole lot out of it. For one thing, I'm not English, and therefore many of the touchstones of the national character presented here resonated with me at second-hand, if at all. For another, Peter Ackroyd is so fearsomely learned that many of the references and allusions here were unknown to me, and many of the explications were over my head. Plus, the subject is so abstract, if not amorphous, that the reader must necessarily hold the mood of many successive passages to get the cumulative impact that is intended. It's not surprising that your average culturatus will flag on this journey.There are plenty of fine passages here, though, resulting in quite lapidary reading, in all senses of that adjective."
2,Boring pedantry,"Ackroyd has an encyclopedic knowledge of English literature and so drops fascinating factoids and snippets of quotes throughout this long and boring book. Throughout the ages he attributes the opposing strains of melancholy and optimism to English literature, plus lots of other opposing attributes. Save your money and your time."
2,Too large..,"I loved the color and design of this belly ring. However, I found that the actual ring looked REALLY large in my piercing. My navel piercing isn't very deep, but it also isn't too thin. I believe I wasted my money on something I'll never use."
3,"Not about the team or league, just the players","The book is OK but 3/4 of it is bios for every player who ever played for the Seals. The description makes it sound like it covers the team, and especially Finley, but ownership is poorly covered. This section comes across as a chore for the writer, who really wants to write about every player. It spends a few pages on every player who ever laced up his skates for the seals. That is not bad in itself, but one can only read so many ""Canadian boy done good"" and ""veteran joining the young guys"" stories before it becomes a grind.At $3.99 it's just barely worth the price to read decent coverage about the team, although there are better books about the NHL's expansion. If you love stories and buyers about players then it's a steal. I was more interested in stories about the management of the team and found it disappointing when that portion of the book was over shortly into it."
4,"Decent, but outdated format","Used this tape on a recent visit to Rome - was helpful, but it is on a standard size cassette tape, and I had to search to find a handheld size recorder to play this format. Also comes with a map of the original forum, which helped to orient us during the walking tour."
3,Not bad,My daughter liked it and played some time and started saving some money. But one day she say pink one on babys r us and she wanted that. Kids are like that only but this is nice one.
4,In His Ex-Wife's Shadow,Wanda is to be commended...she brilliantly portrayed a relationship that many Black women have experienced and/or are experiencing. The ending is a strong message that exemplifies true love...of self and another. Write On!
5,In His Ex-Wife's Shadow,"My husband and I both have read this book and found it to be very good. It kept you in suspense and you always felt that it sounds like someone you know or have known in your life at one time or another. It seem to be a true story although we knew it was fiction. The Arthor's dedication to her parents was very nice and also her acknowledgments were good. Giving God the honor, praise and glory that he deserves. The characters were so real, especially Steven. There seems to be a Steven in almost everyone's life. I would have given this one a ten rating if you had allowed"
4,We all can relate!,"We all one way or another have been subjected to the likes of a ""Steven"". The book will take you back to those days. It will help also to ease your mind that justice prevails. If you are a Washingtonian or Philadelphian, you'll love reminiscing to the areas discussed in the book."
1,In His Ex-Wife's Shadow,This book was sent to the Los Angeles Chapter Black Women's Bookclub. The book had very shallow characters in it. I found it difficult to belive that someone could be so naive and basically stupid. The ending was weak and didn't bring complete closure to all the characters. I would have liked to see more development of the main character.
3,A good summer read,"In His Ex-Wife's Shadow is a good first novel from Wanda Moorman. It's a quick read, the characters are likable, and those familiar with the Philadelphia and Washington, DC areas will enjoy seeing them highlighted. Add this one to your summer reading list."
4,A Must Read!!!,"""In His Ex-Wife's Shadow"" was a captivating, easy read! I felt like I was a next door neighbor, ""treeboxing"" each characters daily activities! The chapters are short and detailed only enough to make you want MORE! Couldn't put it down until I was finished. My only disappointment was that it ended. This author is destine to FAME!"
1,What is the point?,"What a waste of money. I received an e-mail from this author suggesting I read this book. She made it seem so good so I decided to give it a try. Well, I want my money back. What does the title have to do with the story? Wanda please keep your day job."
3,The Plot Keeps You Turning The Pages!,"The plot is a page turner. You won't want to put this book down. While I was reading ""In His Ex-Wife's Shadow"" I kept wondering what was going to happen between Angela and Steven. The pace is good and taut. What did I feel when I finished reading ""In His Ex-Wife's Shadow""? Satisfied! It's a book that teaches and encourages us to make the best choices when it comes to ourselves and those we choose to share our lives with."
4,concrete inspection manual,"It is a concise book on the use, placement, and curring of concrete. It was published in 1976. It is a great manual for an inspector of concrete, of which I am. It is a great reference to use, placement, and strength."
1,Is This The End?,"What is music coming to? is this where the new age of music is taking us..Metal was always about the heroes such as Ozzy, Iron Maiden, Alice Cooper, Ac/dc, and so on.This band leads metal into a horrible direction.If there were a pattern to come from the likes of this band, metal would disinigrate into a pile of annoying distorted poser angst and disgust. I hope this is not where music is going."
3,Just OK,"Not really what I was looking for, but good for what it is. I was hoping for more pipe music, and more examples of little girls dancing, something my young daughter could watch to get a good idea of what she might be able to learn at a Celtic dancing class. But because it wasn't really what I wanted doesn't mean its bad. It's actually quite well-produced and enjoyable on its own."
2,Irish dancing,"Comparing with the show I attened the Irish festival in Columbus OH, I would like to pay the ticket to get there than purchase this DVD"
