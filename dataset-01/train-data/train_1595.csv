1,NO,Just too hard to stay on and not realistic. Tried the recipes and some are very good but lots of cooking and time.
5,try it,"I was looking for ideas for feeding my family and keeping all of us in the zone. this is it. Also has good discriptions (what they are, where to find them) of some basic ingredients that are used a lot in the zone. Good info to help get your kitchen stocked. Yummy recipes."
2,Title is a Joke.,"I feel bad giving it one star because so much effort was put into it.I have no idea where they came up with the title but I don't see how anyone could consider 20-30 min. prep times using 2 pages of ingredients ""Meals in Seconds."" Also, you'd have to be pretty well off to afford most of these meals. They call for exotic ingredients or large amounts of expensive fruits.Additionally, I wouldn't start out with this book as a platform for learning the Zone diet. There's very little explanation.Overall, unless you're free time-rich, already a zone diet expert, and a millionaire, just pass."
4,"Recipes are good, but not necessarily simple","I thought I was going to find real time-saving recipes, but I was wrong. However, the book is full of great info!"
4,Zone Meals in Seconds,Always a kitchen staple especially if your following his meal plans.Somethings have to be bought at the supermarket and in order to followhis program.
1,In Seconds?? This deserves a Star Minus,"I was soooo looking forward to the arrival of this book but soooo disappointed when it arrived. It is a typical dime a dozen healthy recipe book for ""foodies"". I was looking for and expected some really quick and uncomplicated ideas for eating in the Zone. I have a book that does this much better by Joyce & Gene Daoust called 40-30-30 Fat Burning Nutrition ""The Zone Made Easy"". It was published in 1996 but hits the target much closer if you are looking for quick and uncomplicated ideas for eating in the Zone."
4,Wrong Title,"First of all, I would like to say that The Zone Diet has changed my life! I have clearer focus, and can think better, sleep better, and I'm happier. I bought this book thinking it would help me cook faster meals. Lynn Sears understands the dilemma, but the book doesn't really address how to eat quick Zone meals, and they are VERY expensive. So far I haven't been able to make one recipe because I can't afford ALL of the ingredients! However, the ideas, the advice about eating out, and everything except the recipes is extremely helpful. Borrow the book from someone first."
2,Zone in Seconds--yeah right!,"The title of this book is a bit mis-leading. Many of the recipes call for many, many ingredients and the prep time is off. For example, one recipe says 20 min. prep time. But after you read it, it says to put something in the fridge for several hours. Making a lifestyle change like the Zone is hard enough without adding the frustration of buying sooo many ingredients and putting together complicated recipes. Plus, chicken and Salmon are about the only ingredients as meats. Where's pork or turkey?"
5,It's true!,Lots of meal recipes for eating healthy with minimal preparation time. I recommend this book to all my friends. It is especially good for single people because lots of recipes are for one person. There are also chapters on slow-cooker recipes and Zone meals for kids. It's a five-star all the way.
5,Faces of Rainforest,This book is beautifully put together. The photos tell an incredible story. I want to see more of his work.
5,Love it!,"This jacket is exactly what I was looking for. Comfortable, soft, lightweight but warm. Perfect for class nights!"
2,british people on heavy sedatives,I am a huge fan of a lot of older british horror like hammer and amicus studios used to put out but this one is a boring waste of time.
4,"Swift, Sultry, and Sexy",28 Hotel Rooms is a sleek drama about a writer and businesswoman having an affair through out their travels in the United states in a myriad of hotel rooms. The film is put together much like an affair; not many details of the characters are revealed (would you tell your mistress everything about your life? I sure wouldn't...) and the overall mystery adds to the steamy scenes through out the different hotel rooms. The two characters get thrown into an on-the-road relationship that grabs your compassion despite being an affair. Not many dramas like this one out.
1,Dissapointment,To predictable. I could have written a much better script. The acting wasn't bad though. All four people that watched this with us had the same opinion.
5,my father the hero,this has been my favorite movie for a long time! love it! i am so glad i ordered this video!
5,Awesome and fast,"I ordered this movie right before christmas and was told that it would come after, but it didnt very fast delivery!!"
3,not bad,"A cute movie of a young girl coming of age. Unfortunately, director Steve Minor exploits young 14 year old actress Katherine Heigl in several scenes. For instance with a close up of her walking in a thong swimsuit at the pool and later while kissing her crush a shot of the wind blowing katherine's skirt up to reveal the teen in a pair of grey thong panties. Parents be advised."
3,Nothing Heroic,"My Father The Hero is a light comedy that has a few laughs and nothing more. The entire plot is rather corny and over done a bit, but it's stomach able.Gerard Depardieu is hysterically funny as the father who has no idea what is going on. He is trying to protect his 14 year old daughter from ""growing up"", but what he doesn't know is that she already is (appearances anyway). He has a real comic sense and vulnerability.The young girl becomes extremely annoying as the movie progresses, which is probably what turned me off a little bit. Steve Minor, the director, did a good job of creating a fun atmosphere though.My Father The Hero is in no way a great movie, but it is okay for casual viewing and a couple of belly laughs. 3 Stars"
1,"4 1/2 Stars, Really???","The highlight of this movie was hidden between Katherine Heigl buttcheeks, and it went downhill from there (if that's possible). The writing was non existent, uninspired sets, the acting amateurish at best. Gerard, how you got hoodwinked into this is beyond a sane person's comprehension."
2,My Father The Hero,I thought it was a cute story line but it got slow and boring in several spots. Not as funny as it claims to be.
2,I Didn't Care for This Movie,"I purchased this movie for my daughter. My friend recommended it; she said it was one of her favorite movies in high school (many moons ago). I've only caught bits and pieces of it, but in short, Katherine Heigl goes on vacation with her father, Gerard Depardieu, and she leads everyone at the vacation resort to believe that her Dad is her lover, in order to catch the attention of a young and handsome hottie at the resort. Katherine Heigl's character is also a compulsive liar in the movie; it doesn't seem to bother her that everyone at the resort thinks her Dad is a pervert (because they think they are a couple). My daughter likes this movie and asks to watch it frequently, but I'm not very fond of it."
1,awful,Have got the VHS broken and spent an hour to glue the tape to a reel to be able to play it.Complained to seller about it. He did respond (I give him that) with an apology and a kind request to remove my negative review; promised to replace defected item. I was touched and indeed removed my negative re-view.. never heard from a seller since..
2,Come on people...,These guys aren't breaking any kind of ground with this typical story of girl-meets-guy and then problems ensue. It's only redeeming quality was GÃ©rard Depardieu who has his share of moments which is why this movie gets two stars instead of one.
5,What a hero!,"This movie is definitely one of the best movies that I have seen in a long time. It tells anout a young girl who feels that her father is growing away from her and will have children and consecuently forget about her. This movie is full of fun, love and drama."
5,My Father The Hero...funniest movie ever!!,This is the funniest video ever!! A must see for all those who have teenagers...in fact a funny video for everyone!!! A MUST see!!
2,Real dumb,If a Martian came to earth and watched this movie they would think all woman are bitchs and jerks. Miss this one
4,Thank Heaven For Little Girls,"(3.5/5 stars) Gerard Depardieu is Andre, the father who is so desperate to have his daughter, Nicole, back as his little girl again that he plays along when she pretends he is her lover in order to make the guy she likes jealous. Very cute movie, with some funny moments as initially everyone except Depardieu knows about Nicole's little ploys. Katherine Heigl is a good choice for Nicole, a teenager embarrassed by her father and anxious to make her summer vacation memorable. Not exactly thought provoking material, but pleasant and enjoyable all around. Sure to please its intended audience, based on other reviews here. Maurice Chevalier would be glad."
4,This is a good movie..,Its been a long time since i watched this movie its a good movie funny and crazy you gotta see it..
5,Welcome Home,"Jim has written a fine book that will give any one reading it a sense of what war means to each that answer the call to Duty, it is a call that will last a lifetime! I salute Jim for having given his time again for us to learn about a world we are ignorant of. This book brings up front and center the effects of war on the ones we Love. Thank you Jim."
3,A Bizarre Look into Mora's Mind,"This ""movie"" is a bizarre collage of home movies, stock footage, interviews, and some extremely wild allegations that all center around UFOs. It's hard to get past the beginning where the home movies are the most prevalent, but once you get past that and the interviews start, that's when the fun for me began. I really hope that the people Mora interviewed were actors because it's just too disturbing to think I live and work next to them.What's of equal interest to me is to see a real glimpse into Mora's way of thinking. The things he puts in the film, either because he believes them or he was doing it for fun, really tells us a lot about the man and his thinking process. In this case, that may be too much for many people, but I found it to be a fun ride."
1,"Utter trash, a worthless waste of time",An extremely juvenile mockumentary advertised as much more. Nothing of any quality or professional effort to view here. Maybe it cold be used by our present White House for learning purposes to further their current Fox News/two-bit propaganda machine.
5,Non playing organ music lover,Anthony Newman makes Bach exciting.He may not satify the purest but I never get bored listing to Anthony playing Bach.I love the use of lots of reed pipes.I think I probably have every Bach cd and record that Anthony Newman has made.I have over 1000 organ cds and records and Newman is definitely my favorite Bach player.
4,The dragon really gets to sleep!,"A quick read, and a pleasant one. No abstruse concept, all is there, simply explained and easy to experiment with.Mental tricks to make your diet (not one in specific, you won't find dietary advice here) easy and pleasant to follow, to stop the craving and the feeling of deprivation. You will enjoy dieting!you surely don't believe. Neither did I. The fact is... it works, right from the start. I'm the first to be amazed!"
3,Booooooo-bah!,"My daughter loves the show and I got them on sale for $10 otherwise would not have bought them, they are super cute and well made but the dancing and music is too short, there is a try me button on the hand but the real button is on the feet that plays longer and different songs and dances but she got so used to the try me button that that is all she uses."
2,Volume control...,"Both my children, ages 2 and 3, love the television show. We thought that this would be a good idea as a birthday present. However, I wish they had some kind of a volume control...they are pretty loud. Both my kids get a kick out of it for about 5 min. and then move on to the next toy. One of the DVD's or VHS cassetts would have been a better buy."
1,Horrible,"The toy was broken, dirty, scratch up all over the face, and grimy. I threw it away right away. It's in the trash."
3,a little disapointed..,"I couldnt find these things anywhere!! My sister-in-law finally found one at a consignment shop for $2.00!! My 1 yr old son loooves this! We saw it at a friends house, and he was hooked! I am dissapointed that the music isnt long at all, and there are no lights at all..I also was confused with the demo. button? But as the previous reviews said, when you push the foot, it last longer...but other than that, my son loves this crazy thing!!"
4,Baby gets a kick out of it!!!!,"We ran across this little marvel while shopping a few weeks ago. When I started the demo on the little purple one my 3 month old daughter's face lit up and she couldn't stop laughing. Every time I made it move she had the same reaction. We were in the store playing with them for about 10 minutes. She seemed to like the Orange and Purple ones the best for some reason. She loves to grab and touch the fur. She really gets a kick out of her dancing Boohpah. I honestly had no idea what a Boohpah was until today when I happened to stumble across it while flipping through the channels.All in all its a cute toy. Not much educational value for children over 12 months, but fun and entertaining, nonetheless. For babies it does provide touch, visual, and sound stimulation."
1,boobahs stink!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"boobahs are a wasted piece of plastic.you should not buy this pathetic toy!!!!!it is loud,annoying and dumb.no affence or anything,but if you buy this toy you have lost your mind!!!spend your money on something important,not this pink piece of junk.boobahs are ugly too.it will give your children nightmares! please please PLEASE dont buy this pink junk!!!!!!!"
2,Run don't walk,Is this thing supposed to fart? Gross and stupid with no educational value what so ever. It's hard enough trying to keep kids away from potty humor without their TOYS getting in on the act. What a huge waste of money!
4,Comfort fit,I will be purchasing a second pair of these because they are the most comfortable wrap around earbuds I have found. I wear them at the gym and have no problem moving around and keeping sound.
5,"old, outdated but works",just got a cisco aironet 350 PCI card for my server which runs linux. i didnt need to install drivers because since kernel 2.6 the drivers have been included and the neat thing is this card pruportedly from the Cisco page on it works with even kernel 2.2. It is outdated and slow compaired to the N wireless cards of today but if you dont need the fastest connection but have a need for something that works out of the box and is reliable this is your card!
3,"Better than most, but the cheap shortcuts are disappointing","This book illustrates several quite interesting scripts that are barely mentioned in the much more expensive Daniels & Bright, such as the Wolof, Yup'ik, and Nu shu scripts. For all its expense, Daniels & Bright has some poorly written sections, but at least the illustrations are (for the most part) clear. However, as the previous reviewer said, many of the illustrations in the Blackwell Encyclopedia are clipped and pasted and of poor quality. For example, the table illustrating the Yup'ik script has explanatory headings in handwritten cursive German, with letters so small that I can't make them out, and the system is not described in anywhere in the text. So, even if I could distinguish the Yup'ik letters (many of which I can't), I wouldn't know what many of them represented.That said, this is one of the better books for its price."
3,Is this bootleg...?,I think it might be... It's the whole series. All 3 of the DVDs go straight to Japanese with English subtitles once a new episode starts. The subtitles are a little off but close to what they are saying. Those are the only problems I came across. But...the audio and overall quality is very well. It was worth the $10! Not really complaining much since most of anything to do with this series is costly. I love this anime.
4,A must read if you picked up Gateway,"If you read the first book you have to read this one.Again, like the first book, these stories are not ""action"" packed but simply the drama of the lives of the people in the story which keep you interested.Suspense comes from the characters exploring the unknown and the threat and dangers of simply being in space all by themeselves.In addition there is a nice splice of scientific theory thrown in for readers who like that kind of thing. Not everything is just ""assumed"" to be . . . the author actually does a little hypothisizing here and there.Yay! More Heechee technology. 'nuff said!I grew to like the character of Robin Broadhead even more than in the first book.Great imagination and a very easy read."
4,A great SF mystery novel,"I found this sequel to ""Gateway"" to be more fun and a better book. Rather than continue the theme of the first book the veteran Pohl sidesteps and turns out one of the most intriguing SF mystery novels ever. Offhand I can only think of Jack McDevitt's ""Infinity Beach"" as matching ""Beyond the Blue Event Horizon"" in this regard."
4,out of print,Irritating that this book is out of print. Murphy's law in effect (as usual) since I just discovered the first one in the series and want to read on. Thanks alot.
5,How can this be out of print?!,"This is one of the best books I have ever read. It is far superior to ""Gateway."" It pulls you along with each chapter and the mysteries are presented and cleared up in a quick and efficient manner, but by the time he's cleared up one thing about the story, there is another pulling you along. A great read!"
2,A disappointment after Gateway.,I loved Gateway and couldn't wait to read this book. It was such a disappointment I intended to read no further in this series and am none too interested in reading Pohl again at all.
2,Even the Publisher's Review is Inaccurate.,"When I read the book, yes I was frustrated with the inacurracies. But then I looked at it as the experience of 1 person. To me it is more frustrating that the publisher's review is so inaccurate. 5 to 10 years???. The last medical statistics I have read for adult onset showed that a person would expect to live 10 to 35 years depending on other health factors at onset, as well as health care, diet and excercise after onset.We do not need more misinformation spread about this disease. But we do need to listen more to the people who experience it first hand. I have learned much from people with Huntington's who could express themselves as my husband is one who could not mentally evaluate his own Huntington's experience.As the mother of three young adults at risk for Huntington's, I did not find the book helpful in discussing the choice they must make, to test or not to test."
1,Not quite so good,"While this dvd has reasonably good footage, the narration by a person for whom English is a second language detracts from the content. Also within the first few minutes several factual errors were noted by both my daughter and myself.Really you'd be better off looking at wikipedia with a screen reader."
2,"Good footage, TERRIBLE Narration...","This would be a very interesting DVD if it wasn't for the absolutely TERRIBLE narration. The footage is great, lots of interesting clips I've never seen before, but this is the only redeeming quality. The narrator speaks fluent english, however it appears that whoever wrote the script had only been speaking english for 2 weeks whenever this was written. Upon reading the credits, it appears that it was indeed translated, which explains a lot. There are also several factual errors throughout the documentary.Its a shame, because any decent english speaker could have corrected the errors, and made this 1000x better. Its almost humorous, because at times it seems that the narrator is actually struggling to accurately reproduce the incorrect english on the script!! I'm giving it 2 stars for the footage, it loses 3 stars because of the dialogue."
3,Good but not real good,I am a WW II buff and this series is good but has many flaws. The narrator is good and for the most partaccurate but he may be talking of the bombing of Germany by B-17s and B-24s but the viedo is showing B-29'sbombing Japan. There are many flaws similar to this and a novice would not catch it. The series is goodbut not the best if you are looking for accuracy in what you are seeing as the narrator describes the action.
2,Same story new title,If you have read Pretty boy don't bother to buy this one. In this book Kate Kray tells Roy Shaw's story in her own words and 90% of it contens was/is already in pretty boy! Which by the way is a must have!
2,Torchwood :Miracle Day,"I am a big fan of Doctor Who & Torchwood, gut having said that I did not like Miracle Day. I found it contrived, and in some parts dull and boring. It felt as if it had been Americanized. To me, it felt as if it lacked what made it Torchwood in the first place. If you are a died hard fan, I feel as if you will be disappointed. I won't give away any spoilers."
5,GREAT,"great storyline, great actors and evie myles rocks! Nice to see a blend of American and UK actors working together"
3,Worst Score Ever,"Mostly good season (great toward the end), but the music was almost intolerable. Just horrible. It made the shows so much less enjoyable, and while this season wasn't as good as the previous 3, it was still a fun watch. I'd actually give this season 2 1/2 stars if I took the score into consideration. Wish they could edit out the music!!!"
3,This is a skip for Torchwood fans,Saw this on TV. This was not one of the better adventures for the Torchwood people. Cool ideas and a big mystery. The adventure itself was slow and had too much flashback storytelling. The ending was weak for Torchwood.
1,Awful,"Terrible... I mean wow!... this was bad. What a let down, especially considering how excellent ""Children of Earth"" was. As good as ""Children of Earth"" was, that's how bad ""Miracle Day"" is. Everything, from the writing, to the dialogue to the acting was just the pits. This one is definitely a miss."
3,A little disapointed,"I am a Torchwood hardcore fan and I love Jack, Gwen, and Rhys in this season 4 but I must admit I am alittle disapointed with the Americanize style of the production. I fell in love with the show from the first and dearly miss Ianto, Tosh and owen. Even Susie was a great beginning. I will continue to watch the show but I really want to see more of Torchwood Cardiff which puts Captain Jack Harkness, Gwen Cooper and Rhys Williams in the forfront of the show. And the amazing Torchwood time rift delivering us a return appearance of our beloved fallen commrads Ianto, Tosh and Owen would be warmly welcomed. As for the creator Russel T. Davis and the wonderful writers and production people who make this show such a success, Thank you."
1,Buyer Beware of Compatibility Issue,"This isn't a review of the product--because after spending $50, I can NOT view it on my Blu Ray machines. I just purchased it, after the April 3d US release date, so I assumed it would be the US version. And as far as I can tell from the packaging it is--but still it won't play on either of my two Blu Ray machines.The pity is I loved this series when I viewed it on TV, so I guess I'll have to try the DVD version and see if it will play.Bottom line: Buyer Beware of Compatibility Issues. TRULY DISAPPOINTED & UNHAPPY!"
1,"Dark, gloomy, and not worth watching","As much as I adore John Barrowman, I loved Torchwood for its campy humor and the storylines that although dark, had some element of hope in them. Miracle Day was the extension of the hopelessness that ended Children of Earth, and if I could give this zero stars, I would. Some of the scenes (in particular the camps) are very triggering and in my opinion, senseless horror and badly written."
2,What happened?,For a show that reached it's heights with it's last short series this is an extreme disappointment. You can feel the filling of time in this low budget new series.
2,The torch was dropped.,"I give the BBC Torchwood four stars. At least two of those stars fell on it's way to the states. What a stripped down impotent version Maricle Day was! Flat characters, one horse story that was bad (I'd say stupid) on it's own and had a 'who cares' ending that was hard to buy even for a sci-fi fan. Get The Doctor to fix time and get us home to Wales and re-animate Ianto."
3,Not like the Original,"I loved the original Torchwood shows filmed & produced in the UK. So when this came out, I was very excited. Unfortunately, they've ""Americanized"" the show to the point that ruined it for me."
3,Not the best season of Torchwood,"I love Torchwood, but since this was done with American filmmakers, there was something lost in translation so to speak. I miss the old Torchwood."
1,Disapointed. Torchwood should have stayed with BBC,"I am a tremendous fan of Torchwood. Or to put it more aptly, I am a tremendous fan of BBC's Torchwood. I loved the first season, was blown away by the second season, and Children of Earth left me in awe.. I admit, I had a high expectation of Judgment Day. Unfortunately, the story was dismal, the characters (even my beloveds Captain Jack and Gwen) were written to be scattered and not recognizable as their former selves, and it was just outright depressing. I didn't watch the last two episodes."
3,YEAH! MORE TORCHWOOD,"Having a Tourchwood marathon,first season thru Miracle day. In to disk two of Miracle day and it's pretty good but does show the differant feel of American television with British. So far lacking in wildness of season 1 & 2 and no aliens or rift yet that makes Tourchwood.Still miss the old team.John and Eve still have the chemistry going with each other. New people are ok.May post again when it's over."
5,My Head Exploded,"The first series started out slowly and unevenly, but each year became steadily and consistently better. And these last two were the best! It now makes me very sad that this is the last year?"
5,Solid addition to The Torchwood series,"I loved this newest addition to the Torchwood story. I never missed the other Torchwood members because for me Jack and Gwen were always the only interesting characters (and actors) in the series. The other ones didn't seem as charismatic to me. The story was a good one and there were new characters to love and hate. I enjoyed the story thread about Jacks's past and one of his lovers. Not all the questions raised by the main story are quite answered by the end but that was OK with me because they mostly have to do with Jack's immortality, and I think we just have to suspend disbelief with Jack's immortality-- that's the ""fi"" in sci-fi. I hope they continue to add to the Torchwood saga. I'd rate this 4 1/2 stars"
3,Disappointing,"As a fan of previous seasons, I bought this one thinking it would be equally entertaining. Not so.In an effort to mimic shows like ""24"" and ""Lost"", producers went to a new format of continuing time line/story line, rather than discrete episodes. While this worked fairly well for Children of Earth (last season), where the episodes were fewer and action packed, the episodes in Miracle Day are tedious and predictable. The theme of Jack Harkness's many loves and everyone's desire to capture and kill him is beyond tired. And it is far easier to believe in aliens than to believe that Gwen would pick up an automatic handgun, plop ear-protection on her infant-in-arms (no pun intended), and start firing away next to her head.The show was not that old. Producers should not have changed what was still working well. If it is not broken, don't fix it. I was disappointed that I spent $10 on this season and stopped watching midway through episode 6."
2,Not worthy.,"""Miracle Day"" was far below the Torchwood series standard. I was very dissapointed. Please don't continue the ""Miracle Day"" storyline."
3,While I absolutely love this show....,"Miracle Day just didn't have the same feel to it for many reasons. I don't ""do"" spoilers but I will say it is very different than any of the other seasons."
3,Decent show,Miracle Day wasn't a bad show just not what I had come to expect from the Torchwood series. Seasons 1 and 2 are more entertaining.
4,Sad to see this series end,"This final chapter presented the cast with a unique situation. I liked the twists and build up of intensity as the plot unfolded. The characters are complicated and interesting which makes them more real. I'm still not comfortable with the sexual aspect of this series, but it was a significant part of the plot. Of course, Jack was the kingpen as usual. How fun! Too bad there are no plans for future episodes. I'll just have to go back to ""Dr. Who"". Any Dr. Who fan or Torchwood fan would enjoy ""Miracle Day""."
4,Entertaining season,"It was a good, solid season for Torchwood, but not great. The character development between Jack and Gwen felt forced and held back. The plot was interesting, but not spectacular. I enjoyed watching this season, but there wasn't anything in the plot or development that really drove me to finish watching and the pace and style felt too much like America prime time. I do look forward to future seasons."
1,Can't get it to play,Gave it to my husband for Christmas with a new Sony disk blue ray player and can't get it to play
1,Awfull,"Inaccurate - none of the references to Washington DC geography are real. There are no East or West Streets in DC, only Northwest, Northeast etc.Anti-Catholic - ""I used to be Catholic, but now I'm smarter.""Anti-Science - way past alien intervention.Homosexual Porn - woven throughout the episodes...I'm a libertarian, but this is no Dr. Who, but rather an advertisment for the homosexual underworld."
1,A lot to do about nothing,a lot of running .. not believable.. C rateSpend you time and money elseware..theres aways clasic Dr who..:)
3,It's okay,"I enjoyed the first few series of Torchwood. It was a pretty cool series. If you're into Torchwood it's an ok continuation of the series, but I really miss the orginal characters."
3,I miss the crew,"I am a great ""Torchwood"" fan, and this new series is faintly disappointing. I miss the old gang (all of whom died is the previous season) except for Gwen who was not one of my favorites. Captain Jack is very subdued in this series, without his usual vigor and brio. And with all due respect, the plot line of Gwen + husband + infant chasing all over the country is absurd, even in the absurd world of ""Torchwood."" I hope that if there is a following series, they get back to Cardiff and put another team together as appealing as the previous crew to battle absurd monsters. And maybe Gwen should retire and take care of her marriage and her child."
3,"I dunno, it's OK I guess","It's hard to write a review for this because i REALLY wanted to like it - and I just didn't, and mostly it was the writing that didn't work for me. But look at the writers on this - alot of my faves, so how could I NOT like it?Ok, it's not fair to say I didn't like it, but it's reasonable to say I was disappointed and because in the end it didn't FEEL like a Torchwood episode. It felt like an average american TV drama with Capt. Jack and Gwen in it, and what fun is that?"
4,"Almost perfect. Lots of action, too many stereotypes","Lots of plot holes, but that's expected of Torchwood.Lots of bumbling about in the beginning. Takes too long to take off.When it does, it's great.Too many American and ""Wild Woman from Wales"" stereotypes. Love it, though."
4,FYI: Torchwood Adventure Arrives Soon :),"The TV Shows On DVD web site announced on 02/16/2012 that ""Torchwood: Miracle Day"" will be released on 04/03/2012; published by BBC Video; all 10 episodes on four disks; with an SRP of $59.99. I hope that Amazon does eventually take notice & update this entry & ""MY"" pre-order information soon !!!More Eve Miles & Cardiff PLEASE :)"
1,Not Torchwood,"Season 4 should not have been called Torchwood, other than two returning actors there is no relationship with previous seasons. The entire season is what should be one episode expanded and draaaaagggggggged out into 10 episodes. Save your time/money."
4,Never Too Late,"Relying on a power trio in the studio - Joe Walsh (g) and Joe Vitale (d) - John Entwistle delivered a amazingly solid effort in this May 1981 release.The nine tracks on the original album found marginal success on the U.S. album chart - stalling at #71 - though it was the highest ranking achieved for an Entwistle solo effort. Included in the CD are four demo songs and one out-take.The majestic title track is the foundation, though Fallen Angel was the song that received the nod for FM airplay. The tongue-in-cheek Talk Dirty, snappy Love is a Heart Attack and the solid beginning with Try Me demonstrate the sweeping scope the trio attempted to cover.Certainly not helped with its release only several months after The Who's Face Dances, it is an underrated album in the solo career of a remarkable bass player for a legendary band."
4,John's attempt at main stream,"Too Late the Hero was John's attempt at creating a main stream record and the results were decent. Fallen Angel received some radio play back at the album's release in 1981 and Try Me and the title track are good songs. With help from Eagles guitarest Joe Walsh, the quality of play on this album is certainly way above average. While, John's writing will never be mistaken for Pete Townshend's, this album is worth a look if you are a Who fan and in the mood for something different."
2,A little stale,I have tried organic cashews from other places like the local store (stop & shop) and normaly they are fresh and crispy. These were stale. At first I though that it was just the first container but to my disappointment they all were like that. I could have gottent a bad batch but non the less...
5,Surprisingly tasted amazing!,"I was not sure how Horny Goat Weed would taste, but to my surprise it tasted amazing, one of the better flavoured teas I have ever had, for the flavour alone it is worth buying."
1,1 Evil band. Parents BECAREFUL.,"the vocals are awful... i have listened to their other albums and it pretty much is the same stuff, they simply can't get heavyand fast with their material.all of their vocalists are not clean but rather rough and scratchy; they all sing like cookie monster. i have seen infernus without corpsepaint and quite frankly the man is ugly. twilight of the idols is just a cool title for there album/cd but this band stinks. they travel to latin american countries for many of there concerts because they can't get an american tour. Conclusion, you are better off going to Karaoke night at the local club as compared to seeing these negative satanist nazi bozos trying to lure your son or daughter in into their world of hell, of the devil. the members are evil satanists. PARENTS DON'T LET YOUR CHILDREN LISTEN TO THIS GARBAGE."
3,Nothing new here,"This album is well-executed, but adds nothing new to the already very large selection of black metal CD's out there. True, it's not the purest black metal, but even in its black-metal-meets-thrash hybridity, it is not unique. This album is not a waste of money; it's just not the best use of it. If you want something heavy and blackened, pick up Behemoth, or better yet, Emperor's classic Anthem to the Welkin at Dusk--still the best black metal album ever made."
5,Best explanation of ancient Cambodian society,"There are many superb books on Khmer art. This book looks at what life was like in the society that created the art and built ther stupendous temples. It necessarily relies heavily on the one surviving (YÃ¼an-dynasty Chinese) account by a visitor to the Khmer Empire after its peak, but also draws on French archaeology and the author's considerable comparative knowledge of societies and religions. The book is succinct, readable, reasonably priced; although not an art book, it has interesting line drawings and photographs. It also has a comprehensive bibliography."
5,Awesome reference for both ends of the spectrum,"If you're like me, then you are interested in Ayn Rand's philosophy, but not a full-blown Objectivist. This book presents a wide array of commentary by Ayn Rand for hundreds of different topics. It should be known that you can view all the material in this book (with certain exceptions) at [...]for free (and legally). I got this book so I could read the entries while I wasn't on the computer.The main thing that is wrong with this book is that it contains commentary from a jackass named Leonard Peikhoff, the founder of the Ayn Rand Institute. He has been known to be an idiot and deviate from original, Objectivist philosophy. Other than that, this book is fantastic!"
2,[trite] philosopher but good essayist,"I have found that the one thing most of Rand's followers have in common is their ignorance of any philosophy that isn't hers. Rand was not original. Every one of her ideas was said by other philosophers many times before. Reading Rand, you realize that she is ignorant about this fact. A few graduate courses in the history of philosophy would have humbled her as all she did was to re-invent the wheel. It must come as a shock to her followers when they read the truly great philosophers and find out that Rand was unoriginal - and a lightweight.What Rand was, though, was a good writer. Her essays show her ability to make philosophy understandable. She was a lively writer. It is too bad that she couldn't be happy with just being a philosophical popularizer (being to philosophy what Sagan and Asimov were to science)."
5,Ayn Rand Lexicon,"This is a valuable reference for Miss Rand's thoughts on many subjects and issues we deal with today, from abortion to terrorism, the economy, and more. I have it on my Kindle so it is always at my fingertips. The entries are alphabetical, with references to the book or article it was taken from, for further reading."
5,The ultimate resource,A guide to finding definitions in Objectivism the philosophy of Ayn Rand.I refer to it often. Thanks for a great volume.
2,not a good starting place,"I started reading this book, but it is about as interesting or informative as a dictionary or encyclopedia.Because I didn't have a full view of what Ayn Rand was defining, it was too disjointed to make much sense to me.However, that is more because I have just started reading her writings than because the book has no value.It has a lot of value, but not without understanding/knowing what each item is within the Philosophy of Objectivism. As I progress through her other writings, this book becomes a valuable aid, but I wouldn't recommend it for a stand alone volume."
3,"As with any philosophy, one must be critical","Ayn Rand does offer many interesting points in her writings (which this volume sums up). However,though to any reasonable person objective truth does exist (naturally only an idiot would claim that gravity exists only in our minds) morality and other aspects of the human condition exist solely in the mind. Good, evil, love, hate, spirit all are cultural constructs . . . objective morality is a contradiction in terms. Though Ms Rand has added much to 20th century philosophy, and is (in my mind) severely underrated in established philosophical circles, as well as overrated in her followers'her philosophy (as with any other)has its good points, but cannot, in its entirety, stand up to critical thought . . . and reason."
1,erects straw men,i was surprised at ayn rands ignorance at many philosophersnietzche is described as a primitive poet who replaced reason with the primitive idea of willany seroius look to nietzche will show this to be false and recongize him as one of earliest depth pyschologists.rand also makes a straw man of out of socialism describing it as all individuals sacrificing themselves for the govermentalthough some socialists hold that view most aim at redistributing society to each individual the greatest possiblity of paths.ayn rand is at heart a pseodo philosopher with economic concepts of a 10 year old.any objectivists wonder why ayn rand is absent in university teachings or recongized as anything.
1,Telling omissions indeed,"The omission of references on family and childrearing in this volume is indeed telling - especially since a substantial section on 'abortion' is included (wherein she makes several *negative* comments on parenthood).Rand was not interested in parenthood - in fact she thought it was such a tremendous inconvenience that she defended the 'right' of women to destroy their unborn children entirely at will in order to avoid such inconvenience. Was there any other subject on which she thought whim was paramount and responsibility for one's actions could be evaded at the cost of a life? Considering her personal history, is it entirely unreasonable to suspect she may have been rationalising away some guilt on this topic?"
1,Interesting in its omissions,"Open this volume of topical excerpts from the writings of Ayn Rand and read the passages under the headings Family, Parenthood, Children, and Childrearing.. . . Oooooops! There aren't any.Tell you anything?"
5,Another Chris Bangs Wonder,"If Chris Bangs has anything to do with it, you know it's off the chain! Ghetto Life has a mainstream, fusion, acid jazz mix. Astral Space is mellow then funky then mellow then funky. Righteous is downright smooth. Inner Sense is soulful. This CD has it all. Why it is still a secret is beyond me. Glad I know about it, though. Also check out other Chris Bangs wonders: Soundscape UK, Yada Yada, Sambada, Mr. Electric Triangle."
5,"Humour, romance, and action..Mackenzie's Pleasure has it all",I absolutely love Zane Mackenzie's character. I hope there's more novels to follow this one. I haven't read the other books by Linda Howard but I'll definitely search out for them. This novel is not to be missed!
1,One virgin is enough,"Linda Howard loves to minimize her female characters into nothing more then sex objects. All of her female main characters are virgins. Quite frankly I am sick of reading about how super important that really is. All of her female characters make love for the first time like insatiable beasts ignoring their physical response to having been made love to for the first time. These characters are so fake and I am really getting sick of them. This novel really hit the bottom because her virgin girls theme I have just described to you, that has been a consistent theme in all of her other books in the Mackenzie line repeated the same ridiculous line. Why can't someone write about a beautiful woman who isn't a virgin and who really does enjoy sex for sex...without having to write an erotica?"
2,Old-School Romance And Very Outdated,"I bought this book because it was by Linda Howard, whom I enjoy in her current novels, but this one was awful. As soon as the main character (SPOILER ALERT) was aroused by the kidnap victim whom he found lying naked, bound and brutalized, I knew I was in trouble. I realize romance novels have changed in the years since this book was written, but still ... The only bright spot was the family of the main character, the MacKenzie clan. I think I'd like to know them.The Beverly Barton story wasn't better. This story was cliched to the extreme (single woman won't tell the father of her child that he IS the father of the child for some ridiculous reason) and the deception goes on and on and on well past when a reasonable person would give up on the lie.I was very disappointed."
5,Lucid,"This was a great book...one you couldn't nor wanted to put down, but didn't want it to end, either. An amazing first book for Christina Evans. I have always wanted to write a book myself and she has inspired me to get busy on it. I can't wait until her next one!"
3,Prada Bag (maybe),"There are several things which are making it difficult to determine whether it is a real prada bag. I would hope it is given the price because I would never pay that much for a fake, but one of the tell-tale signs that a prada bag is real is that the hardware on the bag is engraved with the word Prada. Despite several metallic hoops, not one of them contains the word Prada. It also has some imperfections on the bag. Certificate of Authenticity is included but I have no idea where to confirm that this Certificate is real. Its hard for me to comment on whether I received an authentic Prada and what I think of the bag as I still cannot confirm that the bag I received was authentic and am faced with the possibility that I paid a lot of money for a fake. I called Prada in NY and they could not direct me to where anyone can check if the bag they purchased is authentic. I am most disappointed and need to find a way to determine whether the bag I have is real."
4,Lovers & Dreamers,I had already read the series but did not recognize it by the title on the books. This book had all three books of the triology in one. I will keep for reading 5 years from now.
1,No preparation here--just a high price tag,"This book is a real disappointment. It offers no discussion or preparatory materials for the FE exam, just a selection of problems from other books by the same publisher. The CDs appear to be repeats of the same problems in the book. No index at all. Many typos and error, starting with the table of contents and continuing on nearly every page. Hard to see how this would help anyone prepare for this exam, if you had any questions at all about the material. And if you don't have any questions, why bother to prepare, you know it already!"
5,A truly unique book,"The Nazis took a symbol with a thousand year history, which they really just ruined for the world. The swastika was used by Native Americans, Nordic Peoples, Polish Mountain Dwellers and Hindus, to name just a few. Only the Hindus use it freely nowadays. This book shows the history of the stolen symbol, from the ancient times to usage in pre-Hitler commercials for products so well known as Coca-Cola. Many of the usages are shown, including types of swastikas found in each region of the world. The book does not concentrate on Nazi usage as many do, though illustrations for that time are also plentiful. It's not long so it really isn't a study book, but it does make an interesting read."
2,Sofa cover,this cover does not stay on well. it has to be realliened everytime you sit on it. it has four ties. two in the front and two in the back. it leaves big string bows out where you can see it and it does not attatch to the sofa
5,cd is great,I have many of Steve's cd's and am never disappointed with any of them. Plan to teach the folkgroup many of these.
2,No Greater Glory: Good Addition to your Library,"To describe this book as a must read would be an overstatement. It was readable, interesting and informative. It is a good book to add to your library if you are interested in the subject matter."
4,Great insight and wonderful story,"It is obvious the author spent a good deal of time in Indonesia and is a professional writer. The characters are well-rounded, the city of Jakarta is described in good detail, and the author understands the human mind and all of its conditions as if he is a psychologist or has simply lived a very experience-laden life. The novel weakens towards the end but I was still really entertained. If you want to read another wonderful fiction/thriller that takes place in an exotic Asian locale with interesting characters, read The Opportunists by Yohann de Silva. Here's the link:The Opportunists: A Novel"
4,Le CarrÃ©-like,"""The year of living dangerously"" is the story of a group of foreign journalists (moslty one named Guy Hamilton) in the year of Sukarno's deposition in Indonesia. It is well written and the reader is given SOME of the facts of life in Indonesia back in the sixties.The good part of this book is that it resembles, in pace , thrilling and style, one of John LeCarrÃ©'s spy books.The bad part of this book is that it seems to have no reason at all to exist. The book starts out of nowhere and finishes suddenly. I don't know if that's because the environment of the story is so alien to me, or any other reason, but that's how I felt.Grade 7.1 / 10"
4,Not bad,"Not a bad read at all actually. The hero is a half-Chinese dwarf named Billy. The other characters treat him quite shabbily at times, but things never descend to the level of dwarf tossing. There is lots of atmospheric stuff about how hot and humid it is in Indonesia -- duh! -- which I could have done without. Otherwise, a pretty good read."
1,Not as pictured or described.,"This is really for six minature cake toppers suitable for cupcakes. The description mentions no indication that it is six toppers. The size specified is for the blister packaging of the six items, not the size of the topper. This was to be a topper for one large birthday cake. I will make do since there is no time for me to obtain a suitable single topper."
1,cheap,These little Tinkerbell toppers look too cheap. I was so disappointed in them that I just pitched them in the trash.
3,Loaded with errors!,"I bought this book after having visited several McCormick & Scmick's restaurants, and really loved their food. The recipes are easy to follow, simple to make and are very tasty.The reason for my rating, is that their are HUGE errors throughout the entire book. A few examples: Crab Rangoon recipe calls for yellow cornmeal in the ingredients list but makes no mention of it in the instructions. The recipe for Stuffed Salmon with Crab & Shrimp has no salmon in it! The photo on the facing page shows a stuffed salmon fillet, but the recipe calls for halibut.This book suffers from poor editing. It smacks of being rushed for publication before the editing was completed.This book would be a great addition to any home cooking library, but be prepared to find confusing recipes."
2,too many errors,There are too many errors in this cookbook. For example the Jamaican Rum sauce starts with remove from the heat but at no time does it list when to start the sauce on heat. It seems like there is a step missing from every recipe which is shame because this could have been a really good seafood cook book. Does anyone know who to contact about the missing steps?
4,I have the 2nd edition. Looking forward to try the recipes.,"I have the second edition that I picked up in a thrift shop, new. I had eaten recently at McCormick and Schmick's and enjoyed the food there and was delighted to find their cookbook. After reading through the recipes, they look very straightforward and quick to put together. I am looking forward to trying the recipes and will update my review shortly thereafter. Though I have read the other reviews about errors and I think they addressed some of the errors in this 2nd edition as I looked thru the book to compare with the comments from other reviewers. Other than that, the only small gripe I have with the book is that the pictures in the book seems a bit dated and old looking. They don't bring excitement to the recipe it depicts. However, the pictures on the dust cover are more vibrant and appealing. If they ever do a 3rd edition, I hope they will update the photos in the book too."
3,Too fancy!,Most of the recipes are too fancy for my pocket! Mouth-watering photos! The book was in great condition when I received it.
3,"An average Tanner, based upon the ""Evidence""","Steephen Greeleaf's John Marshall Tanner private eye series is not quite as good as the best of the genre, though some of the stories are of high quality. ""State's Evidence,"" is not among the better ones. The convoluted plot has Tanner spending time investigating a woman's disappearance in the sleazy Bay town of El Gordo on behalf of the local district attorney. The woman is a witness against the town's leading mob figure. The story has a good level of violence, and takes plenty of twists and turns, but unfortunately becomes a bit too complex for its own good. Tanner makes a good P.I. He's fearless, tough talking, lonely and just a touch cynical. He's just not given first rate material to work with during this particular outing. If you are new to the Tanner series, I'd recommend ""Grave Erros,"" or ""Past Tense"" instead."
1,"Let me see, which world is this?","This not a story of something happening, or of people (or Spirits) doing something, but of characters standing around postulating. (Very British, I guess.) When you hear the terms the ages of Mouldwrap and Witspell you think Harry Potter Universe. But you're wrong. When you get to the part where Plato is listing his definitions, you think this will get better, it's a set up, like Douglas Adams in the Hitchhiker Books, preparing to hit you with strings of belly laughs. Wrong, some people might think Ackroyd is funny or a wit. No, he's not. Plato's world seems to be built of elements scoured from Asimov's Nightfall and Brin's The Practice Effect. If this is British satire, well then, back to Monty Python."
4,"A brisk, funny, thoughtful read, but not perfect","The book is witty, funny, entertaining (for the most part) a bit thought provoking, philosophical, and overall pretty fun to read. It can be easily read in one or two sittings, such as on a plane or in an afternoon."
2,Lighthearted satire,"What appears ostensibly as a thinking man's satire of civilisation in the distamt future (in which humanity has evolved to the level of being able to occupy two planes in space at the same time) turns out to be a bland and forgettable combination of broad jokes and tepid puns. Though the satire is quite lighthearted (poking fun at such figures as Charles Dickens, the author of ""Origin of Species"" and Sigmund ""Fraud"") this is an inevitably forgettable novel, also let down by its pamphlet-size length."
3,Past Perfect errors,"There are past perfect errors in this text. Buyers beware. I need ten more words to make the minimum but all you need to know is in the first sentence. Buy this grammar text if you want but be aware that authors Page and Gras do not know what the past perfect is. It's an important, useful tense and you will need it if you want to speak and write English correctly."
4,square dance,I teach quilting classes for Irvine Valley Community College and found this book for my new fall semester class. I ordered 7 books today and some students are ordering their copies from Amazon. It is a fun project and even beginners can make it. We were able to find a templet to help with the cutting. I recommend this for a fun class.
5,A staple in my gym bag,I use this 5 days per week with my HRM. Bought it after I started to lose HRM signal. I do sweat a lot but am a bit hairy on the chest. Since I started using the Spectra Gel I have not lost a beat. Very easy to apply (I use about a large gum drop on each of the 2 sensors) and easy to clean up. No odor or residue. Great price for such a large amount. Just ordered my 2nd tube. First one is almost out but has been used 5 days per week since the end of August 2010 - at least 6 - 7 months of supply. Very happy with all aspects of the product. Highly recommended.
5,Best gel Ever!,"I had bought the sport elec belt and I ran out of the sport elec cream, so searched to buy the sport elect cream and that thing was expensive!, I mean it was comimg from somewhere in Europe. I logged in to amazon and I thats where I saw the spectra 360 elec gel, I was having second thoughts about it, but after reading the reviews on it,I said what the heck I went for it and bought. Let me tell you I don't regret it! Honestly it works better than the actual sport elect cream that came with the belt.I am 100% satisfied with this product and I Extremely recommend it!"
4,Serves its purpose,Works with all electrodes including belts and TENS units. Does exactly as it is designed to do. Nothing much to say but I will buy again when the need arises.
5,Great,"Works as described, I would highly recommend this product to anyone using the slender tone. It really increased the power"
5,Excellent PRice,"I haven't used it yet, but it is a great price for the size. I doubt I'll have any problems."
4,Useful for heart rate monitors,"I recommend this electrode gel for anyone purchasing a heart rate monitor (HRM), especially if your aerobic exercise is moderate and you don't perspire enough to ensure good contact with the HRM pads. It is nongreasy with no cleanup necessary. Using this gel my Timex HRM picks up my pulse quickly, even while resting. Only a small dab on each HRM pad is required. One tube should last a year."
5,Works great,I put it on my heart rate monitor before I workout each day and it works great - no more lost signal!
5,Use with Polar F4 heart monitor,"Works great and is a lot easier than wetting the band prior to use. Didn't see anywhere on the Polar web site where this was recommended for use with this product, but it WILL work."
4,great,Love the product. great for when I forget to put on the chest strap and don't have running water. Large size will last me for a while.
4,It works,"It works as advertised but can get messy. They should offer a smaller tube, and maybe they do. But then water works also."
3,Huge Tube,"Over size for convenient use. My workouts are in environments where I sweat, so a connection is not a problem. On a very dry day, I moved the chest band and used a little spit -- that worked. Probably will use as a lube in work shop -- replacing an empty KY."
3,Does not improve HRM usage,I bought this product because I had heard that buying electrode gel could help with connectivity on Heart Rate Monitors. My HRM had not been connecting very well and I was hoping this would be a quick fix as opposed to buying a brand new HRM. Unfortunately it did not work. This does not speak to the quality of the product but more so my faulty heart rate monitor.
3,It didn't work as I hoped,"I was having problems with my Timex heart monitor watch (the heart rate was always much under what would be a reasonable rate for somemone who is runnig). Then, I hoped the product solved that, but it didn't. I can't blame it on the product, so I will rate it 3 stars."
4,Not sure how to use it?,I ordered this- as most of the reviews started that they ordered this with the leads and TENS unit. I am not really sure how to use it- as the bottle does not have any directions on it. So I really cannot write a fair review. It would be nice if they gave you info on how to use it.
3,shocking results.,Got it for the Ab belt. Works ok. There is enough in this tube to last you years. Good deal.
4,Great product,Great product have used for many years. It is a steal at this price. I recommend it you will be totally satisfied.
5,Conductive,I will recommend this product because of the following:1. Cheaper2. Conductive3. Can easily be removedI've been using this for my Timex heart rate monitor transmitter strap. It provides good conduction of the electrode from my body(heart)and the electrode sticks on my body which last for over 35 minutes of doing cardio exercise in my elliptical machine.
1,CHUC,I recieved gel for ultrasounds? LOL good thing it was cheap but I was pissed. But it still works though so thats the good thing.
4,Works as well as expected,"It works just fine, but the product it was to be used with failed miserably. I would not either recommend it or discourage it."
5,Does what it's supposed to do,"I'm using this with my Garmin Forerunner and it works great. Without it I found i didn't get a solid heart rate signal until after I got a bit sweaty - just a drop of this fixes it. I did find the nozzle on the tube to be a little wide for the quantities i'd want to dispense, but it's easy to spread it around on the heart monitor strap with your finger.It has a very slight stickiness, but it washes off really easily and doesn't seem to stain anything."
5,Great product!,Love this stuff! It keeps my HRM going & keeps it in place. Not messy at all & don't have to use much at all! This will last for a long time!
5,Works exactly as its meant to,I bought this to use with a heart rate monitor and it works perfectly. It's a large tube and a little goes a long way. Have not had any connection issues with my HR monitor since I started using it for running.
5,Helen Baylor - Live Experience,The artist is my favorite Gospel singer and her presentation of all of her songs and testimony of her deliverence from drugs and alcohol has helped me to know that she is truly sincere in her belief in God. She puts herself into every word she says and sings - no one measures up to her!
4,Sold Out,"I have heard this CD many times; but I must admit I enjoyed watching it maybe even more than listening to it. I can't say that about all Christian Music Videos. Probably the highlight of the video is when Helen Baylor shares her story. She is a living testimony and it was a pleasure to listen to her story and see as a testimony how Jesus Christ has made a difference in her life and that she is ""Sold Out"" to Him; not her own anymore.Perhaps this is what makes this DVD truly special, is that in this portion of the video is ministry on a different level."
3,Helen Baylor 1st Ever DVD ...,im a fan of Helen baylor...i love her songs it really inspires me alot to walk with Jesus....very uplifting and soul....what am i dissapointed about this DVD is the sound...its not in 5.1 channel. nor a pcm..sounds too low...you have to adjust volume to the max for you to hear it loudly....but the picture is vividly clear!!!buy this DVd..!!!
3,Addictions and Native Americans Review,this is a good native american book and should be read by many people
5,Music to your ears,"Hey people I am a big fun of Reamonn and I wish they could come to USA for example, the cd ""Beutifull Sky"" is very good; however I believe that the 1st album \Tuesday\ is even better and I highly recommend it to everyone. It is a different music than many of you are used hearing in this country but is well worth of listening to it."
1,Not Enough Information,Lots of pictures of purses from 1940s to present. Almost nothing before that period. A lot of plastic and not the good kind.
2,I was disappointed with this book,"This book has a folksy feel and lots of color pictures of the author's collection. However, I found practically no information about the manufacturers, materials used, how the purses were dated, or anything else particularly useful. Just pretty pictures and personal anecdotes. If you are looking for a guide to vintage purses, this book does not fill the bill."
5,VARIETY OF ANTIQUE PURSES,"I WAS IMPRESSED WITH THE PREVIEW OF EACH COMPANY THAT PRODUCED THE PURSES AND THE OLD PRINTS USED BY ARTISTS THAT MAY NOT BE LABELED, SO YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO MATCH AN OLD PURSE THAT IS NOT MARKED. THERE IS A LOT OF INFORMATION AND PICTURES IN THE BOOK. AGAIN I WISH IT COULD REFER YOU TO BOOKS, STORES OR PEOPLE WHO REPAIR DAMAGED PURSES OR A LEAST GIVE A CONTACT ON WHERE YOU CAN FIND PARTS YOU NEED."
4,Craptastic!,It is chincier than I thought it would be but it got to me in time and at a very resonable price.
3,The Book Harps on the Same String,"The author tries to explain each concept using unnecessarily too many examples. Also, the book seriously suffers from wordiness. Author's writing style obscures his intended message a lot of times. He writes about each concept for ""pages"", and each of these concepts boils down to two or three sentences in the end. He should treat readers' time with a bit more respect!"
4,Groovy fantoozi stuff from Australia!,"This Ministry of Sound compilation is mixed by two of Australian's finest, Mark Dynamix and Groove Terminator, who got his start in good ol' Adelaide! Some of my fave tracks are on here, from artists like the Chemical Brothers (Music: Response), ATB (Killer 2000) GT (The Sunshine Song) and Lost'n'Alive (Everything I Play.) This CD came out to coincide with the Club Nation tour, which I unfortunatly missed. So this comp is the next best thing! So click away and add it to your Minsitry of Sound collection, it makes a very nice valued addition."
5,Great memories of Eek! the Cat,"Eek! the Cat was a cartoon I fondly remember watching after school on my back porch and loving every minute. I think some of the more intellectual throwbacks went over my head at the time, but I remember loving Eek himself and how great he was and helpful he wanted to be. I loved his adventures and just couldn't get enough of him. I remember seeing a stuffed animal of him in a toy store and I bought it immediately!I would love to see this on DVD, though I know that is not meant to be. Even as an adult I think I can still get much fun from watching this cartoon. A part of my childhood, I'd like the chance for a bit of nostalgia. It reminds me of a time when cartoons seemed to mean something and wanted to teach the audience something--not always, but surely more than they do now. I think cartoons of the 80's had way more substance than the computer churn outs we get today. I love you Eek!"
1,Wrong Item sent,"The wrong item was sent, black/black men's size 11. No big deal on the color but way off on the size so they cannot be used. If/When I return the item, they will refund only the product price, not the shipping either direction!! I would reccommend that you never buy from AmericaRX."
2,Bottle leaked in poor packaging,This oil was recommended by my leather bag manufacturer. The packaging was so poor that a quarter of the bottle leaked all over. I didn't end up using it because I didn't want to clean up the mess.
1,You can find this much cheaper elsewhere,"This kind of oil works well, but this particular product is WAY WAY WAY overpriced. Here, you're paying 1 dollar per ounce. In a tack shop (horseback riding equipment shop), you can get a 32 ounce bottle for 10 bucks. It's a good product: get it somewhere else."
5,One of the Best Albums... EVER!,"I'm delighted with the balance, the restraint (when necessary), the exquisite phrasing and everything else. Really, this is as close to perfection in piano playing as one can hope.If you are not a Chopin fan (and let's be fair, not everyone is) you will still delight in the Chopin performances simply because of the beauty and power of the interpretations. As for the Debussy? Revelatory. The colors of the Debussy and all the shades Moravec shows us is breathtaking.You'll want to get a few copies of this. One for yourself and one for everyone you care for."
3,Debussy A La Moravec,"Short and to the point.Hey go ahead and ignore my opinion, go buy this and forget Roge.But after you buy this cd, then buy Roge, and you tell me which you prefer.I even prefer Michelangeli(4 stars) over Moravec."
4,a good bet,"My 4 year old is a huge Richard Scarry fan, so despite the limited info in Amazon's description, I took a chance and ordered this. The manufacturer's recommended age for this game is 4 - 8. It's a gift so we haven't opened and played with it yet, but it looks to have great educational value and is ideal for an avid Richard Scarry fan. According to the box, six different game boards vary in difficulty from matching to counting, adding, and subtracting. Also includes dice and cards and can be played a variety of ways."
5,The essential manual for Windows Server 2003,"If you are comparing Manisi's and this one, this is the one you should get. It is more detailed and frankly a better manual. As far as this not having anything on NLB and clustering, there's two chapters: Planning for HA and Deploying Server Clusters, together about 80 pages. Minasi's book has 5 pages on NLB that's it. Get this book, you won't regret it."
4,Very Good Book,I recently bought a copy of this book. I saw it on the desk of a colleague at work and decided to have a look. It is really great and I also like the writing style of Stanek. My only regret is that I didn't purchase it earlier. This would have saved me considerably time and effort in researching several administration problems that may crop up from time to time.
5,Microsoft Windows Server 2003 Inside Out,I found that this book contained information and detail that exceeded what would turn up in a typical web search. The book devotes around 200 pages just to AD. I have several books and this one actually gets used!
1,Not for an real administrator,Show me the pages wich describe how to replace a primary domain controller. Or how to set up RIS the right way with all kind of differend hardware. The info the book gives is not inside out information thats why the 1 star. If you want to get an overview of server 2003 this book could work for you. But dont expect to learn daily stuff work.
1,Don't Buy This Thinking It's Original LP-It's Big Brass,"Now I like Past Perfect as a cheapo re-issue label when they do comps that you know are comps.There sound quality is OK (not like God awful Collectibles-they should be put out of business).But here they took the well regarded album ""Big Brass"" on Candid WHICH IS A 4 OR 5 STAR ALBUM(read my review of that to get a take-great LP).But let's have some truth in labeling here and not confuse the customer/completest who thinks it's something new in the discography.On other hand it's cheap and sound OK.CheerioChazz"
5,"sturdy, love them","these are very sturdy, will last forever. i only wish they had more measurement sizes. they are cute and i am pleased with my purchase."
2,Terrible remake of Les Amities Particulars,"I have seen many rave reviews of this film which mystify me.When I excitedly sat down to watch this film after seeing so many rave reviews I was shocked see what I was actually seeing was a rather poor disguised remake of the 1963 French film ""Les Amities Particulars"".Compared to the 1963 film with the fantastic child actor Didier Haudepin the boy actors are flat and compared to Didier Haudepin's role in the 1963 film Haudepin blows the combined acting efforts of all concerned out of the water in his preformance.The only thing I can guess is that all the people out there giving this film 4 or 5 stars is they have never seen the orginal 5 star film ""This Special Friendship"" (Les Amities Particulars)-as a remake,this film bombs rather sadly in comparison in acting,tension,soundtrack and most notably the photography as if one compares the orginal [...] b&w; to the modern color version one sees the the B&w; was better suited for the story."
1,Save Your Money -- Nothing On International Futures Here,"Well, maybe my heading isn't entirely fair...there are at least a few pages on international futures, but not much more. The title of this book should have been ""The Complete Beginner's Guide To Daytrading"" since 80% of the text is just basics on trading like standard TA indicators, how to find a broker, etc. I got the distinct impression that Mr. Bernstein wrote a chapter or two on international futures, and then his editors flushed it out into an entire book and stuck his name on it. I am returning this thing tomorrow and gettig my money back."
5,Damn Good Funk!,An exceptional album for anyone who loves funky jazzy funk. Great jams and solos over some smooth funky beats. A good mix of jazz licks and varying tempos too. It's damn good funk.
5,Hot Funk,"This is actually the James Taylor Quartet (UK). This was a side project under an unknown name. The JTQ groove is all over this CD and it's a funky jam! This is a hard to find CD, don't hesitate to buy it if it's available. Just do it, you'll be very glad you did so. ** Also ... Check out The New Mastersounds, The Bobby Hughes Experience, Capri, Lettuce, Mickey & the Soul Generation, Topaz, Vinyl, Robert Walter/Robert Walter's 20th Congress and Los Amigos Invisibles. ** You will dig this music HARD!!! Check out Dusty Groove America online. Way cool spot for tunes."
2,"An authentic 1916 film, collectable, video taped to DVD.","This is a classic, first of its kind film. The special effects include some of the FIRST underwater motion film ever made. There is no dialoged sound track, a pianist accompanies the black&white (sometimes brown& white) images while occasional subtitles elude to the drama as it unfolds. The image bobs and weaves like a video camera was held in front of a screen showing the celluloid film to make this into DVD. A tripod would have helped.If you must have any and all submarine movies, or are collecting samples of cutting edge effects before the era of synchronized sound, then this DVD is for you. If you're looking for the ""20,000 Leagues Under the Sea"" where the squid wraps around the sub in full color & sound, then I think the Disney version is the one you want. I'll keep both versions!"
4,Classic Jules Verne,"This version of Jules Verne's classic is unique in so far as it concentrates upon the character of Captain Nemo, providing considerable material on his background, most of which has been neglected in subsequent adaptations. The groundbreaking underwater photography is still amongst the best on film. This print is a little scratched in places, but on the whole it's still an excellent copy. The color tinting effectively sets the atmosphere for each scene, and an appropriate musical score in Dolby Digital Stereo adds tremendously to the viewing experience. I highly recommend this DVD to any connoisseur of early cinema."
4,jules verne fans will love it,"If you are a die hard Jules Verne fan this is a must, however, remember this was made at the dawn of film making, so go in with an open mind. the film maker has taken many liberties with the direction of the original story, also it should be noted this is not as advertised the 1907 version of the film, it the later 1916 version. the earlier one is still unavailable. also this has been remastered from the original, the soundtrack music sounds different the picture quality could have been better, a full restoration should be undertaken on this film."
2,AVERAGE!,This movie is only worth watching if your a fan of the eastsidaz and would like to watch them in action. Tray Dee cant act for sh** and the story line is also weak.
2,Not really that good,"Right yall im a massive massive Snoop Dogg fan and i rented this movie in good faith of it being good but it wasnt the filming was pants and the acting was quite bad too the best bit is when snoop beats up a man in a shop for getting him kicked out of the high school football team, the storyline is hard to understand at first youll have to watch it twice to fully understand it, its an alright film if your completley bored otherwise dont waste your money."
3,it was a little bootleg,"First off, let me say that this movie was not that bad. I know it was an idependent film so I am not going to compare it to the GodFather. The plot was simple, but what do you honestly expect from a rapper? I'm sure this was the first movie for the entire cast. The cinematography was definately low budget, but it was a low budget movie. Making movies is an art and Snoop is still practicing that art. Some parts seemed a little far fetched, but so is Stallone, Arnold, and Bruce killing 20 men all by themselves. It is strictly entertainment. This is good enough to rent on a rainy day, but not good enough to have in your collection unless you are the ultimate Snoop Dogg fan. It kept me from being bored for 90 minutes."
2,"HA HA HA HA HA, WHAT A JOKE!","BEFORE YA EVEN PICK THIS MOVIE UP, YOU SHOULD ALREADY KNOW THAT THE ACTING IS GONNA BE TERRIBLE AND THE FILMING IS GONNA BE CHEAP. BUT, SOMETIMES, IT'S SO STUPID THAT IT GETS FUNNY. BEFORE HE RETIRES FROM ''THE GAME'', A GANG LORD [SNOOP DOGG] DOES ONE FINAL JOB. BUT, HIS HOMEBOY [TRAY DEEE] SETS HIM UP FOR A MURDER HE DIDN'T COMMIT. WANTING REVENGE, HE BREAKS OUT OF JAIL AND GOES ON THE HUNT FOR THE MAN WHO SENT HIM TO JAIL AND KIDNAPPED HIS GIRL. STUPID BUT UNDENIABLY FUNNY. I WAS GON GIVE THIS MOVIE 1 STAR AT FIRST, BUT AFTER REALIZING HOW FUNNY IT WAS, I DECIDED TO RAISE IT BY 1 MORE STAR. THUGS, MOST FANS OF SNOOP DOGG, AND MOST FANS OF GANGSTA MOVIES WILL LIKE THIS. BUT OTHERS NEEDN'T EVEN BOTHER."
1,An Example of the problems with our children today,"This was trash. I am a grown man from South Central LA. To the teens who want this, this was crap anyway and the acting was bad. It wasn't even entertaining. The people who bought it were probably to young to understand it but they liked it anway. I am tired of this senseless garbage being produced. Don't bother with this one. Waste of money."
3,Fun movie,"All I really have to say is that the production of these movies should not be stopped. If you don't like the content or the language or if you just plan don't like it, than just don't buy it. I'm so sick of hearing people wine about the content in movies and music. Maybe I should say it again in case you missed it, IF YOU DON'T LIKE THE MOVIE, DON'T BUY THE MOVIE!"
3,Tha Eastsidaz,Good movie! The chase scene with the police coming over the hill with the German Shepherd Dogs was the best part!
1,A film that is destroying our youth today,"Hello I recently purchased the film ""eastsidaz"" it depicted los angeles gang life, and it is a problem that will never cease, it seems these movies glorify gangs and drugs, and prison. We need to put an end to this production of movies, films, and video games which depict los angeles gang life. The gangs in los angeles are large but most would say they gangs have died 10 years ago. Your children see these films and copy what they see on film. this needs to stop."
3,"not bad but not quite as good as the ""dummies"" book","not a bad study guide. i bought this one and ""mcse windows 98 for dummies"" which i thought was better, more up to date."
4,"Great Book format, easy to understand.",I only used this book to prepare for the exam and passed the first time. I like the exam watch sections but watch out for the errors. Some questions on test are not covered in the material. Good all around study guide for exam 70-98.
3,Not bad. Not great.,"I think I would have to put this book in the category of, ""Pretty Good"". It's better for memorizing facts than actually learning the ins and out of Win98. Between this book and the Win98 Resource Kit I was able to pass the Win98 MCP. My advice to exam takers is to study the Network Client sections very hard. The test is about 90% Netware/NT Client issues and about 10% Win98 issues."
5,A True Look Inside A Man's Head,"""Man and Wife"" by Tony Parsons is a wonderful and enlightening look into the mind of married men everywhere. This sequel to the very well received ""Man and Boy"", is a tremendous picture into the lives of ""the husband, the ex-wife, the new wife, the son and the new stepdaughter. ""Man and Wife"" explores the questions that face every blended family and really tackles the tough questions.The most intriguing part of this book is the fact that it is told from the male perspective and that was really interesting. I loved this amazingly smart, thoughtful and heartfelt journey of a man and his new life.Great book and would make an interesting book club selection. I bet there are tons of families out there with these same questions."
2,Repeat of Man and Boy,"As a stand-alone this book would be okay but if you've read Man and Boy it just seems to fall flat and be a second take at the same themes and situations. It was pretty disappointing specially because by the end one is just irritated with Harry Silver. He makes the same mistakes (almost) and though he eventually sees how immature he is being, it is a bit of a bore for the reader. I did like the male perspective but not enough to have made it worth the time."
4,great insights for steppparents....,"the insights into second marriages & stepparenting were right on target. Also, the caring for the aging parent & loss of a parent - however, you need to overlook Harry's selfishness & immaturity - if you can do that, it's a great read."
5,Such Insight!,"I read Man and Boy and was so excited for the next book. True to form, in Man and Wife, Mr. Parsons continued with his insightful documentation of the emotional turmoil he went through during his divorce. I secretly hoped in his second work, he and ""Gina"" would get back together. This series is so real, I recommended it to a man fighting over custody of his son. It documents with clarity what children of divorce should know about thier parents anguish, making decisions with and without regard to thier children's emotional outcome. It put into words, what causes a man to want to stray and sometimes with horrible outcomes. Such a sensitive author! Bravo!"
4,Like eating peanuts,"This book is like an oversized bag of peanuts. You think you can just eat a few but then you find your hand going back in for more. You can read these concise articles a few at a time or in a long sitting but they always keeps calling you back. For a layperson, the theological explanations alone are worth the time. How else would someone know that suprelapsarians believe people were chosen to be Elect or not even before God created the world? And in the historical realm, how else would we know that Aaron Burr's father was a Presbyterian minister? This book is not only informative but fun.Ron Stockton"
2,Get what you pay for,This unit is a bit of a dissapointment. My bad I went for price. Resetting time temp is not easy or intuitive. Keep the instrcutions handy. The remote sensor which I had about 20 feet away phases in and out. Spend more on a better unit.
4,Has lasted well,"It's been a couple of years since I purchased this and, for the most part, it has worked quite well. Set up was relatively easy and it lasts a long time on a set of batteries. The only part I found annoying is that if you go to add another temperature sensor after you have it set up, then you have to take the batteries out of the indoor unit and all the outdoor sensors."
4,weather station,this product was all that i expected works well. barimetric conditions take a while but expected that. Overall performance excellant in my opinion
4,"It kept me laughing for hours, it even made my Dad laugh.","This is a collection of most of the stories I have read and enjoyed on the net plus many many more. For clean humor about practically anything, this is for you."
5,Louis Nowra does it again!,"The screenplay for this movie was written by one of Australia's greatest contemporary playwrights, namely, Louis Nowra. When it comes to putting Australia on the map, Louis Nowra does it every time! This film has it all, love, misery, and madness...an exceptional film!"
2,Mad at the opera.,"Australia has produced a lot of great movies, large and small, and this ain't one of them. If you're really wanting a good comedy set in a mental institution, check out ""The Dream Team"" instead. If you want a good film from Down Under, there are plenty others to choose from; just pass this one by."
5,****I LOVED COSI****,I love Toni Collette and was watching some of her movies that I missed & this was one of them.It's wonderful!!...I saw Toni in Wild Party on Broadway & already knew she had a great singing voice..but she's sings two songs in this movie acapella(with no musical accompaniment)....that's when you know someone can truely sing!!.....so is there anything this woman can't do??.....Rachel Griffiths is also a major part of the movie & didn't know they made another movie beside Muriel's Wedding!..see the movie it's great
3,THIS IS NOT IT'S TITLE,"THE PICTURE THAT IS SHOWN IS NOT THE SAME AS THE TITLE GIVEN. THE REEL TITLE IS(BRUCE LE'S GREATEST REVENGE) AND IT IS PREATY GOOD MOVIE AT THAT. IT'S ABOUT GOLD MINERS AND THE WORKERS BAD REPUTATION.THEIR ARE DECENT FIGHT SCENES AND A GOOD IMPERSONATION OF BRUCE LEE.SINCERELY, JASON J MEDEIROS"
1,"Not ""The Dragon""",Bruce Le (Bruce Lee's name sake) remakes a familiar story line between a union boss and mistreated workers.
5,GREAT!,"This movie is amazing. It really shows the bond shared between two brothers. It's funny, entertaining, and I've never seen anything like it!"
4,"i got a bad copy, didn't work had to send back",this is a very funny movie I scene it before. It is worth watching. You will laugh your heads off.
2,No me parece una buena opciÃ³n,"Aunque he comprado a Amazon ya dos portÃ¡tiles HP Pavilion y los productos HP generalmente tienen muy buena calidad, yo he tenido mala suerte con esta marca a diferencia de otras marcas que tambiÃ©n he comprado por acÃ¡. Un defecto que le he notado, no solo a las mÃ­as sino a la de algunos amigos, es la fragilidad de su teclado. Algunas teclas terminan desprendiÃ©ndose con el uso con el tiempo. En mi caso ambas portÃ¡tiles terminaron daÃ±Ã¡ndose cuando la tarjeta madre dejÃ³ de funcionar y ninguna durÃ³ mÃ¡s de 2 aÃ±os. El soporte tÃ©cnico de HP tambiÃ©n ha sido terrible y cuando sustituÃ­ la tarjeta madre de una de ellas con un tÃ©cnico personal ya que con HP no se pudo, se volviÃ³ a daÃ±ar al poco tiempo. Luego de esa experiencia no volverÃ© a comprar portÃ¡tiles HP, ahora he preferido Lenovo, Dell o Alienware, las cuales me han salido mucho mejores y mÃ¡s estables."
1,"One ought not ""dis"" an icon, but . . .","This book bored both my husband and myself . . . and we're eclectic readers, hard to turn off once we've committed to a book. Levine's earlier work is good, but IMHO by now success has gone to his head. Take a ""Marriage Enrichment"" course or something, but don't waste your $ on this book."
4,Grief,"I read this book for the first time about ten years ago. I was an atheist then and I'm an atheist now, but I still think that this is a fantastic book - especially for those who ARE spiritual.As an atheist it's a fascinating look into the mind of the faithful and how they reconcile tragedy and god. I also think that I like the god described in this book a lot more than I like the evangelical's god ... anyway. Spiritual or atheist -- read this book."
1,Some will loose hope reading this book!!!,"A friend gave us this book to help us understand,why we have had so many bad things happen to us,even though we are good people. She didn't readit, but only went by the title of the book. Youcould easily loose your faith and hope readingthis book. I don't recommend it at all!!"
2,When Bad Reviews Happen to Intelligent Authors,The book was a disappointment to me because I have a different view of people. I think it was because Mr. Kushner and I define what good people are differently. He does give some insight and writes well. I suggest giving it a read since it has impacted so many others.
3,"""There are better choices to understand the mind of God...""","Dr. Kushner was well-intentioned in his authorship of this book to be sure. However, his basic conclusion is that God is either all-powerful or all-loving. Since bad things happen, God isn't all powerful.The theology is faulty. As Christ was fully God, and still fully human, so God can be loving and powerful without losing either attribute. God's power never works outside His perfect will, and sometimes that will permits evil.A much better book on endurance through adversity is ""With Joseph in the University of Adversity"". This book will answer most questions Kushner poses from a much more conservative and scriptural point of view."
5,a wonderful resource for those who grieve,"A friend gave this book to me and my husband when our son died in 1978. It was so very helpful to us then and we have given it to others over the years. I have also recommended it professionally for clients who are struggling with terrible losses. The book is well written and sincere, by a man of God who also lost a son. and it gives one the opportunity to work along with Rabbi Kushner as he asks the ""Why me?"" questions toward his own conclusions - and perhaps similar conclusions for the reader. Regardless of the reader's conclusions, the process is extremely helpful."
5,When Bad Things Happen to Good People,"This is a wonderful little book for people of any faith. I felt it spoke directly to me. If you note my past record, this is the fourth copy I have purchased as I give them away to people that I know will benefit from it."
5,Life Changing,"I read this book during a time when life around me was going through turmoil. It helped me deal with betrayal by someone close to me, and just reading this stabilized my viewpoint on the situation to where I understood much better and dealt with it sanely.From this man's book, I started taking responsibility for what I had done as well. I continued learning about life and now, 20 years later I can say the information in this book was definitely the turning point."
3,"thoughtful, likeable, but contains wishful-thinking","I warmed to the author of this book and found some of his comments comforting at a difficult time in my life. I found him largely down-to-earth and helpful - for example, when he points out that there's often no point worrying about ""why did this happen to me?"" etc because often there's no particualar reason things happen, they just do.However as a religious man the crux of his problem is how to reconcile this randomness and lack of justice with a supposedly all-loving, all-knowing, all-powerful God. So the author just decides God is NOT all-powerful - he loves us and is upset when we are upset, but can't stop certain things from happenning. He doesn't explain why this should be so, or try to prove it, but just states that must be right as it enables him to go on believing in God. It's certainly one way of looking at things, and coping with life, but not entirely satisfactory to me and is the biggest flaw in a nice book, in my opinion."
5,Immensely Inspiring!,"Very helpful for tough times. I have given this book to so many friends when the you-know-what hits the fan. They always thank me, saying it saved them.-Jacqueline Marcell, Author 'Elder Rage, or Take My Father... Please! How to Survive Caring for Aging Parents', International Speaker on Eldercare & Alzheimer's"
5,The truth will set you free.,"I read this life changing book in the early 1980's after experiencing many setbacks in my own life, our family business was very stressful and on the decline and most importantly my husband's 2 heart attacks at the age of 41 and by-pass surgery thereafter.This book changed my perception of God from a controlling God to a compassionate God.Written after the death of his 13 year old son who had a disease called ""progeria"" rapid aging, Rabbi Kushner shares with us his insights and his relationship with God. This transformation came after much pain, anger, blame and feelings of despair. The familiar words of Job: "" Why me Lord,"" came to him often and after much scrutiny, Rabbi Kushner is convinced that this is not the God that he believed in, God would not take his son from him, God would not punish in such a cruel way. God was and is a compassionate and merciful God.This is Rabbi Kushner's gift to us, the conviction, belief and knowledge that God is a loving God."
5,"Extremely well-written, worth reading time and time again","Not being of the Jewish faith, I still find Kushner's book both insightful and healing. Another reviewer criticized the book for not providing a logical and substantiated answer to the question, ""Why do bad things happen?"". I believe the ""answer"" he provides is simply this - we don't have the answers, and we probably never will. That being said, by wallowing in our own guilt, blaming others, or dwelling on the ""why"", I believe Rabbi Kushner suggests that we tend to forget that there are others suffering that just need our comfort and support - they don't want our answers, just our friendship, as he did with his tragedy. For oneself, don't dwell in anger, or in denial, or in blame, because sometimes things aren't your fault, and they're not God's either - let go, and move on to the healing. If this book helps people get to that stage quicker, then I think its served its purpose."
4,when bad things happen to good people,"I ordered this book because I needed it for my modern belief class. There can be some controversial issues depending how religious you are, but I found the book to be useful on what we see or hear about everyday through the news, media, friends and family. You know what is happening around the world but after reading it, your eyes and mind is opened fully!"
4,when bad things happen to good people,I thought it was difficult for me to follow. A lot deeper than my finite mind could comprehend. I did read it and maybe should reread it.
2,Left me wanting too much more info!!!,"I liked what was being said but.....This has to be the shortest (total playing time)book on tape I have ever purchased! I think more info. could have been recorded. I feel there must be alot that I missed from the book and I have never had that feeling before after listening to a book on tape. I do not expect to get the entire book via spoken word, but from such a well received /critically acclaimed book and based on such a moving &important topic more info should have been there."
1,Author limits God's power,"The author's limited view of God's power to intervene was discouraging to me. As a Christian, I treasure the comfort of knowing Christ and his promises in the New Testament to care for us. As a Jew, the author's religious beliefs limit his opinion to Old Testament teachings. David Jeremiah's book When Your World Falls Apart proved more comforting on the subject."
4,Great discussion book,"Kushner's book makes a great discussion starter because every person has experienced bad things happening to good people. Using his book helps one look at reactions such as anger, guilt, the forever ""why"" questions. I'm currently using the book as a study with a group of Christian women. It is interesting to hear them broaden Kushner's theology with their own Christian beliefs. I am using Philip Yancey's Where is God When it Hurts? to supplement When Bad Things Happen to Good People."
4,When Bad things happen to good people,There are no certain things in life. The book helps put everything in prespective and you understand that everyone sooner or later will have a price to pay. Excelent reading.
5,Extremely helpful and uplifting,"I bought this book nearly 9 years ago after I lost my mother to a devastating illness that September, and my daughter was delivered stillborn a week before my due date in January. My father went on to die from cancer the following September. None of it made sense, and it caused me to question all that I'd believed in.Rabbi Kushner's message -- that things don't ""happen for a reason"" but that God gave us this world and nature and that sometimes bad things just happen, helped me better understand that my mom didn't do anything to cause her illness and my daughter didn't do anything to miss her chance at life. More importantly, the latter (and much more important) part of the message -- that God intervenes in our world by giving us each other -- has helped me live each day since, appreciating life and the gifts I've been given in my family, friends, colleagues and sometimes even strangers. I HIGHLY recommend this book, not only to those who are grieving, but to everyone."
2,Makes a better case for atheism than God.,"I just finished reading this book as I write this. The first half of the book is pretty good, but this rabbi really makes a better case for god not existing than theism. As the book goes on, he starts to contradict himself and his arguments start to turn very very weak. He should have only made this book half as long.Bottom line, if you are atheist and want to maybe convince your friends or family that believing in god is stupid, this might be a good introduction book for them."
5,A MOST fortunate book!!!,"It is unfortunate that while our son was dying of cancer we did not know about this profound book. Our son (age 22) kept asking ""why me?"" and wondered what he had ""done wrong"" to deserve cancer. Kushner's book helped us to deal with his death and gave us the answers to the unanswerabe questions, ""why me, Lord?""I disagree with the Garner, NC reviewer completely. If he claims the book is blasphemous, perhaps he'd better re-read Job and reconsider its meaning. For if God is all powerful, than the conclusion would be that God is also unjust.Our family has reread ""When Bad Things Happen to Good People"" many times. We buy the book by the dozens and give copies to people we know who are suffering (from any cause) and looking for answers.Rabbi Kushner, you have written a most fortunate book!"
5,Fabulous Book,I have read this compelling book three times and will probably read it three more before it is over. ...just an ecceptional work.
3,Makes you think about how you pray,A hard read for me because of comparisons that I could not relate to......the book helped me sort out what I pray for and what is realistic. I view prayer from a different thought process....
4,the unthinkable,"This is an amazing book! I have searched (like many others) to find answers for the most common question of the human condition. Why do bad things happen to good people? This excellent book driven out of a personal quest to find an answer - an answer that challenges orthodox thinking about good and evil, sin and punishment; as well as the very nature of God. Job has so much to teach us all about man's quest to find God! Even skeptics will want to read this insightful book - we all search for answers when bad things happen to us and those we love."
4,Starting Point,This book provides a starting point for someone who is trying to make sense how a God couldallow bad things to happen in this world which isn't in harmony with the our common understandingof a compansionate God.
4,Helpful and Thought Provoking,"While the theology doesn't get too deep, Kushner puts things into perspective using logic, science, wisdom, and a dash of faith. I appreciated his point of view and found the book brought a realistic comfort. I enjoyed reading his theories. In a way, he sucked the ""magic"" out of my world. I like believing that some things happen for a reason and that God has a plan for us - and Kushner's perspective doesn't support any of that. I was also a little disappointed not hearing more of Kushner's personal story: how he felt, what he went through, how he dealt with his tragedy. While elements of his story were touched on, we never got into some of the details that contributed to his views on why bad things happen to good people. I would have liked to learned more about that. Overall, an excellent book and an enjoyable, educational read."
2,Damaged,"Although I was aware this was a used copy, the large information sticker placed on the cloth outside cover of the back of the book decreased the quality of the overall book. Why not place this very large (over 1/2 the size of the back cover) sticker that had order info on it, on a bag containing the book."
3,Mixed feelings,"If you are looking for a Scriptural answer, this is not it. This book does provide other possibilities than the norm."
1,Made me more sad,"My 5 year old daughter drowned 2 months ago and I'm desperate for a reason why and desperate to feel better. This book made me feel more sad than anything. It basically said that God can't do anything. Well if God can't do anything, why would we pray then - for good things, for miracles for anything? The only thing I agreed with is the thought that, ""Well this happened to us - what do we do know?"" I hate hearing that God just wanted my daughter or needed her more than we do but feeling that it's part of God's plan feels better than God can do nothing and sucks to be us."
1,EVERLIFE IS LITTLELIGHT,LIVING IN FLORIDA I BOUGHT TWO OF THESE EVERLIFE FLASHLIGHTS. THE PARTY THAT SAID THAT THESE FLASHLIGHTS ARE CHARGED UP DURING SHIPPING IS SUFFERING FROM SHAKING OF THE HEAD. IT TAKES AT LEAST A MINUTE OF SHAKING AFTER DELIVERY BEFORE THE FLASHLIGHT IS GIVING OUT ITS MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF LIGHT WHICH IS VERY LOW. AFTER THAT TO KEEP IT OPERATING MORE SHAKING IS IN ORDER. THE ILLUMINATION WHICH IS VERY LOW COMPARED TO OTHER BATTERY FLASHIGHTS DIES OUT VERY RAPIDLY AND NEED ADDITIONAL SHAKING TO KEEP IT GOING. THIS FLASHLIHGT TO BE FAIR MAY COME IN HANDY DURING A HURRICANE POWER FAILURE. LED FLASHLIGHTS THAT USE BATTERIES ARE FAR SUPERIOR TO THESE SHAKING FLASHLIGHTS.THE BATTERIES LAST A VERY LONG TIME DUE TO THE LOW POWER THAT LEDS OPERATE AT.
3,mediocre,"It's a cool concept, but the intensity of the light is very poor. This flashlight is really only useful in extremely low light conditions and even then it only illuminates a small, targetted area.This flashlight should NOT be used as a replacement for a traditional battery powered one."
1,this product sucks,"Don't buy these, they don't even come to your house assembled. I bought one for my father for Christmas. It arrived competely disassembled! My father had to put it together himself. He says you have to vigurously shake it for 2 minutes to get a good light from it but it goes dim very fast after first minute and a half. Even if you keep doing it like the directions say, the normal battery operated flashlights are still better than these. I went through amazon and he got his in a week, I went through the main website to get my own and I've been waiting 2 and a half months (backorded). I'm expecting mine to come in pieces too apparently. My father says you cannot see beyond 8 feet with it and half that for the little one that normally comes with it. It's not worth the money for this product, it sucks."
4,Wonderful plays and performances - bad picture quality,"Keith Mitchell turned in the performance of a lifetime playing Henry VIII from his teens to old age. His performances in these 6 plays won him an Emmy Award for Best Dramatic Actor in a series (they didn't have a separate category for miniseries back then). These shows are entertaining and present an accurate feel for life in Tudor period England. While this is an ensemble piece, there are only a few outdoor scenes, relatively few players, and very plain sets. It is a pity that more care wasn't taken in preserving the original master tapes from both a video and audio perspective. Many scenes are washed out, blurred, and distorted. If there was ever a project worthy of digital restoration (or improvement) this would have been it. Still worth the price. Whether you are a history buff, a fan of theater or just a fan of English television, this is a set worth owning. Over thirty years later, this is still one of the finest miniseries ever broadcast."
3,Two Thirds,"This is a wonderful play, but unfortunately Disc 1 and Disc 2 had the same content though they were labeled differently. What a disappointment. I saw the series originally while living in England, as an expatriate, and would have loved to see the whole series again. I'm especially sorry to have missed the beginning. Ann Boleyn's story is fascinating."
4,very good!,"I thought this movie was good. The acting of Keith Mitchell ( Henry VIII ) was absolutlely fantastic! The makeup was intense. To see the transformation of Henry go from a young healthy prince to an old and diseased king was haunting. All of the six wives kept my attention and the performances were applaudable. I'm not an expert, but I have read several books on the king and it seems that these films stay true to history. Well worth the money it costs. The only reason I did not give this film 5 stars is simply because the set designs were sometimes poorly done. They could have spent a little more on that, but overall great films!"
5,The Six Wives Of Henry Eighth DVD,"I saw Six Wives Of Henry VIII in the 1970S on PBS and really enjoyed it. Also the fine English cast and Keith Michell was outstanding as Henry VIII. I have been looking for a lesser price over the years and was so happy to finally find it on Amazon. The swift delivery of the DVD also made me happy and yet another plus is the DVD special features shows ""The Other Boleyn Girl"" a 90 minute feature. Thanks Amazon, I think I got more than my moneys worth:)"
1,Please - Do Not Order this Item,"Do Not Order This Item! All of Amazon's stock is corrupt. Each 3 DVD set has only 2 DVDs with 1 of the DVDs being a duplicate of one of the others. In two shipments from Amazon the same mistake has happened twice. Yesterday we received an e-mail from an employee who is no longer with them today - admitting that indeed their entire shipment of this set was bad - as we pointed out to them over 5 weeks ago. ""Hey - we ain't made no money yet - but give us a chance to screw up your order too - twice!!!"""
2,Most boring play of The Six Wives of Henry VIII..,Really poor acting and very boring. I doubt that I will even watch the other two DVD's in the box. Wish I would have saved my money for something better..
5,Henry VIII and the girls,"This DVD, which I obtained from Amazon.com, is probably one of the best representations I have ever seen of this king and his transformation from an unworldly and artistic ruler into a viciously autocratic monarch who murdered two of his six wives and many other subjects. The actors are superb and I was very glad to purchase the DVD. I am more than pleased with the wide variety of Amazon.com DVDS dealing with this and other periods of history, particularly English history."
5,Fantastic Series Brilliantly Acted!,"A very well researched and executed miniseries on the six wives of Henry VIII. Every performance is outstanding and the only thing that might detract from your complete enjoyment are the low TV production values of the period in which it was produced. Nonetheless, it will provide you with many hours of engrossing and enlightening entertainment. Don't miss it."
1,What am I missing,"The good reviews leave me stumped. What do they see that I do not? The entire production is very high schoolish. The props obviously spray painted and wobbly, the acting is so bad as to be baffeling. I am embarassed how much I spent on this and do not see how this received the rave reviews it did."
4,Henry VIII back from the dead,"This VHS set of 6 episodes 90 min each covers all of his 6 wives, witch in 1 part I was dissapoted is out of all of the episodes it really covers his wives only (witch it is suppost to) but it whoud be better if they coved also more of England history at that time to. Kenith Michale (most likely miss spelt) brings Henry VIII back to life as he becomes a careing yound boy king and then becomes a king that whoud do anything to get what he wants."
1,People Actually Liked This?,"Good God was this terrible. Just awful. The acting, the writing, even the LIGHTING was bad. I usually don't notice things like lighting, but the excessive shadows everywhere sort of made me take notice. The sets are virtually non-existent. All the walls are bare - they didn't even have the decency to hang up some tapestries. I only made it through Catherine and Anne but the actresses were WAY too old for their parts. Catherine looks at least 30 at the beginning when she is supposed to be 16. And the worst part was that this series was downright boring. I can live with all of the above so long as they tell a good story. The producers didn't even need to come up with a good story - they had one, right in front of them, and this is what they did with it."
2,How could such an interesting period be so boring?,"Considering that few periods of history are as intriguing as the Tudor era, and that Henry's wives and his relationships with same are the stuff of which an entire library could be filled, the company which produced this series should receive a medal for originality. They managed what one would think impossible: reducing all and sundry to tiresome bores, with dialogue so banal that one would think the king and queens depicted were as lively as those one would find in a deck of cards."
3,Great Series -- Poor DVD Transfer,"I won't comment on the landmark TV production -- it remains as fresh and engrossing as when I first saw it 30 years ago. The big disappointment here is that BFS Video has chosen to squeeze the series onto 3 single sided DVDs -- over 2 1/2 hours of video per DVD. The result, sadly, is that the picture quality is compromised by compression artifacts that reduce it to VHS quality. Compared to (say) ""I, Claudius"", of similar vintage but presented on 2-sided discs, this transfer is really below par. If you don't have this series, get it, as you'll enjoy it regardless of the quality issues. If you have it on VHS, stick with this, as the DVD is not worth it."
5,ABSOLUTELY FASCINATING!!,"Totally engrossing series. Would recommend it to anyone with an interest in Henry. It is so interesting watching the transformation from a young king in love to someone who will stop at nothing to get what he wants.Incidently, the first disc was labeled correctly but had the content from disc 2 on it. All I had to do was email the company and I had a correct disc in my hands two weeks later at no charge."
3,Old series,"This 1970's era, low res series is reminiscent of a theatrical production with all 6 episodes set largely within a few sparsely decorated palace rooms. The series is driven by professionally trained Shakespearean actors totally relying on dialogue delivered by richly costumed characters to tell the unrelentingly sad, repetitive story of political intrigue, religious conflict, moral accusation and royal immaturity and fickleness. This series is a classic but is dated. It needs to be redone to modern video expectations."
4,Six Wives of Henry VIII,"This production may seem a little dated, but it is very well-acted. The costumes became more elaborate with each segment. I enjoyed the segments with scenes shot outdoors. The others seems more like theater. We enjoyed it. The Jane Seymour episode was my favorite."
3,something is wrong with my set,"For some reason, my disc 1 and disc 2 have exactly the same contents as disc 2, although they have different CD labels and cases. Seems like a manufacturing problem, it *might* be an entire production batch. From the advise of Amazon, I am returning the DVD set and getting a refund. Too bad I would have liked to watch this from the start. From what I have seen so far, I would rate the Audio-Video quality around 2.5 stars."
1,The six wives of Henry vii,Item was described as one tape- 540 minutes. E-mail confirming item was shipped said only one episode. Now I'll have to return item. Placed order of new one that says full series in top title. Hope for better results. Haven't had a discepency like this with outside vendor before and I've ordered movies before. Have to keep eye out with vendors now.
3,Henry viii,The product was in great shape. The production is very dated and does not stand the test of time as good theater.
4,Compelling tale....,"This was a good, readable book; and it told a compelling tale of a young hard-rock miner, from his stabs at different jobs to his eventual career as a miner. It takes one through his apprenticeship and various adventures in the silver mines of Idaho, until by the end of the book he is a competent silver miner. I would not call Mr. Dolph a great, or even a very good writer; in fact, I doubt if he would describe himself so. He writes with an honesty and a self-effacing wit that more than makes up for any stylistic shortcomings. This book delves into a lot of the minutiae in terms of tools and techniques that a miner needs to master, but I never found this to detract from the great tale he has to tell. And, in spite of, or perhaps because of, his slight shortcomings as a writer, this is a fascinating book. He writes like someone you might like to meet."
5,Hollywood insider reveals secrets,"Rannow has written a wonderful guide for the would-be comedy writer and a great read for everyone else. He shows us how to get the idea, write the script, sell it-- and ourselves-- to Hollywood, and even how to avoid those cocaine parties when we hit it big. He has put his considerable experience as a Hollywood comedy writer into a guide that's as honest and funny as it is helpful. Jerry never condescends. He simply assumes if he can do it, we can do it. Lots of excerpts from real scripts here and even some inside Hollywood gossip. Great book."
2,"""please stop talking about 'Head of the class'""","The structure in writing a script was very good, but everytime it starts to get interesting he starts breaking down scenes from head of the class. The show died 22 years ago Jerry . . . let it go. Everytime he mentions a scene I already know its going to be corny and hokey which keeps discouraging me from finishing the book. The structure in writing a script is the only thing that saved this book."
1,Watch Out!,"Do not believe the hype! While Jerry Rannows Writing Television Comedy gives a fairly accurate picture of the wellknown ""spec-script/pitching"" process that could land you a professional assignment, there is not much in here that would make you carry this assignment through. Stale, inadequate and set in a jokey, unbearably selfimportant prose. I advise any interested in the subject to checkout John Vorhaus ""The Comic Toolbox"" or the books by JÃ¼rgen Wolff or Gene Perret. These are full of insights and healthy tips on method to the madness."
3,Overrated but not bad.,"This book is pretty helpful in offering structural advice and giving pointers from someone who has been successful in the business. However, it is clear that this comedy writer's time has passed. His jokes were so corny and unfunny (for the most part but not entirely) that I would find myself getting frustrated to the point where I would have to put the book down for a while. You've already proven yourself as a writer Jerry, there's no need to try and be cute and add unnecessary jokes into your book. Not a bad book but it seems like all of these books pretty much say the same thing anyway."
1,"Reenacted, nothing new.","Except for a few seconds on the second tape, all footage consists of re-enactments. There is a lot less material about selection than in the book ""Immediate Action"" by Andy McNab. If you've read anything serious about the SAS, you won't learn anything new from this video, and you'll find it covers very little."
2,Nothing new,"I have interest in the special forces as a friend of mine is going for selection soon and I wanted to find out what he might have to go through. I've read the Andy McNab books (which are excellent by the way) and was looking for any dvd information. 'Special Air Service - The Soldiers Story' turned out to be several television programmes rolled into a dvd. The research into the topic feels very rushed and thrown together. The sound quality is poor and the content will probably only please those who have absolutely no prior information on the subject. In fairness, I had high expectations from this dvd but, with little more than McNab's books to go by, this provides very little further interest.Probably best to stick to publications on the subject, books or magazines. Although Bravo 2-0 (dvd) wasn't bad."
2,SAS-not like being there.,"I,ve always had an interest in this military unit and have wanted to find out more about it. After watching this dvd, I find I know as much now as I did before. Not terrible but then not very good either. It looks like they ran out of money half way through a History channel project, which may explain why I had not seen this ""documentary"" on TV. A real sense of incompleteness pervades this production and leaves you wanting more-of something else. Rent it unless you must have absolutly ANYTHING regarding the SAS."
4,"Not much detail, but good nonetheless!","very little detail can be given about the SAS as obviously they have to maintain a certain level of secrecy! the selection process is shown to be tough as it is, aswell as this DVD i would recommend ""Bravo Two Zero"" as it shows more detail and a real life event that occured to an SAS soldier. This DVD isn't anything particularly special, almost as if it was made in a rush! a must for anyone with an interest in special forces, although not necessarily the best in the line of documentary DVD's. To my dismay there was not much coverage on the iranian embassy siege which was very disappointing, but like i say they can't go into too much detail. ..."
3,Good but not excellent,"The DVD version I assume is identical to the VHS version, I originally purchased it thinking that there would be a greater wealth of information on weapons / tactics.I found the documentary interesting, probarbly more so being from the UK, however, due to the secretive nature of SAS training very little information can be given.A good glimse at SAS selection is given and the Gulf War segment is sure to interest any Special Ops buff.My only real complaint was the lack of DVD features."
3,Its ok,"The Gulf war section is pretty good, but the rest are pretty boring. Very little about the Iran embassy are discuss in this video."
2,Phillip Bastians - Very ignorant of reality,"The video is OK, the review from Phillip Bastians just demonstrates the level of ignorance from some of the viewers.Too bad the SAS was not around back in the seventeen hundreds, when our unconventional warriors sent the British running back to England, crying about the unfair way to fight of the real UW warriors."
3,"Funny, sad, heart-warming story of loss and survival.","Julia Sweeney manages to do what seems impossible: to find hope and humour in a devastating situation, as she supports her brother's ultimately unsuccessful battle with cancer, then faces her own experience with cancer. This book is witty and frank, and it brought both tears and laughter as I read it. For anyone facing cancer, or struggling to cope with the disease in someone they love, this book will provide a cheering diversion. It's a great ""waiting-room"" read, too, and should be a staple in every cancer clinic and hospital library."
4,I get it,"I really laughed out loud at certain parts of Julia's monologue. What I love is that she can be a well known ""star"" and yet still weather the emotional day to day-ness of living with her brother's diagnosis.......knowing full well that humor can get us all through life's worst curveballs! I thought this dvd was great...a real treat .... very human!"
3,"god said ha, i say nah.","it's got heart, but it gets a little too personal to remain of universal interest, unless you know julia sweeney or knew her brother. she is witty and has great delivery & timing, but i expected a bit more humor and a little less sappiness. i had heard an interview in which she discussed her take on religion and how she fell ""out of touch"" with (her) god, and the comments she made in the interview where awesome, thought provoking. i misunderstood that this dvd was similar to the ""routine"" she performed on the radio interview. the dvd would be a great way to ease into the mourning period if someone close to you was dying of cancer, but still active in many ways."
5,5 stars for Julia Sweeney,"I have always been a big fan of Julia Sweeney. When I found out that she had written a book I was pumped to get my hands on it. Finally when I picked up the book and started reading it, I was simply amazed. I could not put the book down. This book is full of emotions. I laughed, cried, sympathized and laughed some more. In this book she shares the hardships of the divorce from her true love,childhood memories,her family,and the main focus was when the news came that her younger brother,Mike,had cancer. She wrote about her family all comming together in a time of greif. I loved the title of her book. When I first heard it was wondering how it fit the book. To my surprize it fit it to a ""Tee"". Just as she thought her life was panning out ""God Said,""Ha""."
4,Good for the whole family....,"My husband is not into Disney, but watched this one with me when it first aired on TV and loved it. He actually is the one who bought it to watch over and over again. Now, we have a daughter who we hope will like it as much as we did. If anyone knows the name of the song she does her little dance too, please email me at tazmom2214@aol.com. My husband has been trying to find it since forever. Thanks."
2,all about teeth,This movie was good. But it was all about teeth. It's kind of good because it's about friends.
5,Great movie...and 90's classic,"When I was a child, I loved this movie, and I had forgotten all about it. So I was searching the internet, and I stumbled across this, and I was like, ""Hey! I remember that movie"" and since then I just had to own it. It's one of my favorite childhood movies, this, Smart House, and The Thirteenth Year. The movie is for a great price, so don't miss out :)"
3,Toothless DVD,Received in a manila type envelope.Case was broken and cracked in many places.The DVD was loose in the case and had many scratches.DVD plays but has a few 'blips'.
1,Crying is good for babies?,"I would give this book no stars if that were possible. Babies need to cry for their emotional health? No one would ever think of telling a distraught adult some of the things written about in this book. I do not understand how any normal person could treat a baby like this. Where do these ""repressed"" feelings the baby needs to express come from? The womb? What could a baby have possibly gone through that is so traumatic it just needs to cry? You create a situation where a baby needs to cry by not cuddling and nursing often. Even an adult would cry in that situation. Consider reading James McKenna's studies or Dr. Sears' books as an alternative."
1,What a bunch of ...!,... I bought this book on a recommendation. My son throws tantrums and fits since he was 9 months old. I don't think there's been a day since that he's had a forehead without a bruise from his headbanging. This book is a bunch of [stuff] and no help whatsoever. Hopefully the 2 Dr. Sears books will provide insight.
5,Tears and Tantrums,Aletha Solter deserves an award for this book! Ever since I read this book I feel like a whole new world of parenting has been opened up to me -I no longer get stressed about my baby's crying now that I understand the 'why' and putting him to bed never takes more than 10 minutes and is effortless. This is a book for everyone -not only for parents -it will help you to understand your children better and put parenting into proper perspective. This book should be mandatory for every new mom!
3,Lacking Sound Quality,"I love Fred Hammond and all of the POL, but CD is lacking in sound quality. The music itself is awesome, but I already had the DVD and was expecting the same quality of sound, but this one is lacking. If you use stereo headphones, it's somewhat better. Please let me be clear in that the sound quality is of no reflection to the songs on the CD, yes Fred has, as always, delivered some of the best gospel music ever on this work. My only issue is because of the poor sound quality, I couldn't enjoy this awesome music at its best."
3,Shaolin Ten-Animal Form,"An interesting book by a well-known kung fu master like Kwan Tak Hing. But unfortunately, the presentation is not systematic. A lot of details in executing the techniques have been left unmentioned thus making such a book only good for information but lacking in essence. I bought it because of Kwan Tak Hing. Otherwise, I wouldn't even consider purchasing it. The same can be said of Leung Ting's other books on the Five-Pattern Hung Kuen - plain waste of money."
1,Five stars for content -- no stars for book quality,"[money] and the book is literally coming apart at the seams. I've tried glue. I've tried gentleness. It lives in the same backpack as my other textbooks, only it's not up to the wear and tear like the others.I'd like another but who has time to copy all those little notes in the margins and pencilled in answers to homework.Bummer that such good material was cheaply bound."
5,"Overall, though, it's excellent","Don't let any of the so-called ""shortcomings"" I wrote of above stop you from buying this book-- you really will get an excellent education."
5,Justin Wilson's Homegrown Louisiana Cookin',Excellent cookbook. Easy to follow receipes. My husband pours over that book and tries a new one each week. He cooks on the weekends. I am more of a meat and potatoes eater but I have liked everything he has tried so far.
5,As I remembered,I had this cookbook years ago and lost it. I found it online and it is exactly the same book. So glad.
2,"I loved old Justin, but.....","I acquired this cookbook when it first came out and harbored high expectations for the content. At this point, they are all pretty much dashed.I cook every day and have for years. The best of these recipes is mediocre. On one occasion, I clearly recall preparing yet another of Justin's dishes and, just as it was nearing completion, my wife strolled into the kitchen with a wrinkled nose and said, ""What stinks?"" Sadly, she was right.I DID give the book an extra star here because I loved the homegrown photographs which were snapped by Justin's pretty wife. I thought that they were really good and quite reflective of his regional cooking.If you really want an outstanding cajun cookbook, grab a copy of Paul Prudhommes, ""Chef Paul Prudhomme's Louisiana Kitchen"":Chef Paul Prudhomme's Louisiana KitchenI actually did love old Justin and I think his cooking show was more fun than any other which ever aired on television -- but you can safely skip these recipes."
1,Not worth the time or money,I am a med student who was looking for specific information about specialties and this book was worthless. It was extremely short and about 1/3 of its pages were comprised of a list of medical schools. The only possible use for this book is for a middle or high school student who lacks even the most rudimentary knowledge about medial education and practice.
5,just what I needed,This book helped alot when it came time to evaluated the Stangl pieces that I already owned and was looking at buying
5,My son loves Geometry - probably because of this book,"My son is the creative type and hated his Algebra class - didn't use a Jacob's Algebra book unfortunately. Geometry, however, fascinates him, due to a large degree, I believe, on the creative presentation of this book. Highly recommend Jacobs."
2,too much visual,"There are far too much designs, visuals, colors, etc in the book - this is highly distracting, as TV screen can be...By way of example (among so many...), what is the use of colors with the three squares of the Pyth. theorem???? this is as useless as writting 2+3=5 with 2 in blue, 3 in red and 5 in yellow...I wish I had purchased the 2nd edition, which according to reviews was closer to what I was looking for."
2,Bring Back The 2nd Edition,"After the 2nd edition, which was an inspired work, this one is a big disappointment. Important topics fell out and the organization is chaotic. Bring back the 2nd edition."
1,Ruff Dawg K9 Flyer Dog Toy,This frisbee is too heavy to throw. You throw and it immediately comes down your dog cannot catch because of this.I actually would give it 0 stars. Definitely do not spend your money on this product. WASTE
2,"Not rugged, Not durable","It flies okay, but my border collie ripped through this thin rubber disc in a matter of minutes. After 5 or 6 throws, she had sliced the rim in two places. The very best non destructible, flexible dog disc is the West Paw Design Zogoflex. Check out the reviews and buy it if you want a really rugged flying disc."
5,"Best frisby ever. Strong, fun and easy on teeth.","My lab mix dog loves to catch frisbees but he also loves to chew them. Rubber/plastic toys often last a week or a month but this one lasted two years with heavy ware. He chews on it, plays tug of war with it, sleeps on it, catches it in mid air. It is a household favorite. We are on our second k9 flyer and I would recommend this to any dog how likes to catch and fetch. RuffDawg products are great!"
3,"Good Product, But Not a Frisbee","This is a great product. Virtually indestructable, but don't be fooled! It is NOT a Frisbee. It's a floppy disk that can fly if thrown properly. When it does fly it's never in the direction that you wanted it to go, but my dogs love it none the less. So if you're actually looking for a Frisbee this isn't for you. If you have a dog that does shred Frisbees this will last. But don't plan on being able to actually Frisbee train your dog with this product."
1,JUNK,This product lasted only hours with my 9 month old black lab and I made the mistake of buying two of them..what a waste of money !!! The only reason I gave it one star is because I couldn't use zero...
3,Love the product- wish it lasted more than a couple weeks,"Length:: 0:31 MinsThis is a small video of this flyer that my 45 lb Aussie male Zuzu had for a couple weeks. He has destroyed every brand during normal play as he worries them briefly on the way back to me and has teeth like a shark. But he's only 45 lbs and doesn't get to chew on this outside of indoor frisbee flying time. West Paw Zogoflex has lasted the longest at a couple months, but the last one I bought for him lasted 3 weeks. Kong's was destroyed in a week or less. I am pretty sure they use his teeth to cut diamonds.Ruff Dawg K9 Flyer Dog Toy, Assorted Colors"
4,A good suspense flick,"It kept you guessing until near the end. One nice thing is the characters are actually likeable. Many suspense films have characters who you would just as soon see axed so you don't have to watch them any more, but JoBeth Williams does very well."
2,Not at all like the book.,"This movie is more like an idea someone got after they read Summer of The Monkeys, than an actual interpretation of the book. For some reason they decided all of the Monkeys would be Chimps, which they are not. Gave then different names, all but eliminated Grandpa's role in catching the Monkeys and added a bunch of new scenes. All in all, it doesn't come close to the book."
5,Top Notch Family Film,"A delightful family film where the family (including the 2 children) show that they care for and love one another. The boy has some disapointments and sucesses and grows through these learning to put some sibling rivalry behind him as he becomes more selfless and devoted to others. He learns wonderful lessons that any parent would want their own child to learn, and understand. The heartwarming story takes place on a farm, a small town, and along a river sometime around 1920 or so, give or take a decade. The values are exemplary and any child could watch this probably without the parent having to worry. Watching it as a family however would be more rewarding, and I think little boys would especially appreciate the film and lessons."
4,Great storyline with a message.,"Nice family movie, with a lot of touching moments and likable characters. My family loved the wise & kind Grandfather and enjoyed his bonded relationship with the young boy. Warning for the very young; there is a quick scene showing a dead body."
5,Patsy's favorite,"My daughter has this movie in VHS and loves it, but VCR broke and no longer able to watch it. She was so excited when I found the DVD. She has already watched it to many times to count."
3,Monkeys Around With The Book (A Little),"Set in the 1800s on the sunkissed prairies of Canada, Summer of the Monkeys follows the story of Jay (Corey Sevier), a young boy who dreams of getting enough money to buy a pony named Annie. When Jay finds four chimps (played by Henri, Antoinette, Jacques, and Dominique) who have fallen off a wrecked circus train and become lost, he realizes that if he turns them in he can collect a big reward -- money enough to buy Annie. Conflict enters the picture when Jay gets attached to the silly simians, and doesn't want to return them to the circus. But then his sister falls ill, and family needs money for her operation.The movie is not as good as the book, and there is a lot less on the horse plot than equestrians will hope... still, it's a solid Disney movie."
3,Good movie but not as great as the book.,"To anyone who likes this movie, I would highly recommend that you read the book. The movie leaves out some of the best parts in the book. I still like the movie though, and it is great for the whole family."
2,Nothing like the Book,"We read the book as a family and decided to buy the video. There were similarities between the book and movie, but overall it was quite disappointing. While the movie fine -- it's cute and fun -- I recommend that your rent the video and buy the book."
1,summer of the boring,I really don't like Summer of the monkeys because it doesn't follow the book.THe book is much better. Take my advice and read the book and not watch the movie
2,harder to read than skiing a black diamond,"this book is literally about the physics of snow and skiing.I was a science major in college, have two advanced degrees, feel comfortable with high tech equipment and I felt like I was reading a college textbook when I read this book."
4,My My When elephants can fly,This is a funny movie in the US Services with Danny Glover turning over his post to a new commander Ray Loita who is very green to the area of the jungle and the ways of the villagers. He learns real quickly all about elephants and many ways to travel with one. Lots of laughs through out the movie especially when you get to see an elephant fly.
4,"Great movie, but with a lot of language.","Overall, I thought that it was a great movie, very funny, but I think that they had way too much profanity in it. The actors did a great job, I think that they had fun doing it too. I don't think that they should have had so much stuff about the Hindu religion, I think that it should have been more centered on God, and actual events that happened, rather than on what they don't have proof of. Great movie, I would reccommend it except for the language. It's funny!"
3,Funny enough comedy with a unique story,"It's wartime in Vietnam, and American soldiers inadvertently cause the shooting death of a revered elephant belonging to the citizens of Dak Nhe. Oops. To appease the Vietnamese villagers who loved their mascot, the blundering soldiers (Ray Liotta and Danny Glover) take it upon themselves to replace the punctured pachyderm. Easy as that, they find Bo-Tat (played by Tai) and have her airlifted and gently dropped into the remote area. Interesting, good action, so-so on the comedy.Staci Layne Wilson"
3,No subtitles??,"The version I saw in theater had subtitles for what the Viet Cong were saying. Due to the film being in Full Screen scan and pan the subtitles for the Vietnamese is missing, so you're missing out on 25-50% of the story of what's going on. Additionally you miss the final comment by the VC soldier, which was funny. It's still a great movie, but Disney really screwed this release up by not reformatting the subtitle to fit the full frame edition they stuck it in.** EDIT** Had English subtitles on, so the Vietnamese wasn't shown as it loaded thru the captions. I leave my rating at 3 due to no Widescreen version or special features worth mentioning though. It wasn't a bad movie, it deserves a better DVD treatment, esp from a company like Disney."
2,Spanish Invades Again!,"I really like this movie, USUALLY. However, what makes it worth watching is the subtitles for the Vietnamese. When I ordered this DVD, I was expecting subtitles I could read. The only options for subtitles were ""Spanish"" or ""None"". I was extremely disappointed and angry that I can't even get subtitles in my own language in America!!! The storyline is nice because it is based on a true story but when you don't know what the VC are saying, you lose a lot in the emotion of the movie."
1,Operation Dumbo Drop,Very disapointed after waiting nearly a month for its arrival. The sound quality was rubbish it kept going loud and soft I`m Shore I wont be watching it again.
5,A Really Fun Movie,The characters and story line are great. Dennis Leary is his usual quirky self which added to the humor. Great movie.
3,Purplecow,"I agree - UNLESS YOU ALREADY SAW THIS MOVIE on DVD, you may not know what we (other previewers and myself) are talking about.......BUT, the omission of the SUBTITLES takes away ALOT from the movie. Walt Disney studios has robbed the people purchasing the DVD.Its such a small thing to include the SUBTITLES, so it really makes you wonder WHY they didn't!?!?!?!?! I refuse to buy it without the SUBTITLES, and will tell everyone else NOT TO, as well!!!! : ("
2,No subtitles? Not worth the money!,"My rating is for the dvd itself, not for the movie. The movie is delightful and heartwarming, but Disney trashed it by leaving out the subtitles which are so necessary here to get the full story. Even though I've seen the original version and can somewhat remember what was ""said"", anyone trying to watch this for the first time on DVD would be lost several times during the movie, and miss much of what happens.Shame on you Disney! We expect better!"
5,Well done...,"Highly enjoyable, detailed overview of a war which, frankly, I knew very little about. Chapter I describing the ""why"" of this war is critical."
2,Avoid,"I swear, I don't know who's writing reviews that rate documentaries like this one 5 stars. First, the voice over for the entire series is very drab and can even be desrcibed as nerve jarring. Second, the man cannot even pronounce half of the names correctly; nor does he ever develop any rhythm... It's not that this documentary gets too many facts wrong, it's that the production value is haphazard and lackadaisical. I recommend turning of the sound and relying on Closed Captioning if you must view."
4,Great Video,"By combining fun plants and globe-trotting, likeable characters they have created a fun way to learn geography and history and world culture without realizing that you are learning...I have enjoyed watching (and even re-watching) this video - not surprisingly my son enjoyed it even more. The three videos I own in the series were educational (without being pedantic) and fast paced. Highly recommended for children ages 5 through 12.There is a bit of fighting (fortunately no killing and no blood) which may make it inappropriate for very young children.Please find out when the series will be re-released. They were great."
2,Uneven is the Keyword,"Helen Mirren can always dazzle; all these Brits are so well trained but this vehicle is not up to their talents. David Morrissey looks promising, but is uneven in this part. He's good playing innocent but I didn't buy his character's evil side. It may be the fault of the screen play. They managed to take an interesting (true) story and totally muddle it. I'd love to see this re-made for the big screen."
2,sound muffled and dry,Klien's interpretation of the sonatas is lovely and classically restrained. Unfortunately the sound of the discs is painfully dry and muffled.
1,Awful,"I bought the complete set, so I could get familiar with all of Schubert's piano works. After a couple of weeks, I threw all the disks away. There are much finer artists who bring individuality, verve and style to some of the greatest piano music ever written. Unfortunately, Mr. Kempf is not one of them."
4,A very nice Turkish cookbook!,"I was looking for a nice, authentic Turkish cookbook as my husband was born and raised there. No mediocre recipes would do in this case...he was an expert in the cuisine!! Well, I got this book and was very pleased. The color pictures in the book are gorgeous and the recipes are easy to follow with ingredients that are readily available, yet still make authentic tasting foods. The one complaint I have about the book has nothing to do with the content. The book binding, in my case, seems somewhat flimsy. It is a softcover book, and sections of my binding were loose and coming apart upon arrival. Therefore, just be forewarned that the construction of the book is mediocre, but the content is superb!! The Imam Bayaldi (Swooning Imam) dish was a big hit with my husband, as was the Dugun Corbasi (Wedding Soup). The Circassian Chicken was AMAZING...it's one of my favorite recipes."
5,Turkish Cookbook,A paper bound book the original hardback of which I saw in Istanbul but didn't want to carry on my long trip. This one is the same- the same pictures and recipes and I am happy to have it. A keeper.
5,"Beautiful, Tasty and Slightly Exotic Cusine","I bought The Sultan's Kitchen about two years ago and have tried many of the recipes. The results have been delicious! I especially like the summer salads which use some ingredients like dandelion and purslane which are available, but ignored in most cookbooks. The Shepherd's Salad is a household favorite and a good ""make ahead"" light meal.As the author indicates in the preface, this is not fast cooking. It does not use prepared ingredients and you don't ""throw it together."" You cook slowly and lovingly. But most of the recipes are not difficult and the results are worth the effort.I also want to mention that this book is a feast for the eyes as well as the mouth. Instead of food presented against white backgrounds, bold color abounds. The dishes, glasses and tableware are in vibrant colors and add to the ethnic appeal. The recipes are on softly colored pages, which for me, makes them easy to find. All in all, Sultan's Kitchen is a very enjoyable cookbook."
5,Mediterranean Diet Haven!,"I have this cookbook, and cook from it at least once a week. The recipes are well thought out and always tasty. Recently, I adopted a mediterranean diet, and found that I could eat foods I really liked, and still be healthy. However, lunch was always a problem. I'm lucky enough to work around the corner from the restaurant, Sultan's Kitchen, where Ozcan cooks. This is where the recipes come from. They are healthy, they are tasty and they are very well tested. I highly recommend this book for anyone looking to adopt a healthy diet or looking for turkish recipes."
4,Savoring Turkey,"This is a good all around, and reasonably priced cookbook. I just returned from Turkey and this book has many of the dishes that I loved when I was there."
4,"Beautiful book, excellent recipes good reference","We just got back fromTurkey and the recipes are excellent! Also good to look at as far as just reading. My Lebanese friend, who is an excellent cook, finds the seasonings authentic. I am giving her a copy!"
4,Ottoman Delight,An excellent book for lovers of traditional Turkish food-easy to understand and beautifully illustrated.I have travelled many times to Turkey and have never found an English language Turkish cookbook like this.
2,did not think the recipes looked easy,"I was just about to buy Binnur's Turkish cookbook when I read a few reviews mentioning this cookbook as being GREAT! I figured since it was by a professional chef it would be better...I actually don't think the book is ""easy"" and it doesn't remind me of Turkish homecooking. A lot of Binnur's dishes are what my mother makes and at least for me, her recipes are a lot simpler and easier to make."
4,Best record from this unit,"Steve Coleman has played in a lot of different formations, and this one, while not my personal favorite, is a super-strong batch of cats. They're his funkiest unit by far, and they bring a great flavor to his trademark odd-timed beats and quick swing. Coleman compositions are difficult to play (and not party records), but these guys make them sing and give us a very good jazz record with new ideas."
3,cheesey esata,"Upon receiving this everything appeared to be normal. With the product packed well, I was impressed by the case and easy of set up.After set up, though, it failed to connect to my computer.I checked the connection and when I removed to esata cable, the tab inside came out with the cable.I was able to connect it through the usb without any issue, though slower than esata.Maybe should have returned, but works great other than that."
4,External Hard Drive,Works good. Could not get the Sata to work. The USB connection works great for my needs
1,not good item,"My experience was: The product sold, isn't the one in the picture. In function it's the same, but it looks completely different. When I recieved the product, it didn't have a power cord; however, Amazon did provide a 25% refund on it. That didn't matter though because in the end, the Hard drive was faulty. It didn't even register on my computer when I plugged it in. After about 5-6 hours waisted, trying to get it to work, I had to send it back. Overall, I lost time and money while trying to buy this product; though I got a full refund, I had to buy a power source, that is no use to me now."
1,After a week my computer refused to recognize the drive,"It's good that I had not stored any critical data by the time. I have asked for a replacement drive. It is highly unreliable. Once I get the replacement, I will only use it for storing some redundant copies of photos and other media. I will never trust any critical data to this device."
3,Works but missing one feature I expected,"I was surprised to find that the unit does not turn off automatically when you turn off the computer. I have an external drive from another company that does this fine. Otherwise, the drive worked fine, but I returned mine."
4,Cavalry 500GB SATA External Hard Drive,"Very Very Good. working good, I would like to have more 500GB hard drive like this oneCavalry CAXM37500 3.5-Inch 500GB SATA External Hard Drive"
1,Got it defective,"I was happy about this HD since all my internal HDs are full .. But got it defective . went to comp tech shop and they couldn`t fix it , said it can not be fixed . Frustrated to be honest , so be careful ."
4,gr8 experience in using Cavalry,"It was really a great experience using ""Cavalry HDD"". I would have more happy if the size was little less."
1,dead :(,"This external HDD died on me only after couple of months :PFirst the computer wont recognize it and then it just went ""puffffff"" no sign of life was showing... what a waste :|"
1,Died after 3 months.,Just died after 3 or 4 months. I only needed it for a video project. Luckily I had finished it submitted it to my class before it broke down. It really unfortunate though because I lost my project files and I really wanted to edit it some more. I would not recommend this to anyone.
1,Overheats within one minute of power on!,"The day I had received this hard drive I turned it on, plunged it into my computer and transferred over some data. Literally within a minute of being turned on this thing begins to overheat. When I mean overheat I mean I couldn't touch it for more than a second or two without it burning my hand. It literally felt like I was touching a hot frying pan. I have a desk fan blowing onto it ask I type this to keep the temperature down. It works but I'm questioning the lifespan of the hard drive. I'm most likely going to have to struggle with Amazon to return this product (I'm going to assume it's defective as not many other reviewers commented on this heat issue)."
1,Buyer Beware,"Cavalry stuff has big problems with quality control, hence some rating it 5 in these reviews. Buying one is a roll of the dice -- it will either work fine or be dead on arrival. After receiving my latest drive and finding it to be completely non-functional right out of the box, I won't be purchasing anything of this brand again. Don't expect customer service either, their web site has some comments about a 3rd party company doing all their support. So the company makes low grade hooch, and won't stand behind it either."
1,Mine didn't work :-(,"I am so disappointed with this item, so far at least. It didn't work, I purchased it based on reviews on Amazon and had high hopes for it. After setting it up the computer did not recognize it and after spending an hour on the phone with tech support, they said ""it happens sometimes"" and to send it back. It was a gift for someone and I am very embarrassed that it didn't work.Tech Support said it was purchased at BEST BUY....Amazon didn't bother to tell me that :-(I hope the replacement, if they give me one, works."
2,"Great drive, crappy usb port","I've had this thing for over a year, and it works...but only if the usb cord is pulled just so. Apparently the usb port on the hard drive is crooked, so you have to shove a splint in between the power and the usb to even get the computer to recognize it. It was a good price, but only because of the cheap connections, I guess. I would definitely pay a little more for the more expensive brand. I'm staying away from Cavalry now, since I have to buy a new one, which sucks because the drive still works. I'm just tired of screwing with it."
4,Added to TiVo: simple setup and works perfectly,"I purchased this HD to expand the storage of my TiVo. Installation couldn't have been simpler: I plugged it in and the TiVo found it immediately. It's worked faithfully since (about six weeks). The quality of the casing is solid, nothing feels cheap.I only gave four stars due to the fact I've only had the drive for a short time and use it in a limited manner. But for how I use it, it's worked perfectly and is a very good value."
4,"so far, so good","I bought the drive because I began storing a lot of work-related data on my home pc and I was tired of backing up to DVDs (though I still do but with less frequency). The system is quite fast if you use the eSATA connection and works well with other backup software (I use Ghost 14.0). It's quiet and set up was very easy. Windows XP had no trouble recognizing it. I've tried a restore of selected files with no trouble though I haven't tried a full image restore. The only thing that is the least bit annoying is the aircraft landing light they put on the front. It's an actinic blue and more than a little irritating since all it does is indicate drive use. That's a pretty small issue so, on the whole, I'm very happy with it."
2,Um...Not so great,"Slim volume with few artistic nudes (mostly clothed models). Very dated (80's?)! This is a generally disapointing volume, don't waste you money!"
1,I didn't like this book,"Too many wangs for me, sticking up to say ""Hi there"". I likes ""The American Boy, A Photographic Essay"" much better. Guess I should have guessed that ""WhIte Boys"" would be like it is, from the cover."
3,S thoughts,"A young boy named Pete is struggling with his faith and the faith of his best friend, Rufus. An itinterant revival preacher comes to town and creates problems for 13 - year - old Pete and his family. When Pete discovers the truth about the preacher, the problem is resolved.I did enjoy this book. It definitely captured the importance of friendship and the vulnerablity of children. The author reaches emotional levels that involve family, religion, and friendship."
1,Worst documentary I've ever seen,"Biography usually does a pretty good job with their documentaries, but let me tell you this is not one of them! Only a handful of people are interviewed during this hour-long video, none of them who really knew Clark Gable well and don't have much to say. You get the impression that Gable's biographer, giving certain accounts of Gable's life, has about two hours of sleep the night before. Meanwhile, nearly a quarter of the screen time seems to be given to Gable's white-trash son, who was born after Gable's death and therefore didn't really know his father, and proves it by seeming to talk more about his own life than his father's. I got the impression that they had to include him in the film just to get access to photographs in the family album.Poor editing, with virtually no interesting content to boot, makes this a sad documentary indeed."
4,Quick delivery and product in good condition,My daughter needed this item for school so quick delivery was a must. The item came as expected with no delay. The item was in the condition as described.
4,satisfied,I was completely satisfied with the condition of the book and the fast and prompt delivery of the item listed above.
3,Its O.K.,"hey im an 8th grader in advanced classes. this book is okay cuz it has clean organization and stuff, and ive seen MUCH worse. lmao. it also has the *special* features like the study guides, extra help, and online resources. the really bad 1 i used in 7th grade, alg 1, by some otha company, was like 20 years old and uncolorful, stinkiyyy, boring, and unhelpful. lol i got a C. this book, however, isn't as bad, and also easyer to read. but its still math, one of my most unfavorite subjects!!! anyways, thank u 4 ur time and patience."
3,Better than the rest but still not great,"This math book is far better than the others, but that is mainly because the others I looked at were very bad.The typical math book today contains 1) lots of distracting pictures, 2) dozens of unnecessary fonts and colors, 3) lots of forced and contrived examples that have a politically correct focus and, 4) very little math instruction.This book has fewer distractions than the others (although it still has far too many). The actual instruction, that is, the explanation of the concepts, is often very brief and terse. Each section, however, has numerous example problems that are often very clear and helpful. The book is also well organized and the format is fairly readable. Not a great book, but much better than the others I looked at."
2,A terrible book,"I'm working out of this book in high school these days - I actually am in high school but I used the kid's review because I've no account - but it's really the worst math textbook I have ever used. It gives practice problems with certain factors that are not explained in the text. In its attempt to teach methods, it provides examples with little or no explanation of how to perform the steps. It recieves two stars only because you can sometimes figure out how to complete a problem by looking up the answers to the odd questions in the back of the book. If you, like me, are being forced to study from this book, do yourself a favor and take great notes in class."
3,Don't review the seller... review the book!,"More and more, people are posting reviews of the SELLERS of the book rather than Reviews of the CONTENT of the book itself. Giving your seller a 5 star rating for a 3 star book gives everyone the impression that the book is worth 5 stars(!) Again, rate the book, not the seller.As for the book itself it's just okay. There are few other better ALG 2 books out there."
2,Confusing and Somewhat Boring,"I am a Math teacher and tutor and this book is BORING. Many of the problems which the student is asked to do in the exercises at the end of each chapter border on the irrelevant. Unfortunately, I am currently tutoring some students who are required to ""endure"" this textbook. ..."
1,Never received order,"Ordered my son's textbook 8/20 and after 3 attempts to contact the seller (Sept, 13, 15 and 16) with no reply I ended up filing a claim. Very disappointed with seller."
1,Disappointed about this order,I am so disappointed about this order because I never receive the book from the seller. I sent two e-mails for the status but never receive a reply from the seller. I'm really very upset about it. This is the first time I've ever encounter this problem with Amazon. I really loss confident with purchasing products from Amazon now.
1,Algebra 2 book listing,"I returned the book because after I paid for it, I found something in the information that I hadn't been able to see beforehand in the listing, and it said that the book was paperback. We did not want paperback, and also had someone contact us who'd had this course before at the school where the class is, and we bought a used hardback Algebra 2 book from them for less than half what we had paid for this one. The course itself is pretty good."
1,Not as inexpensive as you would think,"I shopped around a lot before I purchased this book from a used book dealer. I needed more than one, so I had to shop around. I ended up buying more than a few. These books are in excellent shape, no highlighting, no writing in the books, and fantastic bindings. The base price was less than most of the prices in the Amazon listing. Even the publisher's price for a NEW book was less than most of the listings in Amazon. I find it sad that folks are selling books with higher prices than the publisher is charging for a new one."
3,"Pretty average, depends on your intentions","In 9th grade, while taking Algebra 2 / Analysis, I used this book. Well, I didn't ""use"" it to learn the material. (Partly because I knew it all anyway, but that's besides the point.) The truth is that this book doesn't really teach you much as it's explanations are breif and I never really read them anyway. It's good it you want to do homework problems as it has many problems and even solutions in the back.Therefore, it really matters what you intend to use this textbook for. If it's just for homework and doing problems, it's good. If it's to teach an entire Algebra 2 course, it's not so good."
3,not to good,"The book itself is bad enough. it teaches you as though it was teaching a mathmatician. i am a student, and the whole class has c's,d's,and f's. it does not give any other information that students would be confused about"
4,Algebra 2 Textbook,This is an excellent text for the Algebra 2 student. It gives good illustrationsand instructions for the student's independent work.
2,Mediocre text,"This is a mediocre text at best, which we bought when my teen went to public school to replace what we'd been using at home. It is not well written, the instruction is poor and the word problems are not particularly well done."
5,Spiritual Sojourn,"I found myself time and again, pondering the greater questions of life, love and the God consciousness that all humankind yearns and struggles towards. Thought provoking and relevant. Kudos, Mr. Jobson may your pen never be still."
3,book lover,"This is a pretty good book for anyone on a search for inner-knowing. Up to a point. If you want to take a couple of big steps read 'A Course in Miacles', if you want to take a GIANT leap read 'Seth Speaks' by Jane Roberts."
5,Gain deeper understanding of the Tarot thru a beautiful series of meditations,"Within these two CDs Suzanne has began to share a deeper knowledge of the Tarot and within each card. She brings forth how the Tarot reflects many mysteries of our own personal lives, and brings congruently relationships that occur within the cards themselves.These CD's are very powerful and should not be used while operating a vehicle, these are of course for a meditation not driving.This set is a perfect companion for her recent book ""Integral Tarot: Decoding the Essence"""
5,"the wine critic's choice, by jack smith","This is a must read for anyone who has ever had a glass of wine and wants to see justice upheld over the deliberate workings of media ""experts"" in the paid for review world of wine. Funny, as hell, built on supposed ""fiction"", names et al, however you find yourself filling in the real names, or at least you can best guess.The good guys are really good and the others, as they should be.I loved the fact that the wine ""farmers' have and do live to grow, produce and bring forth their best efforts and along the way they support each others, competitors always, and as the story unfolds, they do indeed take care of business. Lots of fun, lots of insight to the wine world (and life as well). Recommend; hope author goes to the next step; give us another."
1,"236 ideas was inspirational, but not worthwhile for training","This is probably a good book for thoughtful managers who don't know where to start with understanding customer satisfaction. It was not worthwhile for training modules on customer service. It is written in large print - one piece of advice on each page like a book of poetry. ""If you have a high customer turn over rate, you're probably not doing a good job of training your employees"" is the kind of advice you can count on from this book. Would make a nice gift for a new manager, but not practical for me."
4,Great gift at trainings/workshops or for new managers!,"The average manager has no time to read big books. This one can be enjoyed during the ""quiet"" moments to calibrate your mindsetting. The book contains 236 short sentences that each can make you think about your own mind setting and that of your employees. Great tool to come back to the basics of Customer Satisfaction."
4,Funny to me,"I review an item for what it should be, in my opinion. This is a lighthearted comedy with Bob Hope delivering his type of understated lines and Phyllis Diller providing the over the top laughs. If you like other Bob Hope movies then you will like this one as well, if you care more for Jerry Lewis, Jim Carrey type comedy then you probably will be bored with this film."
2,Returned,"Beware! Photo does not allow you to see that you are in the water while lounging. Backrest flimsy. Wasn't stable for 190 lb 6 ft. male, for whom it was a gift. Returned :("
1,float chair,I have bought float chais before but I dont like this one. From the pick itooked like one piecebut it is in two pieces.
3,ehhhh!,"It was alright, it deeply delved into modern bands but failed miserably at any history, beyond bands still appearing. Screaming Jay Hawkins and Hasil Adkins aren't even mentioned. I was happy to see the old guys talking about where and who they played with, but very little was spent on ""older history"""
3,B IS FOR BUDGET- B IS FOR BLOOD CULT,"This is a ""better than agerage"" low budget slasher flick from the mid 80's. The story rervolves around a college town sheriff tracking a ""witch cult"" that keeps killing college students. The sheriff's daughter and the local doctor help him with the case, but are they really helping him at all? There are many leads and twists in this movie that keep you wondering and the end is not what you would expect. You may need to watch it a couple of times to really get it. worth checking out. And I'm not saying that just because it was filmed in my neck of the woods, I've given many a bad movie made here my honest opinion."
1,Worst Movie EVER,The is by far the WORST MOVIE EVER! There is no way one could understand how bad this movie is. If you just need a reference to base all other bad movies on this is the bottom of that list. Please for the Love of Marr do not buy this movie.
2,"Good, clean, wholesome family fun...","Yah... right. Blood Cult was, well, to be kind, an morbidly entertaining film. Nothing spells artist freedom like one girl being beaten to death my a killer wheeleding her friends decaptitated head. Thats quality with a ""K""! Umm.. hmm... Super cheesey death scene's. Poor blood effects. Oh, the Sheriff is classic (right...). Hmm... ok, well thats all the postive things I could come up with. (Note: none of my comments retained to a powerful story line or amazing acting. There is a reason for that.) Now, after all that. I think its safe to say if you rent Blood Cult, you should be slapped with a wet fish."
1,Blood Cult: The Worst Movie Ever Released?,"""Blood Cult"" is no doubt the worst movie that I will ever see out on the video market. However, I cannot allow myself to harp on how bad it is because I realize that the makers of this movie had limited resources. I myself, am a filmmaker who uses a Sony Camcorder. However, I would never in a million years release one of my movies on videotape and expect other people to enjoy it! The acting is horrible, the old sheriff is annoying (he's always eating) the daughter is ugly and fat, the oriental cafeteria cook is, well, i don't know what the hell he is. The one good thing about this movie is probably the kill scenes, and the opening credits, which are not that bad for just a camcorder. Obviously, the worst acted, and most asinine scene in the movie has to be the one that takes place in the cafeteria. Don't waste your money, buy a different quality no-budget movie like ""Ozone."""
1,"Don't buy ""The Iliad!""","Don't be fooled, as I was, by the name ""Best Film and Video Corporation!"" This amateur production is laughable. It looks like a class project put together by high school students in the mass media lab. As a student production, I would give it an A; as a video which I paid good money for, I'm angry that I was taken in."
2,The Escape (VHS),"I've written to the seller twice with no response because I would have preferred a better copy. During the viewing of 'The Escape', pop-ups appeared throughout the film. I would have given the film more stars but the pop-ups were very annoying."
2,Very Little of Sappho Here,"Carman has taken the few fragments of Sappho's poems and filled in considerably with his own imaginings. He has made complete poems out of single lines. They may be beautiful and they may be poetic, but if you're looking for scholarship on Sappho, this is not it."
5,excellent!,"Excellent, excellent, and I don't say this lightly. This film covers the time period AFTER the war. I have traveled throughout the area in which the film took place and it truly captures the gray, cold mood of the area in winter. As the main character, Primo, progresses through his post war disillusion into a semblance of understanding, nature also heals and spring begins. A post Holocaust film which reminds us once again what it means to be human and kind...Not for children."
2,The Truce,This dvd was not very good. Hard to follow and understand what they wanted to say. I would not buy it again. I did like the closed captioning.
3,Hold em book on cash games,This well done book fills a void as most books are for tournament poker.Much of the beginning of book is autobiographical (but interesting).The only disapointment is the included cd is on chip tricks where a betteruse would have been more instruction.
1,Do not read this book.,This is the only book I've read about poker that I haven't liked. The whole book just tells over and over again how good Antonio is at poker.
2,This guys a Donk,There are SOOOOOOOOOO many good poker books on the market today.Your going to buy one from a guy who wears sunglasses while working out in the gym. I'm not saying the book is BAAAAAAAAAAAD it's ok.. barelyYou can do better for your 10 bucks.If your a WPT fan and you like this guy and hear him talk about himself then be my guest :) you won't be dissapointed
3,Narrow scope- doesn't live up to broad claims,"This book promises new information on the assassination, but it basically has nothing new. We all knew about James Tague's cheek wound that occurred during the assassination, he just fills in more detail here. It's somewhat interesting but mainly same old stuff we already know. It's the first book written from this witness' point of view. Finally people can talk about the assassination without dying in mysterious car ""accidents"", so they are, but their memories are half a century old and clouded by 50 years of very real fear."
5,My first favorite book.,The first edition of this book came out in 1954 when I was two years old. My aunts would read the stories to me over and over. I am fifty eight now and still treasure this book. I read it to my children when they were very young and hope to one day read it to my grandchildren.
4,these stories are like candy---give us more!!!,"this was one of my favorite books to read when i was a child. it is a collectionof stories for children like:""the puppy who wanted a boy"",""too many cats"",""the elves and the shoemaker"",""seven at one blow"",""the sleeping beauty"",and somany more. there is also a selection of poems to enjoy and another section of stories. this book is lavishly illustrated with very colorful pictures,some evendecorating the edges of each page. when i was young,i just enjoyed looking at the pictures rather than reading the stories.this is a wonderful addition to any children's library!"
5,Awsome Book!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This book is great. I still have it from when i was little. I'm going to buy another one for my kids to protect the one i have. Great stories and poems. There is a Dr. Suess Story- Marco comes late! A boy named marco is late for school and tells his teacher why he was late, A bird layed an egg on his book! the tale gets bigger.I really loved the pictures alot of faries and elves. i highly recomend Treat shop. If your child loves to read you wont be disapointed. (Even just for the Dr. Suess )There is a great poem about a fariy with a second hand shop It really opens the door to your imagination. This was a text book -One in a series of four! I think boys and girls would equally enjoy this book there id something for everyone!"
5,INSPIRATIONAL,I first saw this air on the Sundance channel. I then went to the producer's website to order it. I cannot recommend this enough to spiritual seekers for inspiration.
3,only OK,"Movie music written by Emerson, excerpts from scores, not music from movies played by Emerson on the piano. American excerpts best, Italian next, and Japanese last. Music for a Godzilla movie? A long way from Brain Salad Surgery or Pirates"
1,Arcane Knowledge,"I got the book out of curiosity. I was somewhat familiar with Sabian Symbols but had not heard of similar work by ""Charubel"" and ""Sepharial"", until an acquaintance mentioned Charubel. I googled around and found this book -- with a bonus! two unrelated Symbol Sets in one book!So far I haven't found ""sufficient evidence of value in these symbolisations"" (quote from page ix in the Preface), but it's interesting reading. Partly because the text is over 100 years old; it's a blast from the past. Would I recommend to someone else? My answer quotes the last sentence on page 47: ""At all events there can be no harm in adding this new (sic) series to the literature of the subject, and in the belief that it may be of some service in the cause of truth, I commend it to the notice of my fellow-students."""
1,Do Not Buy!,"The item description states that this is a combo pack with six colors. Wrong! You will only receive five color cartridges and no black! I contacted customer service three times about this item. First, they sent me only one yellow ink tank. I returned this item and received a replacement order with only five color tanks. I then returned the second order only to receive another replacement order with the same five color tanks and no black. The box the tanks come in clearly states that there are only ""5 pcs."" in box although the site clearly states six(6). I still have no black tank to this day and customer service says they are investigating this item."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT (m),"You will only get 5 tanks, black is not included. Amazon aknowledges the problem, but says it cannot resolve it. They will offer a refund, but I already opened the boxes...they will not send a black tank. I am on my third go around with customer service. The tanks are all slightly different from each other too, for example the yellow and blue have different caps and labeling than the pink and the photo blue. These are definetly second rate, I will only buy Canon ink from now on."
1,If you own all of his previous VHS tapes....,"do not purchase this DVD. There is nothing new on it, it was a waste of money especially if you have previous videos.No one is hatin' if I saw the back cover I would not have ordered it. DUHHHH"
5,best album ever,"the ultimate marriott/lane album. i have all the small faces, humble pie, faces, and solo albums and this is without a doubt my favorite one. what more can i say? if i was stranded on an island for the rest of my life and had to choose one album this would be it. by the way- it was not released until a few years ago because the record company pricks didn't think it would sell back in 79-80."
4,Too short,"This CD is fun in a tongue-and-cheek way, but why couldn't JTQ at least break the forty-minute mark? This disc is over before you know it."
3,High Quality Reissue of two out of print albums,"Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons had a brief fling with national popularity as the Four Lovers in the 1950s, but during the 1960s while recording for Vee Jay and Philips records that the Jersey Boys legend grew. These albums are products of their time and include both the 4 Seasons hits of the 1965 and 1966 period, and a good selection of the 4 Seasons versions of their favorite oldies."
3,True Tintin afficiados must try this Spanish only work,"If you have two to three years of high school Spanish and a good Spanish-English dictionary or a friend that is a native speaker, you can work your way through this work. It is clearly the predecessor to Tintin in America. The style is far less sophisticated than in later works. You might say that this work is the grandfather of all the later works. When Herge wrote this book some of the characterizations would have been perfectly appropriate but now they may either be quaint or offensive depending upon your political views. I'm glad that I bought the book and put in the effort to read it."
3,Actual concertgoer here...,"...it wasn't that fabulous. The crowd was rude and upsetting, and lots of time was focused on this guy in a chicken suit, then he did this like...18 minute song that just was him going ""bop.....bop.....bop....."" I've seen much better, then again, I've seen worse."
3,Ego out of control,"If you would like to witness someone who honestly feels he is God's gift to the world, watch this DVD. This Dave Matthews knockoff with the Donald Trump ego probably e-mails himself to remind him how great he is. Fascinating."
5,A+,The only thing better than this live album is actually seeing Jason live. I love his playfulness and ability to actually SING on this album. Most live albums are rough but Jason is even more amazing here than in the studio.
5,Everyone should own this CD,"I bought this CD a few months ago as an Amazon suggestion when I was buying Gavin DeGraw's CD and I am in love with this man's voice, music, style. If Dave Matthews, John Mayer, Q-tip and James Taylor somehow had a child, Jason Mraz would be it. The lyrics are intelligent and moving, the melodies are catchy yet engaging and his voice is like the juice dripping down your chin from a perfectly ripe pear. This CD and DVD are unbelievably good. Mraz is a real find in an era of nauseatingly bland pop music."
5,So Amazing,I love Jason Mraz. When this album came out i knew i had to get it. Jason Mraz is soo much better live than he is on his studio cd Waiting for my Rocket to Come. His personality comes out through the album and you feel as if he's talking to you. My favorite songs are Sleeping to Dream and After an Afternoon. You NEED to buy this cd its totally amazing!
4,"mraz does it again, this time with mr. popper","first, let me say that i LOVE jason mraz. i have been a fan since the day ""curbside prophet"" came out. i have been looking forward to a realease of a live album ever since i had heard him--but i never expected something THIS good.mraz isn't an ace on the guitar, but he makes up for it by having the smoothest sweet voice, and some amazing guest stars. in ""curbside prophet"" and ""too much food"", JOHN POPPER (yes, of the blues traveler phenomenon) who is INCREDIBLE on the harp, comes out and melts your face off with two incredible harmonica solos. this for me was the saving grace of the album, being an avid harpist myself.some other great songs on this album are ""common pleasure"", ""sleeping to dream"", and ""no stopping us [live]"".enjoy! you won't regreat the purchase if you love jason mraz.and remember, rock out with your c*ck out!"
5,Jason Unfolds,"I would be less enthusiastic about this live set if I had not seen Jason in Coffee House Mode. I've been following Jason and Toca since the days at Java Joe's. So, to me this is like ---""Cool, another incarnation...Why not?"".What I mean is that; I love the core songs. Great, if the songs are presented by a coffeehouse duo or trio. Or, great if you've got horns by the Ohio Players and guests like John Popper.Jason is just one of those people from whom you have such high expectations. Minimally produced or, cranked up with Horns and Egos,you think ---Jeez this kid has IT."
2,No as good,His last two records are much better than this one. Unless you really like Jason music I would not buy this one. One be better off buying the likeble songs thru mp3.
3,Silas Marner gets an update.,"A SIMPLE TWIST OF FATE is a good middleweight movie which doesn't quite go into the top-drawer class because of a few predictable moments and a truly cheapjack ending that doesn't just stretch plausibility but mangles it completely. Steve Martin wrote the script and produced it as well as starred and it's apparent that this was a special project for him. He, Catherine O'Hara, Laura Linney and Gabriel Byrne are all in fine form and Alana Austin just melts your heart away as the Martin character's adopted daughter.If it's not a classic film it's still a good way to spend an hour and forty-five minutes and makes me forgive Steve Martin for SGT. BILKO two years later."
2,Disappointing,"This movie was disappointing, especially since I normally like Steve Martin. The movie had some touching and funny moments, but all in all it was entirely unrealistic, and at times over-dramatic to the point of being corny. There was also a blatant stereotype of wealthy southerners, and the entire legal aspect of the movie was unbelievable to the point of becoming ridiculous. The child actress was noticeably less than convincing.Still, Steve Martin delivers a decent performance, and the film is ""charming"" in a strange sort of way. But this it definitely not a quality film."
2,Please enter a title for your review,"This movie is slow to start (Michael doesn't even meet the kid until 30 minutes in) and doesn't have a very strong narrative. I guess it's obviously more similar in tone to the classic novel it was based on than to what you would reasonably expect from a contemporary film. The real fault that made me feel like the whole thing was just a waste of my time was the incomprehensible ending. (Spoilers Alert?). The skeletal remains of the politicians brother are found with the gold he stole from Michael, and this apparently closes the custody battle, with absolutely no explanation of what possible relevence it has to it. If anyone has an explanation for that ending please post it."
3,"Let's face it, Steve Martin is a hack","As I've said before, I'm a mild Steve Martin fan, but I'm getting tired of his little pretentious efforts at writing.His writing is so blunt and thick sometimes, it's like getting hit with a shovel... not so pleasing. The story is pasted together and the dialogue has an artificial feel. Also, any time a story can be best described as a ""morality tale"", it's going to be boring and obvious. I didn't care to finish the movie. Martin's writing consistently lacks any nuance, cohesion and originality. Passable only as a generic heart tugger this one."
2,LACKLUSTRE CONTEMPORIZATION OF A CLASSIC,"The modern interpretation of morality and guilt is different from George Eliott's times, which is why simply taking a captivating story outside of its context and plopping it down on the 20th century, as Steve Martin's script in ""A Simple Twist of Fate"" does, is bound to end up as an unaffecting effort.Almost every character in the film does things that are inexplicable unless you realize they're living according to the codes and cliches of the last century.Martin is into the skin of his role as usual, sure, especially as the role allows for a little comic relief. Problem is that the comedy simply does not gel with with the drama here. The tone is wobbly at best.'Silas Marner' is certainly worthy of an update; just not a disjointed one like this passable heart-tugger."
3,Interesting Story,"A good story- Steve Martin outside his usual comedy role, but a very sincere and believable character. Movie got squishy with a lot of music and leaps of credibility as the story unfolds. It could have been treated more seriously and would have gotten a 5 star, at least from me."
5,heart-breakingly wonderful,"I am not a person who cries at movies (that's my husband's job) but this film gets me everytime. The young ladies portraying Matilda deserve Oscars - they're simply that good.Heartbreaking, beautiful, poinent (sorry, misspelled). The movie has a simple plot line, but it's told in such a magnicifant way. Others have expressed it better than I can.If anyone ever does find a copy to buy on VHS (let alone DVD) you won't be dissapointed. It's one to hold on to.If you ever need a good cry or to feel sad and hopefull about the world, this is the movie to watch."
3,Excellent entertainment for all ages - no blushing necessary,"A great simple fable, good for all times and ages. If anyone objects to some incongruities, such as the legal details, and such, then they forget that all movies must dispense with some real life restrictions, otherwise we'd never have 'happy endings' or some satisfaction out of some otherwise improbable situation. This movie takes us from one extreme of human condition to the other, and leaves us quite happy at the final (surprise) resolution. Hooray for Steve and the fine cast!"
1,simple twist of fate,the dvd can only be played a certain # of times something about certain reqions? can u send me a replacement?
1,It is a bad tape - it doesn't work.,"The movie we have seen and it's great - however, someone sent us a bogus DVD - it does not play. How disappointing!"
3,Very Sweet,"Flipping channels on cable one day I saw the end of this movie and purchased it. It sat on my self for a while and one day my granddaughter and I were looking for a movie to watch and she chooses this one because she likes Steve Martin, I knew I would like it but my 11 year old granddaughter loved it. And just like all the movies she likes we have watched this film about a dozen times."
5,"Not really games, but still great!","These are not ""games"" like you might imagine. They are simply interesting math problems. It's a great resource!"
2,"no games, few motivating, none exciting; some challenging","I certainly read enough reviews to know I was not ordering a book of math games, but I thought it would be a book of interesting, motivating puzzles and challenges. There are a few of those in that book, but for the most part it is simply a book of practice worksheets on a variety of topics. Some of the worksheets have interesting twists, and a few more have an answer bank that will reveal an acrostic such as ""All your answers are correct,"" but too often a worksheet is simply a list of problems to solve.I would call none of these worksheets games, and less than a third of them puzzles."
3,Case price?,"Sellers here seem to have the going rate for this valve, but for this price you should get a dozen. Or at least an overhaul kit that also includes a replacement gasket."
2,the average music of its time,"This disk doesn't offer a superior music to the average of its time, simply they are pleasant but not very outstanding works, maybe to exception of Dvorak. I consider that the sound of the disk is not very clean, it has some bottom noise, although it is not very annoying. It can be remitted better versions of the piano concerts of Dusek and Dvorak (Richter-Kleiber-Emi)."
3,I don't get it...,"Overall the book is fine. Plenty of interesting projects inside. However, much to my dismay, the step bookshelf pictured on the cover is nowhere to be found inside the book. That was pretty much the reason I purchased the book in the first place... Bait and Switch?!?"
1,I wish I'd seen the previous review.,"Like the guy from Florida, I was enticed by the picture on the cover. But there was nothing like that inside. The contents were much simpler plywood constructions that were far less sophisticated. Bait and switch indeed. This book was not what I wanted. I'm going to send it back."
3,The book is okay,The book was okay but a little disappointing. I will probably use some of the information out of it.
5,"Doo-Wops Greatest Group, No Question!!!","The Earls are the zenith of the 50'sdoo-wop rock groups, every one else tried to copy their vocal street cornerharmony, but these guys are the originals, and in my opinion still a super group sound!"
4,ZEANI RULES,"VIRGINIA ZEANI WAS ONE OF THOSE SOPRANOS WHO LOST OUT TO THE ""BIG NAMES"" ESPECIALLY ON DISC HOWEVER SHE HAD AN ILLUSTRIOUS CAREER ON THE ROAD SHALL WE SAY. A DIVA,PROFESSIONAL ALWAYS, AND A TALENT THAT WOULD RIVAL THE BEST,SHE WAS VIOLETTA.HERE THE ORCHESTRA IS A LITTLE LAZY.THE secondary ROLES ARE ACCEPTABLE BUT PLEASE BUY THIS FOR ZEANI. YOU WILL LOVE HER."
2,"Someone screwed up, Amazon or seller","The CD that was delivered was not the same as the CD that was promised. I was looking for ""The Very Best of Irish Ceili"", and was delivered instead ""The Very Best Collection of Irish Ceili Music"". The CD that was delivered wasnt bad, it just wasnt what I bought, and it did not have one specific song I needed for a dance class for my daughter. Bad job by someone."
5,Chopin a su mayor nivel,"De Abbey Simon se han dicho muchas cosas, pero nadie puede negar que se trata de uno de los pianistas mÃ¡s dotados de los Ãºltimos tiempos. Sus interpretaciones son muy llenas de sentimiento, y hacen que la mÃºsica absorba al escucha de una forma tal que fÃ¡cilmente puede olvidarse de que existe el mundo allÃ¡ afuera. En esta colecciÃ³n de 2 discos, Simon nos presenta los Estudios Op. 10 y 25 de Chopin, asÃ­ como los 19 valses que este compositor produjo a lo largo de su vida. La interpretaciÃ³n resulta fenomenal, y su vesiÃ³n de los valses resulta superior a cualquier otra que haya escuchado anteriormente; si a esto aÃ±adimos un precio increÃ­ble por dos CDs (gracias al sello Vox), esta es una compra segura para quien admire la mÃºsica para piano."
5,Excellent book,"I am so glad that the publishers released this book again. I have seen Tannen speak about the book's content on a video recording of a talk given (I think) at Georgetown. The content is so enlightening; I am convinced that her work could save many a marriage, if studied. I teach conflict management, and I am adding this to my required reading list."
5,Beyond useful!,This book may not be the most exciting read . . . but the information soaks in usefully. It's a great help in not taking personally situations that would have been previously experienced as hurtful and offensive. The information doesn't necessarilly suggest solutions; but it certainly offers a way out of schismogeny.
4,Who is educating who?,"in my opinion, frank is educating rita, as well as rita is educating frank. Rita learns much about literature whereas Frank learns much about life.By the end of the story, rita is more mature and educated of course, and frank becomes more lively and informal."
4,"What in the World? -- a review by Xander, age 9","""Somebody"" has gotten into the Blairs's house. When they get home they'll be surprised to find that the order their house is in is called ""Complete Chaos."" There's tons of mess, the baby's chair is broken, and there's a flood in the bathroom. Who is Somebody?""Somebody's been eating my crunchies!"" This book is a spoof of ""Goldilocks and the Three Bears."" What Somebody does is very humorous and not very realistic. The pictures are very cute, and so is what Baby Blair says, such as ""Feeda ducks!"" This is a funny book for kids age three to five."
4,A Bear Getaway,"Here's a modern take on the traditional tale of the Three Bears. There's only one bear in this story, a cute cub named Somebody who invades what appears to be a two story brick colonial owned by the Blair family, Mother, Father, and Baby Blair. The bear samples thing in threes, food, chairs, closets, plumbing, and of course beds.The best part of the book is the return of the Blairs who find their home in cyclonic chaos. Baby Blair is amused by each discovery and his comments are dead on. Kids like stories that don't follow the rules like this one that doesn't follow the tried and true Three Bears formula. A good oral reader, especially one who likes doing voices, could have lots of fun with this book.The little bear's name is Somebody, a recurring joke used by the writer. The device reminds me of the Odyssey in which Ulysses tells the Cyclops that his name is Nobody, a funny turn when the blinded Cyclops tells his buddies that Nobody has blinded him."
4,A good read - keeps you interested!,Good book - started out a little slow perhaps but by the end I couldn't wait to find out what happened and put it all together!
5,A great humanists story - a great film,This film talks to the hearts of human beings -what ever creed of life
1,Scared for the future,"In addition to being painfully terrible, unrealistic, and slow, this movie's constant use of yellow-billed shrike song in addition to the house sparrow is obviously ridiculous, considering how far south of that bird's range it takes place. Seriously?"
1,Pretty terrible,The four of us live in South Africa and found this movie pretty much unwatchable. Truly an awful film. It will ruin your night.Probably the worst thing ever to happen to South Africa tourism.
1,"Cry, My Beloved Sunday Night","Soul wrenchingly terrible. The entire cast and crew should be ashamed. Please don't ever watch this movie. If I provide no other service in my short time on this planet, I will die a happy man if I stop just one person from watching this complete piece of garbage."
1,Do not watch this movie,"I have made several poor decisions in my life, watching this movie now tops the list. Please take my advice and use the 106 minutes you were going to use to watch this movie and do literally anything else. Have I made myself clear? Do not waste your time on this."
1,Cry the beloved country,"This video was just opened for use in the classroom on 2/14/13. The video is damaged and would not play. Unfortunately, we are past our return date. What a waste. I will be very hesitate to purchase videoes from you in the future.Cry the Beloved Country"
4,"Very good movie, but read the book first.","Great performance by James Earl Jones. I bought the movie to compare with the book for extra credit in my college english class. While the book has more details and character development, I did enjoy the movie just as much. I would recommend this movie to anyone wanting a good history lesson on the struggle of Africa.The way they speak is straight out of the book, so to help you I'll just say, Umfundisi is a priest. Umzana is a word of respect like Sir. Go well, and stay well are their way of saying have a good day, or see you later.The distance Stephen Kumalo travels to Johannesburg and surrounding towns takes DAYS. It's not a 2 hr. train ride. This man lamented over finding his son.The end of the movie is not accurate with the book so much. It should have ended at DAWN, not the middle of the day as portrayed in the movie, but thats ok. I still liked it."
5,"Cry, the Beloved Country - VHS",This movie was based on how a preacher suffered with many family problems and how he kept his faith and held on to his faith and he was rewarded in the end. It was one of the best drama's I have ever seen.
3,Way too short.,"I ordered this as a complement to my Mazda Miata car cover. Its nicely built. However, the problem is it's way too short to reach from one side of the car to the other, so I guess I'll use it for something else."
1,Doesn't fit,Doesn't fit my 2013 Mustang with a Classic Accessories 10-014-261001-00 OverDrive Polypro 3 Charcoal Full Size Sedan Car Cover. Its got to be at least 6 inches too short. I'm not really sure what kind of car and car cover this is supposed to go with.
3,lacking...,the cable is extremely thin and it is too short to double under car. ended up needing two and simply put it thru the tire spokes. not ideal but it does seem to be a quality product.
3,car cable and lock,"Cable and lock are working fine. There should have been two locks with the set. I had to use another lock,of which is a better quality then the one with the set. It takes two locks to secure the cable to the car cover."
4,Underappreciated Album,"Fans of Marcus Miller style bass playing will love this album. His remake of Jaco's Opus Pokus ( and it's much faster, giving it a whole new groove ) is very cool, as well as the great harmonics and Stanley Clarke style playing on Acid Jazz Bass - these two alone are worth the purchase of this cd but there's a lot more here. Very similiar to Marcus Miller's most recent cds with a bass playing style very similiar, the songs are mixed with instrumentals/ some vocals with music/ and small interjections of acapella. Guest artists on this include Gil Scott Heron, Simon Bartholomew and The Brand New Heavies Horn Section, Nick Van Gelder from Jamiroquai, Pablo Cook, and Max Beesley Jr. Any bass player or fan of modern jazz will love this album"
3,Beautiful & Informative...but a little slow.,"The idea of sightseeing in America's National Parks through the marvelous picture and sound of DVD is reason enough to be interested in a release like this. However, ""Touring Through Great National Parks of America, Vol. 2,"" is a tad rough around the edges.While the picture quality is above average, it is not spectacular, and the sound tends to be a little muffled in the voice over. But, on the other end, it's hard not to be won over by the sheer beauty of parks like Shenandoah, Yosemite, Yellowstone, and Zion, among others. The commentary is well researched and in depth, but also tends to be a bit slow at times.Overall, this DVD will delight frequent visitors to America's National Parks, serving as a postcard reminder of their magnificence. In addition, anyone interested in visiting some of America's National Parks will want to give this a try to help decide which one might be right for you.Not a perfect DVD, but informative none-the-less."
2,the instructions for this product are over ambitious.,The instructions for this product are over ambitious. I basically wasn't even able to make a simple mozzarella. The milk never curdles as much as it seems it should. Perhaps the company needs to update the recipes.
4,Junket Rennet,"I purchased this item for cheesemaking. It works well, and makes the cheesemaking projects rewarding and successful. It arrived quickly and has instructions for cheesemaking, icecream making and puddings."
1,Soup,"Tried 3 times and the milk never set. Tested three different milk types, all full fat and not ultra-pasteurized.Maybe the date expired .. but I only saw a weird 4 digit code on top that was 2386."
1,Very Disappointed,It took three times the number of tablets that were called for in the recipe. Unfortunately I did not check the expiration date on the box before I started using the rennet. They were past the expected shelf life.
3,Re review,I have already reviewed this product. I stated that I felt the product mayhave had some extreme heat changes in shipment (not the vendors fault) as it did not work.
1,"Received as advertised, but SLOW shipping.","I placed an order for 1 box of Junket Rennet tablets on July 9th and received it yesterday (July 16th). In the meantime, I visited the manufacturer's website and placed and additional order for 6 boxes of rennet (each box at less than half the price of the box I ordered here) on July 11th and received it on July 14th. Incredibly slow shipping in my opinion, and my one tiny box of rennet arrived in a box intended for an entire case of the product filled the rest of the way with paper, which was a waste of packaging and environmentally unfriendly. In the future, I'll just order directly from Junket."
2,not working for me,"I don't know if this review is for the Junkets or for the seller. These tablets do not work for me. I have tried with different milks, I added calcium to the milk, I inoculated one hour before, I inoculated and renneted overnight. All around, impossible to obtain a clean break the way Fankhauser describes. I gave up on junkets, and I ordered Austrian Bio Ren and Fromasin, also from Europe. Maybe this is a bad batch, the box is stamped 12 08 - it is now sept 2011-and I do not know what that means. Gave 2 stars since includes a nice booklet with recipes, but these Junkets are junk."
5,Kitchen Update,Just what the Dr. ordered. Just as advertised. Great update to the kitchen. Kitchen got an update with with new counter tops and dishwasher. Thanks.
2,The poorest of the series,This is the least of the Death Gate novels. Its story really has little to do with the grand plot. I almost hurled the book across the room when Zifnab (really the wizard Fizban from their flawed Dragonlance books) appeared and started spouting silly references to our own time. This silly comic relief truly spoils whatever tension was building up.
5,Damn people with ADD,"Many people who read this tend to think that it was very slow at the beginning but better at the end. I thought it was great all the way through, there was plenty of ""action"" throughout. Of course, not bone crushing kill kill kill action. I also think that Fizban added a great comic relief, not that the intro was that serious. The series and everybook in it is great."
5,Book was in readable condition,"I love it, I love this series. I just wanted a cheap copy that I could add to my collection since I lost this series years ago."
3,"Enjoyable, but not Totally Satisfying","I enjoyed the second book of the Death Gate Cycle, but it felt weak in parts, and there was no real clarity about whether this world exists in our future, or if this is some different potential reality wave, or if the universe is a multiverse where every potential reality wave actually exists (I promise I'm not spoiling, our world/reality gets mentioned extremely early). I get that this is a minor quibble, but when a character starts frequently mentioning our actual history/present, it takes me out of the story a bit when the reason for it is left completely unexplained. I'm not sure if that was my biggest problem, but it's the one that stuck with me the longest. Overall though, it was a pretty fast read, and built well on the first book of the series."
4,"Marvelous, but...","This is the second greatest fantasy-series I've ever read. This book, like the previous, holds a very high class. The only remark I want to do is about this magician Zifnab. Although his comments can be witty and sometimes even a bit funny he tends to drag the concept of the series down by referring to present time and Tolkien."
3,Good read,"I read this a long time ago, maybe about 8 years or more now. Bought it because I'm still trying to obtain the whole series.Can't say much except I continued reading the series after this second volume so I'm guessing it must have been decent.This review might not help anyone though."
5,Gotta read it!!,"I'm a starter in the Fantasy genre, and let me tell you, this is a pretty good welcome home party! I haven't read the first one in the Death Gate Cycle yet, but the author does a good job of filling an amature in. You don't even have to read the first four books in order! I really enjoyed this book, and I suggest it to both green-backs and seasoned veterans in this field"
2,This movie is Garbage!,"This should have never been released in the chessboxing collection. It is a fantsy filled story, with power ranger like attributes. Mark long and Jack long were in the movie for short periods, if that was even them, and they didnt' even face off. a dull, repetative film, that i wouldn't really recomend to any one over the age of 10."
5,I have been waiting for this cd a long time.,"Ever since the 70's I have been a fan of Dick Campbell. His album Dick Campbell Sings Where It's At just blew me away, and this album, if possible, is even better. I bought several copies to give to my friends. If us fans of great music and magical lyrics are lucky, then they will realease more Dick Campbell material on cd. Remember, music legends never die as long as their music still touches our hearts."
4,ZEANI FOREVER,ZEANI CAN DO NO WRONG. SHE EMBODIED FLORIA TOSCA.UNDERRATED. MISSED THE BOAT ON THE GREAT RECORDING LABELS BUT HAD MORE TALENT AND PASSION THAN MANY. GET IT FOR HER. HER BACKUP IS JUST FINE. HONEST AND TRUE.
3,still a good read... but disappointing,"Everything's relative, but compared to _Midnight's Children_ and _Satanic Verses_ Rushdie's novel about Pakistan left me a bit dubious of my distinction of him as an unwavering literary superstar. I always enjoy his writing style, but I wonder if his strict political satire of the ruling classes in _Shame_ is as powerful as the epic parody in _MC_. This novel just appeared a bit more of a closed text with such seemingly visible agendas that I wondered to what extent crossing the fictional borders of countries could affect someone's writing."
5,Pakistan - Myth and Disillusion,"If Salman Rushdie had written only this book, he would be remembered. Unfortunately, his reputation is colored by extra-literary considerations. I guess a Fatwah will do that.Another cloud over the success of this novel is the brilliance of the author's previous book ""Midnight's Children."" Both texts mythologize a country - its history and culture. However, while ""Midnight"" is about India, ""Shame"" is about Pakistan. While the previous book's best insights are political, the former tome offers a unique look into the heart of religion - namely, Islam.So there are certainly similarities between the two books, but ""Shame"" holds its own admirably. From the first sentence, you know you're in the hands of a master. While this may not be the best point to enter the author's uniqiue world, it's a wonderful place to continue the journey."
4,Interesting and intriguing,"Shame is the third novel by Salman Rushdie. The narrator tells us novel is and is not about Pakistan. The main characters are Omar Khayyam Shakil (who represents shamelessness), Raza Hyder (read Zia-ul-Haq), his daughter Sufiya Zinobia (who represents shame), Iskander Harappa (read Zulfikar Ali Bhutto) and his daughter Arjumand Harappa, the virgin Ironpants (read Benazir Bhutto). Once again written in magical realism, the plot loosely follows events leading up to the reign of Bhutto and then the coup by Zia. A political novel, it sent me off to Wikipaedia to fill in my sorely-lacking background knowledge of these events in Pakistan. Not the epic length of Midnight's children or of later novels, it is filled with satire, cynical intrigue and black comedy. Rushdie, as always, demonstrates his mastery of language and keeps the reader engaged to the last line."
1,really??????,"this is one of the absolutely worst books I've EVER read!! Shame on the folks who gave it a good or even decent review!. It was painful...each sentence....each paragraph...each chapter was spent asking myself ""really???? when is this actually going to get good????""...until I realized it wasn't capable of getting good. I cut my losses, mourned the time and money I wasted on this book, and decided to never read a Rushdie book again. If this review saves one person from making the mistake I made and purchasing this book, then it was well worth typing:) Go forth and spend your hard-earned money on something worthwhile."
1,laxative cookies,"Don't order these unless you need a laxative! These cookies contain the sweetener ""maltitol"" which has a laxative effect. THAT'S WITH ONE COOKIE! This should have been stated with the nutrition facts on the box. The canister type container of Jennie's Brand macaroons is wonderful!This BIG box contained 10 quarter-sized cookies, too. I wouldn't have really wanted more after it's effect on my system, but for the price....."
1,False advertising. Each cookie has 13g of non-fiber carbs.,"The front of the box and their ads say ""0g Net Carbs"" but the nutritional label says 1g fiber, 1g sugar and 12g sugar alcohols. Eating one of these is the same as eating 13g of sugar for a diabetic. Unless their opinion that the diarrhea that the 12g of maltitol per cookie will give you will cause you to expel the cookie before it has a chance to be digested? P.S. Each of these 70 calorie cookies in miniscule. About the size of your fingertip."
5,Classic,Jay Brandon is the man... and I've only read one of his books. Cool cat - good courtroom stuff. Excellent. Wicked. Aiiie! Boo yah!
2,Local Fools,"I can't write little enough about this book, it all sounds like bull to me. This book made me take the next day off work sick it was so bad. A real page-sticker. Recommended to people with bad eye-sight and bad hearing with mimimal interaction with other people. Jay Brandon could ruin your life like he has ruined mine.All that said I would still rather read this than talk to anyonre in my hostel, the USA Hostel in San Francisco."
5,Handling the Cerebral Palsied Child at Home,"I consider this book a classic on the subject of, as the title suggests, handling the young cerebral palsied at home. It gives information on physiotherapy, occupational therapy ,speech therapy and how to best apply these methods in the child's own home. The illustrations are well drawn and the book is very well written in clear, easy to understand language. This book is a must for all parents of young children with cerebral palsy."
5,My first Tosca,"I saw this as a teen about 1960. I became an instant Corelli fan and was lucky enough to see him live in Tosca about 8 years later with the famous, glorious, ""Vittoria"" that seemed to go around the world and back. Never have I been in an audience so dumbstruck. That particular performance I was delighted to find on cd and its even better than the famous Parma.Back to the dvd. The quality is tolerable. Filming in the actual locations is quite exciting. The worst thing is Caniglia's singing....pretty screechy. But Duval's acting compensates. Our Scarpia is far too mellow (I have yet to find one mean enough). For the era, this was a great effort, far eclipsing other filmed operas of the time."
5,Haven't found a Tosca to top it yet!,"This production of Tosca, with Franco Corelli as Cavadarosi was the second opera I had ever seen. But in reality, for me, it will always count as the first...as this opera led to my full on opera obsession. The greatness of Corelli in this role cannot be overstated. And the production is perfect; beautiful and atmospheric without being a distraction.Puccini's Tosca is one of my favorite opera's, and that has much to do with this version. I have watched at least five other productions, and none have come close for me. I will admit, the sound and picture quality are not great, and leave much to be desired when compared to more recent Tosca's. However, the quality of the singing and acting is awesome, a true piece of operatic history!"
4,Great for the most part,"Covers the phone and does what a case should do. Includes a belt clip that's pretty nifty. My only complaint is that the edges of the case irritate my ears. I guess it forces you to not place your ears close to the phone. The buttons are still easily accessible and you can still feel them, unlike the verizon case I used earlier [ Verizon case is nearly identical, just with different texture ]. Probably still the best case out for the razr. Also, it's not a tight fit like others are saying, there is some slack - not to much to annoy you or anything. And the thing about the charger is somewhat true. i find myself sliding the case up sometimes so that it fits nicely in place. I've tried adjusting the case so that i wouldn't have to do it, but no luck thus far.If your in the market for a case, this is a good one compared to what else is out there."
5,Body Glove Scuba II Case for Motorola RAZR V3 - Black / Silver,"I just got this case and it works just fine. At first I thought the clip was to hard to release but once worked in it works just fine. Mine covers the Razor perfectly....One small word of caution is to clean the case window before putting it on, they were dusty from sitting around Best Buy(BB will price match Amazon so I did not have to wait for it.As far as the guy that did not like the belt clip...it seperates off leaving just a small nub to use to connect it back to the belt clip.Overall I like the look and feel...skin has traction so the Razor is not as slippery and I like this"
3,Go for it,"It has a great look and give a good protection to the phones, the only problem,is difficult to charge the phone with the case on, it keeps on loosing contact because the hole is too small and the material too thick."
3,Not for my MOTORAZR2 V9x,The design is amazing and the quality is excellent but I was wrong when thought that it will protect my MOTORAZR2 V9x. It's small for my phone. what a pity !
3,Just an average case,Nothing special. An average protection tool. Only thing I changed was the swivel clip. The supplied clip was cheap in design and construction and the placement of the release makes removal difficult.
1,BODY GLOVE KNOCK OFF JUNK!,THE SELLER OF THIS PRODUCT SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF HIMSELF FOR SELLING THIS PLASTIC JUNK. I HAVE BOUGHT BODYGLOVE PRODUCTS FROM MY LOCAL REATALERS AND THE QUALITY WAS EXCELLENT COMPARED TO THE PRODUCTS I PURCHASED FROM THIS SELLER ON AMAZON. BUYER BEWARE OF THIS SELLER
3,It's OK,"I needed to get a case for my cell phone but did not want a monster on the side of my hip. Body Glove makes slim products and they hold up well... so when I saw the product I thought it was perfect.I have had the item for a little over a week and it has been helpful. While driving I clip the item on my visor, Bluetooth are attached easily, and the cover protects the inside and outside nicely...well worth the cost."
3,Stitching Comes Apart...,"***NOTE: This includes the same model being sold at Wal-Mart stores.******This is the same product as this model case.************************I am currently on my third (and final) Body Glove case for my Motorola Razr V3. The case itself is great as far as quality, fit and everyday use and comfort. That is why I bought it again after my first two had the stitches come apart on them. That is the major problem. It works fine for a while then, on the side where the charger plugs in, you will notice the bottom stitches will start to come apart. I absolutely refuse to give them anymore money though for a fourth case.TIP: Here is what I did when my third case's stitches started coming apart. I bought the $2.00 travel sewing kit and sewed the hell out of it. So far, my stitches have held it together. So I recommend sewing that smallest connection below the charger port. Other than that, I have had no problems with the case."
4,Body Glove Scuba Case for RAZR V3,"This case is very useful and fits my phone like it states - a body glove. The only negative thing about it is that the plastic piece covering the numbers is a little lower than it should be. The numbers 1,2 and 3 are not covered by the plastic and it tends to slip down when using. Otherwise, it protects my phone and was a great price."
2,So-So product,"Looks great, feels great. However, it continues to ""slip""...therfore, it covers the ear piece, as well as the charging area. I'm too busy in life the adjust the case for every use!"
3,Body Glove Razr Case,"The case loosened over time and slides up on the phone, which makes it hard to hear conversations. I like the way it looks and protects the phone, but sometime it's not worth having the case on it. It's okay, but next time I'll get a more flexible case"
3,GARBAGE! 0 stars,"Absolutely useless! The day after I wrote the review below, the phone caught on the annoying nub, mentioned by others,flung out of my pocket and landed on none other than, you guessed it, the unprotected corner. TOTAL TRASH!!!!!! DO NOT BUY!Originial review: I like the case. It looks nice and seems well made. As mentioned the phone does not close all the way, but it is very very close and not bothersome. Slightly more annoying and true is that the charger plug in hole is not big enough for the charger. You have to slide the case off every time or the plug won't stay in. One little thing too is that the corners of the phone are exposed, the case just does not cover them..."
1,Your case will not look like the photo !,"Fellows has changed the look of this and it has a large glove icon on the front of it instead of the Body Glove text. A sad replacement in my view. I've complained to Amazon, Body Glove, Webtero, and Fellows and they still show the wrong image of what you will get in the mail. That's false advertisement in my book."
3,not for keeping clean!,"seemed like a good case for my husband (who works in construction), but the plastic that goes on the inside doesn't cover the keypad and the screen all the way, which is what he was looking for. dust and debris kept getting in between the case and the phone, so he eventually took it off, bought a case that fits on his belt and keeps the phone covered. He has to take it out every time he uses it, but phone stays clean. this is not for someone who has a ""blue collar"" job, plus the clip on the back of the phone was really chintzy, like it would break easily."
3,Not the greatest fitting cover..,"For some reason, this Scuba II Case did not fit my Razr V3 phone very well. I'm not sure if it was because I have the Pink phone or not, but it does not quite line up correctly for the charger terminal and it does not close completely without having to squeeze it. I ordered the new pink case, hopefully that one will fit better."
5,Great fit for a great phone!!,"I bought this product not knowing what I got into, but it was worth the risk!! It's fits PERFECTLY on the Razr and it keeps it clean on both the inside and outside screens!! I have no complaints about it and I HIGHLY RECOMMEND that you get this if you get or already have a Razr!!!!!!"
3,Works great for me,"Personally, I love it. It protects my phone without ruining the slim profile.The reviewer who mentioned about the release mechanism is right in one sense, the release is on the bottom instead of the top.Frankly, I think the rest of the complaints are meaningless. The case looks good, it protects the phone well and does not ruin the profile.As to the guy who complained the phone does not close flush, NO case will allow that. Because of he natur of what goes over it. Get a plastic carrying case for $6 then you can have it close flush"
4,Fits (almost) like a glove!,"I own 2 of these and always get comps on them. I think these should become standard issue with each phone sold, sinc ethey do wonders to beautify and protect. Should last for years."
3,ok,I like the leather coverage. The clip on the back is plastic though and does not have a spring. I don't think it will last long. I have had mine since Christmas.
2,Poor quality control,"I like the looks of the case and it actually fits well. The problem is the stitching is coming undone even before I put it on my phone. The cost of sending it back isn't worth it, the hazards of buying online I guess.Very poor quality control, but that's what we seem to get from goods made on the ""cheap"" from China."
2,Not as good as the Motorola case,"In the past, I have purchased the Body Glove Cases for other flip phones. However, this one for the Razr is not good. It is a struggle to even get it on the phone and the openings for the charger, earpiece etc do not line up properly. My husband did complain about the clip and indicated that it released a few times when he sat down. Although I have been a fan of their cell phone cases in the past, I am disappointed in this one. We have replaced it with the Motorola brand leather case."
3,functional,"Product seems to be OK. As for probelms others have had, well chalk it up to internet buying. The clip is stiff and not easily accessible, but is does work. After having the piece for a while now, the lining is coming off on the ""straps"" across the top. I can deal with it since it was not very expensive, but it makes me think this is actually a knock-off or clone to a body glove. Probably 90% of these products are such since they are cheaper than the shipping. Amazon should be a little more choosy about the vendors they use."
2,I wanted this to work,"I bought this as a case for my new razr phone. What I got was disappointing, and I ended up throwing it away. I tried to like it.Pros:It does protect your phoneKept it relatively sleekCons:1The bottom part of the case did not fit snugly, and therefor covered the A/C adapter/charger spot.2The belt clip was very hard to remove on and off3There was lots of slack on the back when the phone was opened4The button that holds the top/bottom peices together came undone alot.5The plastic over the screen was not attached to anything, it just flapped there and stuck onto the screen itself, creating bubbles underneath that made it ugly and hard to read in some lighting conditions.Overall, I wanted to find a case that was as sleek and worked as good as my Razr phone. For such an advanced phone, this case was stone age."
5,Perfect for Grandchildren,WE bought this book for our Granddaughter and she loved it. It is a fun way to introduce her to part of her cultural heritage and the fact it was a gift from her Hal Moni was just icing on the cake.
1,don't buy it !,Do waste your time ! They dont package it rightand it's chipped all over. Plus the base is notenamel on the outside.
1,Not Worth the Money,"I ordered one of these steamers, and when it arrived the enamel on the lid was chipped in five places, the base had three enamel chips. I exchanged it and the second steamer arrived with two enamel chips on the lid and a chip on the base. When I lifted the base out of the packaging box, the base cut my right thumb on the chipped enamel edge. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY ON THIS ITEM. MOVE ON TO THE NEXT STEAMER!!!"
1,Horrible quality. The enamel was applied very sloppily and peeled off in my hands without any water being applied.,"This product was very poorly manufactured. The description wasn't accurate, and the price was outrageous for the lack of quality. I returned it immediately."
1,A DIABOLICAL SERVICE!!!,"I recieved the steamer quite quickly but the lid was damaged, i was sent a replacement and would you believe it NO ONE had checked to make sure it was okay, this ones lid was chipped in numerous places, the dish was chipped inside too and when i took it out of the box it hadn't even been glazed on the outside!!WHERE IS THE THEIR QUALITY CONTROLLERThey obviously don't have one.You would have thought that sending a product such a long way and it being a replacement that someone should have made sure it was perfect, would't you??"
3,looks good works great,It took a long time to arrive. When it did arrive it was without the lattice top. It took another two weeks for that to arrive.
1,Deceptiive AD,This ad lists a Conair WJT4BCR Interplak 4 Piece Water Jet Tips (Pack of 6). The WJT4BCR is a placement tip set in one blister pack. The says that you receive a pack of six which I would assume from the ad wording I would receive 6 blister packs of tips. This merchant price was higher then other merchants selling the same product as a single 4 pack. It would have been a very good price for 6 of that item and that is why I paid the higher price and boughtthe item from them. What I actually received was ONE WJT4BCR tip set and 2 Hairbrushes. The AD did not mention hair brushes.Stay away from this merchant with their deceptive ADS!
3,"Great characters, slow plot","This is the middle book in a trilogy, and it shows. I love the characters. They are each unique, and yet they have formed a solid friendship and partnership. I also enjoy the humor in the novel.But the plot develops slowly and just doesn't have the payoff one would hope for. (This continues into the third book, unfortunately. The first book in the trilogy is the best for plot.)Everything about their cunning plan is just slightly off. It requires too many different people to agree to too many different things that really don't seem beneficial to them. It develops too slowly. And it's too predictable to be dramatic.All in all I liked the book a lot. But that's entirely because of the characters and the whimsy. It definitely suffers from ""middle book syndrome""."
3,A little less than I expected,"Tasted more like weak coffee. It is ""ok"" but wont replace starbucks any time soon. use 1/2 the water they recommend and it is passable"
5,Great Coffee,I love this coffee! It is easy to make and very good. If you like stronger Cappuccino (like the stuff at Starbuck's) you may not care for this because it isn't that strong. I love the individual packs because I can take it to work. It was easy to order from Amazon and the price was good.
5,Perfect pick-me-up,"For someone like me with a limited tolerance to caffeine, the 100 Calorie Pack of General Foods International Cappuccino ~ Cafe' Mocha is perfect. And at $.38 a serving (two case purchase at Amazon) it is economical. Great taste and couldn't be more convenient."
5,I loathe General Foods,OMG!! Why can't General Foods keep the Mocha Cappuccino in Stock!! What the He.. is the problem!!
1,Capuccino Nestle Cacao,"Taste excactly like Nestle cacao. In europe jacobs and other companies make individual pocket coffee that are taste like real Capuccino. Waste of time and money, this so called Capuccino ruined my breakfast, and now I really have to think what to do with those 6 boxes. Zero stars."
5,"general foods international coffees cappucino, cafe mocha",this product is excellent. If you like a smooth mild coffee drink try this one. My husband is now hooked so we will be buying more later.
1,Never got what I ordered,"The product offered is a package of 12 boxes. I received one box for the price of 12, When I complained to customer service they tried again and the same thing happened again. After the second time they told me that they just wouldn't be able to get the order straight. What's wrong with this picture?"
3,Rub a dub,Not a bad album tho can be numbing after few listenings. Gotta really be into dub or ganja to keep playing this one.
3,A little slow...,Okay video for a cheap rental... Comedy is definitely not Stallone's strong point. If I had more time I would have kept looking for something else.
5,Oscar,One of Stalones best movies. A great comic spoof about the mob. The casting is excellent. Good for all ages.
5,Great for a laugh,"I have just purchased my 2nd copy of this, as we've worn the first one out. It's a case of anything that can go wrong on the worst possible day to do it, does. This is by far, one of my favorite all time movies. I'm not a Sly Stallone fan by any means, but he's very good in this. It also helps that he has a great cast with him.Would recommend it to anyone wanting to be pleasantly surprised by a movie."
3,Stallone is Comical!,"A funny Stallone movie that deserves more recognition than it did. I enjoyed this and more people need to see this. Kirk Douglas makes a cameo and it's hysterical. It should be put on DVD and John Landis fans will enjoy this quirky, gangster comedy."
5,Love It!!!!,I've always loved this movie and I'm glad to see it's available to at least rent although i would love to buy it. It is funny and stylish. The actors do a great job at capturing that 1930's movie cliche of a mobster. Great movie!
4,Good Movies,This is a movie I have always liked and I got it here for a great price. The shipping time was extrordinary. I had it days before I expected it.
4,Sylvester Stallone does comedy?!,"Sylvester Stallone plays a gangster that tries to go straight, keeping a promise he makes to his father (Kirk Douglas). Based on a play, the interaction flies well, and Stallone has some rather amusing moments. It's a good show the first time, but by no means something you'll watch over and over. Features a solid supporting cast in addition to Douglas: Marisa Tomei plays Stallone's spoiled, rebellious daughter. Vincent Spano is Stallone's self-interested accountant, while Peter Reigert and Chazz Palminteri are amusing as Stallone's bodyguards. And Tim Curry is hilarious as Dr. Poole, Stallone's linguistics teacher. Also watch for cameos from Don Ameche, Arleen Sorkin, and Yvonne De Carlo. END"
2,"Great movie, Garbge DVD","Before I get slammed for such a low rating, let me explain.This is one of my all-time Top Five Favorite Comedies. I can watch it at any time, and know I'm going to laugh. The jokes are witty and quick, reminding me of the Marx Brothers films. It's 109 minutes of rapid-fire jokes that actually took intelligence to write. Comedy like this is so rare in today's infatuation with gross-out humor (i.e, anything by the no-talent Seth Rogan).That being said, the DVD release is a joke. It has the film, the trailer, and nothing else. With such a stellar cast of funny people, nobody could even find a blooper/gag reel? Seriously? No commentary? No deleted scenes? Not even a reference to the original French film?NOTHING! This DVD is one of the worst ever realeased. I had hoped there would be a 20th Anniversary release (in 2011) which included all this stuff. Sadly, it didn't happen. I, and many others, can only hope that the Blu-Ray release isn't so disappointing."
5,Searching for Oscar,"This is an absolute feel good movie. It's entertaining from end to end, and shows a side of Sylvester Stalone most of us would never believe existed. My mother-in-law used to borrow my copy all the time. When I divorced, I lost it. I found that it never made it home with me. I love how I feel watching this movie and am desperate to replace it. I've been searching a long time. It's good clean fun great to watch with parents and children, enjoyed by all. Please help me replace mine."
3,"Oscar is no oscar worthy, but it is really good","I really liked this movie. It's one of those delightful surprises in that I really didn't expect to like this movie, but when it was over I wanted to watch it again. Here's a few thoughts about it1. The cast is great! Sly Stallone really surprised me in this comedic role as a gangster that he played wonderfully well. Dom Ameche plays a priest in this movie in what has to be one of the last roles he played before he died. Marisa Tomei is in this before she won the real oscar and became famous, and the supporting cast is a list only.2. If you love plot twists that will keep you guessing, this is a great movie.Pick up this great comedy at a great price and add it to your collection"
5,Keeps you laughing,"I'll admit, I've loaned my copy to people who just don't seem to ""get it"", but I'm happy to see by the multitude of reviews that I am not mistaken - this movie is really funny! With an overtone of a ""who's on first routine"" and no shortage of witty one-liners it is a great movie with a wonderful cast! You will want to pay attention - you don't want to miss a line or you may miss a great joke later."
4,This is the first movie...,"... where I literally fell off the sofa laughing. Classical comic timing, the exploitation of stereotypes for comic effect (instead of because the writers were too lazy to think up something original), great sight-gags, and an hilarious ""who's-got-what"" running joke.Only downside: no special features on the DVD..."
5,Funny movie,Lots of memorable quotes. Light humor with no profanity. Fun family movie as long as the kids are a little older
3,An offer you could refuse but maybe shouldn't,Basically Oscar is an opportunity to watch some actors that you like mess around. It is not exactly funny but the movie is definitely fun and very light-hearted. Recommended if that is enough for you.
5,"Great ""who's on first "" type comedy","I was ecstatic to.find this movie.on amazon. Its a great comedy that really didn't get the respect it deserved. Great cast and plot, definitely worth a watch."
5,Funnier than most BIG comedies!,"I first saw this movie when I was 8 or 9, and now I'm 20, but it's STILL one of the best comedic movies I've ever seen (and I've seen a lot of movies). How it never became a huge hit is beyond me (lack of promotion maybe?) I fully recommend buying this, even if you've never seen it and are just curious, after your first viewing it'll be an instant favorite."
2,Mike Hebron,"If this is your first Hebron book, then if may be okay to read it. However, if you've read or watched his videos before, then this book is a waste of time. There is nothing significantly new. It's just a repeat of the things you have heard him say before."
3,Battery is a problem,"Our kid loves the mini ipod but sadly the battery died within 3 months and you have to send it back to Apple to get it replaced and it is quite expensive. If I had known this, we would not have purchased it."
3,Meh,"It has a decent capacity, and it plays music, which is all I really care about. The battery does not last, so I always have mine plugged in, but it gets the job done. Also, the backlight has recently worn out. Oh, well."
1,displeased,"I ordered an IPOD from this person that was said to be in like new condition. I was suspicious of the low price and after the item arrived to my house it was not in the condition promised. In fact, it was broken before I even received it. I contacted them for a replacement and they talked to me for a few messages but then started ignoring me. I had to file a claim with Amazon in order to get my money back. Needless to say, it was unwanted and unnecessary stress. I don't suggest buying anything from this person in the future."
1,Apple 6 GB iPod Mini Blue M9803LL/A,It should be a good product but the one I bought only worked for an hour then I bring it to the apple store to get it fixed and they were so nasty about it. They were going to give me a Reconditioned one to replace my new one. You got to be kidding me. NO more ipod they suck.
2,Pump is awful,"The pump that comes with the unit is awful. The noise coming from it can be heard over the engine and the radio at a low volume, not to mention the static that it sends through the speakers. The strainer, meter, and the gasket are all fine. Anyone looking at this unit should buy the sending unit by itself and get a good aftermarket pump."
1,hardware the movie ??,"horrible video, loved the movie on vhs was hoping the DVD would be better,looked like bootleg theatre copy"
4,Thrilling ride into low-budget coolness.,"I have watched this movie so often in the past 10 years, that I'm afraid my videotape will wear out (why is this independent gem not on DVD!? Why isn't everthing?) I think it's worth it for the Carl McCoy (Fields of the Nephilim) cameo alone..."
4,Awesome soundtrack on Varese Sarabande,"Entertaining but derivative sci-fi movie. But ... soundtrack by Simon Boswell sets this apart. Very beautiful all the way thru, my personal favorite is the short, erie, almost frightening version of ""Silent Night"" (track 9)."
1,Very Moving,"This one is a tear jerker. I cried because of the money I wasted on the rental and the precious hours lost forever into the abyss of movie-hell. Worst movie I have ever, ever, ever, ever seen."
5,"Great Design, Great Watch","I have several of these Fender watches, and ALL of them are crafted very well, and look toooo COOL! I always get compliments on them. They are very well thought out..."
3,"Good for its time, but pricey at $1849.","Purchased this television new in 2005. Touted as HD upgradeable (whatever that means). This television served well for the past four years, but has been far surpassed by hdtv available today."
1,Anybody have a chainsaw?,You'll need one to cut through this wooden performance. Save your [money] and buy a John Tesh album.
4,Christan novel,"Deborah Anne has the chance of a lifetime to become a backup singer for a big time singer, but she don't plan on letting that lifestlye take away her christanity. Deborah is not used to all the parties, and nasty talk of the others on the tour with her. She also had to deal with her love for Triage, a rapper from her hometown. Can Deborah keep God first, read and fine out."
3,A Blessing,I would have never read the book if it hadn't been a project for school but I am glad I read it. It has a powerfull gospel message and I encourage any singer who is interested in becoming a star to read this book first.
2,Unrealistic,"I'm a singer in a large church choir so when I picked up Singsation I fully expected to read a story I could related to.Instead I thought I was reading Gospel Cinderella.I found it unrealistic and boring, with a predictable fairy tale ending."
4,So Refreshing,"""SINGSATION"" was a joy to read. Jacquelin did an excellent job in writing a Christian fiction novel that flowed so well and was very entertaining without a need to use vulgarity or write explicit sexsual scenes. The story line portrayed characters involved in life situations; however, she did excellent in keeping this novel with a religious flair. It was just refreshing to read a novel of this kind. I'm looking forward to her next novel. Keep up the good work Jacquelin!!!!!"
4,excellent read,I enjoyed the book singsation. Many christian young people who are talented are ofted faced with the opportunity to sing secular music. Ms. thomas does a good job of telling Deborah anne's story. I look forward to reading more of her work.
4,Great storyline,"Jacquelin, you are a creative writer and this story has the making of more great book from you mind. I truly enjoyed this one and can't wait to read more from you."
3,Good book,"It was a great book. It showed a peek of the life of a Gospel group behind the scene. It was very shocking. Jacqueline usually has good books. This one was not my favorite. But, it was ok."
4,To God be the Glory!,"I listened to the audio version of Singsation and felt like I was watching at a movie. It was entertaining, yet had a message that any Christian could appreciate when trying to determine how to use a gift or talent God has given them, yet glorify Him at the same time. Throughout my `listening' I just KNEW Deborah was going to slip up while she was in Los Angeles, but it was refreshing to know she didn't get caught up in all the hype. When faith isn't compromised, it opens the door to many more blessings--not only in choosing a career, but also in everyday living. This is one of several novels I have enjoyed by Jacquelin Thomas.Alicia Hill Jones, author of ""Blessings of Purpose"""
4,Enjoyable,"This story had Cinderella written all over it, but I enjoyed it anyway. I liked Deborah Ann's spirit and how she was determined to live for God. I would have liked more obstacles, b/c let's face it. Living for God is not always easy. If it's not the Devil coming at you directly, he's using someone to get you. It just seemed like her choice of a career would have more challenges.I enjoyed the friendship turned romantic relationship btwn the two characters. That was nice.Good story, even if fairly simple. Check it out."
4,Mom Loved It,I bought this for my mother and she likes it a lot. She has so much stuff in her current bag and this is a great organizer. The only little downfall she tells me is that is was too wide for her liking. It is not huge in my opinion but that is the reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5.
1,Not Long Lasting,"This purse is much smaller than it appears in the pictures shown on the web. It was a bit disappointing once I received it. I purchased it as a gift for my mom. Unfortunately, I gave it to her anyway. She first mentioned that her LG cell phone did not fit in the compartment meant for a cell phone. Soon after, it broke on her within the month. I should not have been lured in by the price. Shipping cost as much as the purse itself."
2,Figures are skinnier than I expected,"My son has several Fisher Price Imaginext figures, castles, and pirate ship. I was hoping that these would be about that size, but they are a bit shorter, and much skinnier. Also, their feet are connected underneath, so that they are more similar to the little green army men (in shape) than to the Imaginext action figures."
3,"Not the same quality as the other Safari ""toobs""","We also own the ""Safari Horses Toob"" and it's hard to believe they were both made by the same company! The horses are of excellent quality and detail and the pirates... not so much! The paint job on the pirates is poor at best- with some of the figures it's not obvious right away what it is because the paint job is so poor.Also, I would have rather the toy makers included another pirate than a ship that is smaller than some of the pirates... how are the pirates supposed to play on that teeny tiny ship anyways?"
4,small but pretty cool,bought these to go along with a Fisher-Price pirate boat. They are a lot smaller than the guys the boat came with but still are a lot of fun.
4,Just as described,My grandson liked them as a nice addition to his Fisher Price Pirate ship. They were just as described and a great price.
4,Stranger Among Us,"I received the movie in a timely matter, pretty fast actually. I really enjoy this movie.Thank you so much for the immediate response and delivery. I would order again.Sincerely,Mona Ghaffari"
2,Sally should've stuck with Harry...,"Even if you don't care that this movie's portrayal of an ultra-Orthodox community is absurdly inaccurate, the holes in the plot ruin whatever is left. For example, 1) NYC police would never send a scantily clad woman to meet a Chasidic rebbe; 2) she is alone to arrest two mafia-types, even though it's known in advance when they're coming; 3) she fires her gun in the air in Times Square -- gotta hope that bullet finds a safe place to land; 4) if Mia Sara's character committed the murder, how did she lift the body into the ceiling? What about her accomplices?These and the really poor acting (sadly, with no exceptions) are quite a disappointment. Do yourself a favor and go watch either Witness or Fiddler on the Roof again..."
4,A Stranger Among US,This movie came out when my daughter was a child. Was so happy to get it. We will watch it together and it will bring back memories of that time.
4,Very good movie and..,pleasantly surprise to see Melanie Griffith actually doing a fine job acting. This movie along with Working Girl made me realize that Griffith had she taken on more serious roles she could have been a respectable serious actress.
1,Judaism,"I feel that the movie does not accurately show Religious customs in judaism. If you've grown up in the jewish community there are things that you will pick up on. for example the hairstyles were done wrong. It's not really worth watching. Melanie does a nice job but ... she's not really playing a part, she's sleeping through her part."
2,Absolutely laughable movie,"Melanie Griffith is miscast as a tough NY cop and the plot makes no sense. It isn't an accurate portrayal of Hasidim and the murder mystery isn't logical. Critics called it ""Vitness"" citing it's strained resemblance to ""Witness"". Witness was set in rural PA, this is set in NY city.It's interesting that both Melanie Griffith and her co-star Eric What's His Name found their careers fading after this movie."
4,Better than what the critics will have you believe.,"Took the advice of friends (and some reviewers here) and got this film. Melanie Griffith is excellent as an undercover cop. There was a little too much fascination with the Hasidic culture and that sacrificed suspense and the flow of the story, but overall, I recommend this film very highly."
4,Very interesting and surprisingly effective.,My wife and I were pleasantly surprised. We heard it wasn't very good but as Melanie Griffith fans we decided to see for ourselves. We liked it quite a bit and can give it a 4-star recommendation.
4,A film that touches the heart,"As a Belgian who grew up right after WW2, there were not many Jewish people left in Ostend, Belgium.This movie opened my eyes to those we considered a""strange group of people"".It gave me insight in the fact that we all are different and goodness and love are present in every person, regardless of religion and creed.I would recommend this movie to anyone who looks at the Hasidim with a weary eye.Clara a Claeys, M.A"
5,A Stranger Among Us - Melanie Griffith is great...,A wonderful and heart felt movie. Great acting and story. Very good chemistry between Eric Thal and Melanie Griffith. I like the ending very much. One of Melanie Griffith's best.
3,1/8 power converter,"This works perfectly to convert power from my Big Muff pedal to use a 9v connector to it, I expected to get it quicker though considering I payed extra for the faster shipping."
2,OK,OREDERED LARGE RECEIVED MEDIUM...THOUGHT THE GLOVES WOULD BE WARM WEATHER...VERY MISLEADING AD ...GLOVES ARE FAIR WEATHER ONLY...OH WELL THAT IS INTERNET SHOPPING...
1,pitcher pump,I bought this pump to use on a new well. It didn't work so I contacted seller. They said make sure the side bolts are tight . They were. So I took it apart and the leather piece inside was rotten and fell apart. I ordered a new leather. Tried it out and still dosn't work. Water in the pipe is only a foot from the pump.
1,Does Not Work,"It is very nice to look at but it does not work. I ordered the PP500 but they sent a PP500NL (NL must mean ""non lifting""). I don't know if it was a mistake in shipment and they sent the wrong one, or it is because it is only for decoration and the ad is misleading."
4,'Well' - it sure looks cute,"I bought this for a well I was drilling. It didn't work on the well, but that may be my fault, so I hooked it to a rain barrel water catcher. It's sturdy and has great suction (I would advise putting silicone around the gasket when assembling) I only gave it 4 stars since I really wanted it to pump from the well. - ""Oh well"" (Pun intended)"
5,Excellent product A+++++ seller - thank you,Thanks for fast shipment and great manicure table. My mother is very happy. A+++++ seller
4,An interesting exhibit for Prince or jazz-fusion fans.,"Prince has definitely taken a jazz turn in the past few years. Since the release of The Rainbow Children and XPectation (a fan-club-only release), people have been waiting for him to get back to his pop-funk form. This album doesn't take fans back to catchy tunes, but challenges the audience with fusion music far more interesting than XPectation or the later Madhouse albums.With the style of music loosly based on the region of the song title (North, East, West and South), the album twists and turns into so many different styles and sounds that it requires several listens to fully appreciate. Far more intricately designed that Prince's previous jazz efforts, this album may not be fancied by his pop fans (it certainly bares no resemblance to Purple Rain). Still, it is very well worth listening to and a document as to the talent of this modern musical virtuoso."
5,Get the N.E.W.S>,"Prince continues his amazing growth as an artist with this 56 minute tour de force. Each song (North,East,South & West; hence the title) is 14 minutes long and owes more to Miles Davis than Jimi Hendrix or James Brown. Simply put, this is great music to drive to and relax.......or make love to.The N.E.W.S is wonderful!Art"
2,"NEWS, snooze","I'm a loyalPrince fan. Perhaps too loyal, I continue to purchase everything the man puts out because I was (and still am) captivated by the pure ingenuity of his work in the 80s. Unfortunately, NEWS is another dissapointment for me. I knew it would be all jazz instrumentals when I bought it, but what is disspaointing is how flat out boring the music is on this album. It is basically elevator music. Just because Prince is playing it doesn't mean it is automatically great."
2,Not his best work,"Prince is a brilliant artist who has created some amazing music, but this is not an album that most fans of his will enjoy. It is fairly uremarkable jazz-type music with no vocals...it isn't bad, but most fans will find it boring. It is basically just a recorded jam session and doesn't sound like there was much time spent ""composing"" the songs. If you have all of Prince's other albums, maybe this one is worth a listen, but if you don't, then pick one of his older albums at random and you'll probably enjoy it much more than N.E.W.S. I applaud Prince for trying new things, but most people will not appreciate this experiment."
2,Hmmm.......where is Prince?,"I have been a Prince fan for quite a while, but somewhere along the way (circa 1994?)we lost Prince. I was never a fan of his sexually suggestive lyrics, but I thought he was a musical and lyrical genius. Then he disappeared... Chaos & Disorder? Rave Un2 the Joy Fantastic? The Rainbow Children? These albums have been VERY disappointing to me. I just do not hear the same genius I once heard. And now N.E.W.S. Again I am let down... I must admit I am attracted first and foremost to lyrics. This album is all instrumental. The music is interesting, but not catchy. It does require a second listening. I am truly saddened because to me, a true musician was lost along the way.[ a note to true fans: Could his religious change have affected his relationship with THOSE who helped him make his music? Those who gave the inspiration? ]"
1,the emperor is wearing no clothes!!,don't you see it? this is instrumental funk and jazz done poorly. no melody and no real exception groove - yes it is Prince - yes I have major respect for Prince .....this music on NEWS is simply self indulgent and boring. sorrythe emperor is naked not a genius on this one
4,Purple Music,N.E.W.S. is an off-the-cuff jam session of Purple Jazz. Is it seamless & studio perfect? No. Think of it as a musical conversation. Various topics are discussed. Different voices are heard. There are conversational lulls. Subjects are changed abruptly or just trail off. Is there a point? No - but it was a nice chat.
4,No News is Good News- Not!!,"Prince released an instrumental jazz album? What the... all's i have to say is it's about time. Prince as the incredible musician he is should have released one a long time ago. I've been looking forward to this for years. Let's face it Prince is an amazing guitarist. And despite how weird he is, or the fact his name was once a symbol, doesn't take away from the fact that he is extremely talented, and worth a listen for everyone. HE is too good to be overlooked. HE is also very innovative, and original. THink about it. Every song on this album is exactly 14 minutes, and the album ends at exactly 56 minutes. Sort of reminecent of Emancipation: Every disc was an exact hour making it 3 hours total. How the heck did he do that. What can i say he's creative, as is this album. Alot of passion is in this music and it makes for a great album. ENjoy the music, and just the music."
4,Enjoyable,"I think a lot of fans have listened to this album with the wrong expectations. This one is meant to be listen like a jazz record,or like ambient music if you prefer...If you take it for what it is, ""NEWS"" is another fine piece of work by one of the most gifted musicians of our time. On the other hand and unlike many other rewievers here, i think ""NEWS"" is hardly a groundbreaking record as Miles Davis and Herbie Hanckock made that kind of jazz-funk music in the early 70's long time before Prince.While ""NEWS"" is unlikely to go down in history as a key recording of Prince discography it nonetheless offers 56 minutes of flawless music.... which ain't that bad."
5,Excellent,Kinda like an updated MADHOUSE.Let me know if u like my funk alsohttp://www.cdbaby.com/cd/taki76
2,He's done better,"I gave this 2 stars because only two of the songs were worth listening to. I'm a big Prince fan, but even that fact couldn't make me really like this CD."
1,I'm done,"I have stuck with this guy through all his permeatations, and my level of loyalty has slowly been worn down. I defended Chaos and Disorder (and still do), but Come was spotty, New Power Soul was terrible, and Rave Un2 The Joy Fantastic sounds awful and dated already. Then came The Rainbow Children. I was blown away...loved it! But with this, I'm afraid I am done. It's going to take a lot for this man to convince my to invest any more time and/or money in his self-indulgent whims."
4,Smooth and Funky Jazz,"The music on this CD is smooth and funky. Prince has a tight band. My favorites are East and South. If you like smooth and funky jazz, then buy this cd."
4,Good Prince Instramentals,This was definitely worth the money. At first I was a little skeptical but as I listened to it over and over again I found a deeper appreciation. I think that I was expecting something else at first. This was similar to One Night Alone but just instrumental.
4,Previous review in error,"""A Music Fan"" posted a review on this page, rating the disc 1 star and saying that the disc appeared to be in mono even though it is billed as stereo. I believe he or she may be referring to a different (and almost simultaneous) single-disc release, catalog #30371 00022, of the Missa Solemnis, which uses the 1966 LP reissue cover, complete with its ""STEREOPHONIC"" banner along the top edge, and which used the ""fake stereo"" masters used on that reissue LP, not the original mono masters used on this 2-disc set. The fake stereo version is ABSOLUTELY AWFUL. This newer remastering, which mercifully reverts to the original mono, is no sonic picnic, but is a vast improvement over the other version. The performance is as detailed in the previous reviews. Get it!"
4,Works well,"Product does just what it says. It has lots of jacks for headphones. If they had a product that accepted multiple source inputs in would be mega wonderful. Install I purchased some special RCA split cords to hook up multiple components for the audio. A power switch for the unit would be nice, but no big deal. My wife is happy to not have to listen to movies/stereo when in the same room."
4,Viewsonic VA703b 17-Inch LCD Monitor,"Used it for less than 3 years, than had to replace it under manufacture's warrant..First 2 years I liked it."
4,not for dinosaurs,"This was a gift for my parents b/c their original monitor is the size of my microwave. I wound up having to return it b/c it was not compatible with their dinosaur PC. Otherwise, it seems like a great monitor and I really wish it would have worked for them. Oh well."
4,"An underrated, great family movie","It's a shame that this movie's largely overlooked by critics and audience alike. However, many people who happen to ""stumble"" across this movie will be pleasantly surprised. OK, I'm biased because I'm in the movie. But as an avid movie-goer, I have to say this is one of the better family movies in the past 10 years. The relationships are real and touching. Even though I knew -- from the filming -- how it was going to end, the tears that came down my cheeks caught me by surprise. I wish more people would see it and realize what a great movie this is. Peter Falk and D.B.Sweeney have great chemistry. You also get to see other great actors such as Julianne Moore (unfortunately, for some reason, they always fail to mention this film in her bios)."
5,Roommates,"In agreement with the other viewers, and contrary to the critic's review, this is a wonderful movie that deals with many issues regarding aging in America. Although it takes place in the 70's and 80's it is not dated. It deals with relationships within families, between generations, as well as health and social issues. I use it in my classes on aging and dentistry/medicine as a trigger film for class discussion of a wide variety of areas regarding aging in America. The vast majority of students (dental) find it meaningful and worthwhile. It is very moving, but not maudlin. As one of our students said ""It is nice to see the guys in the class show emotion for once."" I wish it would be rereleased."
4,Splendid movie,"From the beginning, this movie will pull the viewer in. This story deals with the generation gap, with life's successes and downfalls. It shows how people are generous in spirit, traditional in this modern world, and flexible to change. Highly recommended to watch with a good friend on a quiet night."
4,Good Family Movie,"Good movie you can watch with your whole family, nice message for all. ""Colombo"" does a great job in it."
2,Weak entertainment,"This is basically a soap opera designed for the likes of the Oprah channel. Falk does a good job in portraying an unattractive old man, but the script is so weak that even good acting cannot save the film. There aren't any laughs--unless you count the guffaws that bubble up from the audience at the sight of such schlock. I paid $1.75 for the DVD and feel gypped."
4,Kotzev has the connections.....,"Beyond being quite talented, Nikolo knows exactly who to pick for these albums. Goran Edman, Joe Lynn Turner shine as always, nice contibutions from Tony Harnell(Starbreaker, TNT) and Erik Martensson, who I'm not familiar with. Wayne Banks on bass, Matthias Knutas on drums, Nelko Kolarov on keys. I have a couple of these Brazen Abbot cds, this one and Live and Learn with Glenn Hughes and Thomas Vikstrom singing. Very good stuff."
1,Very weak album,"Very disappointed with this album. This album is not a bit close to the album Guilty As Sin or rock-opera Nostradamus. Can only mention one song the SHADOWS with new singer that deserves to be listened. I just wasted my money. I don't like when there is no preview musical tracks, so you don't know what to expect. Can suggest for 2005 the album PAPER BLOOD by Royal Hunt - it is outstanding."
4,"memorable, if rare, work","I read Viper's Tangle (I believe my translation was ""Nest of Vipers"") in high school and became fascinated with Francois Mauriac. I went on to read some of his other works, including ""The Desert of Love."" This work is psychological and personal in nature. If you enjoy stories which probe characters' minds, this is an excellent choice. An invalid man lies in bed, dying, remembering his life and coming to terms with it, and himself. An unknown classic. Also great if you like to collect obscure literature!"
5,Know Thyself,"This is my second Mauriac novel, the first being Woman of the Pharisees, and I enjoyed it immensely. Louis, an aging lawyer, writes a letter to his wife in which he recounts their life together. What begins as a reproach against his family turns into a sort of examination of conscience. The novel ends with a series of exchanges between his grown up children as they offer their own interpretation of his writing. Did Louis amend his ways or were the changes he seemed to be undergoing just another layer of self-deception? Or are the children themselves rationalizing his motives? Mauriac's psychological novel exemplifies the Socratic wisdom that the ""unexamined life is not worth living."""
4,weasel's review,"Online Book Review ""Weasel"" This book takes place in the early1900, on a small farm house in the country. Their are two kids living with there father. The mother died giving birth to one of the kids. The family is having alot of trouble making money and they need food very badly and so the father heads out hunting. In the mean time they do there jobs by taking care of the animals like the pigs and cows. It gets very late and the two kids go to bed. The next day there father still is not home they are starting to get hungry and are needing to eat somthing. They keep waiting day after day and there is no word of there father. That night they hear abunch of loud noise outside of there little house they go out side and all there animals were killed and there horses were taken. ........... I rate this book a 8."
2,It was OK.,Weasal is an OK book. It all depends on what you like. It'sgood if you like History oriented books and it's bad if youdon't. That's all I have to say.
4,I Liked This Book,"I liked this book because it was very suspenceful. The characters in this book were very realistic. The main character was a little boy who was a very adventurous kid. In the beggining of this book, a father goes out hunting and gets caught in a trap made to catch indians. The person who sets the trap is a white man that was sent by the government around the time when families were started to migrate into the western part of the United States. The man was sent to kill off the indians so that they would not try to kill the white people migrating into there territory. (...) All in all i thought this was a good book"
4,Weasel,I haven't picked up a book in three months but when Weasel came out I could hardly set the book down. Weasel is about a boy who has to make a journey across parts of the plains. The book weasel was set in the early 1800's. Weasel is one of the only surviving Indians and has a problem with all white people. Weasel dose not like other people because his Indian tribe was ran off of there land and killed by white settlers and weasel was the only person to stay. ... He likes to play games with others minds. The boy is making the journey with his dad and during the book weasel tries to kill the boys father just because he is white. This action book is very thrilling. So if you like action thrillers than weasel is the book for you.
2,I disliked it greatly!,"I especially did not like this book. I thought it was boring the back of the book tells you the whole plot. I just thought the whole plot of the story was bad. I don't recomend it. The characters clash in an unpleasent way that is not exciting or fun in any way. I was forced to read this book in school and regret it. I in noway intend to say anything bad about the author, because I havn't read her other books. This book, though gives me a bad impression about her other books. A few people might like it but not a lot."
2,A mom's review -- mature material in this book,"This is an emotionally disturbing book, featuring the torture and killing of human beings. Leaving a man in a bear trap to die. Slaughtering a pregnant wife in front of her husband. Cutting a man's tongue out of his mouth. Raiding and killing Shawnee Indians. A man hunting an 11-year-old boy, capturing him, and bragging to him about his crimes. The boy's psychological torment over not killing the criminal when he had the chance.I applaud this as a well-written and engrossing novel, but I question whether the subject matter is appropriate for the age range listed -- 8 to 12. Parents use caution. Just because the main character is 11 does not mean the book is right for your eleven year old."
3,A Good Book,"Would you like to read a good book? Weasel is one of those books that you can't put down. Its about a ""killer"" who used to stalk the Shawnee Indians but has turned to killing the settlers. Out of all the characters my favorite is Nathan. One reason why is because he is smart."
3,An OK Book.,"Weasel is a suspenseful book. At least at the beginning.It was suspenseful at the beginning, but as the story went on, the suspense dropped. I loved the beginning, but what stopped me from giving this book 5 stars was the ending. The ending was just plain corny! Other than that it's a good book."
2,Weasel,This book was a very interesting book. It had alot of adventure in this book that i really liked and thoght it was very interesting. i learned alot from this book and thought it was a okay book. I liked this book and wish to read another one like this.
1,Weasel,This book was about. They lived in the woods & they had a farm. They had 2 kids & their mom died before they really know her to well. Then their dad wants & went hunting. Then that night he didn't come back & they waited later that night & then they want looking for their dad. Then Molly & Joey looked all a rounded for there dad. Then they heared stuff behind them then they hide from whoever it was. Then the guy found Joey & knocked him out & then he tied the kid up. Joey woke up then he got out of the tied thing & then the guy was looking then he got his dads gun & ran off then he found his dad. His dad had a hurt leg so they had to use a horse to bring him home. Then Joey went back to his house & all the animals were died but the horses & they were running around. Then they want back to get his dad and then he walked them home and then they talked and that's it.
3,Weasel,"This book is about a boy, Nathan, and his sister Molly. At thebeginning they hear a knock at their door. It was a man who had theirmother's locket that their father always wore because their mom is dead. They follow him and on the way they see a killer man named Weasel who had cut out the man's voice box. All together I would rate this book ok because it was lacking action. If this boook sounds good to you then you should read on and find out what else happens in it.."
5,One of the most outstanding books,I thought Weasel was an awesome book. It had a lot of excitement and adveture. I thought it had great sentence fluncey. Kids of all ages should read it. I think I will read it again because it was so good.
4,"Wow,what a book!!","When was the last time you read a book that keeps you in suspense? Well, let me recomend the book Weasel by Cynthia Defelice. This book keeps you in total suspence as the characters encounter different situations.Cynthia Defelice's powerful look on surviving in the wilderness with a killer on the run is very exciting. The character Nathan never would have expected that this could happen to him, but it does. The dreams that haunt him of a killer named Weasel were true, until a man named Ezra came along. His silence leads to discovering, who weasel was, and why he never spoke a word. If you like exciting books that keep you on the edge of your chair, you will enjoy this book."
5,Wonderful story,"Carrie McDonnall writes a fascinating and very personal story of her stay in the middle east and at the same time of her husband's passion for the Muslim people. The story of how they reached Iraq, separately and then together is heart-warming and inspiring. Carrie's love for her husband reaches out from the page. You can feel it as the story unfolds. This is a love story, a cultural review and inspiring account of their journey of faith all in one. Read this book to gain an entirely new perspective on the Muslim people and life in the Middle East."
1,Monty Python meets The Scarlet Letter!,"I watched this movie with my 11th grade American Literature students. Many of them are really struggling with the novel. All I can say is we got a really good laugh out of this video. The acting is atrocious, and the special effects and costumes are ridiculous!!! (I don't think that Puritans wore earrings.) All drama students know that actors are supposed to face the camera or audience and speak loudly! It isn't worth buying, but I can say that it gave some stressed out students a little bit of comic relief from a difficult novel. We laughed until we cried, especially when the ""A"" appeared in the sky. So Monty Python!"
1,lol,"Our English class had a hoot over this video. The flashing A in the sky, which looked like some sort of weird LSD trip (""Look, the A in the sky!"" *enter seizure-inducing flashing colors*), and Pearls funny little temper tantrum sent the students into torrents of laughter. Bad acting and effects. It sounded like Pearl was related to Shatner.""I.will.kiss.you.now.Father."""
2,Declining with age,I loved his older stuff like The waiting and one by one. He has gotten into the Indian stuff way too much with the newer material. He should just get back to playing good music and forget about trying to educate the world on Indians.
4,amazing,"this cd is excellent. the onlt other recording to top this one is also by peter buffett:Spirit-A Journey in Drum,Dance and Song."
4,Pictures Please,I love these cookbooks. Great recipes...but I like pictures and then it would have been 5 stars.
1,The Provence Cookbook by Patricia Wells,"As a reader and cook who specializes in French cooking, I want to save fellow readers and cooks time and money. It is one of the worst books I've found about the subject. The pictures are cheap black and white grainy shots of anything but the recipes.Her commentaries are boring and the recipes are disappointing.Don't bother."
2,Not much of either,"I was pretty excited when I saw this book. I've enjoyed other books in the ""pop culture meets philosopy"" series, especially 'The Simpsons and Philosophy' and 'The Matrix and Philosophy'. But 'Poker and Philosophy' is pretty weak, both on the poker side and the philosophy side. It starts off nice enough, but after further reading it's pretty obvious that this book is light, fluffy and probably only written to capitalize on the recent poker craze. It's also very short compared to the other ""...and Philosopy"" books. It could be an interesting read for people who get one or the other, like the earlier reviewer who understood philosophy but not poker. But if, like me, you already have read your share of both poker books and philosophy books, you won't learn much from this. You might find it entertaining (I didn't, but some will) but that's about it. Your money is better spent elsewhere. Like at the poker table, perhaps."
1,"Very heavy reading, not useful for poker players","This book is heavy on philiosphy and has very little of interest to poker players. But it is so heavy that it is slow, difficult reading. I have a masters in engineering and I like philosophy, but not this book. It was like torture going through it, looking for something interesting. If you want to learn poker philosophy, I recommend Doyle Brunson's ""Poker Wisdom of a Champion"" formerly titled ""According to Doyle"" which is excellent."
2,Coating does not last long,"I bought these fry pans thinking that more expensive pans would outlive the cheap nonsticks I've purchased over the years. Despite being treated better (hand washed, plastic utensils) than any nonstick I've ever owned the coating has lasted a fraction of the time. When this pan was new it was a work of art. A year later it's garbage. I'm going back to the cheapee's."
2,Misbalanced handle makes pan tip and is dangerous!!,"This lower cost Emeril line made by All-Clad is high quality (All-Clad is generally regarded as the best commercially available cookware) - and I have enjoyed using this pan, HOWEVER, the handle is too big and too heavy for this pan, and as a result it causes the pan to tip and lift off the burner grate toward the handle (even when it is centered on the grate). This pan's inherent tendency to tip makes it downright dangerous. I bought this pan for($) instead coughing up the extra money for the Calphalon commercial nonstick or one of the All-Clad nonstick fry pans and it was a mistake. The only good thing about the pan is that it served to be my entree into finer cookware - I've since become an addict and have purchased several Calphalon and All-Clad pieces, including the Calphalon 10-inch Commercial nonstick fry pan which I highly recommend instead of this Emeril pan."
3,Business Basics,"Addresses some of the theories, which purport to explain why organizations come to existence, how they perpetuate themselves, why they (sometimes) die, and how they operate both internally and as regard their relationships with the external world. Explores the merits of `open' and `closed' objectives, as well as some of the political issues surrounding the specification of organizational objectives within a framework of multiple stakeholders. Concerned with the implication of individual self interest for the dynamics of organizational life.WAIRAGU"
5,EXCELLENT REBUTTAL,"""Gnostic Types"" run after any fantasy posing as legit . The ""Jesus Seminar,Dan Brown and every other attempt at destroying the Messianic message of Yeshua(Jesus) falls short again and again. Dr. Evans has a biased yes just like memebers of the Gnostic club mentioned before as well as liberal scholars who hate the Christian message BUT the difference is that at least Dr. Evans uses the proper methods of interpreting fact from fiction and comes to his conclusion AFTER he studies the material and not pre-judges the evidence beforehand. The shoddy ""scholarship"" of the Dan Browns of the world are deliberate distortions of fact, the Jesus Seminar is not that much better and DR. Evans does a great job at exposing this fact."
5,A review of the real Jesus and those that knew Him,"What have they done with the real Jesus? Time and time again, we see every Easter, a challenge to the traditional orthodox view of Jesus by the use of late gnostic texts and a jab of pseudo-science archaeology.Dr. Evans' work is a result of what happens when an honest scholar takes a look at the historical evidence for Jesus Christ. A must read for those seeking truth. This book answers the ultimate question: Can we trust what the Bible says about Jesus?Don SausaAuthor ofThe Jesus Tomb: Is It Fact or Fiction? Scholars Chime In"
2,Propaganda?,"This attempt to debunk was as biased as the scholars debunked! Plus, very superficial review of the theories of those who question Jesus' presentation by the Church and as a divine being. Proganda from the Church."
5,"terrific printer, terrific price","this is the printer to get. as best as i can determine, there is no real difference between the quality of the prints from the various epson photo printers. the major difference lies in the bells and whistles. the 785epx cannot print bigger than an 8x10 while the 1200 can. however, this one has the ability to print without your computer, but directly from your memory card. set up was simple and the prints are absolutely fabulous. while i have read some complaints about it drinking ink, it does not seem excessive to me given the quality of the product. ritz camera is in trouble if a lot of people buy this or any other epson printer.i also have an epson scanner which is equally terrific."
2,"Was good, but broke 3 months after warranty","This was a decent printer, but it completely shut down with no warning at the 15 month point... 3 months after the warranty expired! Out of the blue one day, I printed one page and then when I went to print the next one, the parts sounded like the gears grinding in a car and the whole thing just came to a halt.All in all, I hadn't had any negative experiences with Epsons, at work and at home, but after this experience, I would advise two things:1. Be wary of the longevity of Epson printers.2. Don't stock up on too much ink. I'm stuck with about $100 in ink that I can't use unless I buy another Epson."
2,Disappointed with photo quality..........,"I did a great deal of research on printers before purchasing this one. I saw many good reviews of this model, however I was very disappointed in the results. I found that most of my photos are poor quality. They have little rows / tracks across them. I thought it might be the cartridge so I changed it out. This didn't help. I tried printing all different sizes of photos and got the same results. This is not what I expect from Epson and I am returning the printer to upgrade to the Epson 1280. This printer is fine for regular print jobs, just not photography."
1,Watch Out,"Brand new and a real significant problem, echoed by other reviewers. Watch out for vertical lines, white dots, that may appear on 3 out of 4 photos. They will be between 5/8"" and aninch apart and, naturally, the darker the image, the more theyare apparent. Other folks spoke with the local Epson reps and they mentioned ""tight rollers"". This one unsatisfactoy for photo use. I'll return thisone and try another, wish me luck......PS. 2nd one had problems as well, not quite as severe,but still unacceptable. Also, the USB software can be real difficult. Bought a HP cp1700 and I'm in heaven, more $ but well worth it. For some odd reason my CPU and all platforms are running 3X faster with the HP, wonder if the Epson softwareneeds some work as well as their paper feed."
2,Consider a Canon instead,I bought this printer in December 2002 and by July 2003 the print head failed and everything it printed had a dark purple hue. Ink is also expensive. I'm buying a Canon i860 to replace it.
3,"Great photos, but confusing to use","As the previous reviewers have said, the print quality is gorgeous-as long as you use EPSON PAPER. The reason I am giving it 3 stars is because it has been really hard to use. The included software is both incredibly complicated and fairly limited. I finally gave up and printed from the software that came with my Canon camera. I'm sure with time and a LOT of patience I will master their software, but why make it so complicated to begin with? My HP printer is infinitely easier to set up, use and troubleshoot, but unfortunately the photo quality from the Epson is superior. Enough so that we resisted the temptation to pack it up and return it a number of times when it froze up our computer. If it wasn't for the print quality this would definitely be on the way back to Amazon, in favor of my very user friendly Hewlett Packard."
5,Great Printer for the Price,"I have owned this printer for 2 weeks now and have to say I am impressed with the results. I have printed about 10 Full page prints. Yes it does use ink, but the quality when using epson paper is fantastic. The Quality looks just like pictures from an analog camera sent out for developing. It is fairly quiet and takes ~10 seconds to clean the heads when first starting. I have only used the 1440 and 720 dpi modes. I prob will never use the 2880(only for a test maybe)dpi because what I have read form reviews..there is only a difference when looking under >4x Magnification. So far so good."
3,Some Unknown Problems,"This is my first time to buy EPSON printer. (I used to use HP).Overall quality is acceptable, but I still got some strange and unknown problems. Since I am a software engineer, I did resolve by myself. But I could not image how end-user could handle it well.1. Drivers are too complicated.2. EPSON's USB has problem to talk to Windows XP sometimes.3. Ink monitor is not accurate.4. EPSON may show Fatal Error on it's screen sometimes."
1,"OK color, great resolution, poor overall hardware quality","I have now owned this printer for almost 1 year. I use it solely for digital photo prints. The color is OK (some shades better than others) and the resolution is outstanding (difficult to tell the photo was not professionally developed as long as you use the Epson photo quality paper and customized resolution settings).HOWEVER! The printer is clunky, noisy, extremely slow, eats ink like there's no tomorrow and has been plagued with clogged ink cartridges. Unless you print something every day, expect to clean the print heads and replace cartridges frequently."
2,Bad ink jets,"The black jets for this printer get clogged way too often. I can print only 30-40 pages before I have to clean the jets. That equates to about twice a week if you use it often! And it goes through ink cartridges (which are WAY too expensive) quickly too. In general, only buy this printer if you're on a restricted budget and don't have to print often."
3,GetaClue,"The Epson printer seems to be fine for the money spent, the only problem is getting the proper flash adapter card.You can exchange these cards at no cost except for the s&h < but if you have a need for 2 cards ,because you have a choice of 3 memory cards ...I'm here to testify that Epson is ""NOT"" willing to help , all you get is ""you must follow strict proceedures or you will not recieve the needed items"" and then a quick hang-up! Epson ""will not"" sell a memory card adapter to you...go figure!!! You can only get an exchange and you better follow the rules or guess what ...back to square one. I think if Epson wants to stay in the market they better do a little more thinking about sales and the needs of the consumer.The price is right but the attitude is all wrong !!"
2,"After 8 months, pretty much useless","Worked fine for about the first month or two, but has gradually gotten worse.I don't even try to print photographs anymore, and right now it's barely printing out text documents. I don't use it that much, maybe once or twice a week, but it's becoming pointless. I have run through all the diagnostic and cleaning functions - replaced the ink... nothing is happening. oh well."
2,Epson 785EPX,"Great printer if you use it everyday. The ink cartridges dry out very quickly if you don't use it everyday, they need frequent cleaning which dramatically shortens the useful life of a cartridge. After three years of frustration, it is now in the trash! I will be going back to HP. My son-in-law is still using my first one, a 500C which I bought over 10 years ago."
5,"The great hardware, weak software company","Although I agree with all the reviewers who are astonished by the amazing picture quality of the 785EPX, like Kenny Hsu below I am disappointed in the software's capabilities. I've got the same reservations about my Epson scanner (1250) -- if this company would ever get software engineers who are as good as their hardware engineers, they'd be unbeatable. In the meantime, I watch screen messages telling me that my photo couldn't be printed -- while the machine is printing the photo!"
2,Could have been good!!!,"I purchased this printer and have since returned it. I was really looking forward to seeing the great photo quality that Epson is known for. Instead I was very disappointed. To start, the printer left very small marks across all the pictures. In rows about a couple of inches apart. Very evident on darker colors. It apeared to be some product of the feeding mechanism. You might say this was a factory defect but when I returned it I checked the floor model and it did the exact same thing. The Epson rep couldn't explain it away.I have since purchased a HP PSC 750 all-in-one and I can now say that the photo print quality suffered as well. When I compare the pictures from the old Epson to those on my new HP it's remarkable. The Epson has much more pixelation than the HP. I was shocked. It's rare you can compare the exact photograph off two different printers but it sure tells a story. I'm very happy with the HP."
3,Double-edged sword,"The Epson 785 has amazed and angered me all at once. The photo-quality prints are stunning, however, those little 'track marks' that other reviewers have told about are present on my photos as well. The photo paper brand has alot to do with it, tho. HP paper shows the worst marks (9mil), Epson and Kodak paper (8mil) isn't too bad, but under good light, I can still see faint track marks. They are made by the small metal 'cogs' that guide the pic once it leaves the print head. I can't figure out why epson used this type of mechanism, clearly if the ink is still wet, these cogs will leave marks. I'll have to return this printer- I can't display or sell my photos w/ this type of flaw!!I DO like the software package, however. Once you get used to the nuances of it (2-3 pics) its flexible enough for most anyone."
1,Paper feeder jams,"I have had this for a few years and have found that it worked great the first year. However, as in the previous reviews, the paper feeder jams. I have also wasted a lot of paper and ink. I find that it doesn't seem to jam my cardstock as often as it jams the regular inkjet paper. I was convinced by the salesperson at CompUSA that this was the best printer to get. I initially paid about $200 for it and it has been a pain to deal with since. Also, the ink cartridges are about $40 total to replace and a lot of ink was wasted by the printer jamming and continuing to print."
3,First-class blues stylist,"A super stylist working through material from the likes of Booker T. Jones, Little Milton, Albert King...and Koko Taylor.She gets a great chance to show off her power and tastey phrasing and timing, employing a vigorous band, with notable players.Best cuts are the boogie-based ""Put The Pot On"", the familiar and never tired ""Born Under A Bad Sign"" and Toussaint McCall's classic ballad, ""Nothing Takes The Place Of You"".The McCall number is actually a welcome change from a somewhat samey set - Koko can really sell a lyric but the arrangements are medium tempo-draggy and the instrumentation gets a tad monotonous. Someone out there tell me if at least half of the tracks are in the same key and pitch."
5,Time will Tell,"Born a sharecroppers daughter in the deep south, Cora Mae Walton used to play the blues with a piece of barbed wire and washing board . Thus was the beginning of a blues icon. Miss KOKO TAYLOR ,the premiere down home blues diva is a national , living ,treasure ! A life lived on the road in tour buses ,she can teach a few lessons to any younger artist. Koko sings like there is no tomorrow and drags you through the blues as low as it gets. Her recordings do not give her justice, nothing against her in any means , her live performances are simply monumental, almost a religous experience!Time will tell what great masterpiece Koko will do next."
4,"Snug earpiece, microphone could be more secure","This earpiece is much better than my previous one, the Jabra model with the microphone built into the loosely fitted earpiece.The Kyocera model fits snugly in the ear, and the sound quality is very good. The microphone generally picks up my voice and callers say they can hear me clearly. Occasionally, callers hear my voice fade, and I haven't figured out exactly where to clip the microphone for best reception.Call me old fashioned, but I still kinda like those old bulky headsets where a heavy wire projects the microphone outward from the earpiece for precise positioning just below the mouth."
4,Dante's Inferno,"My son is interested in reading all 3 of these books, so I ordered them all. Good quality and arrived in a timely fashion."
2,Bad Binding,The binding is really bad. The pages started to fall off soon after I bought the book.I don't really like the translation. I would recommend Durling's translation.
5,I love this!!,"I just love this movie! I hear about it while ago and never could find it, so when I come across it on here I picked it up. This is a emotional movie that leaves you wanting more. The whole cast has done a amazing job with this. Congrats!!"
1,Yet another amalgam of falsehoods from the economic wrong,"This monumental failure of an economic book chock-full of fallacies has mislead many an investor. This miserable failure of a book results from the incorrect viewpoint of the Keynesian economists who laud supply-side theories, massive debt, and lots and lots of mindless spending from consumers. Mainstream economists do not know what they are talking about and every boom and bust is built upon their policies of intervention, quantitative easing, increasing fiat money supplies, inflation, and funding the Welfare State and Warfare State."
5,LOVE IT!!!,The figures are so great! They arrived in perfect condition. They are a bit fragile so I would not recommend this for kids. This is an awesome figure for an adult collector or someone who is a big fan of the Nightmare B4 Xmas movie.Really nice depiction of both characters!
1,Jack and Sally Head Knocker set from Doll TV,"The first set arrived broken, the 2nd set arrived broken. We had to ship the first two back at our expense. Info they wanted was inside not printed outside so they sent them back unopened. Reshipped at our expense and finally received an unbroken set but at almost triple the cost with shipping ect. I would not recommend this product."
2,unglued,"The product looks great and clean. However, it's very small.The magnet is strong and sticks to my metal locker and won't slide or fall off. The problem is that the the adhesive between the magnet and the metal holder wore off after just a a couple of weeks. The strong magnet is useless if it's not connected to the holder. I wouldn't recommend this this product"
2,"Nice look, but not durable.","I like the look, but the construction wasn't what I had hoped for. The bottom fell apart and, short of welding it back together, I'm not sure how to repair it."
4,"Great product, would like the magnet a bit stronger","Got this for the side of our refrigerator to keep pens/markers in. We have probably 2 pens and 4 dry erase markers in it and it does not slide/move. However, if you put any pressure on it, the thing will slide down."
2,Buyer beware,The design is great as they are nice looking but the glue they used was terrible. The magnet and pencil cup kept falling apart. I used some crazy glue and now it is fully functional. Gave 2 says because I had had to go buy additional glue to fix the poor manufacturing.
1,Magnet coming off after 5 days,"I am so disappointed with this product...thought it looked like a great idea for pens & pencils in the kitchen,,,,5 days after receiving the magnet is coming off....not sure why the magnet wasn't better secured. As my husband would say....""Garbage""."
3,Works,"Looks nice, works as intended, but the magnet is not powerful enough, I had to put another piece of magnet below to keep it in place."
1,NOT magnetic,"Length:: 1:24 MinsI had to show that I am not kidding. This seller wasted precious resources such as fuel, packing materials, and time."
2,Looks great at first...,"This pen holder looks great, and I was excited to receive it and put it in my new kitchen. It was exactly what I was looking for. I came back form work two days later, and the magnetic part is still on the fridge, but the metal holder and all of my pens were all over the floor. I tried to put it back together, but the same thing happened the next day. This would be great if it could actually stay together the way it is supposed to. If I wanted just a pen holder I would have bought just a pen holder. I'm really annoyed."
3,A Good Book for going to school/girls.,This book was fine but just not the book for us. DS had not problem reading it just not interested in the subject. I think it would be great for a girl who was getting ready to go to school or at the very least going to school. Amanda is so excited about going to kindergarten and she makes a friend who is not. Recommended as a reader for 2-3rd grade.
4,Great product at a good price,I bought these to put in my girlfriends car because she had her old stock speakers still. Installation was very easy and they offer great sound quality for the price. Volume also improved. You will notice the difference right away.
1,Extremely Uncomfortable,"The cut of this product is extremely uncomfortable. There is a large seam that runs up the backside that you cannot see in the picture that, well... rides up in the worst of places. The cut also doesn't give you much room in the front. And to boot, the fabric is no different than your average Hanes. I'm not sure how Versace could pull off selling these at a premium. Trust me, you are better off buying the ""average man's"" brief."
5,Parkway Delivered with this release!,"If you have the first two Parkway Drive CD's ""Killing with a Smile"" and ""Horizons"" and have never heard the songs on this release... then YOU ARE REALLY MISSING OUT! this album is worth importing unless you are lucky enough to find a seller from the U.S. that is selling this... you are going to have to Import this like I did. It is worth it, from song 1 to the end it is just great. ""Looks like Yoda"" and ""Don't Close Your Eyes"" are two of the greatest songs ever written in my opinion.. lol im just a fanatic you need to buy this if you love Parkway... if you dont buy this then you dont like them"
3,Not the Parkway your use to.,"First off it's only 7 songs because track: 1 is a cry baby repeating ""I don't wanna die"" over and over for two minutes..I can't even bother to remember the other band on this CD but your not getting 8 songs from Parkway, your getting like 5. Also shipping took almost a month. Still have much respect for PD without a doubt."
2,Advocates letting your baby cry,"I read this as a new breastfeeding mom, and I got lots of conflicting info and feelings. Though she seems to be promoting attachment parenting, the author is very adamant about a baby's ""need"" to cry. She does recommend that you hold the infant while he's crying, but she is against breastfeeding for comfort, which I don't agree with. She talks about letting the baby cry instead of nursing so he won't get into a ""control"" pattern. I'm sorry, but a 3 month old baby just needs comfort. Furthermore, her references are very sketchy, especially when it comes to her personal theories, which she presents in the same way that she presents the factual information. This can be confusing to the reader. Good thing I checked her references in each chapter to see where she got her info!! Not recommended."
5,Really helpfull,"It is a great book that change completly my point of view. Now I know how much babies can feel, learn and understand since they are born. I have learnt that they must be respected in all their wishes, actions and feelings and that we, the adults, do not know better!!!!"
5,excellent book!,This book is excellent for about-to-be parents and new parents to have guidance for what really happens with your baby and how to be open supportive and aware so you can foster your child's development without scarring them emotionally. I am amazed at the scope and excited to have it in my library.
1,I really dislike this book,"A friend of mine got this book and loved it. She handed it to me and I just could not get through all of it. The basic assumption of this book is that when your baby cries you should sit there and do nothing but pat them on the back and say ""You go ahead and cry"". While this is great for adults, this does nothing for children. A major problem seems to be the incorrect assumption that people who practice attachment parenting don't allow their children to cry. Attachment Parenting is all about *responding* to a child's cries. Sometimes you can't do anything to comfort your child, but that doesn't mean you stop trying of try and force your child to stop expressing their emotions.I found nothing in this book that I liked that wasn't in either ""The Baby Book"" or ""You Are Your Child's First Teacher""."
5,"Good,excelent and enjoyable","I always say that DBZ lost part of its bright without its real voice talent and real music.But,you can't never wish too much.Well,about this video,I really hate this two little androids killing people without any cause.I really like DBZ and it is a great serie but as I said before the japanese version is MUCHHHH better.I gave it 5 star because the plot was enjoyable and no matter what changes can this anime suffer it will always be the best of its kind.I recomend it if you really like DBZ specially with this androids."
2,sequel runs out of steam,"I enjoyed the previous book, but was terribly disappointed that this book does not bring the story to a conclusion. enough already!"
1,never buy a sequel without checking these reviews!,"I actually shelled out for a hardcover version of this book, but not before checking the last page for the dread phrase ""Continued in XXXXX"" which was absent. But the author and publisher LIED to me. A grotesquely disappointing and depressing sequel to a sequel and she still hasn't wrapped it up. I'm beginning to smell ""Riverworld Syndrome"" here. I admire Barbara Hambly's writing but publication of the last two books in this series, at least as they currently stand, was a Very Bad Idea."
1,Enough already,"Dragonsbane was good. Dragonshadow was not. Knight of the Demon Queen is an unsatisfying litany of horrors committed by demons. This book could be the end of a trilogy (at least it doesn't say ""to be continued"" like Dragonshadow) or it could be the third portion of a tetrology. But, like its predecessor, it is depressing and has either a sad ending or an ambiguous ending that allows for another sequel. The series should have ended with Dragonsbane. Ms Hambly: Please do better. You have been on my preferred author list, but with the last two books in this series, that position is in danger..."
1,Dragon's bane descends to the pits,"By the end of this book, I believed that was it. Hundreds of pages of dreadful led me to the conclusion that the end is the end. All the heroes are dead, good people and good deeds are wasted against an uncaring world."
4,Hambly shows she can think around corners . . .,"Where the original Dragonsbane was a far more traditional novel of fantasy, Knight of the Demon Queen has blazed a new path in fantasy AND science fiction in general. Her world in these books has become even darker, and introduces a new environment we never expected to stumble upon reading a series originally based on dragons.My love of Aohila continues in this book, along with the demon Amayon. Like I observed in the previous review of Dragonshadow, Morkeleb continues to be less significant, but hambly has built such a rich world since the original book we can allow this.Is the book dark? Yes. Is it innovative? Yes. Worth reading? Yes . . . but be sure to have a copy of Dragonstar close by."
2,Where's the love??,"I started the series in the middle, with Dragonshadow, and absolutely loved it. It was dark and powerful, not a predictable fantasy tale where everything works out sickeningly (and unbelievably) perfect. I found Dragonsbane a little lacking, but still quite impressive. Knight of the Demon Queen, however, made me furious. At the dismal ending of this dismal novel, I got the feeling that something terrible happened to the author, and she was taking it out on her characters. Although I did enjoy the cyberpunk world at moments, overall, this novel should not have been written, unless Dragonstar is somehow able to make it all worth it... Good luck...!"
4,Warning...,"This book is really, really dark. And, as the editorial review notes, it ends in the middle of the story, with the main characters in a really bad spot. Still, it's a great story. And fortunately the conclusion of the series (""Dragonstar"") has just been released. Might as well save yourself some agony and get both at the same time."
1,Yuck!!!,Having read both the previous books in this series I really wasn't looking for much but I did want to see if the characters were redeemed any this time around. What a mistake where Dragonsbane was great and Dragonshadow was mediocre this latest is the dregs. Not a good thing happened to any of the characters and I really feel that Ms. Hambly could have come up with some sort of ending. Being left hanging when all the main characters appear to be dead is just nonsense. I don't see any reason to stick around for a sequel. As another reviewer wrote. This is Hell how could it get any worse!
1,What will become of our heroes? Who cares?,"The first book in this series is a well-worn friend; ""Dragonshadow"" I returned to the store I purchased it from, disgruntled, but at least it was able to stand on its own as a novel. This boring bit of trash I left in the store, irritated that I'd wasted three hours of my life on it. It's basically character movement, getting them to where they need to be for the NEXT book, heaping further indignities on the main characters while using others (Gareth, Trey and Polycarp leap to mind) as throwaways (and using the magnificent Morkeleb the Black as a taxi, for the Lady's sake!). Hambly leaves them, with the cliffhanger, in a place where they cannot escape without violating the integrity of the situation as it stands. I NEVER thought I'd be writing this -- certainly Ms. Hambly may do as she pleases with her characters -- but I don't give a damn about what happens to anyone in this book, and I won't be bothered to look around for the sequel."
1,Avoid them all after Dragonsbane,"Each book in the series after Dragonsbane is bad. Not ok, not mediocre, bad. They stray from the things that made Dragonsbane so good, and the things that make the hambly fantasy novels in general good. These are bad books. Bad. Did I mention they aren't good?"
2,Not the best in the Series,"I was disappointed in this version of Gifts in a Jar. A handful of the recipes I would try myself, even fewer to give as gifts. Some recipes use the slow cooker to essentially 'bake' the dish in the slow cooker!!?? And I do not want give gifts serving 12 people for a family of 4 that may not be interested or even like these types of dishes. I feel most of the 'gifts' in this book would be better if entirely prepared, presented and shared, there will be fewer disappointments this way."
2,Blah,This one falls short...it has alot of dessert type coffee cakes. i was hoping it would be as good as one dish meals or soups...but it's not. Still a fun cookbook to add to my collection.
5,Gifts In A Jar,Item arrived quickly and in great shape. Very professional business relations. I would recommend this buyer and this book.
4,You Need To Gamble To Get To The Final Table,"I only learned to play poker in 2007, and I have read about 8 books on the topic. I would say that every book can best teach only 5 or 6 concepts. The basic message of this book is that one needs to gamble a bit in the early rounds to make the final table in a multi-table tournament. Essentially, if one goes to a poker room on a Saturday morning, one needs to take risks playing difficult hands such that one gets knocked out of 2 or 3 tournaments during the morning. Getting knocked out is fine and saves time; then by the mid-afternoon in yet another tournament the gambles will happen to work, and this strategy will have placed one at the final table, where one then can ""tighten up"" and really try to win some money -- but Erick would say that, even then, don't tighten up too much!"
2,Useless,"I will not recommend this book to anyone as it doesn't have much content in it. For serious players, I recommend Dan Harrington's books."
3,Nothing special,"This was the fifth poker book I have read and I would rate it last of the five. It is short on details and could be summed up in a few chapters. Much of the book is nothing more than advertising for the World Poker Tour and about 20 pages are nothing more than a list of the first three seasons money winners on the WPT. The book does share some creative poker theory, but I would say start with Harrington's (Vol's 1 and 2) books or Doyle's Supersystem if you are looking for an informative, detail-based book to build your knowledge of the game."
3,"great pattern i.d. book, poor price guide","""Pattern Glass"" by Mollie Helen McCain is an excellent identification guide for early american pattern glass. The patterns are organized by characteristics and pictured clearly. I have had much success in finding the pattern name for glass. As a price guide it leaves a lot to be desired. Patterns are grouped in one of six catagories and priced according to catagory. As both a collector and dealer I find that many patterns are considerably under priced, and that rarity of individual items of a pattern are not considered."
1,Total disappointment,"It is admittedly difficult to find a recording of Tchaikovsky's Pezzo Capriccioso on Amazon, so I was obliged to buy this recording ""blind"". On it, French cellist Maurice Gendron delivers one of the most disappointing, and sometimes even laughable, performances I have heard to date. Instrumentalists in the early 1900s were in the habit of frequent glissandi, i.e. Heifetz and Primrose, but sliding to and from every shift, as Gendron does, is beyond poor taste. There is little music-making in this performance. It is so atrocious, actually, that the CD was returned to Amazon before even giving Symphony No. 3 a listen."
4,Vegeta super saiyan,The animation is cool and Vegeta looks good as a super saiyan.Android 19's voice is bad but you only hear it for a little while.The episodes are good especially the first one.
5,vegeta finally a super sayan,"yes, finally it is true in this video the almighty sayan finally turns into the golden angel.this video is so cool. animation the best.the fighting is still cool. very recommended."
1,Battery worse than one I replaced--doesn't hold a charge,"I purchased this battery to save money, but got what I paid for. It doesn't hold a charge any longer than my old one."
5,Great product!,"I have always wanted to be able to use regular straps on my rack without risking them falling off, and these work perfectly! They work exactly as they should!"
2,Plays the Notes,"If you like Spanish Flamenco and 'classical-on-guitar', and have already heard Segovia or Sabicas or Lagoya/Presti or the Romeros or Williams play some of this music, then you might also think Barrueco comes in somewhere distant. For enjoyment, also consider artists Parkening, Bream, Isben, Holzman or... well, all these folks project more than just the notes. This earnest-but-mechanical effort by Barrueco is an acoustically clear recording but contains not ALL of the music... IMHO."
2,Disappointed,"I was expecting something a bit calmer. The music is ok, but the video clips change every few seconds. Not something to put on the tv for a quiet time."
3,He's MUCH better live.,"I bought this album after having seen Kenny Neal live in a small auditorium. I have to say that I was somewhat disappointed in this recording. The songs are great but the production seems somewhat contrived and overdubbed. It just doesn't capture the same drive, spontaneity and imagination that is characteristic of the real Kenny Neal. And for the blues, feel is everything..."
1,"good video,but wack song","Sean Paul hit pay day a few years back,but now His latest just sounds&seems like He is making music that is more based on formula than anything else.pretty Bland cut."
1,This is the CENSORED version,"The ""Recognize it"" version is the Wal-mart Christian Right version. It is CENSORED.Get the album Trinity instead, it has the ""Legalize It"" version.Censorship SUCKS!"
3,Hungarian Dictionary,"I was disappointed. Many of the words that I looked for were not in the dictionary, but they are of common usage in our area - Also there were commonly-used names not in the book."
5,Hungarian Practical Dictionary,Hungarian Practical Dictionary: Hungarian-English English-Hungarian (Hippocrene Practical Dictionaries) (Hungarian Edition)The dictionary is concise and easy to use with thousands of entries.
4,Dragon Ball Z has another good story,"Once again DBZ has another excellent plot to give the viewers at home! Assault has great fight scenes and isn't dragged out with too many pointless insults between Goku and Captain Ginyu, commonly found in other DBZ episodes. Do yourself a favor and buy this one!"
3,Great Features for an OK Show,This is a decent DVD. The Ginyu Saga was never my favorite. I was surprised and very happy to find the original japanese language with subs in here. Very cool. If you have a dvd player than I definetley reccomend.
4,I LOVE THIS TAPE!,I must say overall i was very impressed with this tape.Dragonball z is now going into high gear.Those of you who liked the original voice actors will be greatly diappointed with dragonball z here on in.I really enjoy the new music.It is much more in tune with the on screen action and atmosphere than the previous soundtrack.The animation quality has also taken a giant step forward.Take a look at the sequence where goku is powering up before a stunned captain ginyu.wow!And it ill get even better in upcoming volumes!To those of you who have seen the original japanese version you will find the us version insulting but most certainly enjoyable nonetheless.The best is yet to come.I promise you!!Hopefully dragonball gt will show up before long!Keep on buying these tapes!!You won't be sorry!
4,"Great Movie, bad voices","The new Dragon Ball Z episodes are good and everything like the action and stuff are good, but the music and voices are retarded. The music has little beat to it and the voices, well, are different. Not one voice stays the same. The only voices I recognized was Gohan's and Freeza's but they weren't that close. But anyway, it only loses one star for the music and voices, but the action is great and Goku and the others kicks some serious ***! Thats about sums it up."
2,"don't waste your money on this, watch it on cartoon network",i don't know whats up with the voice actors or the new soundtrack. all of us hardcore fans wait forever and this is all they give us. watch them on cartoon network. i'm happy to see it airing finally but at the same time i am dissapointed. it could be so easy if they kept it true to the original. i love dragonball and this is awesome stuff but its horribly put together and i don't understand it. it didn't have to be this way. but i am also happy to see it uncensored.
3,Dragonball Z - Captain Ginyu - Assault,A good DVD for any Dragonball Z fan interested in its original form. The translation is fairly good. However there are no extras to speak of on this DVD which I guess is ok since FUNimation is insistent on bombarding us with the same previews over and over again.
5,AWESOME!!!!,Dragon Ball Z is the ultimate in anime! Anyone who loves fighting and great animation should check this out.
2,Sound is awful,"If you have seen other DVDs, you are going to hate this one. All the character voices are different and also are no good. Hope they will revert to old people for dubbing. The new Trunks DVDs aren't from Pioneer either, oh man... :("
2,"I like DBZ, but the voices?!","I got the uncut version from funimation, I don't like the new voices. And I don't know what takes them so long to Dub?? They've had 2 years!! It doesn't take that long to dub a video! The first 80 so so episodes were great! But these new episodes aren't as good as the others. Get these only if you're a collector, otherwise watch Cartoon Network in the fall."
1,WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU PEOPLE?,"WHY? DO you give this such good reviews?It has bad music,the worst voice acting,and this one is censored.Why buy this shit when you can get a subtitled version that's better.Shame on you people for thinking this. Well,if your going to get this don't get the censored one.GET THE UNCENSORED ONE.BUT there is still the editing that we all know and hate."
1,"Jigai (next time), Dolagonborru zetto, dub sucks!","Those of you who say that this video RULES obviously don't realize that Dragonball Z in America isn't even a 100TH of what it was in Japan! Everything good in the original was flayed and transformed into a horrible kid's cartoon. DBZ is animation, not a cartoon. I rest my case."
4,Goku X 10!,"Well, Goku finally arrives on Namek, and his power is so great he trashes the Ginyu like they're nothing. It's pretty good, the action is interesting but not great, considering that Goku doesn't face anything worthy of him yet(meaning Freiza). I'd really only recommend this for serious collectors, because it's not a good video unless it's in a series. However, if you intend to get the second Ginyu tape and the beginning of the Freiza saga this is a great buy."
3,It was ok,These episodes were the greatest but the american was just horrid and the japenese was ok. I suggest buying double cross with this DVD.
1,wrong product,you sent wrong product. I thru it away and purchased it at Best Buy. Too much trouble to return it. New item cost less than the shipping.Bill Goldstandtwegold@goldstandt. com
2,"Contrived, Laboured, and Poor Pacing","In general the pacing is all over the place. The author tries to tie over suspense by cutting to other story lines, or through the use of back flashes but it annoys the reader. A lot of the time the characters go on rants and ravings that are mostly incoherent.You read through 4/5th of the book before Brian finds out how twisted the colony is. The satire isn't really satire, its a outright criticism. If you're looking for wit and true satire, you're not going to find it here.Most of the situations are so ridiculous and overly contrived that it really does appear to sound like an episode of Gilligan's Island. The book attempts to make a comment about society but doesn't really offer any insights on a middle ground, instead it shows an extreme spectrum of the scale in a vain attempt to make sure the reader got the point of the book."
4,Hottie can Act!!,"Alright, I have to admit that the title of my review woud scare away anyone expecting something thoughtful or insightful. That's OK. I really enjoyed this movie. The title Character, Nia, has to learn to accept every part of herself: the Black parts that conflict with her white peers; the white parts that conflict with her Black peers, and the strictly Nia parts that conflict with everyone. What is her solution? Should she ignore one part of herself to develop the other? Or maybe she will feel better with the right boyfriend....This dilemma is handled in an imaginative and mature fashion. I really recommend this movie."
3,Pretty Good,"this is a Interesting Movie on a Young Lady who is Half Black&White&deals with each part of her human Growth.this film has been done before with a little better results, still Karyn(Super Juicy)Parsons gives a Good Solid Performance.worth a Look at her World&Finding Idenity."
5,a Spiritual Revival,"Some of the songs on this album are very familiar.John Tesh is a spirited performer,who ranks high with today's contemparary artists. Such tunes,like Breathe,or I Can only Imagine,are pastoral and moving. They bring peace and harmony to the Soul. There are other upbeat melodies,like Trading My Sorrow or Open the Eyes of My Heart, that make you clap and jump for Joy. This collection makes your heart feel Wonderful!"
4,"Havent Read it, heres Back cover Details at least.","Ernest Chapman was an unknown soldier with the ill-fated British force sent to defend Greece agaunst the Nazi invasion, left stranded when the campaign ended. It was four years before he was able to leave, but by then he was a Greek legend- KIRIAKOSDuring those horrific years in the heart of enemy-occupied territory, Chapman made four desperate escapes from his captors, hoping to find a way home through Turkey. But treachery and bad luck led three times to recapture and the Gestapo. Undaunted, Chapman made his fourth and last escape . This time he made contact with Greek guerrillas and became one of their most daring fighters. It was 30 years before the man from Barnsley returned, to a hero's welcome."
4,Very adorable bear,"I bought this as part of my daughter's birthday gift. She had just turned 6. I wouldn't say that it has a lot of educational value, though she does play school with it and it goes to school with her quite often, so maybe it is smart ;) The bear seems to be very durable (we havent had to perform any surgery on her yet :). My daughter isnt always the most gentle child with her toys either. Overall it is a very cute bear, perfect for a little girl that loves bears and ballerinas."
4,Our Quaker Ancestors: Finding Them in Quaker Records,"Our Quaker Ancestors : Finding Them in Quaker RecordsThis book is well written and easy to follow with good examples. It's a comprehensive guide to finding Quaker records for genealogical research. Reading this book will make the journey much easier and will facilitate interpretation of Quaker records. I have only just begun the process, but the information provided in the book has been a great help in getting started."
2,Our Quaker Ancestors,Not at all the information I had hoped for. Disappointed. Service was great though.It came quickly and packaged very well. Thanks anyway.
2,garbage bag holder,"this was a good idea but lacks useage. the rack isnt wide enough for paper grocery store bags. and although you can use plastic bags, they dont hold a lot and you cant over fill, it gets stuck in the rack. so it was a good idea but lacks."
2,"good service, bad product","I ordered two halloween costumes for my kids. One (Princess Amadale -- not sure of the spelling) was quite nice, but the Ninja costume was cheap and is going in the garbage this morning. He wore it to a party Friday and came home with it ripped in three places. I managed to sew it back together so he could wear it for trick-or-treating but what a piece of junk. The plastic shin guards are too heavy for the light nylon fabric they are sewn to and not totally sewn down so all it took was the top part of the shin guard hitting against something for each of these to rip off (one along the seam, the other the shin guard actually tore itself -- almost impossible to mend and something that would not survive washing)Yuck. Not sure the convenience is worth the expense if you only get two wearings out of a costume . . ."
1,disappointing & lackluster,"This was basically just Kings of Leon performing their show frontwards to backwards with nothing in between. I've been to two of their shows which were both great but this particular show wasn't interesting, they just seemed to be going thru the motions. They are my favorite band so I had high hopes for this DVD but, alas, it was a waste of money. There weren't any backstage interactions or any commentary from the band; just a straight-forward taped performance, so if you've seen them live there is no point to buy this."
5,Awesome Kings of Leon Live compilation,"Got it yesterday and watched is yesterday, awesome recorded live performance of KOL, like the whole set it was picked and very enjoyable concert to watch. If you just like ""Sex on fire"" take a look at previous albums, if you dont like 'em don't buy it because it has many old songs ... unless you want to know them or like the whole style of their music. Very recommended for older fans tho !"
3,Not bad,"If you're a real fan of the band, you will probably like this DVD. But as a casual fan, I found it a bit disappointing. The lead singer seems to suffer through the concert rather than enjoy it, and because of all the close-ups of his face, this is a real distraction throughout. But the sound quality is good."
4,Good Stuff !!,Must have for all Kings of Leon fans....I'm not going to make a huge deal about this Disc but it really cooks! The only problem with it is that I was not there. Enjoy!
4,Good DVD,"this is a good DVD, it has all the good KOL songs. Sound is good and quality is good. I would definitly recommend."
5,AWESOME!,"Caroline's Spine is the best kept secret in music! Their music is original, inspired, and just sounds great! If they're ever in the area, i definately reccomend going to see them oive though. The two times i've sen them they were better than the band they opened for."
5,This Album Rocks!!!!!!!!!!!!!get it getit,Caroline's Spine on this album how can i put it simply....it rocks heavy i unlike these other lucky people have never seen them live but i can tell from this cd they would be the best band live i could ever see....i picked it up in february and everyday i slap myself for not hearing of these guys sooner.......they really are cool........this album may be a year and a half old but it is very good i suggest that everybody on earth pull their heads out and get at least three copies cuz i'm on my 4th....no joke!!!!!! can't wait for the next one!!!!
2,Very much of the same,"After hearing Attention Please on the radio I tried the Monsoon album. What a big disappointment. No outstanding songwriting, bad chorusses, heavy guitars and songs that all look the same made this album not worthwhile buying it. A little light in the darkness is the nearly accoustic Wallflower song. But why did these guys have to use these heavy guitars in the middle of the song. What a pity.RobertThe Netherlands"
4,Good melodic rock!,"A week ago, a friend told me to buy this record! I bought it, and i must say i'm not disappointed! If this album was an ep, with just the first five songs, i would certainly award it with 10 stars. As it's not, i just gave it 4, because the first five songs ( ""king for a day"", ""you&me"", ""sullivan"", ""wallflower"" and ""monsoon"")made the album! The other songs are only listenable..."
3,not so good phones,"i have 3 extra sets and when ringing always one of them doesnt ring, and the caller id doesnt work 50% of the tme, when holding with the hand full on the back of the phone the signal is blocked"
2,trying too hard to please,"This band wants too much to be all things. There are numerous other jam bands & newgrass bands who do a much better job at breaking down barriers between musical genres. The musicianship, while good, pales by comparison to some of the true giants in the field. At the risk of being cruel, suffice to say that there are no Bela Flecks, David Grismans or Tony Rices in this lineup. Neither do the vocals compare with a John Cowan. While they want to take on different styles, the rhythm section lacks the flexibility of, say, that of String Cheeese Incident, which can move fluidly from salsa to jazz to bluegrass & never miss a beat (literally & figuratively). As a long time newgrass fan, I looked forward to this much ballyhooed disk with some anticipation. Needless to say, I was disappointed."
4,Rhythmical and commercial,"A very rhythmical work, also very listenable... But I don't like singing, it's a bit ""weak"". While listening to, you'd wish they don't sing and just keep playing.Musically, it's far closer to fusion than to experimental krautrock, something that seems usual for Embryo after their debut ""Opal"".Anyway, if you like ""Bad Heads"", I recommend this, being more rhythmical and not so commercial."
4,HEARTBREAK EXPRESS & GREAT PRETENDER Still not on CD???,"Well, all I can say is AVERAGE... I am amazed at how deep we can pull songs from her catalog to make a fast buck for a compilation, but we still have yet to see ""Heartbreak Express"" 1982 or ""The Great Pretender"" 1984 both on RCA to be released onto c.d. WHY ARE WE STILL WAITING???There are a few great gems on this particular collection that the avid fan will go for, and the price is fair. However, there are over 20 compilations on the market, and I'm being kind by leaving it at 20... Do we really need another compilation? Or even worse... Do we need to keep putting on c.d. 9 To 5 and Odd Jobs???I think someone needs to step up to the plate and give Dolly and the fans her complete catalog on c.d. and stop putting out meaningless compilations with newer photos, and release Heartbreak Express & The Great Pretender!!! It would also make the music industry look like they know what they are doing for the first time in MANY years..."
5,Great Mix of Education and Entertainment,"Most people learn best when they hear a good story. The fictional engineer Marmadukedebugs a problem in mechanical or electrical engineering in each story. Because you areentertained while reading, you will remember these problems and solutions. The process ofdebugging and puzzling about the problem is portrayed very well.Yes, the stories are [the best] in a 1950s kind of way. They are also cartoon-like, withoverblown characters. Please ignore these two liabilities, and sit back and enjoy somegreat engineering stories.The book contains about 100 stories, and they first appeared in the magazine POWER between1950 and 1979."
1,this burner is a headache,In over a year I have not been successful in getting the Sony CRX220A1 to function consistently or properly. B's software (used with this device) is so complex that anyone who does not spend most of their free time playing with these kind of devices has no chance. I am shopping around for something else!
3,maybe someone can help me...,"I bought this item on e-bay and it works just fine, but for some reason I can only burn 2 CDs per day at the fastest speed available on this drive. I get a better chance of getting a CD burned at 8x! what could be the problem? If you have the answer please e-mail me at mikeirvan@cox-internet.comThanks,Mike Irvan"
3,Black finish turned white after first use,"I like this grate but I was disappointed that the black finish turned into an ashy white after first use. The grate works well and looks great with a fire in it but it looks pretty shabby when it's not in use. Apart from that, it's well made and a good price."
4,Really nice grate really nice price,"Good size, very heavy cast iron. Much better than similar ones in stores for the same price. Arrived faster than expected. Very happy with this purchase."
1,A big hole was burned through the grate after only two fires.,"What more to say? Four times we heard a sudden SNAP, much louder than the crackling of wood. It turned out that the iron platform was breaking - two pieces fell to the bottom of the fireplace and left a large hole in the grate after only one week of ownership."
3,Limited life,"While I agree with many of the positive comments in the other reviews, I was disappointed that after five years of use the center area of the grate had ""burned"" thru. We burn a fire every evening during the winter months, and I had hoped that the grill would last longer given how heavy the cast iron is. It would help if the manufacturer had thickened the cast iron in the center where the fire is much hotter."
4,great fit and good design,Well made in the United States. It fit the fireplace perfectly! Just the right height. I would gladly recommend this product.
1,Not that great for trading cards,Many errors in trading card section. Plus no mention what-so-ever of x-rated #207 card and also no mention of any Heritage cards
4,Good program.,"I gave 4 to it because it isn't really has all the options running properly under OS X, but it works and provides GOOD training."
4,"Indeed a ""practical guide""","This book was highly recommended to me by a dancer friend, and I've found it to be extremely useful for dance improvisation sessions I'm leading with a group of non-dancers. The authors offers numerous exercises that groups can build on, experiment with, and use to generate skill and teamwork. If you're looking for inspiration for your own performance project or creative ideas for group activities, you will find them here."
5,"A great read for actors, directors, and performers of all levels.","Aptly described in the title, ""A Practical Guide to Viewpoints and Composition"". Perfect for new and veteran artists alike. Great information about ensemble building as well as getting outside of your comfort zone. The kind of book to go back and re-read with every new project. You'll find yourself applying techniques consciously as well as unconsciously."
5,Quality,"Great CD, practically new... had my CD in 3 days and was excited and happy to recieve this item in such a short shipping time. Would use and recommend buyer again and again."
5,It's awsome,"It's awsome. With the mixture of the androids coming, the first sight of baby Trunks, and Vegita turng Super Saiyan, you'll be keep watching until you're sick. Even if you're not a DBZ fan you would love it in your collection."
2,Its alright,"An alright dbz dvd. The androids finally come. The extras are not anything special, and I care less how they included 2 language versions. Who cares about the original japenese, people really need to just realize english is better. The voices in Japanese are horrible and do not fit the characters at all (because the voices are too high and annoying). But in English they did a really good job with this DVD. Still it is kinda boring, and if you have seen it on TV there is no point in getting it."
5,DragonBall Z - Android - Dr. Gero,"This video starts the long awaited battle with the 2 androids(#19 & #20) Dr. Gero built. Will the training of 3 years be enough by the all z-warriors to handle these 2 androids?. we can only wait and see when this video comes out, but we all trust in Goku and their friends to handle them and of course be victorious."
4,dr. gereo and the androids,This is about dr. gereo and the androids that he makes. Remember trunks warns goku and every one that in three years the androids would come. To find out more order the video.
5,Excellent resource for the intermediate/advanced knitter!,"This video by Elizabeth Zimmerman and Meg Swansen, her daughter, is an excellent resource for knitters who want to expand their skills and think outside the pattern. A video exploration of the projects shown in the book of the same name, Knitting Around brings us into the homes of Elizabeth and Meg with their unique sense of humor, sensibility, and well, just plain common sense:) At the end of the first of the three disk set are reminiscences of EZ (as she is fondly called in the worldwide knitting community) of her life in England, her studies in Germany and the emigration with her German husband (who was not loved by Hitler and the dislike was mutual) to the United States. Meg Swansen takes a lot of EZ's ideas and ""unventions"" yet a step further with her own incredibly clear instructions and dedication to the details that make knitting an art form. Can you tell I really loved this DVD and the accompanying book?:)"
5,Love this product,Has taken me from self taught novice to a confident knitter within a very short time. A great resource.
3,"Great for some things, OK for others","For the price, it ain't too shabby. I've had mine for about three years. So far, I've ground beef, chicken and elk. If you cube it up or cut it into strips and have it semi-frozen and add to the grinder, it works great. No mush, just a good grind and great consistency. Meaning burger comes out as burger. I've used the two largest grinding plates and have done well.So far, the downside is when you have ground meat and then push that through for sausages, it's difficult and you have to shove the ground meat through and it takes forever and makes a mess. It does work and I like the grind for summer sausage ..but it's not fun and it's a mess.Don't use ground meat and it works like a dream. Don't grind bones either."
4,waring pro meat grinder,"A good price for the grinder, but was dissapointed that there was not any receipes included with the machine. These usually come with a product like this."
3,Good grinder but failed quickly.,"This was a nice little grinder, but it stopped working after we used it about 30 minutes. I suspect there was a problem with the remanufacturing. The company that sold it to us arranged for us to ship it back via Fed-Ex. I expect to see a credit on my next credit card statement."
3,"Leela, Leela, Leela","That's all I can say. My daughter actually turned me on to Ms. James. I bought this cd not realizing that it was simply several remixes of her song Music. This song laments what is happening to soul music. However, I am not disappointed. I love her voice and I just use the remixes as exercise music."
1,no tech support,several calls and emails on this unit netted me no reply. cannot get any tech help so you are on your own with these folks
5,Does everything I wanted and more,"Good experience from the gitgo. Product arrived rapidly from Amazon. Program did everything I wanted, and more. I am not a computer expert and the manual was a bit ""above"" me. The equalizer was their excellent tech support. I have talked to them at least five times finding them pleasant, knowledgable and understandable. A welcome departure from the tech support from some other companies that have outsourced their tech support to foreign countries.I give their program and support and big plus.JOJ"
1,This program is EVIL.,"To be fair, I used version 8, but I lost several YEARS worth of work after installing this piece of garbage, and I want to cry. Yes, I got a full and complete backup first, onto DVDs AND onto a separate drive, but the first DVD in the series shows a read error, and this program did something to the second hard drive (just for being in the machine) to the point that I can't even format it much less retrieve any of my data from it. This is the worst single personal computer disaster I have ever experienced, and I am no novice: I have been programming computers since the punchcard days.YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED."
3,IT IS O.K.,"THE INSTRUCTIONS WERE HARD TO FOLLOW TO SET UP THE SOFTWARE.AFTER TWO TRIES AT LOADING I GOT THE JOB DONE.WORKED, BUT NOT ALL THAT USER FRIENDLY."
2,No ! Not for me ! Thanks.,"I just wanted my wife to try it on her wrist in a drug-store...Rite Aid,Osco,Walgreen,Eckerd,don't remember,it was Christmas time.It smelled just OK but after one hour or so it was...gone.That usually happens with cheap fragrances."
5,Great Present,This was my mother in law's fav ..so I found it with you ..thanks so much ..It was a hit!
1,Aluminum?,Really? Aluminum? Why would anyone spend this much money on cookware that contains aluminum? I can poison myself much cheaper than this thank you very much!
1,Don't waste your money!!!!,"Although these pans look good and are heavy pans they are horrible to cook with and clean! In order to cook without items sticking to the pan, you must use an incredible amount of oil. Also, even with careful hand cleaning and using barkeepers friend, you CANNOT keep these pans clean."
1,Very disappointed--don't buy it!,"I bought the all-copper huge 16 inch pan with wedding money and was so excited to use it after all the reviews but it's terrible. I just gave it one more try and I realized what a waste of money it was. I followed all of the directions, used medium to low heat, and didn't use salt. The inside is totally discolored after cooking and scrubbing the hell out of it. When you cook you will use lots more oil because it all kind of pools to the outside 2 inches of the pan and the food absorbs all of it! This sucks and I'm going to try and return it to Bloomingdales tomorrow. Don't buy it!"
1,all clad stainless steal cookware 10 piece,"I am greatly disappointed with all clad stainless steal, it not only reacted to the food, discoloring the pan but it was almost impossible to clean. I did not use high heat just medium, and on one account with the medium skillet I used just under medium heat and still got the same terrible results. I used everything all clad recomended to clean the inside of the pans and it still took me all the elbow grease I could muster to clean the stupid pans. Don't waste your money these stink, I will take them back."
4,VALLEY OF THE KINGS OF FRANCE,"This is a well researched book with crisp images. The Loire Valley is like a mystical place, with Fairy Tale palaces and a lovely country side, it's no wonder French kings chose this area to hold court. Most of the Chateaux have an Italian bent, since the Italians at the time were considered the most enlightened. No doubt Chambord is the most spectacular, it may have never held the significance Versailles held and it is not blessed with a Le Notre garden, but it is a site to behold, no other castle can touch it, I love the story that Leonardo may have designed the staircase while he was a long term guest of the King, either way it is simply stunning. I high recommend this wonderful book, on a breathtaking subject."
2,"Great info, bad fiction","The basis of the book is fascinating, but for the reader (or at least this reader) the execution is lacking anything more than a little hope that eventually the book will get good. The factual information presented is intriguing but it gets lost amidst a cliche love story that reads a little too much like a cheap romance novel. Ultimately the message the authors were trying to present would have been better played out through non-fiction -- they seem to write that well -- or with the help of a stronger editor."
1,"wanted serenity, not a dance party",was looking for a calming dvd for my kid to watch as she fell asleep. and instead of sleeping she was dancing around. major waste of money....soothing sleep is NOT an accurate description. and most of the photos were not very soothing either.
2,THAT'S HOW MY COOKIE CRUMBLED! A DISAPPOINTMENT!,"Prior to my purchase of this cookie sheet I was totally devoted to All-Clad cookware. But, this cookie sheet was a real wake-up call!The first time it was used it buckled. Ever try to bake gingerbread men on a buckled sheet?Further, the bottoms were black before the cookie was done. The first time, my assumption was that I had somehow erred although we have used this same recipe for a number of years. No, I didn't err - the same unhappy results with the second batch.Frustrated, I pulled out an old inexpensive cookie sheet and the results were perfect.I had thought All-Clad was perfect - it isn't."
3,"Not standard 3"" pulls","NIce looking pulls, but are not the standard 3 inch ones. If you are using pre-existing holes, measure to make sure these will work."
1,"5 Star Performance, 0 Star Recording","This is an excellent performance by Alan Mandel who, throughout these 3 discs, shows an uncanny ability to bring out the melody from within even the most convoluted Ives' piece. Unfortunately, most of this recording is distorted and noisy when the playing gets loud. All of the Studies on CD 1 contain distortion well beyond any professional recording I've ever heard (the 2 sonatas don't suffer from the same fate -- they appear to be from a different session). The fact that Vox goes on about their 20-bit digital mastering on the back of the box sure looks like they are ""protesting too much"". This is all a real shame for Ives fans because Mandel's playing is some of the finest Ives piano performances I've ever heard, plus, here in one place at a great price, are arcane pieces well worth hearing. (It's almost worth getting for that reason, but, in the end, you're stuck with fine music that's distorted and noisy.)"
4,"Fine medical melodrama, very heartfelt.","This is a wonderful screen adaptation of the classic novel that deals with a Doctor in Great Britain as he struggles with the entrenched medical establishment. The film is dated, of course, and may be a bit slow for modern tastes. The lead actors are mostly fine in their roles, although Robert Donat as Dr. Manson seems to be somewhat conflicted in his motivations. Rosalind Russell gives an excellent performance as Dr. Manson's highly-principled wife. Ralph Richardson does a great supporting turn as a flawed physician desperately trying to reclaim his humanity. His impassioned plea to Dr. Manson to join him in a preventative care group is one of the highlights of the film. A very young Rex Harrison does a nice job as a society doctor. Overall, this is a highly watchable film with a delighful cast and a relevant storeyline. I would highly recommend this film, especially to anyone in the medical profession."
3,Desert Places: Distorted Facts,I felt the author has not done enough research onthe prevailing political situation in Inida at thetime of her travel. She makes sweeping statementsabout the then ongoing protest against reservation.This is also highlighted by the fact that the bookdoesnot quote references nor is accompanied by abibliography.
4,Dynamic and Interesting,"I'm a Lost Highway/David Lynch/Home Audio fan, so when I read a review on The All Music Guide for this opera in SACD quality I was interested. This recording really takes advantage of multi-channel sound and dynamic range. I'm not normally an opera listener but I did enjoy this one. Some script changes were done because it is an opera. There's no speeding chase scene with Mr. Eddy, but instead a random person throws a cigarette butt on the ground with the ""follow the rules"" angry speech. If you like opera, you may enjoy the quality of this....if you like lynch you may want a home theater with SACD playback to really appreciate it."
5,Disagree with secularkangaroo,"I have read Dr. Shaw's wise, wonderful book and wish everyone I know with kids would read it. I have friends whose lives and households are absolutely dominated by their infants or toddlers - who can't eat, shower, wash dishes, have a quiet evening with their spouses or do anything normal because they are so obsessed with gratifying every want expressed by their small children. We need a return to common sense and Dr. Shaw is just reminding us that we have the power to make childrearing an enjoyable and rewarding experience for everyone involved. Let's stop raising brats!!!Thank you Dr. Shaw!!!"
4,A must-read for anyone who has a child with behavioral probs,"This was a wonderful book, although yes, a little common sense. I do agree that most who are reading this book are probably already doing a great job. I do think though that those who become defensive about his advice may need to think about if it is because his advice rings true?I do not think at all that he believes there is only one way to raise a child. I do think that it is a lot of info that people who are having issues are not ready to hear. Let's stop blaming our kids for everything and start accepting our own roles as parents!For what it's worth, I am a therapist and after seeing many sad children in my office whose parents are pointing a finger at them-- I wish I had had this book to give to them."
3,Worth Reading,"Although this book is not in full agreement with the Bible, my Christian brothers and sisters, it is good in that many of the things the author says confirms the truths of Scripture. It's also good evidence that non-Christians are able to recognize major things which Scripture says is true without having to have had their heart changed by God, and therefore are without excuse when they disobey him."
5,Thank you for this book!,"It's about time that someone finally wrote about how parents aren't ""parents"" anymore - they are so busy working, dating, buying they don't have time for their kids anymore and so, rather than be parents, they try to be their kids' friend instead. This doesn't work and the kids are really suffering for it. They don't know the meaning of the word ""no""; have no tolerance for frustration, can't see others' points of view, and as Dr. Shaw says, they have no empathy. Just this week in People magazine are stories about how teen hazing is getting out of control - these kids can't even see what they're doing. Please get this book for every parent you know, and if you are a parent yourself, please buy it and read it now. We as a society need to hear this call to action and do something now."
3,Good Read,"Well written, easy to read book about what's wrong with parenting practices today. Gives simple solutions that people should already be using but are too lazy or afraid to. The most useful thing about the book is that it gives concise time tables concerning the development of different behaviors. Although I don't agree with everything Shaw says (he seems to assume his readers will be predominantly white middle to upper class traditional families living in the suburbs), he has very good points about the effect of media, consumerism and laissez faire parenting on the development of children."
4,Black and White,"As a single mother with two small children and some very big questions, I found some reassurance reading this book. Like the cover I did find the author uncomfortable with the gray that makes up most of our lives! Of course one should have our partners vetted before taking a stroll down the aisle and certainly prior to creating a living partnership but reality is, if we knew so much ahead, would we dare enter any relationship.What happened to my journey into motherhood, was a fast slide down the years to my early upbringing and that was something I was NOT expecting. Thus many many books later, some questions have been answered and along those lines, this book does do an excellent job, of reminding one of the higher road that is to be taken during parenthood. This road is as the author points out, a hard uphill slog against the stream of survival in the competitive world we live."
3,Good Movie but it smacks of Mormonism,"The movie was very good...but it smacks of the cult:Mormonism. What supposedly was a Bible that Eric was reading looked suspiciously like the book of mormons...We should have guessed this information by reading the title description ""latter-day"" tale. Other than this observation, we, who are Christians,enjoyed the movie. None of the cult's phylosophy was mentioned in the movie. Except for seeing the book of mormons, it could have been a Christian film."
1,Good Christian ethics,Good christian ethics are the only good points about this movie. The acting is poorly done. I have this movie on my stuff to get rid of stack.
3,DVD excellent Movie a 3,I received what I ordered and it was in excellent condition. The movie was not as good as I expected so I rated the movie a 3.
4,Very nice movie!,"Okay, the acting was not so hot, but the story line was great. I liked it, and I'll watch it again! I was just a little disapionted with the lack of good acting because Beauty and the beast is now such an old tale, You'd think they'd come up with something more enchanting, something that would knock us off our seats... Like Lord of the rings; The way they did smeagol! Make a beast using the same method, and get a castle!"
2,better than the worse,I have seen better movies and I have seen worse movies. I have seen better versions and I have seen worse versions. I have seen better plot and production values and I have seen worse. I have seen better acting and...well here is the difference...I have not seen many movies with worse acting.
2,"Nice Effort, Par Outcome film .","i'm afraid that this apt of beauty and the beast is not that good and i loved Pride and Prejudice the latter day version and Charly and the Work And The Glory Films, plus Other Side Of Heaven it had actors that you believed, this movie not so. the actors in this movie were hard to believe, their characters because they were'nt that believeable. they were actually quite funny when not meaning to be I'm sure that's what the screenwriter did'nt have in mind i bet. i hate to give this a bad review but it was just painful to watch mostly, there were a couple of bright spots not many though . this felt like a dress rehersal with the actors fumbling through their parts. nice effort but did'nt make the mark sorry. I liked belle's father he was believeable and the guy playing the beast was good, but those were the only two.Next Time I'm Watching The Disney Version. I'm all for Wholesome Entertainment But it needs to be better in acting , script, etc."
3,Family friendly,"Safe for family viewing although the lines seemed canned. The movie wasn't out of this world but it was cute in a small way. I like that LDS wasn't throughout the film like the LDS version of ""Pride & Prejudice."""
5,Richard Shindell - Love it.,"Richrd Shindell's Blue Divide is a great collection of fresh folk songs. This collection is a comparable with David Wilcox's ""How did you find me here?"" Pick it up and you won't be disappointed!"
5,easy to use with a sturdy cover,I can't believe how ugly the covers are on these calendars when the almanac's cover is always so charming. I also bought the 2007 version a few weeks after using the 2006 one. It's a good product.
3,No so good as i was expecting,"Well:1. The thef of the Royal Ruby : Very silly, and no plot at all. Very weird, i dont know this one is just blah for me....... just Poirot always amazing, but no plot at all. 3 stars2. The Affair at the Victory Ball : This one is a little bit better, more plot and mystery , but still not so good as other poirot episodes. 3.5 starts3. The Mystery of Junter Lodge : This one is the BEST of the trio, good plot, good mystery , well done !!!!!! the end is fantastic , Poirot at his best!!!!!. 5 stars"
2,At Least It Doesn't Weigh Much,"I am grateful that this book is not very heavy, as I found myself carrying it around in my backpack all day yesterday. Other than that, I'm not exactly thrilled with this book. The recipes are indeed oversimplified and generally vague, and leave my wife (who grew up in a Filipino household) and I muttering, ""Wait, that can't be right...."""
1,Don't waste your time,"If you are a rookie at cooking filipino dishes or simply can't cook at all then this book isn't for you-actually this book is more complicated than the other filipino cookbooks I got. I also recommend not get getting books that have bad/neutral reviews. I have found ""Philippine Recipes Made Easy"" by Violeta A. Noriega and ""Filipino Cuisine: Recipes from the Islands"" by Gerry G. Gelle, helpful and PLUS they have excellent reviews!"
3,Not what I was expecting,"After buying this book and looking through the recipes, it seems to me that this book needs to be updated and revised. It could be a wonderful cookbook if the recipes were more detailed and the directions more clear. It's great in that it has many recipes."
5,Looking for Labyrinth,My 12 year old daughter would love to have a copy of this book. The Jim Henson movie is her favorite...it's a great movie with lots of hidden messages. Please put the book back in print. If anyone has a copy please e-mail a message to LadyBlu333@aol.com.
4,Does what it says,"It's an oxygen sensor. Really, there's not much else to say. The check engine light on my car no longer lights up since installing this, so it works.Denso is typically a good product."
5,STEVEN by Steve Madden Women's Tesse Pointed Toe Flat with Buckle,"I bought these in the black and they are my ""go-to"" shoe as they easily dress up or down. I found them to be true-to-size and comfortable, although as with most Steve Madden flats they don't offer much in the way of support or padding."
3,"Great deal, cute shoe, but not perfect","First of all, I got these for about $32 and the same day I saw them on Zappos for $113! So that was very exciting. And the shoe is very cute - polished looking, nice for work.A couple of things to note, however. I got these a half-size bigger than I normally wear, and they're still a little tight. You might want to order a whole size larger. Secondly they wore a blister into the back of my heels after my first wearing. I bought little felt pads to stick inside the heel, which help.Overall, they aren't a super comfy shoe, but they're stylish and a good price."
2,Too confusing,"This is the 5th book I've read on the subject and it was by far the most confusing. I consider myself to be in the intermediate level of handwriting analysis, but still found myself confused at the lack of explanations as to how the author drew his conclusions. Maybe it is for the more advanced student. I certainly would not recommend it for anyone other than someone with advance knowledge of graphology."
5,Seems best bang for the buck,"These pills work great for aiding digestion. I tried a much more expensive competitive brand and decided that these were better. They only have one type of biotic, but that seems to work just fine."
1,"Crash Bandicoot, Xbox 360",Don't know how this game is because it doesn't work. Putting off going through the hassle of shipping it back.
5,Mutineers' Moon,"This book just drew you along till the end, with just enough information to keep you guessing and wondering, could it be real?"
3,It's okay,"i did not like the fact that the main character set himself up as Governor of Eath and from the tilties of the rest of the novels, Emperor? i am big fan of individuality and rights of, but having all goverment leaders studges of the mutineers speak's to the authors paranoia of goverment and it turned me off from reading the rest of the books."
3,Good story. Amateurish writing,"Great story idea even if it stretched my disbelief-suspension muscles at times. Unfortunately, the writing was bad: cardboard characters, too much telling, and overly flowery descriptions tossed randomly into otherwise cut-and-dried prose."
4,Mutineer's Moon,"Weber again has written a fun book. Reminds me of EE ""Doc"" Smith and his Lensman's series."
4,Anime on Mutineers Moon,well i got to the book from the anime-series (looks really great so far und im looking forward to the premiere) which is planned an produced at the moment which made me quiet curious... ...
3,"Buy it for the information, not for the writing style.","Permitted and Prohibited Desires reads like a doctoral dissertation, which is unforgivable, considering it is not the author's first book. There are endless scholarly names dropped, as if to prove she's done her homework, as well as big chunks of poorly-digested Freud, Lacan, and Althusser. A good editor could have cut out half of what's here, which would have given the author space to put in more of her own research.Her research is interesting. It's easy to find information about the aspects of Japanese culture that interest Westerners, but she describes things that do not transplant so easily. She also does a competent job of relating them to Japanese society as a whole.Short summary: How interested are you in Japanese culture? If you want to go past the obvious, buy the book (but be prepared to wade through some unforgivable academese). If not, spend your money on manga."
5,Boys and their toys,"This awesome towable easily holds 4-5 young boys. When pulling it behind the boat, it is perfect! Pulling it behind a jet ski was scary as 2 boys didn't weigh enough and they flew like a kite, literally 5 feet in the air. It's a hit for tons of water fun. It's not the easiest to store at a whopping 8 feet though."
5,Accept no substitute,"Good set for a decent price, will do just about anything you need it to do. If you don't get the set, the one piece here that I use all the time and love love love is the large saute pan. Cooks evenly, looks great, feels amazing to use."
4,"Good Battery, Fatter than Standard Battery","This battery is the extended life battery for Samsung A970 - it doesn't say so on the product's page but this is the fatter battery that does not fit perfectly on the charger. You can hold it on with a rubber band without much hassle, and if you have the original charger you can disconnect the battery from the phone and side it in the back charger, but that's kind of a pain.It lasts a long time, and actually with the slightly bulkier A970, it kind of fills it out a little, and balances it while the screen is out."
3,'Hogwatch - For A Few Rashes More' (Uhck) Various Artists,Exactly the very same track listing as the 'Son Of Ham' various artists CD release(see my review).Would many partons actually purchase both titles STRICTLY for the two different covers?I have to ask.
5,"Adorable puppy, perfect for Baby","This adorable pink puppy is a perfect baby gift. Paired with the bigger version (also sold on Amazon), some other puppy-themed baby accessory, or with a ""Pat the Bunny"" type book, this stuffed animal is perfectly cuddly."
5,PRECIOUS!!!!,"We bought this like guy for our 9 mo. old grandson because big sis Maggie was given the pink one for her first Christmas. Maggie is 3 yrs. old now & her ""doggie"" is holding up very well. This is sweet, soft, the best of Gund!"
5,Bought for 1st born as lovey,My daughter is now 2 and she loves her puppy. It is a perfect size for her to carry around and love. I bought 2 of these in case one is lost or in the wash. But as it turns out... she now has both in her crib.
5,excellent dovey,"My six month old baby boy LOVES his blue. He reaches for him and it immediately smoothes him. It's very soft, he loves to rub and ""eat"" his ears. I would highly recommend it.update: A year later, ""blue"" still my son's favorite thing in the world. I washes great on the washer with his clothes and still look like new. Can't say how happy I'm with it."
2,"not ""medium"" for kids beyond preschool","This dog is cute and soft, but not ""medium"". My son saw a picture online, and I tried to describe the dimensions. When it arrived, it was smaller than I had expected. Hopefully on Christmas morning, he won't be as shocked as I was."
4,good servo,"This is a decent servo, I bought this thinking it would fit the claw I got from spark fun, but it didn't. It is a good servo though."
3,Could be the best post nuclear war movie,"Since 'Threads' is difficult to find in a format playable in the US, here is a link for a low rez version:[...]Though the video quality is poor one can get the jest of the movie.Although tense and at times difficult to watch, I still think better serious nuc doomsday movies are 1959's 'On the Beach' or the 1984 Canadian docudrama 'Countdown to Looking Glass'."
1,No Relief?,"One question. Why doesn't the rest of the world send relief? I mean, months pass and we're supposed to believe that Italy or France or Switzerland or Argentina or Japan or nobody sends food and medicine and fuel to Britain after a nuclear attack? That the whole world collectively shrugs? Come on. Relief would have began arriving in a matter of days. Oh, wait, reality would have spoiled the director's anti-war political statement."
4,good quality,amazing case with great quality and beautiful color. I would recommend it to my friend. I love it very much.
4,Good product,"Very pleased with the iPhone 5 cover and the service. Recommend this cover if you want a stylish cover, however it doesn't provide a great amount of protection if you drop the phone. In other words it is mainly for looks."
2,Cheap at any price,"Didn't realize it didn't offer any front protection. It literally stops at the front edge, rendering it worthless for a full-protection case. Feels flimsy and I ink I could probably break it with my hands. I paid $2.50 but that's probably two full dollars more than it's worth. Shipped very slow too!"
2,leaks,"I bought the vipp soap dispenser because I liked the looks and it appeared to be made of quality materials. I tried using clear neutrogeena liquid soap in it. Unfortunately, the seal between the top and the bottom doesn't prevent the soap from leaking out. Consequently, I have to constantly rinse off and wipe down the dispenser. It has even leaked from the bottom rubber seal. I contacted the company and they admitted that they had had problems with the dispenser and told me that they would send me a replacement that would be better, but I never received the promised replacement. I am very disappointed in the product because it was relatively expensive to purchase."
4,"Great bakeware, hefty price.","I have a small assortment of All-Clad cookware and bakeware, and must say that I love every piece. However, when it's 2.80 USD a square inch, wow, that's hefty.This particular bakeware is very good for bread and cookies. For bread baking, I found this to be a perfect browner; no burning! It's also very easy to clean, and lasts in the dishwasher. I have also found the small size to be perfect for throwing chicken fingers in the over for the family."
2,next time get a for the straps the king kong bundy,it is alriht but the shraps kept on sliping down the sholders
4,king kong bundy big hit,THIS IS ONE OF THE TOP CLASSIC SUPERSTARS IN MY OPINON THIS OVERALL SET IS GOOD THE KING KONG BUNDY CAN BE USED TO FACE ANYWHERE FROM DOINK THE CLOWN TO THE IMMORTAL HULK HOGGN
5,Good CS figures,"This figure is great!It looks alot like ""King Kong Bundy"".His clothes look so realistic.I think they should release a Wrestlemania 32-pack of King Kong Bundy VS. HillBilly Jim."
4,Not-so-well known Chicago harpmen!,"If you love Chicago blues harmonica, you're gonna love this album!. The bulk of the songs (13) feature some of Chicago's not-so-well known Chicago harp blowers, such as Good Rockin' Charles, Big Leon Brooks, Easy Baby, Golden Wheeler and Big John Wrencher, but also features a tasty duet with Big Walter Horton and Carey Bell (""Avenue Stomp""), plus a song from former Muddy Waters sideman George Mojo Buford on the old chestnut ""Don't Go No Further.""These are all studio recordings made in the 1970's, and the sound quality is excellent throughout. The musicianship is also outstanding. All-in-all, this album will give you a good feeling. A nice addition to anyone's blues collection."
2,Edmund Wilson for the Oprah crowd,"Learn all about Wilson's foot fetish, the women he bedded, and the alcohol he consumed. Appreciate such sterling similes as ""Wilson had an empirical, rationalistic mind, ready, like a ship with her steam up, to set out at once on the sea of thought."" Wait for the paperback, and read it quickly"
4,a great air conditioner,this air conditioner is great. i bought one last year. and it has worked fine im my room. if your looking for an air conditioner for a small room i suggest you get this one.
4,good size air conditioner,It's a bit loud but not bad enough to keep you away. I like it for being compact and definitely worth your money.
3,Can't be worse than Carrier!,"I don't actually own this product, but I do want to steer others away from buying Carrier products. I bought 4 of their Visionaire air conditioners two years ago; only one of them now works (and this in a northern climate!) Not only is the product quality terrible, but their customer service is miserable.I'm sure this Goldstar product is a good buy relative to the Carrier product."
2,Swimsuit,"The suit looks as good in person as in the picture. However, I ordered the size that is the same as my last Speedo and was surprised that this suit didn't fit. The bottom fit fine but the bust was HUGE in comparison. I was very disappointed as I always have bought Speedos - but no more."
3,gold tip arrow,"The product that arrived was Gold tip Velocity Hunter 300. It appears to have been mislabeled (several labels overlayed on top of each other, the last of which indicated it was the product on this page). These arrows will work for my purposes, so they will not be returned."
3,G. I. Jane DVD - not the whole package,"I just bought this DVD, as I am gradually replacing my laser disc collection. I was disappointed to find that it didn't have all of the material on my laser disc, which included director commentary from Ridley Scott and deleted scenes. Guess I'll keep the LD and hope Scott's work gets a more complete treatment later. I just looked at the Blu-Ray listing and it seems to be similarly short-changed.I really like this movie. Though not a fan of Moore, I almost always enjoy Ridley Scott. I think anyone who expects ""realism"" from most war movies is destined to be disappointed."
1,ONE SAD SACK,"I didn't check this one out at the theaters, so recently, a friend let me borrow the dvd. Let's start with bald-headed women: Sigourney Weaver in Alien 3-good. Demi-hilarious! She just looked awfully disproportioned to the rest of her face! I found it distracting as hell. How does one get uglier? Shave their head.I found the story lacking any intensity, especially for a Ridley Scott film. The only interesting part of the film is ""Jane's"" brutal fight/confrontation with her Master Chief played by Viggo Mortensen . That's it. After that, the movie slows to a dull combat sequence.A waste of time.One star for Ridley Scott's attempt at good filmaking. That's it."
2,"Poor acting, dialogue, and plotting ruin this movie","This movie could have been so much better had it not pretended to have content. As a no-brain action flick, it can entertain, but getting through the often painful dialogue and pretentious plot take too long. To enjoy this movie, rent it and play Mystery Science Theater 2000 with a group of friends. END"
2,"""You Go, Girl!""","I found this a contrived, formula movie that fits better into a ""P.C. Fantasy"" category. The ridicule, resentment and abuse directed toward the female SEAL is predictable and exagerated, intended whip the audience into a sympathetic frenzy. It's improbability puts it into a league with ""Karate Kid,"" ""Home Alone,"" ""Ninja Turtles"" or some old ""Lassie"" TV films, - where you cheer for the main character, exhalt in his/her finally rising above the cruelty and unfairness, but you know it's all just fun nonsense.Also, the sound track is ""thick,"" - you have to struggle to hear.Great affects, though."
3,G.I. Jane,"Good movie! It speaks to the loyalty, perseverence, backbone and detemination of women in the military. I had it on VHS and wanted to get a clear DVD copy."
4,Hottest Bald Women EVER!!!,"I won't bore you with another review of the content of this movie, instead I will say this...Demi Moore is HOT S$$T in this movie. She is ripped and sexy as hell...Viggo Mortensen is amazing as the Master Chief. I watched this movie at least 5 times before I even realized that it was him and that shows how great an actor he is...The premise is cool also...A women in the Navy Seals...There is no doubt that women can kill just as well as men can...The question is, can they PULL THEIR WEIGHT??? Or another person's weight???This is a great flick for your collection.The best Viggo Mortensen movie in my opinion,A History of Violence (New Line Platinum Series)"
5,Guilty Pleasure,"Okay, so it takes a big dose of suspension of disbelief, but I love this movie. Less than real, more than a cartoon, a hyper-hollywood version of SEAL training, and, for what it's worth, poetry. Demi Moore's fierceness and determination is awesome. Viggo Mortensen's control is creepy cool. Ann Bancroft delivers the devil. The movie is violent, bloody, with little redeeming social value. But it's in good company there, and better than most."
1,Demi does a Jack Palance,"Feminists will unite to watch Demi Moore do one handed pushups for about a half an hour. Later on she gets the daylights kicked out of her for all the psuedo-masochists in the audience. This movie could have lasted 10 minutes, for the story and plot line. In fact it did. When Demi Moore visited Letterman."
1,Lame movie,"The lamest movie ever. The whole movie is fake, of course. Aside from its anti-military MAN message, it's a catastrophe. What's all with the grey, filtered and dark scenes? It was like every scene was strangling me. Dark, grey, color-less and boring. The final scenes were horrible. First of all, the US Navy does not operate Eurocopter Super Puma helicopters (shown being used to rescue the stranded SEAL team) and it also does not operate AH-1 single engine Cobra attack helicopters. It never did. US Army for a while used them in Vietnam in mid 60s before switching to more modern versions of it. The last scene is horrible. Were they filming a disco dance? I think instead shaking the camera like idiots they should have really spent a few more bucks using high quality special effects. I can't give this junk movie any better rating. Zero! Horrible!"
1,Demi Moore's career falls after this movie.,"This movie was catastrophically damaging to Demi Moore's career as a high paid female actress. The point here was that this movie gave an image of Demi Moore as being more masculine,and an image of a man,then her feminine public image. In plain English, she lost a lot of her male fans due to this image,and still haunts her career to this day. May have contributed to her divorse with her ex-husband Bruce Willis,and her fall as a highly paid female actress."
2,"Oh, please!","I think Ridley Scott makes pretty good movies but this one was getting on my nerves. There is no way in hell any woman(unless she is 6 feet 200 pounds power lifter) could get through Navy Seal training. The makers want you to pretend that women are same as men in all ways imaginable and that any woman should be able to perform the tasks assigned to Seals. Oh, and women should be able to take shower with the guys who should act as if she is one of the them. Yeah, right. What planet is he from?"
1,"Ridley Scott's ""Lemon""","I never had the opportunity to see this movie on it's initial release so decided to purchase the dvd.I was looking forward to a good action and some drama for which Ridley Scott is known.We also enjoy Anne Bancroft's acting and her appearance in the movie would be a bonus. My wife and I sat down and watched it and were annoyed at wasting good money on low-fare entertainment.The gung-ho portrayal of the navy is very typical of hollywood, unrealistic and extremely corny (I cringed when the characters all started saying ""hoo-ya"" ). After the torture scene we just felt annoyed that a possibly good story turned farcical and I watched the rest of the movie on fast-play out of mere curiosity. I would give this one star and no more.This was highly dissapointing, the only redeeming part was the opening scene with Anne Bancroft and the end-credits."
3,Decent movie to rent,It's what I expected from the movie when I watched it. An underdog being the 1st woman to try to make it into the Seal team by undergoing vigorous training.
4,Blue Ray. Video decent. Audio not bad,"Well. Blue ray is not perfect as I expected. But comparing to DVD, way betther both Video and Audio."
3,Silly Film Premised Upon a Politically Correct Fantasy,"The scene where Demi Moore defeats a large man in hand to hand combat is utterly ridiculous. The odds against this happening in the real world are next to zilch. Woman are genetically inferior to men when it comes to physical competition and fighting. At the very best, a well trained female might be able to overpower an athletically inferior male. Other than that, when everything else is equal---the woman is going to lose badly.Political correctness and wishful thinking dominate so many of the films released by the leftist Hollywood crowd. GI Jane is simply another attempt to deny reality and adhere to the dictates of the feminist movement. It should be listed as a comedy, and not a serious adventure movie."
1,"this movie blows, dont waste your time or brain cells","The MP5 has a silencer but when one of the so called SEALS or CRTs?? or something fires it, it makes noise as if it does not have a silencer. And how about the training base in the movie. Last i checked the SEAL training base is in Coronado California and is called BUDs. Lets see what else... oh yeah i dont think that Navy SEAL recruits carry weapons during training the second week. The first couple of months or so is physical training culminating in hell week and if a recruit passes this, then they progress to the diving and land warfare phases. SO THEY DONT CARRY WEAPONS AT ALL DURING THE FIRST PHASE OF TRAINING!!!. Anyway obviously i dont recomend this movie because it is fake, stupid and boring and the action at the end is so confusing that i literally got up and left my apartment with the tv still on. By the way Demi Moore sucks and females have no place in the SEAls thank you"
1,G.I. Jane,"The movie is ridiculous in that it is unrealistic. The fact that they created a movie on the first women in the NAVY SEALS is just horrid since women aren't even aloud in combat, never mind the NAVY SEALS."
3,gi jane,"This movie with it's unplausaable plot is a big hit with the police officers in my husband's district. some how bald,muscular and very big implants are still exciting. the best part is viggo morenstein appearance as the harsh but soft hearted master chief. parts for actors that would later go on to be famous. anne bancorft as the texas senator is the best. for some reason the film is filmed in very dark and gloomy light..just like demi's acting"
4,Demi Moore Rocks,this film was great because Demi Moore plays such a great feminist for military fair treatment. i feel this movie shows a lot of angles of the military that we don't see and other political visions of matters that continue to be of importance today.
4,G.I. JANE,"you can't go wrong when the name RIDLEY SCOTT appears on the screen, great movie that kept my attention thru out but could have done away with the last 20 mins cliche"
4,FUN,"A fun movie with mostly realistic seal training. What wasn't realistic others have pointed out. But I do have to say it again: Having heart alone doesn't get you through that kind of intense physical training. A woman of that caliber wouldn't last a day, let alone a week. There are are very few men who can complete that training let alone a plastic surgery enhanced desk jockey."
2,Missing common vegetables,"This book has excellent information on less common vegetables. However, if you are interested in similar information on vegetables that are used on a daily basis, this is not the book for you. Some of the common vegetables missing from this book are tomatoes, corn, spinach, bell peppers, broccoli, celery, and garlic."
4,Immediate thumbs up!,"I just received this book for Christmas after wanting it since it was first released. It immediately satisfied my questions about the bok choy family (try and figure out the difference between yu choy and choy sum if you're not an expert in Asian produce). I also made a recipe for broccoli raab (one of the four names she mentions) and found it very quick, easy, and relatively low fat.I admit, I haven't used it day-in and day-out like some of the reviewers, but upon immediate perusal it has clear pictures and descriptions and recipes that utilize the main ingredient in its 'natural habitat' i.e. Cuban vegies have Cuban recipes, etc.I'm saving the fifth star only because I am still working through the book."
5,not your common veggies,"This covers all the veggies that you see in the store and have no idea what they are or how to cook. Nice explanation of the taste and origin of the veggies you have wondered about. Read some of it at Barns and Nobles but the price was so high got such a good deal at amazon.Vegetables from Amaranth to Zucchini: The Essential Reference: 500 Recipes, 275 Photographs"
3,Disappointed,"I received this book as a Christmas gift from my son. It is a tome of a book and the size and title suggest that it is comprehensive. Not so, when I was searching for bell peppers and accompanying recipes, I was disappointed to find there was no entry at all. For me, this a startling omission, amongst several, for a book that claims to be vegetables from A - Z. This is not to undermine the thorough and scholarly approach to the subject, but I feel it should include all vegetables."
5,the best of my 45,"As an avid vegetable gardener I buy every cookbook on vegetables that comes along, and find (somewhat to my embarrassment) that I now have 45 of them. This is the one that I haul out most often and that I turn to over and over for ideas. Like many other readers, I wish that Ms. Schneider would reissue it with the commonest vegetables included, but other than that it's perfect. I particularly like the free-flowing section that follows the recipes for each vegetable, in which the author gives sketchy outlines of other dishes using that vegetable. Many of my most successful cooking experiments have been triggered by these undetailed, one-cook-to-another sections that give the gist of a dish rather than nailing it down."
4,"Great, but why not complete?","Just swell, but why leave out the basics? Regular vegetables deserve the same deluxe treatment! It wouldn't have been much more work and it's not clear from the title (I'd say zucchini are prettyu common)that only selected vegetables are represented. Other than that, it's great. And well worth the high price."
5,A big hit at Christmas,"This was a big hit at Christmas. It takes a certain type of sense of humor to appreciate, but my family has that type of sense of humor."
1,this is nonsense,"This product is a wast of money. You can put any potato on any dish at any place and wait and see.The eyes of the potato will sooner or later open and sprouts will develop. In a dark cupboard they will be light coloured and very elongated, seeking for light.Only a modest amount of light is sufficient to keep them short. In the course of a few month the tuber will wrinkle and the sprouts will grow taller (a few cm) and this sprout is fascinating to watch!It is a miniature plant with lots of morphological variation, depending on the cultivar used.Some display pink, purple or blue pigmentation. Some display soft hairs. Some are cylindrical or tapering or round, with our without side-sprouts developing.Anything you need is a potato and no other product!"
3,great price but there are some drawbacks,"This is good but be aware that the German mass on this recording was recorded in 1962 and the rest of the masses in 1978. The sound quality isn't the best in the world but I'm sure to most people it will be tolerable. It's just that after hearing such good quality new recordings it's kind of hard to stomach an old analog recording.The performance is good, probably not the best though. The singers seem to really over power the instruments. some times the instruments just seem a little small. There is some background noise just like on most recordings but it's nothing terrible.I actually recommend the Brilliant Classics Schubert Masses. The sound quality is much better in that box set and it only costs a couple of dollars more."
3,Tintin Hits it in Spanish!,Great conversion of the classic Herge novel. When comparing to the English and French version this version fits in well telling the story as wonderfully as the other languages.
2,The Complete Idiot's Guide to Screenwriting,"Skip Press has made a career out of giving screenplay advice and listing agents, but none of his stories has been made into a film and he seems incapable of providing tips for writing a good movie. This superficial book gives you formatting information but little else."
5,Screenwriting,The seller said exactly what was amazing/wrong with the book. They told the truth and thats all i ask!
5,Complete Idiot's Guide to Screenwriting,"As a very new and hopeful screenwriter, Skip's book became an extremely useful resource for understanding how the business functions, numerous locations/addresses for web site resources, and relevant examples and samples to get you pointed in the right direction. When you finish reading the last page, Skip's willingness to teach and guide doesn't stop. Unlike others, Skip provides continuous ongoing flow of real-time information through his companion newsletter to the book. This keeps the inspired screenwriter going with valuable tips and crucial leads. I can't imagine any new screenwriter not wanting to take advantage of Skip's book and his newsletter. I will keep Skip in my mind as I discuss my humble beginnings at the award shows.Cliff Shorr"
4,Great buy,"This is a very good book for those thinking about or first starting with screenwriting. The author is very informative and, even better, is gracious enough to respond to questions you may have. Thanks, Skip."
2,A good place to start?,"If you decided that you wanted to be a screenwriter, but didn't know the first thing about it, this book could be a good place to start your inquiry. Skip begins with some basics about story structure, then moves on to specifics about screenplays, screenwriting, and Hollywood. This is NOT ""Everything you ever wanted to know about screenwriting"", nor does it try to be. However, Skip does refer to some of the best books and web sites that will help expand your understanding of the topic. The tone of the book is light and breezy, and the information is broken up so you can read it in little chunks like a magazine. Don't take it too seriously. As is the case with practically all of the ""Idiot"" books, it's designed to be a fun overview."
3,More that just the book...,"Okay, so it's not the-end-all-be-all when it comes to screenwriting books. Honestly, I've found more useful information in McKee's ""Story"" and the can't-live-without ""Screenwriter's Bible."" But for anyone wanting to learn more about a career in screenwriting (especially those just starting out), Skip's two books -- ""The Complete Idiot's Guide To"" and the ""Writer's Guide to Hollywood"" offer two invaluable things that the others don't: an easy to understand format with good, identifiable examples of craft and the business end of it all, and, secondly, continued support after the sale.Skip has always made himself available to the creative community with support, insights and a helping hand. That is more than most people do in this or any other business.Well worth checking out and certainly worth adding to your bookshelf.(This review is also posted for the ""Writer's Guide to Hollywood"")"
4,Great Screenplay writing book,"The Complete Idiots guide to screenwriting, by Skip Press, is a great book for the beginner or novice writer, wanting to do some brushing up. For the reviewer, that mentioned that Skip really didn't get into the proper formating of the screenplay, there are pc programs that do that automatically, the great thing also about this new edition, it comes with a CD of trial programs, and some sample scripts.He covers the history of the screenplay and moving making, which I found to be very interesting, also his samples of some script pages, with examples, showing how some writers, write their screenplay. Some people, would probably be happy getting done with a first draft. Mr. Press, explains why this is a bad idea, and covers many more of the how tos, and advice on the pitfalls of Hollywood."
5,Great ideas and movie history,I really liked how this book added movie information from an insider. Narrative story history was interesting too.
4,very nice looking,i have no problems with this display. very sleek and thin. refresh rate seems great. no dead pixels.all in all - I feel I got a great deal :)
5,Worth it!,"The price of this pan threw me, but I decided to give it a try since the cookware is so good. The pan is the best I've ever used. It doesn't stick, it cleans up quickly, and it's true, you CAN use metal utensils in it. I've had the pan for almost a year, and it looks, and bakes, as if it's brand new, even though it is used constantly."
4,Synchronized Swimming - Grace on and under water,"BEGINNING SYNCHRONIZED SWIMMING by Becky Spears, Ph.D. Department of Health and Physical Education, Brooklyn College, Brooklyn, New York. The material in this book presupposes that the instructor is familiar with basic swimming techniques, swimming strokes and plain diving. It also presupposes that the instructor has a sense of rhythm and a basic knowledge of musical form or the willingness to become familiar with it. The primary purpose here is to present sufficient material and procedures to enable the reader to begin synchronized swimming in his own aquatic program. -Adirondack Jack, Northwoods Bookshop"
2,Not for public use!,"My sister (age 40) actually wears turbans in public from time to time, a la Cyd Charisse. I bought her this turban without seeing it in person, and had it sent directly to her for Christmas. Her comment: ""This is a ridiculous turban! I'll wear it in the tub."" Upon pressing her further I learn it's cheap feeling and not as nice to look at as the pictures. So, if you want a turban for a costume or in the tub, go for it, but it's not for public wear."
2,cancerlady,"For the amount of money these products cost I was not impressed with all of them. I ordered the 9 piece set and other All-Clad items. Under the impression they were made in America I found they were not all made in America but in CHINA. The set is nice, looks good and seems to cook nice. Beware of lids, made in CHINA, as the handle does get hot even though advertised cool touch handles. The lids do not have the same quality as the rest of the set. I had ordered in all 18 pieces of All-Clad of which only 5 pieces were made in America. The other 13 pieces were made in CHINA and they do not have the same quality. I CANNOT recommend this product to anyone.All-Clad 5000-9 Stainless 9-Piece Cookware Set"
4,"Great Quality, Good Performance","The title says it all. One thing I notice is compared to my aluminum pots, the stainless takes much longer to boil the same amount of water. So, when I am in a hurry, I keep reverting back to my old aluminum (non-stick). Besides--less cook-time saves energy which is better too.Rethinking my decision, I would have purchased the LTD or the aluminum finish for better performance or Calphalon One, because the anodized interior is supposed to have less stickyness. But, Calphalon is supposedly not dishwasher safe, so there is a trade-off there.I have run a number of pieces through the dishwasher at least forty times with no problems and they come out clean enough. If you put them on display, you probably are going to want to hand-rub the pieces while wearing white gloves, but I could care less about trying to impress anyone that way. Instead, I try to impress them with my cooking."
1,disappointed,"I waited and saved for quite awhile for this All Clad cookware. Now disappointed. The handle is annoying with the long grove - difficult to get a good grip. Also, doesn't feel like it is sturdy enough and cleaning isn't as easy as I had thought. Disappointed."
5,All-Clad is the way to go.,"The pots are worth every penny. I used mine for the first time last week. Damn, I think they will last a few hundred years, lol."
2,Over priced - worthless warranty,"Not a terrible bad product, but way over priced for what you get. Not much of a warranty either. If you buy any All Clad products don't count on the warranty - it's there to convence you to buy the product not support it. I recommend looking at the Calphalon products. There waranty is bar none and the products are as good as All Clad if not better."
2,Burnt food and no time to clean...,"I love to cook and have been cooking for years. I got this set as a wedding gift as well as an individual wok and small frying pan. Before opening the set I cooking on the individual pans for six months. I hated it from the get go! Thankfully, this was a good test and I returned the larger set. Understanding that you need to learn how to cook on stainless....but really, who has time for this, the food burns quickly, and who knew it's not ""non-stick"". These pans are impossible to fry an egg on, make pancakes or prepare a stir fry. So what's the point? Very frustrating, not to mention, impossible to clean. Save your money, buy non-stick!!!"
4,A regular tarot beginner's book.,"This book starts with a good general introduction to tarot, with a bias toward the Rider-Waite deck, which makes it a good book for beginners.It continues with the author's own variation on the celtic cross - most authors do that, but I wish they would either invent original relationships spreads or at least not invent new variations of the same spread,The book then continues, unsurprisingly, to give the meaning of each card in each position and when being reverse or straight.The meanings are good, though not original or exceptionaly good. I wish the author would at least explain the system by which s/he arrived at those meanings - it would make memorization that much easier.All in all, I think it fairs well in it's area and delivers what one would expect from the title, but would recommend it only to beginners."
2,"DON'T BUY THIS THING, ESPECIALLY FOR THIS PRICE","If you're going to spend this kind of money, then get something else. This TV's sound is terrible. It works acceptably for routine network programs, but for stereo broadcasts and VCR/DVD playback, it reeks of dead skunk. You have to keep increasing the volume, which then serves to blur what you're trying to hear, and people who are watching continually ask each other, ""What did he say?"" For this price, far better products are available. I definitely wish I had not bought this one.And yes, the microscopic little buttons on the remote are a pain in the derriere too. This TV/DVD/VCR system looks a lot better on the department store floor than it functions in your home TV room. Don't waste your money or time with this thing."
1,Deflated repeatedly,"This product was wonderful for tge first 2 days. It was firm and not wobbly like a waterbed and i was jappy with it. By the third day, there was a leak which we patched, reinflated and found another leak which was patched as well only to reinflate and discover another leak. We got tired of patching. Not satisfied at all."
3,Disappointed,Product lost form and air after 8 months of limited use. Disappointed in product...significant cost with very limited use. Because of lower back issues we need a dependable air mattress.
5,Big Al,I enjoyed this DVD almost as much as my grandchildren. They have watched it from beginning to end at least 3 times since I got it. I highly recommend it to anyone interested in Dinosaurs.
5,Excellent,"This is one of the very few DVDs I can stand to watch with my sons! It's educational, and very cool. It is a bit graphic and violent at times, as my sons are only 19 months and 4 years, but they enjoy it and ask for it every single day. My older son will play with his dinosaurs while watching, and my younger son requests it by growling like ""Big Al"" as he's become known in our house! Even my husband enjoys watching this one. I plan to buy more in the series as my sons get a little older."
4,Well researched prehistoric ballad,"This dramatic narrative follows the life of actual Allosaurus, Big Al, from an egg to the corpse of a fierce hunter. Even though the filming skips about Al's life, the flow of the production is hardly damaged. The research for the film is impressive; even the Allosaurus fight has some evidence from Al's fossils. Superb computer graphics and animatronics create the believable dinosaurs. There is suspense,action and tradgedy,as well as humor and fun woven into the story.One negative comment is with the location of the filming. It is filmed in Utah and Arizona,which do not look quite accurate,but the extensive research and realistic dinosaurs balance it out. This good short film lets the viewer experience how a dinosaur may have lived."
2,Been a month since I ordered and still not recieved,"Strange that I ordered this dvd on July 3rd and still have not recieved it. It's now August 2nd and it is not even due now to arrive until the 14th. Bad service is one thing. inability to deliver is another. what's up, my son is sitting here waiting for a present that may never arrive.... Sad :("
2,"Disappointed that footage is same as ""Walking with Dinosaurs""","Walking with Dinosaurscontains the same footage (different soundtrack and voice talent, Kenneth Branaugh is MUCH better than Ben Stiller) as Prehistoric Planet. This is NOT called out on the box or description. Since I already own ""Walking with Dinosaurs"" I would not have purchased this DVD if I had known.However, if you have children under 10, this version is more appropriate for little ones with short attention spans than the orginial."
5,Incredible - must have for anyone who loves solo piano,"I bought this 3-CD set 10 years ago since it was cheap and I liked ragtime.What I obtained was far more. Before, I had never heard of Griffes, Antheil, Cowell, and other composers featured on this track. The set is almost a snapshot of American music (as the title says, up to 1945), with romantic, modern, jazz, and somewhat postmodern pieces arranged chronologically (at least in style).Shields' performance is that of a virtuoso, and I agree with the previous reviewer here on Amazon that it is baffling that he did not have more of a recording career.I have hundreds of classical CD's, and the majority of my collection are piano works. Chopin, Rachmaninov, Prokofiev, Beethoven--I like the whole range. Yet these 3 CD's remain one of the jewels of my collection, easily one of the 10 I would choose to keep if I were forced to discard the rest of my classical collection."
3,You cannot control this AC WITH A VACATION POWER TIMER,"The AC is fine except for one thing... it can only be turned on and off by use of the remote control and or the on-unit push switches. I.E. If you set the temperature and plug the unit into one of those timers that have the nibs that over 24 hours, will turn power on and off, you will have no luck operating this (and probably many other) modern AC units. Turning on the power only serves to turn on the Infrared sensor, you still have to physically push the buttons to make the AC unit cool the air. This makes this a very poor choice for those who travel and need to keep a room cool while on the road."
1,Poor Design,This charger has not worked well since the day it arrived. It has an additional piece that goes between the adapter and the palm unit. You have to constantly fiddle with it to get a connection. We ordered a travel charger (also available on Amazon) from another manufacturer for half the price. That one works perfectly.
4,Well good,"Yea after listenin to this whilst trying to revise I think it can be safely said that this album....is bare good, and hasn't moved from my stereo since I bought it (...). Played guys, all the best n ting innit. Lat0rzzzz"
1,""""""" COUNTERFEIT / FAKE / PIRATE COPY DVD """"""""","TERRIBLE PRINT, COUNTERFEIT / COPY OF ORIGINAL / HORRIBLE HORRIBLE COLOUR !!Well not even a original to be honest. So much for spending money on this low classed copy, pirate.I hate the picture print / colours are dull.The whole DVD is a total loss. Such a waste of my money, should have tried another buyer.NOT AT ALL HAPPY. My TAPE/VIDEO ORGINAL that I own is an original, so much clearer and fine quality print than this DVD. You can totally tell the difference between the two, which is original authentic and which isn't - that is this DVD.I wanted to own a DVD also, as I am a great fan of this movie since I was little.DO NOT BUY THIS ! BELIEVE ME YOU WILL REGRET YOU PAID EVEN A CENT ON THIS.THIS SELLER SHOULD BE BANNED FROM SELLING PIRATE COPIESObviously this seller will write against me, as he's the one selling it !WELL ITS YOUR LOSS IF YOU PURCHASE THIS, UPTO YOU VIEWERS...Sorry, but I really hate this DVD horrible copy."
1,"Terrible, terrible","While the box says ""10 to 110"" as far as ages go, what this really means is that it will take you from age 10 to 110 to figure it out. The box also says illustrated step-by-step diagrams and instructions are enclosed. This is NOT true. This is labeled in the most bizarre fashion. My son is 12 and have put together, since he was 4, complex Lego models, Playmobile castles, etc. with NO problem at all. Some of these are labeled for 16+ and they are easy for him. This is a piece of junk. The wood is delicate like a paper airplane and it easily splits, chips and breaks as you ""attempt"" assemblage.This company produces plenty of other good products, but this is NOT one of them. This is not for a child at all and even with adult help, it was nearly impossible and definitely not fun. Additionally, to get the results of painting on the box, you would need to paint certain parts BEFORE assembling or have the patience and skill of a matroyshka doll master painter.DO NOT BUY this product."
2,Interesting recordings but with less peaks than lows !,"I must confess I am not a Brendel fan , but I must recognize the only composer he plays with interesting approach to my taste is Schubert and certain pieces .His Wanderer Fantasie is the best of the set . And notice we are talking Brendel in his thirties ,There are best Musical moments Paul Badura Skoda and Schnabel.The Fantasie at four hands with Schiff is by far too much better . And the set of Impromptus has in Artur Schnabel, Edwin Fisher, Dinu Lipatti and Badura Skoda better performers.Only recommendable for Brendel fans."
1,Very Poor Quality,"This is a cheap copy of a video. Lots of intereference, poor quality. Even the cover looks cheap! Looks like a poorly designed ?illegal copy. Reported to Amazon and they sent another copy which was just as bad. Don't buy...it is a waste of money! Incidentally I love this movie but will not keep such poor quality!"
1,"If you like simplistic fables, this is for you","While this is loosely based on the transition that occurred at Burt's Bees as it changed from a candle company to a beauty products business, the transformation of the simplistic straw woman at the center of the fable seemed unlikely. I dislike overly dumbed-down stories. Why do fable writers choose not to use contractions?Some sentiments ring true, but in general this smacks of the unbelievable. Skip it or get it from the library. Fish! is more believable and a better read."
4,Cool Disc,"If you were born in the 60's, there's a good chance you heard your parents listening to a few of the original versions of some of these tunes. To hear them revamped is quite a treat. The lounge version of ""Black Hole Sun"" was what prompted me to buy the disc, and the whole CD is a fine blending of ""old meets new"" smothered in this cool, smoky, loungy atmosphere. If you like lounge music with a little more modern twist, you'll like this disc... 'tis a cool idea executed quite nicely."
4,Mix Bag with Mixed Results with Black Hole Sun the tops!,"The single song that's worth getting the whole CD for is ""Black Hole Sun"" as so aptly covered by Steve and Eydie (yes Steve Lawrence and Eydie Gormet) the arranger is to be congradualted for his stunning success at turning the Soundgarden grunge mega hit into an astonishingly wonderful Las Vegas Lounge anthem. Steve and Eydie are impeccabled in their ability to do this type of lounge music and the song just continues to astonish me and pretty much everyone that hears it. The soulful suave and polish of this tune is superlative while the sincerity makes this work so well.This is a very unusual CD compelation it trys hard but missed the mark in a few cuts while it hits homeruns in others. The mixture is eclectic so what I loved others may just hate."
4,Whatever,"This is a pretty fun CD featuring contemporary performers paying tribute to lounge music. Although some of the tracks feature older performers like Steve and Eydie. In fact, Steve and Eydie's lounge-ish version of Soundgarden's ""Black Hole Sun"" is the best track here (it's a hoot!). I also enjoyed most of the other tracks, which mostly feature modern artists doing songs associated with the lounge era. Not all of them work, but a high percentage of them do. Fans of the lounge music revival should enjoy this CD."
3,Music to ponder...,"An interesting variety of performers...some songs were better off in their original version, but there are some really creative re-makes: I really enjoyed Steve and Edie's version of ""Black Hole Sun"" and Ben Fold's Five take on ""She Don't Use Jelly"". The album on the whole takes some getting used to, but it's worth it, if you want to try something different."
1,Guess Who Steals The Show?,"This disc is a miserable testament to the excesses of Gen X (my generation) retro. Nothing happens here that isn't wrecked by the wink of an eye that says, ""It's all kitsch, have fun!"" Well, as any John Waters disciple knows, true kitsch can't be made with anything but the most serious intentions. So, guess who comes out looking best? Steve Lawrence and Edie Gorme who sing the hell out of ""Black Hole Sun"" as if Irving Berlin wrote it specifically for their Vegas act. Listen and learn alterna-folk and your career might span decades instead of sputtering out on fads and insincerity. BTW, it's 2009, where have half of the people on this disc disappeared to?"
3,"Uneven, but the highs are very high","A mixed bag, unfortunately -- no cuts are as good as the first two (Combustible Edison rules!) and to some of these artists Lounge = ""smarmy self-indulgence"" (especially Poe)."
2,Interesting translations...,"Another curious release, Queen songs performed entirely in Spanish! Why then is the one Queen song in which some lyrics were written in Spanish (""Las Palabras De Amor"") not included?Since it is a beautiful language, the ballads here shine such as ""These Are the Days of Our Lives"" and ""Love of My Life"", I can listen to these over and over.Then you have the crap. At first I thought the version of ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" was fun. Now all I can think of is that if Korn of Limp Bizket (of however those idiots spell their name) sang in Spanish, THIS is how they'd do ""Bo Rhap"". Frightening!Since I know the lyrics by heart, I *can* sing along, regardless if it's in a foreign language.Simply, if you're a Spanish Queen fan, this is the album for you!"
5,Talk About Shakespearean!,"My god, if the world actually works the way Peter Evans seems to indicate it does, all bets are off and all hope is lost.A riveting account of the blinders money puts on morality.Can't recommend it enough, whether you're interested in history or not. This is, at its core, a profile in deviant psychology."
3,Nemesis,"I started off enjoying this book - the high-flying bed-hopping lifestyle of the very rich makes for interesting reading. However by the middle of the book, when the Arabs entered the scene, I had stalled. There were just too many names flying around to keep track of, reading the book became a bit of a chore. I did persevere and once the author had finished detailing his terrorist/RFK hypothesis, my interest picked back up again.This was the first biography I had read concerning any of the major parties - Onassis, Jackie, the Kennedys - so my review is based purely on how interesting and readable I found the book, not how accurate I believe it to be. That I do not know. I have to mention, the author does not paint Jackie in a very sympathetic light! Cold, calculating, greedy are a few words that spring to mind. I am interested now to read other biographies of all three parties mentioned above, to see how they compare."
1,"Pure trash, pure fiction","Hilarious! This is a book for people who believe anything they read in print.... pure trash, pure fiction.Gossip, even invented gossip, is fun, isn't it?"
3,Confusing,"I thought that this book would be interesting to me because I like the Kennedy family and am interested in conspiracy theories, but I was wrong. This book is pretty good, but it is really confusing with so many people involved that sometimes it is hard to keep straight who this person is and what they did."
4,Almost perfect for storage,"I use these inside a temperature-controller freezer full of rare, expensive beers. I tried other solid-sided tubs, but the lack of air movement inside created a lot of mold. The open sides and bottom provide for free movement of air and less chance of mold.The only issue I have with them is that the bottom reinforcement could be a bit stiffer so that it doesn't bow when lifting full of bottles."
5,Blends real history with supernatural overtones,"Emily's new house in London's historic neighborhood is filled with secrets of the past - secrets which bring Emily right into the past as she begins to experience plague symptoms and uncovers a doorway to an era where the Black Death killed almost a quarter of London's people. A challenging, involving story which blends real history with supernatural overtones in a riveting style."
2,Surprisingly pedestrian effort considering earlier books.,"This tale of Robin Hood, set in the immediate aftermath of the Norman Conquest (not the usual Robin Hoodian venue), is altogether slow and uninspiring -- quite a ""come down"" for the author of the Arthurian retelling: ""Firelord"". In Firelord, Godwin demonstrated a real knack w/prose and a marked ability to tell a quick & convincing historical tale (set in legendary times) in a believable, yet contemporary-sounding, voice. Not so here. This Robin Hood character plods along, never leaping into life and burdened by the paces he must go through to advance a thumpingly dull plot. None of the characters, in fact, have much life and so there's not much to tell about them here -- so I won't bother. Suffice it to say that Robin and his companions had more fun in King Richard's time. Just ask Scott's Ivanhoe. -- Stuart W. Mirsky (mirsky@ix.netcom.com"
3,Sherwood,"This is a decent try at a gritty, morally complex work of historical fiction. Godwin has done his research; that he invents Saxon resistance in a specific place seems inconsequential to me, given that we don't know *everything* that went on during the period. He makes at least an attempt to portray mentality, which puts him ahead of most medieval historical fiction writers.There are some issues, though. Godwin's writing, especially in the early part of the book, is often grammatically vague. His fight and action scenes are insufficiently structured, thus confusing. His constant identification of the Saxons with the land conveniently ignores the fact that the Saxons themselves came as invaders. The text sometimes tries too hard to be meaningful.Characterization overall is competent. I found Robin, in his more ignorant, loudmouthed, horse-eating moments, annoying, and tended to prefer Ralf.This is a reasonable book, I'd say, but no masterpiece."
1,Unknown,I don't know if I liked the movie or not because I never received it. What I received in the mail was an empty home security cassette. I contacted the seller but she would not refund my money nor send me the tape I ordered.
2,Written in 2002 in U.K.,"Even though the book shows a published date of February 2005, the writing in the book keeps referring to 2002 as the current date. The book is also written by people in the U.K. for people in the U.K. The parts I did read also left out important data, such that by using canola oil, nitrogen oxides actually decrease. Certainly most of the book has useful information, but for the reasons mentioned, I would recommend to keep looking for a book for the American audience."
4,practical biodiesel for small manufacturers,"Very ilustrative and practical manual, also discuss the taxes and other problems different to production"
4,Great Read,"Book is great if you want to learn how to save money by using cooking oil as fuel for diesel. A little technical, but explained very well."
5,Awesome product,"Bought this as an ebay steal. Works perfectly. Used it to run my 37in tv and cable box on a full charge and it ran for about 2 hours before the low battery signal went off. I only used it on that as a test. I plan to use it as emergency backup for lights and charging cell phones, so the battery should last much longer. If this item becomes available I highly recommend it."
2,Selective reading of prophetic ethics.,"Dempsey looks at some prophetic passages using a liberationist critical hermeneutic. The book begins with a brief but interesting assessment of recent scholarly discussions of ethics in the Old Testament. Dempsey then sets the next stage for the book by discussing creation, covenant, and Torah; all with an emphasis upon relationship as she heads toward embracing a biocentric ethic for humanity. Her focus is selective so the element of blessing is ignored in the discussion of the Abrahamic covenant. The book deals with many short sections from the classical prophets of the Hebrew Bible as Dempsey questions the ethics of the prophets and drives a wedge between the OT prophets (entire Bible) and modern ethics. In the end, Dempsey seems to be searching not only for new metahpors for God but a new God."
4,Like But Broken Straps,"I like the feel of these shoes. I will not say that they overwhelm the feet once you get use to the sensation, for you might want to go on long walks with them on, as I did. Did, I say, because the straps broke on both shoes. I did not play basketball with them on. I just walked, mainly around the house (and twice outdoors on those longer [a mile or so] walks). The weather turned cold, so then no more long walks. Then, once employed back as house shoes, the straps broke. Go figure. Still, I like these shoes. I'll get some glue and repair them."
5,Spectacular!,"My husband was very excited to get this as a gift. He says it's a great series (for adults & kids!). Price was good, and it came quickly."
2,very scratched,bad productvery scratched should have never been resold what a tragedy! have bpoght better. like I said bad disk. enough
5,From back cover,"Over 45 original patterns for cross-stitch and other needlepoints inspired by traditional rymes of Mother Goose, with exciting projects and ideas for the beggining to experienced stitcher of all ages."
2,Can't watch TV & record video at same time,"I returned the MW20FP1 Toshiba TV/VCR/DVD combo because it does not allow you to watch one channel while recording on another. This is because it only has one tuner and when that tuner is occupied recording a program you cannot change the channel.On the positive side, the picture was very good and the DVD and VHS play were intuitive."
4,Good material---but Outdated,"The title of my review says it all: the text and the study guide were fine at the time they were published in 1996, but this is 2004 and a great deal has changed in California's court system from the vantage of civil procedure. The publisher should have updated this book no later than 2000 when the courts were administratively unified; additionally, local and state rules of procedure have been dramatically altered to place greater emphasis on ADR (alternative dispute resolution) and the rules regarding Fast-track litigation have likewise undergone significant changes.In short, a book which purports to teach the nuts and bolts of litigation procedure needs to be revised whenever there are major changes in the procedural law, as has been the case in California.With that said, the examples, the case studies, and the explanations make this Study Guide an invaluable companion to the main textbook."
2,missing important point,"Sadly, few people understand that personality plays a much larger role in the ""differences between men and women"" than gender. I am a woman. Yet my boyfriend is the talker. He vents almost daily. Oh, thank goodness I'm a woman, 'cause I listen. Is that how it works? Please. Learn about personality. Check out LoveTypes.com by Dr. Alex Avila. Or read AlphaDog, Get The Bitch You Want."
2,How to be a nice guy,"This book should be called how to be a ""nice guy"". This book spends many chapters teaching you how to be a nice guy. The data was collected from hundreds of women who described exactly what they are looking for. Sounds simple enough. That's assuming women say exactly what they mean.If you read many other books on this same topic they suggest that women like a challenge. That if you try too hard to be a ""nice guy"", like this book will teach you to be, you will end up with many female friends who do not want to date you for fear of ruining your friendship. While this book is an interesting read, and does contain some useful information do not let this be your only guide. Women just don't go for the type that trys this hard."
5,Awesome,"This is a great volume, especially if you are a Wolfwood fan. By the end it shifts all the attention to Wolfwood, which is very fitting as the next two volumes deal with Wolfwood almost exclusively. The actions great as usual, and not to put in spoilers in this but Wolfwood finally makes his decision about which side he's on."
4,traditional,"I chose this for the same reasons - detailed,imaginative old-style illustration and text although I found the realism rather scary for the intended 3 year old recipient."
1,Too scary for children,"I bought this version of the popular fairy tale as a gift for my niece. After I received it, I was horrified to read in detail about how the huntsman cut open the wolf's stomach to look for the grandmother. It then goes on to read, "". . . after a few more slashes a little girl jumped out.."" This was not at all what I had envisioned as a gift for a young girl. I wish I had been warned to buy the story from a different author."
1,DON'T BUY THIS PIECE OF JUNK,It shuffles your songs and it doesn't have a screen. How can you find what you want? You have a 1 out of 250 chance of getting the song you want. And no screen. Come on. Don't buy this buy tha mini or the new Nano. Just don't buy this piece of junk.
1,IT DOESN'T WORK AT ALL!!!,The Apple Ipod Shuffle doesn't work with a Windows Computer. I spent 4 days trying to get it to work but it didn't. I had also purchased music off of Itunes to get it to work but it was just all a waste of time and money. I think this is the WORST electronic to buy unless you like getting frustrated and you want to waste your money and time.
1,Thanks but no thanks,"No screen and no equalizer for a hundred bucks? Are they serious? Thanks, but I'll stick with my iPod mini."
1,It has no screen,"Welcome to Marketing 101. There are 3000 other players with the same storage, and a SCREEN!!! Haha.. Apple, you almost fooled me. And did you here someone got fired from their company for criticizing the Ipod while interviewed in the New York Times?? Check it out in this months Village Voice, villagevoice.com. Unbelievable. You should be ashamed of yourself Steve Jobbs. Rot in the fiery pits buddy."
4,i love it,"i got this ipod for christmas one year and i was soooo happy!everyone thinks just because it doesnt have a screen that it isnt as good as the other ipods. i think that what you really want an ipod to do is to play music, and thats what it does! sweet and simple. it also like, never has to charge and it is very duable (trust me on that). i would so recomend it for a first time mp3 player"
3,ipod shuffle,"This is a great ""starter"" player. I bought one for my grand daughter, who is 8, and then one for myself, so I could help her."
1,Shuffle clearly poor quality,"My daughter received one of these for Christmas last year. I was aggravated how difficult it was to load songs on the unit. Once loaded I was amazed at how good the music sounded and I started to think the product may be reasonable.Months later my wife bought one for me. I experienced the same frustration with my shuffle. In fact, I did some troubleshooting with the folks at Apple. All six people at Apple started with the 4 R's approach, followed by my USB is defective, then my computer, then my wife's computer. All folks at Apple finally conceded that it was the Ipod. I am about to send my 3rd shuffle back for replacement.My wife got a Nano for herself and it works very well. As for the Shuffle, I would not advise paying a dime for it. After the multiple hours I have spent with tech support, I feel they should have paid me for my trouble for this seriously deficient product."
4,Perfect for infrequent users,"My husband and I each have one of these little guys. They're fun and easy to use and require very little maintenance. It's not ideal for people with long commutes or huge music libraries, but perfect for people like us. We still prefer to keep our thousands of CDs and listen to them through regular speakers when we're at home. The shuffles come out for lawn mowing or workouts, that sort of thing."
5,iPod Shuffle is Great,"This a an excellent player for audio books. It has more than enough space, and is very compact."
1,HORRIBLE SOFTWARE!,"I had several problems with the iPod, mostly because of its horrible software iTunes. It messed up the firmware on the device several times, it would complain constantly that it is not up to date and then try to update it which resuted in several crashes.The most horrible thing however was that it would mess up your MP3 music collection in a way that can never be undone. I had orgaized my collection in the file system nicely by genre, author, album etc, and this thing messed up everything. I have another mp3 player - iRiver - which I reccommend as a lot better than the iPod anyway - and I wanted to be able to copy things on it from my library. Now i am not able to and have to go back and re-organize the mess manually!.I do not recommend the iPod and I do not recommend using their software either."
2,Beware of technical issues!!!,"I bought the shuffle shortly after it came out and liked it so much bought another one for my wife. It's perfect for workouts, but beware! I've had annoying technical issues with it. The unit shuts off at the end of certain songs and requires a reset. I've read up on the Apple boards about it and there is no solution that seems to work for me. It is quite a bummer when this happens in the middle of a workout."
5,wow,i bought this thing yesterday and i was all bummed out because it did not have any screen.I was wrong the shuffle is as good as any other ipod or mp3 player. the music is easy to download and the sound is very clear. this thing rocks!
4,A great entry level MP3 player,It fits my needs exactly. I belong to a barbershop chorus. I put my learning songs on the player and listen to them as I walk each day. In no time I know the songs. Does the job for me.
5,It's Great!,I bought my 12 year old daughter the iPod Shuffle. I wanted to reward her for an excellent report card but did not want to spend alot of money because of her age. The iPod Shuffle is perfect. It is priced much lower than the other iPods. She downloads music and operates it all by herself. She is standing behind me right now telling me how much she loves it!My daughter highly recommends this as a first buy because of it being easier to use and still holds lots of music. A very satisfied customer.
4,I Love This Little Thingy,"it has ASTOUNDING sound quality, i would say that it's better than a cd player's sound quality. AAAANNND it's like eight times less the size of your average CD player, AAAANNND it holds lots of music, the only thing is i would reccomend this product to anybody who is just your average music collector, after all this thing holds 120 songs which some people think is a small amount (not me) but anyway an EXTREMELY easy to use little gadget, took me like 10 minutes to figure out how itunes worked once it got started, very easy to transport songs from CDs to the shuffle. I love this thing and its a great price for a great MP3"
3,I-Pod Shuffle review,"I found the quality of the hardware to be good, and convenient, compact size. However, the software and ease of formatting the unit, as well as adding/deleting songs to the playlist was cumbersome, confusing, and just plain awful. Much harder to use than conventional drop & drag files to most MP3 players. For the money, not a good value."
1,terrible purchase,the product stopped working after one day. i got green and amber blinking lights each time i try to charge it or switch it on.hopeless.
2,"uhhhhhhhh, NO!","I am a confessed musicaholic. I could sit and download for hours. But, why would anyone buy this flash memory player when there are other ones with more features AND a display? I will stick to my Iriver any day. The inline recording feature that it has is remarkable. It really is cd quality. Not that I want to rip off the music industry, but with this feature you can record an album, for instance, off of AOL for nothing. It really is cd quality when you record like this. This IPod can't do that. I think the hard drive Ipod is a brilliant idea, and maybe someday I will get one. But for the money, you can buy another flash memory MP3 player, with a display, with a radio, with voice recording (some may find that useful, I don't) and the inline recording. And they look better. Whats with the boring white? Naah I'm not sold on this."
2,"Apple overestimates the ""aren't we clever"" factor.","I got to play with this the other day. The size and battery life are awesome. Aside from that, the Shuffle is annoying to use. Call me crazy, but I like picking songs. I don't find it in any way a burden. The Shuffle seems less of an entry level iPod as it does an attempt to frustrate users into buying regular iPods after the novelty of the Shuffle wears off. From an Apple enthusiast, dissapointment is my first impression of the Shuffle."
1,Apple has a great marketing staff,..but in this case an inferior product.There are better ones out there with more functionality and better quality.
1,it sucks,"It doesn't have a LCD screen. Although you can customize the playlist, I just can't remember the order of the songs. Waste of money."
1,A piece of junk,I have an ipod shuffle...its a piece of junk. I got it a while ago and listened to it on the bus on the way 2 school.After 1 month it died.And yes i did buy a charger and i tried charging it but it wouldnt work.So i replaced the batteries in the charger...STILL will not work. And thats not the only thing before the battery died the ipod would only allow the headphones to play on one earphone.My parents thought it was the headphones..so we bought a new pair after a while it doesnt work again.I'm planning on returning this piece of junk pretty soon and I've been looking at some ipod nanos.Those look better. If your smart youll start looking at the nanos too.
5,Nice size.,Tiny size is best feature by far. Not having a display is like trying to find a song on my car's 6-CD changer (full of burned music CDs) but I don't know where it is... Getting cool points from co-workers is fun also : )
2,You get what you pay for,"Do NOT buy an ipod shuffle. I've heard that Apple is phasing out this model, which explains the reduced price.One of the main reasons is faulty firmware in the Shuffle. I've only had mine a little over a week and it's already dead. And believe me, I've tried everything. There's a bad habit in Shuffles to go into ""blink"" mode, which means bad medicine. Once a Shuffle unit goes into blink mode, it becomes next to impossible to get itunes or Windows to recognize it. That means no song downloads, no updates, not even any Windows based tech diagnosis.Apple is offering replacements, but the S&H; for the return is $[...], and even then there's no guarantee that the replacement will work any better. My 5 year old Intel audio player is more reliable than this.. thing.Stay far, far away from the ipod Shuffle. I was optimistic, but for only 70 bucks, I guess it was too much to hope for."
3,Geat Little Ipod but...,"Love the item, I'm just mad that 2 days after I purchased it for $94.99 Apple dropped the price by $30 and Amazon would not refund me the difference when I asked. A Walmart or other store probably would have."
5,Best item I ever bought,"I love my iPod Shuffle. I was lucky to get mine as soon as it went on sale. It's another successful Apple product. Well-designed, easy to use, nice-looking--it's a terrific item. It's so small and light too. I had no trouble loading music onto the Shuffle and mine holds 158 songs, even more than Apple says it it's own description. And you can't beat the price."
4,Great Little Thingy,I love it. The sound is great for such a little device. My only grip would be that the earplugs seem a little to big for my ears. Downloading the music is easy. I downloaded my favorite songs from my CD collections and I jam through the day with my Shuffle.
1,Don't jog with this one,"Just like Mark (posting April 5, 2006), I charged the thing up, filled it full of great music, and went out for my usual run. It worked for about a half-hour and then died. Tried everything to get it going again but nothing. Am taking it to the Apple store at the local mall to see if they have any suggestions. Hopefully, I can send it back to Amazon and get my money returned. Sigh!"
2,"No, this is not the cheapest player. There ARE cheaper ones that are better","SanDisk Sansa E100, Samsung YP-MT6, Iaudio U2, Samsung YP-U2, SanDisk Sansa E200, SanDisk Sansa C100, SanDisk Sansa M200, Samsung YP-U1...These are all players that are better than the iPod Shuffle. Some are more expensive, but so much better it's worth it. And there are some that are cheaper, yet better."
1,Get a CD Player Instead If you Like Music,"It's a well kept secret that store clerks and most Apple tech support people don't know that I will now reveal. No matter how much you'd like to improve the tinny, shallow sound that the Shuffle produces, you can't. Spend all the time you'd like on iTunes to set the EQ, it won't do you any good. Of course, I had to work my way up the complaint ladder and roughly 4 phone calls to Tech ""Support"" - their word for it; not mine - before I found someone who said, ""Oh, you can't do that on the Shuffle."" I'll tell you what - save yourself some medication and buy a Panasonic Shockwave CD player instead. It plays MP3 files, costs about the same as the Shuffle and the sound - WOW! NO comparison."
1,cheap / pain in the rear,"I'm a MP3 Player fanatic, my mother got one of these Ipods for christmas and I had to set it up for her.....There are much better mp3 players out there. Very simple to use, plug and play. This ipod makes you do so many things prior to playing, it will drive you nuts. Particularly if you are used to just plugging a player in your computer and listening. This Ipod makes you download software and set up your ipod, where others do not.It is also clunky and feels cheap. Other players less expensive than this give you the ability to see what songs are playing, this one does not.Cheap cheap cheap."
2,Disposable gadget of the minute,"It's funny how Apple redesigns the iPod every 5 minutes. After I purchased the iPod Shuffle, I found out that it costs $10 less than a new iPod Shuffle to have the battery replaced. So this product is basically disposable. Once the battery dies, you throw it away or get a new one.Also, the headphones are permanently attached, so you can't use your own. Other than that it's great."
2,Frustrating Software Isues,"Apple make a big song & dance about ease of use but I found it just wouldn't register with ITunes on our Mac, despite endless messing about with IPod Updates. At each point it would just silently fail to work or occasionally provide a cryptic error such as ""Failed to update IPod Shuffle. (2)"". Gee, thanks Apple.Ironically, it communicates fine with a PC. Once the songs are finally on the device, it works OK."
1,studyed all 6 Ipods..same problesm,"Full user opinionAfter loosing all my music because I wanted to put a cd on my iPod at work one day, I almost threw my iPod in the trash. I looked around and found the iPod killer.This baby does it all plus you get an FM radio and built in voice recorder!Thanks Creative Labs!,,,,,, Sam goodys dosent take Returns only store credit,,,,buy Creative Zen Vision M (30GB, green) better Qulity"
1,OVERRATED PIECE OF JUNK,"Yeah its supposed to be a rugged mp3 player...I get that, but when it cant do simple things like STOP PLAYING at the end of a playlist, you have to wonder. If you want to listen at night to a podcast, it wont automatically shut off or stop at the end. It'll keep looping all night and your battery will be dead by morning. No wonder Apple's products are second rate to Windows...with stupid design ideas like that. Add to that no display, no way of changing the battery and Apple's incredibly RUDE ""holier than thou"" attitude in their customer support department, and you've got an overpriced piece of plastic. Yup, its as big as a pack of gum and just as useful. If you want a good mini mp3 player that actually lets you CONTROL what you're doing, go with either the Creative Zen series or Samsung's YT series, both highly rated. Apple and this stupid product or WAY overrated."
1,Top Ten Reasons to Save Your Money,"The problems with the shuffle are endless.10. If you can get it to work...some computers have serious problems with recognizing it.Thats after the endless hours of updates,support,and rigging9. Once you get it working (kind of) you'll find that shufflelikes a small amount of your songs. Repeats them over andover. Even after you skip them.8. If you put the thing in your pocket (where else) thecontrols will respond to your movements. Like a cameraphone taking pictures in your pocket.7. You can only use it on the computer you install it on.6. Ear buds are one step above the Dollar store.5. Battery's life expectancy 6 months. Price a new one.4. itunes is more of a commercial than it is useful.slows my computer up.3. The daily emails to buy buy buy.2. Quick Time Pop-ups. You can't run itunes with out it.1. Its white!"
1,Don't be taken in,"Don't believe the Apple hype or the ranting by Apple disciples. Comparably-priced players have a ton more features - a display, FM-tuner (great for the gym), voice recorder, replaceable battery, folders to organize tracks on the player, equalizers, shuffle functions, great ease of use, and on and on... And this player is plagued by the common Ipod problem - when the battery dies the player becomes a paperweight. Steve Jobs once said that the only thing flash players are good for are to sit unused in the back of drawers. Well, his company has made one that will fulfill that prophecy."
2,Hype Hype Hype,"This product is not revolutionary by any means as some people would have you believe.It's all hype. There simply are better flash based mp3 players that are equally as small. Have a display, great battery life, shuffle function, fm radio, voice recording, excellent sound quality, and look pretty, and have more codec support, but don't come with all the hype. Creative Muvo TX fm is priced similarly, small, and is much better in my opinion, and also prettier.Don't follow the sheep."
4,iPOD ilike,"I love this MP3 player, it is so easy to use and is so small, granted it does not have alot of music space..like 120 songs, but by the time you go through that many you're ready to replace them anyway. I really liked the way the itunes software works it is so easy to use and it does not look for nafarious music, heaven forbid, and I like the way it just plugs right into the usb port, I bought a better case for it, that was $30, which is just nuts, Apple really prices there accessories high!! I use this ipod to workout and that's all and for that it is perfect. If all you really need is an MP3 player for working out or running then you will love this ipod...I also like the fact it hangs around the neck, I think the arm bands look so 80's, this is not you fathers walkman."
4,Perfect for the gym but...,"iPod Shuffle is the convenient carry-on type MP3 player and the latest entry in the hugely successful iPod line. Though it lacks the LCD color screen its predecessor have, its small size and ease of use is what makes it worth purchasing. It's perfect for a routine workout and it's stylist as well. One suggestion I'd make is that on the back that they put a raised indention bar of some sorts on the adjuster bar because you have to press the slide to get it to move, not just use a fingernail to move it had the Shuffle had something to use for movement on the back."
4,Apple iPod Shuffle- Pros and Cons,"Pros:-Inexpensive iPod-Can store up to 480 minutes of music (960 minutes for the 1GB iPod Shuffle)-Good battery life (about 12 hours)-Small design-Compatable with I-Tunes-""Shuffle"" feature-ability to play your songs in the order you desire (but that takes away the concept of the iPod SHUFFLE ;D ).Cons:-No Screen (If it did have a screen, though, that would take away the concept of the iPod SHUFFLE. Also it would cost more.)-Buttons may be a little too small (At least they function, and that's what matters.)-If you have a big music collection, this iPod is not for you(If you have a big music collection, I recommend an iPod Mini or a regular iPod, or, if you have about 960 minutes worth of music, upgrade to an iPod Shuffle 1GB.)Overall: I'm giving the iPod Shuffle a 4 out of 5. If you're looking for a good quality MP3 player or are new to the music world, this is it. However this may be a disapointment for those with a big music collection."
4,Value for money player,"as the sub says its a gr8 product, the only con can be tht it requires frequent updation for new songs as hdd space is low.."
1,awful product,"This shuffle is awful. The first time we had a problem with it our computer wouldn't regonize it and we ended up getting a replaced. Now the shuffle doesn't let the head phones work except for one ear, we thought it was the headphones and bought new ones but the same thing continues to happen. You are better getting the newer model in hopes they have figured out the problems with the first one."
4,you can get this for a better price,"HAHAHAHAHA GUYS, YOU CAN GET THIS FOR LIKE 70 DOLLARS AT WALMART, AND IT LOOKS EXACTLY THE SAME, WORKS THE SAME, AND PLAYS THE SAME! I was stunned when I saw the high price on here!"
3,"Great for some, not so great for others","If you like to listen to music when you run, workout (or similar type of stuff) or just need long battery life then this thing is great (or as a secondary device to a full iPod). Good battery life and it hooks to your iTunes. Enough said.For anyone else it is a lousy replacement for an iPod. Want to listen to song number 125 out of 250? Well get ready to click 125 times to get to it (or you could wait four hours for the shuffle to finally get around to it). Lack of playlists is a real bummer as well.It is good for audio books. You can only carry a handful books on it anyway so the lack of a screen doesn't really matter.You'll need a USB extension cable if your computer doesn't have a sizable clear area around the USB port.Considering what the Shuffle COULD have been it is quite disappointing. Considering what it IS it may be great or terrible depending on how you intend to use it."
4,I love my ipod shuffle!,"The ipod is easy to use. The battery lasts and lasts. It holds more than enough songs for me. It is the most compact ever, the size of a pack of gum. It's one of the best investments I've made for $99!"
1,Terrible productand support from Apple,"If this product is indicative of Apple quality and customer support than it's the last Apple product I'll ever buy. After only very limited use, the Shuffle won't playback. I did everything that Apple says to do to restore the software, but nothing works. You can't contact Apple by email, so you can't tell them what tou think. P-Poor product and Support. Down with Apple!!!"
1,"Over priced, lacking features","I bought it because Otter Box makes a waterproof case for it and together they make a low priced waterproof MP3 player. The Otter Box is great. If not for the Otter Box and my desire to be able to swim with it, I would choose something else. For the same money one can buy one from Creative. The Creative one has a display, uses standard AAA batteries, allows one to play music by album,skip albums or just find a particular song or album, which without a display the Shuffle is incapable of doing. The switch on the back does not have a good detent to allow choosing between shuffle and sequential play. If you only want to hear music in random order, do not desire to see what is playing, have to use one internal battery which needs a USB cord or special charger to charge, buy the Shuffle. Otherwise, think about a Nano or some other MP3 player."
1,..Disappointed..!!,I bought this device to send it to India for my little niece...good that I have tried to load songs here..it was absolutely not functioning..I tried to fix it for 6 hours and finally returned it..very much disappointed..
2,Kinda dissapointed.,Doesn't hold alot of songs. The most mine will hold is 64. Wouldve spent more if I thought it held more songs.
4,great for the money,I thnk this product worked great for what I paid for it. it is a little frustrating trying to remember playlists but it does work pretty good.
