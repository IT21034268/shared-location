5,Great Experience,"I had been wanting to read this book for a long time and when I finally decided to buy it it came quickly and just as described. The book was packaged well to make sure nothing happened to it, absolutely fantastic experience!"
4,WALLFLOWER,"After reading the book The Perks of being a Wallflower, I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who wants to read about the challenges of teenagers. I'd also recommend the book to someone who's had troubles with drugs and would like to read something they can relate to and also be entertained. This book is about a boy named Charlie who enters highschool with no friends after his best friend commited suicide. He ends up making two very good friends who are seniors, Sam and Patrick, and spends almost his whole freshman year hanging out with him. Charlie struggles with drugs and the task to make friends after Sam and Patrick graduate. If you like books about life's problems, this is the book to read.-SamFlorida"
3,Surprised,I read this book a long time ago and then read it again. It was not the same story. Now that I am older it seemed forced. I just did not have patience for Charlie! I know he had a bad time but still his manner frustrated me. this is a book you will enjoy if you are an idealist or young. If not it might get on your nerves. The author also does TV though and I liekd some of his TV shows!
3,Just for you Mr. Hoest,"This book was a joy to read. It is easy to follow and has many interesting details. I would say the only thing that is odd about this selection is the format it is written; which is a diary type. The one good thing about that is the fact that it keeps the book moving at a fast pace with the shorter entries. The basic theme of the book is about how high school life can be in the modern day. The author himself is a new author and i believe that his writting skills can and will develope more. But all in all it was a great book that i do recommend to anybody, especially teenagers."
4,Decent,This was a very good book but for younger readers. Fast and easy read with an ending that took me for surprise
5,Excellent Novel,"""The Perks of Being a Wallflower"" is simply an amazing book. It is written through the perspective of a ninth grade boy whom the reader soon finds to be psychologically impaired. It's not until the end that you really find out the reason why. The book is basically about growing up through high school and being yourself even if that makes you the quite one. Chbosky writes wonderfully and in good detail. He has a great imagination and I cannot wait to see how the movie turns out. This is a must read. I read it in two days. :-)"
5,Perks of Being a Book Nerd,"There is something about this book that really touches my heart. I relate to Charlie because I was a lot like him. I was the teacher's pet in English and I was confused when it came to social situations. So you could say that me and Charlie are kindred spirits.I picked up this book, not knowing what I would find. i found a wonderful, sweet, heart warming story about a kid. You love Charlie and you want him to succeed. You'll cry when Charlie is hurt, you're gasp when Charlie does something scary, you'll laugh when Charlie is just Charlie.If you are an avid reader like me, then you must add this book to your collection."
4,Great story,"I really liked this story and I can't wait to watch the movie. It is very intense, so read only if you can handle a complicated harsh story."
2,What a disappointment!,"After hearing such great things about this book I gave in and decided to have the first hand experience of finally reading it for myself only to find a great disappointed in the end. Don't get me wrong some parts were in deed interesting but I felt as if the book had no meaning to it, and if it did, it should be more clear to what that meaning is. The ending was quite confusing, the writing was just plain TERRIBLE, no words can describe, and the main character (charlie) wasn't very likable (unless your the type to like EXTREMELY sensitive crybaby's who sulk all the time) The book had some potential at first, but then slowly started going downhill. The only reason I got myself to finish reading it was because I thought it would get interesting again, but of course it didn't."
2,The Perks of Being a Wallflower,"This book was on a recommended reading list from a seventh grade English teacher.Though well written, I think it is inappropriate for the average young teen. The main character'sdiary, started after the suicide of his best friend, relates experimenting with drugs andalcohol and observing acquaintances having intercourse. The main character hassensitive issues in his life. Thankfully psychiatric treatment and close friends help himfind peace and maturity. Careful guidance is needed for a young person reading this book."
5,The perks of being a wallflower,This was the most amazing book I've ever read when i finsihed it I felt so light.
4,Entertaining Read.,"While it wouldn't qualify as my favorite book ever or anything, it was quite the page turner. I thoroughly enjoyed it."
4,Good easy read,"I bought this as my first Kindle purchase. Very interesting, easy to read, and quotable. Would recommend as a good summer read."
2,Hard to follow,"Disappointing. Drugs & low self-esteem. Kept re-reading. Written in main characters voice.No plot. Repetitive & sometimes just dumb. Do not like this "" journal"" type writing."
2,The Perks of Being a Wallflower,The book The Perks of being a Wallflower is a book in my opinion is not a good book. I did not think that it related to me at all. It was about a boy in high school that writes letters to a friend that does not exist. He does this because he has alot of things going through his mind. He has to deal with the everyday problems that a teenager has. If I were him I would talk to a doctor or something because boys are not sopose to have diary's.I don't really recommend this book bcause i did not like it.
1,A Crime against literature,"Wow. This was a trite piece of garbage. The prose is absoultley atrocious (yeah I know the author was trying to pull off the confessional letters of a young high school kid- but the character is supposed to be a smart writer.) The book explores the character's passive behavior is borderline autistic. And it's fine and great to have a male character that expresses emotion, but the kid cries every two pages. Jesus.I can't believe I actually finished this crap. It's rare that you really read a truly awful book. It is too much of a time investment to read a whole novel without being pretty sure it's going to be good. But I fell for some of the hype surrounding the book. I should have known better. MTV lowers the discourse a little further."
1,There are better books,"This book is about a teenage boy at highschool and his problems in life. The book is written in a letter format and it describes love, drugs, homosexuality, friendship, feelings and thoughs the maincharacter Charlie is confrontated with.To me the book started good full of ideas and awaking interest for Charlie's life. But unfortunately the author didn't manage to keep his novel at this niveau, the excitement got lost and the reader - me - got bored. The more pages and letters I read, the more I disliked the book and I was quite happy when I finished it, maybe because Charlie's character made the story too foreseeable. When Charlie kissed Sam although he knew he would get in trouble, it was foreseeable to the reader.The repetitions of some of Charlie's characteristics like his being honest and bad at adapting to new situations complete the image the reader gets, but they excite as ""much"" as the rest of the plot.To sum up: There are better books."
4,the perks of connections,"I read this book because my teacher thought I would make a connection with it. After reading the first diary entry, I knew I liked it, but I didn't feel connected to it yet. The story is about a boy named Charlie who is a freshmen in high school with no friends. His brother is a freshmen in college and his sister a senior in high school. I love how the book is written in diary entry form because it makes it seem more personal.The Perks of Being a Wallflower is personal, intense, and real. you get to meet Charlie, his family, and the friends he make along the way. You also get to meet his friend who passed on and his late Aunt Helen. This story never drags on and stays at a good pace.You really experience teenage life as it is today even though the book was written in 1991. It deals with deaths, crushes, relationships, pregnancies, and much more. After finishing this book, I definitely felt a connection to Charlie; it felt like we were walking in each other shoes."
3,Cool book,"It is an easy read it only took me two days but to be honest, it is not that great of a book. One of the messages is that we should live the moment but I couldnâ€˜t really see how it aplied to the main character. Over all, it is a cool book but not the best book ever."
3,A Promising But Flawed Debut,"Note: Mild spoilers below.First and foremost, I would probably give this 3.5 stars if that were possible.As for the book...I thought it was pretty well done. However, because this type of ""coming of age"" story is so relatable, I think reviews for it tend to be higher than they should be.Charlie is a likeable protagonist and there are times when the story clicks very well, but on the whole I think Chbosky's tale lacks the realism that is so important in a novel like this one. For instance, people like Sam and Patrick aren't the type to attend school dances. Another example is the sequence where Charlie visits Bill's house. It didn't feel right for Bill to praise Charlie as one of the smartest people he's ever met. Charlie never struck me as being particularly bright; quite perceptive and observant, perhaps, but not particularly smart."
2,Not Very Many Perks,"Charlie, the main character, is experiencing his first year of high school. His friend past away during the summer and he is very nervous about high school. He relieves some of this nervousness by writing letters(the format of the book) to an annonymous recipient, whose identity is never revealed. The letter writing was recommended by his English teacher, in which Charlie has an abnormal relationship with. Charlie meets two friends who are seniors. They make his first year experiences, somewhat too mature and illegal for anyone.After reading this book, I was left with an unsettling feeling. I was very surprised and disturbed by the content of this book. Some of Charlie's experiences, I feel should not have been shared. If Mr. Chobsky felt that he needed to share every experience, then I think he should have used some discretion. I think this book is a bit too crude for young adults. I would not broadcast or recommend this book for high school students."
1,Not Recommended for Anyone,"I really didn't like this book.The main character was emotionally disturbed and he was really hard to relate to. He was practically a social outcast, and this book made me cringe because he was so naive. Charlie was so immature and stupid, but the book tries to make him seem gifted.This book was just really strange, and I don't recommend it for anyone. I read half of it, and I wish there was some way I could remove it from my memory."
1,The Ends Did NOT Justify the Means,"I thought this was one of the worst books I had ever read. The author used shock tactics to try to make his points, but he ended up writing a book that tells me he has no idea what the youth of the time period were doing. He uses drugs and sex to draw an audience, but the people who are drawn to such stories will be impervious to the points Chbosky is trying to make. Furthermore one has to wander what IS the point he's trying to get across? That abuse is inheritted? Or is it a coming of age story with a severly troubled teen who can still get high, drunk, and laid with the best of them? No maybe it's a love story that was never meant to be due to the triangle of mixed emotions and sexual roles. Whatever the purpose it was missed, lost, or maybe forgotten in the rush to fill the book with the jumble of sex, drugs, and rock and roll."
5,Great read,This was a great book. I loved the characters and how they related to each other. You felt for them all and rooted for Charlie the whole book.
1,This is not for teens,"This book is not for teens and young adults. It was a gift for a 13 year old, but I had to retrieve the book."
2,Very disappointing...,"I can't believe people can relate to a 15-year-old who feels it's necessary to describe even the most mundane and common things (like swirlies), who cries every other page, and who has an unhealthy relationship with a dead Aunt. To top it off: you never know who he's writing these letters to, and if the person is as much a stranger as Charlie says he is, I hope he's been throwing them away unread. The only good character was Patrick. I really liked him and was rooting for him, not Charlie, the entire book.Save yourself the time and read Catcher in the Rye instead."
3,This was a disappointment,"I was disappointed in this book. I read it for our book club book this month. I liked the writing style...told through writing letters. I was just not that impressed. I never did make any kind of a connection with any of the characters, really and certainly not the main character. To me he was flat and way too weak. I was hoping since this has been made into a movie that it would be better. I am looking forward to our book club discussion, then maybe I'll appreciate the book more. I would not really recommend this book to any of my students."
1,Loved the book! But shipping took forever!,"The Perks of Being a Wallflower was a great book! It was short but still a great read. I bought the book for my book club and I received it when we had already moved on to are next book. I bought the book from this seller especially because of the fast shipping reviews and info on the seller. But I finally got the book almost a month after I ordered it. Overall the book was not worth it, I did not even need it since it came so late."
5,Courtesy of Teens Read Too,"Charlie. Where to start with the character that every teen can relate to? He's not a character teens should look up to, respect, or idolize, because he makes the mistakes that every teen does. He is just proof that someone else really is going through the same thing. He really becomes more of a friend then anything.This book is written as a journal, but Charlie writes like he's talking to a real person. It's definitely a different way of writing, and it really works for this book.Charlie really is a wallflower. He looks at his life like he's watching through a window that he can't get on the other side of.Charlie experiences all of the things that normal teens are exposed to, and he handles each in a different way.Read THE PERKS OF BEING A WALLFLOWER, because Charlie makes you realize that everyone is going though the same types of ordeals. Love him, hate him, root for him, and cherish him. I know I always will.Reviewed by: Taylor Rector"
3,Muddling in the Fog,"This is a very readable story, but it goes nowhere, and when it finally just ends, it is totally forgettable. I already can't remember the hero's name. Time passes, things happen, yada, yada, yada. It is like tiresome, repetitive, gray wallpaper: no flowers."
4,Wow,"I kept reading because I just knew that there was a reason for all the author was saying.... I was not disappointed, at the end, it all made sense."
5,Amazing,This book is so different than anything you'll find in the teen section. I don't know if I can put it in to words. It was special.
4,interesting combo,"Loved the style of writing that let me feel like I was reading letters from the main character. Less cumbersome than traditional writing. I was at once on the edge of my seat waiting for the bomb to drop, a little weary of the humdrum random chatter, and laughing out loud. I was anxious to find out what exactly ailed the main character. Brilliant."
4,interesting read,"This book was a good read overall, loved all the music references throughout as well. It was written in the form of letters, which I wasn't expecting but that did not take away anything from flow of the story. Pretty funny at parts and definitely a smart coming of age story."
2,DISAPPOINTING.,"Personally, I was disappointed. Based on the great reviews this book is getting on Amazon, I assumed it would have a lot to offer. I found Charlie flat and somewhat one-dimentional. Chbosky's attempts to build a character based on lists of his favouriute books and songs just don't cut it for me. Nor did the ending evoke any feelings of pathos- I found it to be a cheap trick by the writer to try and make his story moving and touching with the ending he wrote for TPOBAW. I will credit him that the letter-format added a personal touch but this was annihilated because I could not become close to a character when all the time the protagonist showed through so clearly Chbosky's attempts to build him into something deep, causing him to come across as shallow -quite the opposite.I'm sure this book does have something to offer because so many reviewers have raved about it but in my opinion this book left me empty and dissatisfied."
4,Intreresting.,"I keep reading. The shortstories are great, it is a series of letters and they are great.Recommend you try it"
5,Amazing,Very good! Going to tell everyone to read this! Might read it again myself soon! Going to see the movie now!
4,An unexpected delight,"I read this book after I received a recommendation from a colleague. I didn't have high expectations as I wasn't exactly a ""wallflower"" myself. I finished this book in about two days. It was an easy and enjoyable read. I would recommend this book to anyone looking to take a brief trip back and remember the moments and friends you shared in high school."
5,The Perks of Being a Wallflower,"I LOVED this book! Charlie, the main character, describes in detail his entire life to an unknown recipient of his letters. He deals with issues like sex, drugs, school, family, death, love, and all of the others that occur in the everyday life of teens today. While some might find parts off this book offensive, Charlie is only innocently describing the truth, and his thoughts about it. A must read!"
5,AWESOME,This book was extremely entertaining and wonderful. The only drawback is that the author hasnt written any others. Its very difficult to find a book so intriging and acurate. I want to encourage all my friends to read it.
1,The perks of being a wallflower,This book was amazing. I cried when I finished 2 hours after I bought it! I encourage everyone to read this heartfelt book. Best book ever. Such a great story and I'm going to read this again and again. I loved Charlie and him explaining his life. 5 stars!!!
3,a sad read,"I found the contence of this book to be sad. It talks about drugs and smoking and abortion as if thoes things are ok. Books reach a wide ray of people and their contence can afect peoples thinking. Its sad what young people have to deal with today,I did like the way the book was written in letter form, it felt like you were reading over someones shoudler and that is always fun to do. The ending made you sit up and think about the main character its good he had supportive parents and friends, You know he was going to be o.k"
5,The Perks of being a wallflower,"This is probably one of the greatest books I've ever read. So relatable, and makes you feel...well...infinite. a must read."
2,Suspenseful,"This book was very touching in that I learned a lot about being happy and developing friendships. I especially enjoyed the characters and how their roles were brought about; Charlie`s especially. The amount of times charlie and his friends cried made the theme especially sentimental. Although there was no evident plot to the story, the overarching meaning of the novel stands out. I did like how the reader is immediately in suspense questioning if there is indeed something wrong with Charlie. Revealing in the end how he was raped my his aunt as a child completes the book and ties everything together."
3,Perks of being a wallflower,Interesting read. Ran through a roller coaster of emotions and felt sorry for Charlie. Book was open ended and I still had some questions after I was done.
4,Interesting:),"I loved the format of writing. The story line was inspiring, motivating, and deals with every day situations. A must read!"
3,Good book,This was a good book with an interesting viewpoint. I had several friends who had read it and enjoyed it so I thought I would give it a try. I liked it but not as much as the hype.
5,Great Book,One of the best books I have ever read! I can't believe it took me so long to finally sit and read it.
2,Hated It,"I personally hated this book. I thought it was weird, written badly and too repetitive. I didn't like the style of writing either; the whole book is just letter after letter describing this poor kids life, thoughts and exeriences. The subjects made me uncomfortable making me almost find this book trashy rather than enjoyable at all. This is just my personal opinion and if you feel the same way, don't waste your money. I don't see how this book is popular at all."
5,fantastic book,"This was a great read. If you have seen the movie please know that the book is far, far better!"
3,It's a good read,"I enjoyed reading this book, I mainly read it so I could watch the movie which stars one of my favorite actors Emma Watson. While reading the book I thought maybe Charlie had some sort of autism being so honest and socially awkward but it never says but I do get it with what happened between him and his aunt. This book would be a great read for teenagers that are going through the same thing or for just understanding of what others might be going through. I also recently watched the movie and though I thought it left out a bunch of details that tie everything together, I enjoyed the mother better then the book. It gave Charlie a lot more emotion that the book did and made him not so much of a spaz."
2,Perk's Review,I thought the book was depressing and a little hard to follow towards the end. It's sad to think that some people are feeling like Charlie was.
2,Review,"Very interesting book. Entertaining but awkward and vulgar at some points. Very straight forward. However, I really enjoyed the writing style."
1,Didn't enjoy it much at all,"I bought this book because of all the hype around it. Too bad that's all there is to it. This book is very cliche, the main character isn't even realistic and seems very fake, especially with the wording, to be honest. The loners at my school are more human than the main character in this story, which makes sense because they're not fake. I think this book isn't worth your time."
1,Ick!,I couldn't read this one...I got about 10 pages in and put it down two or three times. I have finally given up and won't be reading it.
5,Insightful story of what we all think at some point.,"I really connected with Charlie's character and could not put the book down. I did watch the movie first and I couldn't get enough, so I decided to read the book (also a friend's high recommendation) and I don't regret it one bit. I want to know more about the characters' journeys."
5,Wallflower,This book is very well written and connects you with every person's feelings. I would recommend that you read this book and enjoy the beauty it certainly has.
3,It's worth reading once,It`s an OK book it makes you want to keep reading but I`m not so sure I liked the bedding.
3,Notes,"Ok book. Kinda makes you think about life, but seemed too depressing for me. The grammar was not great either."
5,Great book for any reader!,"I love the way Charlie explains life. It's not just another teen angst book, it's about finding yourself....well more like finding hope when everything looks bleak. He reminds me to find moments where I feel infinite."
4,The Perks of Being a Wallflower,I loved this book! There were so many relatable situations. The only thing I had wished for was some clue of who Charlie was writing to.. But overall I really enjoyed reading this and hope the movie is as good as the book.
4,Read it,"A good book, is one that changes you after you've read it; and this one in particular is incredible moving."
5,The best book I've ever read!!,"I loved this book, it was so emotional, and I could connect with it. I can't wait to see how different the movie is though! Love love love<3. P.S. I hate reading..."
4,Life,I would recommend this book for anyone. It was a great story about life And I hope this book makes you feel as infinite as I did.
3,Kind of a let down,Book is good...not great. Would recommend it to friends but thought it was missing a lot! Thought it would have been better after reviews!
3,Books before movies,Not what I expected but meaningful. Hard to picture Emma Watson but I think the movie might be long and drawn out
4,Good but DEPRESSING!,"I had to read this for school and let me just say, you will probably feel pretty depressed at the end of this book. The whole book has this cloud of dead always surrounding it. Another than that, it's a pretty good book. It's got alost of teen issues and sexual things in it, so I really wouldn't recommend it to anyone under the age of 14 or 15."
5,the monster breathes,"I have never cried as hard as i did when i read this book. What charlie goes through, the things he sees and the things he feels, it all paralleled my life on so many levels. I openly wept for the first time ever from a book and it felt so good. For once, an author has gotten it right. Everything inside of me was written here.Charlie goes through so much. He really changes, metamorphosises and takes everyone he touches with him. This book has a magic about it that i will always be grateful for. After i read it, i gave a copy to all my closest friends and hoped they'd understand me better for having read it. So many of them hadn't understood my emotions until they read it. The way chbosky writes it, you can feel the characters breathing. This book has changed my life."
3,A bit cliched with some redeeming points,"I honestly expected a little more from this book. I thought that there would be some sort of deep insight revealed by the end of the book, but it didn't really seem like there was. In general, I thought that the book had a nice flow, and that I was interested throughout by what Charlie had to say. Some passages of it were good but in the end, there was no big ""revelation"" that made the book.Also, the other characters seemed undeveloped. Nobody really changes except for Charlie. I guess I could relate to a few parts of the book, (as a high school senior), but the events seemed to be cliched and slightly unrealistic."
4,A cool read,"Who wasn't an insecure mess in high school? The narrator of this book may take that to another level of intensity, but the worries, thoughts, and hopes he expresses seem nearly universal. This is a story we all know (or may even feel we've lived), presented in an interesting and unique new way. I definitely recommend it."
5,A must-read masterpiece!,"With the help from OUT Magazine, I looked at the cover picture of the Golden Boys in Perks of Being a Wallflower and I told myself try to get a book to read what it is saying. I got hooked up reading the whole book in one sitting and oh boy...I got so sentimental with the characters in the book and started to understand what I had gone the pains while I was a teenager in residental school. I want to applaud Stephen Chdosky for the masterpiece in writing a novel (more likely in writing in diary proses). I recommend anyone to try it and you will enjoy it afterwards.Thanks.Kevin"
5,A must read for all teenagers,This book was a great experience and I recomend it to any teenager or adult. It is the gross reality of how painful and wonderful being a teenager can be. I fell in love with the narrator Charlie who wrote letters of his life. He is a deeply honest and good person. And his unique style of writing makes the book even more real seeming. He writes like he would talk and doesn't try and doesn't use big words that people would never say in thier everyday conversations. He is a simple boy that most people can relate to in some way.
5,Such a telling book of our generation!,"I read it some time ago, maybe a few years. It is kind of hard to get into at first, but after 20 pages you will be hooked. It is witty and well written."
5,This book changed my whole out look...,This book changed my whole out look on what people can realy go through in highschool and reading it as a freshman it opened my eyes to reality...it also helped me understand how my freinds felt when they came out of the closet to me and everybody else...lets just say i was the accepting one of the bunch. Thank you Stephen Chbosky for writting this book it realy did help me understand everything alot better.
3,Perks of Being a Wallflower,"Yes, I gave this book three stars and to some this may be a little shocking, but there's no need to be offended, this is just my opinion. I feel that this is a good past time book and its definetly not an ""oh my gosh, this is so boring book"". It's interesting in a weird, lonely kind sort of way because of how it's written. If you've already seen the movie you might be sitting there like ""Wow I can't believe it, not, I'm tired of reading this for now, but I'll definetly get back to this latter. This is certainly a good conversation book. This is a book that you'll be excited to talk with your friends about. It's not a favorite but it is worth reading and adding to your collection."
4,Great book,"A very interesting view from a teenager with a troublesome life, a great incite from the author, I recommend adding this book to your library as its different from most books I read...."
5,Sad and sweet,"This book was awesome. I started reading it and didn't put it down until I finished it. It is so sad and heartbreaking. It's about a teenage nobody who suddenly makes friends with popular kids. They begin to trust him with all their secrets because he's so quiet and ""safe"". He becomes exposed to parts of their lives they would hide from everyone else. He experiences love and loss, and discovers some secrets about himself and his family that he never knew about before. A great book about personal revalation and growth. It's a very easy read and written in a uinque style....letters to a person the main character doesn't know. All in all, a great book."
2,PERVERTED!,This was the most purturbed book I have ever read! this kid witnesses everything including a couple making love! the vivid details are absolutely revolting! I haven't finished it and hopefully it will get better but I really don't want to know what goes on in Stephen Chbosky. I would recomend this to any perverted young adults.
1,"I've read some great new YA books, but this isn't one of the","A dull and sophomoric novel with few surprises and little insight. I was glad to reach the very unsurprising conclusion. If you want a terrific, authentic novel set in high school, get Speak, Hard Love, or Rats Saw God. Perks of Being a Wallflower is dull."
1,Pure Garbage,"This book is pure garbage. The Perks of Being a Wallflower is for all of the dumb, rich, suburban kids who think the worst pain in the world is being dumped by a crush. Do not think you are intelligent if you read this book. I also am disgusted by the people who say this book is a classic, the classics are Catch-22, Brave New World, any book that send an important social message. So burn this wretched book and actually go expand your horizen of knowledge.P.S. Some people say this book is for liberals, well I'm a liberal my self (and I mean true liberal, not Democratic party liberal) and even though it writes about liberal topics, it does not mean it is going to appeal to liberals. In fact, from the people I see reading it, it seems to mostly appeal to conservatives, who know very little on the subjects."
5,The Perks of Being a Wallflower,I loved this book. It's about the struggles of a teenage boy going into high school as an outcast. It's relatable and riveting with love and tragedy that people of all ages will enjoy
2,OK,"Being a female teen, this is not my kind of book. It was an ok read, but I only read it because it was given to me as a gift. I would never have bought it on my own."
2,Pointless.....,"I didnt enjoy this book at all, it was sraight out boring. The plot was very weak and I kept waiting for something to happen, and knowing that it couldn't just end that way. ""Charlie"" is really annoying, and the author is trying to make it seem as if he is writing and sending the letters to the reader, but the whole thing really isn't working. I only gave it two stars because Sam and Patrick are cool characters, and the characters weren't all that bad, except Charlie...i dont recomend for you to read this book, I'm telling you now it's a waste of time!"
5,my favorite book,"the perks of being a wallflower has to be my all time favorite book. i dont really know what to say about it except that if you havent read it, you really need to read it. sometimes people talk about how there are books that they read that they just cant put down. i had never read a book i couldnt put down until now. this book is amazing."
3,So so,"It is not a book that I would choose to read again. However, it was a pretty good read. Amazed that it was banned in so many schools."
4,The purest of innocence,"I loved being in the mind of the said narrator ""Charlie"" . it does an amazing job of showing growth , young love, friendship, and anything else that could be going through a young boys mind - in an unconventional way. Perspective being a common theme throughout, Charlie certainly gives you many things to reflect on. id recommend it to anyone who likes a light read, but don't get me wrong its still quite engaging. I refused to put it down and before i knew it, it was over.I wish i was the person he was writing to and for him to have continued his sophomore year (maybe as a sequel). Then again its great in a way that he didn't, because that means hes well on his way to a full recovery."
2,Just okay.,"Perks of Being a Wallflower was a quick and easy read. For the most part, it was engaging. But overall, it falls into the continually emerging genre of Overrated Angst-Ridden Teenage Fiction. Honestly, not a lot of originality here. It would be nice to read a book about a well-adjusted teenager for once. They do exist."
1,FILTH AND PERVERSION,"I CANNOT BELIEVE THIS BOOK WAS REQUIRED SUMMER READING FOR MY 9TH GRADER GOING TO 10TH GRADE. THIS BOOK IS FULL OF SEXUAL CONTENT INCLUDING RAPE, SODOMY, HOMOSEXUALITY, PHYSICAL ABUSE, DRUGS, ALCOHOL, AND EVEN A REFERENCE TO BESTIALITY. THIS BOOK HAS FEMINIZED A 15 YEAR OLD BOY AND MADE HIM INTO NOTHING BUT A CRY BABY. IF YOU ARE A PARENT OF 14 YEAR OLD, PLEASE SAVE YOUR CHILD FROM READING THIS FILTH. THERE ARE PLENTY GOOD SOLID LITERATURE THAT DEALS WITH TODAY'S TEENS. SOME CLAIM THERE IS A GOOD MESSAGE IN THIS BOOK. MAY BE SO, IF YOU ARE AN EXPERIENCED ADULT AND CAN FILTER THE FILTH TO GET TO THE MESSAGE. THIS BOOK IS NOT FOR 14 YEAR OLD KIDS!!!"
5,ugh this book never gets old,I'm not usually one to reread books.... but I've read this one about 3 times and I cry every time. It's so emotional and just all around PERFECTION. favorite book forever and always.
2,A disappointment,"I bought this book hoping to find my voice, hoping for a character to relate to. I didn't find either.The prose is painfully dull. ""Caught between trying to live his life and trying to run from it ... "" the back cover reads. That phrase might as well have come directly from the text, for all the action it portrays.Show, don't tell. Is that so hard to do? It's writer's rule no. 1, and usually a manuscript won't make it out of an editor's office still in one piece if that rule is not scrictly adhered to.I have to give a little credit, though. I was surprised by the end of the book when I felt a sudden bout of sympathy during its climax. I don't know how he did it, but somehow the author made me care without actually making me care.But God, was this book a bore."
5,Great!,I love how Chbosky made Charlie write like he was writing a diary/letter to an unknown friend. It was a very interesting book and I highly recommend it.
2,The Perks of Being a Wallflower,"Very disappointed in the whole book. It was not written well, and did not meet my expectations. The story was very slow and very dismal. I am so sorry I read it. How it made the Best sellers List, I have no idea."
4,Great read,Loved it! I really liked how you sort of have to figure out what's going on for yourself. I would recommend it to anyone over 13.
4,An unexpected twist.,"I found myself really relating to the main character of this book, except for the twist at the end. It was a great book with an unusual style of writing through letters. I thoroughly enjoyed reading The Perks of Being a Wallflower. I read it in one day."
4,Good read,"This was a creatively written page turner. I enjoyed it. The 90's throwbacks (song references, etc.) are entertaining. It definitely hooked me and is true to its title. I never thought about whether or not I was a ""participant"" in ""normal"" high school life or not, but this book makes you think about social life from another angle. Fun read."
5,Great!,"I will honestly say that I had never heard of this book until the movie started to come out, but I decided to read it anyways. It was so worth it! This is a great book and great quality."
5,"Quick, but good read",I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It was a true to life depiction of the trials everyone goes through to fit in and figure out the world during one's teenage years.
4,Well...,"The book was good however I think they should have a recommendation age on it so the reader will be a little more prepared to how DETAILED some things areNever the less, a really good book"
2,How can you honestly call this book a classic?,"I decided to buy this book strictly based on the reviews that were on this site. This book is far from a classic. After I finished the book I kept asking myself, did I miss something? I am not that far removed from high school and I am a high school teacher and I did not care for this book at all. I even noticed that some reviewers compared this to Catcher in the Rye. What were these people smoking? Catcher is so well written that it could not possibly be compared to Perks. The only perk of this book is to take it for what it is worth, an attempt to rip-off Catcher and update it for the millenium."
5,My daughter was gushing about this book.,I let my kids pick any random books they want from Amazon a couple of times a month and she thoroughly enjoyed this book. So much she quickly picked another book that was listed as similar from Amazon after she finished this one. Books that encourage more reading are definite 5 stars.
5,amazing!,this is a must read! this should be on the required reading list for high school students. i think each year they could gain something new from this book with each read.
2,Do Not Understand the Attraction to This Story,"This is another book I read because my teenage daughter read it. I can't imagine what the movie was about, because not much happened in the book. It would have been more satisfying if the reader learned who the narrator was writing to throughout the book."
1,a contrived plot; read Catcher in the Rye instead,"I, too, read this book over the course of a few hours. It was a quick, simplistic and unfulfilling read. I found the plot to be contrived- it's as though Chbosky took every ""crisis"" that the evening news purports is rampant among high-schoolers, and thrust them all upon Charlie. As a current senior, I've never met anyone who has had this stereotypical high school experience. I liked Charlie, but found myself envious of him- he spends the novel reading amazing pieces of literature and I was wasting three hours on this story. I picked up this book initially because of comparisons drawn between it and Catcher in the Rye (one of my favorites), but in hindsight I realize that Holden would've called Chbosky and his novel phoney."
2,Not what I was expecting,"I was really looking forward to this book because everyone says it is amazing. I also wanted to finish it before seeing the movie. The book was alright. Nothing bad, but nothing major. It was interesting to see a boy so sensitive from a male author though."
4,The Perks Of Being A Wallflower,"""The Perks of Being A Wallflower"" is much more than a lamenting teeny-bopper diatribe against life. It is a good story about being real in the face of enemies, and about living life to the fullest. Although it wasn't the greatest book I've ever read, I recommend it to anyone with 2 hours, a sense of humor, and some un-named question stored in the back of their mind. 4 stars"
4,Good read,"I think this book would really speak to a certain kind of ""alternative"" young reader. I really liked the main character and that it was set in the early 90s which is kind of different."
4,Teenage angst and mental illness,"I enjoyed this book; it is a quick-read (I read it in two days) and a look at the life of a lovely, awkward, depression-prone teenager, starting his first year of high school. The book takes the form of numerous letters from the main character to an unnamed ""Friend"", so it reads like a diary, or sorts. Through the diary, we follow the main character through various coming-of-age events: having a crush on a girls, first kiss, experimentation with alcohol and drugs, masturbation, dealing with loneliness, and the death of a friend. The main character comes across as sensitive, perplexed, and naive, in other words, exactly the way many of us were in those crazy, teen years. I felt like I could identify with the main character, in some ways, particularly his feelings of isolation and utter confusion about the social scene around him.A quick, enjoyable read. Good for teens or adults."
5,I am in love,"This book is absolutely amazing. After reading it, I decided all of my friends have to read it, so I bought all of them a copy of it! Cannot wait for christmas so they can enjoy this book too! Everyone should read this book!!"
5,Touching,"Touching, thought provoking. Well written.A lovely read that takes an intimate look into the fragile mind of a teenage boy."
1,Meh,"Wasn't what I expected, and not in a good way. Wasn't worth my time, but alas I bought it so I read it."
3,Eh,It was okay. Rambling sentences & not long enough. Could have went into more details about the incident with his aunt.
5,A must read,Amazing a classic and a new all time favorite. Puts life into perspective and hits all the main points of teenage years.
1,Not for me,"This is not a book I will read again. In fact I'm pretty disappointed that I bought it. I really wanted to see the movie when it came out, but now I'm glad I didn't waste my money."
4,A good read,I found this to be a good read. It had a very interesting perspective! I also loved the characterisation of this book.
5,Amazing,"So many great quotes that anyone can think about when they're going through a hard time in life. You really get to know Charlie, and he really is a wallflower. This is my favorite book of all time."
4,Almost There,"Such a great book I finished it in about 5 hours! I still feel there's something missing at the end though. Like I said, it's almost there"
3,Perks of being a wallflower,"The book had a good plot, but I found it difficult to read due to the way it was written. It was written like a child wrote it, so that was different and confusing at times."
2,Not what I was expecting,"This book was okay, but definitely not what I was expecting. It has a good story line but I felt it could have a little more background before the book starts. I really like how the book is written as letters because I felt it added to the story. Everyone has an opinion and I feel you should read it and make your own."
3,"Not what I expected, in a good way!","I laughed out loud a few times, loved the characters , and found this to be a really easy read.....finished it within a 24 hour period. I wasn't expecting the ending, but loved the world of support and love that Charlie is surrounded by. Would I read this book over and over again? Not really sure, but I'm glad I read it at least once!"
2,Ehhhhhh,It had too many f bombs and inappropriate things. Other than that it want that bad of a book. Ehhhhh.
4,So amazing&#128525;,"This book was so amazing and touching! There WERE some very graphic sexual scenes, but i loved this book so much!"
4,Reminds Me of Us,This book has a unique honesty. It reminded me a lot of being young and felling infinite. If you are a child of the 80s or early 90s this will strike a deep chord within you. Worth the read.
5,Still Love It,I read this when I was a teenager. It was as amazing then as it is now. I don't feel that I need to elaborate because there are so many reviews that already say the same things that I would. Just read it.
5,"A Quick, Reminiscient, Read","All of my friends read this during high school, so finally I bought it over the summer and read it in 3 days. I couldn't put it down and in many ways reminded me of a modern day version of The Catcher in the Rye, my favorite book of all time. You will love it no matter what age you are and I highly recomend it."
4,Wow,Wow. That book was so good and really emotional too I now want to watch the movie to see if they did the book justice
5,Wallflower,"A ""coming of age"" label is what I've always heard about this book. After reading it, it's so much more. The way that Charlie expresses his thoughts and emotions about everything is so raw and honest. It allows the reader to not only experience the awkwardness of being a teen, but the depression and anxiety that comes with age. I wish I would have read this book many years ago. It's great for adults and would be amazing for teens as well."
5,Good,It's good but it can get kind of weird at some parts. But other than that it was such a good book!
3,OKAY,I would not recommend this book to any of my friends or family but I would say that it is a good book and I'm glad I read it. It is a very deep book that is hard to stop reading.
5,Lovely Book,"Beautiful book, very real and touching. Everyone can identify with some part of this story. A must read for any age."
3,A Well-Written After School Special,"Maybe I had too high of expectations given the popularity of this novel, but I thought it read like an afterschool special. Drugs and alcohol, abortion, abuse (of all kinds), mental illness, gay bullying, etc. etc. Also thought the narrator's prose was overly naive and simplistic given his age, life experiences and supposed brilliance. One really good and memorable line (""we felt infinite"") can't carry the whole story. A fast read, but nothing great."
2,blah,"the perks of being a wallflower..hmm ok i found this book to be very depressing. i agree with what Leslie from Spokane had to say about it. Is the author trying to be cyncial here? i mean Charlie has OLDER friends, he smokes, does drugs,and gets kissed.(fresh year!) nope, don't think he's a wallflower. Oh yeah, he's smart too. The end was a complete suprise because he hadn't talked about his Aunt Helen and he just went into a trance while he was with Sam? didn't understand that. I didn't get what he was in the mental hospital for. His whole family treats him like he's amnaeic or something! He also phrases things weird. He doesn't sound like he's very depressed, i don't believe it. A friend recommended this, but i will not pass this book on."
3,Interesting,Don't expect an in depth story. Just about a boy and his feelings. Easy and nice read. Probably good for teenagers.
5,Perks of being a wallflower,THIS BOOK IS SO PERFECT GOD HELP ME. FIVE STARS FOR THIS BOOK IT IS SO AMAZING JUST WOW OKAY.
3,The perks of being a wallflower,Slow but liked it.Wish that he explained more about his life.Also being a wallflower isn't being everything to everyone.
4,The Perks of Being a Wallflower,"One great book, which illustrated the hard ships of growing through the eyes of a teenager. Humorist and serious at different sections within the story. I really enjoyed how the book was written because it was more personal, written in journal form. This book will help other teens and maybe even some parents to understand their gaps a little better. I highly recommend this book to teens and parents. I thought this story was going to be boring because all it mainly talks about is the life and the struggles of different situations that one faces in growing up being different, unaccetped, drug, and understanding ones self."
3,Confusing?,Was quite good but the main character appears to be confused about certain aspects of teenage life and this makes his view long winded at times.
5,great,Wonderful book that came on time. It arrived like new and was not expensive. Everyone should read this little book.
4,Prevalent now,"Being out of college for a year or so now and just now reading this book at the suggestion of a friend. I'm both glad and sad that I waited this long to read this book. Glad because in high school I was someone who would have identified with Charlie, but now that I am older and have gone through the self discoveries that Charlie went through I can appreciate it more. I'd recommend this book to any wallflower teenage or adult who ever identified them self as a wallflower. No matter where you are in the process of life this book will help to shed a little light on your path. Whether it be before you or behind you."
4,Very cute,I couldn't put this book down. It's a great book to read on a holiday because it's nice and short.
5,Perks of being a wallflower,This book is amazing it is inspirational I love how this book took me on a emotional roller coaster I so recommend this book to all my friends
4,Amazed but wondering,"I stand speechless, in a good way. Perhaps after I read this book again I'll have more to say about it."
2,Boring,I didn't even want to finish the book I was so bored. The book never went anywhere it was just very slow!!!
2,Okay..,This book actually turned out to be kinda boring for me. Nothing huge happened and some parts didn't completely make sense.
4,good,"I'm not all the way through this one yet. It's a bit slow going. Written as a diary or letter to us, his ""friend"", it gives us the insight into a very lonely young man (teen) trying to find his place in the world. Every time i pick it up, i enjoy what i've read. It just isn't the kind of exciting novel that grabs me and draws me into it. I keep expecting something bad to happen to him. But, I'd still recommend it. Controversial - yes, if you are concerned about drugs, alcoholism, sex, depression, gay characters. But, I'm not, so for me i would recommend it to teens to read."
5,Best book ever,It's my favorite book ...since it was the last one I read :). Now time to watch the movie .
4,Addictive and heart felt,"I couldn't put the book down. The troubled teenager tells his story through anonymous letters to a ""friend"" who cannot write back. It's a story of finding yourself through experiences with friend's and family, and learning to live life instead of watching it go by. The story touches up on some serious issues, I'd recommend this book to mature readers."
4,Good read,"I really enjoyed it! Read the whole thing in a couple sittings. Easy, fun read. Would recommend to a friend."
5,The perkd,This book was amazingly easy to read and very relatable. I would recommend this to anyone who likes a well written story and characters who anyone can relate to.
4,Always enjoy it,"Good book to go back and read every now and then. It's moving but slightly redundant, emotional but a little overly dramatic. Great characters."
3,Good book,Not at all what I had expected but over all great. Definitely worth reading more than once. Great writing and definitely worth the read
4,Quick read,"This book was set up differently than I expected, but we'll written. Enjoyed it. Mental illness and family issues need to be discussed more."
5,Couldn't Put it Down!!,"This is bar none the greatest book I have ever read. The author's tone was very sincere in which a teenager, like myself, could understand very easily. I recomend this book to everyone who was, or is, a teenager and knows how it feels to grow up as one."
4,Awesome,I really liked this book. It was in teresting to see how Charlie went throught the toils and tourtures of high school. He had to deal with most of the stuff that teens deal with today. The only thing that i would change about about this book was the authors language. He used shall we say adult langue that teenagers don't use. Overall this book was AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!
4,A truthfully lonely and beautiful story.,"This is a moving and captivating story about a young child that is forced to grow up in a country as lonely as this. The main character, Charlie, surprises you with his intellect, woos you with his innocence and steals you with his tale. Coming of age, finding soulmates, losing friends, and learning to love are all of the mysteries that most never accomplish. Beautiful Charlie learns that life is more than a story, it is an excursion."
5,Marvelous.,"The Perks of Being a Wallflower is now one of my favorite books! The views of a, not-so-typical, high school boy and his experiences with love, heart brake, and new friendships really make you think. I would recommend this book for teenagers and young adults. I can't wait to see the movie!"
4,Enough.,It was a slow but good book. Relaxing and at sometimes unsettling. But I liked it. Would recommend it to others
3,Bad patents,Weird just doesn't seem right. Parents didn't know what he was doing? All there fault. But it had so good points and was and easy read
2,Not a Fan,"I wasn't a fan of this book. I felt like some of the situations that were portrayed in the book were a little bit unbelievable... and it felt like the ending was a cop-out. I know this is the latest ""IT"" book, but in my opinion, save your money!"
4,Loved it. Recommend this for teens,I thought this was a lovely book. It really seemed to apply to the life of a teenager. I have recently gone through a couple things Charlie did. I loved the style it was written in. The letters were an easy way to follow the story. I would definitely recommend it to others
1,Really bad,"If you give this book more than one star than maybe you don't know how to read.But then you have to well read to understand any of it because Mr. Chbosky refers to a million other books (The Catcher in the Rye, The Great Gatsby, etc) to explain his points for him.Lazy writing."
5,Perks of Being a Wallflower,"I loved this book. The author transports you completely into Charlie's mind and makes you look at life from a completely different standpoint, which is inspiring and eye-opening. This book is outstanding because after you are finished reading it you feel changed, and that's what a good piece of art should do."
4,Review,"Not much of a plot but verrry fun and exciting. I really like the book, it gives you a different perspective on things"
3,Great book!!! But has its problems.,Loved it but has. Couple of language/sexual problems. And talks about a lot of nude things. But otherwise great book!!!!
1,unsatisfying,I found this book to be fairly unsatisfying. While it was well written I didn't seem to leave it feeling any differently. The whole time I was waiting for a significant story . But it was just a diary stopped.
5,I didn't think I would like it.....,"I honestly did not believe that I would like this novel when I first began to read it. But after a while I found it hard to put down , it has become one of my favorite books. The style of writing is amazing as well as the attention to detail. There are many times where you will find a connection with the characters and the situations they are in and can empathize with them. Over all, this book was a pleasure to read and I highly recommend it to anyone."
4,The Perks of Being a Wallflower,Interesting coming-of-age movie. I wished it had explored the relationship with Aunt Helen more since so much seemed to hinge on it.
5,Fabulous!,"I loved this book. And its not even the kind of book I normally find myself reading. But my friend recommended it and said that everyone she ever recommended it to loved it and I can see why!Its just plain honest and open and supremely endearing! The main character is geeky but lovable and no matter who you are you will end up identifying with him by the end! Though the book is mostly about his struggles its far from depressing. You really want this kid to succeed and you really do end up seeing parts of your own successes and failures in his story. Its just a darling, precious story!"
5,"Unique story, wonderfully told","Interesting year through the first year of high school of one kid. Characters were unique and written with great depth, making it easy to feel for each one. Author has a quicky voice that flows wonderfully and reads easy.Some sexual topics and drug use, wouldn't recommend for anyone below high school."
3,"Interesting, yet still not ""great""","This book is written, as a series of letters to a person only known as ""Friend"", by a young teenager. Because Chbosky has selected this as the framework of this novel, the writing style is understandably--sometimes annoyingly--simple, and it reads, well, just how a teenage boy would talk if he was relating a story to you. Therefore, there is no prose. It's pretty accurate, from what I can remember about being a teenage boy, yet it's also somewhat predictable. I enjoyed this book enough to finish it, and there are lots of interesting parts--I think Chbosky somehow got all the important parts of a story in there by accident, but they're there.I suggest this book to those who just need a break from whatever their ""usual"" is, be it horror, classic, or subversive-whatever-books. It's different, it's quick. It's neither terrible nor great."
5,One of the best books I have read.,"This book may be very simple to read, but the lessons that it teaches about life and growing up are very sophisticated. One of my favorite books of all time."
4,Good Review,I enjoyed the book. It was short and easy to read. I was able to relate to parts of this book.
4,Younger reviewer.,"I want to start off by saying that while I am only 14, and many people would say that I did not fully grasp the meaning of this book, that I think that I completely understood it and felt like it was my own life being told through the pages. Charlie is going through things that many people have in their life. Seeing people they love dating other people. The suicide of a close friend. Not everyone has been molested, though. It is true that Charlie is not an ordinary 16 year old boy. He has dealt with many trials in his 16 years that many teenagers do not face. And he is always honest. He says what he is feeling. My favorite part was when he said he felt ""infinite"". I can understand that feeling, and that made me feel closer to Charlie. All in all, I would recommend that every teen read this book, but this book is now so close to my heart I feel jelous when I see other people reading it."
2,Pretty good in some parts..,Perks was ok in some parts but was extremely boring in a lot of parts. There was a lot of parts that i thought just were blah and blurred together.. Not a memerable book.
5,What an amazing book.,"I was told to read this book by a few friends. And I'm not one to read books. But I was given this book for graduation and finished it in less than a week. This could quite possibly be the best book I've never read. The way the author shows you Charlie's life just makes you miserable and wonderful at the same time. I wanted so badly for my life to make sense like his. To have friends like him. To have everything be so simple like him.""Charlie, you're a freak."" ""I know, but I'm trying.""I only wish I could be that strong."
1,immature,"This book was so juvenile, the characters were immature I also didn't like the way it was written. The main character is a troubled 15 year old that cries all the time, I found him very unlikable. I didn't relate at all to this book, for sure written for a very young reader."
2,Very Teenage in nature,This book was written by a middle schooler! It was very un-satisfactory and elementary in nature. The author wrote like a 6th grader. Would not recommend to anyone.
3,"great book, not great condition","Great, quick read but as far as the condition, the book wasn't in the best. But that didn't matter to me."
5,Beautiful.,"I'd been wanting to read this book for quite some time. I'd heard great things, but nothing can really do it justice.. you just have to experience it yourself.Beautifully written. Read it all in one sitting.. then proceeded to inform all of my friends that they MUST check it out. I actually had one that promptly did. :) And he loved it as well.Will no doubt be reading this again and again."
2,Meh,"The ending is strange, it just sort of stops for me it left a lot of questions unanswered. ok story line"
4,Heartwarming,"For some reason I decided to check out the audio book for a mild distraction. As a woman in her 30's, I was moved how the author did a wonderful job capturing the feelings of lonliness, anger, happiness, despair and the basic need of being love and loving others that most of us experience.In my opinion, it almost takes someone with some life experiences to really see just how fragile we can be, whether it was yesterday or almost twenty years ago."
5,Like listening to your best friend,"Reading Chbosky's words brought me closer to my old self as a teen and brought back the memories of my best friends from high school. All the highs and lows, ups and downs of feeling like you don't fit in and trying to just disappear into the ugly, faded walls of high school are all in this book. Awesome! If you like this one, you will love Kane's new novel,Confessions of a Catholic Schoolgirl"
5,The Perks Of Being A Wallflower,"Charlie is a highschool student who keeps a diary on his life. In the book he shares with us everything from new friends, first crushes, parties and much more. He will take you through what seems to be a teenagers typical life.I would recommend this book to anyone . It pulls you in and leaves you on the edge to keep reading. I would have to give this book a ranking of five out of five for Chbosky's excellent work. I was never into reading before this and the book ended up really surprising me."
5,Very beautiful,"Made me laugh, cry and remember the tough times. Instantly fell in love with Charlie. Amazing quotes. Absolutely heartbreaking. And also heartwarming."
4,Amazing....,Inspiring and perfect...this book is relatable Chbosky keeps the reader on his toes throughout ever letter Charlie writes. An amazing read.
5,Breathless!,I just finished reading this book and it is my new favorite! Charlie is a character that so many people can relate to and this book deals with issues that so many go through. And the poem in it is the most haunting thing I have ever read. Read this if you want to be entertained!
3,Good but is kinda racey,I saw the movie first so the book had more daring subjects in it esp for a freshmen in high school like Charlie is.
5,Yes.,Wonderful. Absolutely wonderful. This book is a must read. It is very engaging and an easy read. Definitely recommend it.
5,simply...infinite.,"I, myself, am a freshman in high school. (I'm nowhere as cool as Charlie, but this isn't a place for that...) I've read this book a countless number of times, and whenever I finish it, I wish it could go on for another hundred or so pages. Chbosky's fine and involving writing draws you into Charlie's turbulent world- to the point where you feel that *you* could be the one in the front seat of the truck, when that special song comes on and makes you feel infinite. The Perks of Being a Wallflower takes you through Charlie's world- from starting off mourning the loss of his best friend, to his senior friends leaving for college, and all of the sex, drugs, and Rocky Horror that finds its way in the months between. Definately one of the finest pieces of literature to find its way into the 'young adult' genre in the past 10 years or so. Bottom line: read it. You will not be disappointed."
2,Soap Opera Life!,"After reading Chbosky's Perks of Being A Wallflower, I wondered if the author had watched any soap operas. The story of Charlie, a fifteen year old freshman from Pittsburgh, offers insight on the events of his life thusfar. However, it seems as if EVERYTHING that can go wrong in someone's life does in Charlie's... molestation, suicide, date rape, physical abuse, drugs, and homosexual sex are all part of Charlie's existence. Perhaps I'm naive, but I can't imagine that anyone's life can be filled with that many obstacles (except of course your average soap opera character). Is it any wonder that Charlie ends up in a mental institution? While it's obvious that he was imitating Catcher in the Rye, Charlie's life seems almost unfathomable!"
5,unconventionally beautiful,"(...) once i started it i could not put it down and read the only thing in one night. it is unconventionally beautiful, whatever that means...."
4,Very believable,"If I didn't know this was a work of fiction, I would swear that these really were the letters of a teenage boy written to a far away friend. Chbosky has truly captured the voice of a teenager in this book and tells of all the emotions, experiences, trials and tribulations of oneyear of growing up. Charlie may be a bit over sensitive and his high school experiences may vary from those of your average American teenager, but this book shows that not all kids fit into the same mold. While the book spans one full year it seems like a small snapshot into Charlie's world and development. This is one I would not mind having a sequel to read."
5,Amazing Read!,"This book is so amazing,i dont read much but when i read this it hit so close to home in some areas i about wanted to cry but laugh because it related to me and i didnt realize how much the things that went on in my were were funny.Charlie is smart and adorable who has his problems.he has to deal with his friends suicide and then his only frined left, susan , grew up when she got to highschool and didnt want to talk to charlie , charlie is forced to make new friends while trying to ""participate"" he meets Sam and Patrick at the football game. his life is complicated and is normal in someways to a freshman in highschool. i wish this story were real, i wish i could meet charlie make him real. this book is so good for young adults who deal with depression who can think on the same level as charlies life style. 5stars all the way!"
3,"Good, not fabulous","I had heard great things about this book and wanted to read it on my Kindle before seeing the movie. Perhaps I was not the target audience. It was ok if not a little depressing. I agree with other readers that Sam's discussion with Charlie towards the end of the book was terrific and did sum up what I had been thinking as the reader. However, (SPOILER ALERT) the ending was truly disturbing and although we know Charlie has some emotional or mental illness, I was not at all prepared for the last part. I would recommend it for a book club because it might be fun to reminisce about about being a teenager, but I would not recommend it as a personal read."
5,could not put the book down!,"This was a great book. I usually take a few days to finish a book, but i read this in half a day!! Now i cant wait to see the movie."
4,Loved it,"I'm 17 and I just recently read The Perks of Being a Wallflower..and I absolutely loved it. It was recommended to me by so many people who said it was the best book. I really enjoyed it, and it was an easy to read book with some deep thoughts in there. Also it was short and addicting..i couldn't put it down. I just fell in love with it."
5,**wonderful book for all ages**,"I found this book, while looking online one day. I read the reviews and it sounded wonderful... I read the entire book in two days!This book is a wonderful ""Story"" told by a freshman in high school, Charlie. Charlie is quite timid about entering high school, and after his best friend commits suicide soon after the first days of school, Charlie is left friendless. Charlie soon meets Sam and Patrick (who are brother and sister) and they become his best friends. This is a story of Charlies freshman year in high school, his troubles with his family and his friends. This book is truley wonderful and all of my friends are in line waiting to borrow and read it. I will be a senior next year in high school and this is a fantastic book for anyone in high school or college."
5,Great read,"I rarely read adolescent fiction, but this one really got me. I think Chbosky did an remarkable job of covering all of the touchy adolescent bases without making his motivations too obvoious or cliched.Charlie, the disturbed 14 year old main character, is endearing and I appreciated how his point of view differed from ""reality"" and how the other cast of characters see things. Chbosky did a great job with the language and putting dialogue into the letters.I highly recommend this book."
5,I couldn't believe it,"This book was amazing from beginning to end and I was very sad to finish it. The great thing though is that I can read it again. Wonderfully written and captivating, you won't be able to put this book down even if you wanted to! :)"
1,Was Charley mentally-challenged or just naive and slow?,"I thought this book was ok, but not a 'must' read. The main character Charley was someone I cared about when I was reading, but forgot about as soon as I stopped reading. Am I the only reviewer who thinks Charley was mentally-challenged???? The clues are all there, folks. There are better books to read than this one was."
1,What kind of title is perks of being a wallflower?,"The title perks of being a wallflower is an interesting one, just like the book. It is about a teen who encounters new things his freshman year in highschool. He goes through sex, drugs,and abuse. This is a good book you will definitley find something that you can relate to in this book. I would consider it to teens and adults. Also it is a short read.thankyou"
1,Perks of reading a crappy book,"O.K., I bought this book because of all the stellar reviews on this website; (...) This MTV offering is Dawson's Creek in book form ... cliched and exaggerated to the Nth degree. Chbosky goes down the list of cliched characters like it's his life's mission - we have the gay boy who isn't sure he's gay, the lesbian, the jock, the confused but supposedly ""innocent"" boy and so on. There's nothing here an average high school student in America can *TRULY* relate to, I'm sorry. (...) There are MUCH better lesser-known books out there that run circles around this slush ...(...) Sorry, Charlie, but I can't recommend The Perks of Being a Wallflower."
1,What a waste of trees.,"I hated this book. It's very disturbing and makes it seem like all teenagers are sex maniacs, drug addicts, and were sexually abused as children and later suffer personality twists and weird mental collapses as a result. Don't buy it: go burn your money instead, it will put the cash to better use."
1,The Dawson's creek of literature,"This has to be one of the most cliche ridden excuses for teen-angst literature ever published, although it's popular acclaim was to be expected what with the increased ""dumbing down"" of today's creative litarary standards. Upon reading a synopsis of the book, I was hopeful in the expectation that the protagonist would have some semblance to myself during my formative years. I was treated to the ramblings of some pretentious wannabe Holden Caulfield (accurate so far), but, to reiterate what others have already said, no teenager I ever knew spoke like this. It reads like the script of a bad episode of Dawson's Creek. Have they had this on Oprah's book club yet?Please, if you think you might share something in common with this guy, why not try Mersault in Camus' far superior ""The Stranger""."
2,Very Disappointing,"I heard amazing things about this book but I must say I found it completely disappointing. I was looking forward to reading it and I will admit it had the potential of greatness or at least being semi-good but it does not live up to that potential.The main character Charlie is not all that interesting. He is actually quite boring. What saves ""perks"" from being completely unbearable to read are Charlie's friends Sam and Patrick. Honestly the book would have been better if it was narrated by one of them instead; their stories seem far more interesting than Charlie's.The biggest problem with this book is it tries too hard. Every difficult subject is mentioned (i.e. suicide, rape, abortion) but not explored by the narrator in any real way. Everything is glanced over and unrealistic.I've read worse books than this one but I still would not recommend it to anybody."
3,A Bit of a Letdown,"Before buying any book I always like to look at the reviews of people who have read the book. For this book in particular I found almost no negative reviews and expected the book to be great. When I got it I was so happy to be able to read it, but upon starting it I was letdown. I'm not saying the book doesn't have its good qualities but I just isn't the amazing book everyone says it is. They make it seem to be the next major american classic, and it is far from it. However, I can say one good thing about ""The Perks of Being a Wallflower"", it was slightly thought provoking. Not on a high level though, and the thoughts provoked within myself would not be for everyone because they aren't in the same situation. I'm not mad that I read this book because of the few thoughts, but I certainly wouldn't recommend this book to many people I know."
2,The Perks Of Not Reading This Book,"Unless you were a child prodigy who could read the Fountain Head and Naked Lunch in two to three days, play a part in the Rocky Horror Picture Show and discuss the meaning of life and death among other things at your teacher's house at the age of fourteen, then this will not be the book for you. This author is in wonderland if he expects any average person (and it doesn't even matter what click or scene you were in while in high school) to believe or relate to this story. The story at times became way too ""cute"" and kind of left the story shallow and unrealistic. Overall not a bad book and even some decent music references but if you are of a certain age and have somewhat of a grasp of reality, you probably won't buy into this book."
3,FEELING INFINTILE,"FIRST OFF, I WOULD LIKE TO SAY I ENJOYED THIS BOOK A GREAT DEAL. MY GIRLFRIEND FELL IN LOVE WITH THIS BOOK- SO IGAVE IT A SHOT (ALTHOUGH THE FACT THAT MTV IS ONR OF ITS PUBLISHERS). IT WAS CAPTIVATING, FASCINATING, ENJOYING, NOT BORING FOR A SINGLE MINUTE.I HAVE TO SAY THE TRUTH- ALTHOUGH I RECOMEND READING THIS ONE, IT HAS MANY FLAWS: IT IS WRITTEN IN A FAR TOO SIMPLISTIC MANNER, THE AUTHER DESCRIBES EXCESSIVE ABUSE OF DRUGS AND ALCOHOL AS A NORMAL WAY OF LIFE IN HIGH-SCHOOL, THE ENDING IS POINTLESS AND NOT NECESSARY, CHARLIE THE MAIN CHARACTER IS VERY ANIGMATIC AND ONE DIMENSIONAL.ALL IN ALL ITS A UNIQUE EXPERIENCE."
1,Okay,"Actually, I really liked this book and would probably give it 4 or 5 stars. However, I personally never read those reviews, and I'd like this to be read. All of you who say that Charlie is unrealistic or say that no teenager acts like him should read the last 20 pages again. There are reasons he acts differently than most teenagers, and I think you missed all of them. If you didn't miss them, then I believe you're making the worst argument in the world. Also, don't write a review before you've finished the book. What's the deal with that?"
1,"No ""Perks"" about it.","I read this in a day and it bored me to tears. It starts out with Charlie's ""best friend"" Michael's suicide, (which is supposedly one of the themes of the book) but it is barely mentioned. We never know what is wrong with Charlie, because he shows some sort of mental disability that can only be seen by the keen eye. I honestly don't see what all the fuss is about. I'm the exact same age as Charlie and I have no idea where he is coming from."
4,Listen up...,"for every person who immediatly trashed this book because of the the letters MTV....i say, fck you. you don't like it because it's not you. the thing is...it's not supposed to be, it's about a kid who is discovering everything good and bad about going through life. you shouldn't want to enjoy or not enjoy a book because it doesn't follow your perspective of life, or even who published the damned thing, you should like or dislike a book by the story it tells."
3,Book for young teens,"I remember reading this book when I was in middle school. I remember that I liked it a lot back then. However, I am now a senior in college and didn't like it as much this time around. I felt like a 14 year old girl reading this book. Was a very easy read. I recommend this book for young teens."
4,Makes You Think,"The book is a little strange through out and the main character is a little too weird, but the book makes you thunk about life. The end was touching and makes you realize what life is about.A good book for teens."
5,Honesty,"It is entirely refreshing to read a work of fiction that provokes not only thought, but relativity as well. I've never identified more with a book."
5,Perks o being a wallflower,I loved it. It's a must read no matter what age!! It really makes you think of all the things going on in your life.
2,Not what I expected.,I've heard people rave about this novel and it was simply not interesting. Perhaps it was that I found it hard to relate to the main character or that I'm used to reading SciFi and Historical Fiction. This book was definitely not something I recommend. I can't imagine the movie being any better.
1,Horrible!!,SOOOO BORING!!!!!! Seriously one of the worst books I've read...extremely disappointed. I was really thinking this was going to be a better book than what it was.
5,Loved it!,"This is a great book, selected by my book club. It is a very quick read! I just couldn't put it down!"
5,Hits Close to Home,"I first read The Perks of Being a Wallflower in my freshman year of High School. I felt all too close to Charlie and his experiences, at a time when you are yanked out of childhood and pushed into a world of confusion and change this book is a help and inspiration. Charlie's experiences went hand-in-hand with the happenings in my own life. This book is an excellent read for all people, especially teenagers who feel as if they are alone in their views and perspectives on the world."
5,I'm 28 and I loved this book...not just for teens,"I thought this was a great book. It was a quick read, but still had substance. I cared about the writer of the notes and I really wanted good things to happen to him. The reason I kept reading was simply because the writer drew me in. Excellent book for young adults or for adults, looking for a break from the heavy literature of ""adulthood."""
2,Very odd,"I was curious as to what the hype was about...so I bought the book.I am not one to read about homosexuality, rape and child molestation, so this was not for me."
2,Not so much...,There is only two reasons why I finished this book..1- I paid $10.00 for it.2- I always tell myself never to give up on a book. It could be the ending that takes your breath away. ( this was not the case)We all have our opinions about books. This one just wasn't for me.
3,Not really for me,"This book is DEFINITELY for a younger audience. I do, however, enjoy a good young-adult book and this definitely fit that category. But I think this is for VERY young adult; Like still in high school. Kind of made seem as though High school is just a ton of drama, drama, drama. It wasn't for me, so I couldn't necessarily relate to the book. I did, however, get a few laughs from it. I struggled to finish the book because it just didn't interest me."
5,An original favorite,"This book is obviously a classic for a reason. I did have a bit of trouble getting into Charlie's narrative at first. He grew on me though. His character is very real and I connected with his emotions. It was a bit of a shock finding out at the very end and things did connect. In all, I think it must have been a very different book back when it was first published. I commend Chbosky and definitely recommend others to give this classic a try."
5,The Perks Of Being A Wallflower,"The Perks of Being a Wallflower by Stephen Chbosky is by far my favorite book. This is the story of what it is like to be in high school and to grow up. Charlie the main character in this book writes his thoughts emotions and experiences in letters. This book can be described as a diary or journal. It discuses his experiences threw the topics of sex, drugs, love and the Rocky Horror Picture Show. This story was good because the boy Charlie was growing up then and I am growing up now and he was the same age when he wrote all this stuff. Also some of the stuff is similar to what i do or some of my friends do."
5,My Favorite Book,This is my favorite book and is definitely worth the read for anyone in or going into high school. I would say more but It would kill the book. Amazon shipped this book and it arrived two days early. I love amazon and will keep using there great service
3,"Like, not love. I won't remember it in two days.","This is a moving book, but it doesn't hit great depth. Although this book is honest enough, I can't help but feel as though something were missing. This is a work which is massed produced and which hits just at the boundaries of the depth we are socially allowed to feel; it doesn't go any deeper than that. It's a safe book. It's afraid to jump off the edge."
5,I loved this book.,This book was amazing and really shows the peer pressure of high school students this coming from a high school student herself. I loved this book it was amazing.
1,Perks?,Not my recommendation. I thought this one was vile. It ineffectively deals with teen subjects and indulges a teen's point of view about lying. The book deals too lightly with segregating choices.
4,"Yeah, it's a lot like ""Catcher."" So?","I, too, ran across this book by mistake. I was intrigued by the cover and the title, but hadn't heard of it before. Smiling, because I was checking out a ""Young Adult"" book, I anxiously took it home and read it in one session. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this to anyone--of any age. It's wonderful. It'll make you laugh and cry!"
5,"An accurate, enlightening, and humorous acount!","""The Perks of Being a Wallflower"" is the most realistic account of growing up I have ever read. Charlie is an observer of everything that goes on around him, but rarely observes himself and his emotional past. Charlie's life story starts to leak out of the pages, and the book will keep you interested. Please, read this book! It's worth every penny. Plain and simple."
4,Perks of Being a Wallflower,"Well written book, unexpected ending. It really makes you think about Charlie, the protagonist, and what he is going through. Good read and I would recommend this book to high schoolers. An interesting part about the book is that you don't know who he is writing to and you almost want to assume he is writing the letters to you."
4,"Very good, but I felt ripped off.","Easy read. At first I had a problem with the writing but quickly kept myself by remembering it's supposed to be written by a fourteen/fifteen year old. With that in mind I could handle it. I also noticed his skills in writing evolve and get better. The characters are extremely likeable and and I felt they were all easy to connect with as I've been in similair situations that many of them were in. My only major beef with this book was the ending as i felt Chbosky was running out of steam and couldn't think of decent way to tie loose ends up and finish the book. I felt ripped off and I felt that it's was highly unbelievable. If it wasn't for the rest of the book, I would have diregarded it, but I feel this is a book that can be re-read (minus the last couple of letters) and still keep it's charm.The mix-tape he makes is very good too and I tend to listen to it on late night drives home. If you can get a copy of it, do so."
3,Meh,I had higher expectations for this. But it may just be that I'm not a hug fan of diary style books.
5,Great coming of age book,"From the moment I started reading this book I could not put it down. I read it in 2 days. Love,love, love it"
3,"Sweet tale, 3.5 stars","This is a coming of age story centred around Charlie as he enters high school. The story is told in diary format from Charlie's perspective and works well for the premise. Charlie does not make friends easily but at the start of his freshman year he befriends two older students who draw him into their social circle. The story flows quickly and remains interesting throughout but the reader quickly becomes aware that something is amiss based on some of Charlie's strange actions or reactions. While the reason is only revealed at the end of the book, it is not difficult to determine what it is way before then. The naivety of Charlie is sometimes unbelievable but still he becomes a likeable character and someone you find yourself rooting for. Overall the story is a heart-warming, sweet tale of friendship and finding yourself."
5,Loved it!!!!!!,One of the most amazing books I have ever read!!!! It so good!! I would totally recommend this book if you love to read all kinds of books!!
5,Great,"Usually, I have trouble reading and staying focused. But, this was truly a pleasure to read. This book drew me in from the start. It's a book that is as unpredictable as it is wonderful. I saw the movie first but it just enhanced the book for me."
4,The Perks,"This book was recommended to me by a friend. I'm glad I read it because it was good, although it ended suddenly."
4,Nice read,I thought this was a really sweet book even though it was a bit confusing sometimes. I just wish I knew more about what happens to Charlie.
4,Really good!,"This type of book is so far from what I usually read, but it was very interesting and thoughtful. Defiantly a book you have to experience on your own, everyone will get something different from reading It. It makes you think about things."
4,An amazing read,"This book is one of those stories where you can't put it down and it takes you back to high school. I would even say it's at the level of Tuesday's With Morrie especially with the lessons it teaches of how everyone has problems but we all manage somehow, everyone has a story."
4,Curiosity,"This was probably one of the best books I have ever read, I just wish I knew who he was writing the letters too and what she thought."
1,Poseur teen-angst,"With RARE exceptions, at least in my opinion, teen-angst books never work when they aren't written by TRULY angst-filled YOUNG people. TPOBAW just didn't work for me at all; it just seemed too contrived and poseur-like for me, and I'm not even counting all the cliches .... a big thank you to the reviewer who recommended ""Little New York B#stard"" by Dylan Raskin - now THAT is a book written by an actual twenty-something that has more angst in it than every single one of these cookie cutter teenage lit books put together (it's also the same book that Audrey Seiler, the girl who faked her own disappearance, is claiming provoked her to pull her disappearing act) .... Go read that and forget these Music Television poseurs."
1,unrealistic story,"When I first heard of this book, with avery appealing title, I might add, I thought immediately that I should read it. After the first page I was horribly disappointed, and eventually felt as if Charlie's nauseating honestymight make me vomit. Charlie was an unrealistic character who cried, whined, and pouted at every turn of thepage. Although, on a kinder note, I did like the characters Patrick and Sam."
1,"If I could give this book less than 1 star, I would.","I saw an advertisement for this book on MTV, and it looked like a good book, so I bought it. I have never been more disappointed. The prose is trite and longwinded, the plot is almost nonexistent, and the characters are one-sided at best. It saddens me that this book has become so popular while other -- better -- high school novels are barely noticed. I'd never before regretted buying a book before this one. The most irritating thing, I think, was the self-congratulatory way that Charlie views his own writing. I felt like the author was trying to tell us he was talented, when, in reality, what he should have been doing, was showing us. The whole book was just very disappointing."
1,Totally let down,"After reading this book and expecting a huge surprise at the end I was disappointed to find out that the book was very predictable. I found myself getting very invested in the main character, Charlie, just to find out basically nothing at the end. At least it was a quick read."
5,A great book you you want forget.,The book is beautifully written. I constantly am thinking about different scenes in the book. A great first novel.
4,"Nice book, very good messages","I loved the point of view The Perks of Being a Wallflower was written in, it was awesome life long advice that was given that could help people of any age."
4,Personal Review,I thought this book was great. I think it can help people who feel lost in the world. I never would have predicted the ending either.
5,Honest and Pure,"This novel takes you through the freshman year of Charlie, an interesting and different teen. Very honest and realistic. Setting is in 1992."
3,Three stars,This book was definitely not what I was expecting. I still founding interesting but it wasn't my cup of tea.
1,Not my type of book,"This book is more for teenagers. I was not in the right mind set when I first started the book, so I wasn't even sure if it was a boy or girl talking."
4,Brilliant,Very refreshing and insightful !! Very modern day breakfast club with brilliant quotes I will not forget ! Want to read all over again
4,This is a really good book,"I like how the Arthur addressed it to the reader as if, knew who you were. This was the first book I reed on my own, I would rec amend this book to any one that wonted to read something and feel apart of what they are reading. I saw the preview of the movie and I had to find out if the book was actually better then than movie like everyone tells my. The word choice is very good it encumbers the way you think about the writer. This was a very good book. The style that it was written was very unique and outside the box that left you wanting more. I felt the ending needed more to it."
4,Being a wallflower,I thought this book was eye opening opening and inspiring . I could relate in some ways to how Charlie felt and some of what he said made me rethink my life and how I was living it. I was confused at some parts and even surprised at others. It was so worth reading and I read it in two and a half days. I think living through certain things seems a bit less scary now knowing that others have lived or even thought about the same things. This book was worth the read by far
3,Perks of being a wallflower,"Interesting characters, easy reading. Everyone has someone memorable from high school that this novel will bring to mind. Some parts were not very realistic, who gets someone stoned that is having emotional problems!"
4,Great book.,Had me reading all day and night. I wouldn't suggest this to younger kids (pre teens) though due to language and sexuality..
5,mixed tapes,"A friend of mine let me borrow this book because he loves it. I can see why! I think everyone can on some level relate to all that charlie goes through. The great thing about Charlie was that he didn't mind his ""wallflower"" status. He enjoyed the opportunity it gave him to observe everything. He was so sensitive and intuitive. Charlie seemed so much more mature than he was and it was understandable that he was hanging out with uppperclassmen. I felt so bad for Charlie at some points, particularly the end. But Charlie is so good that in the end he still loves the one who hurt him most. The dialog was enthralling. You really felt like Charlie was writing those letters to you. If someone were writing these letters to me, I would feel so honored! I would be rushing home daily to check my mailbox! My only problem with the book was that it had to end!"
3,My Summary,It was very interesting and a little more complicated than I presumed it to be. Overall I enjoyed it! Good book!
3,Good but not great,I liked this book but wasn't sad when it was over. It's a very easy read. I was just expecting a little more.
2,I could not relate to the socially challenged and unstable main character,"This is a book about high school from the view point of a socially challenged and emotionally unstable high school boy. I could not relate to his awkwardness. He was writing the letters to someone, but we never found out who. I am sure some could relate to this story and those that could probably enjoyed it more than me.At the end of the book there are discussion questions - so maybe this is the book that high school students read and discuss to talk about the challenges of high school - from that view point this book may have value.But as a 30 year old female - looking for a fun read. This was not it."
4,Life changing,"While I was reading this book, I was going through some rough times, & I must say this book made me see things clearer. I loved it, it was definitely worth reading."
2,Not what I thought it was going to be...,"Perks of Being a Wallflower is an extremely over-hyped book. Sure, it had its parts but the way people talked about it you'd think it was the Bible or something. Some parts were funny, but other parts I just didn't get. I don't think that it is an accurate portrayal of adolescence. Another thing that bothered me about this book was that sometimes the situations Charlie gets himself into are so embarrassing that you yourself feel embarrassed for him. I've also seen that the people who tend to read/like this book aren't very well read. This book is not equal to those of literary merit by any standards."
5,Touching and beautiful,"I finished reading the book and started to cry. I don't know exactly why, but that was what I needed to do. Maybe I did so because it's really easy to create a strong bond with the character, and it's always sad to say good-bye. Or it might be because it made me think about my own life and the way I'm living it. Or the reason may be as simple as the fact that I loved each single sentence of it.The book really touched my heart, and I think it would do the same with every heart of a teenager or young (and not-so-young) adult, struggling with life, with decisions. I think it's the perfect book for every little girl or guy trying to find out who they really are. And for those who probably will never find it out, too."
2,Huge Dissapointment!,I was very dissapointed. Throughout reading the book I just kept waiting for something to happen and it never did. There was never a true climax for me. I just didn't understand the point of the book.
3,Interesting to read,The author takes the reader through what goes on in the mind of an young boy and how he looks at the outside world.
4,An unknown feeling.,This book made me feel like I was v there and experiencing it all. It was truly well written and an excellent read.
5,We all have been a wallflower at some point,"Maybe we haven't been molested like several people in this book, but the author really captures the emotions I think everyone has felt at one point or another throughout high school. Truly a great read"
3,The Ending Falls Flat--3.5 stars,"This is a great book to read if you've ever been in the unfortunate position of beginning high school (or college, or a new job) where you had no friends and were a little freaked out about it. In Charlie, Stephen Chbosky has created a kind of modern Everyman in that I everyone can relate to at least one of the experiences in the book. The only problem I have is the ending--it's almost like Stephen Chbosky outlined all the plot points before he started writing, got tired of writing after 100 or so pages, and crammed the rest of the story into a final ""chapter"" (or, in the case of this book, letter).This is, for the most part, an extremely well written book--one of the truest adolescent voices I've seen in literature. It is engaging and difficult to put down. I just wish Chbosky hadn't waited until so near the end to drop so many bombshells."
3,"If you are short on cash, and time...opt for another book","Its OK...I don't regret reading it, but I wish I'd spent my time on something else"
3,NOT FOR EVERYONE,"this book had it's flaws, but it was all around entertaining. I would defiantly say that this book isn't for everyone... I personally liked the end because it bestows a sense that makes you want to understand and learn more about yourself, but parts of the books tried to be too much teenagerish. But I must say that this in no way compares to A CATCHER IN THE RYE"
2,Ehh... I could do without.,"I feel this book tries too hard to cover too much in too short a time. Unless the reader has decided to identify with Charlie before ever cracking this sleek MTV-worthy cover, he never will, for the author offers very little in the 'hero' to touch someone who has not lived a similar life. Charlie's no Holden, no Alice in Wonderland, no Harry Potter. Each of those character experiences things I never have, but in some way touches me. So, as a recent high school graduate, I didn't find that this novel spoke to me or my compulsory teen angst. That said, I did find that I wanted to read it until the end. But I wouldn't do it again."
2,cliche lite,"This book was glowingly recommended by 2 friends (adult males). I'm still not sure why. Highly derivative and cliche ridden, the broad and fully expected stereotypes cruising through this year of high school were a complete bore. No surprise, no complexity, not believable that an uber-genius would write this way. Were I still in high school (or better yet, jr. high) it would be an enjoyable read. For those of us closer to Charlie's chronological age, it's probably just pleasant nostalgia for gen x ex-nerds. Skip the book and listen to the Smiths."
5,Inspirational,"You know around 3/4 of the way through the book, I was like... so when is anything going to happen. So if u find yourself in a doldrum push through! Seeing... wow I forgot his- Charlie! Seeing Charlie develop mentally into a fantastic person Is amazing. Fantastic book!"
3,Interesting,"Good story,easy read. A lot of unanswered questions at the end. What was wrong with him anyway - autistic? Recommend it ."
5,So good,I can't put into words how much I loved this book. This book made me have so many emotions. At times I will be crying for no reason then I'll be laughing then I'll be wanting to scream at the book. I highly recommend this book for anyone over the age of about 12 because of some of the content.
5,Woa!,This book throws in some shockers and overall makes you see things in a different perspective . Loved it .
5,Perks of being a wallflower,"This book was very moving, I didn't get bored one time. I absolutely loved it and you would love it too."
4,Makes you think,"This book is amazing. It's definitely a life changing book. It makes you think about not only the main character's problems, but you're own as well."
4,Very good,It was an interesting book that I couldn't put down after I first picked it up. I recommend for teens.
5,Teenage,This book is great for teenagers. It shows the real perspective of a freshman in high school. I think everyone would enjoy this.
5,You can't explain the feeling into words,"This book makes you wonder about everything you knew before. It stunned me and the end left me speechless. The whole book caries you through all the hard experiances and decisions of a troubled boy named charlie. He makes good, bad, and strange decisions. And, you get so into the book that you feel like you know the characters and you react to their words and actions. This book meant a lot to me and I can't explain it any other way"
4,Cool story,"It is a good book. A modern ""Catcher in the Rye"" written in a ""The Color Purple"" format. I felt it could have been a better book if written in third person. Have not seen the movie yetDewayneg"
4,Good!,Not what I was expecting but it was still a great quick read. started off a little slow but worth finishing.
5,"Wonderfully written, leaves you speachless","My friend lent me this book to read after she told me she loved it. I'm so glad I made her give it to me!! This book was written wonderfully, very different from most other books I have read. The letter form and the anonymous place and names made it easy just to focus on the details of the story. I think Charlie's emotions were very honestly displayed and his letters reveal intimate details that Chbosky made very real! At the end of this book I had nothing to say. I cried. And realized it was probably the best book I've ever read!"
4,Heartwarming,I would recommend this book to almost anyone. Whether you are a teenager looking for something relatable or a middle aged man or woman wanting to look back on your own youth.
3,Disappointing Ending But Still A Decent Read,"While I write this, Wallflower had been #1 on the G/L chart for months and has received >400 reviews. I figured it must have something going for it, so I got a copy. I think this story accurately captures a very awkward time in a dysfunctional 15 year old's life--but why all the crying? The 'infinite' scene was indeed the best one as has been noted. And while I was wondering why Charlie seemed so ineffectual while he was experiencing all these things, I was disappointed with the ending only because it was completely unexpected and perhaps a bit off the wall. Regardless, I would say this is a good read and would read the next novel by this author."
5,A New Favorite,"This poignant novel hits the nail right on the head. You'll find yourself wanting to eat up Chbosky's book as soon as you dive into it. I, for one, finished it in an afternoon. It is an awesome book that anyone can read and relate to."
5,My perception of the Perks,"It was amazing, it made you think, almost too much, but not... You know, it's like whenever your teacher gives you a hard assignment and you think so much, you begin to get a headache and you can really feel your brain working, and it feels good, but painful; a good hurt. And this book was like a riddle. I felt like there were so many things to get out of it. The name dropping was great, I'm glad he put titles and authors in there. I found myself getting the books he read and looking up the songs he listened to and it unlocked these great feelings. Charlie was right. Asleep by the Smiths is truly an amazing song. ;) The format was good, the story was heart breaking while being phenomenal and I honestly think this is one of the best books I've ever read. Although, maybe that's because it's the last book I've read. :-)"
3,Passes the time,"Not the worst book I've ever read. It passes the time...but not something I'd tell my friends was a ""must read""."
5,My New Favorite Book,"I just finished reading this book, it is amazing. Very well written. It really made me get into Charlie's life and think about my school."
5,Amazing,"This is definitely one of my most favorite books of all times. After reading it, it changed my perspective on everything. Truly an amazing book."
2,Ok,"I kept reading and hoped the book would get better. I am from Pittsburgh so I loved the parts about the tunnel and city view. However, i found the book to be unrealistic for the most part without a strong plot. I finished the book and was definitely disappointed."
4,Review,"This book had the right amount of laughter, sadness, anger and mystery. It has some surprising turns all through this magnificent book. It is pretty sad, for all of the readers that only like annoyingly positive literature."
5,Amazing,It's was so good. Kinda creepy and sad but it was so heart touching. Like everyone can relate to Charlie one way or another. Through his thoughts or actions. but a very well told story
5,Amazing!,"This book is now my favorite book in the world. It is a moving story about a teenage boy. I strongly recommend this book for any teenager. We all go through things in life, and this book shows many different problems one might come to face. The book just makes you see the world from a whole new perspective. It lets the reader appreciate the small things in life. Highly recommended for teenagers. Great book, and anyone could enjoy reading. It truly is a moving story.."
4,Emotional roller-coaster,"This was a quick read for me. Kept my attention and I couldn't put it down. There are some heavy topics in the book (sex, drugs, abuse) but the author does a good job of giving it a ""slice of life"" feel. I downloaded this book on my kindle after seeing the commercials for the movie (love Emma Watson!). I have recommended this book to others - however, if you are like me and take on the emotions of the characters when you read, prepare to feel depressed/lonely when reading it."
5,amazing,"mr chbosky, sir, you did an amazing job at writing this story. anyone interested in this book should read it as it will soon become a classic. i loved this book!!!!"
5,Must read,This book is amazing! There is so many plot twists and it keeps you on your feet. I read this in less than two days because it was so great
4,Can't wait to see the movie!!!!,"This book is so interesting I love the underlined message behind the book, you can do whatever you want with your life, and it doesn't matter where you come from....our how bad it is you can always make your life the way you want it to be........... Pretty good book too keeps you guessing"
3,A book to reread,Okay I'm giving this book three stars because I loved the main character and all the feelings I felt in it. Personally I thought the writing was a little choppy. I felt that the reason why the writing wasn't like a high schooler' s writing because he was learning about the world. But I also thought there might be a better way of writing it too such as maybe more descriptive and maybe describe your feelings a little better. Other than that I loved the new meaning to the word wallflower and the story of this boy. I will admit the ending kind of changed my whole view of the book so I had to read it again. A book that is truly a different experience.
5,Lovely,"So happy to have read this charming, real coming of age novel! Loved all the characters so much. Can't wait to check out the film!"
4,Excellent,This book is now my favorite. I would recommend it to readers of all ages who are able to read between the lines.
4,Who should read this:,I like the style that Perks of Being a Wallflower was written in. It was easy to follow and easy to enjoy.
3,The perk of being a wall flower,It was a great book. I loved reading the book. The book was very well written and so was the movie.
4,Perks,A from the heart account of a boy coming of age- very Holden Caufield. Can't wait to see the movie!
4,Once was good..twice was better.,"I saw the movie for this book was released and I knew nothing of the story so I decided to read the book first since it got great reviews. I found myself thinking throughout the book about the main character Charlie ""Why is the kid crying all the time!"" But then when you get to fully understand his character you come to understand why he is so emotional and it all falls into place. It's a good story about friendships and the hardships of being in high school, I would definitely recommend this read. Without giving anything away I found that I had to read the last few chapters over once more after I finished the book because Iwas a little more than perplexed and wanted to make sure that what I thought was happening really did take place!"
2,struck me as pretty phony,"Much, I'm sure, to the author's pleasure, this book has gotten a lot of attention as it has made the ""Top 5"" most frequently censored books in school libraries, or whatever. This is because, unlike most teen novels, the book deals with themes of masturbation, homosexuality, and drug abuse.Sadly, I don't see what all the fuss is about. This never actually struck me as the honest voice of a teenager (it's written in first-person epistolary style). The whole thing sounded more like an adult trying to sound like a teenager, if you get what I mean. In other words, it seemed like the book was filled with concerns and confusions that adults believe teenagers to be having, rather than being informed by an actual teenage worldview."
2,When does the good part start?,"When I picked this book up, I expected a book to identify with. However, as I read the story, this was not the case. A majority of the book is talking about what kind of music Charlie likes, what kind of drugs he takes, or how much fun he has at the Rocky Horror show. I can't count how many times he goes to it and watches the same thing. As I wasn't interested in any of this topics the book didn't particularly give me any message.There was one interesting twist in this book. The background information to the twist makes it believable, and the way it is revealed is brilliant. Aside from that, theres not much good to say about this book."
4,Great Quick Read!,I bought this book for my teenage son and decided to read it as well. I loved it and would recommend this to anyone looking for a quick easy read.
2,not the best,I think this book is quite overrated. i wasnt a fan and i would not recommended it as a good read.
1,Comments,Awful musings of a mentally demented young person/ I have nothing good to say about it. Good by again tonight makes the necessary words
2,Not the Book for Me,I was not a fan of this book. The layout (letters) made it really hard to follow the storyline. I was confused almost the whole time that I read it.
3,It's okay,"I chose to pick 3 stars because it was for a younger crowd, maybe I'm to old for a book based on a freshman. It was okay, it kept me interested for the most part but it was kind of repetitive when it came down to describing the main characters feelings."
3,Catcher and The Rye cheap,"They made this into a movie?So it's told in journal entry form and about a whiny high school kid who feels guilty for the death of his aunt which apparently has made him social awkward. He makes some friends and parties, cries a lot and gets into Rocky Horror. That's it."
1,Why I can;t recommend The Perks of Being a Wallflower,"I could not get interested enough in the disfunctional characters to finish the book. I read for entertainment, I have no interest in doing Social Work."
5,Very good read,"A great insight on a young boy's life and the situations he runs into. His love for Sam is so touching, would've like to see it go somewhere more. But overall. A great book to read."
5,Inspiring,I liked how it was written in letter form. It was Charlie's point of view and his opinions on the different situations and the unexpected turns in the book made it all the more emotional. I was impressed in the author's ability to express the difficulties of teenagers in high school and the world. It was also nice how this novel showed what a difference it makes to have a support group to tell you that you are worth it and special. Great book definitely recommend this book.
3,Didn't meet my expectations...,"""The Perks of Being a Wallflower"" by Stephen Chbosky failed to meet my expectations. It's somewhat whiney, sophomoric, and long winded, although I guess that is to be expected when the narrative is portrayed as being written by an unstable and troubled boy. Certainly, the confusion and constant recriminations are one of the many stages of puberty coupled with the hormone storm every boy goes through. I thought after reading several reviews that there would be many more humurous YA events and situations than there actually were. I didn't dislike the story but I enjoyed ""Carter Finally Gets It,"" and ""Spanking Shakespeare"" much more...3 stars!"
5,This is a great Book,"In a modern day novel that relates back to the story the Catcher and the Rye, The Perks of Being a Wallflower is a wonderfully depicted novel about teen years. A child who is becoming a man. The boy in the story learns about the harsh realities of growing up out of the lime light of popularity and into a darkness of drugs. With sex, drugs and classic drama Charlie's diary entries give you an overview of what it is like to not know who you are. In a search for his identity, Charlie runs into love and hate and cannot escape the shadow of his peers. When Charlie finally understands his long time hidden hardships he understands his identity. This story is amazing and I have yet to read a book in its genre that matches its magnitude and prominence."
5,All the stars,This is the best book I've read in a long time. I was Charlie's age during the time the story takes place and Perks transported me back. It was a great reminder of what life as a kid is like and the struggles we all must face. This book also forced me to make a new Smiths playlist on my iPod. I'm old (40) and Perks made me proud to have experienced my teen years to the fullest.
2,A mix of wonder years and Lucas w a weird twist,Book was tough to follow because was supposed to be written by a 9th grader. It wasn't a bad book just really not one of my favorites.
5,None,"I first saw this book at Wal-Mart, and I start reading it right then and there. Only 10 pages in, I was hooked. Charlie's innocent outlook on everything he writes about in his letters makes you think. This book left me feeling different, and only the best books [in my opinion] can do such a thing. Bravo, Stephen Chbosky. Bravo."
5,My rating,I chose this rating because i thought the book was really great and that alot of people may be able to relate
2,Jacklyn,"This book is not like any other.It shows the ""real life problems"" that everyone has. It shows great every family has their own problem, their own ups and downs, their own fights, an their own make ups. This book would be good for someone who is trying to get over a very tough situation or just needs another perspective on life itself."
5,Opens your eyes,"I loved how this book made me feel. How I connected to the characters. Though it had a few typos, probably the kindle 's formatting, I plan to read it again and again"
4,Incredibly touching and thoughtful.,I chose to consider this book a four star because this book is incredibly thoughtful and beautiful. The characters make you feel as much as they do. Charlie's wish for happiness towards himself and others is beautifully written. The emotions that this book conveys makes you remember the innocent and vulnerable person that you once were when youth was the only importance.
5,A Wonderful Book for Young Adults & All Who Have Survived High School,"As someone who relates to these characters on multiple levels, I found this book very inspiring. If you have been misunderstood and felt alone and traumatized you will love this book. Ultimately it is a story of survival. How friends can pick you up,, dust you off and set you on your feet. It is a profound look at the realities of high school life. It will leave you: in tears, laughing, empathizing, concerned and many other emotions."
5,Awesome book,It was an amazing book!!!!!! I would totally read it a second Tim if I had the chance!!!!! Can't wait to see the movie now!!!
5,The most incredible story,This was the best book i have read in a very long time. Charlie's letters are absolutely beautiful. The book is an honest and intriguing look through the eyes of a high schooler with real highs and lows. This is the first book that has made me cry in a long time. It is a must-read for everyone. ~lindsay
5,~a must read...loved it~,this book was great...plain and simple...and teens who don't like it need to turn off the WB...later!
4,All things have been tried before!!!!!,"This book is the most compelling and realistc book of the many hundreds that I have read, in my short lifetime. Yes, the format of the book may be boring and yes, the story has been repeated a countless number if times, but for anyone to have read this book and not at least give it four stars is completly ludicrous. I must tell you that I am only the mere high school age of fourteen years old but I am of extreme maturity, and it is very rare that I give a review such as this but I am and I did, and for all those who say other wise who have read the book, JUST READ IT AGAIN!!!!!!"
5,Interesting and extemely thoughtfull,"I am not an emotional person, but this book brought back so many emotions from my childhood I had to put the book down many times to take an ""emotional break"".It is a very truthful book and hit home with me! I have never heard of Chabosky, but the young mand does have a very bright future as an author!"
5,Great book,I thought that this was a great book. I disagree when people say that teens are'nt like that because they are. I can relate to many things that have happened in this book and I know many other people that can. This book brought up sex but showed it in a real way and how things really happen. Not how people want them to. Teenagers now are having sex so many people can relate to this. People may not like this book cause they don't really want to face what's really happening with teenagers. One of my favirot parts of the book was the poem.
5,Absolutely amazing. My new favorite book.,"This book was absolutely amazing. It really got me thinking about life and how sad and happy it can be at the same time. It also helped me remember how valuable family and friends are to me. I would recommend this book to any high schooler. I think it helps people realize that even though life is hard, it always gets better."
4,Pretty good,"I liked the many life lessons the author included in this story and how it was so easy to relate to the main character Charlie. I really felt like I was living Charlie's life instead of just reading about it. I wish it wasn't so fragmented, however, because I found that it made it more difficult to read. This is the kind of book that needs to be read at least twice to fully appreciate it's depth and meaning."
4,Speechless...,This book is an experience. Perfect for any and all age groups. It is extremely honest and doesn't try to be anything else but a fantastic read. I wish I had read this book while I was in high school for it provides insight into other people's behavior and comfort in knowing everyone has their own battles. Perfect!
5,Read this after seeing the film,"I thought this was a great movie and a great book. Very easy to read. Interesting to get the different perspectives of the story-telling, because the book is written in letters. The movie starts this way but unfolds more like a narrative."
4,Engaging and thought provoking,"A book which resonates as it embodies the angst of becoming an adult. Having said that, it is rather sad. Well worth reading."
3,Strange but ok,The book was very different from anything I have ever read but it wasn't a waste of time. It was just average.
2,Fresh story,The book reminds the reader about the years of high school and is very easy to read although a bit repetitive with some suggestions i.e. books and songs.
5,Loved it.,Everyone needs to read this book. It's really inspirational. And really relatable. I couldn't even put it down. Read it in two days! Get this now!
4,Underground Classic,"This book was extremely different than any other book I have ever read. It is told from a fascinating perspective, only through letters written by Charlie to an unknown reciever. While slightly unconventional, the reader can definitely relate to Charlie at times. Very easy to read!"
3,The Perks of Being a Wallflower,"I found this book rather humorous and interesting, however, I would not say that it's a favorite. I would recommend it to any teenager, mainly because it deals with a high school freshmen and the twists and turns of a teenagers life. It's written in a strange format that you basically have to get used to. In the beginning, I couldn't find myself interested all that much. The guys grammar was absolutely horrible, but it was that way for a reason. After a while it does get better, along with the book! I did enjoy the book, but I often felt confused."
4,Recommended for young teens/college students,Definitely recommend! It's a quick read and I like the style of the author. It seems like a good book for this generation.
5,very good!,i loved this book! I would recommend it to everyone. I wish we would have gotten more in the ending though. :(
4,It was okay,I think in the end the person he was talking to should have wrote one letter back to conclude the stoyry
5,Best Book I've Ever Read,This isn't like the kind of books I read. But it's the best I've read. I really like the way Charlie's character develops throughout the book.
3,Inside the head of a teenager,"The format of this story brings a whole new meaning to the idea of character analysis. What regularly would be a typical deception of the life a high school student ended up being a total plot twister. All the events that occurred in the story somehow ended up having a twist in them. That is what makes this story so interesting. One moment, you think something is going to happen but just the opposite occurs. This adds to the ever growing plot of the story. Charlie's point of view on things is always interesting."
3,Kids Sure Are Different that when I was one!,It was interesting to see how some teenagers think and react to things in their lives. I would recommend this to high school readers.
4,Enjoyed it!,"Reminded me of a mix between The Catcher in the Rye and Curious Incident in the Life of a Dog. I would've liked it more if there wasn't an Epilogue that explains everything and attempts to tie everything up in a neat little package. I guess I just liked the ending without the Epilogue because it felt forced. However, I enjoyed the last scene of the book (in the tunnel). A quick and enjoyable read. Charlie is a well-developed character."
1,DISAPPOINTED,"I do not write reviews for books that often but this book hardly counts as a masterpiece and it needs to be said.First of all, Charlie is not a wallflower. He seems like he is mentally retarded but he is not a wallflower. He sees things but he doesn't understand anything which makes him come off as mentally retarded. He has no problems with making friends and going to parties.Sam and Patrick are one-dimensional characters and actually, every single character in this book is one-dimensional.My main problem is that this kid goes from being a loner to being the center of attention and a druggie in the short time of a year and there are no problems. There are no internal struggles or anything. It doesn't seem realistic and it doesn't make sense.Don't waste your money. I honestly wish I could unbuy it but I can't."
4,The Perks of Hearing a Wallflower,"This is a touching, sad and happy story of an unusually perceptive boy's freshman year in high school. Through Charlie's letters to his friend, we read about his relationships with friends, family, books, and teachers, and learn some of their stories, too. You empathize with and root for Charlie throughout, but it's definitely not sap or saccharine, and that keeps it real.As much as this novel brings back memories of some painful times, it also gave me hope that my kids might experience it differently.Eric Cazenove is a wonderful narrator for this work. His performance of Charlie hits just the right notes; I'm very glad I heard this book through his voice."
5,Inspiring,"For those who do not see how inspiring this book is, may have some problems. Of course everyone is entitled to their own opinion, and i completely respect all opinions. Some may not like this book because it features gay people. Look past that or look into that. They are normal people like us. The fact that the book has a gay relationship in it shows how down to earth and awesome the author is. This book truly lays out high school life years ago. I don't know about you, but this book truly opened my eyes. When I saw the movie trailer a few months ago, I looked online to see if there was a book and sure enough there was. I recommend more people do that, reading a book will really change your perspective on tthings. Obviously an A+ smiley face star."
3,A bit of a letdown ...,"Having attended high school with the author, I am well-aware of his considerable literary talent. At the same time, having attended high school with the author, I know that he does not truly have a handle on what it's like being a wallflower. His protagonist is easily accepted by a prominent clique, and that's not easy. The title does not reflect what the book is about and misleads readers into thinking the book is about not fitting in."
3,It's okay,"This was an easy read. It sometimes left me wondering what was really wrong with this kid lol. He seemed to have some kind of mental disorder but the book never went into full detail about that. I didn't realize how short the book was until after I bought it. I downloaded it on my iPad before a trip to NYC and I read it going and coming back home from NYC and finished it. It was that short. Overall, it was okay. It wasn't a book that I would rant and rave about though."
3,Sweet little YA book.,"Recent interviews with the author in light of the movie launch made me (a decidedly not YA) read the book. It's a first-person story, told through letters to someone whose identity is not revealed. The narrator is a likeable nerd with more genuine issues than most nerds. As befits a book allegedly written by a smart teenager, it's spotty. The fatigue and constant social worries of high school are well documented, and those are ratcheted up intensely by Difference -- being gay, or sexually available, or being viewed a strident. Though I enjoyed it, I never felt really close to the characters though. They are all held at some distance, maybe so the narrator can examine them more closely. Not all of their actions are consistent with what you might expect (though, teenagers man, that can happen), and I never really felt like all these characters lived. In short, it's a little like reading the script to a John Hughes' movie. Much to recommend it, but not exactly a great work of art."
5,Truly Captures Reality,"First of all, I must say that I am not much of a reader. It takes a lot to impress me when it comes to literature. I bought this book because it was in the top 25, and it was the best decision Iâ€˜ve made to this day. Everyone knows these characters because they are the people we love and the people we love to dislike. Sam and Patrick are your closest friends from high school, Bill is your favorite teacher, and Susan is the girl who makes the biggest physical transformation between middle school and high school. Whether we acknowledge it or not, this is our high school experience. All of our thoughts and true actions are recorded in Charlieâ€˜s letters. I would, however, hesitate to allow children or younger teenagers read this book due to occasional swearing, drug reference, and sexual content. Overall, this book captured my deepest thoughts and struggles and gave new perspective on them."
4,Very good read,"I loved how quirky this book; such a pleasure to read. It wasn't ""awesome"" like the best book ever, but I would definitely recommend to pick it up!"
5,The Perks of Being a Wallflower,"Far and away, this is one of the best books I have read. Chbosky's choice of narrator Charlie's letters to an unknown ""friend"" to tell his story is unique. Charlie tells only what he wants the friend (reader) to know, and for the narrow-minded, that just may be too much. The book screams for discussion. I recommend it for mature young adults, as well as for adults, with open minds and warm hearts."
2,disappointed,"My 14yo daughter, an avid reader of at least 4 books per month, was underwhelmed with this book. She loves to read books before seeing the movies based on them and this is the first time she has expressed this measure of disinterest. She read the book in less than 2 afternoons/evenings, waiting for the story to strenthen... It never happened. Now she says she doesn't even care to see the movie. Wow..."
2,?,"This book was reccomended to me by several friends, so I decided to read it. It is a relatively brief book, and I finished it quickly. It left me unsatisfied after all of the hype surrounding it. It attempts to be deep, and meaningful, it even tries to portray the life of a 'real' teenager. Let's face it, Charlie is not 'real'. Neither are the remaining characters, such as his friends, teachers, and family. I really do not understand the great love for this book by so many. Come on, it's published by MTV!"
2,"Ok, not great.","I don't understand what all of the fuss is about. I thought this book was boring. It was an easy and quick read so I finished it. Otherwise, I would not have. I guess I was expecting more based on the hype and the reviews. I realize I am not the majority here and I don't really have anything negative to say about the book besides it just wasn't that great. Decide for yourself."
2,boring,Not much to say about this book. It was boring to me. Can't believe they bothered to make a movie out of this story. Hope it's better than the written word. But I won't know unless someone tells me because I have no intention of going to see it.
2,"A painful, boring read.","This book takes a really bad look at child abuse and Asperger's. The main character is meant to be a genius, and yet his writing style is completely infantile, to the point of being annoying. This is one of those books where it comes across that the author does not understand his subject well enough, instead you get the Wikipedia version of autism.I was livid that I had to pay such a high price on Kindle for such an epically boring book. I think the only reason this has been made into a movie is that the name is incredibly cool.If you are planning on reading this book because you think it's about being an outsider in high school, then don't bother, that's not this book. And please, do not get me started on the premise, the entire book is anonymous letters mailed to a stranger. So lame."
5,The perks of being a wallflower,"I have read several books about high school kids,but i have never read one that goes into more detail about life. The Perks of being a Wallflower provides a different perspective on life, love, and friends. All throughout the book i questioned my life and the friends i have surrounded myself with. By the end of the book i ""felt infinite"" because of the amazing things that Charlie has said about life. This is an amazing book for all ages, this is definitely a must read."
4,"Wallflower is quiet, unusual coming-of-age read.","Love the format of the novel as the way of telling the story. Letters to a stranger convey a ""dear diary"" mood but also echoes the real-world isolation of the author on every page."
5,Great Book!,I read this book back in 2003. This book should be issued to every teenager who does not fit in a crowd or that feels left behind. I can't tell you how many times that I would pick up this book when my life got rough or I was feeling down and read it cover to cover. It's an amazing story with the music background that is in this book. The characters in book were easy to understand and made the book what it became. I absolutely LOVE this book.
5,A true masterpeice.,"Reading this book was one of the best experiences I have ever had. Stephen Chobosky truly created a masterpeice when he wrote the perks of being a wallflower. As I read the book I felt like I was Charlie, I felt all that he felt and I identified perfectly with him. I believe that this a book worthy of anyones time."
4,The Perks Of Being A Wallflower,"I read ""The perks to being a wallflower"" I thought it was a very good book, I enjoyed it very much. I think it had alot of good points. It was a very ""real"" book showing what life is like for a lot of teenagers. It talks aboout all kinds things from death, suicide to girlfriends and sex. I think it also helped alot of kids realize that they'er not the only ones who feel like charlie (the main charcater)did. It is a very good book for a wide range of different people I would recomend it to anyone."
3,"Ok read, a bit over rated if you are an adult","I know the book is a Y.A. Read but I usually enjoy the nostalgia that comes along with a coming of age novel, that is what I expected to find in The Perks of being a Wallflower. The voice of Charlie seemed unusally young, like that of maybe a 11 year old. His perception of things around him seemed slightly off to me. Maybe it's the circumstances that suround Charlies emotional trama, or the fact that I'm 26. Either way the book to me was kinda uneventful and slow. My reaction is just ""meh""."
1,Unimpressive shock value - no substance,"I really looked forward to reading what I understood to be a quirky romantic story of a high school misfit. I found the main character detached and aloof. The author managed to throw in date rape, domestic violence, drug use (to include a character being tricked into using), hetero and homosexual sex, oral sex, abortion, and incest. It was quirky alright--a complete waste of time."
1,Overrated,"This book is completly overrated especially now with the movie coming out. The person (from USA today) who said this book was ""in the tradition of Catcher and the rye and A Separate Peace"" couldn't have been more wrong. This book is very stereotypical and is like every young adult book I've ever read."
3,good movie,This was a great movie. Havent had time to read the book yet but It looks like it was followed very good by the movie.
2,Disappointed,"Read about 25% of this book, went to return for a refund and was unable to. I paid $10 for this so I am not amused.The writing style was interesting and I thought this might be a great book, but a few chapters in the story started to drag. I could not seem to care for the characters, and the subject matter and language became too rated R for my taste. I should have read more of the negative reviews before making this purchase.For those who would want to know, in the first quarter of the book you deal with swearing, teen partying, and a gay teen relationship. Further research shows there is a lot more to come if you read further."
3,"A good book, but nothing like the movie.",If you have watched the movie and is now looking into the book then be prepared that its a good book but it's nothing like the movie. I prefer the movie rather than the book.
3,Movie was better,"I watched the movie first, and absolutely fell in love with Charlie's character. I figured I should read the book since its always said that the book is better. Unfortunately that's not the case with this book. I felt so much more from each character in the movie. While I was reading the book I realized I wouldn't have enjoyed it much at all had I not saw the movie. I recommend watching the movie."
5,the perks of being a wallflower,"Honestly, I promised myself I would not read this book. For the simple reason that all my cynical teenage friends told me this book was ""raw"". Meaning edgey, sarcastic, darker....you get the point. So i assumed it was just another average teen fiction book. And lately I have been looking for more than just that in my readings. But after hearing so much about it for almost 2 years I decided to give it a try. I guess the fact that I couldn't put the book down and have read it 3 times since I've purchased it would tell you that I had a very poor judgement of it. Absolutely amazing. Enough said."
4,Great read for struggling teens.,"This is a great book about coming of age. Sort of reflective and similar to A Catcher in the Rye. It is an easy read so don't expect to be challenged by way of vocabulary. It is told through the eyes of a teenage boy, so the language can be explicit."
3,Good book but it had some flaws,While I found the book enjoyable and honest I also found many parts to be confusing and hard to follow. I would not let that deter you from the book that also was honest and enduring.
5,Changed,When I finished this book I sat in my bed just amazed. I didn't know what to think other than woah. This book made me feel like a completely different person once I finished it. I would absolutely recommend this book to anyone.
2,IT WAS NOT AWESOME!,"I don't understand how all of these people think that this book is so awesome. It was an okay book and it offered an interesting perspective. I liked to see the world through the eyes of another, even if it was a fictional character BUT it was not that great. I thought it was nasty and I didn't relate to much of it."
4,Enjoyed,Great book definitely worth reading. I would recommend this book to anyone. It's a quick read and an enjoyable book for all
5,Emotional and intensely real...,"The Perks of Being a Wallflower is an amazing book.. Stephen Chbosky really captured the way that us ""wallflowers"" really view things, how many of us truly feel but can't/wont let anyone know. Being a senior in high school, I can easily relate to many of the problems that go on in the story, suicide, relationships, drugs, depression, confusion, sex appeal, all if it is just so real. The way the book is written makes it all the more personal, a letter to someone who doesn't even know, just letting it all out, every feeling, every incident, everything. This book is very emotional and it doesn't take long until your deep into the characters and their lives. I think that anyone who feels insecure, sad and happy all at once, or just needs a story that is just intensely real.. The Perks of Being a Wallflower is the book to read."
1,Worst. Novel. Ever.,"If you're the type of person who breaks into tears at a Dashboard Confessional concert you might dig this novel -- which is basically two-hundred tortuous pages of whining by some annoying, unfunny, overemotional, pretentious kid who thinks he's a lot smarter than he is. Everyone else steer clear of this cliche-ridden garbage."
1,"Over exaggerations, pure garbage, and no perks","I had to read this book as required summer reading. It is the WORST book I have ever had to read. The details of some topics were very graphic and inappropriate. The main character Charlie is a 15 year old boy just entering high school. In just a couple of months he's already faced with a plethora of troubles and problems. I know that there are definitely many problems faced throughout high school but his are ridiculous. He faces just about every big problem possible including death/suicide, homosexuality, prenuptial sex, drugs, smoking, etc. His response to every problem is crying hysterically. My ""favorite"" part about the book is that the book never reveals any perks, the only thing we find out is that being a wallflower is a bad thing."
3,Not Age Appropriate,I don't think teenagers should be encouraged to read this. Experimenting with drugs. Gay lifestyles. Underage sex. Dealing with death badly. Giving in to peer pressure. Basically everything you don't want a teenager to get confused about. This book is a sympathic view to teenagers making bad decisions and acting badly.But it's well written and interesting. So I give it 3 stars. It has a certain realism that many adults could relate to. It steers into directions that would never happen in real life too. Like older teenagers accepting younger teenagers into their cliches. That almost never happens. Teenagers tend to be very status conscious at this age. And boys don't cry. He would be hounded relentessly for displaying these weaknesses. Reality is much more poignant for teenagers.
3,It was all right...,"Maybe I am not the right person to review this book. I read it on a recommendation from my friend, who told me it was very good. From the first page forward, I found it extremely depressing. Maybe I was too harsh on Charley, the main character, but I thought he should suck it up and move on instead of crying and pouting about everything.The bottom line: if you liked Catcher in the Rye, you'll like this book. Personally, I hate high school drama and overly depressed teenagers who have everything in life and still whine about it. Sorry, but this is how I view Charley. Others can decide for themselves."
1,Depth for the Harry Potter generation.,"One would be hard pressed to fault MTV for publishing this, as such a move was a stroke of genius, without a doubt. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for the book itself. Trying to push back the modern onslaught of empty, sentimentalist pap disguised as hardy intellectualism would be like trying to clobber some sense into a fundamentalist intent on blaming natural disasters on widespread homosexuality, so I won't try. Suffice to say, the cornerstone of this book is more of the innocence lost with age stuff, so if you're into that as a (the only) central theme, by all means, proceed. If you want some content and some real insight as opposed to a collage of bloated daytime TV ""observations"", check out David Foster Wallace, Don Delillo, or Mark Danielewski instead. If you're a teenager unable to relate to anything beyond your incredibly narrow range of cultural cliches, at least pick up Like the Red Panda and ignore this. Save a tree."
1,Horrible!,This book stinks!!! They go into graphic detail of everything!!! The author just goes on an on about subjects that should not be in Young adult books
4,A rather good book...,"I dont know what it was, but there was something that was just really weird about this whole book. There was something about Charlie I just didn't like. The way he cried so easily, the way he always wanted his life ot be perfect...I don't know. There are some really great parts, and the book really is awesome, but...it just doesnt deserve five stars.I do agree though, this should be required reading in high school. My system has summer reading, this should be one of the books."
3,So so,"I'm a 21 year old who loves reading so naturally I became very interested on this book since everyone was talking about it. I'm not going to lie, the ""On that moment I swear we were infinite"" phrase really appealed to me.It's a very thin and easy to read book. The language used (and the whole story) is meant to be understood by teenagers who might feel identified with the topics, but for more avid readers I would definitely suggest something else."
5,Loved it,"I really enjoyed reading it (again) it is very deep and has a lot of messages, with out being to cheesy. It is one of the few books that I have read (along with ""Paper Towns"" by John Green) that I think inspires those who read it to go out, write a novel and really do something amazing with your life."
2,Deep Read,"This is definitely not a book you want to read to feel good, but it is a good read and definitely keeps the reader engaged. It is a deep concept and takes some time to absorb."
4,Simply Wonderful,"I just finished reading The Perks of Being a Wallflower after 2 days of my nose in the book - it's that engaging. What a beautiful first novel. ""Charlie"" made me laugh, cry, and relate to everything he was going through. Very easy to read and difficult to put down once begun. The stories he tells through his letters are heartwrenching, comical, adroit, touching, sad, and hopeful, with a simple yet overwhelming gratefulness for life, love, friends and family. I highly recommend this book to junior high and high schoolers, especially, and to English teachers for that age group as a book to read and discuss in class. Charlie is such a beautiful, sensitive soul, I wish I knew him as a friend. Ultimately uplifting, read this book and feel infinite."
5,A sense of truth.,"I checked out this book today at the library, and finished it today. It really impacted me, being a teen, i can truely emphasize with charlie, and the things he has to go through. The book is sad, and depressing at times, but it truely does depict the life of a teen who has been through alot."
5,My Favorite Book of All Time,A deeply personal book. One of the best ever written on being a teenager. Highly recommended!
4,Good,"It was good! Slow at parts but interesting throughout whole book. Also, how things were put into perspective was interesting. Loved it!"
4,Good Book,It's was a very good book. I love Charlie as a character and the ending mad the book even better.
4,Good book,"I have not seen the movie, I just read the book. Story about the angst of growing up. Well written but some of the story line is disturbing but all in all a good book."
4,Saw movie first,"Background:I'm in college and my college has a movie theater in it. They promoted this movie heavily and I saw a few previews on tv. I'm not gonna lie I watched it because I am an emma watson fan, but I LOVED the movie. I didn't even know it was a book until my roommate pointed it out to me, so I made it a priority to read the book.Actual book review:As with any movie and book combo, there are some differences. There are actually a FEW big differences, but overall the book is still really good. A lot of people have criticized the book because of the character's voice as the fact that he is thrown into too many heavy situations, but even still it is a great book. The voice is distinctive, but believable. The situations are a bit much and are presented one after another, but this is fiction. It is entertaining and hilarious (really I caught myself laughing out loud a few times).Bottom line:I HIGHLY recommend it"
2,Over rated,I felt the language wasn't up to par. I felt like I was reading from the thoughts of the dog from the Disney movie UP.
2,Not a particular good read for all ages,The author didn't address a serious subject of a disturbed adolescent with a very realisticstory . The end of the book was weak.
2,Read it anyway,"I don't like this book. It's character development, and though written well with strong characters, prevalent lessons, and memorable quotes, I didn't like this. I own it anyway, but I find most CD books not to my liking anyways. I suppose I just need a great plot. Either way, it's rare I find a book not worth reading, even if i don't like it, so go read this. It's not supremely uplifting, and I can't compare it to the movie yet, but it's really not my thing. Too ordinary yet extraordinary."
1,awful book,honestly this book was not memorable AT ALL. had to force myself to get through it. would not recommend it at ALL. and the writing style was dull and dry. Awful.
2,perks of being a wallflower,"I would recommend this book to middle school or freshman high school English classes. It is easy reading, at 22 mildly boring but relative to someone in that age group."
5,The most comforting book I've ever read...,"You ever feel like picking up a book and reading only a few pages here and there just to regain the feeling that you had when you read the book for the first time? That's exactly what has happened with this book. It has become comfort food for me. When I feel a little down or lost I pick it up a and read just a few pages...it's amazing what happens.The novel is addictive, enchanting, heart-wrenching, and beautiful all at the same time. It is one of the best books I have ever read, and will probably stay in my top ten for the rest of my life.I read this book because it was a gift from a friend. Since then, I've passed the book around to all my friends, and they read it. I write each of their names on the inside back cover. The list is growing rapidly. I'm going to run out of room for names.Please buy this book. You will be so happy you did. It has truly impacted my life. Amazing when that happens.Love, Seth"
4,WOW!! What a roller coaster ride through High School life.,"Man when I read this book, I bought copies for all my friends. Everyone loves it. It is the heartwarming and emotional story of a young boy who doesn't really ""fit"" in one real group, so he finds some friends and just lives his life. This book will make you laugh, cry, and flat out fall in love. You have to have it!"
4,Letters that form a story,"This book was a really easy, enjoyable, quick read. The main protagonist (Charlie) is suffering major mental issues which were not helped by his substance abuse. The author really allows you to get inside Charlies twisted mind which demonstrates his talents as an author. If you have read & enjoyed the book by Mark Haddon ""The Curious Incident About The Dog..."" then you should enjoy this book.Recommended."
4,Hits close to home,"Chbosky's novel is a true-to-life account of life as an ""outsider."" The haunting reality with which he depicts the day-to-day life of Charlie clearly shows Chbosky's ability to empathize with the stereotypical wallflower. Not without its own little twist ""Wallflower"" does not dissapoint in the least. A novel, easily read in one sitting, that can also make you want to drop the book and look the other way is an accomplishment to be proud of."
4,Awesome.,"'The Perks of Being a Wallflower', the debut novel from author Stephen Chbosky, is the story of one fifteen-year-old named Charlie. Through a series of letters that he writes to an unknown 'friend', the reader gains an insight into his slightly chaotic teenage life.'Perks' is written with beautiful, simple prose, and it's full of emotion. Sure, it's full of cliches (the confused gay guy, the jock brother, the genius sister, the goths and punks of society), but I feel that Chbosky has put this book together in a way that makes all those stereotypes seem real and fresh. He's managed to get inside the head of a really disturbed teenager and view the world through Charlie's eyes.I can understand that this book isn't for everyone, but to a lot of disenchanted people, I think it means something. You may not be able to relate completely with Charlie, but you might be able to understand little bits of his life."
5,"Very moving,couldn't stop laughing and crying",Best book I've read so far please make a sequel. I don't there enough tears in the world and voice boxes for me.
5,Great read!,"The book was great. You're pulled in through a feeling of sympathy and compassion for the narrator, and as you read on that feeling turns to joy. Every chapter leaves you wanting more. When it's finally over I felt myself wanting more, to know what would happen next, but that's what is so great. It leaves it up to your own interpretation. The Perks of Being a Wallflower is an amazing book, a must read in my opinion, but don't be surprised when you finish if you are left with a feeling of wanting more."
2,Underwhelming based on the previous reviews,"Upon reading this book, my opinion is that the author is trying to glorify the stereotype of a ""wallflower"". The character is sensitive and introverted but in the book, those qualities are met with understanding and acceptance which to me seems unrealistic. It has been my experience that inviduals who exhibit these qualities in real life tend to be lonely or exist on the outskirts of their respective social circles due to the fact that sadly, very few people realize the depth that such individuals possess.In my opinion, the book reads like the fantasy of one such person in which everyone recognizes that the main character is intelligent and special and the things he says profound. I suppose in that respect, the book lives up to its title. However, as with most fantasies, the narrative of the story has a very limited perspective and the characters and events are too one-dimensional to be believable."
3,"At times funny, at others ridiculous","Very hilarious writing, very hilarious plot, my only complaint is that it was rather too hollow. I mean, yup the morals were kind of messed up, and this book follows a boy who's just too unusual to understand. Any hoot, a fine introduction by MTV (the only reason why I read this book and how I ever heard of it)."
5,Enlightening and Poignant Book,"This book really stirs up emotions of what it's like to be a teenager. It is poignant, yet funny without being overly obnoxious about it. I'd reccommend it to anyone."
3,The story has interesting points,I watched at first the movie before I needed to read it in class. The story has interesting points if you like dramas.
3,Sort of Strange..,An easy read. A sad book with a slightly strange setting. Might have enjoyed it more as an early teen.
3,HMM..,I was excited to read this book... it was interesting.. I enjoyed it but I want to watch the movie for a better understanding.
5,Meaningful Story,This book really spoke to me. I had a really difficult teenage life and sometimes Charlie expressed things I could never find the words for. It meant a lot to me.
5,OMG,"THIS WAS SUCH A GOOD BOOK! I had heard the great reviews, but never bought it. When it finally went on sale I decided to give it a try. I'm so glad I did! I read this book all today, laughing, tearing up, and relating to it. I would recommend it to all of my friends. You so won't regret this buy!"
4,Couldn't put it down,Enjoyed it quick read. One of the first books completed on my kindle. Couldn't put it down hope you enjoy it as well
2,The perks of being a wallflower,"This was a very interesting book. Charlie vaguely reminded me of Holden Caulfield from the catcher in the rye. Charlie by far was the strangest character I had ever come across. He cried all the time. There a lot of unanswered questions. Why did he cry all the time? What was he being institutionalized for? Why did he have no friends his own age? Did his aunt Helen molest him? Why would he wake up naked at random places and not remember how he got there? Did he suffer from autism, or schizophrenia? This book left too much up for interpretation for my taste."
4,A book for all ages,"I read this book as a 17 year old female in high school. I feel that my 14 year old brother and 45 year old mother could also read it and enjoy it just as much as I did. A boy's journey into highschool, friends, drugs and sex are layed out before you wondering whether he is making the right desicion for his life, and if he is not, wanting to yell and scream at the main character, Charlie, for not following the right path. I think that everyone, male and female, should read it and learn a lesson from this 16 year old outcast child. I would not recommend it to children under the age of 14-15 because the contents are mature and they might not understand the point of the message. Girls and boys in highschool should read it so they can understand what others might go through, and mothers and fathers so they can understand what their child goes through during their 4 years of high school and beyond."
5,The Perks of Being a Wallflower Review,"It was a well rounded novel that really kept me interested. I gave this book 5 stars because it was unlike any other book I've read being that it was written in letters. I also loved that the character of Charlie was vulnerable...it made believe in the story. Gtest, easy read."
5,Constantly Enthralled,"This is a definite must read! It's an easy, quick read that keeps you fully engaged and always wanting more."
5,Out of This World Good.,I personally found the book to be relatable in many aspects and was unable to put it down! It's by far the best book that I have ever read!
5,Amazing!,This book is amazing and so emotional. It really hits you...nothing is ever stated right out...it makes you really think!
3,No,Judgment gmail mg gmailNo gmail do find gmail lies to find cm gmail Skype s an an gmail8@vzwpix. Dc
4,The perks,This book was awe inspiring in many ways. I thought that it was awesome how the author's writing got better as the character became a better author.
4,Wow,I absolutely loved this book. It really made me think about life and stuff. Just wow....in a really good way.
4,Awesome book.,I love this book. Such a great story. Hope I get to read it again someday maybe in the next few months.
3,A Bit Far Fetched,"This book seems to be more a novel written for people remembering their high school years through the haze of time, than for kids living and dealing with high school in real time. Everyone would like to look back at high school and think they had amazing taste in music, film and literature. Everyone would like to look back and see that though they weren't overly popular they had a strong group of friends who cared for them, so being a wallflower didn't matter that much in the end.This book is obviously written by someone well removed from the actualities highschool, but none the less it is haunting and touching."
4,Worth the time and the money...,Beautiful book. Nice refresher of the younger years using a different angle. I thought it was hillarious at times and extremely moving as well. Glad I was able to add this book to the memorable collection of books I will cherish forever.
4,Good book!,Fast read with a great story. Reminded me of being in high school in the 90s. I'm looking forward to seeing the film adaptation.
5,Amazing,This was an amazing book. I finished it in 2 days. It gave me a different perspective on life and I recommend this book to everyone 16 or older. It had a lot of meaning to it and I couldn't put the book down because it was so good. Can't wait too see the movie!
4,High school favorite,This was one of my favorites in high school. It was so great to revisit it now again. Worth the read!
3,Pretty good!,I really enjoyed this book for the most part. I thought it was going to go a little more interesting but I'm glad I finally get to watch the movie! I would recommend this book.
2,Just alright,The book did not grasp my attention as much as I had hoped for. All in all not my type of book but it was okay
4,book review,I thought the book the perks of being a wallflower was a really good book. It spoke of many things that teenagers can relate to. This kid felt like an outsider and had trouble dealing with things of his past and things that were happening in the present. This book shows how it feels to be and outcast these feelings are unknown to some people and by reading this book I think that people will see the people that are outsiders in their community in a different light.
4,I liked it!!,Its a great coming of age story-had story lines I could relate to!! Being in high school is difficult for everyone in some aspects this book makes u realize ur not the only one that went through rough times.
2,Not my cup of tea,I ordered this because it is popular with the young crowd and I wanted to see first hand what the attraction was. I found it rather graphic and mature and cannot suggest it to younger teenagers.
4,Okay Then,The book was not what I expected it to be but it was still very well written. Perks of Being a Wallflower is one to remember.
4,The perks,"I really like the way is written, it's easy and it takes you to really deep feelings without being korky. love it"
3,Mixed emotions.,Good book but didn't like all the drug and sex references..it wasn't as tasteful and relate able as I thought it'd be!
4,Growing up,"Felt sorry for the character and could understand all his problems. Never want to go back to High School and do it all over again, That''s for sure!!"
3,Average joe,"I just wish the book was little more straightforward, so I could understand it better. I never would have guessed what aunt Helen did to Charlie."
5,Best book I've ever read.,"I'm usually not one to read books. As a matter of fact, I usually spend about a month or two reading a simple 200 page book. But this book I just could not put down. I literally read this in less than 24 hours.Logan Lerman is my most favorite person. When I found out about this movie, I was really looking forward to watching it. later found out about this book and I knew that I just had to have it. Now that I've read this, watching the movie will be that much more exciting. This book inspired me with some life lessons and some pretty good common sense. I highly recommend this book to anyone of any age."
3,A.D.O.R.-Shock Frequency...,"When i first picked up this album i focused on all the dope producers lined up on this album, the album got Pete Rock on two cuts, Diamond D on two cuts aswell as a cut produced by Clark Kent.Now sometimes known producers tends to give less known emcees wack beats to rhyme over but that is not the case on this album.All the producers does an excellent job on this album all the way through, if you lookin for some ill mindblowing lyrics this is not the album to cop, if you want some dope beats to bump tho this is what you want.In my opinion these producers should've kept the beats for some better emcees to shine on but it's still a nice album...enjoy"
1,It last only six months,"After six months of very light use, one of the speakers died. It took forever to contact Samson and when they finally accepted the equipment was defective they just never send the replacement.The guy on the store told me that with this model Samson actually did a good job (compared with all the rest of their substandard products) but at the end this proves that Samson is just a bad and lousy company that can't make it good.Be wise and stay away from anything Samson."
2,Multiple memory faults,After 6 months of use I started receiving memory faults and had to constantly reformat the module. HCL did not take responsibility nor would they honor the 1 year warranty.
1,Extremely unreliable,"I spend a lot of time away from a desktop computer, and I spend a lot of time working with Palm software that is somewhat unstable. This means that I periodically end up needing to do a hard reset and then restore everything to my palm.Well, I figured this module would allow me to keep a backup with me at all times, and even give me a little extra room in case I finally outgrew my Visor's internal memory. Not so. After every hard reset, the module typically has to be formatted. I have no idea what causes this, but it's completely useless to me in that case, and the company was not able to help me with the problem at all, aside from recommending that the module be reformatted.If all you need is extra room, but you don't need a backup, this is probably a good module, but I'm rating it exceptionally low because of this rather stupid problem with the product."
5,Who would have thought,"I would not have entertained the idea of Chinese herb for my hair, but I had my mind changed quickly. It is everything mentioned in their marketing and more. I have grown hair everywhere, ie facial, legs, arms and of course a much thicker and fast growing head of hair. The hair growth is easy to deal with happily and I will take Shen Min until or if it stops working. In the meantime, earlier hairtrims."
4,Hoping it will work!,"I have started these vitamins, and I am hoping they will improve my hair, skin, and nails. So far, I have only seen results with longer nails."
4,Good product,Does not necessarily make your hair grow but definitely will make it stronger. Expect to see results once you stop checking..3-6 months.
3,"needless to say, few to tell","well, gotta be honest, never heard this album, the only thing i know is that mike patton sings or produces oral noise on one track, which makes this album worth to sink the shovel in."
2,"Super cute, but not functional","Adorable shoes indeed! Contrary to the look of them, because they are wedges, you would think that the heel would be higher. The heel was so low that everytime I took a step, the shoe fell off. I love wedges and prefer them over flats, but the company needs to improve the comfort of their line. I have gotten lucky with this brand a couple of times, but most of the time, they are super cute shoes without any comfort. I had to return these, but wish I didn't have to because they are one of the cutest pairs I have ever seen."
4,Missing that extra sparkle to make it a true gem,"Sure, the play on words was lame...but it's the lack of information on tracking down those last few gems on the Spyro levels that keep this guide from a perfect score. The maps and screenshots though, are plentiful and very useful if you need help nabbing elusive dragonflies and finding other objectives. Boss and enemy strategies are all there too. Just don't grab this one as a last ditch effort to find those last few gems you're missing, because you just won't find that coveted info here."
4,Good circle bit,"I used this to bored, drill a hole into my wall so I could run a 4 inch duct thur it. It worked great. If you are drilling very far you may have to clean it out after about 3 inches. It is a good quality bit."
3,good for metal siding,"It is a good quality bi-metal hole saw and it cuts quickly through metal siding, even corrugated metal. It dulls very fast if used on MDF or Hardi board and other fiber cement siding. It needs a powerful 1/2"" drill with anything other than metal and forget about using it with a cordless drill.For wood and Hardi board siding and sill plates I use TCT hole cutters and my DeWalt triple speed range 18v cordless can drill a 4-1/8"" hole with ease. Best I have found are the Blue Boar which cut fast and hold up well. New version of Mega TCT can even be used when there are nails which is terrific.Bi-metal hole saws are a good bargain and good for metal and there is no point in paying any more for a ones painted a different color if all you are cutting is metal."
5,I've been looking everywhere ...,for this bag holder! I love that this can get moved around (and has come with us to 3 different houses)! I am buying one as a gift for someone and am so glad to have found it!
2,I wish I had gotten a solid plastic one,"I got tired of having my plastic bags everywhere and I am tight on space, so I wanted something I could hang on my pantry door next to the rack of spices to store the bags. This product does that, but not well.First, since it has only one point to secure it at the top, it flops around when I open the door and when I go to put bags in it or remove them. It bulges in random places, so its not attractive looking and the fabric has snagged several times on other hooks on the door. It does hold the bags though, so I gave it 2 stars for that.I think I'm going to replace this with a hard sided plastic one next time."
1,GREED AS HELL TO RIP YOU OFF! STATE:COMIC not as a BOOK,"The broken cross (The crusaders)this was a comic book and headlined as a book making it seem like a larger version of the comic and sold for $97.00. I had the comic book already and purchased it for less than $3.00. This is about as greedy as one can get in false advertising since other books selling on Amazon actually stated it as comic book but the one for $97.00 proclaimed it as a book. I did receive a refund but this is just pure greed, no matter how one looks at it."
2,A bit disappointing!!!,"I was a huge fan of the S n'T shows while I was in college. With much anticipation, I awaited the arrival of this DVD. After watching it, I immidiately put it up for auction on EBAY. I would not recommend. I have heard that vols. 1 and 2 are pretty cool. I think vols. 1 and 2 are the clips that they showed in the theatres while on tour in the early 90's."
4,"1 ..., 2 and 3 were good, haven't seen the rest","The title says it all... This, along with part 3 was pretty damn funny. 1 ..., don't waste your money... but 2 and 3 are worth it. Haven't seen 4-6 or the DVD's so I couldn't tell ya how they compare. As somebody else already said, you have to sort through some stupid ones, but there are enough funnies to keep ya laughing.... FF through Furniture Phillangies... the worste cartoon of em all....."
3,"Penises, anyone?","This disk started out very promisingly, and yes, it does have *some* funny & entertaining material. But after the first handful of skits, it becomes clear that the vast majority of these cartoons depend upon the viewer's shock and/or delight at seeing an animated penis, or animated sex acts. And I suppose the argument could be made that the title of the disk makes no promises to the contrary. It does get old pretty fast, and the lack of enough genuine creativity -- i.e. ideas that do not involve a penis -- brings the re-playability of this disk way down. I watched a friend's copy, and after the first few cartoons i was ready to buy the disk. But by the end, i was tired of it."
2,sick...and not funny,"it is as said, sick, and in general I get the sense of high school crap, instead of true black humor..."
2,Sick indeed,"Generally I enjoy all kinds of animation, hardly there is a piece that I wouldn't want to see. So I bought this disc and I've been waiting for delivery with great anticipation.. I was embarrassed in the end, that's a pity. It's not the sickness that made me sad, but sickness without any idea or a single emotion, sickness solely for the sake of sickness.Still I think that this disc is worthy just for 2-3 titles that are great nevertheless. If you're a fan and just can't get enough of moving pictures, get it; after all it's not a mainstream and is different. On the second thought, such kind of ""off-stream"" exists thanks to the mainstream animation, it is provoked by domination of sweetness and family values on screen. But such an art doesn't have any value on its own and that made up my poor 2-star rating."
4,Interesting experiment in living more simply,"Colin and Michelle take on a year-long experiment in living more simply in Manhattan, where such a feat does not come easily. They use bikes instead of cars and also get rid of cosmetics, coffee, tissue paper, and the fridge in an effort to use less and generate less trash.They show how hard it is to get used to such a life, how much has to be adapted to, and how they become better parents once the TV is gone from the home.I still do not know what they used in place of t.p., nor do I see much point in living without electricity as long as you don't blast your a.c. or use incandescent bulbs. Also, not every city is set up for bicycling, and there is no way I would lug grocery bags and a toddler in my arms up a flight of stairs just to avoid using the elevator.Interesting documentary."
3,Only impact on me was depression,"I don't think they could have found two less charismatic people to follow around for a year. This movie depressed me about recycling, I was hoping to learn new ways to lessen my impact on the environment but other then the pot and sand idea I didn't learn much"
1,Why?,"If this is supposed to be about environmental friendliness, why is it in such a huge paper package? Recycled or not, that's still a big waste of paper."
5,Eye-opening. Extreme. Effective.,"Eye-opening. Extreme. Effective.I kept seeing this DVD at Target actually, and the cover would draw me each time. The author, Colin Beavan, admits in the beginning that he wanted to humbly attempt to be an activist writer who somehow makes the world a better place. Yes, the project is very extreme, and it may not be practical if you are not in walking/biking distance from work/school/church, BUT Beavan explores ALL angles of environmental impact. I even admired how he just wanted to he and his family to be more givers than consumers of the community. :)Enjoyed it..."
3,Closed Captions?,I would put 5 Stars if include Closed Captions. But kids love it and learned a lot. If this company update add closed captions i will buy all dvds no doubt about it.
2,Disappointed,This video is annoying and music and math goes too fast to really learn the math tables. Probably ok for review but not a good teaching video. Very disappointed.
5,TRULY OUTSTANDING!,"First of all, this cd is nothing less than perfect. This is a must have for any pop/dance music fan. The songs are so upbeat and uplifting. This cd has been is my cd player for a while now....i never get tired of hearing it! It is difficult to pick a favorite song off of this album because each one moves/uplifts me in someway. I actually love every track! I wish Da Buzz was more recognized here in the U.S.A. They also have a new cd coming out May 26 entitled ""More Than Alive"" (date was given on their website) I can't wait to buy it as well! Their brand new single ""Alive"" is amazing!! Be sure to check that cd out as well! This cd is worth every cent. A bit pricey since it is an import, but well worth the purchase! BUY THIS RIGHT NOW!"
2,A bit rough,"I am 49 years old and was looking for a more gentle product for cleansing. I have sent an e-mail to Jean D'Aveze explaining that I was a huge fan of a gentle cleaning product they had in the 1990's called Soins Regenerscents Creme Nettoyonte Douce Gentle Cream Cleanser (water soluble) and I was hoping against hope this product was similar. This cleansed and left your skin relaxed and calm not rosy!I just find Gentle Facial Gel a bit rough, though as cleaners go it is a good product compare to cheaper ones.I have Roscea and while I use the Douceur De Teint Stop Au Rougeurs to reduce this high colouring I think the Gentle facial gel with plant extracts takes away from the good work the Douceur De Teint has done!"
4,Great recipes,"This is a great cookbook for healthy, low fat, delicious pasta, beans and rice-based meals. The book gives an overview of the food groups and also presents lessons in smart eating at the beginning. The book includes recipes sections of appetizers, salads, entrees, side dishes, plus a nutrition reference and metric chart. My favorite recipes from this book include: Mediterranean Pasta Salad, Roasted Vegetable Pizza, Hot Black Bean Dip, Lemon Broccoli Pasta, and Turkey Vegetable Chili Mac. Most recipes call for many ingredients but nothing extremely weird or tough to find outside of your local grocery."
5,The Short Time,Definitely one of the best albums out there. I will buy anything this band puts out. Steve Amend is second to none on the acoustic guitar!
3,"Clearly States ""From The Inside""","This book was given to me by Raymond Buckland many years ago in one of the prior editions. The book's title seems quite clear that it has been written from the writer's view of his own experience over the years. I found it an interesting life experience to read about and also useful as a reference guide in a Sociology Thesis I wrote a few years back (in college). Incidentally I did get 100% on that thesis! It was the only 100% I ever got. My Sociology Professor then read the book and she commented that she also thoroughly enjoyed it. I have shared and loaned it to countless people who have all had only positive words. In other words, I thought the book was a great read."
1,Well......At least the Title was interesting.....,"Ok I bought this book because I am, normally, a fan of Ray Buckland's work. However, when I read this I about choked on it. First off, the book was inredibly OVERLY simplistic and that would be great - if you are a beginner to The Craft. But - I wouldn't even recommend this to them due to the inaccuracies in the book. The photos that were included in the book were about the only thing that I found more interesting than the title of the book.As a Practicing Witch for almost 17 years, I tend to shy away from the beginner books; however, I do feel a responsiblity to pickup a few a year to review them and give advice on them to my coven dedicants. This book will go into my library; however, will NOT get recommended to my dedicants. There is so much *QUALITY* literature out there - do not rely on this.Buckland gets a lot of flack from time-to-time from the Pagan community; however, I have found his books to be informative - although reading like"
2,Not like the picture,The product I received didn't have the two pop ups/foils on the hood cover. I didn't think it was a big deal but without them the cover flaps up and down on the hood. This can cause damage to the paint. This is the one that supposedly matched my 2009 Tacoma Pre-runner.
3,For fans of the TV series,"If you have not seen at least a few episodes of the TV series it you may not enjoy this movie since it is set at the end of the series. There is no introduction to the charactors since it is expected you know them from watching the series. It's too bad that non of the TV series has been released in R1.Note: The english track has had all of the music replaced, and music has been added where there is non in the original. The Japanese track has not been changed."
3,Truly a crime that this is the release they chose for the US,"Wow. The fact that this rather muddled and non-representative OVA is the only Ghost Sweeper Mikami entry to make its way to our shores is nothing less than criminal. It's like putting out the Sailor Moon OVA/movies...and none of the series. Or the Fushigi Yuugi OVAs...and not the series. Or the Magic Knight Rayearth OVAs...and neither of the series. In other words, quite possibly the stupidest marketing decision EVER in the history of anime. It's almost like they were TRYING to sabotage acceptance of the series over here - put out the worst, least representative thing ever associated with the series, and when it tanks, oh well, we can say we tried!All I can say about this is somebody, please wake up and bring over the Ghost Sweeper Mikami series. It's funny, cute, and has some endearing characters (Okinu in particular). This OVA/movie is just a mess."
4,noisy but does good job,"Meets expectations. Noisy but not overwhelming. Becomes background ""white"" noise. Cleans air very well for rather large bedroom. would recommend"
4,Sequencing Grade K-2,"I teach Kindergarten in Australia. This book is a very practical resource, and I would recommend it to all teachers in grades K-2. It would also be particularly useful for children who might be experiencing difficulties in Grade 2 and Three. Some of the sequencing activities in the latter part of the book could also be used to help children plan simple narratives. The book is very reasonably priced. I was very happy with my purchase."
3,Sequencing...,Sequencing: Cut and Paste Activities is an okay book. It is nothing special. Each page has four pictures out of order inwhich the student cuts and glues in the correct sequence. It is straight forward and nothing special. what would of been nice is if the book had a story to match the pictures so students to demonstrate how to sequence. Would I purchase it again? Probably not.
2,Not for a 4 or 6 year old!,"(This is the same review for a few other products from this brand, they are all way too easy. I think this is more fun for a two or three year old). I should have paid attention to other reviewers. But it was so inexpensive I decided to give it a try. Ok, I like to think my daughter is the smartest 4-year old in town, but this is waaaaay too easy. She finished in two seconds. I purchased the brain quest book and it was so much more value for my money. Hundreds of pages and tons of fun."
2,Cheap Product,"Everything about this DVD holder is flimsy. The cover has the texture and feel of cheap vinyl waiting to tear. The inner pages are composed of flimsy plastic pockets that look like they will rip loose after a short time of use. I give the physical, practical use a 2 and the presentation of the holder a 1. Having received mine in the mail today I would now, not pay anything for this product. The only way I would own another is if it were given to me as a gift."
1,BEWARE ! Buy Pulleyn's (green) book not the orange book,"This rating is of the alternate paperback version of Pulleyn's book that Amazon lists on its website. Beware---this alternate version (with an orange cover) has no relationship to the book by Pulleyn (with a green cover) copyright 2000. It is a very sloppy reproduction of a 100 page typewritten manuscript by Harrison and Jordan with an original copyright date of about 1988. It is hardly readable and not acceptable.I do not mean to downgrade Pulleyn's book, but unfortunately, Amazon has both books and their reviews linked together as if they were the same. You must be careful when you order that you get the book you want."
2,"Decent Movie, But Tailored to a Very Specific Niche","This movie was very low budget, but surprisingly well done despite this. However, the movie revolves around a sorority where the members are united by their shared racial affiliation with a single demographic. I am not of that demographic, and I find it challenging to relate enough to make the film fully enjoyable. This is by no means to imply that I have any aversion whatsoever with that demographic, but the lack of commonality in humor, horror and other movie-relevant concepts does reduce my ability to enjoy the film. So my recommendation would be to evaluate whether this might apply to you and decide accordingly. Other aspects - the movie is ultra low budget, but the director does have decent enough directing/camera work skills to significantly reduce the impact of a small budget."
3,Tree Frog Floor Mats,We really like these floor mats. Not real happy with the wear-ability of them. The fibers are balling up and coming off in clumps and I would guess that there will be bare spots growing soon after only 5 weeks.
3,tiny mats,Tree frog mats are cute but are smaller than expected. I needed to leave my regular car mats under them.
5,Froggy addiction..,"Good quality for the price, if you are a frog fanatic like I am you will not be dissapointed with these floormats, I have also purchased other items as well that complete the decor in my car.."
5,Tree Frog Floormats,Excellent. Matched the back floor mats that I had purchased elsewhere. Nice stitchwork!
4,Very effective,Used effectively to cut holes in soapstone and it was very easy as long as you went slow and allowed for hard spots and the torque that results
2,Bamboozled,"This is a classic text and extraordinarily useful.Unfortunately, we thought we were purchasing the ""3 volume set"", but were sent only Volume 3. We are missing Volumes 1 and Volume 2. I am not certain where the fault lies, but if we are due to have Volumes 1 and 2, then please arrange to send them.""Buyer beware!""."
3,Long but Knowledgeable,In the lab where I work we have this volume. We were required to read certain parts if it. I liked how the books explained complicated parts of molecular cloning. The bad part the books are very long.
3,a formerly essential classic,"For many years the previous edition of this set was an essential reference in molecular biology labs. At present however, there are too many good protocol books out there to really make this argument. The book is pretty strong in explaining theory, and answering the question of why certain procedures are either necessary, useful, or worthless, however it is not as practical as many other books, such as Short Protocols. Still a good reference overall, but no longer stands alone, and I recommend checking out as much of the competition as possible before deciding whether to make the investment in it."
4,The holy scripture of molecular biology,This book is an invaluable resource for any serious practitioner of molecular biology. Content is detailed and comprehensive. Highly recommended reference source. All credit to the authors for what is a thorough revision of this latest testament of what is undoubtedly the revealed scripture of molecular biology. The website gives you access to all the printable protocols from the book and is perfect for lab bound grad student.
3,Gun cleaning patches,"I bought these for a 9mm but they are too small but it was my mistake, they are great for a smaller caliber"
1,Narrow Scope of Algebra,"I rated this product ""1"" which is unfair becauseI did not consider carefully enough the productdescription, ""Teaches functions, algebraic properties,linear equations."" This cdrom covers just this narrowscope of algebra. Given this, the price is too high.(Sorry Mr. Bezos. It's not your fault.) I receivedanother package at a lower price that includeda web-based tutorial and covers algebra entirely.In all fairness, the slivers of algebra coveredin this cdrom are covered very thoroughly."
5,A Classic,"It has been awhile since I read Kafka (the last time was in school) and I have been going back to reread books that I have not read in awhile. Though I remembered he book generally, over time I had forgotten some of the details which made the book fresh again.I do not recall what the last version was that I read, but I enjoyed this translation. From the moment we meet Josef K we are part of his nightmare and the absurd life around him.In the end the book was just as dark, confusing and thought provoking as I remember thinking it was when I first read it, which is why it became one of my favorite books."
5,What a wonderful nightmare!,"The Trial is like falling asleep into a splendid deleterious nightmare, with all of the dread and Angst, and never being quite able to find the code to lead oneself out of the intricately spun labyrinth. It surely will be a joy for those capable of opening up to Kafka's complex existential world. It is said that Kafka laughed obstreperously while reading this book. I tried to laugh along with him, but I believe there are a myriad of other approaches to this novella that are just as appropriate. I recommend to all."
5,The Greatest Book Ever Written Bar None,"Dense, atmospheric and truly haunting, Kafka's The Trial is quite possibly the greatest book ever written. The tale of one man's futile battle against bureaucracy, it is even more applicable to our meaningless, frustating modern existence than it probably was to turn of the century Prague. This new translation manages to capture Kafka's dark wit in a way that has never been done before - showing the author not only to be a true visionary, but an eccentric, funny human being as well. There is no doubt that it is complex and hard going, but the rewards that you may reap from perservering are more than worth the effort. And for those that fail to understand it, I suggest you take some time out for introspection - for this book may very well be the greatest comprehensive biography of our century."
4,"great thinker, creative writer","The metaphors and symbolism in this book are so liberating, ironically however, to speak about the oppression of totalitarianism in his time."
1,Surprise,"Ah ha!! Just to catch your attention, This novel is a ***** stars. A mind opener for every artist and surrealism fan out there, based on realistic social behavior and man made complex conditions upon himself overfed into detailed nightmarish perspectives from the subconscious. *****"
3,a classsic that i did not enjoy but did find interesting,"it is well written but the whole story made me increasingly tense and anxious, as well it should. this was not a book that was fun or pleasurable to read. but it was extremely interesting."
2,Yaaawwwnnnnnnn...,The opening sentence is the only thing I found interesting about this Novel. After the second chapter I get sick of the Qestions followed by almost next to no answers. I will try this book again when I am 30.
2,"Nice, but one major flaw ...","cdProjects makes nice cases, except for one thing ... they don't lay flat when open! Due to the spine design, the case only naturally wants to open about as far as is shown in the picture of the case Amazon shows at the top of this page. It *will* open further if you apply pressure to the front and back covers, but that is a very awkward and annoying operation to have to perform while also trying to carefully insert or remove a CD.It's unfortunate, because the construction of the cdProjects case and the CD sleeves are otherwise excellent. But Case Logic cases are also very nice, and they lay flat when open, which makes searching for and inserting/removing CDs much easier.I'll be sticking with Case Logic in the future."
1,Thumbs down to CD PROJECTS,"BUYERS BEWARE: my CD PROJECTS cd case ruined my cd's! when i tried to contact the company about their faulty product, they were entirely unhelpful. awful product, awful customer service. not recommended!"
3,Could be better...,"I just purchased the 92-capacity wallet. It's very roomy and built tough. I'm sure it'll last me forever. My gripe with it is in the fact that you can't open it and lay it flat. It will not stay open on its own, making putting in or taking out CD's a pain. You have to hold it open with one hand while trying to figit with the CD sleaves with the other. Overall, it's tough and will protect your CD's nicely, but you might want to shop around first."
3,SimCity 3000 Unlimited,"I have had MANY computer games (about 20,ALL of them EXTREMELY complex.),but NONE have had problems like SimCity 3000 Unlimited.I am not able to save my games."
5,Simply listen to it...and enjoy it!,"A concept album made with all the verve of the best Brazilian progressive rock. Since you listen to it, your soul will be touched by these beautiful piece of art. This platinum disc is a good sample of Brazilian rock ""golden years""."
2,Don't buy if you know the basics of Johnson's bio,"I was hoping to gain a better insight into RJ's life, but was dissappointed to find that the insert in the musical boxset I purchased was the same info. I also am a big fan of Keb' Mo and hoped to see a lot more of him so don't buy the video for that reason. I'll sell you my copy if you want it."
4,An introduction to robert johnson,A good intro to those like me who only knew of robert johnson through eric clapton doing his songs.There's a lot in this dvd about his past life from people who were there and really knew him.
3,"Robert Johnson, The Traveling Bluesman","this was a well presented documentry by danny glover, i gave it three stars because i really am not into these kinda films. I never heard of robert johnson until i saw this movie. I was impressed on how well this movie was presented. I think robert johnson is a great singer and it's too bad that he was taken away from us so soon. Hopefully his music will live on for another generation."
3,Not quite long enough...,"This DVD is a decent documentary of Johnson's life. I found the interviews with those who knew Johnson to be the best part. Johnny Shines and Honeyboy Edwards were both the best part. If your a fan of the Blues and Robert Johnson this is worth the money. However, my only complaints are that it wasn't very long and Danny Glover wasn't the best narrator for the documentary. The interviews and the music make the DVD worth the price."
2,I want my money back,If you are familiar with Robert Johnson's bio then you may not find this very insightful. I am a big fan of both he and Keb' Mo. I bought the video and found nothing in it about RJ that was not included in his box set and I saw very little of Keb' Mo. The limited time Keb was in shown playing was amazing but I wouldn't buy it again. I will sell you my copy if you really think you want it.
1,Deception,"Just a note that reviewer ""D. Halabu"" owns the company that makes these.I have never tried this product and cannot attest to its quality. My 1-star is simply to balance ""D. Halabu""'s 5-stars"
2,Rack is fine but can't be secured,"The rack itself is fine but there's no way to secure/lock this rack to a 1.25"" hitch. The hole in the rack is only 3/8"" wide but all locking pins are 1/2"". Having a rack full of expensive bikes with no way to lock them makes this rack essentially worthless.Allen Customer Service was extremely rude."
3,Bike Rack,My bike went on easy but my wife's and kids' bikes were hard to get onto the rack. Once everything was on it was secure.
4,Allen bike rack,Good basic bike rack. Holds four full-size bikes. Note strap to back of vehicle required to stabilize rack.
2,A disappointment,"While finding a line of salt free beans at a reasonable price was great, I have had a hard time using up these kidney beans, they are mushy; unpleasantly so. You'd think they would make a good bean in bean soup or refried beans, but I didn't think so. A friend tried them as a shortening substitute in cookies with the best results; taste was fine once she ran the beans through the food processer and added them to cookie dough - but what isn't. Blending them and then using them as an addition to soup or 'secret vegies' in meatloaf and the like may have been the best use.I did a little experimentation and evidently salt helps beans from turning unappealingly mushy. I've learned to either cook my own and add just a touch of salt or use a 'low salt' product. Color and size are good."
2,Disappointed,"While the beans can be overly soft, their flavor and quality are very good. Eden Organics is one of the few companies that use safe BPA-free can lining. Unfortunately, several of the cans in my recent order arrived dented. The outer box was not damaged, just the cans. Since denting compromises the safety of the contents, these had to be thrown out. I will not be ordering this online again--I'll go back to selecting individual cans in my local market."
3,7 dented cans,"Just received a shipment and there were 7 dented cans. Two were so badly dented that I discarded them.More than half of the beans were ""stuck"" together and came out broken and mushy. The previous orders weregreat. This one was not good at all. The current $20 price rise is a SHOCK. Subscription canceled."
1,No way do these beans taste like the others,The beans well taste better if you use a lot of spices and smash them up. But just by themselves. No way. Terrible taste
2,Dents in Cans,"I've enjoyed Eden products for a while.I've noticed over the last few years that more and more of than cans have dents in them. The problem isn't shipping, because the boxes are never damaged, but the individual cans are. It's unfortunate because the product really is good."
4,Excellent vegan preservative free product,"The quality of all Eden organic beans is excellent. Being preservative free with very little sodium (less than 100 mg per can), the flavor of the beans comes through and is excellent. This is particularly true of the kidney beans.The one small downside of the kidney beans is that they were a bit too soft; they tended to mash a bit more than I'd like, and they don't hold up well to boiling.Note that you'll find brown specks in some varieties of Eden beans. Do not be alarmed: the specks are kombu (kelp), an organic sea plant that's used as a natural preservative. The kombu can be consumed with the beans, or you can rinse it away."
5,Great Product!,Beans are one of the healthiest foods you can eat at a really low price. This is an awesome product. Thank you Eden Foods!
3,So-So Herzog,"Surprisingly straight version of Buchner's play by Herzog. Only two really interesting scenes in the film. One is the death scene in which Kinski and Eva Mattes play it to the hilt, and the other involves one of Herzog's trademark monkey scenes. It's not bad, just that after viewing Aguirre and Fitzcarraldo, you'll be expecting more."
4,Surprisingly Good,"Klaus Kinski portrays the title character in this taught, sad version of the play. We are treated to a baseline amount of Kinski raving (particularly during the scene in which he confronts his adulterous wife), but his performance is more subdued than usual, which is of course the point: Woyzeck's a beat-down man. (This could also have something to do with the fact that Woyzeck was shot hard on the heals of Nosferatu.) Herzog's usual invective against the military establishment, hucksterism and corruption in general is here evident. And, yes, there is a scene with a monkey. Overall, though, I was slightly surprised at the quality of the acting performances and delighted with Herzog's steady directorial hand. Woyzeck is an underrated film, and very worth watching."
2,clunky art-house fare,"Look, I appreciate that this film (1979) is based on a stage play (1836) that is highly regarded by critics, but it's hard to tell why judging from this film alone (or even from reading the play, whose reputation is such that it's actually included inThe Norton Anthology of World Masterpieces (Expanded Edition) (One-Volume)). The original play was left substantially unfinished at the time of the author's death, so what you see here is Herzog's (controversial) sewing-together of various plot elements, not to mention his chronologication.If you're unfamiliar with the material, you'll be beset by questions until nearly the end, and Herzog's direction careens from heavy-handed to indecisive throughout.As for Kinski, I'm not sure if he actually had any ideas for the role other than staring bug-eyed at the camera. He's far more compelling inAguirre, the Wrath of GodandFitzcarraldo."
2,sleeve hole breaks,"While they look great, the sleeves tend to break and tear near their binding. This causes the sleeves to fall out, which really defeats the purpose of a CD case. It looks great in the store but the real life functionality is only a 3/10.Go with something that is really bound or has rings."
4,Great brush!,"I ordered the 3"" brush and wished I ordered the larger 3.5"" size- the only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5. I have very long hair. However, I got great results with this brush. I have very thick, coarse, long, natually wavy hair that I blow out straight. This brush used with theSolano Supersolano 232K 1875 Watt Ceramic Tourmaline Hair Dryerresulted in straight, bouncy, shiny, soft hair with minimal effort."
4,Best history on the little-known Fort Drum,"A bit short and not much detail on WWII actions, hence the 4 stars. In all fairness, there may not have been many survivors from Ft. Drum after the ""Death March"".Good history and background with many rare construction photos and design diagrams. I liked the modern day follow-up photos of how it looks now or least in the 1990's. However, Ft. Drum's use or non-use during Japanese occupation was never really discussed, only the subsequent disablement when the Philippines were liberated.I would also recommend the Osprey Publications' booklet on Manila Bay defenses."
4,It's Still There,"I am a buff of the first year of the war in the Pacific which drew me to this book. It is not a page turner but it is an excellent reference book. One thing that stands out is how little it was used between the wars because of the nation's financial crunch. It is odd to say the least to see this ""ship"" rise out of Manila Bay. I was fortunate enough to get a tour of the bay in a Philippine Navy patrol boat and we circled Fort Drum. It gave me goose bumps."
3,not the right size cap!!!,"i wanted to replace my oil cap on my stang and when i place the order it look like it would fit , but it didnt. the order page always have a option to let you know if it would fit or not.this one didn't so i had to take a guess.thank god i didn't pay mostly anything for it.so i don't know what im gonna do with it.good luck when ordering this item."
1,lousy,"Oscar Hernandez is a fantastic piano player and musical director. For years, he has worked with the singer Reuben Blades. There was nothing instructional about this DVD, just footage of the band playing in the studio. A very mediocre product, which is a shame because Oscar Hernandez has so much to share with aspiring Latin piano players."
1,Salsa piano: Oscar Hernandez,"The title is so misleading. They mention that it reveals the secrets of Salsa, but they never show any instruction on how to play salsa piano. A band was just recorded playing and THAT'S IT. Good music, as stated, but nothing instructional. I WANT MY MONEY BACK..................SEÃ±or HernÃ¡ndez..............."
2,Great music. No instruction.,"I must agree with the others. This is a great opportunity to see some top notch players playing great music, but there's not a single scene devoted to actual instruction. Our four star friend has a great suggestion for making the most of this video, but that doesn't change the fact that the DVD is entirely performance."
5,REVIEW,This product was superb! It looked new and it arrived so quickly. I was not even expecting it but soon it was in my mailbox! thanks for your quick response to my purchase!
3,Good and bad,"Great remote, does what it is supposed to do. Setup is a no brainer with easy to navigate screens that guide you all the way. Love how it works, controls my TV, DVD, DVR,etc.....all without problems. Only catch is that it feels terrible in hand. I am used to the shape and functionality of the TIVO remote and I can barely stand to hold this thing. Metal-like buttons on either side of the small screen at top are not very touch friendly. My DVR from comcast requires that I use an ""A"", ""B"" or ""C"" button to confirm choices, scroll back on the guide and so forth and because of the closeness of the metal buttons and the location of alternative buttons this is not as comfortable as one would expect. Before you buy demo it out and make sure it feels comfortable to you."
4,"Great Features, so so Build Quality","Remotes features work great, combined 5 or 6 remotes into one. If a setting doesn't change properly a quick push of the help button always fixes the problem. I have had this remote for a month or two and am very happy with its functionality but am worried about its long term durability. The activities button has already lost it's ""click"" most of the time it is used and buttons get stuck down from time to time. All in all I got the remote for a little over $50 on sale from Amazon and would buy another logitech universal remote. I hope they work out the tactile feedback in new versions or at least on the higher end remotes."
2,You get what you pay for.,"This device looks good, has a nice feel but just doesn't compare to a Pronto. Tech support from Logitech is just okay, they don't get back to you with 2nd or 3rd level support. 1st level can't really answer many questions at all. I have issues with the remote being able to turn on the correct devices for the various activities I like to use with my home theater. Macro capabilities don't really exist and for any serious home theater aficionados this device just doesn't cut the mustard. It is a good universal remote with some extra features not offered by the typical universal but it's not worth the additional price. If you are a serious home theater user get a Pronto."
5,perfect,I now have three Harmony 550s in two different homes. It does everything you ask it to do. The programming takes a little time but made easier when you have all the info in advance re: models and settings on all devices. I have not experienced one problem with any of them. Great value and it takes all the other remotes out of the picture.
2,Not a keeper,"I needed to replace my Harmony 659 that had given out after a year and a half. I very much like the concept of the harmony remotes using the activity based approach. Even though I think my 659 should have lasted longer, I purchased the 550. Overall it is a very sharp looking remote. I programmed it today, very easy and started to use it. I will be returning this afternoon. The buttons are way too close together and require too much pressure to make contact. Rather than use the ""base"" of my thumb or finger I would have to tilt my thumb at a right angle to get the right button and be able to depress it far enough (hey! maybe you got big thumbs!). I think I'll get the 670."
1,Utterly Useless,Found this remote to be utterly useless. The software seems to require a fast internet connection to program it. I have one. Unfortunately the logitech server keeps failing. Expensive time wasting rubbish.
1,Save your money!,"The buttons don't respond well. You must turn off the devices with the remote power button only otherwise you are in for a ridiculous step by step turn on process. It's not as smart as people make it out to be. Every time you try to do something you have to scroll through an unorganized, and non-customizable menus... i hate and refuse to use mine. waste of money."
1,Pure Jink,"This item is pure junk. When i got it it had a ton of synching issues which none of my other Harmony remotes (one and 850?880?) had. Now i decided to move this remote into a different room and it still won't sync. 4 out of 5 Windows machines won't see it and the only one that sees it sees it as ""AVERTV"" but won't find a driver. So i'm stuck not being able to use it."
2,don't believe the usability hype,"After spending about an hour configuring this remote, to replace two of my other remotes, I was not able to set up ANY of its functionality to make me want to pick it up.The simple activities I tried didnt work at all (the help button failed to learn anything), so I set up the controls by device. After getting all the buttons nicely mapped, I realized I'd rather just pick up my other dedicated remotes (which already have perfect button mappings!) than to press a minimum of 3 buttons to switch device and do something using the Harmony 550."
1,Good idea but bad design and function.,"This thing is totally useless. Very difficult to operate, ergonomics are terrible. Buttons are small and shallow, can only press them with finger nails. I got this for free with TV purchase, now it resides in the junk drawer. One good thing is I got a free set of batteries out of it. Get yourself a $10.00 walmart remote."
4,Great choice!,"Purchased the Logitech Harmony 550 Universal Remote based upon review on this site and others. Must say that I am very pleased with the purchase!Set-up was simple, and the remote worked perfectly right away. All of my components (Plasma TV, Cable DVR, Audio receiver, etc..) now can be controlled by ONE remote -- love it !Only negative, and it's minor, is that the 'number' buttons on the remote are rather small and placed together compactly. But, it is minor, as I'm getting accustomed to it. (hence, the reason for 4 stars out of 5)Also, shopped several sites, and Amazon had the BEST price...saved @ $20 over Best Buy & Circuit City.Overall, I would highly recommend this product."
3,Good Idea - Not so Easy to Use,"Great Idea behind it - I got it free - saves a lot because it's the one-stop shop of remotes - but setting up wasn't so fun nor easy and you have to pick your device each time you need to select a device to control. Too many buttons to push just to get to access one thing. Can't see all of the other devices menus either - which is bad if you are trying to adjust settings and such. So while you have this remote sitting around, you wind up using the original anyway - which just adds to the clutter of remotes. This remote serves as a good backup if you lost the original remote someowhere in your house or you're too lazy to get off your lazy butt to look under the couch cushions. HA!"
4,Programming the Logitech 550,"Programming the Logitech Harmony 550 using the Software is self driven and easy to follow.However, the IR Components Library is large but still missing some and customizing applications and activities outside wizards is not realy user friendly.Using the Logitech Harmony 550 is a nice experience.The touch and the look of the Logitech Harmony 550 gives a professional feeling."
4,very nice,"i got this unit and it seemed to work perfectly, until i left it alone for a few minutes and the GLOW light would not turn off. i read up on the internet and found out that a couple of units would not automatically turn the backlight off, due to an issue with the internal clock.i returned it and got a replacement unit from amazon, and it worked perfectly. setup is a little complicated at first, but once you realize what's going on its a cinch. one of the most welcome features is the ability to tailor the warmup time of your tv. my LCD tv takes 10 whole seconds to boot up (power saving mode) and at first it would not set itself to the correct input, but after tweaking the remote settings a bit, i got it to wait 10 seconds before changing to the correct input.very beautiful, elegant remote. have not fully tested the battery life yet but it seems to output a powerful signal- more powerful than my original remotes."
3,Logitech Harmony 550 Universal Remote,"The remote itself is nice. The software to program it isn't. After a 56 megabyte download of the software (required), I was disappointed in that it would not let me customize the LCD screens for each device. You get a generic list of selections, most of which have nothing to do with your device. I can't believe that much software is so inflexible."
4,"Excellent remote, better than expected","This is one of those products that 'just works'. I had it programmed and up and running inside about 15 minutes. It had all the codes for my Sharp LCD, Oppo DVD player and Motorola DVR. I didn't have to show my less technically inclined roommates how to use it, so it's definitely intuitive. It's also much more attractive looking than the larger boat shaped Harmony models, if you care about aesthetics.The number keys at the bottom *are* quite hard to hit, but I rarely use these so it's not an issue for me."
3,Works great! Needs better Mac suppoort.,"This remote works flawlessly, once you can get the software installed and working. If you use a PC, you're fine. If you have a Mac on the other hand, it may work for you, and it may not. The problem is that when it doesn't work, the chance of getting any kind of support form Logitech is well, nigh impossible.Again, using the remote is no probllem. It's getting it working if you use a Mac that is the problem.I'm rating this a 3 because the Mac support for the product is very bad. Logitech was unable to route my call to any enginerr that could help me resolve my problems.That is enough to turn a 5 to a 3..."
3,Mixed feelings,"The potential this remote has is incredible, but I've had it for almost a week and still can't make it control my six devices after about five cumulative hours and three different communications with logitech. I think if I have patience I might be able to get it to work as I wish, but I probably wouldn't buy this again as I feel a small part of me die each hour I spend trying to program this device."
3,Overall not bad,"The remote itself LOOKS beautiful. The instructions say to change the batteries first thing, so I put in the extra batteries that came with it, and they're dead. When I get it to turn on, the buttons in the middle of the remote, elongated rubber buttons, are nearly impossible to use. you have to use your fingernail to push them all the way in to the remote for them to register. I never thought I would need to install software to use a REMOTE CONTROL, but I guess it's not the worst thing in the world. I do not like the fact you have to assign an activity to do anything, you can't just turn a device on/off by pushing the power button."
4,great for the price,"great little device and for the price cant go wrong , i just use it for tv,dvd and stereo /surrond sound.minor after pressing on botton keep pointing to devices for 15 seconds, have to hold remote center to all of the or one wont go on.problem is inconsistent for changing visio tv from hdmi 1 to hdmi 2, but as soon as you hit help button it switches.would buy again"
4,Easy and pretty comprehensive,"This is so easy to set up and even easier to use! My wife can't seem to remember that the cable box controls the channel not the TV. Now we don't have to worry about that. All the functions are as simple as two button clicks away. The motion sensing light is pretty cool too.The only down sides to this are the primary button arrangement, screen size, and the lack of easy programing of deep menu functions. I think the activity selection buttons are to small for bottons that are used so often. I would also like to see a bigger screen. Some functions for the TV or stereo are more dificult to program. For instance to change the sound field effect fo the stereo or to change the screen aspect on the TV. These functions are simple on the TV or stereos' native remote and not so simple on the Harmony 550.Overall a great remote for a great price. We may get another for the bedroom in a couple of months."
5,just awesome,"this remote is amazing, we first went with a cheap $20 remote and it didnt really support hardly anything and our equipment that it did support it didn't support correctly this remote first try supported everything. It was defintily a good investment. It gives us all the functionality of all the original remotes and we never ever get them out. We recomend it so much that we got it as gifts for some other people too. No need to buy a more expensive one this one is perfect."
5,GREAT REMOTE,Made my life so much easier. I'm no longer embarrased by my friends who wonder how the heck to turn on all my equipment and what settings to get sound out of the receiver. This thing is so versatile! Highly recommand the harmony series.
2,"Remote good, Software BAD!","The remote seems okay, but prepare yourself for spending hours upon hours in front of your computer trying to program it, going back to the TV, finding that it STILL doesn't work, going back to the computer, fussing with settings, back to the TV, etc. etc. I have wasted way too much time on this remote, and I'm about to take it back and try another brand. I liked the idea of programming it with my Mac but the software just sucks. I should have paid attention to the other reviews stating the same thing."
2,Not the best.....,"This remote has lots of promise, but falls short. No matter how many times I update the settings, it can't remember them. I seem to be pressing the ""Help"" key to fix things more than just hitting ""Watch TV"" and getting what I want."
5,Worth the money.,"I was a little hesitant before purchasing it because previous experiences with universal remote controls. I never got one that could totally replace my other remotes.I friend at work told me about this remote and that Amazon had it at discount price, so I decided to give it a shot. I couldn't have made a better purchase. I've been using it for about a month now, and I love it.Setting it up was a wonderful experience, and everything worked just right the first time around.It is a great product for the price (if they still have the same price here at Amazon)."
1,Harmony 550,"Despite Logitech's claims that it has a comprehensive online library of codes for many thousands of devices, there was no code for my very common Sony amplifier. I finally got the remote to work reasonably well, but it required four hours of fine-tuning its settings. There is a tech support line, but the wait time was horrendous, and they kept dropping my call.If you are interested in buying this remote, it would be wise to call or write Logitech first to confirm that they have codes for each of your devices. Also, even when there is a code, it is necessary to reprogram the LCD display to make the most-used commands easily accessible.I don't regret the purchase, but I would only recommend it to folks who have a lot of patience and fair degree of technical aptitude."
2,Not for big hands,"This is a very nice looking remote and easy to set up but just not easy to use compared to other remotes. Buttons are small, too close together and do not press smoothly. Also the remote seems very delicate and easy to break. I've tried this one and the Harmony 880 and ended up selling both on eBay and bought a Universal MX-500. I'm much happier, though it is ugly it much more practical and easer to use."
2,Disposable Remote,"This remote will not last if you use it regularly. Functions well, easy to program, but buttons are too flimpsy. After a couple of months of buying this, the off button stopped working. I just reprogrammed one of the other buttons to act as the off button, then one by one, more buttons stopped working. One year after buying this, about 10 buttons no longer work.. This is with light use. Do not buy this if you need a long lasting remove."
5,Love my remote,"OK.. so I also dropped this remote. The LCD screen went and Logitech replaced it. They ROCK!PROS:1. Controls my TIVO, H/K AVR 635, 3 HDMI switch, old radios around the house....2. Feels great3. Works better than the DirecTV remote.4. Logitech Customer Service is #1CONS:1. I use VirtualBox on Linux to program my remote with Logitech's Software. The software is AWESOME. I just havent got the linux version to compile correctly so that is the only CON for me... not that big of a deal... problem solved through VirtualBox..."
3,ok,"this product works great...until the buttons go...especially the top buttons by the led screen. 2 out of the 4 don't work anymore, so I can't watch the vcr, or listen to cd's, and one more is starting to go...so soon i won't be able to watch dvd's...then it's time to go."
1,Started out great!,"I received the remote in January. I found it easy to program, all the devices I own were in the database. I found the remote *very* useful once you learn how to use it. However, it now locks up about 3 times a day. I'm hoping Amazon will come through for me and exchange it, if so I may buy the more sophisticated color model. I would recommend that anyone considering this or another Logitech remote take a look at the forums on logitech.com first..."
1,NOT reliable,"The 550 is the most problem-plagued piece of AV equipment I've ever owned. I am now on my third one in the past 18 months. Each one has been replaced under warranty, but that doesn't take away the fact that they are a piece of junk. Each of the first two had button failures within 9 months of receiving them. I'm just saying....AVOID THIS REMOTE LIKE THE PLAGUE."
2,Looks nice but doesn't work well.,"Good: The setup isn't too difficult and it does work with my receiver, DirectTV HD DVR, TV, Oppo DVD player, and Xbox. The activity feature is nice and works almost perfect 99% of the time.Bad: The number buttons are way too small. The previous button at the menu level doesn't always work. The biggest problem: The buttons feel ""mushy"" and you have to really, really press down to get them to work."
1,Mixed review,Overall I have not been pleased with the remote. We have had to re-sync the remote twice and will have to do it again. For some reason it will not turn on the PVR when the TV comes on so you have to go through several steps to get the PVR on and the TV to work. It does have a great help feature and will walk through yes and no questions to help you reslove the issue.
2,Not intuitive and buttons do not work after a few months,"The setup and design of this remote is not very intuitive. The computer interface requires navigation through multiple screens and many of my products required quite a bit of playing around before they worked like I wanted. However, after a few hours of setup, most things worked fine.My biggest gripe though is that about a year after buying this remote, many of the buttons don't work. In fact, pretty much all of the buttons we use on a regular basis are completely useless. This despite the fact that we have taken extremely good care of it and it still looks like new.Also, a number of our electronics aren't supported by the remote such as our Sony Google Bluray. I'm sure it would function with a lot of work on my end but since the buttons don't work it would be a waste of effort.I am very unsatisfied with this purchase."
2,What the H*ll?,"This remote, two years ago, was $50. At that price, it's a great remote that has made using my system much easier. But, this gauging of the price for all their remotes to aver $100 is ridiculous!Honestly, I wouldn't buy this remote at this price. It's crazy. Go for a different company."
3,ok remote,"I am a Macintosh person and it works fine, the functions are a bit clunky for the devices I am trying to control but so far it has done all I want. For the price it's fine."
1,Never worked...,"As other reviewers have said, the software setup requires a little more than simply knowing the model number of the devices that one wants to control with the device. After spending a good deal of time installing the latest software and setting up the remote, there were a couple of issues with the remote. Some of the ""activities"" that I had set up were not working as programmed in the software. The ""help"" button located on the remote itself was practically useless as it asked the same question over and over without any changes to the activity. Finally, the remote would frequently ""freeze"" leaving no option but to remove the batteries to ""reboot"" the remote. After calling tech support and having the person that I talked to get confused over ""component"" and ""device"", I decided to pack it up and send it back to Amazon. Great concept, bad execution."
5,Lives up to billing... You'll NEVER buy another remote!,"For months my wife had pestered me about getting a universal remote yet my understanding of the technology was mixed. I think we've all tried those crappy devices that learn your remote through infra-red scans. The process is tedious and the end result always had me clammoring for something better, something like the Logitech Harmony!This device is straightforward enough for anyone to understand and easy enough for my wife (technology challenged!) to appreciate and use. Other Logitech models seemed to offer better displays with full-color images and the ability to learn more devices. But it wasn't enough to justify the cost difference for what was initially an uphill battle in our house. This is one case where the entry-level model is more than sufficient for most."
4,Was almost about to return this one...,"I bought this remote for $50 from Amazon. At my first attempt it did not work with 2 of my devices. After some researching on the internet, I was able to fix my problem. Although, it still cannot control the Video2 Input properly on my Aiwa mini-sytem. I have stopped using that input because of that reason now. That is why i am giving it 4 stars instead of 5."
5,"Excellent product, works great","I just bought this remote and am already in love with it. Setup did take some time, but most of that was spent trying to collect all of the model information from my various components. The software had to down load two different sets of software updates. Their wizard was pretty easy to follow. I did customize one button because the remote doesn't have a standard ""display"" button for DVD players, but even that change wasn't difficult. With the exception of the one button everything worked right away. Just make sure you follow directions and you shouldn't have a problem. I was surprised to find that it even had the codes for my new converter box (to convert over the air HD signals). I highly recommend this product."
2,PITA,"I hoped this would simplify my 6+ remote system, no such luck.First of all, Logitec needs to find someone to write an instruction manual , instead of a multi language cartoon. Speaking of which they carry the cartoon feature online with the setup...looks like the instructions for an 8 track tape player. Anyway I setup my components test it out, My receiver does not turn off (among other problems i listed on a post it to fix).I try several times to fix that and other problems with online help to no avail. The remote also has all of the button functions of EACH remote on a 6x scroll, which makes it very tedious to do simple functions. I am a very patient techno-able person, and could probably tweak this thing into submission, but life is too short.I returned it."
5,Love this remote,I just recently recieved this remote and I love it. This remote is really easy to set up and even got it to work my Apple TV. I went from 7 remotes to one. Enough said!!
2,Screen died after about a year,"About 50% of the pixels on the screen went out after about a year of usage. A week later, another 50% of the remaining pixels went out. Most of the functionality (for my purposes) remains, but I expect more out of a remote in this higher price range."
4,logitech harmony 550 review,"had the product for a few months. quite happy with it.successfully replaced the remotes for the following:* jvc dvd player* samsung tv* onkyo receiver* sharp vcr* motorola cable boxalso use it to set tv/receiver/power on-off modes for:* apple tv* sony ps2product exceeded my expectations. has very fine tuning capability.my samsung tv has a crappy reaction time to its own remote so oncein a while the modes do not change directly, and i have to use afew additional steps on the remote. but it passed the wife andguest tests :) so that's saying a lot for ease of use.the text is a little hard to read in the blue backlighting. also i didn't think too much about it, but having the buttons lit is an useful feature that it lacks. other than that it's great!"
5,Works flawlessly,"I bought this product 2 months back. It works flawlessly with my TV, Music System, cable box, Blue Ray Disc player, laptop and my Wii.Its the best value for money remote in market."
5,Royal Remote,"My wife bought me this for an annniversary present. I think it was to help her to turn all of the stuff on. I received it in about three or four days and I must say it was a perfect gift. We have a DVD/VCR, TIVO, Cable Box, Home Theater System and a 65"" HDTV. I had some problems getting it programmed and called customer support. The guy assisted me on a Sunday until it was totally setup the way I wanted it. The CS was tops and now the remote is perfect. It controls most of the functions of the cable box and the only other remote I need is for the PS3. It is Blue Ray and this is IR. But I knew that before. I could not ask for anything more in a remote. Buy it you will love it."
5,Pretty darn good,"This remote is great with just a few things that could be improved.pros - it easily controls all my equipment, replacing 5 remotes, including xbox 360.the setup wizard is great and gets pretty much everything right. the customizable buttons are a great way to deal with those specialty commands. the remote is light and ergonomic.cons. control software does not work with osx 10.5 yet (although they claim a compatible update is coming soon) some of the buttons could have better 'action' meaning that you sometimes have to press them a couple of times to get the desired results, they are a bit 'squishy' and don't give a good tactile feedback."
4,Logitech Harmony 500 remote,"Took a while to finally get it programed correctly. Once I finally got it programed properly, it works great. Not as easy to program as they make it seem"
4,True universal remote,"This remote allows you to use all the true features of the actual remotes it's replacing. It has worked great for me. I use it for my HDTV, HD DVD, TiVo, Receiver and iPod docking station. It takes a little time to set up, but it's worth it not to have to keep up with 6 different remotes and still be able to use all the features and functions of my entertainment system."
1,Don't buy this,"I bought this to allow me to control a Sony TV, Sony Blueray, Sony DVD, and 2 Panasonic DVRs. First off Logitech requires you to log on to the web and save all of the setting to their website. You need to list each piece of equipment that you want to control. This is a manual process, so you need to have all the model numbers written down or you are going to be walking back and forth to the computer. I'm an application engineer and I had trouble selecting the right configurations and options that I wanted. Not a very friendly process.Tried to contact Logitech support. What a joke.I finally got feedup and returned the unit for a refund."
1,cant get it to work,"not only does it not worked, but it messed up the other remotes.very frustrating."
1,Expensive remote,The LCD screen is hard to see. It is awkward to use. It is difficult to program and then macros do not do what they are supposed to. I returned it and bought a Sony.
2,Loved it but after about a year...,"After about 1 year, the programmable button on the lower left of the display screen stopped working. Now I'm going to have to move the functions I've programmed for that button off to other buttons. I have remotes that are 10 years old and all of the buttons still work."
2,Confusing,"The remote is beautiful, yes. Unfortunately, Logitech made it as confusing as possible to properly operate. You start by hooking it up via USB to your computer, selecting your devices, and setting up certain functions that you want the remote to perform. All is well until one of those functions gets out of order. For example, if you turn off the television manually, the next time you go to use the remote control, it will think that the tv is still on because you didn't turn it off with the controller. As a remedy, you'll have to go through a cycle of questions that the remote will ask you, which will re-callibrate it. It's a decent remote, it's just so unintuitive!"
3,OK,"I've had to restart this remote by taking the batteries out due to it freezing. Other than that, it is ok."
1,Doesn't work in all situations,"We spent several weeks trying to make this remote work with our equipment (an HD Motorola Cable Box, Sony TV, Tivo and Panasonic DVD/VcR). We had the Cable company check, Tivo check, and BestBuy where we bought the TV came out three times. There is only one way to wire the whole system and that way would not work with the remote. We spoke to Logitech many times, but they were unable to make it work. (Sometimes it's very annoying to try to talk to someone with a thick accent who is telling you technical stuff.) Anyway, they finally agreed the remote would not work with the way the equipment is wired, so in other words, it doesn't work in all situations. My advice, try to get it set up quickly in order to get a refund if it doesn't work."
1,"Remote ok, software fatally flawed","The software you use to program the remote requires you to log in every time you start it, and times out after a while, requiring you to log in again. If your internet connection is down, or if the website at the other end is down (happening right now as I type), you will NOT be able to program your remote!"
1,If you have older components you may be in for disappointment,"This could have been a great gadget except it didn't recognize my 5 year old Sony A/V receiver. Even in ""learning mode"" this new dog couldn't learn old tricks."
1,Harmony 550,"I purchased two of these things as Christmas gifts and found them to be so difficult to set up and so unreliable that I found myself unable to give them away. Tech support was no help. Level one support went through the same things I had already done, and referred me on to level two support. Level two support sent one Email saying they couldn't get in touch with me. I had stayed home all day the day they were to contact me. I Emailed back indicating that I was there and asked that they try again. No further contact was the result. I don't think my situation was all that unique, Olevia TV, Samsung DirecTV box, Sony DVD player. Should have been easy, anything but. All in all, I would rate it a ZERO but one is as low as I can go."
4,Great but has it's problems,"This is a great remote but it also has its problems. I really love the one button function control but sometimes the stuff that is suppose to turn off, doesn't. But if you still have the help button active it will turn it off. I still have some programming to do but this is a very fun remote. It even works my xbox 360 and xbox 360 hd dvd player. Now what other remote does that. You can't buy a $10.00 remote from Wal-Mart to do that now can you?"
4,what most audio / video systems need to make life good,at least 95% of my audio / video customers need this remote so they can put all their other remotes away. pick what you want - watch dvd / watch pvr etc. and every thing is turned on you need and every thing you don't need is turned off. no wrong buttons. a help button that helps.
5,working great,could not be happier with this remote. I have one in living room and one in bedroom. I refer the form factor to the 8xx series of remotes. If you use a dvr the transport buttons are in just the right spot.Do keep an eye out for prices. I paid fifty seven in december and fifty four bucks two weeks ago. list price on harmony is meaningless they are frequently discounted to considerably less than half.
3,Wanted to love it - but has some problems,"I wanted to love this great looking remote and toss our ""remote caddy"", but this one has some issues.Good:1) Activity buttons, turn on/off, set inputs without having to use 3 remotes - very cool - although it can take a while to get it set just right.2) Good back light - can see it in the dark3) Looks good and feels good in your hand4) Can personalize just about everything - if you have the patienceBad:1) SLOW - especially arrow keys are much slower than the remote that came with DTV DVR. Causes you to frequently back up and re-navigate.2) Don't like the stiffness/""click"" in the arrow, volume and channel buttons - prefer the soft/silent feel of the original remote (some would say this is mushy and don't like it - guess this is a personal preference)"
4,Lacks very little to achieve perfection,"It works almost flawlessly. It takes some time to configure it correctly, but it has a huge device database.I miss a more low-level way to program it (a scripting language would be good enough)."
4,Could use a better screen and buttons.,"I thought that the screen on this remote was hard to read in a dim room. The buttons dont feel right either. Otherwise, this remote does great!"
4,Worth the trouble,"First off, let me say that this remote is a real pain to set up. It takes time, hair-pulling, and a few swear words. BUT once you have it right, it is worth the effort. Also the Logi-Tech technical assistance staff are the pleasantest, most helpful I have encountered in a long, long time."
4,One of the best remotes for the $,"Does everything you need for a med-high end theater system (minus a fancy color screen on the remote.) Will also control lighting and projectors, etc. You have to sign up online to set up the remote, but let me tell you it's well worth it. I have a lot of experience with home theater remotes and the online programming is quick and accurate. A big time saver, and you can still add custom buttons and functions if you want. The only drawback and the reason it doesn't get a 5 is that some of the buttons feel flimsy and the remote feels fragile in general, but everything works and very well at that. Definitely worth a look."
5,great remote,I think this remote is awesome. I went from tree remotes to one!! easy to use. The hardest part is getting the real model numbers of your devices.
2,does what it's supposed to but it doesn't hold up.,"yes, programming this remote is very simple and very easy to use. It only took me about half an hour to set up maybe less. I was very impressed with how the unit interfaced with everything. That said, within two weeks the bottom of the LCD display started to not display properly and I've only had this product for a little over a month and I've already had to replace the batteries. I would recommend going one step higher! I think I'm going to try...Update: This product is completely starting to fail me completely! It burned through the most recent set of batteries in two weeks and the display is now completely unreadable! As soon as I can afford it I'm going to upgrade. This remote is not worth the money at all!"
2,Disappointing,"The remote works, and the activities-based interface is nice. However, if you want to control a single advice, the lack of hardware keys is a major detraction. Unfortunately, the overall experience is more frustrating than convenient."
2,A work in progress.,"The reason I gave it two stars is that it is still a work in progress. I got this for my mom, because she had difficulties using three different remotes to get a DVD to play. However, the screen with the custom buttons is way too small. This also makes the Help function completely useless to her.What I had to do is map some random button on the remote to specific functions. A is Input Next for TV, B is Input next for DVD, etc...And now there is a cheat sheet for the remote.Also, I had problems syncing it to my laptop. The tech support was usefully, and told me not to have the batteries in the remote when I sync. That solved the problem.Bottom line: If you have more than two remotes, and you can read font size of 10, and you like to play around with technology, then you will like this.If you are looking to get this to an elderly individual to make their life easier, look elsewhere. One For All makes rather nice products, and that's what we went with. URC3300"
2,Could be better,"I like that you can set it up to perform multiple functions with one press of the button, this feature would be great if it actually worked right more than 50% of the time. Half the time, the TV doesn't turn on from the first try - same goes when I try to turn it off."
3,Nice... could be better,"Looks great. No problem setting up my TV/DVD(Sony/Panasonic). I was excited when it controlled my HP laptop! Display screen can show only 4 options in one page. Has to scroll too many screens to control individual settings of a device (TV/DVD). Make sure you customize the buttons and store frequently used commands in the first/second page of the display. Cant turn on my dvd player separately (I know there's a way to do it). Always have to use ""Watch a DVD"" activity from the remote to start my dvd player. Volume +-/Channel+- buttons are little hard to press. Have to use 2 hands when choosing a button next to remote's display. Dint come with a printed manual. Software is ok to use. May be I shud have considered Harmony 880."
4,Quite Good - But Some Buttons are small,Setup was easy. A bit more up-front information around what the steps are would be helpful - I have setup much more complicated remotes (requiring much more programming) and I found it at times counter-intutive when specific decisions are being madel.All harmony remotes have the same capabilities. The differences are in how many units the remote will control and the button layout. The remote itself is quite good. Only complaint for this specific design is that there is not a set of buttons that easily access / manage DVR recordings. I've used the A and B buttons on the lower right of the remote - they work just fine for the task but the labeling is not intutive nor are the buttons big - and they are used all the time.
1,Harmony 550 disharmony,"I think the people that designed this remote had very small hands, the buttons a ridiculously small. The programing works well, but you will spend many hours learning how. If you need phone help, forget it. you will spend an hour listening to the same song before you hang up. Im still waiting for my E-mail response. Ted"
4,great help function,"This took a little while to tweak on initial setup, but had no problems with it since. If you power everything off and one device doesn't turn off, hit help and 99% of the time catches it and completes the process.Lights come on when you get near it, wish they stayed on longer."
5,Amazing device!!,"I recently brought my TV situation into the 20th century, complete with flat screen, DVD, surround sound, XM and iPod sound capabilities. I ended up with 4 remotes and needed a spreadsheet to figure out how to turn anything on. I bought the Harmony 550 universal, connected it to my computer, downloaded the software, plugged in all the components I have and VOILA! This one remote is amazing. It even let me custom program buttons that I use most. After years of using multiple remotes for stuff, this was a no brainer purchase. = )"
5,Best remote I ever had,I was a little skeptical at first when purchasing this remote because i thought it would give limited functionality as apposed to the factory remotes for my AV reciever and cable box as well as PS2. But after running through the setup on my pc and testing this is by far the Best remote i ever owned. I was able to program all my devices easily. Only drawback is some functions on the remote you have to hunt for but other than that they are there and it works great. I strongly recommend this product if you are looking to scale down the number of remotes used for your entertanment systems.
1,Remote died after 1.5 years of light operation.,"The LCD died after 1 year and 5 months of light operation. Logitech refused to service the unit because it is out of warranty. After about 1 year the unit would have a success rate of 50% when i tried to turn on my TV, even if I was very careful to point the unit directly at the tv. Just thought I'd warn everyone before you waste your money. If you must have it then get an extended warranty if you can. This is my second logitech product that failed prematurely. Lesson learned."
4,"Nice remote, bad numbers buttons","I was looking for one remote to get rid of all the other remotes that I had for my tv, dvd, sound surround...etc..etc. This remote was great accept for one main problem, the size of the numbers. Not exactly the best design. I don't really have 'fat fingers' but the numbers are so small, and close together, that it makes it hard to press the numbers and change channels. For now it gets the job done but I wish I would have bought a different one, and will in the future.Otherwise, it's a good all around remote for the price."
4,Very good indeed,"Best value for the money, really; the only ""con"" is that it does not handle very well my TV's input states; e.g. when the TV is started, if SCART does not detect any transmission on it (pin 8), it goes to Antenna/Cable; if it does, it switches directly to SCART input, if no signal is detected on Antenna/Cable; but the remote cannot handle this indeterminism; so I have to make sure I stop all signals when I switch devices... otherwise no problems so far with it; I recently purchased the 670 remote, due to arrive in a few days; I am curious about the performance of 670 rechargeable vs 550 regular batteries"
4,Solid Universal Remote for the price,"I own the Harmony 880 for my main entertainment set-up. I bought the 550 for my bedroom tv/DVD set-up and it has prefermed great. I do miss some of the features that the 880 has like the buttons glow when the remote is tilted. This helps to see the buttons in the dark quite well. The 550 will do this but only when I first pick it up, not when I have been watching a show for a few minutes. But there is a glow button that I can press so not a huge deal. All in all for the price, I think this is a good value. You must be comfortable programming it using the wizard on your computer though. The software is pretty good but it is sometimes difficult to figure out where options are located."
5,True to its claim,It is a perfect universal remote if you have 4 or more devices to control. Installing the software may take little more than what it should. Soon after installation - you answer the questions and enter the model number of the devices you would like to control. Thats it - it is all set for you to have one single remote which will deliver (as promised) and has beautiful glow at the touch of the glow button. Highly recommended for all those with some exposure to using programmable devices. If you are scared to touch a PC - don't buy this.
4,Harmony 550 is good,I think the Harmony 550 remote is much better than the more expensive Harmony 880 remote. I had an 880 but it was lacking in quality.The Harmony 550 does not have a battery charger like the Harmony 880. The 880 charger does not work properly. The Harmony 550 uses 4 AAA batteries. The display screen is a little smaller on the 550 but it really doesn't make that much difference.The Harmony 550 has all the same functionality of the Harmony 880 but it much less expensive. It seems to be constructed better than the 880 as well.
1,Get a Universal Remote R50 instead,"Harmony Remotes simply can't control all my devices. The only remote I've ever found that is easy to set up and, can control every device I own with the press of one button is the Universal Remote R50. The R50 does it all and then some, making Harmony remotes look like an overpriced paperweight.Pick one up for under $80 and you will never go back to the overpriced garbage that is Harmony. Anyone that disagrees with me is simply wrong and has not had the first hand experience as I have. I've used over 30 different universal remotes in my lifetime and nothing beats the Universal Remote R50.Universal Remote Control URC-R50 Digital R50 Universal Remote Control"
2,The word STINK comes to mind,"This remote stank. Ugh. It was so cool to look at and I was so in love with the idea of it. I thought my husband would be thrilled to get this for Christmas! He never really did like it, but we both tolerated it. I guess I thought I'd figure it out as time went on. In the end, though, it just stopped working, before it was even close to a year old. We replaced it with a dime-a-dozen remote.Word association? Me: STINK. Husband: POC. (piece of c...)"
1,Internet only setup,I used this for a couple of weeks. There is one major flaw in this remote. You can only setup the remote if you have a internet connection. As I write this their network seems to be down. That means I can not setup the remote at this time. What if logitech goes out of business or just decides to stop supporting this remote? Then the remote becomes useless because I won't be able to set anything new up.I actually like everything else about the remote but this one thing is enough to make want to find a different remote.
4,Works as advertised,"Decent product. Some things are a tad misleading. For example; the power button can only be used as a power button when using the ""Activities"" macros and not when addressing a specific component (Like, if I select TV to use that profile for my TV, the power button is not programmable or usable. It can only power cycle the TV once I do something like ""Watch TV"" in the Activities macro, and then it will power off all components used in that macro - my receiver, monitor, and DVR).Aside from that, not a bad little unit. It even works with my Mac Mini. RF ONLY!"
5,How can it get any better than this?,"Logitech sells several models above the 550. Honestly, I cannot imagine what else you could possibly be missing from purchasing this remote. It is INCREDIBLE. The setup is easy and thorough. You can customize it beyond what you would imagine. Want your A/V receiver to be turned on after your DVD player? You got it! Want to have the remote say ""Annoy Wife"" when you want to play your Xbox? No problem! Was your DVR infrared receiver blocked by the stack of magazines on the coffee table? It can handle that. You just ask for help and it walks you through a few yes/no questions and BINGO the planets are back in alignment.GET THIS REMOTE! Heck, they even included a new set of batteries to replace the Duracells that it had in it when it shiped. Genius!"
5,"I ask, it does!","I have two 550's and they are outstanding. They run both systems and one has some really old components and work like a charm. I had one item not where I wanted it, so I call Customer service and they set it up exactly as i wanted in a matter of minutes. Outstanding Logitech service. Take your time programing and be sure of your connections and it's money."
5,Logitech Harmony 550 Universal Remote,"I love this remote. I use it for my bedroom setup. I have a Panasonic Plasma TV, Denon Receiver, Denon DVD player and a Comcast cable box. It works flawlessly with all components. It was very easy to set up. I love the way Logitech's web site works. Only answer a few questions, download and your done. I got this remote mostly for my wife to use. She loves it. Just push a button and everything she wants turns on... no hunting around for that third remote. We liked this one so much we bought Logitech's Harmony One for our Home Theater system. I can't say enough about this product. I recommend this product to anyone who has A/V equipment."
5,Just as advertised,"This remote does exactly what it says it does. One thing I would recommend before purchasing it would be to download and install the software from the Logitech website to be sure there are no compatibility issues. If the software installs correctly, then make your purchase.You don't need to be a rocket scientist to set this thing up either. The remote programmed flawlessly although I had to rename an A/V receiver input to enable audio to work correctly from my satellite receiver. That being said, the remote updated quickly. I would highly recommend this remote."
4,harmony remote simplifies media enjoyment,We found the remote easy to program and easy to use. It is great to only have to keep one remote on the table and the unit itself is compact and attractive.
3,Pretty Good Device...Terrible software,This is a great remote but the software crapped out after 2 weeks. This remote requires tweaking to get it just right which is ok if you like technology. The problem is that the software is web based and Logitech's servers went down. At least that is what their customer service said when I called. They didn't announce the problem or offer a resolution. After researching it I found a forum of Logitech Harmony customers complining since March 3rd. The customer service rep said the server has been down since then and they were working on it. They don't know when it will be fixed. It's still not working on March 29th. Really terrible.
2,Bad ergonomics; requires too much DIY programming,"Problem 1: The 550 doesn't fit an adult hand and the keys are too small and awkward to operate. Its uncomfortable to use.Problem 2: The claims of a wide range of units supported is greatly exagerrated. The mfr's database didn't even have a command program for my common Sony DVD carousel, and its proven a real pain in the you-know-what to try to program. Same applies to my Pioneer TV; only the most basic commands are in the database; others must be manually programmed.Problem 3:There are no generic instructions on how to program the remote so one can understand the process; its 100% step-by-step and trial-and error.This is a big disappointment since I thought it would solve the multiple remote issues. It's going back."
1,don't ever buy this remote,"I have now gone through 3 of these remotes in the last three weeks, and so far I was able to get the first one to work for about a week. The remote then decided to just keep saying ""usb connected"". It would not do anthing else.. After 12 hrs of tech support (which by the way half of that time was spent on hold), it was decided that I should just start over with a new remote... From that point on, we couldn't get a remote to connect to the logitech website. Three remotes later... I have given up. I will never buy another logitech remote EVER AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Don't waste your time... believe me... I have wasted enough time for all of you!!!!!!!!"
1,"overly complex, programming takes almost a day",I programmed this remote three times. Each time it would work some functions and mess up others ... I could never get it quite right and I am extremely computer/tech savvy. As an example... it would insist on programming the TV to turn on when all I wanted to do was to listen to the CD player. The wizard based programming interface is really a mess and will require you to press buttons three times if you want to delete an item. Documentation is so poor that you end up trying different options and selections just to get to the feature that needs correcting. You can easily spend half a day programming the Harmony - time not well spent.
1,Do not buy this unless...,"After verifying that it would work with my equipment on Logitech's website, I bought it and sure enough, it really did not work with 2 of the 3 that I had. Many hours later, I finally got it manually programmed well enough to make use of it. 5 minutes later, it crashed. So if you are lucky enough to have equipment that it works with first time out, then lucky you. If not, then you will likely throw the thing against the wall like I did. It was rugged enough to take the hit, so instead, I had to bend it in half, thoroughly completing its destruction with my bare hands before chucking it back in the box, while hooting in sadistic glee.One final thought: What kind of idiocy is it that allowed them to write software for programming the remote that must have internet access to work at all? I can see updates done this way, or occasionally uploading the settings for safe keeping, but that is about the limit. This is just too stupid for words."
4,550 Harmony remote,"I recieved the 550 about a month ago and so far have no problems withit or what it says it can do.I can only say that I`m not sorry I gotthis product,just wished I should have gotten it sooner."
5,Perfect,"To get to the point. This is the only universal remote that I have every used that does EVERYTHING the original remote can do. With the software that comes with it, you can program this thing to do whatever you want. Getting this thing programmed and running was a breeze and once I got the hang of all the featured, I was off and running.Great product."
4,Great Controle,"This is a very nice controle. Good design with a smarter look than the more expensive models. You will most likely run into a few snags when programing this remote with your computer but fear NOT. Logitech's support is second to none at least in reference to this product any way. Even if you have some special needs tech support can customize your remote for you. All you need do is plug it into your computer, call tech support, tell them your problem, wait a minute and hit the update button. Dont forget to tell them thank you for making your life so easy."
4,"Good Remote, takes getting used to.","Been using the remote for the past 5 months. Easy to setup with the web based application provided in the box. Excellent database of equipment and it contained all the equipment I was using in my second home theater in the basement that includes a 10 year old 32"" Sony upright Consul TV. Setup only took 15 minutes including loading the software on the computer. You can program it without the computer but I would guess you would spend all night doing so. It takes a little getting use to using like any other remote and you will find the activities macros like ""Watch TV"" or ""Watch a DVD"" are a great feature simplifying its use. The slim line profile makes the remote easy to handle. This is good intermediate remote but I wouldn't recommend it for the high end home theater."
5,LOGITECH HARMONY 550 REMOTE,"I've had it now about 6 weeks. Had a small glitch with online programming, but the people at Logitech walked me though it fine. They were willing to spend any time needed with me on the phone. The Harmony 550 has been excellent in what it does. I previously had probs getting my surround, HDTV and DVD player to work together, but the 550 does it without a flaw. One button, and all is on and ready-to-go. Only complaint I have is the buttons can be larger. People with weaker eyesight will have problems, but you do get used to the positions with daily use. Liked the value so much that I gave one to my son for Christmas.Highly recommend the Harmony 550 !!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Best all-in-one remote ever! And easy to set up!,"Some say that the 550 is hard to set up of you don't know what you are doing. Well, if you need this remote, you should know what your doing. The software is a breeze to install on both Win and Mac. You just tell the computer what model # each cable box or TV is and it downloads the information onto your TV. Then is asks you NON-technical questions about what you want to do and it does the hard part of setting everything up.One you have it all done and you try to turn on the TV, it asks you questions to make sure everything is running as smoth as posible (right on the remote).Once thats done, its one button. (Watch TV) or (Play DVD). and when you want to change the volume on your receiver, just hit volume. And some remotes have extras spesific to that device, (like sound enhancements), this remote displays that option on the LCD screen of the remote.This is the only remote you will need. It is truly an all in one."
1,Cumbersome and painful,"I have suffered with this remote for the past year. The idea is nice that all buttons can be configured, but I really hate the following:-When switching between Activities the remote toggles the power on all of the devices within that activity. For example, switching between ""Watch DVD"" and ""Watch Cable"", the television switches off, and the remote is in the ""Watch Cable"" activity - which generally does not have an individual TV power on. So, using the activities button did not work for me.-The software is very regimented, such that you must go through their way of programming.-One positive thing is there are active forums which help when you encounter issues.I gave up and put all of the common devices in my main activity, so I don't switch between activities. I would not purchase this remote again."
5,works like a dream,"I set up a mini-home theater with a panasonic digital projector, sony dvd and onkyo 7.1 amp/rec. Surprisingly, none of these remotes allowed use in the dark. The Harmony 550 works perfectly for what we wanted. Using the computer to program how I want to use it was intuitive and very simple. Programing allows for one-touch turn-on of all devices for a particular activity, like watching a movie via the projector or even playing x-box on the big screen. Of course all essential functions for a particular activity can be easily controlled with the Harmony....and especially in the dark. The promotional info is accurate so get the details from there. In short I am very pleased with this purchase."
2,Not built to last,"I've had this remote for about two years now. It works great and does everything I need it to. However, the channel and volume buttons have gotten very difficult to press. These same buttons will also occasionally stick. The printed numbers on the number pad have almost entirely worn off.I'm having a very hard time convincing myself to purchase another Logitech remote."
3,A great device marred by construction quality issues,"Everything about this device is great: Programmability: Super easy, battery life: great, button layout: moderate (until you get used to it). But...Buttons began to not work after only a couple of years in operation. Considering what I paid for it (I think it was around $200 when it first came out) I am not impressed by that fact. I am now shopping for a replacement. I sure hope the successor model is built better."
2,Beware of very small buttons,This is my second Logitech remote. The first one finally wore out and I wanted to save a little money and so chose the Harmony 550. While this remote has the same wonderful programming features of the more expensive units it was for me difficult to use and finally relegated to the end table drawer. If you are used to manipulating your remote by feel then this not the remote for you. The flush buttons are impossible to press without looking and then they are very small.
4,good but not perfect,"the product is excellent as a data storage device, but not a backup alternative. it failed to restore all after a full reset of the hanspring. a system error appeared after installing the card into the springboard module and had to be reset. i guess i have to buy the backup card for more $$$."
5,A True Gem and Classic,"This cd was the very first blues cd I bought back in 1992. It was when I first started really listening and buying Blues music although unknown to me I had been listening to the Blues in Rock music for years. I bought this cd for a friend because out of my 2,000 cds this cd still is one of the best blues cds I own. I won't go into all of the great artists on the cd but will say if your going to buy this be sure to buy this edition as it's a double lp and the other version out there is missing some of the songs and they are worthy.You won't go wrong with this purchase.. my favorite is BB King ""Outside Help"" and Cleanhead Vinson songs.. purely classic. I have found that over the years, blues of this nature is a lost art. Therefore, having this cd is the best you are going to get to being there. And hearing Big Mama Thorton belt out ""Little Red Rooster"" it's sure to make you sing, ""Cock A Doodle Doo"", or in the words of Big Mama.. ""Yahoooooo"". Enjoy!"
4,Just Gives You GOOS Bumps LOL.,"Hey everyone at amazon.com. The Goo Goo Dolls are one of the best bands in the world any album of theres is a plus to your cd collection. Anyway Hold Me Up is one of there earlier albums that still retains there orignal hardcore punk sound from the 80's. This is a big part of the goo goo dolls as some of the tracks verge on what you here now on albums like Dizzy Up The Girl & Gutterflower. Back to the point the best track on this album are 2. Just The Way You Are, 4. There You are. But in fareness the stand out track on this must have album is Two Days In February. In conclusion i hate the people that say goo goo dolls older albums are there best as this is not true there music was good back then but it has evolved so much now the ""Dizzy Up The Girl"" and the ""Gutterflower"" albums are there best to date and the cover version of Supertramps ""Give A Little Bit"" is also cool. Don't hate evolotion!!!!"
4,"Not as good as ""Dizzy""or ""A Boy...""","This CD is a reminder of how the Goo Goo Dolls used to be, a punk rock band; not the band that sings ""Iris"", ""Slide"", or ""Name"", but the band that does songs like ""Long Way Down"" or ""January Friend"". Since the release of this CD, The Dolls have mellowed to be the great band we now know them as. If you like the Dolls don't buy this CD, If you LOVE the Dolls and can't get enough(like me)get this CD as fast as you can!!!"
5,you guys got it all wrong,"this is true balls-out american rock 'n' roll ... not the currently polished ""ready for MTV and the mall"" version of the goo goo dolls most of the reviewers seem to appreciate. the goo goo dolls can go into whatever direction they care to but this is the album that got them close to the replacements and husker du."
1,Bleahh,"Goo Goos make that song ""Million Miles Away"" -- and every othersong -- sound like some sloppy, drunken toss-off that was barelyrehearsed. Why must these modern bands insist on taking classic songs and playing them as though through a blender, completely trashing them? Is this cool? Or better yet, is this TALENT? Yes, I know the Goo Goos can also write their own songs....sort of. At least they *try* to write their own songs, I'll give them that, although it is, at best, just above the level of trained monkeys trying to write their own songs. The results are about the same."
3,I recomend trying other Goo Goo Dolls albums,"I'm a huge fan of The Goo Goo Dolls, but compared to Superstar Carwash, A boy named Goo, and Dizzy up the Girl this album just doesnt do it for me. Its more screaming then singing, the lyrics are tough to comprehend and the music/beat of their songs just isnt up to snuff. Check out the other albums though, their awesome."
2,Try newer albums instead,"I bought this one after falling in love with ""Dizzy up the Girl"" and ""A Boy Named Goo."" Nothing really stands out on this album. Bassist Robby does most the singing and writing which is a shame. Johnny's songs, however, show his amazing gift for lyrics. Most of the songs are really heavy and not at all like those on Dizzy. The only song that really stands out is ""2 Days in February."" Great hint of what the Goo Goo Dolls have become. I'd try the newer albums first before going with this one. It was kind of a disappointment to me, being that I fell in love wtih the Goo Goo Dolls based on ""Name,"" ""Lazy Eye,"" and ""Iris."""
5,Excellent Product,This is an excellent product. We took a 3 foot pile of DVD's in their hard cases and reduced them to 2 DVD cases!
3,REMEMBER TO PURCHASE A MANDREL ALSO!!!!!,Product is good but I didn't know I had to also purchase a mandrel to attach it to my drill. What a headache trying to find one locally so I could use this product.
1,Does not work right out of the box,You need to buy a mandrel to go with this hole saw.There is no warning in the product description.Learn from my mistake.
4,Psychoanalysis meets 9/11,"In my opinion,Zizek is the most profound cultural analyst writing today, and this short collection of several contemplative essays on 9/11 succeeds in truly saying something new and important about the scope of the events that transpired. Zizek's writing style is famous for achieving a mixture between abstruse, Lacanian psycho-analysis and popular culture. This makes him perhaps one of the most difficult but most enjoyable reads out there in the cultural criticism market. Certainly, this stands out from the the sentimental fluff and proganda rubbish that flies off the shelves. Zizek challenges us to think outside the canard of 'fundamentalism' vs. American hegemony and capitalism."
4,Endearing and enjoyable,"As a mother, and author of a book for mothers (NEW PSALMS FOR NEW MOMS: A KEEPSAKE JOURNAL), I just wanted to give the main character Katie, and her abused sister, a big hug. This touching tale is a good reminder that we all need to be aware of abused children and not just look the other way. Let's all strive to cherish our ALL of our children."
5,story of a motherless family,"These 2 teenage girls lost their mother and are both in search of a way to fill that void in completely different ways. They have a tough, military dad that truely loves them and is trying to raise them the best he knows how EXCEPT ----the only way he knows how to raise them is by example of his childhood, which was apparently abusive. I lost my mother to cancer when I was 8, and this book really touched my heart.I remember laying in my bed at night and ""talking"" to my mother and also thinking she wasn't really dead and she'd be back and also be upset that God could let that happen. My father was very kind but he also would not speak a word about my mother. Very good story and an easy book to read and understand the characters."
3,mediocre,"If you want a synopsis of the novel, you can read the other reviews or the summary above.I felt this novel was mediocre. It lacked any deep thought provocations. I feel as though books that I read in primary school had deeper emotional ties. ""A Bridge to Tarabithia"" or ""A Taste of Blackberries"" both had what I feel draws a reader into the story at a much deeper level.It was a light easy read. Not all bad! Just, lacking in something that I was looking for."
2,meandering and plotless,i was disappointed after this book was suggested to me. nothing ever happens. there are a lot of long winded descriptions and background and very little story.
4,I'm sold on this series...,"Katie is quite lovable and in a difficult situation with her abusive father, her confused adolescent sister, and memories of her mom who recently died. She is struggling through early adolescents and trying to make sense of her chaotic and stressful world. It's a hard book to put down because you want to know where Katie is, if she's alright, and where the book may lead you next. I understand this is the first of several books with Katie as the central character, and I'm signing on for the next edition."
5,Well worth the read,"This is just an extraordinarily written, keenly sensitive book written from the point of view of Katie, a 12 year old girl growing up on a military base in Texas who has lost her mother to cancer and whose father is an Army officer who slaps Katie and her sister around when he feels he cannot control them. The book is all about how Katie copes with her father's unpredictable anger, her impending womanhood, and no mother to nurture her -- and it is excellent. I highly, highly recommend this book. What a pleasure....thank you, Ms. Berg!"
3,I'm glad that Berg wrote more books...,"This was her first, I believe, and I read it last, then it's sequels.I'm glad that Berg wrote more books and I am glad that I read them first because had I read Durable Goods first, I would not have known one of my favorite author's work. I only read the sequels out of respect for Ms. Berg because I love so many of her other books.The book is not a coming-of-age book. It is a betrayal of military dads everywhere, making the girls verbally and emotionally (and sometimes physically) abusive father seem like a military norm. It's a quick read because there isn't much there - literally and figuratively.If you are thinking about reading her, please start with something high caliber, like The Year of Pleasures."
3,Not my fav,"I wasn't crazy about this book. It wasn't bad, it just wasn't my cup of tea. It read almost like a journal (in Katie's voice) and dealt with her problems of her mother's death, her abuse by her father, her first period and first kiss, and her sister running away, among others. I put this book in the same category as _Seventeeth Summer_ by Maureen Daly. To me, it was boring and slow and little character developement."
2,Mildly Entertaining,"I fell in love with Berg's writings through ""Pull of the Moon"" and ""Talk Before Sleep"" and couldn't get enough of her writings. Well, I read ""Durable Goods"" and found that adolescence wasn't a connecting point for me. I think Berg's strength is in describing and conveying being a woman. This book was a miss."
4,violence and love,"This book, written by the author of ""Talk Before Sleep"" skillfully combines the feeling of hope and despair, love and loathing. Through all of the trials of our young protagonist, there is a theme of the friendship of other women, and sisterhood, both literally and figuratively. There is also the subtle message that the perpetrator of violence is as much to be pitied as the victim(s). This book provides delightful characterization of the female set. It will set you up for the next book, ""The Joy School"". Both books are well worth your time"
2,boring,"This book was extremely short, relying on large type and large margins to fill the book. It was devoid of any real plot and left me with a bitter taste. It was typical of ""Oprah Book Club"" books in that it is very depressing. I think this could have been a great book had the author expanded on the topics and built out the characters more fully. You did get a sense of the main character, but with such a short book, the rest were very weak."
1,It'd be ok if they knew how to ship.,"The cabinet is nothing special, but thats what you get when you pay 1/5 the cost of others, and thats what I was expecting. The problem is that the company shipping these things has no idea how to package something for shipping. The package is a single walled cardboard box which doesn't hold up in shipping. They are after all shipping large pieces of metal. My box had holes in it which was not good given the small screws which float around in the box. Some small parts were missing and the metal parts of the cabinet had the corners bent. Much worse than any description I read here and missing parts really pissed me off. I was expecting low quality, but not missing parts."
1,Who know's? I never got it.,"I ordered this item and was told it was backordered for a few days even though they charged my credit card the same day I ordered it. Then they sent me an email telling me that it would be a few more days. A few days go by and no contact of any kind. I email them to find out what is going on and they say that it will be another 3 weeks from that point. I said to cancel and they tell me that its on its way in 3 weeks. I tell them to cancel again and they send me an email telling me to respond within 10 days or they will cancel the order. They charged me the day I ordered, but it takes them forever to refund money for an item they never even came close to sending."
1,Don't buy from this company!!,"I ordered this cabinet as a Christmas present for my husband from Sportsman's guide. Without my authorization they linked my account information, including my email and payment info, to an account previously opened by my husband and put his name and email as the primary contact. They then sent an order conformation to him! So much for as a suprise christmas present. I left a message for a supervisor to call me about my complaint, which was never returned. When I finally did contacted a supervisor they said there was nothing that could be done about their system merging similar accounts together based on addresses. Wow how interesting is that! When I asked to speak to a manager they told me there was none. What kind of service is this? I have canceled my order and will never buy from them again."
1,The content does not match the external description...,"Personally this is a total dissapointment because of the following:1. I was looking for some specific grammar learning tool and thought this was what I needed. However, it also contains math and other unrelated items, a contradiction with respect to the title itself.2. Grammar exercises are poorly prepared. Questions were asked without giving a lesson first. Answers to questions are brief and unsatisfactory, and often with no examples whatsoever.3. There was supposed to be a TV show or some sort of video according to the box, there is no such thing when you actually run the program -> more contradictions.4. There is some annoying and irrelevant game, totally unrelated to the objective of grammar learning.To summarize the title of the CD-ROM does not reflect the contents at all, it is inconsistent and full of contradiction. I got so angry at the end that I returned it... waste of time and money :("
1,Do not waste your money,"Do not buy the book. It will waste your money, at the end you will get very angry. It does not teach you at all."
2,Ouch,"I've had great luck with Florsheim shoes over the years, but I find these shoes to be some of the more uncomfortable that I own. They feel like they run small, and I thought they might ""give"" a little, but they haven't. They also continue to squeak when I walk, after several weeks of wear. I only wear these now when I'm going to be in them for a short time, not all day."
1,Squeak squeak,"I have always worn florsheim shoes. Last year I bought 3 different pair. I am only writing on these because they are the loudest. I am so embarrassed to wear them. Sore feet and squeaking has always been the norm the first couple of weeks, then like magic they would become the perfect fit. Now people hear me coming from so far away. I have soaked them in liquid oil and finally went to saddle soap. Stretching only made this pair worse. My other pairs, courtland and lexington also too loud to wear to work. Disposable..."
3,Only ONE Sham,This is the first time I have purchased beddings online so I probably missed the information notifying me that the packet included only ONE sham. I was expecting that there would be 2 of them in the packet and was a little dissapointed to find that I had ordered a single white sham.Otherwise the product was good.
2,"Low quality, low price","I read many positive reviews on these sheets and shams, so I decided to give them a try. They are indeed sheets. I am giving the company the benefit of the doubt and will accept the premise that they are flannel. As far as the quality goes, one wash and they already began to pill, as did the matching duvet cover. The pilling has increased with each washing. These are not sheets you would want to put out for guests--they look worn and somewhat skanky even when they are just out of the dryer. They feel somewhat stiff but not hair spray crispy--certainly not baby soft flannel. For the price, I probably shouldn't have expected much better. For $50, I have a duvet cover, pillowcases and one sheet set. I would not buy from this brand again, even with the low price for the set. Pretty crap overall"
3,Okay pillow shams,"These are okay pillow shams. Def warm, I've gotten a lot of compliments on them, but I'm very particular and prefer a more satin-like material."
5,Very satisfied.,I bought this product as a Christmas gift for my mother-in-law. The color was great and the look and feel was exactly as expected. Very soft. I was nervous ordering these sight unseen but she loved them.
3,Ok for true beginners to the craft...,"If you are totally new to writing and have never read more than 10 articles on the craft of writing before...then this is for you.For someone more read on the subject I only found 7 of the 42 articles worthy to keep as references/checklists to use as I'm actually doing my writing.Try and get this book at the library or a used bookstore or ebay. Don't pay full price. Everyone will get something different from it, maybe you will get more out of it than I did."
4,This is actually Volume II in the two-part series,"1) Very similar to my comments on Volume 1 = totally for novices and those brand spanking new to reading articles on the craft of writing2) I found 8 of the 33 articles to be VERY well done and useful as future references/checklists as I do my writing3) Overall I liked the quality of the articles in Vol II more so than Vol I4) A lot of the information in these articles/advice will cirulcate back through your subscription to Writer's Digest Magazine. Meaning you can get a subscription or get this book at the library, ebay, or used book store."
4,Not the typical amnesia story,"I've read thousands of romance novels and I love to run across one that has some kind of twist that sets it apart from all the others. This isn't your run-of-the-mill amnesia story. Not only does the heroine not remember anything, but she and the hero are pretty sure that she's married to his brother. Regaining her memory really doesn't solve their problems.It's a sweet story, and not really a light, humorous one, so if that's what you're looking for, you may want to look elsewhere."
1,"FALSE ADVERTISING, PRESENTATION","This adapter is a 1/8"" to 1/4"" adapter as is STATED clearly on the product packaging now that it arrived *** IT IS NOT A 1/4"" TO 1/8"" ADAPTER AS IS ADVERTISED HERE. Plugging in a 1/8 mini headphone the 1/8"" adapts to the larger 1/4"" plug. Since this is advertised as plugging into a 1/4"" plug and changing into a 1/8"" mini plug, that is what I needed! Now, I have to bother to print, return, etc. I already have a 1/8"" to 1/4"" adapter for 27 cents. Why would I spend $6.24 for the same darn thing!!! Maybe that is why they reversed the sizes!"
5,Good product,I have purchased lesser quality head phone adapters and been sorry. I picked the Planet Waves brand for its value and recommendations. It seems to be well made and functions well. Both ends are tight fitting for the head phones and the 1/4in male end that fits into the AVR. I would recommend this stereo adapter to any one.
1,Wrong pump!!!,This module when order stated it was for everywhere EXCEPT Cali which means it should have had the tank pressure sensor in the top. It does not even have a spot for it! The description leaves out the detail that you have to cut your old connector off of the harness and wire in a new one. Since I have to have my truck by morning looks like I have to try and make junk work. Thanks Amazon! NOT!
3,Some interesting short stories,"But I found some of the art was reused from his other books. Still, there was some interesting stories but I found ""Great Space Battles"" a better book."
3,Wrong size stated under Product Features,"B003D6CY0W says ""Two-piece 9'0"" rod"" in the heading, but ""Agility Two-piece 6'0"" rod "" in the product description. So, is it 9'0"" or 6'0""? Please correct. What more can I say? Is that enough words?"
3,it's okay,Good variety. Doesn't work for me really well since my workout room is in my basement. The low ceiling keeps me from being able to get the max from a lot of the overhead moves.
1,Terrible,"If you are a person who works out on a regular basis this is probably not the video for you. It reminded me of Jane Fonda.It is also hard to follow- she chages moves after only about 4 reps. I've done Insanity, Tapout XT and P90X so this was not challenging at all."
1,Slide scanner,"I was trying to buy a slide scanner, which (as it turns out) was an attachment or feature of another larger scanner (or printer)? It didn't look exactly like this. The problem was that its connections (plugs) were so outdated, they couldn't plug into any other equipment I had. Even HP wasn't able to help me because they no longer make it. It may have been the wrong piece of equipment. Or perhaps I was sent an older one. But check with HP before buying to be sure it's a currently supported item."
5,Early Hank Aaron,The information provided prior to purchase was accurate and sufficient. The product is a great book describing the early days of the great Hank Aaron. A superior product that every baseball fan should consider adding to their collection.
5,I WISH I COULD PURCHASE IT ON AMAZON!,"THE CD IS TIGHT. IT'S ALL DAT. THIS CD IS ONE OF THOSE YOU BUMP IN YOUR RIDE WHEN YOU HANGN' OUT AND CHILLN' WITH YOUR PEOPLES. IT'S MELLOW AND CALM. ONE OF MY FAVORITE SONG ON THE CD IS ""12 PACADOJA"". MAN I LOVE THAT CD, AND I REALLY WISH I COULD PURCHASE IT ON AMAZON, OR ANY OTHER RECORD STORE. I GUESS THIS CD IS TO REAL FOR THE STORES."
5,^^ that really was a helpful review,"When I heard about this one, I had the luck that soon as I started searchin' it, I found it. And now it's in my collection. I really liked this one, Lil HD had some nice lyrics, and the production is classic. Damn, I just have to get the Mass 187 - Real Trues Paying Dues..."
3,I liked some songs others did not like,"Got the album when it came out and didn't immediately go for it. What I really liked about the album was the song eastside, westside what a song, I use to play that song and just enjoy the bass lines on it. There is also a good mix with no rapping that I enjoyed. There is a funny interlude almost comic skit that is comparable to the Dove Shack's."
4,blue crystal protective phone cover,I liked the color but the very first day I had it I dropped the phone and cracked the cover. So I didn't get to use it very long.
5,Brilliant movie!!!!,"Very good movie, every time I have seen it, it made me think for weeks - highly recommended."
4,"Also another film on it - two for one, you for two","If you want see this film, you will have to see another film on ""Kaspar Hauser"". The director is Peter Sehr. It's really wonderful. Also this film tells about inner development and purity facing to violence and perversion. When I have seen it, it made me feel a deep, warm understanding - strongly recommended."
1,Not what I thought it would be,"I was looking for a movie in German, it was advertised, on the cover it states as the language - German it is in English"
4,Loved the product HATED the Packaging,I like the product However the packaging SUCKS! It Horrible accessing the product and have boodied my hans trying to get it open. Sheesh People!!
5,Every woman I know loves this scent,"I have been using this cologne for 25 years and never met a woman that didn't love it. The last 3.4 bottle I bought was for $40, I'm having trouble understanding why it's now $189. It's always been my fragrance and I hate to change but I will seriously need to consider that price tag. It's a shame, but maybe the upside is not every guy will be wearing it."
1,compilation albums are EVIL!,"This is a pretty tacky way to cash in on this mini-series, but if people will buy it, whatever..."
2,Where's Jimi Hendrix?,"Although I did not personally live through the 60's, I do listen to the oldies station. I personally think that some of these tunes are darn tacky (i.e. ""My Boyfriend's Back""). And where's Jimi Hendrix, the star of Woodstock? And what about the Doors?"
2,Whoops! They forgot to put the good music in it!,"If I had checked the songs out before buying, I never would have gotten it. Thank you Amazon, for the 30 day money back guarantee. Unopened it will go back. Why not the songs from the movie?"
1,Excuse me?,"Here we have the soundtack to a movie about the 60's. Supposedly this is ""classic stuff."" But you'll notice the absence of anything by 1) The Beatles 2) The Stones 3) The Byrds 4) Joan Baez 5) Jimi Hendrix 6) The Kinks....the list can go on. Even the lone Dylan track is a new one."
1,GIVE IT A REST!!!!,"While there is some good music on this CD, the bottom line is to give the 60s a rest. They are over and have been over. I mean we are just pulling out of the 70s all over again with the 80s hot on its tail. Next thing you know, grunge will be back in style. Good God. What happened to originality? Or has it ever existed?What does this have to do with the music? Not much I suppose. Put it in your vault and play it for your kids in twenty years, nostalgically."
2,Throw away the key.,"I haven't bought this CD, and I probably won't, now that I know what's on it. I did watch the 2 part show on NBC,(this week actually). And this soundtrack kinda ticks me off. It looks like they went with the more user friendly tracks aimed at the folks who actually grew up in the 60's, rather than target today's generation like I thought the film did. No Velvet Underground on this CD and there were 2 songs by them in the movie! Nope this reeks of a bad K-Tel tape. 2 stars for this one, just because that Temptations movie got My Girl on a kick."
2,My New List,If you liked my other list of songs. I aded some more songs to the list.-The Beatles-While My Guitar Gently Weeps -Neil Young-Down By the River -Jimi Hendrix-The Star Spangled Banner -The Turtles-Happy Together -The Grateful Dead-Truckin' -The Four Seasons-Big Girls Don't Cry -The Beach Boys-Surfin' U.S.A. -The Allman Brothers Band-Ramblin' Man -Ben E. King-Stand By Me -The Champs-Tequila -Litte Eva-Loco-Motion
4,'The '60's:Original NBC Motion Picture Soundtrack'(Polygram),"Loved the 3 1/2 hour made-for-TV movie as I just couldn't wait to lay my mitts on the soundtrack disc.Although it COULD have included a couple of MORE key songs from the era.There are several tunes on this fifteen track offering that I hadn't heard in years.Like Marvin Gaye's ""Could I Get A Witness?""(one of the BEST Motown songs ever),Bob Dylan's ""Chimes Of Freedom"" and The Animal's ""Winds Of Change"".A few that I'll always hold close to my heart are Jefferson Airplane's ""Somebody To Love"" and Cream's ""Sunshine Of your Love"".Nice."
2,All the good songs are gone!,"Having watched the 4 hours of the stereotypical view of the sixties...all kids are either draft dodger radicals or gung-ho GIs....I was surprised at how diverse the soundtrack was in the movie. But unfortunately they didn't put the real gems on the CD. ""For What It's Worth"" by Buffalo Springfield alone would have been worth the price of the disc, but no, we get ""My Boyfriend's Back"" trotted out once more. And what about any British music for God's sake? The Beatles one appearance from the landmark appearance on the 2/9/64 show is the only hint that there was music made anywhere but the good old U.S.A. So much for a truthful representation of either the era or the music. By the way, I lived through the sixties."
1,Not representative of the movie; a big disappointment.,"To run a four-hour miniseries and then offer a cd which is supposed to adequately represent the mini series, should require a two-disc set of the major music from that movie. This collection does not fill that bill. Some of the music on this cd is only there to satisfy certain demographics and does not do justice to the miniseries...nor to the period it pretends to represent. What a huge disappointment; it could have been so much more... Obviously, somebody just wanted to make a buck and didn't care about the people who count the most: the customers."
2,Based on the play list and my life in the sixties....,"Hey, Amazon.com , I want to buy James Leno's Sixties CD! So when do you think you'll have it available? My 46th birthday is February 17th, so place a rush on production, ok? My two stars are based on your play list.....debating whether I want the same old, same old....."
1,If I had listened to the cd first I would not have bought it,I liked the music in the movie (although the movie itself was way too Hollywood) and was expecting the same music on the cd. Unfortunately much of the music in the movie was not on the cd and it should not be advertised as a sound track of the movie. The music that they did choose to put on the cd did not capture the spirit of the movie or the spirit of the time period. I was taken in by a big marketing hype.
3,"Well thought out, but missing more","As was said below, I think that this CD is missing some of the great songs that highlighted the decade. Although I may only be 14, I think most (maybe all) of the music I've heard from the 60s is better than what we have today. I agree, we need more beatles, but not everything could be compiled on one disc. I think this disc would be a great thing for people to explore with. If they saw the show, and wanted to hear more, they should get this disc. It may lead them to other albums from that time, and expand their music appreciation as a whole"
3,Nothing THAT impressive,"I've studied modern music in all its forms for a long while now. Especially the 60s. I've got my share of 60s soundtracks, too. This is not one that I'll be adding to my collection soon, because (1) We've all heard these songs on some form of 60s compilation album before, (2) You kinda predict what's gonna be on the album before you see the series on the tube and (3) it's just second nature to put the Beach Boys on a 60s compilation. But this CD does have its good points. However overplayed or prdictable, it's good to see James Brown and Graham Nash on the same CD. Gives a good balance. And you gotta have The Band with ""The Weight"", it's a pure classic. So, on the whole, this is one of those middle-of-the-road kinda of 60s soundtracks. They could've done better. Like ""I'm a Man"" by the Spencer Davis Group or ""Pictures of Matchstick Men"" by Status Quo. If NBC does another one of these things I hope they take these ideas into consideration."
1,"Turn, Turn, Turned Me Off","This CD is a huge disappointment! Why did they put crap on it and no Jimmy Hendrix or Bob Dylan, aside from his duet with Joan Osborn, which, in my oppinion, stinks. I am so glad I looked at the artists before I bought this sucker."
1,Where's the rest????,"COME ON! I know for starters that this is next to the worst of all the 60's compilations ever released. Although I think that the American Graffiti is the one that falls shortest. At 4 tracks! This was very dissapointing. I must admit though, the songs are good. But too many are the ones you hear twice to four times a day on the local oldies radio station. This falls waaaay short."
3,This isn't a sound track...,"This isn't a soundtrack... Honestly, I don't know what it is. It does have several good songs on it, but it didn't even scratch the surface of the amount of songs the miniseries had. Though I like ""Chicago / Change The World"", and some of the others, I was really disapointed that ""For What It's Worth"" by Buffalo Springfield wasn't included. Anyway, if you haven't seen the movie, you may not mind the lack of 3/4 the songs, but it truly is a lacking CD..."
2,Unbelievably INcomplete!,"""Nature's Way"" in the movie was really great! Why couldn't it be on the sountrack?!??! But now am trying to identify one song: In the movie it was pretty much of a flute instrumental, slow and hynotic, and then there are some male vocals briefly ""I saw you come back to me...."" Thanks for your help! If you know what I'm talking about, write a review here again..."
3,Not bad for a TV Movie Soundtrack,"The track listing for ""The 60's"" is a pretty fair representation of the incredibly vast and varied styles of pop/rock music that evolved during the decade. In response to ""A music fan from Connecticut"", with all due respect, Polygram might have chosen not to pay the license fees for groups like the Beatles, the Stones and even Bob Dylan, which is probably why Dylan recorded a tune specifically for the series (which, by the way, cannot be found anywhere else but this soundtrack). Over all, for a single CD compilation, it sounds pretty good."
3,"3 Stars at best, barely above 2.","It is obvious that this soundtrack was put together by the same bunch of consultants that provide the play lists containing the same 90 or 100 songs we have to listen to day in and day out from every oldies station in the country. Of all the music that came out in the sixties, it would have been nice if these people had taken the time to dig just a little deeper and find some real gems. Where is Country Joe and the Fish, or Arlo Guthrior even Ray Stevens? As usual, Network TV missed the boat on this one."
1,not to fresh,this cd is like alot of other compilations that try to reflect an era.alot of hits and miss match material.but the 60's was bigger than what is presented here.skip this.
5,terrific,Great condion just s described loved the cd as well a i loved the movie!would love to do business with again!
3,somewhat disappointing,"When watching the movie, so much 60's music is played-that was the reason I ordered the cd. I should have taken the time to see the actual song list. Had I have done that, I wouldn't have ordered the cd, looking for perhaps a more complete compilation of that era's music on Amazon."
5,great :),it view the used dvd i bought ( the 60's)and it impressed me :) i tottaly recommended it !!!
3,"Simple ""It works""",I like thinks That are simple and that work. The only reason I didn't give it more stars is because you have to clean the parts as soon as you spray them. It's not the type of cleaner you can spray and let sit so the cleaner can penetrate. If I had a choice between two different sprays I would pick the penetrating kind.
4,Creepy drama that makes you think....,"The Pre-Row-v-wade 60's horror take on the abortion issue, it still works today. Creepy ex is much like the ex from Fear (Mark Wahlberg) and has the same energy as Scream and Fatal Attraction blended in the late 1960's. A must see if you like to be freeked out without all the gore and use your head..."
2,A Frightening Prequel to Fatal Attraction,"This movie is definitely unnerving, so don't watch it alone. Carol White plays a young woman who meets a handsome young photographer( even in the beginnig he uses sadistic ways to meet her or be around her) who has some mental problems to say the least. When she becomes pregnant he throws her out and she gets an abortion. Months later she meets a wonderful man and after they are married they have a son. Her ex finds out about her and finds a way to manipulate his way back into her life, still resenting the fact that she aborted his baby. He eventually kidnapps the baby with disasterous consequences. I acctually wanted to see this because it was one of Ron Masaks earlier roles. ROn, best know as sheriff Mort Metzger on Murder She Wrote, was reduced to a few seconds on screen with someone else doing a voice-over for him."
5,Great 70's flick,"I remember this movie from when I was in high school and all my friends watched it at a slumber party once. We still remember the suspense and talk about it at reunions today. I'm going to give this tape away as a door prize at our next reunion! It'll be a hit! Sad about the lead actress, Carol White, later in life though. She reminded me of Julie Christie and I figured she had made a similar name for herself oversees. Sadly, she fell into the drug scene of the era and never recovered, I guess. Still, the movie is great and I'm glad it was available!"
4,"A ""Must Read"" for ""disease theory"" advocates!","Stanton Peele does in this book, what Richard Dawkins and Christopher Hitchens did in their recently released books (""The God Delusion"", and ""God Is Not Great""), by exposing the ""disease theory"" for the fraudulent line of ""thinking"" that it is! The book is meticulously researched, and were it more current (2005, vs. 1995), I would have given it 5 stars vs. the 4 I did! I wish more emphasis had been placed on defining the term ""disease"" in the true MEDICAL basis of the word, vs. making the case for how EVERYTHING is a ""disease"", as Peele postulates. The level of research and cited examples make the thesis of the book impossible to argue against. If you are a ""disease theory"" advocate before reading this book, you should not be afterwards!"
3,No Justice for Janet....,"As a huge Janet Jackson fan, I would love to give this film a 5 star review but I can't. I'm giving it three stars simply because SHE is in it! John Singleton's movie ""Boyz in the Hood"" was much better and this one can't decide what it wants to be. The problem is in the story and in the direction and less with the actors. Janet gives a good performance in the movie, as does Tupac Shukar and Regina King. To me, it felt like Singleton sat down, wrote out some ideas and then just threw them all together. If you are a Janet fan, you'll want the dvd. Otherwise, I doubt you'll enjoy it."
2,Disappointing,"The idea behind it is excellent. The film just didn't succeed. Tupac's acting and Maya Angelou's poetry were perhaps the only truly commendable aspects of the film. The plot, in attempting to cover too much ground, becomes muddled and confused, and unfortunately Janet Jackson gave a very lacking performance of the character of Justice (in the theatre, people were laughing as she attempted to act dramatically). Some of the plot was also contrived, and the characters fell pray to the standard stereotypes. Overall, this is a film with a lot of potential, that turned out poorly."
5,The amazing Tupac,"Poetic justice was an o.k film but I love it because tupac was in it. He is so amazing and I hope he brings out more films. ""I believe he's still alive"" at least he is,in my heart."
1,the worst,"movie i have ever seen. No, I'm serious. Corny, stupid and laughable. Anyone who likes this movie is a certified moron. I laughed my ass off at the poetry and i couldn't make it through the whole movie. I'm sure Janet isn't too proud of this moment. At least TUPAC is dead.Please click ""No"" on my review. I like to count how many morons actually respond to my review.Update: I just saw that i was ""dissed"" by a reviewer (Janets man) of ""this kind of movie"" (which in itself is an obvious re-classification for a movie that sucks). I'm glad you know what you're getting. Hey, if whats at the bottom of the trash can look appetizing - don't let me stop you. Geeky movies? - Didn't you review like every Nightmare on Elm Street flick in existence and a bunch of chic music? - That's funny coming from you. didn't know this was a forum for personal attacks. I Love it. Enjoy your ""meal"". haha."
4,This video is straight-up chillin yo!!!,"I would highly suggest that if you haven't seen this, watch it. Tupac is straight up fly in this movie!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,"Not a great movie, but that stars were great","The movie itself wasn't completely well done, it seemed to have a rather cheap production budget. But Janet and Tupac both did great jobs with energetic, charismatic performances that made you care for both of them. Jackson was completely convincing in her debut, facing the challenge of playing a character that many think she wouldn't be able to relate to. She transcended her own self and connected with the emotional core of her character, and Tupac turned in a completely charming performance with surprising depth. I can't wait to see Janet's next movie."
5,the movie that must get true you !,"Well, i must say 2pac is the best rapper actor everything im totaly crazy about him as well as janet those two make you wanna watch it true the end without lieving i'still watch it every now and then im just in love with it .(i wish i could have made a movie with him ...maybe next lifetime!!)"
3,I thoght it was just alright it could been better.,I thought that janet jackson part in the movie didn't really give a strong plot really at all. I felt that Tupac acting was better than Janet and the part with Regins King.If your bored at home it's worth watching if nothing else is on tv. Bring back the 90's feel .
2,Singleton's Women Roles Lacking,"Janet Jackson was the wrong choice for the lead in this film. Ms. Jackson was not believable as a ""home girl"". The other women characters in this film also did not come across well, because Singleton has yet to learn how to deal with them onscreen. The story rambled at times, and a few times, some plot points were not explained. Why did the male stylist in the beauty shop break down after receiving a phone call? The best actor in the whole film was the late Tupac Shakur, who had a natural ability onscreen. Otherwise, this is not Singleton's best effort."
1,SUCKED,"This is the worst movie i have ever seen in my whole life it had story to it no plot. to make matters worse janet jackson cant act i didnt feel it there she just didnt have the spirit of a actress. Tupac on the other hand, did alright i just wished they had givin him a betta script."
1,I wish I could have given it 0 stars,"This is the one of the worst films I have ever seen, second only to ""Showgirls"". I cannot believe that it has averaged four stars! This was a waste of two hours of my life that I will never get back. Save your time and dont even rent it."
3,stick to music miss janet,"I'm a huge fan of janet jackson's music. Her acting is not quite as good as the music and music videos. She and tupac looked good in the movie and janet tried her best, but she was much better on Good Times and Different Strokes as a child. Hopefully she'll give a great performance in the upcoming film she's doing about Lena Horne. It was nice hearing her single ""Again"" in the movie, it's definitely one of her best ballads ever."
3,good for the acting ensemble,"even though the film pales in comparrison to Singlton's previous effort, ""Boyz in the Hood"" the film is still entertaining mainly because of the performance of the four leads. Tupac Shakur, Regina King, Joe Torry, are all very good in splashy showy roles, while Jackson proves herself an actress in a charming performance in an understated role."
3,Poetic Justice,"I was fifteen years old when I first saw this movie when it first came out at the theaters back in the summer of 1993. I liked how the story showed a young black woman healing from the hurt and pain of losing her boyfriend, and how she wrote poetry to help her get through her pain. I thought that the poetry was really good. But the real reason why I give this movie three stars is because there was too much profanity and all the arguing and bickering that went on in the movie. I felt like all of that wasn't necessary for the movie. ""Boyz N The Hood"" will always be the #1 movie from John Singleton."
2,"No plot, just not good.","The acting is pretty much only good thing in this movie. Still i get the feeling that director, John Singleton, hired 2pac and Janet Jackson,just because at that time they were big musicians. So he thought he could make a blockbuster successful movie.However it is great to see 2pac alive again. Still 2pac has also been in better roles such as juice.The plot is weak,the only scene i like is when they crash a family reunion. they do this just get food."
5,Love it,"Everyone is going to have their own opinion and I respect that but to try and degrade the movie is childish. if u didnt like it, thats fine, but there are several movies made that will not appeal to everyone. Poetic Justice is a great movie. Yes there is alot of foul language just like most of singletons movies. The truth is, his characters are depicted as real life characters. Real life people cuss! Basically that is the TRUTH so if the cussing is what offends you then you are living in a fantasy world. But anyway I love the film. I love to see Janet as an outspoken woman instead of the shy person that I always saw. Tupac-job well done. rest in peace.mzlesliej"
4,movie critic,"I believe it showed Tupac and Janet's acting abilities. It depicts the reality of life in the hood. Cons:Could have been a better ending, the whole movies is kind of predictable too."
3,Unforgettable artists in a forgettable flick,"Let's just start with the script, I was in a play written by a fifteen year-old that had a better script than this movie. Now I have to dog out one of the best musical entertainers working today; Janet needs to leave acting alone. She was so bad that I laughed when she was supposed to be serious. All I saw was the singer, Janet Jackson, trying too hard be ghetto in braids. And as much as I love Maya Angelou, I didn't want to hear any poetry while watching this movie. Like the other reviewer had stated, Tupac made up for the bad script. He was the "" diamond in the rock"" in this picture. I miss his extreamly talented acting one hundred times more than I miss his music."
2,great,movie was awesome loved it what i could get from it cause i got it looking perfect but the movie skipped like half way wtf man but i loved what i saw pac was great:)
5,in plenty of time,"I was very impressed it came weeks b efore the earliest date that i would recieve it, and it was new just like the description said! thank you amazon! and seller!"
5,My outdoor kitchen !,I like to cook outdoors and this burner system has completed my outdoor kitchen! Excellent quality. I recommend using cast iron cookware as it is very powerful/hot even on low setting. I haven't cooked inside my house since receiving it.
1,Poor quality and shipping protection,"Ordered stove and it arrived damaged (box beat up, parts hanging out). Returned item and recieved a replacement, it was also damaged. Both stoves had tack welds broken and damage to the base of the stove. At first I thought it was just shipping damage but on closer review it appears that the broken welds and the sheet metal base had been painted at the factory after the damage. So much for quality control. I was really looking forward to using it. Also tried to contact the manufacturer via E Mail and have never received a response.Only good thing about the experience was that Amazon took care of replacing the unit the first time and refunding my money the second time without a hitch."
5,Camp Chef Grill,We bought it for our canning season to have extra burners & it worked out great. Was able to set up in our garage & kept the heat out of the kitchen. Great investment.
4,Light and Listenable,"Here's another of those disks that just showed up in my mailbox one day from a label I've never heard of, featuring musicians that for the most part I've never heard of, but turning out to be sonically and musically a really enjoyable recording. Brazilian Nights was produced by acoustic guitarist Jack Jezzro, who also wrote all the tunes except one. His supporting musicians include Pat Coil (the one musician I had previously heard of) on keyboards, Craig Nelson on acoustic and electric bass, Eric Darken and Glen Caruba on percussion, with appearances by George Tidwell on flugelhorn and Denis Solee on flute. The music is light and listenable, but not offputtingly ""lite,"" with a nice Brazilian feel to it. The recording is vivid, with plenty of bass energy."
5,I find this book quite factual and edifying.,"If you find Egyptology fascinating, as I do you will find that much of this book discusses King Tut's tomb and the significance of what was discovered and what was covered-up or deliberately misidentified. The link between Freemasons and Egyptology are explained. As an amateur historian I find this book quite factual and edifying. As an engineer by trade, I find the author's knowledge of science and math to be superb. As a writer and information presenter, I find the author's material highly readable and significantly interesting. I also recommend another controversial best seller, `Alien Rapture' by Edgar Fouche. `Unconventional Flying Objects' by Paul Hill is another page turner to check out."
3,Interesting but far fetched!,"The Ideal of a race of super gods Imparting wisdom on mankind Is a Interesting theory and on that I would reconmend this book.The thing that bothers me Is his theory on what happens when we die.You see,I believe that pain and joy Is a part of this life,but hell In this world Is caused by what man does to oneanother not god.If we are bought back then why erase our memories of our past life since this Is what will help us on our journey toward perfection.We learn from our experiences and If In one life we suffer and gain compassion and In the next life we become 'better off' without memory of the last life,what Is to keep us from falling back Into the same state that we have risen from?God dosen't send us through hell and heaven,we send each other through It.If man does not learn how to treat his brother/sister better and learn to share(which Is what true message of hope should be)the coming destruction will be caused by his own hands."
5,A MUST for a GameBoy Advance,"This is a very good GameBoy Advance light. I would recommend buying this instead of using the old GameBoy Color light. The GBC light you will have to twist 180 degrees otherwise it will light up the back of your GBA. Also, it the connection for a GBC was very loose and wouldn't stay put. It would always flicker. With this, there is a ""clip"" to insure the light stays in. Also, it is secure even without the clip. And to add some more sugar to this Warhead, it has a pass-thru connector. This allows you to have a light as well as a link cable hooked up at the same time."
3,It could be better.,"Well, I think that it could be VERY BETTER. The light is ""blue"" (when it should be white) and it ""reflect/contemplate""* in GBA's screen. It's good if you use it to play in a place very dark. If you need play in a place middle dark, it's not good.* : I don't know wich use. I'm not american. Sorry by my english."
5,Don't listen to these babblers!,"The Nyko Wormlight Advance is a very inexpensive solution to the Gameboy Advance's almost nonexistent backlighting problem. Sure, a ton of light comes out, and sure, if you don't adjust the light it will be right in the middle of the screen. But that's why they made it flexible! All I had to do was move the light to the right a little bit, and it worked just fine. There was some glare on the screen, but is was on the black part. This product really brings out GBA's brilliant true colors. Buy it!"
1,Doesn't work.,I bought this with my GBA and it did not work well at all. The light is too focused and creates too much glare to see the game any better than with no light at all. I have found the Pelican Light Shield to be a much better device which has the added benefit of protecting the screen when not in use and at the same price as the worm light.
2,DON'T BUY,This light is very stupid it leaves a dumb glare on the screen which can be very frustrating!There are much better lights that you can get for your Gameboy other than this.
1,piece of junk,"this thing is a piece of junk! it broke on me when i used it for about an hour.And when i try putting a link cable in, it doesn't fit.and besides, it has a small light,and it only gives half the light as a game boy color wormlight. so try something with better light unless you want something brakes and doesn't work well at all!! story of a true story"
2,DO NOT BUY!,This item drains your batteries really fast because it needs so much power to light up the screen stay away from it!
1,An embarrassingly bad light,"The GameBoy Advance Wormlight is one of the few occasions where Nintendo didn't get it right. The only problem that affects the GameBoy advance is its lack of a backlit screen. In normal light, this usually isn't a problem, but for naturally dark games (like ""Castlevania"") and playing in poorly lit conditions, it can be an issue. Alas, the Wormlight does nothing to fix the problem. In many ways, it makes it worse. Instead of providing a broad, soft light to enhance the screen, this light produces a narrow, harsh glare. The glare created practically washes out any ability to see what is happening on the screen. Check out some other lights or just go completely without one rather than wasting money on this one."
2,Avoid This!,"You would think that the Worm light for the Game Boy Advance would be as good as the Worm light for the Game Boy Color. It is not -- this is because the Game Boy Advance does not put out as much voltage to its link port as the Game Boy color -- so the Worm light is very dim! It is OK if you put a Game Boy Color Game in the system -- then the voltage in the link port is higher and the light is brighter. If you are looking for a good light buy a Light Shield Advance for ($) at your local GameStop/Babbages. You also might want to try Interact's GlowGuard -- which is similar looking to the Light Shield Advance, except I think it might be thinner at the top -- which was my only complaint with the Light Shield Advance."

2,Not the Best,"This light isn't as good as the TrapLight light for GameBoy Advance. It has a blue-ish glow and the glare can get in the way of your game. In my opinion if you want to play where it's darker, I would definitely use the TrapLight light for the GameBoy Advance. That one has a white shine and does not create a big glare. Not the best light you can buy."
3,It's okay if you have to play in the dark,"Unfortunately, my title pretty much sums it up. I'm 38 and enjoy playing Gameboy and it's always annoyed me not to have enough light. This definetely helps, but the white light annoys me even more than not having enough light. What I've done, is turned off all the lights and played with just the worm light and that helped alot. Try it that way. The white light is still there but not as annoying because your using only the worm light to see with. Great in cars and if you share a bedroom."
3,Game Boy advance should come with the lite,the game boy advance should come with the lite. It was difficult for our grandson to play with the game without the lite. We had to purchase the lite to protect his sight!! Not a safe toy by our standards and we will be very careful in the future purchasing from this company.
1,Where's the light?,"With the success of the previous worm light you would think this is the one to get for GBA. Well think again. The light blocks the view of the screen, while barely lighting more than the single bright spot it projects on the screen. Look elsewhere for a light."
4,I can see in the dark.,"Playing gameboy was always a problem but now with this light it's not. The light is bright enough for you to see in the dark and you bend to put in a certain position and it won't break. The only bad thing is, is that it drains the batteries faster. So if you get this, make sure you have long lasting batteries but even withou the battery draining, it's a good thing to buy for a person with a GBA."
2,Doesn't really work,"Well, it has a pretty dim light.And there is also a lot of glare.And if you thought that(like I did) that it is ajustible, it isn't really.When you try to bend it a different way, it bounces back, unless you bend it really hard.The only reason that I did give it 2 stars, is because, I have tried one other light, and it was [bad] too, and I asume the other ones are also pretty [bad], so I am grading it on a curb."
1,YUK,"If there was one thing i could wipe out of my memory, it's this movie. It is the substantial evidence that Kevin Costner can't act!This movie was totally created in the hype of supernatral thrillers, which i happen to love and some worth mentioning are The others and the sixth sense, but it bombed terribly because every single moment is predictable and awful. The story is good until it reaches the end of the movie and you have the urge to yell at the person sitting next to you!The one star which i gave is for Kathy Bates who appear in a minor role. the bottom line is, THIS MOVIE IS A PIECE OF GARBAGE. Stay away."
1,There is one word that describes this movie: garbage,"Why? I'll tell you:1. A script that could have been written by a random-cliche generator.2. Godawful acting by everyone involved. You could actually see some of the more talented actors questioning why they were in this movie as they delivered their wooden, dead lines.3. Nauseating cinematography. And completely inept direction.4. A plot so obvious and boring, that I would rather slowly cut my own fingers off with a rusty spoon than watch this movie again.Summary: No suspense, no drama, no talent. Save your money, and switch on Lifetime instead to get your weepy fix."
1,Dreadful,"The only thing worse than the acting is the plot and dialogue. I do not have necessarily high standards. I liked ""The Postman"", a Costner film many hated. This film may become a classic as regards the ""Morose School of Acting"", or an example of how a bad film can be made much worse with a really dumb ending. The added features on the DVD helped me to dislike the film even more."
2,"Much less , than I expected .","The commercials for this film made me believe , this will be a very good movie . Commercials was wrong ! This was ( and still is ) just a medioca film with very good actors .Kevin Costner is a one of the best actors in the USA ... but even him couldn't save a very downhill script . Welcome to reality !? Story is promissing : his wife died in acsident in South America ...but he can feel her around the house ... he can se her ... he can tell , she is still around ! And she wants him to get the massage ! We don't know , what the massage is ... but we understand - there is one to exist . Nobody believes him ... all his friends thinks - he is getting crasy ... you are all wrong !- we feel . Exellent field for intrigue , developing of the story ... it didn't develope anywhere ???! We found ourselfes in the dead end . I don't know why ... May be ... not enough talant ??? May be . But not in the actors side . They performed on highest level !"
1,"Boy, did this movie [stink]","I usually like most of the Costner films, that the critics hate, but this is one truly silly movie. The pacing was so slow you could knit a sweater between scenes and not miss anything. This is a script that purports to be about faith. I think, the only faith involved is the viewer's in believing it's worth the price and it is not. This movie is unwatchable!"
4,Enjoyable Film... worth watching,"Ok..lets get this out right up front...Dragonfly is not comparable to The Sixth Sense... with that said I found it to be a well crafted movie, that while not suspenseful is still good storytelling. It is more of a love story than a ghost story and the ending is one of the best in a recent film. Kevin Costner is unfairly lambasted by critics, and while his choice in movies can be questioned, his acting skills remain sharp. He was believable in his part as the grief striken doctor. Ignore the critical bashing this movie has been getting, it is an enjoyable, if somewhat under developed film."
3,Pretty Decent For Costner....,"This 'near-death experience' film stars Kevin Costner as a doctor desperately seeking a sign from his missing presumed dead wife. He starts getting those signs through young patients in his hospital who have in comas or flat lined and came back to life. Directed by Tom Shadyac (Ace Ventura), the film is well paced and a bit scary at times, but holds well until the ending which I think really worked! I didn't know what to expect and even though the film hints at what the ending will be, it throws you in the last minute. Better than I expected. ***1/2 Stars"
3,Solid and entertaining,"Look it is not a masterpiece of world cinema, but as a ghost story, it has its moments. There are some genuine frights and next to no violence. It works together quite well.If you cannot guess the ending, you lose all marks in the ghost story stakes. Kevin Costner is creditable as the anxious hero being buffeted by his ex-wife's spirit. There is nothing remarkable about the film or anything particularly wrong. It is a solid piece of entertainment which knows what it is doing and does it well.If you like good ghosts stories. Why not watch it."
1,Its more a comedy than a supernatural thriller!,"This has been one of the worst movies of the year 2002, and its also one of the mosr medicore supernatural thrillers I've seen! The plot is so fantasticly ridiculous and Kevin Costner proves he can't act. The ending of the story is as absurde as watching this movie. Please if you don't have nothing else to watch, still don't watch this!"
3,Unpredictable....,"This movie will keep you guessing until the very end.Kevin Costner's acting is not his best; but, it does get better as the movie goes along.Very interesting premise of communicating with the dead, one I think we all at some time hope for."
4,An Overlooked Heart Warming Thriller,"This is a wonderful movie that somehow was swept under the carpet. It got lost in the shuffle of the multitude of new film releases and the big studio productions, but it deserved better.Think of it as ""Phenomonon"" combined with ""Ghost"" and you have a very captivating, well written and directed movie. Well known, vetran actors add the finishing touch.Its a love story and a paranormal thriller combined, and it challenges the mind and captures the heart simultaneously. Once hooked, you stay hooked, until the very end, when your emotions take control and leave you feeling great, as tears of happiness overtake you."
2,dragonfly dvd,I have not had a chance to view the movie so I really hope its in good conditione like it stated the box cover and dvd seemed a bit raggedy and scratchy to me
4,Entertaining,"Although this isn't a smash hit for Costner, I thought it was a touching and sometimes scary little movie. The ending threw me. I have no idea why I didn't see it coming but I didn't. I would say it was worth the price but bring your own popcorn and snacks."
1,The first 20 minutes...,"...or so are promissing and even a little eerie - then it all goes down hill. Fast. Really fast. Really, really fast. The last 20 minutes are so incredibly ridiculous that we found ourselves laughing out loud. This is NOT the thriller you expected. More like something you would expect from Lifetime TV, only not as good."
1,YUK,"If there was one thing i could wipe out of my memory, it's this movie. It is the substantial evidence that Kevin Costner can't act!This movie was totally created in the hype of supernatral thrillers, which i happen to love and some worth mentioning are The others and the sixth sense, but it bombed terribly because every single moment is predictable and awful. One memorable moment is when a child copies the scene of Haley joel-osmont in the sixth sense-i see did people- which was performed brilliantly by young talented Haley, in the most nerve-wrecking way, i actually burst-out with laughter when this boy was done. The story is good until it reaches the end of the movie and you have the urge to yell at the person sitting next to you!The one star which i gave is for Kathy Bates who appear in a minor role. the bottom line is, THIS MOVIE IS A PIECE OF GARBAGE. Stay away."
2,"Why Kevin, why ???","Let me star off by saying I'm a big Kevin Costner fan, I've seen all his movies, even the bad ones, but this one is his worst. Kathy Bates is great, but the rest of the movie is garbage. Watch The Postman again, at least that one had great views and it was funny, this Dragonfly is just shameful."
1,Bad Movie,"Excruciating to have to sit through, at the end of the day Costner is just a world class bore, whilst the rest of the movie is simply embarrasing at best."
2,Where is Mel when we need him?,"This movie has a great story line and a lot of possibilities. Everything about it was pleasureable and up to standards until Kevin Costner appears. He is NO actor. He has no presence, no passion. His delivery is weak and flat. If Mel Gibson had played the part of Dr. Darrow, the film would have taken wing. The supporting cast can only do so much to carry an actor with no talent."
4,Kevin Costner play a excellent role,"Dragonfly is a slow moving movie, keeps you guessing about the wife and what really happens to her, I would see it again.Has some frightening parts, puts overall its good."
2,"Dragonfly,please fly away!","This movie was about the worst movie I've seen all summer.It hada pretty good storyline,and a fewexciting jump scenes,but mostly kept you wishing it would end so you could leave and go do something that's worth doing.Costner delivered a fairly well performance,but not good enough to watch!OK,so I give it a 2 out of 5."
4,I'll admit it... (possible spoiler - don't read if you haven't seen it),"At the end of the movie, I get all choked up and some wet brinely-like substance drips onto my face out of the corner of my eyes. I first rented this movie when it came out a few years ago and really enjoyed it. I tend to leave it on whenever I see it on any of the cable channels that show it often. The last scene in the jungle of Venezuela is just beautiful and, seriously, being the father of a baby boy and a 3 year old beautiful little girl, I can never get enough of that scene. I completely feel Kevin Costner's emotion come through in this scene and the whole movie as well. Great acting, very nice plot and an awesome soundtrack make this well worthwhile. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because, for as enjoyable as it was, the only movies that get 5 stars for me are the classics like To Kill A Mockingbird, Blazing Saddles, Schindler's list etc."
3,Not really original but o.k.,"A somewhat ponderous tale dealing with the question of what lies beyond. Not really spooky (although it attempts to be). Doctor loves his wife; wife dies, doctor has paranormal experiences; doctor thinks he's going nuts; doctor changes his mind and embraces the paranormal; doctor follows his ghost/wife's instructions and travels to remote location; doctor has closure and happy ending. Not really original but o.k."
3,OH DEATH WHERE IS THY STING?,"My wife cried during some of the scenes in this movie, so it can't be all bad, cause she doesn't cry that often. Anyway, DRAGONFLY is an okay film that attempts to deliver a spiritual message in its own roundabout way. Kevin Costner holds his own, but he doesn't put enough true grief into his portrait, and there are times when he looks extremely bored. Joe Morton is wasted as the one dimensional hospital administrator; Susannah Thompson is effectively heroic and beautiful; Linda Hunt is Linda Hunt in a nun's habit; catch ""General Hospital's"" Peter Hansen in the dinner scene; and of course, the real stars of this movie are the two brilliant child actors who play Jeffrey and Ben. They are so warm and convincing in their roles--they should have great careers as adults. The direction is moody and intense; and despite the sometimes incredibility of the plot, it holds your attention and ends on a supremely upbeat note.RECOMMENDED TO THOSE WHO LIKE A THREE OR FOUR HANKY MOVIE."
1,Pure and Simple.,"... The First 20 minutes or so are promising and even a little eerie - then it all goes down hill. Fast. Really fast. Really, really fast. The last 20 minutes are so incredibly ridiculous that we found oursleves laughing out loud. This is NOT the thriller you expected. More like something you would expect frome Lifetime TV, only not as good."
1,Damaged dvd,This dvd arrived with a crack in it and was not viewable. Please do not buy from this seller.
4,Dragonfly,I like this movie. My parent haven't seen this movies and they like it. One things I don't like about it is subtitle. I like close caption better. That my opinion. The movie was great.
2,OH OH.....,"Kevin Costner is a grieving widower who believes his deceased wife is trying to contact him. Supernatural drama from the director of Patch Adams is pretty dull and silly in excution, with some good ideas but mostly poorly excuted. The finale is surprisingly pretty good, with a twist ending that actually worksm but can't make up for everything else that's so lackuster. Costner's okay here, acting the same way he usually does in all his films."
2,So bad - its (almost) good,"I wanted to like Dragonfly. The premise was intriguing, at least for those who appreciate paranormal storylines, and it seemed as though everything would fall satisfying into place. Unfortunately, the ""twist"" at the end undid every good thing the filmmakers had already established. I don't require a film to be believable-that seems to miss the point of the medium's capabilities altogether. However, I destet mediocrity. And Dragonfly is medicore. There are a few good thrills here, but the end is so maddening that all the good points that came before are quickly forgotten. I found Dragonfly a waste even as a rental."
2,So bad - its (almost) good,"I wanted to like Dragonfly. The premise was intriguing, at least for those who appreciate paranormal storylines, and it seemed as though everything would fall satisfying into place. Unfortunately, the ""twist"" at the end undid every good thing the filmmakers had already established. I don't require a film to be believable-that seems to miss the point of the medium's capabilities altogether. However, I destet mediocrity. And Dragonfly is medicore. There are a few good thrills here, but the end is so maddening that all the good points that came before are quickly forgotten. I found Dragonfly a waste een as a rental."
4,Much better than you've probably heard...,"This is an uplifting tale of one man's journey to find out what his wife has been trying to communitcate to him from beyond the grave. It is not particularly scary (save a scene or 2), but the acting is strong and the dialog is good. There are some special effects but not many, and very little action. The film relies on its dialog, its plot, and its lush and attractive sceneries to keep the viewer interested. Normally I am not a fan of these type of movies, but I liked this one and here is why: This movie does not try to be funny, does not try to be a tearjerker (although maybe a little in the end...), and does not try to overwhelm you with FX. It is just a thriller with a plot that I have never seen done before, that carries a message of inspiration. It was done quite elegantly and was an excellent way to spend a couple of hours."
3,Dragonfly,"This is based on the film of course. Being passionate about ""Dragonflies"" I was very curious about the role that they would portray in the movie. Firstly, based on the trailers I saw, I feared that they were being shown as something ""evil"", and that made me resent the movie before I'd seen it. Secondly, Mr. Costner, is not one of my favourite actors.The story itself was very good, and without giving away the ending, I can truthfully say, that it held my interest through out. If the director would have selected say, William Petersen or Mel Gibson as the star, I would have liked it much better.But I want to definately add it to my DVD collection. And I wish that I could purchase the paperweight and mobile for my home."
3,Ok movie a bit cheesy though,"Costner as you know made terrible movies (The Postman :O) in his carreer (and great stuff too though) Well I decided to give a shot to this one. Even if it's not the best movie ever and not the best acting from Costner, I will say I was positively surprised. The end is a bit cheesy (kind of girly end) but I liked the work made by the director and cinematographer, the lighting and SFX were good too. It's a good entertaintement for an empty afternoon if you see what I mean."
2,"""Ghost"" - Lite","The posters for ""Dragonfly"" pose this question: If someone you love dies..are they gone forever? I suppose it's a rhetorical question because, whenever a movie asks such a question, its answer is invariably ""No way!"" Otherwise, there would be no movie.There is the hope/dream/belief in almost all mankind that there is something beyond life as we know it. But, I suspect that, if anyone called you from the beyond the way Kevin Costner's dead wife does in ""Dragonfly"", you'd wind up in a mental institution before you found out what she was trying to reveal is kind of neat. Too bad the movie's makers felt it neccessary to resort to obvious and pedestrian storytelling.Sadly, ""Dragonfly"" does nothing to revive the flagging career of Mr. Costner, who is entirely wrong for the role. He can be a rather good actor, and I hope his fortunes turn in the near future. In the meantime, he needs to avoid any script that mentions dragonflies."
1,Bad Movie,Horrible. The only thing that is good is Kathy Bates. It is a good story but a terrible movie.
2,SLOW LY FADING AWAY........,"What is happening with Kevin? If one has to be honest, Kevin Costner's last really amazing film was the 1990 Dances with wolves, with strong characters, a good plot and a quite interesting romantic undertone. After that movie,winner of seven Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director, Kevin Costner seems a bit lost lately.This Dragonfly contraption is not only sloooooow, and sthereotypically acted, but also dwells with a bad script.To the reviewers that see good acting by Costner in this flick, I would suggest some 101 acting lessons, in order to judge not based upon the movie star status, but on real substance......."
5,"Great movie, keeps you on edge, looking for unexpected","Have viewed Dragonfly several times. Kevin Costner favorite actor, played the part of grieving husband well,but he felt there was still hope because wife's body never found. Even after first visit to village camp when wife died he wasn't ready to move on. Kathy Bates is a supportive friend throughout movie. Dragonfly is intriging,scary at times, heart goes out to husband as he begins to see signs in his house and at hospital that causes him to go the distance, through packing her things,the bird, discovering the symbol on the map where his wife had gone on missionary effort to village. Costner had to get closure and only way was to return to village where bus went off road into a river. The ending is so beautiful will bring tears to the viewers eyes. This is a must have DVD for home."
3,"Entertaining, But Once You Know The Ending....Well","This is mainly a vehicle for Kevin Costner, who dominates the film. There really is no co-star of the movie.Despite a film that centers around atheists and has a disappointing finish, I still found the film interesting. Knowing the ending, and that it wasn't that good, won't inspire me to watch this again unless it's years from now and I've forgotten it. I'll just remember it was an entertaining movie.Th middle part of this 104-minute movie is the best and is scary in parts. It's beautifully filmed and looks great on DVD. Also, the profanity is very low. All in all, if you haven't seen it, it's definitely recommended but I would hesitate before buying it. This is just not a film you would watch over and over."
2,What was he thinking?,"I've got to say that I have been a loyal fan of Kevin Costner (I have ALL his movies, even the bad ones), but this movie does take stomach and effort to watch. It is the most predictable film you'll ever see: you know that the children will give him messages, you know that that strange bird will announce his dead wife's arrival, and when the big surprise comes at the end, you just don't care anymore. Kevin does his usual part, the director (let's not waste time saying his name) has the Reader's Digest idea of what suspense is, and the writer wrote things like: ""Por favor, go home, seÃ±or"". Do they really believe that we, latinamericans, speak like that (in Spanglish)? I am very sorry that Mr. Costner hasn't had a hit in a while, but it is also a shame that his name is in such a horrible and mediocre film like this one. Watch The Postman again, at least that one had great views and it was funny (I'm not sure if on purpose), this Dragonfly is just shameful."
1,A sad and strange movie,"This movie has good sides, like all the beautiful pictures, a breathtaking suspense near the end, and the interesting parrots.. Also the story is very original and thus allows for an interesting switch from dialy realities.However, I found the story is a bit too unreal, too strange, too far-fetched, and I did not like the sadness emerging from the movie, even though it is a soothing sort of sadness ... quite a peculiar feeling."
2,Dragonfly - A Waste Of Time And Money,"Dragonfly tires hard to achevie an ethereal quality, but the mundance script keeps it relentlessly earthbound. The film is neither suspensful nor romantic, nor intriguing enough to makeit truly effective as either a thriller, a love story, a fantasy or - as the film undoubtedly would prefer - a combination of all three."
5,i loved this movie,I thought Kevin Costner was awesome and i loved the plot...especially the ending. This is a great movie and i reccomend it to everyone.
3,Fine but not great,"If you're looking for more insight into how the Doctor and Rose felt or thought about each other at this early stage in their relationship, you're going to have to stick to fanfic. If you want MOAR NINE (as I did, cuz 13 episodes was NOT enough), you may be disappointed. This book is all plot and no characterization. It's not as exciting, emotionally poignant or funny as the tv show, but if you want a good ""aliens and robots in interwar London"" romp, it will provide. I looked forward to reading it for a little escapism during my commute."
3,"Tick Tock, the Ninth Doc","Starts really slow. Then it gets intriguing. Then there's a string of false crescendoes - seeming climaxes that just spill into one another. Some elements and themes are overplayed, such as masks and clocks. Finally, there were several scanning transcription errors throughout, most notably 1s for 'I's. The book would have been profoundly improved to introduce the actual mystery earlier and then to provide a more focsued heightening of plot tension, rather than a series of pseudo-climaxes serving only to confuse and frustrate the reader. I had a few other beefs, but they cannot be divulged without spoilers. I will say, however, that I thought the portrayals of both Rose and the Ninth Doctor were very apt."
2,"Entertaining and somewhat clever, but nothing special","Rose and the Doctor land in 1924 London to attend the British Empire Exhibition. As usual, they find someone in trouble and that trouble leads to aliens: this time the mysterious Painted Lady and mechanical cats and men. The TARDIS disappears, servants are murdered and a sweet little boy helps save the day.At times you can hear the ninth doctor's voice, but at other times you wonder who this man is. The climax at the end with Big Ben was fun. But, on the whole, entertaining and somewhat clever, but nothing special.I did love the ""bad wolf"" comment! Continuity like that really makes my day."
2,Slow and tedious,"Of the first three 9th Doc novels I hear the most raves about this one but find I like it the least. The plot is slow. The mystery is rather tedius. And the climax is far too technical in writing style to be thrilling, as it should be.Add in the fact the 9th Doctor acts more like the 7th while Rose is clearly not herself and this book is a letdown."
2,"Well written, but boring.","First, let me say that I LOVE Dr. Who! Especially the 9th and 10th Doctor. I was so excited to start reading this and was disappointed by how boring it was. I've read Dr. Who fanfiction that was way more exciting. I didn't even finish it..."
2,Not Exciting,I have read some of the other 9th and 10th doctor books and they were exciting and I did not want to put them down. This book I almost had to force myself to finish reading the book. Also a lot of the l's and I's are replaced by 1's.
4,Very Thought Provoking,"Russell Ackoff is one of the better known systems thinkers for a reason. The quality of his thought is really exceptional; I feel smarter just following along as he narrates.Although the book is labeled his best, I think there are definitely better and worse essays included. That is, I think the book would be better if 15% of the least profound essays were removed.I recommend this book as a great introduction to his work and systems thinking in general.I really enjoyed it."
5,Great collection of essays,"This book is a great colection of essays by a brilliant thinker. In essays ranging from topics such as crime, education, psychology, and management, Ackoff manages to outline what systems thinking is truly about. Though I often did not agree with his prescriptions, the creative nature of his solutions very unique, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a thought provoking experience."
2,apolitical point of rferement,"This book, writed by a famous historian, is indicated at the people that are interested in date and number historical referement If you are a researcher of world war 2, this book is for you"
2,RAW DATA,"I passed up this book in a 75% off bin in Ottawa recently.At first I was very enthused,but when I saw the contents I passed. The book reads like a computer data printout.The book may be for you if its your 25th WW2 sub book."
3,The Good with the Bad,"I decided against giving the book 4 stars because, while it represents a worthy achievement, it also has its warts.Consisting entirely of tabular data, the book lists every attack claim and places it alongside the actual results--plenty of ore you'll be mining for a long time.On the downside, a half-hearted translation leaves a platoon of opaque abbreviations--""le"" for Latvian, ""-DP"" for passenger liner, etc--so be prepared to memorize the German shorthand.A book of this nature should be more eager to stay open when you lay it flat on your desk to compare with your notes.The author at times is overly dogmatic in cases of conflicting claims. On the flip side, the sparse textual content occasionally leaves matters unclear.I am glad I made the purchase, but I suggest you do as I did--wait for a sale."
4,DeWalt Quality - No Mandrel Included,"This is a decent hole saw, but note the mandrel is not included. Choose one of the following DeWalt mandrels if you don't already have one that fits: DW1818 (3/8""), DW1802 (7/16""), DW1803 (7/16""), DW1804 (5/8"")."
2,Design Flaw,"While the appearance is good, I am disappointed with the fact that its design reduces its useability. The top cover is held on by a strechy piece of black cloth that hides part of the phone's screen unless you push it up manually. Initially a minor inconvienence. Eventually, a major pain."
5,S.P.M. fan,I give MAD props to S.P.M. for coming up with another dope record and keep it real S.P.M.
3,might work for you,"An idiosyncratic, ifnot pretentious, collection. Far from being a succinct analysis of his topics, he muses over and wanders about the theme he chooses. But he is high quality, a high-brow Eco, so on occasion his writing opens up new fascinations. I must say that if much has gone over my head this is because he's a professional philosopher and I'm a retail assistant.I came to this as Agamben is admired by Baudrillard, someone I do understand and admire. But don't expect the same fireworks."
3,Dope.,"This disc probably isn't that essential, but for the fanatic it's a must. It's a pretty solid mix of stuff. ""24 With An L"" is good, and I really like ""My Skin Is My Sin"". But this also has some sweet remixes. ""I Was A Good Day"" is different but good, and my favorite is ""U Ain't Gonna Take My Life"", which has great lyrics, and samples the Chili Peppers ""Sir Psycho Sexy"", and En Vogue's ""Never Gonna Get It"". The last track is a sweet continuous mix of many of ""Cubes"" past hits. If you're a fan of his early 90's stuff, check out ""Bootlegs & B-Sides""."
5,Cube brings up important issues in his raps,"Ice Cube's 'Bootlegs and B-sides' may be considered slow in part because it doesn't have all the slick rhymes and trash talk attitude heard so much on MTV recently; but Ice Cube is one of the greatest rappers alive because of his lyrical content.He raps about racism from cops, street violence, and making it to heaven. He makes it clear that his mind is not set on making money anyway he can; I would definitely categorize him with Tupac.WESTSIDE FOR LIFE, BABY!"
4,"another great lonely planet guide, but are they slipping into mainstream?",Another good Lonely Planet guide to travelling. Good info on the more out of ordinary and some good tips on eating and accomodation. However I think they are slipping into mainstream and cutting corners. For the future I would like to see more out of ordinary travelling for example everyone knows a bit about the Greek Islands but what about the Peloponnese? Would love to see this expanded.
3,Not her best,I have read all of this author's Elizabeth MacPherson series. In my opinion this is a disappointing book in the series. I would recommend that others try her earlier works.
2,Dolphins are not McCrumb's strong suit!!!,"To be perfectly honest I just couldn't get past the thing with the dolphin. I thought it was sick, twisted, and unworthy of a writer of Sharyn McCrumb's caliber. I have read every single one of McCrumb's books, all three series and while If I'd Killed Him... was undeniably funny and had some very valid things to say the dolphin's final scene just ruined it for me. Maybe I'm more puritan than I'd like to think but the only thing I could think of after I finished the book (besides ""eeewwww! GROSS!) was that anyone who would devalue humans as much as that character did deserved what happened to her. I'm happy to say that this is the ONLY one of McCrumb's books I've ever been turned off by and I'm glad she seems to be concentrating all her writing energy on her ballad books. They are like jeweled treasures and this book was a piece of plastic compared to them."
2,A disappointment!,"Having started reading Sharyn McCrumb's books with the Appalachian series, I have to say that I was disappointed in the Elizabeth MacPherson books. They just don't have the depth of her other series (even ""Bimbos of the Death Sun"" is more interesting) and just don't capture my interest."
2,Not the best,I read this as a book club selection - and we all wondered why we'd picked it. Not the best storylines to say the least. The one that involves the dolphin is especially ridiculous.
2,ridiculous,"I bought the book because I absolutely loved ""The Song Catcher"" and the title intrigued me. However, this book is not up to McCrumb standard. What was she thinking???Why would you put some assinine story about a relationship with a dolphin! in with the rest of this book? The other ""stories"" in the book wove together nicely as a good mystery. Why, oh why, add that nonsense about the dolphin? I may never read another of her books because of this. I can't believe the difference between this and the incredible ""Song Catcher"""
4,Moving and fun mystery about human relationships,"Another visit with Clan MacPherson. Elizabeth is back in the states mourning Cameron, who is lost at sea, and working as an investigator for her brother's law firm.Her parent's divorce is final and Elizabeth's mother has decided to be a political lesbian. Her brother is handling a murder case where the wife of a bigamist is accused of murdering her husband, and also helping a woman marry a dolphin. Bill MacPherson's law partner, A.P. Hill, is also handling a murder case where a woman shot her ex-husband and his new wife in cold blood.Not a particularly restful way for Elizabeth to deal with the disappearance of her beloved Cameron. It does make for some fun and fascinating reading for the audience. It will also make you think about the relationships in your own life."
4,A thought provoking book disguised as a light mystery.,"McCrumb has written a thought provoking book disguised as light mystery. Returning heroine Elizabeth McPherson, mourning the disappearance of her husband, joins her brother's law firm as an investigator. The plot revolves around a suspicious death in the present that mimics an unsolved murder from 100 years earlier. To solve one, means to solve the other. Elizabeth uses her expertise as a forensic anthropologist to do just that. What makes this book stand apart from the other Elizabeth McPherson books is the thread that runs throughout of spousal abuse and abandonment. The title is from a quote overheard from an abused woman: ""If I'd killed him when I met him, I'd be out of jail now."" While the mystery is entertaining, the undercurrent of abuse, abandonment, and loss of faith, leaves the reader with an aftertaste that is slow to go away. One must wonder what events were occuring in the author's life as she penned this novel."
4,Read this one - you will never forget it.,"Lighter than the author's more serious books, nevertheless this story has an edge to it.Entertaining with surprises as well as social consciousness.Try to catch up with this one - I don't think you'll regret it."
3,kind of depressing,"I've read and enjoyed most all of Sharyn McCrumb's books. This one was as good as the others, except for one thing. It was unusually depressing. A woman dies attempting to perform a strange sex act. A beloved character is lost at sea throughout the novel, and does not return in the end. And other little things like that. It's hard to describe. I would guess the author must have been going through some hard times while she was writing it, most likely involving men. Or maybe it was just a theme she decided on, something like this: Everyone's lives can get turned upside-down with no notice, and you can't expect easy answers, quick fixes, or happy endings."
3,"funny, good read but...","What is up with the dolphin story line? I see no need for it and it added nothing to the book. Other than that, this was a good book, liked how the story wrapped up."
5,Ministry of Healing,"I read thi book for the first time when I was 25 and am reading through it again the second time. There is so much valuable information in this book that reading it once can sometimes mean missing something important. It is a womderful book for any family looking for a happier way to live healthier physically, mentally, emotionally and spiritually."
5,Ministry of Healing,Wonderful book to read and reference to as needed. Gives great insight to spiritual and physical health concerns and issue. A must have book.
3,"Great, but not for everyone","I am a sommelier in a fine dining restaurant, and while I have found this book particularly helpful, my staff seems to have some issues with it. We used it as a textbook, covering one region per week. I like that it allows me to really visualize the vineyards and understand why the wines are what they are. In the Northern Rhne section, he talks about the steep, terraced vineyards and the stiff Mistral winds... when you understand where the wine is coming from, the wine itself makes sense. For my waiters, though, it was just too much stuffing, and they were unable to extract the information that I wanted them to. Perhaps novices need something more factual and to-the-point rather than an in-depth, evocative narrative? At any rate, I strongly suggest this book as a tool to delve deeper into French wine for those who already have a broad knowledge base. It's not for the beginner though."
2,Moisture affected book,Disappointed with the quality of book received not matching the description - in that it appears to have been stored in damp conditions = dust cover slightly mouldy and the pages don't lay flat. If I had seen this book in a bookstore i would not have purchased
4,Excellent Sound for music!,"the speaker produces very solid sound. I was using onboard sound card. After I bought in another Creative Sound Blaster Audigy SE, I can hear that the sound is even better. Plus, if u have some FLAC (lossless audio file). The sound quality would be better.However, there is some high-pitch sound when there is nothing playing.Overall, best product for this price."
3,Not good enough for the big leagues...,"I am less demanding of computer speakers than I am of my home audio system (I have a fancy set-up) but I got tired of not having decent mid-range from my crappy satellite/subwoofer combo and so ordered these. The second I got these speakers delivered (I have returned them already), I hooked them up and put on Pink Floyd's ""Dark Side of the Moon,"" my benchmark to test any audio system. Mind you, I did not crank the volume way up, just loud enough to hear all the instruments and vocals, however, these speakers distorted whenever the levels (especially on the low end) would rise. I gave them another shot with Miles Davis' ""Kind of Blue"" but found that Paul Chamber's bass would also distort. That killed it. If you want a full-package speaker, look elsewhere. For less demanding use, these will do."
4,Bright sound- good for classical and jazz music,"I compared these computer speakers to the Bose Companion 2 speakers, which are similar in size and features. The GigaWorks speakers are brighter while the Bose have more bass and less treble. Personally, I prefer the GigaWorks sound, which works well for playing classical and jazz music. The sound is natural and smooth across the frequency range. At very loud volume, the speakers can sound a bit harsh, but at normal volume the sound is very pleasant. The sound is excellent for a relatively small two-speaker system. I am satisfied and feel no need to go to a 2.1 system or to larger speakers to enjoy listening to music at the computer."
3,great look-good sound,"I like these speakers once they're on-but I hate that when I turn them on and off they have a little buzz and loud click-like they're shorting out. But hey you get what you pay for. They do look cool and the sound is good for small speakers. I actually was suprised that they were not smaller, I guess I sould have read the specs a little closer. oops"
2,I spent $XX.xx on computer speakers and recieved?!?!,"These speakers sound good;for the money I spent I wanted great.Harmon brand dell speakers are a better buy for the money.The only plus that you get is extremely high clear treble.I did receive a box with missing parts but managed to salvage the cables needed from a laptop.My suggestion, for the money test the t10 first.If they are not what you are looking for due to the treble,than jump on the t20 train.The bass is not what you would expect considering the bassXports but it is not bad.It is a comfortable balance when used correctly, the highs can get extremely high with the t20, toooo high, almost ear piercing high.At the end of the day I spent around $80.00 a micro hi-fi system with aux in would be a better purchase.Personally the T10 did it for me, worth the money for the sound quality."
2,Nice 2.0 Package-apparently now blown,"I wanted 2.0 speakers because I have limited space for a bass module. These are nice looking, decent,sounding, and have about all the features you could want. The sound is good, but like most users say, the bass doesn't exactly fill the room. Four stars for what they are.Update - now apparently blown. May be my fault, not sure, but would expect that not to happen when connected to a PC."
1,They were great for 2 hours,"They were great for 2 hours, then we heard nothing but buzzing. Apparently this is a pretty wide spread problem with these speakers as noted on Creative's site. How the reviews here are all positive can only lead me to believe their shill reviews. A product can't get 5 stars if it doesn't work."
3,"Ok, not great, no replacement for 2.1 speakers.","I've seen a couple review mention it, so I'd like to mention it as well: these are no replacement for a speaker system with a dedicated subwoofer, no matter how small. I've had my Altec Lansing ATP3 2.1 system for about 4 years now, and they have always rocked, but I was wondering if I could get the same sound in a small, better looking package? Answer is apparently not. Picked up a pair of the T20s to give 'em a try and they are not even half as good. The higher range tones are clear, but a little too bright. The midrange is there, but it's pretty flat. Low range is just ""barely"" there, and only if you pump it way up, which causes distortion. I tried listening to some of my favorite songs, and the ones that depended on the lower end to keep the beat really didn't sound the same at all. Returned the T20s and returned to my ATP3s, no regrets."
2,Crappy sound.,"These sound really crappy for a $99 pair or speakers. Consider a 2 speaker set from Klipsch or Bose instead. I now own the Kilpsch which sound worlds better than this Creative set.Build quality on the Creative feels better than the Klipsch or Bose, but what use is the build if they sound horrible.The Creatives also wimp out on power. Jack them up to full volume and you'll be left wishing for more power. The Klipsch or Bose won't disappoint you power-wise or for sound."
2,Not so Happy with these,Sound is good for the size. Bass is ok for just a pair of desktop speakers. Volume is very minimal hooked to my home computer. Ended up putting my old Altec Lansing speakers back to the PC. Disappointed with these. Nice package but not so powerful sound.
5,Great Product,"I had a speaker set that was pretty good already, but one of the speakers was broken and I was moving to an apartment and wanted to get some speakers without a subwoofer to conserve space and to prevent annoying my neighbors. I have had these speakers for a few months now and I'm very satisfied so far. I did some research before I purchased these and from what I read it seems these are one of the best set of speaker sets without a subwoofer. These speakers look nice and were also affordable. Also, add in the fact that you can use these separately from your computer when the need comes along is a definite plus. I would definitely recommend these."
3,"Decent, but not what I expected.","The high's and mid's are amazing....howeever, like many reviews here....if you think your gonna replace a sub...no way. Maybe my ears are too shot from loving my music loud, but you have to have these babies all the way up to truly enjoy the sound. I'll settle for them, as returning online is too painful."
2,A Creative Lemon...,They sounded beautiful for about two months until the tweeter blew out on me.I would like to point out that I babied these speakers and did not abuse them.I never had any of the levels past 1/2 of the way.Do yourself a favor and DO NOT THROW YOUR MONEY AWAY ON THESE LEMONS!
1,DON'T BUY!,"Our MCSE consultant spent 77 hours installing and dealing with their inept tech support. The final solution was a complete re-write of 5 of their program files (he'd already installed 5 separate and worthless patches). At the end, when we complained, they blamed our consultant and their lawyers sent us a nasty letter and a copy of their license agreement stating they were not to blame no matter what.If you buy this product please send us a check too, since we seemed to have been an intricate part of their R & D (costing us thousands of dollars).In all seriousness, stay away from this product.-Joe"
3,What the hell happened?,"Although I am a huge Token Entry fan,I was disappionted by this album.It lacks the rawness of ""From Beneath the Streets"".They went from pure NYC hardcore to some crazy skateboarding California crapola.The only good song is ""The Fire"""
3,A Good Collection of Various Genres,"This Album Gives you a little bit of everything. Tracks 2,10 and 13 are my favorite. I would recomend this album to anyone who is trying to get a taste of the various Jazz/R&B styles."
4,Haiku Laden Feline Travel Tome,"This has to be the strangest review that I have ever written, as I normally write about current scientific thought, aerospace, and cinema. Though I am not personally a Hello Kitty fan, I purchased this as a birthday gift for a friend who is. I was getting ready to wrap the book when I decided to look inside. In a matter of minutes I had read the entire book which consists of Hello Kitty beautifully photographed in a variety of odd settings, accompanied by a pertinent haiku. My personal favorite was the sailing haiku, to wit:Spray of Blue Ocean,I neglect to trim the sails.Let's not capsize, please!The book will please the Hello Kitty lover in your life; I know it certainly will in mine."
4,"if you buy it, you know what to expect...","You'll see Hello Kitty doing all sorts of girly things in different countries, all with charming pictures (much like the Blythe book), styled with haiku poetry. while the book really offers little in real educational value, it may get your kid interested in the world, poetry, and/or photography, all of which are good, wholesome activities. For just around $10, buy and consider it a cute alternative to most coffee table books."
3,Not bad.............,"Charming and very 'fluffy', its what you would expect ! Aimed more for the younger Kitty fan, its basically nothing more than a selection of cute kitty photos, but good fun.D"
2,a workout ???,BEGINNERS TO ADVANCED???? Uhmmmm It is maybe a good workout for beginners only...Jindra is a good instructor... but the dvd is not well designedthe workouts are boring and you can't hear the music (imagine a workout without music!!!)
2,What The Hell?,"A short story between two hardcovers (large type, lots of whitespace), ""Fantastic Voyage"" as done by Firesign Theatre. If it had been by anyone else but Lethem I'd dismiss it as a failed attempt to be cute, but since it is Lethem let's call it a successful attempt to write poorly."
3,"Scholarly, detailed, objective","Not a quick read, this book will probably tell you lots more than you wanted to know if you have just a casual interest in the subject. That aside, it covers its subject thoroughly. Analyzing word etymology, documents, and institutions, Halperin shows that the Russians borrowed quite a bit from the Mongols -- and that the 300-year ""Tatar Yoke""was far from being a dark age for Russia.One thing that particularly grabbed me: Halperin indicates that pre-conquest Russian scribes attributed nomad raids to punishments from God. So, how did the scribes handle the situation after the conquest, when Christians were under the domination of infidels? By denying the conquest had occurred!"
3,"Nice try, but no cigar","There is little here that is not found in more general histories. He thinks that Russian historians have underestimated the Mongol impact on Russia, so specialists may want to check his interpretation. It can be read as a history of the period, but most general histories will work about as well."
3,The Book for an Anverage Person,"I received The Book a little over a week ago. I have been reading since. While it is easier than the original text of the King James Bible, it can still be difficult to comprehend at times. I am an educated person and still find myself referring to Webster's dictionary. So I would not recommend this for children or teens. You will need to have a vast vocabulary and a dictionary handy."
4,"""The Book"" Review","I had this book and gave it to a close personal friend. This book is an easy stroll through the Bible for those who want to relax in the presence of He who shall not be named. It's a great book for those who have difficulty understanding the Bible and for those who simply do not wish to struggle through a language now obsolete.It takes nothing away from the original works, but rather adds the opportunity to those who may not read the Bible due to fears from past attempts. Reading this book helps to expand the life of so many individuals as well as adding to the ability to see and relax in the Word for the more learned.Sadly, I believe this edition is now out of print in the large print selection. I am grateful I was able to locate and purchase this edition is fairly good condition,. through Amazon. Thank you very much. Dr. D.M.V."
5,Paperback version of living bible,"The Book reads nicely for any level of Bible reader. It's the paperback version of the Living Bible which is the much larger green paperback version published in 1984. Kenneth Taylor's did a fantastic translations that will open any Bible reader's eyes. It still holds up today even though the NLT now supersedes this version with a more academic, translation."
5,Amazing Translation,"I highly recommend ""The Book"" to any serious or casual student of the Bible. ""The Book"" IS the Bible. I have used my copy for years, often giving copies of it as gifts. ""The Book"" uses modern expressions, patterns, and speech idioms that make the books of the Old and New Testaments more easily understood. Particularly helpful are the introductions to each book of the Testaments, where the author, date, content, and theme of each is provided. Additionally, it references parts of the Bible that deal with specific life concerns, such as fear, anger, frustration, pain, guilt, patience, and healing. Also, I would recommend the hard-cover edition which is much more durable than the soft-cover option."
3,Different view,This is an alright book for a mature Christian as things are sometimes distorted in translation. Would not recommed for new Christians
5,the book,I choose this book cause the Bible is hard to understand and you can understand this one I think it's good
5,Can't Believe how fast I rec'd my Book,"I have ordered several of The Books and this one came within 3 days.I was very happy especially because it was doing the Christmas holidays.It was stated it may take extra time due to the holiday, but it came sooner than I expected and in top condtion."
5,Wonderful new hardcover of understandable translated Bible,"I replaced the paperback I had for years and am delighted to have a hard copy of a Bible translated to simplify scripture in current understanding terms. I have other Bibles, but The Book has always been my favorite."
5,Great bible,"It was hard finding a bible that was easy to read and one that included book intros and helps to give to friends.I wanted to get an NIV bible but all lacked simple introductions to each book unless it was a personal NIV study bible, but study bibles are too hefty and not very good for a seeker.The Book is a great bible to give away.Its affordable, book introductions for each book which helps explain the main theme,little devotional section in the back and a great article about the bible.This is a great first bible for anyone and is better than most gift bibles. The New Living Translation is good, easy to read translation. So if you wnat to give a bible to your co-workers, friends, family give them The Book."
4,Excellent!,Very informative DVD. Everything you wanted to know about Air Force One and then some. Can't wait to check out Marine One as well.
3,Another 9-11 Documentary...,"I watched this because I was interested in the plane itself. I'm an aviation buff and have also walked thru the old one at the Air and Space Museum in Seattle. Besides showing the viewers a bit of the interior and informing us it is a 747, six stories tall, and a football field wife, very little information is forthcoming about the plane itself. Most of the episode is about high stress and tensions aboard Air Force One on September 11, 2001, as it flew freely thru the air, keeping the president off the ground and safe while other airliners were grounded.There is also some information about how often Obama is using it. It simply isn't what I was hoping for so three stars."
3,Need more information,"I have both On Board Air Force One and Secret Access Air Force One DVDs. I like the second one better. On Board Air Force One does not give information about supporting Air Force One. Both DVDs do not provide information on the airplane itself that general populate are not already know. Many ""I could tell you but then I would have to kill you"" sentiments in the films."
2,This Cd Is Not The One To Bring Out The Best In David......,"I own every David Davidson cd that is available. This is not what i would consider his best work. The problem with doing a cd on the works of LLoyd Weber is that he doesn't have enough melodic pieces of work to his credit. On this cd there is only 4 songs that i really like. The rest of the songs are sub par, in my opinion."
3,Nice collectable...not a toy,This is a great looking truck but more of a collectable to sit on a shelf.....not something for a kid to play with.
5,Best book for understanding faberge the man and Faberge the firm,Every book on Faberge quotes this one. Why not read the original?This book makes the genius of the Faberge firm clear with wonderful words and beautiful illustrations.
4,Hits the mark,"Wow, what an interesting book. It's easy to tell that Mr. Carss knows of which he speaks. Although written by a person with a military background the information contained within covers the spectrum of who could benefit from the information and training scenarios. Whether it's mantracking or animal tracking the reader is primarily interested in, the lessons, training and observations are real and proven and usable whatever your arena is. Although there are more persons (Wilderness Search and Rescue)who would prefer to track at night than the book leads you to believe it is definately one that deserves to go on the top shelf......for quick reference."
4,Very good.,This book was about Junior Class Competition getting ugly. Then Jessica saves the day by( well just buy it to see what it is ) You wouldnt expect it form jessica. It has to do with Christen Gorman which is terribly sad because jessica and him were meant to be and he died. well jsut buy the book bc it is really good... but it's depressing because elizabeth and todd arent back together yet..
1,Liz should choose Devon or Todd,I think that the book turned out ok in the end Olivia didn't get hurt.Devon said that he still loved Liz though he didn't want to get hurt anymore so I think that Liz should get back together with TODD because he's everything a girl could want in a guy and in What Jessica Wants... Todd went to so much trouble to set up the picnic and it wasn't even their annivarsary it was just a year since Liz wrote for the 1st time on the Oracle.and not many guys try to cook and make the picnic perfect but then again guys usually don't even remember these kinds of date s so I think Liz should realize how LUCKY she is to have TODD and she SHOULD STOP CHEATING ON HIM because TODD AND LIZ'S LOVE IS ONE OF A KIND.I can't believe that when Jessica thought it was Christain she was seeing it was really his younger brother who looked a lot like Christain.The only reason Jess hadn't met him was because he was at his school.
1,Typical Blah Blah Blah,Typical mainline thinking that's so in the box it's reminiscent of what the church was like. What a step back in the past. Give your money to a mission project instead of struggling through the dribble.When will Bishops and other church heirarchy realize people don't care what they say? I was hoping for something different but it isn't!
2,Brittle Plastic Breaks and Pieces are Easy to Swallow,"The soft plastic wheels are great and chewable as well as difficult for the bird to get hold of a piece to swallow.The ""flower"" is brittle plastic.My medium sizes Conure preferred this toy but in only a few minutes had bitten off the ends and swallowed one. This would be a great toy but for the materials."
3,3 1/2 stars out of 5,"I was trying to replace my goose down comforter and have been reading many reviews and searching for quite a while. I have decided on this one. I sleep with a heavy comforter 365 days a year. I am always cold. I was worried that I would get a comforter that wouldn't keep me warm. I only have a full size bed but ordered a king size comforter just in case I needed to fold it over for double the comforter. Well I find that its too much if I fold it over but its not quite enough if I don't. I often find myself falling asleep with it folded and kicking it half of through the night. It is very soft and I no longer have feathers poking me in the face and body through the night. Its not just plain white, it has a pretty white on white design. But it may be too pretty for the single man type. Its 100% cotton. Hopefully after a few washes the cells will still be even. I will plan to do a 6 month update. I rate this comforter 3 1/2 stars out of 5."
4,warm snuggly blanket,"i really like this blanket. as a person who is always cold and allergic to down, i find this one heavy enough to be snuggly and quite warm. very happy with it for wintertime!"
2,Bad stitching and dissolving material,"I'm reviewing this about 10 months after buying it. Two things have occurred in those 10 months that should discourage you from buying this comforter.One, within the first two months of buying, the internal stitching (that keeps the ""down"" material evenly spread throughout the comforter) came apart internally. This means that all of the artificial down floats around in the comforter. It is lumpy and unattractive. It also makes parts of the blanket not insulating (and makes it feel flat and cheap.)The second thing is after about 6 months the outer material began dissolving at certain points. That is, it wore so thin that a hole appeared where the internal material falls out. I have had to stitch five separate holes, making it look almost comical.Neither of these problems were created by harsh washing (it's practically impossible to get this thing in a washing machine anyways.) While initially I loved this comforter, it did not last even a year."
5,Solution to cold New England apartment,I live in an older apartment with old fashioned radiators that don't always work that well. The windows are drafty and the bedroom has two outside walls. It can get pretty cold. This blanket is the perfect solution and it's beautiful to look at and feel against your skin. You can feel the heat being trapped within seconds of getting under it. I can see how this blanket could be too hot for someone living in a normally heated home. The bonus is that you can wash it in the washing machine. I wouldn't throw it in the dryer.
3,Decent album,"You can really see the development of the west-coast ""sound"" on albumsof this year (1994). This album is notable for students of the genre for this alone. Lyrically the Da Lench Mob continue to bring their same brand of hard hitting social commentary, community upliftment with some humor thrown in. The vocals of J-Dee are sorely missing here though.Pick this up if you are a fan of later 90's west coast sound in Hip-Hop."
3,rather limp,Lacks the energy and humour of Guerrillas in tha Mist. Features more real instruments and female vocals - not my cup of tea really. GITM is a classic rap album; this is not.
4,Fun-Happy Music! Cellabration,"This CD is very happy. After listening I could not stop smiling.The tunes are singable. The musicianship on the dixieland tracks as well as the others is excellent! This CD allows the young listener to hear real musical instruments and different musical styles, and might provide inspiration for them later to participate in music (school or at home).I am very glad I ordered it for myself and as gifts for nieces and nephews.I shared the Amazon link with my school teacher friends in several states. Thanks for providing the listening excerpts link!"
1,Disappointing DVD,"I agree with the other comments about poor video quality.An LSU friend of mine had a different complaint. They kept trying to watch the DVD, but it kept stalling about halfway through."
1,Poor Recording Quality,The quality of this recording is terrible. I can't believe the BCS would knowingly license a DVD this poor. It's a real stretch giving it even one star.
1,Very Poor Quality DVD,"I was excited about being able to have this game on DVD (especially since I was actually there). However, I am extremely disappointed by the quality of the video. Atrocious. Its like I am watching something in lower resolution on YouTube. I had previously downloaded a HD copy from iTunes and the quality is much better. This DVD was produced by XO Digital and they apparently have the exclusive rights to the BCS and SEC game reproductions. XO clearly dropped the ball and has put forth a very poor quality product apparently in an effort to make a quick buck from the fans. To make matters worse, the DVD could not be detected and was unplayable by the DVD drive of my new Dell laptop."
2,low video quality - great game,"Everyone is right. The quality is not great ... more like a good VHS tape. But the game is all there and it is all complete.If you want a high-definition version, download the one from i-tunes. It is only $3.99. The quality is great! It was available weeks before the DVD was cut and I downloaded it to my i-pad, which I could then watch through my TV in high-def. (Beware though; the file is 4GB and takes a very long time to download.) -- ROLL TIDE!"
1,THE WORSE - EVER!!!,"Must be a bunch of LSU folks working over at XO Sports Productions. I'd blurr the image as much as possible to forget the pain as well. Seriously, how could something this bad even make it off of the production line and even listed on Amazon for sale!!?? Yep, everyone is right - buy the HD version on iTunes.Oh yeah, I almost forgot -- ROLL TIDE!!!!!!!!"
3,Poor Picture Quality,"The content of the DVD was good, short pregame chat between Herbstreit and Musburger, with the presentation of the trophy at the conclusion of the game. The picture quality of the the DVD was poor, leaving me with a less than satisfied feeling, therefore the three star rating. It seems to me the whites are too bright and the darker colors are much too dark, and with much adjusting of color level, sharpness, tint, brightness, and contrast, I was able to find a somewhat happy medium but not a very satisfactory one. In all fairness, it's not as bad as some reviews have made it out to be, but it's not the best picture either. Hope this review helps."
3,Interesting read,This is the first Tess Darcy book that I've read of her series. I have to admit I bought it because of its Christmas theme which turned out to be about putting on a Christmas pageant. The idea that a small-town church would hire someone to run its pageant seemed a little far-fetched but thats where the murder comes in. While reading the book I wondered how the main character can run a bed & breakfast with all the extra-curricular things she is doing. I did enjoy the characters and will probably read the rest of the series to get to know the characters better. I enjoyed Tess & her friends and family and I think you will too.
3,"OK, but not great","I'm using this to hang an old Trapdoor Springfield rifle on the wall. Quality is OK, and I'm happy with it other than the way it attaches to the wall. I would be more comfortable if the screws went through a hole rather than just a notch on the sides. The photos are accurate as far as what you get."
3,not designed well,"It looks nice and does the job if you are good with tools. The holes meant for the screws are small and if you don't place the screws perfectly the hangers could slip out of the slots. If you do mount it correctly and use large head screws, it works okay."
4,great for black powder rifles,"These Hoppes brass wall mounts worked great for displaying my Hawkens smokepole. the only critique would be to cast it with full wrap mounting holes( not adding that much more brass) and should be used with dry wall mollies if going to hang to drywall. Can not see using for anything like modern weapons, large forearm pumps and like weapons. The brass goes so well with the brass patch box in stock and double set trigger guard.Minus one star for mounting flaw in my opinion."
4,Quick delivery,"Delivered insanely fast, a day ahead of the earliest estimated delivery day in fact. Item as described, although the photo online is a completely different colour. Still, the description clearly states brass and everyone should know what to expect without needing a photo to tell them."
5,Sturdy and nice looking,"I bought this for my husband to hang a Civil War sword. It fit perfectly! Instead of placing the sword tip on the top piece wear the felt is, he slid it underneath and it makes the sword much more stable and totally unable to fall off the wall. Great item and would reccommend it."
2,Cracked.Scratched,"This is the SECOND solid brass gun display hangers I've received from Amazon. This set, similar to the first, has places on the brass supports that are cracked from one side of the support to the other. On this set, it looks like they tried to buff over the cracks, and overdid the buffing resulting in scratching of the brass coating. Also, on the one end that goes against the wall, the brass coating is pocketed and missing - just like on the first set.These products must be rejects from Hoppe's otherwise excellent suppliers."
4,Nice looking gun hangers,"Got these to display an antique gun on the wall. They look really great and professional. The hangers are very solid and have a strip of suede material on them to keep from scratching your gun. I wished it came in more colors like silver or antique bronze; however, I suppose you could paint the hangers. I also wish the mounting holes were not open as it would make hanging them easier. The screws that come with the hangers might work for mounting in a wall stud or wood but not for drywall. I mounted them through drywall with some heavy duty drywall anchors and the hangers are very solid and won't move at all. I yanked on them pretty hard and I am confident they won't fall or slide out with a heavy gun mounted on them."
1,all grown down!,Do not watch all grown up at all.Its one of the stupidest shows ever made.The only good one is iterview with a campfire . A new episode was on this morning and by the middle I knew the only thing that could save it was if chuckie threw tommy's girlfriend over a mountain and then chuckie and tommy fought a battle and became emnies when they grew up!This show lacks the oringal's adventure.DO NOT WATCH THIS SHOW.
1,I hate this show and will never watch it again!,This show is so stupid.I hope this crude sho will be cancelled!
3,Who was this book written for?,"Okay, I found this book very interesting and informative, but I'm wondering who is was written for. If 'Sailor Moon' is indeed a show for little girls, I doubt there is a seven-year-old American girl who cares about the Japanese version and Japanese culture. I own all five seasons on DVD with subtitles, so I understand everything mentioned, but a little girl wouldn't, especially if she is not Japanese."
5,An amazing tribute to Takeuchi and Sailor Moon,"This is one of my favorite book. It gives the average Westerner such a great knowledge about not only Sailor Moon, but also about where the show takes place, which is, of course, Japan and their amazing culture. You learn so much about Japan's culture and how Sailor Moon tries to show this to us. Now, whenever I watch other anime shows, I try to find the references that they have to Japanese culture in them. So even if you aren't a huge fan of Sailor Moon, but you love Japanese culture and/or anime/manga, this is still a must read. It makes me want to travel to Japan even more now. I highly recommend it! Great job, Jay and Dr. X! Keep up the good work!"
3,More academic than I expected,"Written with a heavy hand, especially considering the subject matter, this book was quite insightful about Japanese culture, taking lessons learned from Sailor Moon manga."
3,ok but extremely over priced for what it is,"I enjoyed the video but found most of the knowledge discussed to be information readily available in most military manuals. As a former Marine and Army firearms trainer and technician I found it a good review but not really relaying any ""new knowledge."" With that said I do recommend it. But it is overpriced for what it is.I purchased my copy from Paladin Press and was disappointed as it and all their other videos on this subject were recorded at super long play and the grainyness made it difficult to really see all that was presented. There really is no excuse to charge Standard Play rates for Super Long Play videos."
3,Good video,"There is some good information giving out in this video. This is a part two to an earlier video, ""Ultimate Sniper"". The author is kinda monotone, so I would recommend watching it over a period of days because its rather long."
3,doorbell wireless,The door bell sounds nice and looks good. The problem is that the button that's only 10 feet away on the garage wall may or may not transfer the signal to ring the bell. I've changed batteries:replaced the entire button with a different style and finally found yet a different button that does the job. It also lights up at night. So I'd rate it a 3 but would give it a 5 if they would fix the door bell ringer so it actually reaches the advertised 100 feet.
3,ARMED ROBBERY TRAINING MANAUL,"I FOUND THE BOOK VERY SPECIFIC ON WHAT AND WHAT NOT TO DO IN CERTAIN SITUATIONS.THE INFORMATION PROVIDED WILL BE VERY HELPFUL TO ME, AS I AM A BANK TELLER MYSELF."
4,Watercolour Workshop by Robert Wade,"An informative reference for the watercolour artist, The book covers all the essentials for the watercolour artistThe service was good, quick & accurate"
1,I feel ripped off,I ordered and paid top price for a new book. I received a second hand book. I could tell it was second hand because a previous owner had written their name on the inside of the fron cover and this had been covered over with whiteout. The book itself is great but It is no what I ordered and paid premium price for. I look forward to hearing a response.RegardsGreg Young
5,My favorite watercolor book,"I have a library of over 60 watercolor books, and this is by far my favorite. I also own all of Wades's tapes, and his new CD. I find them to be an extension of the book. I took a workshop from a famous watercolor teacher who had us doing wash on top of wash. She must have gotten the idea from Wade as he has a section on just that topic. He covers washes on top of finished paintings that changes the character of the painting completely. A fasinating book that I return to over and over again."
2,"Cheap, but works.","I took off the cap before installing this, and something must have bumped the end, because it looked crushed, the plastic around the plug is very very cheap, but it does work as a cable. BE VERY CAREFUL with this delicate wire. But of course once it is installed it does the job."
2,"Cats love them, but...","My cats all love these, but they're constantly falling apart. (The fish, not the cats.:) I've mended them so many times that there's no more fabric left to mend! I suggest buying the bananas or cigars instead. Those hold up much better!"
1,Buyer Beware!,"This module/software does allows you add your own recipes, but they cannot be synchronized to your handheld. That version is read only. So your getting a cookbook for your visor but it's not your favorite recipes. If I had known this I wouldn't have bought it."
5,I'm so excited,"I have a very old, somewhat tattered, copy of this book, under it's first title, ""Groundsel and Necklaces"". I've had it since I was a little girl in the fifties, and I still love to read it, and have read it to my daughters. It's such a lovely story, and the illustrations are fabulous. I'm really excited to learn that it has been reissued, and I can buy it for the children of friends and relatives. I've always been afraid my book will fall apart, but now I know I can find it again!"
2,An ok book,This book was not what I expected. It was hard to follow and was very wordy. I used this book in my Dysphagia class and I can say that I learned more from the teacher than this book.
2,Unhappy,"I was unhappy with the book. It was to be in ""like new"" condition; however most of the pages were marked up pen and highlighters. I will not be buying a used book again, it was a gift and for a few more $ I could have bought a new one."
3,"For those in doubt, the evil isn't one-sided: a prison movie",A guard and a death row inmate become friends almost by accident.The system has failed badly on this fellow who killed four people.The frying went as scheduled...Death as the revenge of the state seems to be less than enlightened or even Christian?The guard's life goes on.
1,Only Listened to Samples! Wheres the Complex Rhythms?,"Just my two cents worth, the samples seem rather generic does NOT display the artistic talents of these drummers. I still love the GREATS! Buddy Rich Gene Krupa Max Roach Philly Jo Jones Ginger Baker Carl Palmer Bill Bruford Studio drummer Steve Gadd, and a few others I can't think off my head."
5,What a great kit!,"This kit is a great deal for the price. While it serves quite well as a drum mic kit, you also have the option of breaking out the SM57's for other general uses, and the Beta 52 works well on bass cabs. Given that SM57's are still an industry standard for recording and live performance, you really can't go wrong with this kit."
4,Crossan's The Historical Jesus,For my needs this book has way too much detail about the vicinity and times in which Jesus lived. I was hoping for more information about his personal life. Thoroughly researched and unbiased as I find all of Crossan's work.
3,"Lots of information, but verbose and aggravating style","Enjoys holding the reader hostage by introducing a term, but not defining it before dragging you through mountains of material. Example: ""Patron"" appears as a title on p 43. Not defined succinctly until twenty five pages later (and by a different author). Verbose academic piffle with polysyllabic overkill in the meantime, eg: ""...a theory of social stratification as a cross-cultural model for the distributive process in human societies...""Makes you wonder what the guy would yell if the building was burning - it sure wouldn't be ""fire""!"

Verbose academic piffle with polysyllabic overkill in the meantime, eg: ""...a theory of social stratification as a cross-cultural model for the distributive process in human societies..."""
2,Whoa--Too Pedantic,"Maybe I'm just not very smart (I only have 3 degrees) but I had a lot of difficulty with this book. I never did figure out what most of the exhaustive quotes had to do with the Historical Jesus. I guess I thought the author would try to demonstrate that Jesus was a historical figure or else that He wasn't. But if he did it escaped me. He seemed to try very hard to show the reader just how extremely erudite he is--and I have no doubt that he is indeed a very learned man but the constant pedantry just wore me out--he should learn how to simply tell a ""story"". Sorry--the book was a disappointment to me"
2,J.D. Crossan does the impossible,"John D. Crossan has almost done the impossible. He wrote a 600 page book on the subject of the historical Jesus, and almost never mentioned Jesus. There is an extensive portrait of first century Palestine, and a detailed description of the life of a commoner. We learn everything there is to know about Josephus, get the opinion of seventeen different archeologists about what Gallilee was like. But there is no Jesus. It's as if Titian painted the death of Socrates, but left the main character out of the picture. Very disappointing."
1,Disappointing,"What a rip off. I expected to learn about the historical being, Jesus. Instead the author tells me about the whole Mediteranian. He includes miscellaneous material as if to impress me with his knowledge, but I had to read 250 pages of a 500 page book to even have Jesus mentioned. I suggest if you buy this book, use it as a book end. It is not a buy for $14.00. I wish Mr. Crossan had stuck to material on which the book is entitled. The author has written the book to impress himself. He sure will not impress any readers."
1,"Rationalism, Not Scholarship",This book shows little more than Father Crossan's rationalistic biases. These center about an a priori denial of the possibility of miraculous events. The ensuing denial of the authenticity of the Gospels as historical documents then becomes little more than a foregone conclusion.
2,"Good outside, Bad inside","The outside case seems well constructed and looks very good, but inside the individual cd envelopes may be removable by feature but they do not like to stay in on their own accord. Every time I flip through the case one or two fall out."
1,Shipper could care less!,"I was all excited to begin my son's Medical School Year with Really Accurate Body System Plastic Coated Posters. So far, 2 of the 4 posters arrived. To my surprise, rather than the sender packaging them in poster tubes, they arrived All Crumbled in a Box. There are at least 8 deep creases running across each poster, making them useless for display. In addition, spending nearly $80.00 for pure useless garbage reminds me why I'll never order from Amazon again!!!"
4,A great gift for the western-nut,"This book is a walk down memory land for those of us who grew up on western movies. I gave it as a gift to a friend who is truly addicted to westerns. Now if someone would only write a book on the movie horses the stars rode, we'd all be fascinated."
1,"Seriously, Honeywell!? Styrofoam componentry & NO AIR FLOW!?","I have three other Honeywell air filters (I'll put in model numbers later - two of one model and one of another model) and they're all really very good. This one, however, mystifies me because the internal fan cowl is made of styrofoam, and not even high density styrofoam, it's similar to to what the unit came packed in for shipping. Even if that's acceptable on some deranged level of engineering logic (I'm sure management thinks this is just nifty) - the air flow from this thing is pitiful! The smallest honeywell unit I have pushes five times the output on high than this one does on high. This thing is going back, asap. On that note, thanks Amazon for making returns hassle free and easy!!UPDATE:I bought this one instead, it's been working great for 45 days straight on Medium or High.Honeywell 50250-S 99.97% Pure HEPA Round Air Purifier"
1,Piece of garbage.,I've owned this unit for less than a day and I'm already sending it back. It stopped working after about five minutes and will not power back on. Save your money.
2,NOT quiet,"You have to use this at the lowest setting in order for it to be ""quiet"".Our son's allergy problems are better with this in place - even being used at the lowest setting."
2,Expensive sound machine.,"First, it's a pain the rear to clean the black filter. It's not ""hard"", it's just a pain. We have two Honeywell Purifiers, this one, and a smaller one for our boys' bedroom. Neither seems to do anything to improve the air quality. Both boys suffer from allergies, and there is no difference with their unit. My husband and I haven't noticed a difference at all with this unit in our large bedroom.We turn it on ""high"" at night, and it's basically our sound machine. I had such high hopes after all of the great reviews, but it didn't change much for us at all. Wish it had. We also have Sharper Image Ionic Air Cleaning machine, and I've had that for over 10 years, and it STILL works better than this. We use that for our downstairs area, and we're looking for more of that type now."
4,Efficient but big,"This machine does work pretty good at cleaning up the air, but it was a lot larger that I anticipated and for being considered quiet, it wasn't terrible, but it was still noisier than I thought it would be. Comparable in fan noise to a large humidifier. If you have room for it, it did make a difference in a positive way"
3,unreliable switches,"Initially the 4 position switch (off, high, med, low) did not turn the machine off, but the problem was intermittent. Now, after 3 months, the high position does not work. The unit does a satisfactory job even at the medium setting, but it's defective.The unit does collect a lot of dust and dog hair. If you like mild white noise while you sleep it's good, not too loud.Overall, I am disappointed."
3,Works but falls short,Good room air cleaner but limited to about 10 X 8. It runs quietly but does not appear to have as much air flow as I would like and the filters require frequent replacement. I would be happier if the unit was priced around 75.00 for the cost I expected more. It works fine but for the money fails to fully meet my expectations.
2,it's too noisy,"I was happy initial because I don't have to change the filter on Honeywell and is cheaper than Rabbit Air BioGS. I can't stand the noise level even at lowest.I can not work on computer and have it ON. It's good only if you are not in the room.I got 2 years ago ""Rabbit Air BioGS"" - that is very quiet, I could sleep when is turned ON - you can not hear at all, but Rabbit is very expensive over $300 and I paid $55 for a new filter that you have to replace every 18 month. If you intend to stay in the room when is ON - forget about Honeywell. The manufacture and/or amazon should say what is the noise level."
2,Not silent,"Purchased this looking for a silent pruifier for the bedroom. This was suitable for loving room or garage, but not silent enough for a bedroom even on lowest setting. Returned product for credit."
1,High button burned out on the first day,"Only medium and low work. I dont think this was an effective filter, even using the other settings. Instead of exchanging this, I'm just going to return it. Wasn't impressed."
2,dead after few hours,"I purchased this purifier because of its high rating. However, after running it for a few hours, it just suddently stop with no sign of power even though my power outlet is perfectly fine. I tried different outlet but nothing happenned.I also noticed the smell that people have been talking about. The smell is not from the filter but rather from the motor. When the motor is hot it releases an unconfortable burning smell.About the noise, it seems to be quiet although I never have any other purifier before.Now it is going to going back to Amazon."
1,"breaks easily; ""limited warranty"" requires that you pay to fix it","this was a great product, but broke after just two years, emitting a strong burnt odor despite being cleaned regularly. in order to use the warranty, you have to find a huge cardboard box, ship it via insured courier to tennessee, and pay kaz $10 - a total of $60 or so - just so that they can look at it. i don't see the point of a warranty if their defective product requires that the customer spend $60 on a $130 product."
4,Quiet & a lifesaver,"We purchased this for the household because my husband was in the hospital for a severe allergic reaction to a new rabbit we introduced into the house. After cleaning the house & giving the rabbit to a worthy owner, we bought the air purifier to ease our minds & help everyone breathe cleaner air.We noticed a difference in air quality after we kept it running for 15 minutes in our open living room. It is bulky, but it is quiet and seems effective. I highly recommend this product."
4,Nice unit - does the job,"This is on the low end, price-wise, for an air purifier for the room size, but it does a good job. My wife was sneezing like mad due to a shedding dog. This (and a new vacuum cleaner) solved the problem. Quiet and effective. Good unit."
1,Not Even Quiet let alone Silent,"I have no idea whether this product works because the first night we turned it on, on the lowest setting, we lasted about 10 minutes before agreeing it was too loud. It also has an absurdly bright set of LEDs that light up the room."
1,Piece of Junk,I had this on medium for 30 days and it began to howl. Now it howls all the time and it is too loud to run it. For an expensive air cleaner it is cheaply constructed. The inner components are made out of styrofoam the type you see on a disposable beach cooler. Now I have to pay shipping both ways to the manufacturer to have it fixed. Stay away from this air cleaner.
1,Faulty design,"Whomever put my air purifier together must have been drunk. The buttons on the front panel are so depressed, you can't press them with your fingers. I tried using a pencil, and one the the buttons disappeared under the shell! The pieces under the panel don't fit well together and have a huge gap in between them. Upon opening the top, I see that the screws are not aligned with the screw holes. The button panel have fallen into the abyss, and some of the plastic pieces of the shell don't fit well and are at odd angles with each other. I am very disappointed in this product. I believed in the honeywell name, and I feel like I've been given a piece out of their mistake pile. I will stay away from their products from now on!"
2,Quiet? Hardly.,"I guess you all have a different standard of what ""quiet"" means.This thing is really loud. Yes the fans seem to be good quality so you don't hear any mechanical noise at all. The problem is just that even the lowest setting is blowing an awful lot of air, so you hear a ""whooshing"" sound. It's okay during the day, but for sleeping it should really have a lower setting.Also it is very large, about the size of a room air conditioner or mini-fridge.My guess is the sound volume of this thing is in the range of 30-40 dB , and it should be 20-30 dB. For comparison, a good quiet PC fan is in the 10-20 range."
4,BIGGER than expected,"I received the product today, and to my shock it's as tall and round as a short end table or ottoman. I was not expecting furniture, but rather a small appliance - like my mixer or humidifier. As for functionality, I have no complaints. But don't be fooled if you're looking for a discreet air purifier."
2,less than expected,"I'm not sure why this product received so many 5 star reviews. I was sold on this product after reading customer reviews but my experience has been less than expected. I needed an air purifier to reduce tobacco odor in my bedroom but it's not doing its job. I only smoke a couple of cigarettes a day. My friend has one that almost eliminates tabacco odor but it's an ionized air purifier which many reviewers on this web site discouraged me from buying. This product seems to reduce air particles but again you won't be satisfied if you expect to get rid of more than 50-60% of odor/dirt. There was a debate amongst many reviewers about its noise level. My vote is that it should not be called ""Silent Comfort"". It's definitely misleading. It's not too bad if you can have a little fresher air for $130 but you can probably get much more had you invested a little more."
2,Poor Design,"I ordered this in March of this year for my bedroom (a 12x16 room) after my old purifier of 9yrs finally bit the dust.This purifier pulls air in from the bottom and returns it just above the intake vents... it's spinning it's wheels in mud per se.Unless you're sitting beside it or actually sit the purifier on a table to raise it (like we did), it's 'purification' radius is about 2ft.It IS quiet but I miss the soft 'hum' of the old one -a GREAT 'white noise'. I thought cleaning the filter would help but no,it's the design. By the way, you'll need to reverse the directions for cleaning the filter (clean the inside, not the outside).Also, my old one had an ionizer which I prefer... good for seasonal affective disorder.Overall, I wish I would've bought the newer version of my old purifier for half the price."
4,Work well with prefilters.,"This is a rather bulky air purifier that has an advantage of having re-usable HEPA filter. However, although it generated loud noise even under low power setting, it's not as powerful as expected. Its purification efficiency seemed similar to my small non-HEPA air purifier. Compare to a 3M Filtrete airpurifier that I have, this model has similar noise level but less purification efficiency. Perhaps the difference lies in airflow or filter design.[2012] I ended up putting two prefilters on this purifier. They worked well!! Not so quiet but gets the air clean."
4,Good Air filter,"I must warn that this guy is bigger that it looks in the picture, so I would check the size specs. However, it is quiet on the low and medium speeds and really, in my opinion, is not to loud on high. I am happy with this purchase."
2,To Noisy,"Returned item, When the fan was on we couldn't hear the TV. I am sure it does the job it is suppose to do, butI bought it because it was advertize as Silent Tech."
2,Rather disappointed with this one.,"I purchased this to help my son, who has sinus problems. Gets sick frequently with the quality of the air. However with this he isn't getting sick nearly as much. We loved it, and purchased a second unit for the living room. However something went wrong on the inside, and the foam that encases the blade is rubbing on it. I contacted Honeywell, and they sent me to someone else for support, and they said, even under warranty, I would have to pay to ship it, and for repairs. This thing is rather large, and would cost a fair bit to ship it to and from them. Support is more important to me then product, and I am done with Honeywell now."
4,Great system,This machine works really well. One of the people in our home has asthma and this machine really works hard and does a great job at cleaning the air.
2,Honeywell envirocaire Model 18155,"I had this same machine for 7 years and was so happy with it that I bought another. BOY OH BOY This one is nothing but a problem. I think after many years they make them cheaper. Got it home, turned it on--worked good so threw out the box, BUT THEN The High Setting Stopped Working (SILENT)-- It just is not the same!!!! Beware!!!Wish My Old One Was still With me .I would never buy again!!!!!"
4,Honeywell 18155 Air purifier,"This unit works fine, but makes noise during start up, You have to play around tightening the top lead to reduce/eliminate noise."
2,"Worked great first 2 months, then started smelling.","We used this filter in our toddler's room to keep things clean for her allergies. The first 2 months were great, but then a ""moldy"" smell started coming out of the unit. I changed out pre-filters, and vacuum cleaned the HEPA, but those results were fruitless.As a test, I removed the lid and ran the unit so the air exhausted up and away from the HEPA and it smelled great. Closed the lid, and as soon as the air passes the filter it starts smelling. I repeated this without the PRE-filter to make sure and got the same results.Called up Honeywell KAZ, and they offered to replace the unit and not the HEPA filter. I'll be out shipping and no filter device for 2-3 weeks. Bad deal on the sale price I got for the unit. My next recourse would be to find a third party manufacturer of HEPA filters compatible for my unit and try and have luck with that."
3,LOUD on low and also a VERY LARGE MACHINE :(,"This machine arrived and is nearly the size of a window A//C unit! It's massive. My husband asked if it was R2D2. Size aside, it's very loud which is my main complaint. Even on low it's loud. I had a Honeywell years ago that was barely detectable on medium and silent on low. THIS unit is NOT SILENT by any means. If you are hard of hearing then you may believe it's silent on low or medium. It's not quiet enough to be white noise. Either I have super sensitive hearing or the machine is just loud.Only had it a week so not sure what to do....if return is possible -- it's going back."
4,Honeywell 18155 Air Purifier,"Recently purchased two of these units, one for my family room, one for the living room and dinning area. One of the units was faulty, fan did not work. Amazon was great with returning it and sending a new unit out the next day with no additonal charges. Unit is very quiet on low and medium speed, high is a little noisy but very effective. Air in house is much cleaner and it does eliminate odors since we have smokers in the house which was one of the reasons the units were purchased. Unit is a little larger than I expected but rooms they are in are large and can be placed in space out of the way. Really noticed a difference in the air quality. Must say I am very satisfied."
1,Didn't work after 3 weeks usage,The item just didn't work after 3 weeks. I originally got this item for my baby while he sleep since by then we have pollen issue in the neighborhood. Very disappointed at this item. Won't buy this brand again.
2,Anything but silent,Probably an effective and efficient air cleaner. Too soon to know for sure.But it is noisy. Silent setting is anything but. Seller tries hard but notthere yet.
1,Poor Quality,"This unit powered itself off after only running a few minutes after I received it, and would never come back on. I emailed the customer service department and I did receive a prompt and courteous reply. But the unit had to be returned and I did not repurchase."
2,Big Disappointment,"I purchased this item for my 82-year-old mother who is bothered by neighbors' cigarette smoke in her apartment building. I expected she would be able to take it out of the box and plug it in, ready to go. I was very disappointed to hear from her - there are parts to be put together and she needs help from an electrician or electricity-savvy person in order to use the machine. We are still considering returning it for a more user-friendly purifier."
4,Honeywell air purifier,"Product received ahead of schedule. I installed in our bedroom and from the first night it has provided excellent results and my wife, who has numerous allegies, has been able to sleep at night. Only complaint is the size, but then I just didn't look at the footprint when I ordered. I'll be carefull the next one I order.Great product."
1,Strike Two and Your Our,"I received my first unit a couple of weeks ago. The first night I put it on high like instructed. A few hours later I turned it to low. A few hours after that we noticed a smell and pushed the button to turn the machine off. While the unit looked like it was off since all the lights turned off, the fan was still on and was on high. I had to unplug the machine to turn it off. The next morning I plugged it back in and high no longer worked, but the smell was gone and medium, low and off worked. Strike One!I contacted Amazon and got a replacement which I just received. Followed all the directions and let it run on high as instructed. Was curious to see if I would have the same problem, so I turned it to medium, then low and then off. Surprise, surprise, off is not off. Off it high. I had to unplug the unit again to turn it off.I am very disappointed and would not recommend this unit to anyone."
3,Make sure you check the measurements first before ordering,"I have never had an air purifier before but my son developed allergies and I wanted something to have in his bedroom. Someone recommended this model so I ordered it and I didn't realize how huge it was going to be. I normally check the size before ordering anything online, but for some reason I didn't this time. I guess I was expecting something the size of an humidifier but this item is just way to big to keep in a small bedroom, especially if it's recommended to be at least 3 feet from the wall or other furniture. I don't understand - are you just supposed to put it smack center in the room? Anyway, I found some smaller (and cheaper) that is working great and now I'm spending $18 to send this back to Amazon.I never actually took this out of the plastic wrap and turned it on, so I don't know how well it works. That's why I gave it a 3 star rating."
4,Works great but a bit noisy,"I purchased this for my mother in law who smokes in one room of her 3 bedroom home. While the unit does work amazingly well and the house doesn't smell from smoke, the humming and fan blowing can be a bit annoying and loud."
4,Honeywell Air Purifier,This purifier is quiet. It takes quite a while to remove odors from a room and needs to run 24/7. I bought this purifier because of the permanent Hepa Filter. Only used for 2 weeks so far and there isn't much else to report.
2,Stopped working after 2 years,"I was pretty happy with the air purifier for close to two years, but then it died. After checking on the 5 year limited warranty, I discovered it was pretty worthless, and I'd just have to buy a new one. The only bad thing I have to say about it is that I don't think it should require replacement within two years. From what I'm reading in other reviews, that is a very typical lifespan for this product. When I spend $150, I think an air purifier should work for a minimum of four or five years. I'm not a fan of planned obsolescence or of worthless ""warranties"". Most reviews are written within the first couple of weeks, so it's hard to get a sense of whether a product is good quality or not. I'd like to see people come back and review when they've had a product for a year or more."
5,Hepa Air Purifier,"Excelent product, fast ship, it is helping my family as promised. I highly recommend this product as it is so easy to set up and use. There is very little maintenance, it's awesome!"
2,"Lasted 3 years, then died","I bought this to use in my bedroom since I also have a jewelry bench in there to help with some of the excess dust. It's hard to say exactly how effective it was at cleaning the air in the bedroom as I have nothing to compare it to, but it seemed to do a decent job at sucking up dust and pet hair. Eventually I just started turning on every night on high to function as a sound machine as well (I live in Brooklyn, so it was nice to filter out some of the noise from the city and from inside a tiny apartment since I'm often the first one in bed). Unfortunately, after 3 years of use, the motor has just stopped working. From looking at the other reviews it seems worthless to try and pursue any kind of repair, so now I just have this hunk of junk that I have no choice but to send to a landfill. My advice is to spend the extra money on a better quality machine, it'll pay off in the long run."
5,It's great.,"Well No it's not exactly silient, but it's not a roaring 747 eather.The word ""Life Time"" Heppa felter is ok as long as you measure life time by the life span of a house fly.( PS: When the Heppa filter light comes on wash out the filter ,located on the bottom with hot water)But I have two cats in a small apartment and I smoke but you would neaver know it."
3,"This is ok, I like the other honeywell better because","the permanent filter on this one is 2 "" the other on model 50250-s has one l/2 as tall as the unit is. 3 speeds to make the noise not as loud"
1,Junk,This item is complete junk. Doesn't even keep the air fresh and it has a funky smell to it that i cant get over.
4,"Ain't decorative, but it works","Works reasonably well. Definitely not small, but works better than other, more streamlined air purifiers I have bought in the past."
3,Broke 11 months after I bought it.,"I adopted 2 cats and need air purifiers for each room, I bought several different types including this one. It was veryquiet but compared to my Honeywell model 17000; this unit just didn't seem to trap and much dust/dander. It stopped working ( would not power on) after 11 months. I would not buy this again."
4,I'm very pleased!,"After running this unit for just one week I've noticed a great reduction in dust from our fireplace which used to settle on everything. We have it sitting very close to our TV but it runs very quietly - even on high - and doesn't interfere with the volume on the TV.The only reason I did not give it five stars is because it has a pre-filter I was unaware of which has to be replaced several times a year. At $15 each that could add up quickly. However, I purchased a smaller Honeywell unit for the bedroom which also has a pre-filter and the instructions say that it can be rinsed and air dried so I don't see why I can't do the same with this one.All things considered, I'm very happy with this unit."
3,"Runs fine, but...","This purifier is quite during the low setting. The high setting cranks out the power. My only gripe is that you can't put this on an automatic timer. If you do, one the timer shuts off the unit, the unit will not turn back on once the timer comes back on...you have to manuualy turn on the unit. It was delivered within 5 days. It's also lightweight and can be moved from room to room easiely."
4,"so far, so good","I've been using my air purifier in my classroom for the past month and have not had any problems so far. As mentioned in other reviews, this machine does take up some space. The low setting is not very loud. More like a quiet hum. The highest setting is noticeable and not so ""silent"", but it is do-able."
4,Seems to work great,"Been plugging away for two weeks now, has really made a difference in cutting down the dust. Loses one star since the status light bleeds down into the change-filter light enough to make it unclear if the filter light is on or not."
4,Great product!!!,"After recieving this product, ease of setup is extremely good. We have 2 cats, a dog, and 2 birds in our apartment. I have allergies. The air quality has improved in a MAJOR way. I haven't had nearlly the congestion and irritation from airborne allergens since plugging this thing in. Very happy with the purchase!!! My only complaint is the fact that the coverage area is not wide enough. After having said that, for the price... I'm still happy and it has made a dramatic improvment. Shipping was fast."
2,"Haven't used it yet, but came with wrong pre-filter","This is a partial review: I have no experience with the product yet, but wanted to note that mine came with the wrong pre-filter. It's supposed to be a 38002; the one this came with is super-small (like an inch or so ""tall"") and obviously does not cover the HEPA filter."
