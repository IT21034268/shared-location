1,"bad,too small,dangerous","this tank is too small for any fish.when I see my fish swim by the furniture I think about how it is so sharp that I think the fish will get stabbed by the furniture and all his guts will start leaking out like a water fausit.why waste money on this cheap peace of plastic when you can go to walmart and get a 10 gallon aquarium including a filter,a light fixture,and water conditioner for just 35 dollars?if you think that is to much then they also sell an empty 10 gallon(doesnt include anything)for only ten dollars."
1,"A very cruel fish ""cup""",This tiny tank is simply too small for any fish to live happily. The sharp plastic toys in the tank can easily tear his fins and cause infection. Please do not buy this product.
3,cross references,this book should be cross-referenced in addition to Fiction and War - please add Vercors and French Resistance. thank you
5,DOPE!,this is a sick album. the beats are bangin'. i can't believe no one has reviewed this yet. production is pretty slick and the lyrics are pretty on point.
2,Arendt and Jaspers on Rahel,"This book should be read in conjunction with the Arendt-Jaspers correspondence and her correspondence with her second husband, Heinrich Bluecher."
5,Impressive Brass Hardware,"I purchased this product to replace one that had lost it's luster. Glad I did. This product is made very well, was easy to install, and after more than a year still looks new."
2,Disappointed,I have been disappointed by this dvd. The routines go so slowly I get bored and can't even finish one. And the film quality is poor. I expected a more modern looking set. Try a different dvd!
1,not for anyone who has any physical fitness or has practiced yoga,This is perhaps the worst prenatal workout I have ever done. It seemed so promising but it is not for anyone who is looking to actually practice yoga.I was unable to get through any of the workouts because I was so bored. I feel as if this would be a great workout for a woman in her late 90's who has decided to try yoga for the first time in her life. I have yet to find a good prenatal yoga workout dvd but two that are all OK are Crunch Yoga Mama & Prenatal Pilates with Lizbeth Garcia.
1,"too slow, and has no flow!","I'm no where close to a yoga expert, but I have take a few classes. That said, this dvd was very frustrating for me. They take SO much time over explaining the poses that there is no time to really relax into them. Plus, the poses do not flow together (which to me is one of the most important aspects of yoga). The whole dvd is very ""stop and start"" and really too easy. The modifications for the 1st trimester portion are almost completely unnecessary, as well as many in the 2nd trimester portion."
1,Not worth it!,"I would say that I am at an intermediate level of yoga and in my first trimester, and I did not find this dvd helpful at all. The poses are very simple, but I didn't find much of a stretch in them. The biggest problem is that they jump from one pose to another without any transition. One second you are up against a wall standing, freezeframe switch screens, and the next second you are sitting in the middle of your mat. I was constantly stopping the dvd, moving all of the stuff and repositioning every few minutes. Also, there were way too many props needed: mat, 2 blocks, 2 rolled blankets or pillows, chair, etc. I got more of a stretch and workout from moving all of the props around inbetween each pose. Very disappointed!I also bought Sara Holliday's Prenatal Yoga First Trimester, and I really enjoy it. There is a natural flow between poses with good stretch and just the right amount of intensity for my first trimester."
2,Not clear on instructions and items needed,"I just got this video, and don't like it for a number of reasons. First, the yoga studio is old and really gross, it looks like a moldy basement. For some reason I think Yoga is more relaxing in an open, fresh and clean atmosphere. The photo on the front is certainly deceiving! The other huge problem is that you have to do most of these poses up next to a wall, which I don't have. I read the instructions closely before buying, and you do need a few things like a blanket, etc. I have all that, but no wall! It is annoying. Now I can't use the DVD at all. Almost all the routines are the same but in different orders. Not my favorite to say the least."
2,I don't do much yoga,I'm not too sure about yoga but i have a hard time with this dvd. It's too slow for me and it doesn't transition smoothly from one pose to the next. I feel there are too many props needed.
1,Awful!,"Please don't waste your money on this DVD, it's really awful! I can't even watch it, the place is horrible, dark, with a piano and candles in the middle of a living room worthy of an Agatha Christie's tales of a crime scene, not for a expecting mom doing yoga! There's not a inch of a yoga ambient!. There's tons of others good yoga DVD's for pregnancy, listen to the reviews (I didnt!) and don't waste your money in vain. I bought it because it was cheap, the case was fine and last for 2 hours but please don't make the same mistake!. Helping you is my only comfort because it can't be return once is opened."
2,Not for beginner yoga pregnant women,"This product, in my opinion, is not for beginner yoga - pregnant women. The dvd has difficult and extreme stretching for a pregnant women."
2,dont like this dvd,"I don't like this dvd, many routines have the same poses. I am not experiencing morning sickness, But some of their rountines made me nauseous. I really don't recommend this one."
2,Didn't like this DVD,"I only used this twice during my pregnancy. First of all you need other equipment such as blocks and bands that don't come with the dvd. Second, it goes waaaay too slow, even for a preggo! The instructor isn't pregnant, which to me would have made more sense. I'd feel more like ""Hey, she's pregnant and she can do this so I can too."" I didn't like this dvd at all. But to be fair, I didn't really give it much of a chance. I preferred the Prenatal Pilates DVD's much more and used them frequently."
5,Fun Gift,What a fun gift! We play guitar so it was very easy to pick up and play. So portable and it sounds great.
5,Wonderful recordings by a brilliant pianist!,"Radu Lupu is a truly great artist. It is an awful shame that this CD (along with most others in this series, ""Great Pianists of the Twentieth Century"") is now out-of-print. Lupu's playing on Beethoven's 32 Variations in C minor is the best I've heard (though for some reason the piece is not recorded nearly enough; it has all the pathos and dramatic intensity of the great Beethoven minor key piano sonatas). On the Brahms Intermezzi Lupu's playing radiates a tender beauty and he makes the Brahms ""Theme and Variations"" seem the equal of the Sextet andante from which it was transcribed. But perhaps the true gem on this CD-set is the adagio from the Grieg Piano Concerto: Lupu's playing is so elegant here that the orchestra seems almost unnecessary.Lupu's recording of the eight Schubert Impromptus is also wonderful."
2,"Mastering ""Try to find something worthwhile in this book""","I am a professional programmer and purchased this book to develop COBOL programs on my desktop. The book contains tons of information on COBOL, but virtually NONE on how to use the included software. There are several good pieces of software included on the cd (Crystal Reports, 2 different GUI-COBOL interfaces) but, again, very little documentation on how to use them. My advice: Buy Sams ""COBOL in 24 Hours"" (which includes the Fujitsu V3 COBOL compiler)and download the free COBOL compiler from the Fujitsu website. I learn quicker with the ""Let's build an application"" approach that Sams uses. Good luck."
2,Disappointed,"I use COBOL at work and I'm sure the book is comprehensive, but I bought it mainly for the compiler. With close to 1,000 pages I think its a disservice that so little of the book is devoted to using the compiler. Instead of coding I'm experimenting with a byzantine piece of software to deduce how to use it. To add injury to insult I was looking for a ""how to"" book for the compiler and found I could've saved $10.00 if I had bought it at amazon."
5,You are going to love this book.,"I use this book as a reference when I do dental education for all of our county's K and 3rd graders. It allows us to discuss the tooth fairy (children love that) and cultural diversity. While talking about the tooth fairy, we are allowed to discuss that while we may celebrate life events differently, we are all the same, regardless of our skin color or where we live. Buy this book for your children, your grand children, and your friend's children. You will love this book."
4,Throw Your Tooth on the Roof,"My 6 year old grandson, Evan, and I took turns reading, questioning, and laughing as we turned the pages of this interesting and enlightening little book. We had some light conversation and lots of laughs about what parents (and grandparents) in our culture and parents in other cultures tell their children when the first tooth is lost. Evan wanted to know why such a ""common"" experience caused such a variety of responses. And, why parents had to make up stories in the first place. Well now, that's a good question!"
5,Delightful!!!,As a pediatric dentist I have enjoyed sharing this delightful book with parents and children in our practice.
5,A great book for children of all ages.,This is a fun book for all children. It raises awareness of traditions from different cultures. With older children you can look at themes behind the custom.
5,Way better than expected!,"I have and utilize a Powerline network at home consisting of mostly Netgear XE103's but wanted to add a WAP to this as my previous coverage was spotty. All I have to say is thanks Trendnet for making this product! This seems to be much more robust than the Netgear powerline adapters and when I look in my network manager software, this wireless unit connects at 54mbps, which is MUCH better than the average 9-11mbps for the Netgear XE103's on this network. In the future, I will be buying Trendnet adapters instead of Netgear."
2,"Poor speed, needs to be on same circuit breaker","Like I mentioned in my other review of the Trendnet powerline ethernet adapter (to which this access point connects to) it needs to be on the same electrical circuit breaker. That's a very bad restriction to have. Most houses have 10-15 breakers, and it's very rare that your application will fins the router/adapter and the access point on the same breaker.In sum, I get a dismal 1.05 Mbps speed. Not catastrophic, but pretty poor result for a 130$ (adapter+AP price) investment."
3,Gray Hawk's Lady: Blackfood Warrior,"Interesting a little, hard to follow, facts were interesting on the blackfoot indians, not the best it was okay thank you"
2,Horribly written,"This was elementary writing that needed some serious editing. Point of view problems, weak, predictable plot, uninteresting characters. Repetition. Overall a very disappointing read and I had looked forward to getting some of the author's other Native American romances. Won't happen now."
1,Whine Whine,"The whining drunk shows his true colors. Should have been off the air at least 10 years before they finally showed him the door. What a low-life ... if you're broke, it's your fault. And, if you lost the Masters vs. Arnie, it's because you didn't play well enough to win."
5,Quality You Can Trust,"If it is from GE, you can really have a value for your money.The best quality in a budget price, maybe because it is made in China, but what the heck...it serves its purpose!"
3,What are the item's dimensions?,"There are HUNDREDS of this type of storage unit on here, and NONE of them says how wide, how deep and how tall it is! Am I supposed to GUESS? Well, I GUESS I won't buy one, because it has to fit into a prescribed area, and if it's 10"" or 11"" or even 13"" wide, it would fit just fine and I would buy it. But, if it's, say, 13.5"" wide, it's useless to me and I will just have to be sent back, which is a hassle for everyone involved.So, PLEASE, put the DIMENSIONS somewhere PROMINENT in the item's description? One of these units even said that it's size was ""yellow"".Um...."
3,Make sure you try it at store first before order few boxes!,I love about half of yogi tea's and the rest I hate. Be sure you try these or you will have few boxes of tea just sitting there. The taste of two flavor is this box I just can't drink. The taste is so strong that you can't add anything to mask.
1,Last review has a mistake,"Hi! I just want to say, that I bought this movie (cover like the picture on the top of this page), and it's not about any helicopter action. It was a boring movie with a lot of talk and card game.Deadly Encounter by William Graham (1982)(Aslo known as American Eagle) -This is the one with a helicopter action. I have seen that this movie and it was great. (...)"
1,A painful example of how not to shoot a film,"Don't bother with this painfully awful example of poor craftsmanship, unless you really like to laugh at the campy effects, bad acting and lack of real storytelling."
1,You will lose this!,"The Jump Drive worked great, but unfortunately the seam of the rubber key chain case was very weak and broke within a month (making it impossible to keep on your key chain). As a result, it just floated freely in my pocket, typically falling out when I pulled my keys out of my pocket. So within a month I had lost it. Lexar support was no help at all--I emailed them to try to buy a new key chain, and they didn't even read my email...just saw the word ""buy"" I guess, and directed me to their on-line store. But you can't buy just the key chain at the store (which makes no sense to me, especially since they are very low quality and break so quickly). I'm having to give this a 1-star, because without a functioning key chain, the drive is useless (as its portability and ""always on you"" feature is what makes it valuable)."
4,Stong singer/songwriter,"I just chanced across this artist and was very pleased with what I heard. Strong vocals and a good, strong sense of songwriting. There were a couple of tracks that I had to look twice at because I was convinced they had to be Jim Steinman songs--but no. They're Tate's. Excellent CD to add to your collection."
4,Better than the Original,"After trying the original Squeeze workout (and not liking it), I was pleasantly surprised with this one. Mostly, because heavier weights are used adding intensity and the whole setup makes more sense (no roof top scenes, thank goodness). It is by no means as good as the other reviewers say, there are better DVDs out there, but it's pretty good. I would compare it to Tamilee's I Want That Body - 2 to 3 sets of supersets. I also found Tracy's body very inspiring and instructions/cueing great. What I didn't like was the music (strange instrumental, loud and obnoxious) and her heavy breathing the entire time. Yes, you will be sweating, but you will not be out of breath, there is an absolute minimal aerobic element if at all, especially during stretching (weird). 4 stars from me."
3,Not as good as I thought it would be,"I like to exercise at home as it saves me time so I can squeeze it (no pun intended). I thought this would be a high quality, weights based exercise with some resistance training, pilates, lotte berk type exercise for nice lean muscles.It's OK, and it's certainly a pleasant video. However, the cuing is awful and I haven't a clue why she's doing so many of these exercises so quickly--especially the ones that become ""jerky"". Having done pilates one on one back in the day when I had time for that and having done all the lotte berk workouts, I was shocked to see some of these same movements done with no effective teaching/cuing and at a rapid speed which frankly seems undesirable under the best conditions but at home, by yourself, most likely without a mirror? Recipe for disaster!I think the focus, types of exercises, amount etc is quite good. The execution really should be improved."
2,Enough with the squeeze,I am advanced exerciser and did not find this workout that challenging or fun. Too much talking and too much squeezing. I was more annoyed than anything.
5,Great All Over Work Out,This is a really good tape to get a full body work out. Great moves that I have never done. And I like her high reps to exhaustion. It transforms your body.
1,Absurdly Bad: An Assault on the Written Word,"This book is a very long commercial advertisement. People say ""pop-culture references""? Try to swallow this line: ""Carson's Motorola Timeport two-way smart pager beeped."" As a writer myself this is an insult to everything I hold dear, and at least for this gay man, ""everything I hold dear"" does not mean the latest pair of Prada shoes."
2,meh...,"You know, I'm all for the occassional fun, easy read where you need not think much. And in that area, this book does a decent job. I will say, some of it just comes off as entirely unbelievable and not all that clever. But I'm willing to overlook that and the fact that this Sex & The City knock-off didn't even have four original careers for the characters. My major grievance with it is the ceaseless product placement. There are so many better ways of describing a pair of shoes, a suit, or a wrist watch than the brand name. All that name dropping as an alternative to actual description is just lazy writing. If no one has told John Jeffrey this, someone ought to. I considered counting each mention of a designer, but even at ~200 pages, that's just too much work in this case. I'd be more upset about paying for the book if I hadn't gotten it half price at a used book store."
5,Zoot and Jimmy never better,"As a lover of Zoots playing since I'm a kid I can only say that this is the man at his most comfortable and swinging best. Jimmy Rowles, Mousey Alexander and George Mraz are perfect cats for the masters voice at its most beautiful.Zoot never felt the need to keep up with trends or""what was happening"" he just knew how to swing,and thats what he did. Boy, do we miss him. Alan Satz"
5,It does not get any better than this.,We are lucky to have had these two beautiful musicians grace our lives. Jazz music does not get any better than this. Essential to any Jazz collection. 10 stars!
5,A classic,"This is music that satisfies the ear, that takes you away (for awhile) from this bad news saturated world."
4,Bernard Lewis,This is a surprisingly lucid and ease to read text considering the subject that is being handled. the author takes the reader with exceptional ease through the rise of Islam and the history of the religion.This is a good read for someone who wants to know more on the subject in simple and clear words.
2,What Went Wrong? This Book f.e.,"In 1999 Professor Lewis held a series of three lectures in Vienna and the transcripts form the backbone of this book. It contains some interesting details about the impression Ottoman Turkey got from its contacts with the West and its response. It is a story of failed reforms and some thoughts about the different perspective the Muslim world has in measuring time and distance.What is not there is the answer to the question put in the title. What went wrong? No idea, but hey, the Muslim world asks this question too. So if you are not particularly interested in Ottoman Turkey and its effort to reform itself better buy another book"
4,"1000 years, one unanswered question","For those of us with a contemporary American attention span, but the willingness to concentrate for its entire duration this book provides a facinating - if concise - view of the affect of modern European history on the great Islamic ( specifically Ottoman ) empire. Contrary to the objections of others, I don't feel it was Lewis' intention to answer the question that forms the title of this book. I think instead his object was to point out the events that led to the formulation of this question ""What went wrong"" as the crux of Islamic scholasticism. The book left me wanting more detailed information as it should, being at best a overview of many years of historical influnces between the Christian west and the Muslim middle-east. As such the book was a good read and much more palitable to a layman, or someone first approaching the subject ( as I was ) than the formidable multi-volume collection that could have - an most likely has been - accounted on the subject."
3,A Decent Historical Account,"In this book Lewis offers a historical account of the interaction between Muslim and western cultures from a Muslim perspective. Most of the book consists of a detailed account of the Ottoman Empire throughout the ages and its response to a real and growing economic, military and cultural gap between the Empire and its western rivals.The book is very informative and mildly enjoyable, however as others have pointed out, it does not even attempt to answer the question raised in the title. Lewis takes a descriptive approach, describing the long and slow deterioration of Muslim civilization, but he does very little to explain the ultimate causes for this deterioration. Why is it that the Muslim world began its decline in the first place? The book provides no insight on the subject. Having said all this, the book is well researched, informative and is a good primer for anyone not too familiar with the history and culture of the Middle East."
3,Makes many little observations; misses one huge one,"It's strange that such an eminent authority on history can become so lost when considering the history of ideas. Lewis mentions many tangential issues as possibly contributing to the decline of the once great Islamic civilization, from sexism (as though the West never had that) to timekeeping to Western classical music. Yet he never mentions a key idea that explains so much of Islamic intellectual history -- ijtihad, the reasoned interpretation of Islamic law to cover modern situations. When the gate of ijtihad was open, as Muslims put it, Islamic civilization flourished. The closing of that gate has been considered the beginning of the end. Yet Lewis never mentions it.He seems almost as lost with regard to the history of ideas in the West. Twice he says that the French Revolution was the first major movement of ideas in the West that was expicitly non-Christian. What does he make of the Enlightenment?"
2,Disappointed,"I guess I didn't read the title carefully. Technically the book says ""what"" went wrong, e.g. the Arabs and Turks lost a lot of battles despite how hard they tried to adapt. What I really wanted to know is ""Why it went wrong."" Why did western civilization florish while Arab civilization disintegrated? The book does nothing to answer this question."
3,The book does not answer its own question,"""What Went Wrong?"" is a very quick read and contains a few interesting statements, such as its statement that the non-fossil fuel exports of the entire Arab world are approximately equal to those of Finland. The book could be a reasonable history of European-Moslem interactions for the new student of history, although the author presents the Moslem world and Islam itself in the most positive possible light, to the point of inaccuracy. However, the author fails to even attempt to answer his own question as to what went wrong. His comparisons of the Islamic world to its contemporaries betrays his ignorance regarding those contemporaries. Still, there are a few tidbits worth knowing in the book, and it takes no time at all to read. Recommended if you can't think of anything better to do."
1,living historians?,"Lewis has the knowledge of languages and the experience to be a great historian of the Middle East. He has written many books, all alike in their viewpoint. If you agree with his ideology, then you like his books. If you know the Middle East, then you know that they are very very biased. He has been known to leave out material that he does not wish to wreck his arguments. For an astonishing omission of well known facts, see the New Yorker of last October, which asserts that no country ever considered Afghistan worth invading. The British fought 4 wars in the 19th century.The list could go on . . . ."
2,And what's the answer to the question?,"The book is mostly just a descriptive history of the Middle East (and mostly about the Ottoman Empire). What is missing is some analysis and especially some attempt to answer the question ""What went wrong""."
1,A dismal book,"This is an extraordinarily badly written -- and bad tempered -- book which is mainly about Turkey rather than 'the Middle East' more generally. Many of its chapters are insubstantial, bottom drawer stuff, with leaps from one rag-bag topic to another without any coherent intellectual argument to pin them together. The book is also astonishingly one-sided: 'what went wrong' -- a bizarre and patronising concept in itself -- is laid entirely at the door of Lewis's version of 'the Orient' and there is no rational critique of European and American imperial and colonial engagements with its various peoples. Fortunately there are many other books which provide much better critical discussions of the political cultures of the region. At the (welcome) end of this tired polemic I was left with only one question: How is it possible for a man to devote so much of his life studying a culture for which he has such visceral contempt?"
1,OLD STUFF,"This is a very disappointing book. It is an anthology of old lectures going all the way back into the 1980s. The material is disjointed with much redundancy. The flow of the text is that of speech and has none of the tigntness and precision normally attributed to the written word. Only the last and short chapter deals with the subject of ""What Went Wrong?"" (Text that was published as a magazine article.) And, the answer to the question is ""Who knows?"" This books will add somewhere between ""very little to nothing"" to the readers understanding of the Mid-East situation."
2,ok,"The subject matter is very interesting, the quality of the book is ok,pages a bit yellow, a little musty - but then again, I paid .98 cents for it, so no gripes."
1,Disappointed,"The book did not answer the question ""What Went Wrong?"" I felt like a committee wrote the book. Many interesting facts which offered no answers or very little insight to understanding the difficulties in the Mideast. I also felt there was a bias against Christians. Sorry I wasted my time plowing through this book."
2,Doesn't answer the question,"This book does not live up to its provocative title. It never addresses the question head on. While not a bad read, it is largely a rehash of parts of Lewis' earlier ""The Middle East"" -- not surprising since ""What Went Wrong"" is based on a lecture series Lewis gave. If you have not read ""The Middle East"" -- get that instead as it is a better book. If you have read it, you may not want to bother with this one unless you want a refresher."
1,DON'T BOTHER,"This is yet another book rushed into publication to capitalize on a hot topic. I read the book as carefully as I could and thought it was a pointless recitation of facts. The only thing I can remember that went wrong is the opppressed half of the Arab population, women, can't contribute to society."
1,... by apologist for Turkish government,Bernard Lewis is known in academic circles to take the view point of the Turkish government as he has throughout his career been the recipient of generous grants from the Turkish gov't. I would not recommend his book for those expecting to find objective history about the Ottoman Turkish Empire.
1,Not taking sufficient Western responsibility,"Bernard Lewis's book is an exercise in blameshifting away from the West and towards the Middle East. He rightly points out Arab responsibility in reaching the current situation, but uses his substantial knowledge to understate the importance and influence of the West in shaping the current and recent political make-up of the region. His description of religious rigidity is overexaggerated and he seems unaware both of the substantial amount of critical Islamic scholars present in the Middle East and the limited influence of religious law in practice in most 'Islamic' countries. His regular thesis of Arab 'rage' and disappointment over lost status is part of an easy thesis that tries to partially simplify the Middle East-West tension to hysterical psychological undervelopment on the part of the Arabs. For people interested in finding out about violent forms of minority muslim fundamentalism, this is a particular bad read."
1,Blame the Victim,"Bernard Lewis very subtly blames the Muslim World thatit is not like the West, and ignores Western aggressionfor the past 400 years. If you read his works, be carefulto think critically about them."
1,horrible book,Blatent misinformation. This is an embarrasing front to cover the dirty hands of the Turkish government. I am embarrased that this book is even listed here.
2,One sided Westren View,"Bernard Lewis does a hard job of interpreting the decline of Muslim civilization through the lens of historyBut he has failed at many places like prejudice and narrow minded western historian.He is correct when he blames the Muslims for the present mess, and fails totally to see how the westerners in 19th and 20th centuries pushed them in present plight and more clearly how the then British pushed them after first world war and how the Americans exploited, the situation to fight the proxy war with communism fanning the internal disputes and propping the poppet regimes suppressive to the local people and crushing the peoples movement in Muslim land.The vision of Mr. Lewis is the vision of people who wears all the time green glasses and sees green forgetting the colors. The book is good one sided western view."
3,A partial answer to an important question,This book would have benefited from a more aggressive rewrite. It does not flow smoothly due to the anthologized structure from prior writings. The reader is left to reach too many conclusions on his own. There is a rich supply of specific examples of both good and bad aspects of pre-20th century Islam civilization. Reliance on the strict moral and civil code of the Koran is demonstrated to have inhibited assimilation with and adoption of the best of Western technologic and social development. Lewis contrasts that attitude with that of the Far East where Western-inspired economic growth has propelled them past the Middle East in a single generation. This is an important book by a man of great knowledge and experience. I think it could have been much better.
1,"A disappointing book, very little substance to it","Luckily this book is only 160 pages, so I didn't waste too much time. It merely says Islamic countries used to be world-leaders, and now they're pretty backward. Very few examples of why and how this happened.I thought it was going to be a history of Islam, but it's more a history of Islamic nations. It's sketchy, it's theoretical, and there's little filled in the middle of the ideas.It'll say things like, ""Modernity came from Christendom during the 18th and 19th centuries and changed the very way life was lived in Islamic countries."" Then it gives no examples of what it means by that.I applaud people who want to learn about Islam, but I recommend they buy a different book than this one."
3,Very Good Information but......,"I really enjoyed reading about the history of the Middle East, the Islamic influence in the region and its propagation, as well as Mr. Lewis' view of how Islam ultilmatly took Middle Easterners down a path that lagged them behind the rest of the world. The problem is, it's tough to stay interested in a book when it presents a question and answers it in the first couple of chapters. Additionally, as I learned upon conclusion of the book, this book is simply a compilation of Mr. Lewis' speaking engagements on this subject. The editor should have done a better job with organization it would keep the readers' interest higher."
5,B.Lewis is the best historical analyzer.The book is perfect.,"I personally like the style of Bernard Lewis alot. I have listened to his TV Interviews. He delivers his point cyrstal clear. He is the best Historian in our lifetime, and the reason for that is his objectivity. He loves every nation and every culture, at least this is the feeling I get from his books and speeches.I personally found ""The Assassins: A Radical Sect In Islam"" harder to read than ""What Went Wrong"". This book is really very easy to read, and it is still very artistic to my belief. I enjoyed it, but it lasted so short."
3,An average book,"As a prior reviewer states, this book is disjointed as one would expect from a book based upon a series of lectures. There are certainly some important themes discussed in this book which are particularly pertinent today. However these issues are not discussed in the depth that they deserve. The fundamental questions of the lack of development of secular institutions in the Middle East and the lack of intellectual freedom are not answered. Instead, the book amounts to a collection of vignettes of the cultural interactions between East and West. Overall, the book is not worthy of the hype which it has received."
3,"Terrific insights, but a little disorganized","What went wrong? Church and state never separated, as they did in the West, and it may well be too late. Buy this book, by all means, if you're looking for a calm, accessible, centuries-long view of the world of Islam and how east and west found themselves so far apart in understanding. It's even a fairly quick read. But to be honest, it's a bit of a mishmash, clumsily structured and oddly organized. His historic details are fascinating, but they end up burying many of the points he's trying to make."
3,Informative But Hard Work,"The book reads like a series of academic lectures patched together--Lewis jumps around. It is certainly not a light summer read--a pity as Westerners could profit from Lewis's expertise. A good editor would have made the lessons more comprehensible. Hope American statemen and Bush (yes, mutually exclusive) are studying these same issues since after reading the book and understanding how deep the gulf is between the two worlds, it is apparent that shoving democracy and Westernization down Islam's throat is a recipe for disaster."
3,Just Ottoman history,I can consider this book to be objective enough on Ottoman history which one cannot find in Turkey and not easy in western world. But i believe that the things were not right for Islam even before Ottomans started their enterprise. Islam stopped its development around 1000-1100-1200 which was not felt in Islamic societies that much because there was no power to compete with Islamic empires at the time. After that it was a stasis for the world. So the question is right but the answer is not in the Ottoman history. Last note is that If you are looking a thorough work on Turkish history read the emergence of Modern Turkey. This book has a lot of repeated information from that book.
2,Disappointing,"Unfortunately, only the last 10 pages of this book actually try to answer the question, ""What went wrong?"" The first 150 pages is a scattered history of Western influence in the Middle East, which jumps around between the 15th and 18th centuries, and doesn't deal at all with the last century, until the last chapter. This book will inform you on Middle Eastern culture, but spends more time talking about subjects such as Western influence on Middle Eastern architecture than on what has gone wrong. If you are an average person like me who is hoping to learn more about why the Arab world is the way it is today in order to better understand the current problems in that region, this book will not do much for you."
2,What Went Wrong,"I have read 4 or 5 of Lewis's recent books, and this book like his others are scholarly , but not written to the average audience.Let's face it, he can't write a compelling story nor a page turner. Lewis writes facts as a Professor would, not as a talented author of novels the public desires on this topic.Lewis needs to Co-Author books with someone that can write a coherent story line.The audience of Lewis is vast, but he writes to scholars not the average reader. So I am always underwelmed and wonder ""What did I just read?"
2,racist,Most of this book focuses on how muslims must be mad because their civilization has been defeated by the West. This is a kind of racist argument with little logical tought involved.
1,Not Objective,"I don't believe this book is completely based on true facts. Unfortunately, I found some prejiduces and subjective thouhgts."
3,This book doesn't tell you what went wrong . . .,"In the classic modality of the academic, the author lays out the history and builds up the complexities of East/West relations . . . BUT . . . does not tell us or even adequately HINT at what went wrong. Other than to say, in effect, ""never the twain shall meet."" Not good enough -- and yet, if you're looking for a brief overview of history, there's no question this book will give it to you. And so, with a different (and if it had aless presumptuous title) it serves a worthwhile purpose."
1,"""What Went Wrong""-you still won't know","I found this a very disapointing book. Perhaps I was spoiled by having recently read Milton Viorst's ""Sandcastles"" that goes over much of the same historical background, but in far greater depth. In any case, I found Mr. Lewis' book to be at best on the Jr High School level in his historical overviews. And then, dispite the teaser of the title, he never does get around to offering any real insights into the situation. The best I could say about this book is that for a reader with no background in the Middle East at all, it might at least provide a useful primer."
1,What went wrong with this book?,Mr. Lewis provides no answer to the question 'What went wrong'. None. Not even some guesses.Book is filled with mildly interested anecdotes of Turkish history.Save your money for something else.
3,Intriguing but Incomplete,"I bought this book hoping to gain a little perspective on the history of bad blood between the Arab world and the West, in order to quell any possible doubts about the obvious givens - that the Arab world is vastly inferior and Islam has not been kind to it in modern times. While the book offers some very interesting examples from the author's scholarship, they are scattered in the midst of fragmented ideas. The book is brief, and seems more like a stapled collection of historical sketches (taken from lecture notes) than a completely coherent analysis of a complex phenomenon. The summary at the end comes like a payoff, but it does not come at a logical time, cutting off the flow of the argument. Furthermore, it seems like many of these ideas are rehashed, lacking the enthusiastic voice of original scholarship. However, I will give it the benefit of the doubt for being well-intentioned and holding the right opinions."
2,What went wrong indeed.,"If you are looking to learn what went wrong between the Judeo/ Christian world and the Muslim world, I would recommend that you look at sources other than Dr. Lewis' book. After 160 pages,the author never does really answer his question in the title. It may have been this, it may have been that. Unfortunately, before he gets to this soft conclusion he subjects the reader to a really long trek through Middle Eastern ancient history. Intersstingly, he doesn't say much of anything about World Wat I and the defeat of Turkey. The author acknowedeges that the book is built around a few lectures he gave. I think thi book is on the Best Sellers list only because of 9/11. It's an ill wind that doesn't blow someone some good. Two stars at the absolute best."
5,Prescient History,"Based on two earlier works by Dr. Lewis, the present volume was updated through the Global War on Terror. The title question is from the perspective of the Islamic World and the change in the relative world positions of the Islamic and Christian worlds since the 13th century. The conclusion, added for this edition, establishes the foundation for the ongoing Arab Spring. It is a model of powerful reasoning, based on a deep historical knowledge of the people and their culture, that leads to the future. Powerful read, required to understand our world and the ongoing events of the Middle East."
2,Misleading Title,"Much of what we dislike about about standard high school history classes is found here. I kept hoping for explanations of the decline, only to be buried by more names, dates and medieval middle eastern minutae."
3,He Doesn't Know,"I trust Lewis' credentials, but he does not answer the question in ""What Went Wrong."" After a couple hundred pages, I get the impression that it had something to do with the Ottoman Empire. After all, for 400 years Constantinople made no effort to decentralize its absolute authority over Middle East colonies, nor to develop their economies. I guess after centuries of lassitude and imperialist interference, the former intellectual glories of Arabia were buried.But what about since 1917? Russia, Japan, and America all rose to become new world powers; the Arabs did not. Lewis does not supply a credible explanation for this.If you read Patai's ""The Arab Mind"" you get the impression that it's due to some inbred fault of Arabs not to accept responsibilty for their condition nor to take appropriate steps.The real reason for what went wrong probably has more to do with location, population sparsity, and unenlightened autocracy. Mostly, the same conditions that exist today."
4,Good Sociology; So-So History,"Mr. Lewis does some things well in this book: He writes well. He makes interesting points on the comparative sociological development of the Muslim world vis-a-vis Western and Oriental civilizations. His comments on the Muslim-versus-Western views of time, space and borders are great. His last chapter is worth reading several times. Very enjoyable book.Nonetheless, this is no history book. You won't learn many hard facts about or a chronology of Middle Eastern or Muslim history. You can understand and enjoy the book without your own base of historical knowledge, but you'll have to read something else to get that base."
5,everyone should get aquinted with this book.,this is well written and really is helpful in understanding the roots of the problem caused by 911. the author obiously knowws what he is talking about and has the credentials and credibility to go along with it. he is the most knowledgable in the subject in current times. it really is sad that most americans can tell you who won a reality show but they cantell you of the roots of a war that they are fighting and losing thier children to!
1,This book does not live up to the promise of its title,"This is an extremely disappointing read in every respect. It lacks insight, relevance, and profundity. You won't need the book's Afterword to tell you this is simply a sloppy, admixtured rehash of three twenty-year-old speeches attached to a post-September 11 Preface; you will have figured it out on your own after reading, for the third time in the same volume, about the output of a certain Turkish printing press, the importance of hats in Islamic society, or the place of European miniatures in Islamic art. If I learned anything from this book, it was quickly forgotten (probably buried under all the resentment at having been duped by the title). For true relevance and actual insight, try ""The Clash of Civilizations and the Remaking of World Order"" by Samuel P. Huntington."
1,This Book Went Wrong,"Bernard Lewis used to be a lecturer at Soas University of London when I was studying there. He always seemed to me to be less intersted in the subject he was teaching than pushing some overt agenda. This book is a testimony that it is nothing more than a money making venture on the back of the horrific events which occured to the shock of the world on september 11. Don't read this book, Lewis repeats stuff from older works and makes no clear conclusion. He should understand in a university essay that would be a fail!!"
3,"controversial, controversial, controversial ...","Im still reading the book (plan to finish it tonight), but I ventured to read other people's opinions.I agree that this book is an easy read, and has a lot of pretty entertaining facts, but I expected it to be more profound and less biased. Indeed, the title is extremely misleading - I suppose the one for the German edition properly reflected the big idea behind the book, but was not as catchy.May be good point is the controversial character of the book, but it may mislead an unprepared reader."
2,"An ""Instant Best Seller"" effort, not his top level work","I've enjoyed his previous books and respected his scholarship; however, this time around I think he's cobbled something together to hit a hot market. This is his post-WTC New Yorker article pumped up. The ""What Went Wrong"" in the title could be applied to his doing only part of the job on this subject.He seems to carefully avoid telling his American readers anything that might lead them to examine themselves, their country's policies, etc. In other words, he skilfully points his finger at Them most of the time, and thus avoids the possibility of being the target of any brickbats in an overheated time. He travels very, very safely over any ground that might upset Americans. Given his scholarly expertise this is a good book, but a ""soft"" one.A good scholar doing lightweight and very safe work."
3,Good History,"Bernard Lewis provides a good historical commentary on the current conflicts in the Middle East. In a world where many academics are allergic to democracy, Lewis' call for a democratic Middle East is refreshing. The book focuses, as the subtitle indicates, on the clash of Islam and modernity. Yet, on this central issue, the analysis is in my view superficial. Any analysis of Islam's reaction to modernity must ipso facto be theological. We are dealing with a theological phenomenon. A good successor to this book would consider how Christianity was able to assimilate its Jewish heritage, while Islam continues to view both Judaism and Christianity as corruptions. That theological comparison will reveal more about Islam's clash with modernity, than will an exclusively secular analysis."
3,50 percent perfect,"This is a very concise and extremely well written history of the ""Islamic world"".Some rewiever criticise the concentration on the Ottoman empire - but was this not the ""Islamic world"" for many centuries.My ""only"" criticism: Except for the last few pages, the book does not answer the question it put on the title!!As an expert on Middle East Affairs ( or something like this), one would expect clearer statements answering the question in the title. Had this question ""What Went Wrong"" been answered as well as the history was written, I would habe given the book six stars."
4,interesting generalizations from ottoman history,"Bernard Lewis' lectures make very interesting,if occasionally abrupt, reading. He is at his most detailedwhen concerned with the Ottoman empire after1400 CE. His general remarks on howthe past has affected muslim countries inthe 20th century are thought-provoking,he mentions few specifics.The book is a thoughtful, broad survey of the riseand fall of socioeconomic Islam, with nuggetsfrom the Ottoman empire in decline. Some ofhis remarks echo Amin Maalouf's very interestingafterword to _The Crusades from the Arab Point of View_,which is a nice complement to this book,as Maalouf is rich on detail for places and timeswhich Lewis passes over quickly."
2,Very disappointing,"Can made some great records, but you wouldn't know it based on the evidence here. This set features an unenlightening documentary (using mostly footage shot after 1974), and a very poor concert. For completists only."
4,"good weight, good cutting action","I would give these loppers 5 stars if they had telescoping handles. Also the little ""toro"" label on the side fell off (it's supposed to be permanent) which makes me wonder about other bits falling off or jamming up."
2,Did not hold up.,"These looked and felt as if they would work well and hold up for a few seasons; but not so. After medium work load, one of the blade tips broke off. This was after only a month of use (on the weekends). It was a 2-inch branch we were cutting, so it was at their rated limit. Still, the metal blade should not have snapped off as I don't feel we were misusing the tool in any way (such as twisting it during the cutting process). Perhaps they are better suited for lighter work."
1,Broken on 3rd use.,These were awesome while they lasted but blade broke on 3rd use. I can't recomend them anymore. This is an updated review.
3,"Better looking than sounding, blew within a year","I had these for about a year. They look pretty awesome with the yellow kevlar cone and everything but sound was good, not WOW. They blew within a year of use WITHOUT the use of an amplifier, they blew just with the CD deck. I had to throw them out."
1,Would not recommend,"EMDR is a well researched evidence based psychotherapy that can produce amazing results. As a clinical social worker who has treated trauma survivors with EMDR for several years I was excited when another clinician referred me to this CD. Before recommending to my clients I wanted to test it on myself and I'm glad I did. I tried four separate times, with varying circumstances, and the CD consistently made me more agitated, annoyed, unnerved, anxious, unable to sleep than before I used it. I will not be using this with my clients. Instead, I highly recommend bilateral stimulation CDs by David Grand, Mark Grant, or the companion CD of the same name to the book Tapping In by Laurel Parnell."
1,awful-do not buy,"oh my what a waste of money this was. Do NOT buy this tape for meditation, or EMDR. AWFUL"
5,"Excellent tool for stress, anxiety","I purchased this CD from Robert's website last year and have found it instrumental in lowering anxiety and stress. The sound is rich and pleasing. I find it most helpful to listen while in a meditative posture, following the sound from ear to ear.This CD has helped me process a lot of anxious feelings, thoughts and fears and I highly recommend it. It only takes a few minutes of listening for me to begin to feel the benefits of this sound: A sense of peace, relaxation, and well-being."
5,A New Horizon in Psychotherapy,"I am Dr. Mohamed Taha, MS.c. Psych.I had the opportuinity to do a research study on Yourell's ideas. I found that his work is so creative, applicable and effective. I think that his contributions to the field of EMDR are of great value. This is really is new forward step, a new horizon to be opened and a new land to be discovered in psychotherapy, both in theory and practice.I am happy that Yourell has puplished his important experiences..This will be of much benefit both to specialists and the general population."
5,Right Size?,"It would be nice if these size charts would be marked youth or adult. When I click on S, am I getting an adult small or a youth small?"
5,Co Ro is so hot !,"I love this album. You'll get your money's worth by getting it. All his songs are GREAT! My favorite of all time is ""Missing You"" ah.... :)"
5,Smitty knows all.,Dick gives a different view of coaching softball. Always enjoy some of Dick's wisdom.
1,horrible plastic pants,"Although snaps are definitely a must for ease of placing on my husband, these plastic pants have already torn in less than 1 month. Have been alternating with 2 other brands of non-snap plastic pants and have been hand-washing and air drying all 3. The plastic where it comes into contact with urine and desitin has changed from soft plastic to a very hard plastic and has torn in those areas. The other 2 plastic pants although pull-ups have remained soft same as when purchased. Very disappointed- this snap-on plastic pant does not hold up. Also urine still leaks out of the legholes."
4,Durable and Effective.,These are just right for our needs. They are soft and yet durable. They wash well in the machine and air dry quickly. Very effective.
2,OVERBLOWN,THIS POSTER WAS BLURRY AS IT WAS BLOWN UP TO MUCH. I BOUGHT IT TO HANG IN MY OFFICE(DOG TRAINER) BUT DID NOT PUT IT UP.
3,"Good songs, Bad EDITED CD","This cd is a decent collection of Queen Latifah's past hits. My main problem : The censoring. While I can understand the censoring on ""R.O.U.G.H"" And ""Black Hand Side, The censoring onU.N.I.T.Y.is just plain wrong. Now, I can understand why some people would find the words ""B!+(#"" and ""#o"" wrong, the purpose behind the use of the words on the song have a stong message behind it : Women shouldn't tolerate name calling. CensoringU.N.I.T.Y.defeats the whole purpose of the song. The version on this cd is a remix and the new instrumental track to the song is pretty much the only plus to it. While this is a decent collection, it needs improvement"
2,too hard to follow,I wish I would have read the reviews before purchasing this workout. I bought the other two and LOVED them so much I ran out to get this one. The instructions in this video are in voice over and don't necessarily match all that well. There is not enough warning between moves. Very confusing and hard to keep up. I kept rewinding and retrying over and over. I even tried to do the workout on mute and just watch for myself but the camera angles are so strange and change so much. Disappointing because instructed correctly this could be a really great workout. Way too hard to follow.
3,Difficult to master the moves,"The step moves constantly change and are not properly cued. Although we are often told to ""not worry you will get it"", I felt clumsly and prefer to be taught the moves by breaking them down, then gradually adding more.If you do the DVD a few times its OK, but takes time to get to that point."
1,Couldn't get through first time use...,"I got about five minutes into this the first time I used it. The workout is a good one, but the trainer doesn't explain what the moves are much or how to do them very well, and a lot of them are squat-based or involve you pointing your head somewhere other than the TV. I kept having to swivel my head back and forth from the TV to me and kept missing changes or not performing some of the exercises right because I couldn't see everything that was going on.I think you'd probably have to watch this entire tape before you tried doing ANYTHING, and that involves more sitting, which is what I'm trying to get away from doing."
2,Not what I was looking for,I like hard cardio workouts and this won't even make me sweat.It was a waste of money.
2,Not a huge fan of this video,"I am not a huge fan of this workout. I used Kim's booty workout that was On Demand on Fit TV and loved it! I thought this was the same workout, but it is NOT. The video is very hard to follow and hardly an effective workout for someone that works out at least 5 times a week."
5,just received,"Oooh, i waited so long and now it's finally here :). The estimated delivery date was July 7, 2009, but i recieved it in July 15 (i'm from Latvia). That's about shipping and delivery.Now i just need a step equipment and i can't wait to start the workouts. The combinations doesn't seem so difficult (i'm a dancer so that's not nothing new to me) but i believe they will do good for my figure. Sometimes Kim's voice is little anoing but you can get use to it. What matters is that i like Kim's body and i love that this is very modern and fun workout.As i said can't wait to have my equipment and start the workout!"
3,i was dissappointed,i did not like dis dvd yu really have 2 memorize the moves 2 get it nd workout 4 diis dvd i recommend the other 2 dvds but dis one is juss so complicated nd all ove da place i ws not too sore wit dis 1 but the other 2 are amazinggg
2,It's OK,I didn't think there were too many instructions on how to do the moves. I didn't like that you have to use a step. I don't want to have to buy something else along with the DVD. Thank goodness I just rented it!
3,kimmys DVD should come w a stepper,"I really like the dvd but I was disappointed knowing that I would need to buy a stepper in order to begin my workout. Other than that, kim looks beautiful and very motivating."
3,Not What I Expected,"I purchased this product because I am physically shaped like Ms. Kardashian and I believed that this workout dvd would help me to keep my shape. Needless to say, I watched the dvd before I actually attempted and was disappointed. Then I actually worked out with the dvd and realized that the cueing was terrible. I am not a beginner stepper nor am I considered an advanced stepper but the cueing and moves did not allow me to have a good workout."
4,This DVD is soooooo much fun,I got the abs sculpt DVD and I loved it - decided to get this one too. This is not as intense as the other one but its way more fun because you are dancing and doing moves that focus on your butt which is my biggest problem area. I love using minimal equipment but all you need is literally a step.
1,HORRIBLE,"This has got to be BY FAR the WORST exercise video EVER! I got this after purchasing a step. I had a couple of DVDs already but wanted to switch up my routines. The ONLY reason I got this was because on the back it mentioned Patrick Goudeau as an instructor of some sort. I LOVE his step routines so thought I would like this one too. WRONG! First of all, she's narrating most of the video. You hear her talking but when they show her, her lips aren't moving. SECOND.. she goes into moves with no warning or instruction on how to do the moves until she's well into them. This routine was just a MESS! I didn't get 5 mins into before I got frustrated and yanked the DVD out of my player. DO NOT waste your money. Get Kathy Smith, Denise Austin or Patrick Goudeau's REAL step workouts, REAL fitness instructors."
1,Wouldn't recomend.,"Anyone who has taken a step class would be very annoyed with this video. The steps are pretty basic but she does a horrible job calling them out. It's a voice over and she call them as they are doing it on the video, leaving no time to prepare yourself for what's next. Nothing is done in eight counts so in order to follow and keep up you must memorize it. The only way you will break a sweat from this video is if your heat is cranked. Bottom line, don't waste your time or money."
1,THEY DON'T SEND YOU THE BRAND NAME PRODUCT,This company sends you non-brand name third party products only. The listing is misleading.
3,ok,"Even as small as this is, my gerbils are not able to move it. It didn't take much to crack it out, but that is most likely from my kids being ruff. But the price was pretty good."
1,Not worth my money!,First off I ordred two of these for my pet mice. The one ball wasn't even put together right and didn't line up in the middle! Second off the lids didn't close on either of them and my mice escaped within the first minute of rolling around. DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS.
1,I ruined it on day one,"All I have to say about this item is that if a plastic container isn't microwave safe, it should be clearly printed on its surface."
3,Inconsistent closure,"I have two of these exercise balls for my mice to use. The first one's closure seems to work fine and has not ever opened on its own. I purchased a second one and was very surprised when the closure came off while my mouse was inside. This was despite the fact that the closure seemed secure. Please, be careful when you are using it and tape it up to be certain. On the plus side, my mice really seem to like them and have a fun time going around the house."
1,Fell apart after one use,"Well, I guess you get what you pay for, after one use, the ball fell apart... It was a good thing my mouse wasn't in the ball when it fell apart, because my cats would have eaten him..."
4,Good Dwarf Hampster Ball,"I bought this ball for my dwarf hampster. As for the lower reviews saying the door doesnt stay shut, mine stays suut just fine, no need to tape. i feel confident in it, if i didnt i would deff tape it, because these hampsters are very skidish and fast.it does seem to be a little bit to small for a dwarf hampster tho, i think 6 inces would be perfect. and 7 i think might be a bit to big. but it doesnt seem like much of a deal for him. it also comes with some fre chew toy things, which i havent seen my hampster use them at all but hey. they were free.I give this ball a 4 star just because i seems a tad t small for the dwarf hampster. they need to make a 6 inch one."
4,"Good product, with extra precautions","I have a Campbell's Dwarf. She's a little big for this, but she still gets going in it. I got the next size bigger, but she couldn't move it as well. I returned that one and I'll be sticking with the smaller one so she can really get going. As with most items that give small rodents freedom, I took extra measures and taped the door shut. I really don't want to have to chase a 3 inch hamster around the house. All-in-all, a good product for exercising my dwarf hamster."
3,ok,this ball is ok lid is not secure you must tape down.. this ball is only good for an average sized hamster i have a drawf and my little one does not have the strenghth to move the ball..
3,Maybe I just got unlucky...,"I ordered 2 of the Super Pet Dwarf Hamster balls (one ""Moon Glow"" and one ""Rainbow"").The ""Moon Glow's"" lid doesn't fit securely. It's not so small that it falls through but it wont secure shut. After running into a few walls the lid comes undone. I ended up just taping the lid to hold it through the collision. The ""Rainbow"" ball works just fine and doesn't come undone.On a good note it's a good size for my little dwarf hamsters and they seem happy running around."
3,Hamster ball,the ball works well but my only complaint is that it does not lock on tight enough so that the cap comes off sometimes. This means my hamsters get out and run around as they please. I usually just stick some tape on the cap to make it stick. Other than that it is the perfect size for my dwarf hamsters.
5,He loved it!,Our hamster loved this. Make sure that you click the top on tightly or the hamster can escape. Turst me.
4,British Military Swords: From 1800 to the Present day,"While not a definitive work this is an essential reference book for those collecting British swords of the period. Well illustrated with industry insights available from a member of the Wilkinson family. Well worth the price, I am very pleased with the book."
2,NO INTERPRETA CON TRIO LOS PANCHOS,"NO INTERPRETA CON EL TRIO LOS PANCHOSEL CD ES INTERPRETADO POR DON RAUL SHAW MORENO COMO SOLISTA EN EL AÑO APROX.1999,ACOMPAÑADO CON ORQUESTA Y EN ALGUNOS SEGMENTOS CON GUITARRAS.EN NINGUNO DE LAS TEMAS PARTICIPA EL TRIO LOS PANCHOS.LAMENTABLEMENTE LOS AÑOS NO PASAN EN VANO ,PUES ES BIEN EVIDENTE QUE DON RAUL SE AHOGA O SE QUEDA SIN AIRE AL TRATAR DE VOCALIZAR O SUBIR EN LAS NOTAS ALTAS.Recorded in the early 1950's. Personnel includes: Raul Shaw Moreno, Trio Los Panchos.--------WRONG STATEMENT!!!!!!GRACIAS,DAVID SEGARRA PLAZA"
1,Decepcionante compilación.,"Creía que esta era una compilación de las grabaciones de Los Panchos durante el año 1951, teniendo como primera voz al boliviano Raúl Shaw Moreno. Pero no, es un trabajo realizado posteriormente por Shaw Moreno en plena vejez, cuando ya su voz no le funcionaba. Falta de práctica, alguna afección, no lo se. Mejor busque una compilación con sus éxitos de los años 50 de EMI, para la cual grabó cuando aún se llamaba Odeón. Mejor es recordar a Shaw Moreno, cuando aún estaba en plenitud de sus facultades y no como quedó, al igual que Lucho Gatica."
4,"Good book, lacking detail","Sure, it lacks a bit of detail that I would like about the birds. Sure some of the pictures do not seem to be that clear but shesh, this is field guide. This is small enough to carry with you and the color coding is awesome! If you are new to birding, like me, then get the book.You can always buy books that have every little detail about the bird. Use those books to study the bird before you go out. This is for when you are out and go ""What bird was that?"". It was almost all brown... so go to the brown section.I now have two of his books. Will get more as I go to that state.-Jeffwww.avvedutiphotography.com"
1,Price is right - shipping is wrong,"I just ordered this item and neglected to double check the shipping. It seemed like a pretty good price at $5.95, but the shipping and handling turned out to be $6.68. I will go to a bricks and mortar store before I pay that.Ordered canceled."
5,Outlook 2000 - great book for a great program,This is an excellent reference guide to learn the basics of OL2K - the chapters are well organized and there is excellent information for both first time users and for those who are into automation. Highly recommended. I've had this book for over 4 months and it still gets used.
4,Takes your knowledge of Outlook to a new level!,Very detailed and in depth. I wish the author had a chapter that delt with possible common errors one might run into in a production environment.Explains many hidden areas of productive extras that can be found deep within Outlook 2000.
2,Hunting Sign,When you look at the Photo you see Black Lettering on white Back GroundWhat did they send?Red printing on white back ground.Whoul not have purchased if I knew that.
3,Maps don't work on Kindle; text does.,Maps were useless on a kindle. Text would be helpful on the trail. My idea was to use the kindel to save weight probablely would not work. Recommend buying the paperback reprint when it comes out in Febr. 2013.
4,Excellent but dated,There is a new edition out but it is already out of print! This is still the best backup if you can't get the latest edition. It is still the best guide for the PCT in Oregon and Washington as we are less concerned about those states than conditions in California.
4,Very descriptive,"Overall this book is very detailed and easy to use. It provides good information on the trail, how to leave the trail in order to resupply and possible issues such as water or wild animals. The only thing I don't like about it is that the maps in the book are completely lacking any kind of coordinate grid which makes it difficult to locate on the map points the author is writing about."
2,Not much for planning a trip,"I recently hiked the last section described in the book (Rainy Pass to Canada). The book is fairly worthless if you are looking for a guide that is going to allow you to plan your spots to camp and to get water. The authors arbitrarily choose to mention some campsites and ignore others. The same goes for places to get water. Often times the campsites they choose to mention do not have nearby water, when a couple of miles further on there are excellent campsites near streams that are not mentioned at all! However, if you are interested in geological information on the area you are passing through, the book has plenty of that."
3,Wild Target,"The movie was OK. Seemed like a B movie, average actors, plot kind of gets lost, and has that lame feel. But that British comedy is there and a happy ending. Made it through it."
2,Not Bill Nighy's best,"The film relies on a lot of whacky premises for a lot of its humor. (Nighy's character is the last in a family line of paid assassins with no heir to continue the family business. Blunt's character strolls through life stealing and conning everything she needs without ever getting caught. )The comedy built on these foundations just didn't work for me. Perhaps if I were in a different mood, it all would have seemed screwball and charming. I do know people whose taste is generally like mine who liked the film. That's why I rented it. But I couldn't make it to the end, which is pretty rare for me."
5,Hilarious!,"Emily Blunt and Billy Nighy are absolutely wonderful in this somewhat dark romantic comedy. It is really quite funny and excellently executed by all actors. While Rupert Grint's character doesn't differ too much from that of Ron Weasley from the Harry Potter series, he is a good fit in this trio, and really holds his own amongst veteran actors."
3,"Okay movie, good for a couple laughs",Decent movie with decent actors with a decent plot. It's worth a watch but not worth a lot of money.
4,Entertaining Movie - Fun Even For Such An Odd Storyline,"It's always a pleasure to watch Bill Nighy, he could read a telephone directory and make it funny and Emily Blunt is a wonderful kleptomaniac."
3,Playing murder for laughs,"Victor Maynard (Bill Nighy) is an erudite, posh gentleman who also happens to be a professional hit man. Hired to terminate Rosie (Emily Blunt), a pretty young thief, he instead falls for her. On the run from the men who hired him, they are accompanied by a confused stoner (Rupert Grint) as they hide out till the coast is clear.I always enjoy the wonderful Bill Nighy and he has many witty scenes early on; unfortunately, none of them are shared with Blunt or Grint. Blunt's character is thoroughly unlikable and she has no romantic chemistry with Victor; Grint's drifter serves no purpose in the story, he's awkward, and mumbles his dialogue. The film starts out promising enough as we watch Victor alone, but once the three come together it's absurd and silly.This is an okay rental, just don't expect big laughs or a plausible script."
4,HOW MUCH DO YOU WEIGH?,"This is a humorous British story about an assassin and his elusive target. Bill Nighy plays the 55 year old Victor who lives at home with his mother. Being an assassin is a third generation occupation. Victor is ""old school"" in his job and his mother worries that he may become a homosexual. His hobbies include learning French, chess, and encapsulating his furniture in plastic.Rose is a light fingered free spirit. She had a copy made of a Rembrandt, made a switch and double crossed a buyer. Victor is supposed to kill her, but after a few failed attempts because of her Inspector Clouseau ability to avoid a bullet, he has become an admirer of the girl and in a twist of fate becomes her protector with Ron Weasly as his apprentice.While the story was humorous, it lacked a certain uniqueness. Emily Blunt was good, but I liked Rachel Weisz as a free spirit in the ""Brothers Bloom"" more."
2,"Sadly, a pretty terrible movie","I really, really wanted to like this movie. Based on previous reviews, it seemed like it would be a winner. Um, no. It was boring, not funny and poorly acted."
5,I do not usually use this work but PERFECT!,"Perfect! It never takes itself seriously, very laid back, very funny, very self-aware - EXTREMELY ENJOYABLE! Not to be missed!!!"
4,Fun/Sassy British comedy,"Cute, fun/sassy and TOTALLY ENJOYABLE British comedy. Bill Nighy, Emily Blunt and Rupert Grint gave wonderful performances. If the trailer appeals to you - then watch this movie - you won't be disappointed. :-)"
2,A hitman with arthritis?,"Preface. I clicked on Amazon instant video and it says ""Special offer rent this for 99 cents."" Nope $3.99.The story: It was campy and it was slow paced. Also, The fact the main character (the actual actor) had arthritis and could barely hold a pistol let alone actually aim it long enough to kill anyone was totally unbelievable. It pulled me out of the film. They actually had a hand double in the foot massage scene and one other scene when he was assembling a firearm. If this was any other character (non hitman) I would have let it go as typical movie bull, but a HIT man?! Bah! what ever. I want my $2.99 back!"
4,Enjoyable and watchable,"I enjoyed this light, fun movie. It moved along nicely and was a lot of fun, finally getting to see Rupert Gint in something other than Harry Potter was fun. I look forward to him being in more movies. This is one I'll watch periodically just for the fun of it"
3,Good performances in search of a plot,"This is very light weight movie. I enjoyed watching it, but soon forgot about it. A decent rental with a cast of familiar British faces."
4,A funny yet charming film,"I was pleasantly surprised at how much I liked this movie. I do appreciate a bit of British humor once in a while-like how people will comment on the obvious: ""You just shot my ear off."" and the amusing yet practical response: ""Sorry-you frightened me! If you put it on ice, hospital can sew it back on..."" yet things never get too gross or fall into the realm of toilet humor. There's hardly even any cursing.We get a nice tour of London and the countryside, lots of cobbled streets and grand old stone buildings and even an old, old wooden house with natural sunlight and very creaky floors.The main characters are all likable, (even the gentleman assassin) and the wonderful 'family' feeling that grows between them is cute to watch. Perhaps one of the nicest moments is how the movie deals with the concept of homosexuality-in a rather mature, sensitive manner that won my instant respect for both of the characters involved. Nicely done."
4,Wild Target Definately Hits The Mark,"I stumbled across this movie and I'm so glad that I did. I laughed the whole way through.*May Contain Spoilers* An all star cast includes Bill Nighy as Victor Maynard a notorious hitman flirting w/ retirment who can't kill his latest target. Emily Blunt as Rose a klepto who has coned Rupert Everett's character Ferguson out of great deal of cash making her Maynard's latest target. Tony(Rupert Grint)is a drifteresq guy w/ great aim when the occasion calls for it. Martin Freeman as Hector Dixon another hitman who is called in to take out both Maynard and Rose. And Eileen Atkins as Victor's mum, who will take matters into her own hands. A british comedy w/ action that everyone will enjoy. Give this one a look see you won't be disappointed."
2,Not Happy!,"User unfriendly and very difficult to use. Not intuitive and found that it takes pictures on a hit and miss basis. When shutter is depressed, flash goes off, and sometimes it takes the picture and sometimes it doesn't. We are long time Nikon product users and are VERY disappointed in this product. This is a first for us because we have been pleased with the many other Nikon products we own. Pictures are of lesser quality than other digital cameras we own with less megapixels."
5,Simply the best,"Wow what a neat compact digital camera ! Easy to use for any beginner , pictures that I took came out fantastic !!!!"
1,coolpix headache,"Is Nikon still the best? They may be, or maybe not,it doesn't make any difference. The aggaravation they give their customers make that a mute point.. After the camera arrives, you can use it about a half hour and that's it. Just try finding the parts you need to actually use this camera. I was willing spend hours on the 200 page manual but not hours on the internet trying to find the missing essential parts ( no one seems to sell both the charger and the battery and everyone wants to sell subs.) And Nikon is no help at all. They're willing to sell incomplete cameras through lots of internet suppliers but will only offer guidance to old style retail stores for parts, none of which are anywhere nearby. .tom"
1,885 Has Significant Software Problems,"We found that the 885 software was, in the end, impossible to load onto our Windows 98 computer. We had multiple ""blue screens of death"" and printer conflicts. For a fuller description of some of the issues, please see the forums postings in www.dpreview.com concerning similar issues with the 995. And, the Nikon web site is not particularly helpful. The camera itself seemed to work ok . . ."
4,awesome camera,super small. great features. excellent quality pictures. pretty darned good color in the images too...
4,I love this camera,"I chose a digital camera because I'm tired of scanning. I've used it at all resolutions and as long as I use the image as I intend it's great! For example: don't expect good prints from VGA but they're great for e-mailing.My only complaint is the red problem.. somehow very few of my photos have included red so I guess I can't complain much about it.If you have a USB port and you already have Photoshop there is no reason to load the included software (as a matter of fact I haven't). The images download quickly and easily to your computer it sees the camera just like it another drive. I've ordered prints off of the internet and they come back GREAT! This way I'm not paying for those two pics at the end of every roll that you have to ""use up"" or the ones where the cat ran off as you snap the photo. I have half a film in my film based camera that I'll never finish!"
4,Great value for Money,This is my first Digital Camera and I am glad I got this after doing a lot of Digtial Camera Research. The clarity and color balance of the pictures are really good.The only annoying fact was that I have to reset the date everytime I change the battery.
1,dial mode conked out after a year of usage,"when i decided to get a digital camera, i went to the camera expert and that for me was NIKON. it was april 2003 when i purchased my first digital camera NIKON COOLPIX 885. after a year of using it, the dial mode just conked out and won't function anymore. i am very disappointed, i had to ship my camera to the only service center in my country. I shouldered the shipment plus the replacement spare part which is going to cost me $100 plus. it has been two months with follow ups in between and i was told by the service center the spare part has not arrived from Japan yet.of course, after only a year of using this camera, i feel i did not get my money's worth.i expected a lot from nikon but they failed me. for my next digital camera purchase, i will get PENTAX, CANON or SONY instead"
4,nikon 885 impression,"this camera takes wonderful, striking photos, good color, excellent macro mode, compact design. i haven't spent enough time yet studying the modes and the quality of auto makes me put it off. it is a battery and memory hog. the 16 mg card that comes with it is not even close to being enough, i would recommed a 64 at least, 128 would be preferred, or both. a battery charger and one at least rechargeable battery is a must, two batteries would be preferable for more than casual shooting and to keep up with more memory.as my fourth digital camera, it is impressive and will last me i hope until there is a digital slr with 4+ megapixels for around $1000. shop around for the best price of course."
4,CoolPix885 - Pretty cool!,"I just got the CoolPix 885. I bought it unseen off of Amazon. I was suprised that is is so small. The quality is supurb, as you would expect from Nikon. The camera is not as intuitive as I would like, but I am not unhappy with the camera. I am getting used to the new world of digital pictures and I have some more learning to do.I would recommend that anyone getting a digital camera (especially if it has movie mode) upgrade to at least a 128MB memory card. I just ordered a 256MB memory card. The 32MB that comes with the camera fills up fast if you take lots of photos."
2,Prison Drama Turned Comedy,"Just like the first two ""Penitentiary"" movies, Leon Isaac Kennedy ends up falsely accused and back in prison again. The plot keeps building up fear of ""The Midnight Thud"". When Kennedy asks another con about ""The Thud"" he replies...""You'll be sleeping in your rack about midnight when the cell door opens. You hear a thud and then your manhood is gone."" But when you see ""The Thud"", this movie turns into a comedy. He's a black midget they keep in a basement cell, feeding him a constant diet of cocaine and porn films. When he comes to get Kennedy it looks like a monkey trying to rip Kennedy's ears off. It's hilarious. Don't miss it."
3,"A bit dimmed down and small, but not TOO bad....","This book actually caught me by surprise. The book is very small, about as thick as a pancake. After reading the novel adeptation of the first film, I excepted it to be about just as long or longer. It isn't.If you are a Mortal Kombat fan, I say check it out, but be aware, there's is nothing too special about this book. It's basically a dimmed down version of the original movie itself.Also....The book has pictures of the live action movie inside...too bad some of the characters names are wrong on the picture descriptions....it's a bit comical but ehhh.... they should have did some research...."
4,Excellent French Textbook,"This textbook takes an effective approach to learning French by way of immersion. Aside from the introductory explanation of methodology, there is nary a word of English in the book. This encourages students to begin thinking in French, rather than learning to translate to French. Of course, it is not a practical text for someone learning French on his or her own, as it is intended for the classroom setting. It is also used most effectively in conjunction with the companion workbook and audio tapes. My only criticism is that the paperback version of the book looks like it was printed off an old photostat machine -- the pictures are of particularly poor quality."
5,Winter Warmer,"And here again, Ms. Beaudoin presents us with another book full of erotic stories that are hot enough to warm you up on a cold and lonely winter night!Treat yourself to this and let your imagination soar!"
2,Not worth the price.,"The ""tutorial"" as presented by this book is somewhat difficult to follow. Despite the ""Your Turn"" prompts, the narrative seems to suggest that the reader should be doing something before getting to the exercise itself. The graphics that are displayed often do not follow the instructions for the exercise, so there is little reinforcement. Furthermore, the ""Your Turn"" instructions are poorly organized - often mixing hints with actual action commands. Given some time, one can eventually figure out what is supposed to happen on the screen, but why should the reader have to struggle? If you are going to spend nearly $60 on a book, look somewhere else. This has been a very disappointing purchase."
3,fuel connection,connection for the fuel to engine line is not solid built and I hope it won't leak out of it.
3,Good tank but a vent at 90deg would make it better,"Looking through the Moeller range there is not a single tank with a vent barb that doesn't stick straight out the top of the tank, which seems a bit daft when in this case the inlet and outlet both come out at right angles. With the tank as it is you need at least 6"" clearance above the tank for the vent pipe to not kink if it is being run under the deck using a separate 90 deg elbow with hose clamps. The positive side is that the vent barb is removable so in my case I had found a right-angle barb outlet that screwed in after calling Moeller and being told that you couldn't change it?? The other thing I wasn't so happy with is the fuel inlet is now one piece plastic, not aluminum as it shows on the photo and the photo's on the Moeller website. This (to me) can't be as strong and I was careful not to over-tighten the clamps."
3,Moeller below deck gas tank,"Moeller Marine Below Deck Permanent Fuel Tank (35-Gallon, 69.5"" x 16"" x 8"") wasn't totally what I needed but was able to install and to get functioning. Now only time will tell if product will stand up to ocean fishing."
5,One of the very best,"This is just a fantastic album. Joe Pass and NHOP are Oscars partners in this 1973 club recording. Oscar was probably at his virtuoso peak at this time, and this is probably the most technically proficient trio he ever had.The recording quality isn't fantastic, and the album is only about 40 mins long, but this an essential purchase if you're an Oscar fan or if you're somebody who wants to see what all the fuss was about.There are only five tracks, of which the first three tracks are basically blues. Blues Etude starts the album off at a stratospheric tempo. The solo Piano break near the end of this track is quite astonishing. The next two tracks are not quite as immediately breath-taking but still show the lie that ""Oscar sounded like he had to learn to play the Blues"". Thats a Miles quote and wonderful as Miles was, he was wrong about Oscar.Listen to this album and you'll see why."
4,check out blues etude!,"The first track, ""Blues Etude"" is just amazing--I've never heard anything else quite like it. Oscar is roaring (literally), playing with tremendous power, speed, and passion. The rest of the album is good, but anti-climactic. By the way, the I don't know which record the sample tracks listed above (as of this date) are actually on, but they are not the tracks found on ""The Trio."""
2,Crapola,Get Joe Pass at Montreux 1977 the one with Masquerade. This trio stuff dilutes the great Joe Pass with mediocre musicians. This CD here is pure corn. Everyone knows Joe only recorded this muzak for the money. Trolls and bots are welcome to comment.
2,Cocktail Hour -- Sarah Vaughan,"I am a new fan of Sarah Vaughan's and was highly anticipating the arrival of this album. I was sadly disappointed. Although it does include many of her well known songs, the sound quality on this CD is uneven, and frankly terrible. I would strongly suggest you skip buying this CD and get Ultimate Sarah Vaughan instead."
4,Excellent compilation for the Sarah neophyte,"Possessing a voice that at times seemes almost ethereal, these cuts offer a glimpse of a singer who, in my estimation, could do no wrong. A great way for a new listener to listen to a wide cross section of Sarah Vaughn's career. Two caveats, some of these recordings are over 5 decades old and the sound quality reflects it. Get over it! Also, this exposure to Ms Vaughn's discography could lead to a ""Sassy"" habit!!"
1,Read This Before You Order ...,"Sarah Vaughan is one of the greatest vocalists of the past century ... but the quality of the sound on these CDs terrible! A few of the cuts are OK, but very few. Sad."
5,Awesome!!,This book listed all the concise information necessary to pass the new BSCI exam. The author did an excellent job presenting the information in an easy to read flow. The exam simulation questions really help you focus your studies in the areas the exam will require you to know. The cram sheet is an excellent tool to review before taking the exam. This book also contained excellent reference material for routing configuration.
5,excellent four player game,"Some friends brought this game over last night, and we had a blast. We played from 9 to 2 AM and laughed the entire time. The mini-games are great, and by the end of the night we weren't playing the board games anymore, just competing for high scores in the individual mini-games we liked the best. Torpedo Pond is the most fun. Definitely a great game for couples to play together."
3,wrong picture!,"I specifically ordered this book because I liked the picture of the cover. I received the book, and it is a different picture. I am not happy, as this was a gift for someone special."
5,Perfect condition,"I needed this book for my gothic literature class, and it came in the mail a few days after I ordered it in perfect condition. Thank you very much!!"
3,Great even after seeing the movie 10 times,"A lot of people say this is Stephen King's scariest book. I disagree. Maybe because I've seen the movie several times. Either way, the book is a modern classic. Everyone knows the story, or at least should have seen the movie. The book goes into a lot more detail about Jack's personal life which does help give the book an errie foreshadowing that the movie ignores. I really enjoyed this book even after seeing the movie because it is written so well with a lot of character development.Help me find a good book - [...]"
5,Every bit as gripping and thrilling on audio as on screen,"Stephen King's The Shining first appeared in 1977 and has enjoyed ongoing celebration as an outstanding horror story, receiving film benefits equally powerful: so it's interesting to note this classic appears on audio for the first time under the practiced voice of Campbell Scott, a film director who knows what makes good acting on stage and on recordings. The Shining is every bit as gripping and thrilling on audio as on screen: in audio every nuance of horror comes to life."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"I didn't find The Shining too interesting as a book.A broken-down recovering guy ends up trapped with the family in a hotel, that is not your average hotel.Clairvoyant cooks, ghosts, and other not so nice things, like a possessed alky come up to play as the place goes stir crazy."
1,Have I missed something?,"Perhaps the concept of a haunted hotel simply doesn't work for me, but I can't find a single thing I like about this book. And I don't mean because it scared me--if only it had that would've been a point in its favour. But no single part of this book--the hotel's history, the wasps, Jack Torrance going crackers, REDRUM, the lady in the bathtub, the 'scary' hedge animals--none of it did anything for me. And the thing is King's other books are so scary--""It"" is probably one of the most frightening novels ever conceived. I don't know why it's hailed as a classic--maybe it got ruined for me when that ""Friends"" episode told me how it ended."
1,The worst I've ever read,"Although I'm a great Stephen King fan, I simply hate this book and don't understand all the hoopla around it. The characters are absurd, the ""scary"" parts (like the animated stone animals) are histerically laughable and I couldn't wait for seeing when will this mess would do me the favor to be over. I've noticed that King is a writer that gives multilayered book, like a bad novel with a good ending (read Cujo) or a good novel with a bad ending (read Pet Semetary) but nothing of that happens in this book. The Shining is absurd, ridiculous and by far, the worst book he's ever written. If you want to see children in a scary book, that really scares you, go and read some John Saul."
1,Overrated author...,"I used to read King to be popular as every9one else was... this, Cujo, and the Stand ruined him. I am quite anti-King because of it. There are quite a few better authors (including my two favorites, Clive Barker and Brian Lumley) and this book can not measure up to any of their work. normally I haeva feeling of satisfaction when i finish a book. I was bored when i finished this one."
5,EXCELLENT READ!!!,This is the best book I have ever read. Intense is the onlyword that comes to mind when I think of the Shining. Intense andSCARY!!!!
5,A Great Read!,"This book is great! It's not that is increadably scary, but the way Stephen King writes about Jack going insane and how Danny thinks. Another good thing King brings out is how the hotel possesses Jack and how he tries to battle it. There are suspensefull moments where you wonder what will happen. If you saw the movie, but didn't read the book, I assure you that the book is much better."
4,Dang good,"King's first novels were undoubtably his best. Out of those, I must say that The Shining is truly a standout. What makes it most chilling is that it's told mostly from the perspective of a child who knows too much. In this book, King is able to give us a fast-paced story without excessive character development. I would call this more suspense than horror. Either way, it's a dang good read."
5,Don't read if you're not ready to be scared!!!,"I've read this book 4 times now, the first time was in high school and I slept with my light on for a week!! But it got me hooked on Stephen King, you won't be disappointed!!"
5,Family Getaway,"""The Shining"" by Stephen King is set in the spacious confines of the luxurious Overlook Hotel. The Taurence family experience a slow decent into madness instead of the quiet getaway they had planned. This hotel had secrets of murder, mob deals and tragedy that are weaved liberally into a page turning mesh of horror and suspense.Based on the Stanley Hotel in Colorado, King has given us a mind bending foray into the respectful boy Danny and his relationship with his father Jack. Is a history of binge drinking and violence towards little Danny and his wife Wendy the only dangers that loom in the bowels of Jack's mind?"
4,"January 11, 2005 - 8:32 pm","finished The Shining. very dark book. not depressing, but dark. the constant allusions to the snow, cold, and wind make the feeling of the book sinister and dim. character development made it boring in the beginning, but then again so are all of the beginnings of king's books. i call this book suspense more so than horror. it was pretty good. could've been a 400 page book if the words weren't so damn big."
5,Great book,By far one of the best Stephen king books. This is a great book to read if.you are new to the author
5,Great book!!!,I loved this book. It started out a little slow but got a lot better the further you read. Good ending as well.
4,"Terrifyingly plausible, yet creatively fantastic.","When I finished reading this book, my first thought was, ""Wow"". A gripping page-turner from cover to cover, this masterpiece by Stephen King keeps you on the edge of your seat. The thing that makes this book stand out among others is the spectacular imagery. I could almost hear the crashes of crumbling plaster as Jack Torrance slammed the Roque mallet into the walls. The stunning complexity of this Tomé is mind-boggling, diving deep into the mind of various characters. Mr. King also exhibts the frighteningly real powers alcahol can hold over people, and the anger that it can bring about. Who, other than King, could create such a chillingly dark novel? His novel ranks even with the likes of classics, such as ""The Exorcist"". For a true dose of ""horror"" you must read this wonderful book."
3,"Alright, but a bit disappointing after seeing the movie first","The characters are good, but the book waivers far to the left from what happens in the movie. It's almost like two completely different stories...it's alright, but not what I expected."
5,TERRIFYING!,"This book has to be Steven Kings best to date! I previously read ""IT"" and was blown away by his detail but after reading the Shining Im hooked! HE is hands down the best writer of the century! I cant say enough about this book. If you want to be scared out of your pants and lying awake at night fearing your own house (like me) you have got to pick up this gripping psychological thriller!"
5,The Shining,"The shining splices two thrilling aspects of entertainment, Horror, and intense thrill. The story its self, connects drama, with intense aggrivation, and pure hatred, and possession.The story takes place in a remote mountain wilderness in Colorado. In the overlook hotel, which has a well renound reputation for hauntings. and mass murder, suicides. The first part of the story takes place in a much larger rural suburban area, in the outskirts of boulder Colorado.The family in the story, travel to the overlook, to take the job as ""winter care-takers"". Jack, the main charachter has quite a past behind him. and a past drinking habit re-lights, while hes at the overlook. Wendy Jack's wife is a self concious caring wife. She's on the verdge of splitting up with jack. Their son danny plays a huge role in the whole plot of the story. He has psychic abilities, which will save them in the end."
5,A great novel to hide in your freezer...,"I'm not normally a fan of horror novels, but I must say I really enjoyed this. It gripped me from the start. It's the only novel that truly frightening novel I've ever read. Just like Joey from friends, you'll want to hide it in the freezer so the horror doesn't get you in your sleep! Buy it now!"
5,Stephen King's masterpiece,This was the first book i read by Stephen King.let me tell you something : this is for sure his masterpiece and one of the greatest book ever made in the horror genre!It's just his third book (after Carrie and Salem's lot) but it's already mature and soon became his masterpiece.Buy it and you won't be disappointed!
3,"kinda good, kinda ridiculous","I never saw the movie, partly because I'm not a fan of horror, but I do like great writing, so lately I've been checking out some of Stephen King's recommended best reads. King is a great writer, let me say that, but I feel this story didn't benefit with the supernatural stuff. It works well in ""Firestarter"" and ""Carrie"" (which I enjoyed much better) but in ""The Shining"" it felt more ridiculous to this reader. I felt it would've been spookier without ""the shine"", still I was scared to read this novel when it got dark (I live alone).The ability to pass the shine 2000 or something miles from Colorado to Florida didn't seem plausible as well as Haloran's crazy interest in the 5yr old boy. Some things never added up well (the hedge animals). All in all I would only recommend this novel to hardcore horror fans. So far, ""Misery"", ""Carrie"" and ""Firestarter"" are my recommended SK reads."
4,Great Thriller,"Haven't read a book since that was ""better"" though I haven't read many since.Sometimes I didn't understand how Jack was so possible to break down.I also kind of don't like how there is a steady, yet choppy and then jumpy movement into sheer ""magic"" the bolt that slides open.Jack becoming immune to death&pain...I; just did not get it?Make's me not want to read IT as I imagine the same kind of mechanisms are likely in play.Still, I loved it"
5,REDRUM,"This book is a very good book and I think anyone who wants to get scared out of thier wits should read it. I especially like Dick Hallorran because he is awesome. It's too bad the movie is rated R. I really want to see the ""Here's Johnny"" part. I will never throw away my copy of The Shining by Stephen King ever. The only part I didn't like was when.... it ended! If I ever go to the Overlook Hotel I am definetly bringing this book with me. However I will not go into room 217. If you want to know why read the Shining by Stephen King, just make sure to leave the lights on when you go to bed."
3,Much Better Than The Movie,"This is one of Stephen King's better books. It follows the movie (the Jack Nicholson one) only roughly. There is a lot more meaning put into the 'shining' power itself. There is also no hedge maze in the book, but there are hedge animals that behave pretty strangely. It does get a bit windy at times about the hotel's history and Jack's past. An excellent book!"
3,"Good book, but not near as good as the movie","I just finished reading The Shining, and although it was a good book, compared to the Stanley Kubrick movie, it just paled in comparison. The movie always had a creepy feel as Jack went closer and closer to violent insanity, but the book wasn't very scary. At the end of the book I was really looking forward to Jack's psychotic chase after Wendy and Danny, but it was short and in my opinion a let down. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed it, but the book didn't have the scary qualities I was expecting to see."
2,Don't Get Your Hopes Up,"I remember after first seeing the movie how people kept telling me, ""oh, you HAVE to read the book! All the holes in the movie are filled in with the book!"" Well, I just finished reading and...... is that it? Is there a Part II that I missed? I'm sorry, but this is a pretty basic story that goes on and on and on about the boring thoughts each of the characters have during every point in the story. A bunch of boring spooks haunting a hotel. Some posessed hedges. Yawn. Scary? Please."
1,A little disappointing,"This was the first SK book I ever read, so I was excited to see that it was available in audio. I loved this book. Not so the audio version. DO NOT listen to this book on a long trip. It will make you fall asleep. The story is still awesome - but I would have preferred it be read by someone with a little more interest in their voice."
2,Watch the movie instead,I read half of this book in 2008 and had to stop because I was so bored. I decided to finish it a couple months ago and wish I hadn't. The decision to finish The Shining led me to one of the gravest mistakes of my life; I read the book IT. I have heard so many people sing the praises of Stephen King that I figured the Shining was just a bad fluke and decided to read IT because of all the regards it has received. The Shining is not a fluke; Stephen King is just a boring author that doesn't understand the genre of horror. Maybe these books were good back in the 1980's when horror sucked. I won't go into the actual details of the book because they are way too ridiculous. Watch the movie instead; Stanley Kubrick actually had vision for this story.
5,My King favorite,"My son asks me what's the scariest book I've ever read and I reply ""The Shining."" Every summer or so I like to re-read it and it STILL scares me. What fun!"
5,Spell-bindingly macabre,"This book truly epitimizes the Stephen King we all know and love. He takes a simple ghost story and turns it into a captivating piece of work that, hopefully someday, will become required reading in the public schools that currently obstruct my flow of creativity. I strongly advise any person willing to frighten themselves silly to purchase this book and savor it for many years to come."
4,"Of all King novels, this is the ONE you need to read","King takes a standard, long used formula of ficton, isolation + mental instability + haunted mansion= a good gothic/horror story and knocks it out of the ball park. There is a certain feeling experienced when reading this book, the setting, characters and situations adding to the perfect storm of dread and the collapsing of stable reality into a waking nightmare. Lots of strange scenes with the feeling of coldness, isolation, and fear you desire from a good horror story. So much of the novel feels like a bad dream, and is one of the reasons I feel it resonates so well with readers."
5,Worth the reaf,I always loved the movie still the read is worth it for any King fan. Few suprizes here for movie lovers
5,Amazing book!!,"The Shining is a fantastically written book that is much better than the movie. Everything seems to be a symbol, and the use of color is very interesting. There are a lot of mysteries to figure out which makes reading it fun. I definately reccommend it to people who have seen the movie and enjoyed it, but the book I think you would like more."
4,A Psychological Thriller,"This is the best book I have read by Stephen King and it should be considered as a modern masterpiece. As I said in the title, it is not so much a ""horror story"" as it is a psychological drama. King takes his time to set the mood and introduce us to the world Jack lives in. At the same time, strange things start happening in the hotel. As these bizarre events begin to unfold, Jack's mental state deteriorates. It doesn't have a lot of chainsaws and screaming women, but King convincingly pulls you into this vortex of madness that is absolutely chilling."
5,Creepy!,"This book was so good (and yes I have read all 700 or so pages of this complex thriller) The author writes with a distinctive style and describes things to perfection. His characters are extremely well developed, and he manages to make the fine line between hating the ""bad guy"" (Jack Torrance) and feeling compulsion for him. It's one of those books that you can't put down until you find out what happens in the end - and you're not disappointed. I also saw the movie - it was a lot different but REALLY creepy, and the ABC Channel 7 three part miniseries is in the middle of the story right now and it's a much more accurate portrayal of the book (it actually has the hedge animals). This is an excellent summer vacation book or something to take on long airplane trips. Just don't miss out."
5,Imagine.....,"You are alone in a big dark house. All you can hear is the wind outside. There's not a single living person in fifty miles. You are trapped there...alone in the dark...You go to the library and choose a book to read. By some weird reason you take King's Shining. That was not a smart move in these conditions.The next hours find you sitting in a comfortable chair...you just can't put the book down. You are so scared that you would like to SCREAM but you'll still keep on reading.When you eventually close the book you have definately finished it. There is no way you can put it down before that. But you'll keep on sitting in this chair, too scared to move, too much overwhelmed by this book.You will never forget this night. Every time you are alone you will think about it...."
4,First time reading this k e,But I've been a SK fan for a while. I can definitely see where he matured as a writer. But this was a fun one to read.
4,Truely horrific,This is a disturbing book. But I can honestly say that I enjoyed the movie more. But still the book was great. it is the unltimate set up for a horror story with a fantastic setting and the characters struggle with sanity and surroundings is epic. It is the first Stephen King book that I have read and I was impressed with flippant aproach to the macabre. It is truely disturbing in an enjoyable fashion.
3,Not the best of Stephen King,"Although the concept was good, the content just didn't seem to do it justice. There were times that when I was reading, I just wanted to fall asleep. However, I did always wonder what was going to happen next."
5,Hair-raising; One of King's best!,"""THE SHINING"" may be long, but it's so good, you just don't want it to end! The thrills and chills never let up-and neither do the enormous words-and the surprises keep on coming! If you loved the 1980 classic film adaptation of this brilliant piece of art, you won't be disappointed!"
5,REDRUM,"This very good book is about a man named Jack Torrance who takes a job as caretaker at the Overlook hotel. His son Danny has the ability to ""shine"" or ESP. Jack is a recovering alcoholic who also is trying to write a book at the hotel. About halfway through the book, Jack goes crazy and tries to kill his wife and son. But, his plans go horribly wrong. I would reccomend this to anyone who liked ""Carrie"" or ""Misery""."
5,Horor Fan Or Not Must read this book !,"I'VE ALWAYS BEEN A STEPHEN KING FAN. BUT I THINK PEOPLE WHO NEVER LIKED HIS BOOKS WILL LIKE THIS ONE. ONSE I PICKED THE BOOK UP I COULDN'T PUT IT DOWN. THIS BOOK ISN'T DISGUSTINGLY BLOODY OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT. THIS BOOK IS CLEVER - AND BELIVE ME AFTER THE PAGE 150 OR SO IT'LL GET DEAD SCARY. ANOTHER THING THE BOOK IS NOT SLOW GOING, IN FACT IT'S VERY ACTION PACKED AND FAST GOING ! IF YOU LIKE A GOOD GHOST STORY - THIS IS IT ! Have a good scare"
5,One of his best ever,"The Shining is one of Stephen King's best ever books. He has written some of the best modern fiction in the past 35 years, and some of the worst, as well, but few of his books equal this one. This book is flat out scary and will have the hairs on the back of your neck standing on end. Some of the scenes featuring young Danny Torrance in the haunted hotel are truly gripping and will have you reaching for the light switch. Which reminds me, this is not a book to read in the dark with a flashlight. Turn the lights on, all of them. This is one scary ride, filled with believable characters, spot on dialogue, and incredibly frightening situations that will have you gripping the pages until your knuckles turn white."
5,"Stephen King does it again,DOC!","The Shining is Stephen King's very own pet monster.If Stephen King writes a cinch scarier, I think I'll move toTanjunkarang,where there aren't too many closets, dark corners or graveyards.If you're going to read THE SHINING alone, good luck!"
5,Best. Book. Ever.,"Quite simply, by far the best horror book I ever read, bar none. From the slow, methodical, foreshadowing beginning, through the increasingly scary and insightful median, and right up to the intense, explosive ending, this book creeps like no other. Characterization is excellent, and the pace is good, considering what it has to build up to. If you saw the Kubrick-slaughtered movie, you MUST read this, for it will give you ten times the insight. King's best work by far."
5,"""Here's Johnny!""","How can anyone ever forget that line from the movie! Although the movie was good, the book was better. I never pictured Jack Nicholson as the main character although he did a supurb job. The book, I believe, is a classic already. It's a heartstopper as you turn each page especially near the end when father and son are running through the hotel maze. Well worth reading."
3,The movie is actually better,This book is okay but not particularly impressive or frightening. I actually thought the Kubrick movie was better than the book. The made for TV movie though is pretty awful.
3,The Shining,This book was interesting but i liked the movie better. the only part i didn't like was the end when Jack dies in the hotel and some parts were real boring. but other then that it was a good book.
4,the shining masque of the red death?,"i don't know about you but i got REALLY sick of all the references to the 'masque of the red death' by edgar allen poe. geez, they're neverending. you hear (the Red Death held sway over all!) as much as you hear REDRUM. i liked the book but i could have done without all the references to poe's short story."
2,Definitely not one of my favorites,"I've read many of Stephen King's books, but this is one of the ones that I disliked. The book had a slow pace until like page 300. I mean the book is more about Jack's Alcoholism than the hotel. Also it didn't have that Spephen King feel. The entire book is boring. The kid has nothing to do with the book. So the hotel wants him so what whats the point of that? Anyway this is the worst Stephen King novel I've read."
5,The scariest book ever!,"I have never read another book that has scared me so much. The wonderful detail in which King writes just makes my spine tingle. Ten years after having read this book, it is still my all-time favorite, without a doubt. Absolutely amazing!"
5,If I had an extra thumb i would give this book a 3 thumbs up,"if i had to sum up this book in one word it would be SUPERB. great plot great character that you truly and deeply caredabout especially the infamous Jack who goes Psycho on his family. if i could remember this is the first stephen king book i read. I remember checking it ou from the library as was simply amazed by this book. after reading the book, i was sadly disappointed by the movie with jack nickolson. Let me make this comment on those whos have seen the movie. If you thought the movie was great than the book is by far better."
2,Love some of King's but not this one,"I think S. King is a fantastic writer and while this was well written and I was never overly excited with it. If your are looking to start reading his books I would recommend Carrie, The Dead Zone, or my all time favorite The Stand."
3,you can check in.....,"a family moves into a haunted hotel! the man is a recovering alcoholic, supposed to take care of the hotel for the winter (it's closed to public). the boy has terrible visions and some telepathic skills. there's a mother too. the hotel lies for itself....... (of course). the hotel lives. the otel tries to posess. it's actually hard to tell more. there are a lot of details and happenings here. but i would say this is more a playful story than a plot-driven. all in all, i wasn't completely satisfied with the plot. i didn't get the facts straight. there was actually quite a lot of unclearity, that's why i've never seen the acclaimed greatness. details, yes. cool happenings, yes. but exactly what/why......? for a man who likes to create plot, this wasn't that great. but it's suspenceful, lovely details, fast-paced."
3,It's OK,"It was good, but somewhat boring(it took about 3 months to finish it. I guess I ruined it by seeing the movie first. I'm glad I finished it though, I think it end better than the movie(Kubrick's I refer to)"
3,Good and thrilling,"I read The Shining, it inspired me, not being King's best work it surprised me that it wa sbetter than Carrie, i shocked by the plot an pleased with the climax, we finally find a book which is better than the film."
3,"Its ok, not the best..","Stephen King is known for writing some of the scariest stories. I read the shining, because I loved the movie from the first time I saw it. However, It is kind of boring and dull throughout the book. And at the end, all of the spooky stuff happends. A very short ending I must say, but it was still ok. I would recomend this to a person that likes the suspense to build before it attacks."
3,Not so scary,This book is okay but it needs to be more intense and scary!Every chapter ends with a so-called mystery. If you're the kind that likes down to earth horror than this book is for you!!!
2,"Boring, confusing read.","What a terrible book. There was a lot of pointless, boring drivel in the book. I was actually quite surprised that something so awful could have been written by Stephen King. From October to May, the Torrance family has to take care of the Overlook hotel with no communication to the outside world.. except for Danny's 'shining'. The idea behind the book is pretty good but the story is terrible. It jumps from past to present without the reader even knowing that. I was really disappointed when I read this book."
3,not so great,"i read this book when i was 12, thought it was the greatest thing ever. i just finished reading it again, im 32. its pretty poorly written in parts - a lot of parts. stanley kubricks film was excellent. i think this because he edited out all of the stupid, unbelievable things in the book, like the hedge animals coming to life. so ridiculous. he also added the scenes with the little ghost girls that was so much more affective than what was written in the book."
2,This is the most primitive writing that I have ever read.,"Stephen King's writing has gotten to a point where is obvious that he running out of ideas. He is clearly just writing for the money. A hotel that drives you nuts, give me a break."
2,Normally a big fan of Stephen King's story telling,"Something about Stephen King's style of story telling has always drawn me to his work - both the horror genre and otherwise. Although The Shining is one of the Stephen King classics that helped build his fan base, it just wasn't written in a voice that was true to the characters. Much of the story is told through the eyes of the telepathic 5-yr old, Danny. King failed to portray the language and thought processes of a child convincingly. The reader is forced to perceive Danny as an adult's interpretation of how a child would speak and think."
5,One of the most amazing horrors I've read yet,"I love this book, there, quick and to the point. I really love this book, the story, the characters, the setting, everything. The first time I read it, I was engrossed from the first word. The slow descent into madness, the way the house was affecting Jack, the ghosts, or were they ghosts? Everything about the story is great. I've read it eight times now, each time as good as the last. I've watched the film and the made-for-TV movie, the first movie is good, the new one is okay, but the book is the best. Great detail, characters that seem real and a story that keeps you going to the very last word, and then maybe rereading it all over again, just in case you missed anything. If you're new to horror, then this is the book to start with, if you've read it before, read it again. But you could never be a reader if you miss this book out, it really is a classic."
5,Wow,"I chose this rating because this book was just amazing. This is the fist Stephen king novel I've read, will not be the last. I don't think I've ever read a book this good. Stephen king is truly talented. I decided to read The Shining because I found the movie very good. Scratch that thought, the book makes the movie look like the producers didn't give a dank about the book. If only people didn't have to ruin amazing books with bad movies."
5,The Best Stephen King book,"This was the first Stephen King book I finished. Since then, I've read about half of his books, and thus far, this is the best one yet.While many argue that the DT series and The Stand are King's best, I think that this is by far his most successful attempt at horror. Few books have ever frightened me, but this one seriously chilled my blood. One of the most poignant aspects of ""The Shining"" is that it touches on something that everyone can relate to: isolation. While the Torrances are both physically isolated in the book, they are also emotionally isolated. King also addresses questions of madness and his influences from Lovecraft and Poe are especially evident.The book is archetypal of most of King's novels, with a fast pace and an explosive ending, but because ""The Shining"" was an early novel it avoids many King-ian cliches his more recent works have exhibited.A definite must read, both for the horror fan and non-horror fan alike."
4,I liked it,"The book was in good condition. It took a while to get to my house in Dallas, TX. I would have liked to be informed that it was shipping from ENGLAND!!! I would not have ordered it if I had known it was going to take so long to get here because it was coming from overseas. Please let the buyer know where you are shipping it from."
5,One of Stephen Kings' Well Written Book,"The Shining is one of the well written books but not the ""masterpiece"" but ranks up there; with so much suspense and horror that leaves one clinging to this book for it is indeed difficult to lay this one down once one has started to read this novel. For terror lies within and without as Stephen King is known for in his Horror / SyFy / Thriller Novels and Series it is no wonder why this became a movie itself. Of one can attain the original publication as I had which I regret selling it; for it indeed is a ""Classic Modern Day"" Horror book that is exceptionally well written where one as implied is unable to lay this book down until the end.If you read many of the 5 star and 4 star reviews; many have provided you the implications of what lurks in the shadows of this novel. A must-have for all Stephen King collectors..."
5,First Stephen King book,"This is the first book i have read, that was written by Stephen King. I have to say I was not disappointed, the book gave me something that most horror movies lack these days. A sense of love for each character and a sense of fear. We see the pain and rip in the family, and we feel for Jack even when he has gone insane. The scenes with Danny were creepy, I member having to turn the light on after reading this. While we never truly learn of why the hotel is so evil we do get enough information to feel happy with the ending.All in all i recommend this book to anyone who is a fan of horror."
4,Autobiographical Horror,"I have seen the movie, and read other Stephen King books, but for some reason I took my time getting to this one. From everything you've seen about Stephen King's personal life, you'll recognize autobiographical details in this book immediately. Having struggled with addiction myself, King excellently uses issues related to addiction and recovery in this horror medium."
5,Horrifying and Suspensful,Very good book! Horror and plot twists at every turn of the page. Only the best from the best!
5,King Scores Big,"Wow! This is one of the best Stephen King books I have read out of the ones I have read by him. It's scary when Danny is being stalked by something and when he discovers the horrible truth about room 217. It was chilling and fast-paced. Anyone who says The Shining isn't good is out of their minds. When Jack Torrance goes crazy and is assigned by Grady to kill his family, it ends up with Danny being chased on the third floor. A landmark in American Literature, to quote a review of IT."
4,Suffers because of the Movie,"I couldn't help but read this book with Kubrick's movie in mind, and it suffers because of it.On the plus side, the book offers a much deeper look at the characters, and the history of the hotel, and is written with great style.On the negative side, is that the story is pretty obvious, and takes a long time getting to its exciting finish. The movie cuts away a lot of this detail, and seems better for it. I also feel that the movie is more stylistically original, although its visuals have been copied so much in the last 30 years that it's hard to appreciate."
3,Too Much Detail,"This book couldve been so much better had a lot of inane detail been left out. It could be trimmed down to one third of its size and it would flow so much better and be so much scarier. Okay, so maybe that wouldnt make for an impressive wordy volume, but it would certainly maintain the creepy mood. Read The Masque of The Red Death by Poe and compare the two stories. King even refers to Poe's short story in his book a few times. I wish I could say The Shining was scary, but for me, it wasnt."
4,Shine On,A few years ago while staying in a hotel I was flipping through the channels and noticed that The Shining was beginning. I watched it and I thought it was an ok movie but it was nothing worth much praise. After recently buying and reading the book I noticed that I liked it much better than the movie (which is usually the case) but this is MUCH better than the movie. The movie doesn't express Danny's true powers nor does it express the evilness of the Outlook. I liked the evil hedge animals much better than the hedge maze too!
4,"Cute, but kind of large","I bought these for my daughter (7 years old), but they're a bit larger than I expected. The fairy itself is cute, though obviously nude, so be aware of that if you are purchasing for a child. I'm not sure if I'm going to give them to her this year, though, because they seem too large for her ears right now. The earrings are not heavy, and seem to be sturdy. I say ""seem to be"" because no one has worn them yet. It matches perfectly with theSterling Silver 7"" Fairy Faery Link Bracelet Jewelry, which I also bought."
4,Better than reviewed,I like the Wallflowers later stuff so I decided to give the earlier music a listen. You can hear how they've matured in their style. All around good stuff.
4,They sold Hollywood...,"This album is a very interesting debut. It's not quite on par with 'Bringing Down the Horse' but is still damn catchy. Although from the album there are few descernible singles you can really feel that with every song that the band are evolving and defining their sound. There are some standout tracks such as Hollywood and Asleep at the Wheel - sounds just like Springsteen at his best. Really - I don't regret buying this album, I very much doubt you will either."
3,Well....,"I bought this album after having Bringing Down the Horse for quite some time. I loved ""One Headlight."" After listening to this album, I concluded that I was very dissapointed. Since then I have played it every once in a while in hopes of seeing the beauty everybody claims out of it. Finally, one day, I found it. This album can be very pleasant if you give it time. I am still learning to enjoy it, but I honestly do see a little something in it that holds my attention. I only hope one day I can give it it's rightful 5 stars.The only real complaint I have that is recognizable is the fact that there is way too much piano action."
3,For those with a boundless appreciation for roots rock,"Starts off promising with ""Shy of the Moon"", a loose-limbed rocker worthy of the Silos or The Band. Alas nothing else lives up to that promise. Though there's some solid radio rock (""Ashes to Ashes"", ""After the Blackbird Sings""), and their basic sound (slightly distorted guitars, raspy vocals, splashes of piano and Hammond organ) is appealing to roots rock lovers, many of these songs just go on too long - particularly ""Somebody else's Money"" and ""Honeybee"". Those who really appreciate the no-frills bluesy rock of the Black Crowes may reserve some shelf space for this. Otherwise, stick to their breakthrough disc."
4,Back in the Beginning,"I've known for a while that this CD existed but I'd never managed to find it in stores. I should have looked it up long ago because it is a very good album. This is an interesting set, with a sort of mood to the songs that any Wallflower fan will recognize immediately. I read a review once that this album was a bit amateurish with respect to songwriting, playing and production and I'll disagree on all three accounts. Sure, the band was younger then, but this is no slap-together disc. It's pretty good, in my opinion."
3,Dylan's debut,"This debut album from the Wallflowers is hard to figure out. There are a few great songs on it (Shy of the Moon, Ashes to Ashes, After the Blackbird Sings, For the Life of Me) but the overall album seems to be missing something. There is a rushed or maybe uneasy feeling to it. Like the band isnt quite playing as one. But its worth having, especailly if you like Jakob Dylan."
1,Disappointed in this Item,"I was very disappointed in the DVD. Sabah herself is cute and perky, but this DVD seems to have been created much more for beginning dancers then the title implies.There is only one performance piece here, and it has few combinations that are new to experienced dancers.If you're new to Bellydance you might find this interesting, but if you've been dancing a while there are better DVDs for adding to your repertoire."
1,"DO NOT BUY: It's just a wire w/RJ11 phone jack & 1/8"" audio plug","This is a rather expensive piece of wire, not a ""Telephone Recording Device.""You get a phone line splitter and a cable with a RJ11 phone jack at one end and a mono 1/8"" mini audio plug at the other.If only it were so easy, but without isolating or current limiting circuitry this setup is unlikely to work, and, as a bonus, could damage your recording equipment. I tried it anyway by connecting the phone line to an iMac mic input and recording with Audacity software. The result was mostly inaudible and so noisy that Audacity's noise filter was ineffective. There was also plenty of noise on the phone handset which made conversing while recording very difficult.Other photos (elsewhere online, previously on Amazon, and in the instructions that come with the product) show a box in the middle of the wire. I assume this box contained electronics of some sort. Perhaps the 5-star ratings from other buyers were for a different item."
3,Not sure what the problem is,I'm not really sure what the problem is. I purchased this device to work on a 2 line analog phone on my desk at work. After plugging it to the phone jack and hooking the connector to my Sony Mp3 IC recorder I tried several test calls. All I got back was static. Not sure if I'm doing something wrong or if it just doesn't work with multiple line analog phone systems. Frustrating.
5,Skype compatible,hook phone to Internet to make calls throught Skype. Works very well. single earphone jack into 2 jack mic & earphone jack. u a 2 splitter & works great. I tryed many skype products. and they never worked. Hook your phone to the MIC & Ear phone Jack . u need a electric phone because ELectric dosent come form earphone jack good luck. 60.00 a year to make phone calls unlimited that includes my number. this is hard sucker to find. dont for get to buy the Slitter seperate. turning your phone into Head set the same way. A+ and works great. Dial from the pc but I use cordless phone the same way u use operater head set. plug my phone to earphone jack but mic is where voice gose in like in jack.
2,Save Your Money,"I've read 4 books on the subject and all this one is a play by play of what happened and a plug for The Malitia and Grand Puba William Cooper of the Intelligence Dept of the 2nd Constitutional Malitia. Read the book by McVeighs lawyer, Others Unknown. That is an extremely well written and insightful book. This one was a waste of my money."
3,It's okay,"It does the job, but the instructions are really bad and poorly written - obviously by someone who does not speak English. I'm glad I read the previous reviews as the reviewers all recommended that one put the unit in the AP Client Mode. Nothing in the instructions hints at that at all."
2,Excellent book/poor edition,"Benjamin has written a highly valuable book here. My concern is with Verso's treatment of it. The binding is horrible -- my edition literally fell apart on the first read. There are no annotations which, in a book as wide-ranging and dense as this, is a gross oversight. In short, a horrible edition of a great book. Find another version."
3,"Mine too, bad glue","I found this book interesting. But my book, like that of a previous reviewer, completely fell apart upon the first reading. Frustrating to have to treat my NEW book like some loose sheaf of sibylline leaves bound together with rubber bands."
5,"Would-Be Frailers, Look No Further","Not only is this the best starting-from-scratch method for frailing I've ever seen, it may be the best overall banjo method that I've seen. Beyond its helpfulness, it's filled with great photographs, and is laid out in such a friendly, completely self-explanatory manner that I can't think of a single criticism to level against it. I haven't even spotted any misprints (in that regard, it's also the best resource I've seen from the vast Mel Bay catalogue). If you're looking at learning how to play frailing, i.e. claw-hammer style banjo, start and end with this excellent resource."
1,Galaxy of Mahjongg,The Rahjongg: curse of ra is another version of the popular Curse of Ra which has 50 levels. Had I known this was in the collection - I would've said no to this cd-rom.
2,"Fun in concept, kind of lame in reality.","This track was a must have when I imagined my son playing with his hamsters. In reality, the hamster has to go in the ""right"" direction to make the ball go on the track. They get bored, crawl into a ball and go to sleep. I find the hardwood floor is much easier for them to get some momentum and actually exercise.The way the track attaches is with cheap plastic tongue/grooves. I had to use a sharp knife to open up two of them enough to insert the next track piece. Very cheaply made and not much fun at all. It now just sits half contructed under my son's bed taking up space because I don't have the heart to throw away $20..."
4,Great toy for race lovers,"This track is great for anyonw with one lazy and one hyperactive hamster. That lazy hamster will be pushed to exercise by the other hamster pushing her around! Its great to see my hamster which always sleeps doing something for once!It's also a great toy for those people who love races, just set up a straight line and watch em go!"
3,Hamtrac,"My Dwarf didn't seem to like this much at all, but it is a nice place to put her if I need to clean her cage and not have to worry about her the whole time. The pieces are relativity easy to put together, but kind of hard to pop off. I recommend this for only people who's pets love running in circles, because my Mid tries her hardest to get off and it's very pathetic, to tell you the truth."
3,Race Track,It was easy to put together. It supports both the small balls for the gerbils and hamster and large ball for the chinchilla.We have both. The hamster and chinchilla did roll around on the track.
1,The Willow has Withered,"If you are looking for The Wind in the Willows, keep looking because this is not it. All the British terminology has been removed, most of the references to things British have been removed, all references to guns & knives have been removed (but they left in the picture of Ratty entering Toad Hall with gun in hand), the entire chapter with Pan--one of the most enchanting in the entire book--has been removed, and most references to other literature (such as the chapter title ""The Return of Ulysses"") have been removed.What's left? Not much. The story has been so altered as to take all the life out of it. Supposedly this has been done to make the story more accessible to young American readers. To which I reply, let the young American readers work their way up to Wind in the Willows under the tutelage of parents or teachers who love the real story and then give the original version of the book to the children. Wind in the Willows is a wonderful book but this version is not."
4,Excellent,This is one of the best books/series I have ever read! I special ordered the second one ('Millenium's Dawn') right after it came out to be sure I had a copy and I didn't even about know the third one('Doomsday Flight')until I happened to see it in a bookstore and I bought it right away. All three are first-rate Christian fiction!
5,The only UB40 CD worth owning...,"24 years old and still an underrated album that stands the test of time. I dig this out and play it at parties or on road trips and am amazed how people of all ages love it. I purposely don't mention that it's UB40 and friends are stunned to learn that UB40 are highly talented and are more than capable of just re-hashing other well-known reggae/pop songs.I'm surprised that other bands have never covered, (or maybe someone has?), some of the songs on this pioneering album like 'Tyler' 'Burden of Shame' 'King' or 'Madam Medusa.'If you like solid and original reggae that's not 'Marleyesque' you won't be disappointed with this CD."
5,"Forget their ""hits""...buy this!",Hard to believe that this disc is made by the same guys who made all those banal covers...I was blown away when I heard this cd! Buy Signing Off and Present Arms if you want to hear the essence of UB40.
5,a classic,"all I can tell you is this:I been listening reggae for the last 40 years(yes,I said 40)and this its the best ub40 ,...bob marley its really happy in the heaven!!!"
5,Their best,"Why did UB40 move on to Red, Red Wine? Excellent album, good for any mood, and will keep you going on bad days. Gets better and better the more you listen to it."
5,Signing off,"This album is still my favourite album.I Love the different style of Reggae on this album,You've got Ali's awesome voice,Astro bold toasting and the beautful dub sounds. Signing off Sir2000@yahoo.com"
1,"Garbage, agree","Worst piece of hardware I have used. Installed by a contractor in my bathroom pocket door, it's the most annoying, useless, polished-brass-combined-with-nylon-push-buttons-pocket-door-latch. I'm replacing it right away."
1,Garbage,Bought this at Home Depot. Easy enough to install. But the lock is horrible and does not work. Very confusing to users also.
3,Ménage à quatre,"In the mid-1970s, Jean-Luc and his wife Irène are living in Charlottesville, Virginia, where Jean-Luc teaches. Finding a lack in their relationship, each begins an affair, and eventually their respective girlfriends (Chantal and Mouse) move into the large house with them. The initial tensions and aggravations eventually give way to a sort of bonhomie as the four non-Americans plan and give a large party. It's an intriguing novel about foreigners in America, whose third part shines with Porter's writing. The earlier portions of the book, however, contain awkward dialogue and a torpid story which almost swallows the characters whole. ""Resident Aliens"" is a challenging book about the maturation of love between these four people."
1,adult humor so beware,"I bought this for my 6 yr old and 4 yr old. It is slow moving, depressing and all around BORING. They sat through 15 minutes and asked to turn it off.Worst of all, this has obvious adult humor. Luckily, my kids didn't pick up on it. DO NOT buy this for children."
3,HO HO HUM,"I guess I had too high expectations for this movie so felt a little let down after/while watching it. I remember thinking to myself ""it's going to get better"" but sadly it never did. Maybe because I was comparing it to the greats of a similar nature such as Rudolph, Frosty, and The Year Without a Santa Claus. I'm sure young kids will still like it, but just don't expect too much if you are an adult and rememeber some of the films i just mentioned. animation is nice."
3,Not the Real Asphalt Ballet!!,"I have to say it may be a bit pre-mature. But this is not the same Asphalt Ballet as on the previous album. At first glance it doesn't ring wtih the same attitude, and there must be a different singer. As with most bands just starting they are doomed to try and change there sound or change to reach for record sales(Like SAXON in the late eighties). I hope it grows on me like Unlucky Mr. Lucky...Tuesday Rain!!!Chewee"
5,Northern Minnesota,"The other reviews on the DVD is what convinced me to buy it - they were right! This is a wonderful fireplace DVD. Growing up in Northern Minnesota a fire was common, now living in Chicago this DVD brings me a piece of home. I would caution that there is one loud snap/pop that made me jump. After the first time I noticed it much less."
3,FIREPLACE,OK fireplace video...found one in Walgreen's for $2 the same day I happened to order this one and find it to be better quality...who figured?
5,New Fan,"What an incredible find. On the advice of my 14 year old, I listened. I loved. With lyrics bright and energetic, Ben Folds engages me to not only listen, but to feel and identify, argue or agree with him. Not one to paint a rosy picture, but one to help me look courageously at a true picture, Folds is a genius in lyric and song. I am a fan forever. A ""must give"" on the Christmas list!!"
4,It'll Grow On Ya,"When I first heard this album, I thought it was just okay. It left me pining for the ""Rockin' The Suburbs"" days, though. I'm a sucker for techno-y touches and faster songs with catchy melodies. After listening to Ben's newest album for the third time, however, the subtle touches and smooth melodies made their way into my head, and I can't stop listening to the album. I'm now impressed, but not totally blown away, which results in my 4 star rating. There isn't really a defining moment to the album, there is no cresendo, climax, or high point. Still, songs such as ""Jesusland"", ""Gracie"", and ""Give Judy My Notice"" are charming and filled with beautiful lyrics that you'll want to hum along to soon enough. The DVD included provides a lot of insight on the album, and Ben's new bass and drums players. All in all, you get your money's worth, if only for the beautiful hardbound book the special package edition comes in (with)."
5,Another strong addition to the Folds Catalogue,"I honestly thought ROCKIN THE SUBURBS was overrated: it had its share of good songs but it was definitely over-produced, while the songs were not up to Folds' usual standard. Songs for Silverman can be most compared to his 1999 album Unauthorized Biography of Reinhold Messner with its low-key Paul Simon inspired feel. I thought this was really good, but it!"
5,Classic high quality Ben Folds,This is his best album since Forever and Ever Amen. You will not be disappointed. Make sure you buy the EPs as well. They are great too.
1,Dual Disc just another record co. hype,"If I could actually hear this CD in any of my D players I could give it a rating. I bought two CD's that I've been excited about new Springsteen and the Ben...I can only play the dual disc on my home CD player and of course DVD player, cars a no go, my mac won't even see them so I can't iPod them. Probably just what the record company is counting on! They want us to buy into the hype of the dual spend the money and then re-up for a cd or pay for it on line AGAIN just so we can pay twice for the same material, cut the greed for the music's sake. Buy the way it's not like I'm giving it a go on outdated players, one car is a 2002 with dealer stereo other is a 2001 with an Alpine changer bought just 3 years ago. iMac is only 3 years old as well...welcome to yet another ""great"" technology that only has you buying more and more and more stuff."
5,Where have I been,"I am unsure as to how I missed knowing of Ben Folds. Simply amazing and traditionally not a piano enthusiast, I can't get enough of his talent."
3,Boring,"This is not a good album from Ben in my opinion. It's boring and kind of sappy. It's not smart, or fun or really good like his other stuff. There's only two songs I really like "" Jesusland"" and ""Landed"". The song ""Gracie"" is about his daughter I think it's a nice song for her but I think he should of left it off the album and kept it just between them. It's kinda uncomfertable to listen to it. The rest of the album is nothing impressive."
4,"Good album, but Ben is getting middle aged","The tunes are catchy and some are even good, but I don't find any of the music special. There was always an edge to Folds' music, something he was rebelling against or exploring.However, in this album Ben reaches middle age, writing songs about his daughter and other tunes with good melodies but otherwise unmemorable. If you are a fan, certainly get this and add it to your collection. You will like it and listen to it many times. But this isn't the CD you pull out when you want to share Ben Folds with someone who doesn't know him. Then you pull out Rockin' the Suburbs or Whenever and Ever. Even his LP, Sunny 16, has a bit more variety than this album even though that had only 5 songs.It is good to grow up and not all songs can be about high school or one's teenage years. Bruce Springsteen remained relevent during such a transition, Billy Joel did not. Ben's following Mr. Joel's path."
1,Defective CD,"Bought this disc at Best Buy. It did not play in my cd player. I have heard from many people that it will not play for them either. I would like to give a better review but I have not heard the album and probably never will. Pity, I enjoyed everything that Ben Folds has done up until this point."
2,Music Without Music,"This is GREAT?! A music CD that doesn't play on 'some'(meaning mine/maybe yours) CD player. What an interesting idea. I can play it on my computer and on one car player, but I'd like to listen to it EVERYWHERE, it's not like you're buying it for 1/2 price!"
2,Decent CD but BEWARE!!!,"The music is pretty good (though still not as good as Ben Folds Five), and the DVD features are kind of a cool bonus. But frankly, I would rather have had just the music in a format that would play on all my CD players. The audio side would only play on 2 of the 4 players I tried it on (haven't tried my car yet which is obviously important)."
5,One of his best.,"By ""his best"", I acknowledge that he's only done one by himself before, but this also refers to his Folds Five stuff before that.This is, currently, the CD that I can't put away. While I've been a Ben Folds ""listener"" for quite a while, I suppose that this wouldn't be that big of a surprise. The songs are great, ranging from melancholy (Late) to upbeat (Jesusland). My favorite on it are, in order: Sentimental Guy, Trusted, and You To Thank. That's just a start though, since there are so many other songs that stand out, like Gracie, Prison Food, etc.I would recommend this as the starter CD for anyone who's interested in this kind of music. This is the definitive Ben Folds, and I would rank it much higher than the already great Rocking the Suburbs.If you've heard of Ben Folds, buy this album.Well, even if you haven't, buy this album anyways."
1,DualDisc - AVOID,"While I love Ben Folds as a performer, I was unfortunately unable to get this album to work correctly in my computer. The non-DVD side refused to mount, making it impossible to transfer the songs to my iPod. After reading more about DualDisc, I found out that because of the way it is designed, it is A) impossible to predict whether or not a DualDisc will work in your CD player--even if one DualDisc works, another might not, and even brand new CD players can have trouble--and B) it may actually DAMAGE your CD player! Ridiculous! If they can't even guarantee that it will work, why bother selling it? If you want a product that is actually reliable, AVOID THIS RELEASE and purchase something that actually follows CD standards. I find it insulting that Sony only made the CD version available in its ""special package"" release, which costs much more."
5,A modern classic,"No, for his new album Ben Folds did not decide to import strange electronic noises and trippy sound effects; neither did he decide to make a stadium rock record that would sell trillions of copies. Instead he did what he did best:made an album in his traditional piano trio style with some of the best songs of his career. No it won't ever be highest selling album of all time, but it will be looked upon in twenty years as Folds' finest hour. Listen to songs such as Landed, Jesus Land, and Late and you'll know what I mean."
5,Brilliant pop music,"I had heard from many friends that as a huge Billy Joel/Elton John fan (well at least Elton pre-""Less than Zero"") that I had to get into Ben Folds. I had heard ""Rocking the Suburbs"", and while I liked it I wasn't blown away or anything, except for a few songs. But after receiving this album as a birthday gift, I can now say I am a devout fan of Mr. Folds. Anyone who is a fan of very melodic, chorus-concentraded pop music will love this album. Most of these songs remind me of Elton circa-""Madman Across the Water"" and Todd Rundgren circa-""Something/Anything?"". For the most part, the melodies are absoultely gorgeous, the lyrics intelligent and subtle, and the musicanship and prodcution top-notch. This confirms to me that Ben Folds is, along with Jeff Tweedy, Miles Kurosky, James Mercer, and Elliot Smith; among the best pop songwriters of the past 10 years."
4,A pleasant surprise,"Now, like most modern Ben Folds fans, I tapped into this amazing musician during his time with the Five, for Whatever and Ever Amen.I don't really feel that this is much of a departure from that album. Although the little blurb is correct, this picks up right where Rockin' the Suburbs left off.Ben exhibits a nack at making almost anything sound emotional and heartfelt. Whether it's calling someone a Bastard, or describing getting wasted, he tacks on a bit of tear-duct to every song.My favorites from this disc surprised me, to be honest. Bastard, You To Thank, Landed...they are all good songs. But the real good songs here are Gracie, Trusted, and Time. I can't describe it really, I just feel it. I get lost in these songs.Maybe you just need to get this, to understand..."
5,Buy if you're already into Ben Folds,"THIS ALBUM IS BRIMMING WITH TALENT FROM BEGINNING TO END. I've always been a huge Ben Folds fan. However, I must be a realist. If you have never heard of Ben Folds this is not the album to start with. I actually REALLY got into Ben Folds after hearing the ""Ben Folds Live"" CD. You can really hear what he can do to a piano and it's so exciting to hear! In my OWN opinion, this is an album for already loyal followers of Ben Folds. This album shows more of the songwriting side of Ben Folds, unlike some of his previous work which places more of an emphasis on his piano playing skills (don't get me wrong though. Those songs are incredibly well written!!!). In the end, I say this is well worth a purchase for any Ben Folds fan. I'm not saying you WON'T like it if you're not a Ben Folds fan already. I'm saying it will be MUCH more enjoyable if you've heard his previous work before you hear this album."
1,DualDisc technology is LAME. Beware!,"Music: 4 stars...very good album from Ben Folds. But unfortunately, the audio side of the DualDisc doesn't work in my Apple G5. The DVD side works but I'm not able to import the audio into itunes. So if you're planning to load the songs into itunes then download it into your ipod, forget it. In fine print at the bottom of the jewel case it says, ""the audio side of this disc does not conform to CD specifications and therefore not all DVD and CD players will play the audio side of this disc."" Of course, you don't know this until Amazon sends you the CD since they don't display the warning on the page. Be forewarned."
1,I only wish I could listen to it...,"This dual-disc won't play in my home stereo. I have a rather new (<6 months old) RCA CD/DVD unit and when I put in the disc it just says 'incompatible disc'. I suppose I could run the DVD side, but since I have no TV attached, I cannot navigate the menus.I can understand artists wanting to prevent their work from being pirated, but when you lock out your loyal fan base who actually purchase your discs, you may have gone too far!"
3,DualDisc won't play in Macs,"Forget about importing the CD to iTunes to put it on your iPod - your mac will spit out the disc as soon as you put it in. Otherwise, great album."
2,Not so modern,"This book is ok as a guide to familiarise yourself with the conjugation patterns. However, it is 20 years out of date and carries out dated accents/breathings on the Greek text. It could also have been laid out better and used a better font. I would recommend using this book alongside a good grammar reference guide."
1,This is insane,"This book is nearly impossible to use! Even my greek teacher says so. Sure, it has 100 conjugations for each verb but there is NO english that explains them!!!! It lists the word, then the definition and then 100 conjugations and doesn't tell you what each conjugation means.If you speak greek, I could see using this book. If you a re learning it as a second language like me, find something else. Unless you want to buy mine!Ìéáéò"
3,OK....but....,"The book is very useful to students of modern Greek. However, I found two deficiencies that I found annoying: first, the names of the verb tenses were difficult to understand since they did not correspond to previous names of tenses that I have learned in Greek and other languages; second, some very common verbs (e.g., ""come"" and ""pay"")were not included, when some very obscure verbs were."
4,Chinese New Year Book for Kids,"I am an elementary music teacher, and I used the story/picture book to supplement our music class activity on Chinese New Year and Chinese folk songs. The kids really liked the book in 1st and 2nd grade, and the pop-ups were well done. Since we have a non-Chinese population, but more Vietnamese at our school, the Chinese words didn't make sense to the students, but we figured it out--Happy Chinese New Year."
5,Fun book for preschoolers,"Joan Holub's Dragon Dance: A Chinese New Year Lift-the-Flap Book is a popular one. Each page has 4 lines of simple text in a classic ABCB rhyming pattern (hope that's right...trying to remember 7th grade English class) with good sized flaps to open to reveal some part of the New Year celebration, supposedly one in New York City's Chinatown (though it wouldn't have to be). Colorful and bold illustrations include little ""extras"" you can point out--the significance of the flowers, the oranges, and the super long noodles. Only complaint? The last flap ends with ""Gung Hat Fat Choy!"" in big ole print which is Cantonese rather than the Mandarin ""Xin Nian Kuai Le!"" New Year's greeting - something that really bothered my Mandaring-learning 7 year old.See my reviews for a bunch of CNY kids' books on my blog [....]- look for the post from January 25, 2012"
4,Nice explanation of Chinese New Year,"I bought this book for my nieces and nephews, and my daughter's school, to give the kids some background on Chinese New Year in advance of parties at our house and school. My daughter is too young to understand the words, but loves to lift the flaps and the bright colors of the book."
3,Not enough old films.,"Unfortunately this is mainly about restored locomotives for tourist lines. I have nothing against that but I would prefer the old graining black and white films of working locomotives and not the restored tourist attractions. Perhaps that's just me. I was spoiled by ""When Giants Roamed"" and think all videos should be similar."
4,Rambam & Judaism,"Kellner's book accurately but dispassionately summarizes some of the controversies that swirled around the Rambam in the middle ages. If you want to understand why Maimonides is still considered controversial in some circles, read this work."
2,Inaccurate and Unconvincing,"Kellner puts together a hodgepodge of ideas, most of them correct on their own but entirely wrong when grouped together, and tries to create a new approach. His approach is entirely un-new and internally inconsistent. In trying to combine traditional talmudism and Jewish philosophy with his own brand of pluralism, Kellner ends up with an ill-defined mixture that does not sustain even the most basic analysis. As Dr. David Berger wrote in his review of this book (Tradition, 33:4 1999), ""While significant elements of Kellner's argument are convincing, others, I think, are flawed to the point where they render the historical thesis misleading and the contemporary message, for all its good intentions, confusing and unworkable."""
2,Moeller Fuel Tank Install Kit,"I purchased a Moeller Fuel Tank and the seperate install kit. The hoses in the install kit are way too short to do anything with (I gave mine away), so the kit becomes too expensive. Buy the filler fitting, the vent and some hose clamps and you're further ahead. You'll have to purchase proper lengths of fuel fill and vent hoses anyway (or use your old ones)."
2,dont fit !,"The hoses in this set up didn't work for my application. I have a 17"" aluminum TX Tournament Bass Tracker. The original built in gas tank had to be replaced and i replaced it with a Moeller tank. This tank installation kit that was recomended by Amazon comes with everything to set the tank up, but the hoses are way to short to work on my boat!! I did read this in other peoples reviews but took a chance anyway. Well, big dissapointment!! It cost me an additional $45 to purchase hoses to make the tank fill-up work. Add that to the cost of the kit already purchased that didn't work, kind of a waste of money!! The hoses are 1 standard size (short)and not spacific to any application. Unless the gas cap is installed directly above the gas neck on the tank, then the hose supplied will not work.Unfortunatly they are not lined up one directly under the other on my boat. My boat came with a fill cap/spout factory installed, i wasn't going to put in another one just to make the short hoses work."
2,very dated,"I ordered this book because Arthur Clarke referred to it in one of his books, said it was very well-written and funny. However, it's very dated, really predictable, and not at all funny. The concept of mind control gone awry was newer then when people were beginning to realize the kind of mind control exercised by marketing gurus. This is ""How to Succeed in Business"" pitted against ""Elmer Gantry"" struggling over the power of virtual reality, although they didn't call it that then.It's interesting to me that none of the science fiction stories I have ever read, and I've read a lot of them, had accurate predictions about the personal computer. It's very strange to read a book set in the future that doesn't mention the internet or laptops. In this book computers are still described as behemoths with those cards with holes in them..."
5,this book changed my life,"I am an immigrant from South America, where everyone from cab drivers to politicians has a flavor for poetry. When I saw the ""guerilla"" title of this book, I was intrigued, and so I bought it. However, what I found inside was quite amazing. Instead of the militant rantings I expected, I discovered some of the most gut-wrenching, raw, and beautiful poetry I have come accross in contemporary American writing. I did not think that this element of spirit existed in poetry today. I would recommend this book to anyone who ""thinks"" they like poetry, and even more to everyone who ""thinks"" they don't."
5,One of the best collections of poetry I've read.,"From Zachary Dempster's abstract visuals, Alex Gang's subtle humor, James Leon Suffern's and Matthew Moon's vocal wordslinging, Jen Makholm's postmodernist word play, John Kersey's storytelling, Matt Levy's linguistic brillance, and the duel poetic geniuses of Janaka Stucky and Scott Creney, this is one of the best collections of young poets to grace the American stage."
1,Horrid illustrations and rather boring text,"My kids crave far more information than this book provided. They would have like more photographs of this famous man, not cartoonish, childish illustrations."
3,3/5 no mas que eso,"Un album que empieza con las 2 mejores canciones del album tocado por LOS DUENOS DEL SON. Despues la cancion homenaje de Celia Cruz ha sido retomado de la cancion TE LO DIJE de Tabaco y Ron pero han cambiando la letras para dedicar la cancion a Celia Cruz. ALC toca solomente Son, no es salsa por nada y KUERO es un poco rara como musica cuando esperas escuchar salsa de verdad como dice lo titulo DIMELO CON SALSA. Definitivamente, las 2 primeras canciones son increible buena.POr eso les doy 3/5 cause of that 2 songDAve"
3,Lacks Interest,"The members of Eight Prime are planning a haunted house to continue to raise money for the purchase of a bus for the program Peter heads up with his friend Chris.In Promises, Promises we find out what Miguel's been hiding. He scoffs at Peter's telling him that he'd be praying.Peter usually asks Jenna to the homecoming dance which they attend as friends. She's distracted as to why he hasn't asked her yet to this year's homecoming.Melanie seems interested in Peter. The only thing Jesse seems interested in is getting back on the football team after being caught with liquor in his locker.This one in the series seems to be missing something. Or else it's merely that there's nothing which draws the reader's interest."
5,The best series books ever to come!!!!!!!!,"I'm 13 and I think these books are the best for alomost any age between 12-18! They are so good, but have sort of a soap opera twist. ( which to me makes it even way cooler!) I'd would recommend this book to any teen, no matter boy or girl!!!! Almost everyone in my class is hooked on it and so would you, and if you haven't given it try please do! It is DE BEST!"
3,Almost a four star,"Fire, Burn! is definitely a unique story. As usually, Ms Hart writes beautifully and her plot is well thought out. The hero and heroine were charming and believable. However, compared to Jasmine on the Wind (a masterpiece), I'd have to give Fire, Burn! almost four stars only. And the reason is: I wished the romance between the two characters was more in the forefront. Don't get me wrong, when they were together there were definitely sparks flying. But I would have loved to see a little more interaction btwn the two. I just felt as if their romance was secondary to the plot, which should have been there to aid the romance btwn the leading characters, not overshawdow it.Because Jasime on the Wind was such a wonderful story (one of my favorites of all time), I am still a huge fan of MDH. She has a natural and flowing way of writing and her books are never your typical everyday sappy romance stories. I look forward to her next novel, and hope that it compares to Jasmine."
4,Tom Weaves more fun for fans!!!,Another compilation of Tom Weaver very interesting interviews for all Sci Fi/Horror Movie fans and collectors.Tom covers interviews with some greats (and some not so well known contributors) for the much appreciative Sci Fi/Horror fan.All interviews in Tom's pre published articles are combined in another great read which is a must buy for all us fans of the genre.Thanks to Tom and McFarland publishing.
3,"Simple Text, Poor Presentation, Incomplete Sentences, Old Maple Version","This review is of Kindle edition.The textbook attempts to present the material in easy to understand manner with hands-on Maple exercises. It is a good attempt, but is still incomplete.At places Maple exercises are without any explanation. At many places there is no discussion after the Maple exercise. Maple commands also need a bit more introduction. The book uses Maple stats package, which is being replaced by Statistics in newer version. This is not authors fault, but it needs revision to attract new readers.Also at several places the English grammar needs work. There are many incomplete sentences which makes reading those passages hard.In Kindle edition, many equations are not showing up correctly. So I would recommend the paper edition."
3,Satisfactory OEM replacement for S2000,"I installed two of these on the front of my S2000 with new Hawk HPS pads. I followed proper bed-in procedure. This rotor/pad combo had slightly lesser stopping power than the OEM parts, but this can be explained by the HPS pads and the rather aggressive OEM Honda pad compound. As for the rotors, they have very mild warping after 12,000 miles, and the OEM rotors never warped. The car sees some autocross and plenty of exuberant mountain road driving (until the break fade forces me to slow down). I am careful to let the breaks cool before stopping in one place. Hope this helps."
5,Australian Gold,"I read this book in Year 12 at high school. What I liked about it is the pursuit of higher achievement and the reality that life has its share of victories and disappointments. The fact that the book has a slightly pessimistic ending should not be taken as a negative. The truth of life is that there are endeavours we would have all liked to have enjoyed greater interest and success in, and this book allows for the presentation of the good and bad that is featured in a lifetime. The fact that he has a wandering eye approaching mid-life may only mean that he THINKS his life could be better; an oversight a person can sometimes fall into during stages of frustration.Nicholas R.W. Henning - Australian Author"
4,Beautifully written,"I read Maestro for my Year 11 Related English class and it is one of those rare books that is greatly enhanced once studied. Many people feel unsatisfied by the ending and think the book was altogether too short, but that is the very skill of Goldsworthy. His writing is beautifully crisp; there is not a superfluous word in the entire novel. His writing is rich with symbolism. While the book explores many themes, Paul's journey from callow arrogance to painful recognition of his own mediocrity affected me the most. This is one of the most refreshing Australian novels I have ever read."
5,A zen parable,"Ever wanted to be a musician? In Darwin, Australia (the main town nearest to Crocodile Dundee)?No, well Goldsworthy teleports you there without the humidity, isolation and ennui. Having been a musician in Darwin myself, I thought ""How could any publisher possibly be interested in a story about a musician in Darwin?"". Well, Goldsworthy's technique surpases the subject matter. Nazi sympathizers, finding a place to ""bonk"" in the botanical gardens and the frustration of knowing that there is always someone who can play better than you are intertwined like some mythical zen parable leading the reader to question whether their ""life has been wasted following an impossible dream"". All very probable for Darwin but described like an Escher scetch: ""perfume which consumed me like some sort of like sexual solvent""."
3,"Oops, Goldsworthy forgot to finish it!",During your first reading of Maestro you are pulled into the world of the characters and the mesmerising plots and subplots. All readers can find an element which srikes a chord within themselves but will inevitably be left confused and questioning by the unresolved ending. A second read is neccesary to find what seems to have been left out of the final chapter and the novel continues to linger on an unresolved chord.
3,A good story with a hopeless ending.,"Even though this book was quite funny and interesting to read, I was disappointed by the ending. All the way through I thought 'will the main characters turn their lives into something worthwhile?', and of course, I knew they had to, for the book to be given so much praise, but the ending left the characters lifeless and despairing. Overall, a depressing book."
4,Best Popcorn - Best Popcorn Machine I've Ever Used,"The other types of popcorn makers were the very old fashioned oil type, which melted the plastic bowl, and various air poppers which made a very dry product.This popper completely popped 95% of the kernels, was quick (about three minutes for a full serving), and the results are delicious. It is worth its price. It is well designed and the plastic container can be used as a serving vessel.I've had it a few days, and I'll never pop corn in a pan again. This thing works great!"
1,I really don't think this doll was all that.,"I really don't think this doll was all that. A couple months ago I found her at Toys'r'Us. They had about 20 of them on clearance for about $15 dollars. I love the show, and remember the episode so I contimplated purchasing her. I studied the doll carefully in it's box and thought to myself, I already own so many truly beautiful dolls, would this one be a great addition to my collection. I decided no. Maybe if she would of been made with the Barbie Collector molds? I hate her Bratz huge alien head and she just looked too much like a toy, not like something I would like to display as part of my collection."
4,An Entertaining Romp Through the History of Music,"""Bach, Beethoven and the Boys"" is a quick and fun read, particularly for someone who already knows a thing or two about music history. Author David W. Barber's attempt to show some of the great classical composers as regular guys is refreshing. Unfortunately, his impartiality falters from time to time, such as in the sections on Wagner, opera, and twentieth century music. There are also a couple of factual errors and occasional passing references to a composers without further explanation (such as Mahler), and Barber's penchant for putting most of his funny lines in footnotes becomes annoying after a while.This is not a book for introducing children or students to music history. It would be most enjoyable for someone who is already somewhat knowledgeable about music history."
5,"Fun, but not that funny....","Barber's book was fun, but not all that funny. Some parts invoke a robust chuckle, while other parts were quite lame. But I suppose that is the point. I paid [good money] for this book. In hindsight, it's hardly worth it. I think the glossy cover is to blame. I'd be much more enthusiastic if I paid what the book is actually worth, ... With that said, if you are determined to add this to your library I'd sincerely recommend searching your local used book store for this gem."
1,Facts or slander?,"It was my impression that the point of this book is to ""demythologize"" (or should that be denigrate?) the great composers. Although it is informative in a very lightweight and breezy way, it also presents some rather dubious statements as if they were commonly accepted facts (best example: ""Beethoven had syphilis"") in an off-handedly casual way that does not encourage readers to question the source. Separating the fact from the fiction in this book is no simple chore, so don't start here if what you want is real information. If you want to feel justified in treating classical composers with disdain, this book will certainly help."
3,Solid Book,I had to purchase this book for class. Barely used it but had no issues when I did. Solid Book.
1,Too sarcastic. Music lovers only.,"Billed as ""music history as it ought to be taught,"" Bach, Beethoven, and the Boys offers a sarcastic, familiar, whirlwind tour of the greats from music history. As pleasure reading, the book offers a number of great details and funny stories from the way-side of history. As a textbook, the details about most musicians are trivial, the important stuff, forgettable, and the prose, too sarcastic to tell genuine from jest. In all, a rather frivolous read that music lovers would enjoy and everyone else would likely fail to appreciate.Continued at: [...]"
2,"Doesn't do the ""boys"" justice.","Most of this book is limited to very brief biographical summaries of pop culture composers. Barber also seemed to be trying a little bit too hard to be humourous, and his frequent banteresque footnotes were distracting and for the most part unncesessary. This book IS good for a general overview of composers and as a very sparse outline of Western music's greatest composers."
4,Herbal Menstrual Aid,"I thought the product was everything it said it was and was recommended by my physician. I just didn't review the ingredients and it had too much Vitamin C and even though it was buffered I have interstitial cystitis and can not use that much at once, but it does not always affect individuals unless they are extremely sensitive."
1,Unfortunately,"I've struggled with heavy menstration for as long as I can remember. I found this product and was eager to try it. Unfortunately it did nothing to help my heavy bleeding, I guess I'll keep searching."
4,"Bangles meet the Ramones, sung by Japanese Barbie wannabes.","Shonen Knife makes Aqua look like Jethro Tull. This Japanese trio mixes bright, melodic pop with positively surreal lyrics, enhanced by the deeply fractured English. Songs like 'Twist Barbie' (a paean to Barbie that pre-dates the infamous Aqua song) and 'Flying Jelly Attack' (with its chorus of 'jelly jelly jelly jelly jelly jelly jelly beans') make up in sheer irrepressible good humour what they lack in lyrical sophistication. But like anything else that's sweet and fizzy, Shonen Knife rapidly becomes cloying. It's a good antidote to the evening news, but not a CD you'll be listening to on continuous loop (unless you want your sugar-shocked neighbours to start pounding on the walls)."
3,What happened to Shonen Knife's old sound?,"i guess when SK gets a big-name label, some producer has to mess around with their original cool sound and try to make them sound mainstream or whatever. some of the songs are remakes of their old tunes, and these remakes are a far cry from the originals. i recommend anyone interested in SK to get one of their first three albums... they're much better than this."
4,"Good ring, but it leaves a ring.","Love this ring. The stars are about as dark as pictured. Very comfortable although it feels thick to me. But I have small hands so that could just be me. My only complaint is it does turn my finger grey (Sterling Silver does that, I know, but it is annoying.) But I've heard after I wash it a few times and wear it in that should go away.Overall? Sturdy and for a good price!"
2,Not up to the task,"Nice idea, but the plastic cracked in multiple places. Simply unable to handle anything other than light loads at warm temperatures."
4,Great rust free cart,"I got tired of replacing metal wheel barrels every 3-5 years (due to their large size and my very crowded garage, I had to prop them up against the house where the trashcans are stored). I bought this at my local Lowes for under forty dollars at their end of season sale. Previous to this item's purchase, I purchased a plastic wheelbarrow at Sam's for 80, but the handles and hardware started to rust by the end of summer. I had put car wax on the metal parts while assembling so I was disappointed at the poor outcome. So the main feature I like about this cart is all visible parts are plastic. I use it for hauling raked leaves, mulch, decorative bricks, and moving shrubs/trees/plants, etc. Except for a few scratches, it still looks like new. I dinged it one star since if it is filled w/ less wt. than it states it can safely carry the wheels seem hard to roll. If it had 4 plastic wheels or even 2 air filled rubber ones I think it would be much easier to maneuver."
5,Early review,"I just purchased the 3 cu cart today at Home Depot. It was marked down from $39.99 to $19.99. I wanted to buy two, and I still may go back and get another, but I was thrilled by the price. So far, I love this thing."
5,ROLL ON,"I HAD ONE OF THESE FOR 5 YEARS. (MY DAUGHTER BORROWED IT AND LOADED IT WITH PEA GRAVEL AND TORE IT UP) BUT FOR ANYONE WHO DOESN'T LIKE TO LIFT, BUT JUST ROLL, IT'S A LIFE SAVER. 4-5 40 LB BAGS OF COMPOST, JUST ROLLS GREAT. THE PICTURE SHOWS GREEN, BUT MINE ARRIVED GRAY. FINE BY ME."
3,Don't you love Yakuza movies?,"I also bought this movie because of the game. The games are great and so in depth. The movie was not really what i expected. it's very loosely tied to the game. Nishiki and Fuma are barely in the plot. its seems like Kazuma just ""runs"" into trouble, but really has no ties to these characters.Kazuma and Nishiki don't even look like their characters, nor do they even look Japanese. I DO like that they have little ""funnies"" from the game here and there like the energy drink, which causes him to power up with a blue aura. Also, Yoo Gong is hot, but I really don't remember his role in any of the games.It's fun to watch if you're into the game, but other's may find the story very choppy. Or maybe none fans will just enjoy the movie for what it is. Although it's not the best movie, i still enjoyed it."
3,Answers Are Wrong,"I'm using this product at the moment and the DVD's section on analytical reasoning is occasionally wrong. How am I supposed to trust a product that thus far (I'm twenty minutes into the DVD) has had two questions where the teacher has explained answers incorrectly or failed to use all of the premises that the question sets out. If you are curious which one I am specifically referring to it is the first and last questions in the Harold, Maude, and Lloyd activity's analytical reasoning game. The guide has been helpful but this is driving me crazy."
2,Disappointed,"As a former The Princeton Review teacher, I automatically bought this book when I decided to take the LSAT. I truly believed that TPR was the best test prep out there, and that using real test questions is the only way to learn how the testmakers think.I was stunned when I found in Chapter 2 of this book an example of an argument (i.e. Logical Reasoning) question that uses an incorrect assumption in its ""correct"" answer choice. That's when I found out that The Princeton Review doesn't use real test questions like it used to when I coached other tests. That's when I put down this book and ordered books from Powerscore, which does license real test questions from the Law School Admission Council, and the LSAC's own Official LSAT Test Prep books, which contain actual LSATs.The DVD, while professionally done and gorgeous, isn't helpful either."
2,Don't Use ANY LSAT book That Comes With A DVD!!!,"As a professional LSAT tutor/blogger in NYC, I can tell you that it is CRUCIAL that you practice only with real practice exams published by LSAC. The LSAT is not a computerized exam. It has never been one.When LSAT prep companies start publishing books with DVDs in them, you know that they're just trying to take your money. Steer clear of this book and go with LSAC's ""Next 10 Actual Official LSAT Preptests."""
1,CRACKING the LSAT 2009 EDITION,"I am very disappointed in this book because when I tried to register my new book with Princeton Review Materials it gives me a message that the date to register has expired. Even though I just recently purchased this book. I do not believe the date should expire especially since it is a new book.Cracking the LSAT, 2009 Edition (Graduate School Test Preparation)"
5,Best I've seen so far,"Just bought this one and have spent a few hours in the games section. If I had read this prior to taking my LSAT earlier this month, I would not have needed to cancel my score and reschedule to take it again in September. Very useful and to the point explanation of: A) what the games actually are (puzzles of spatial relationships) B) A method for quickly determining a good model diagram. C) A specific explanation of the basic formal logic that will be the most helpful in saving time and choosing correct answers. Very impressed so far."
1,LSAT,this was a gift. therefore I have no idea about this product. i have not heard from the present owner.
2,Depends on what you want...,"If you are looking for a rigorous step in abstract algebra this is probably not the book you want. If you are taking a fairly elementary one semester undergrad course and will never see this subject again, it is great. The proofs are weak (compare to Hungerford - the intro NOT the grad text - or Dummit and Foote - which, admittedly is more advanced, but not that much). This subject (like topology and real analysis) tends to depend on where you are and what you want."
4,fun math,"After high school algebra and geometry, most of the math we learn doesn't apply much to the every day world. So, when a college math book takes the time to show examples of real world applications, I appreciate it. It helps to ground the material. This is not the rigorous, concise, law-theorem-corollary-lemma-and-repeat kind of book one gets used to, but it was fun to read. I'd recommend reading this along with a traditional style algebra textbook."
4,Jack Dangers finally gets his jazz album.,"After years of pioneering dance, dub, big beat, jungle, alternative hip hop, and tape music, Jack Dangers' Meat Beat Manifesto project evolves to where it was always headed, an improvisational jazz quartet. Part of 'The Blue Series' on Thirsty Ear Recordings, an imprint fusing electronics with jazz, they could have not asked for a better contributor. MBMs albums have differed vastly over the past 20 years, and this may be one of their most unexpected yet. Using well known jazz musicians, Dangers layers beats, bass clarinet and flute, and thundering dub basslines over improvised noodling that changes with the flow of each track, sometimes employing his trademark vocal sample archives. Overall, a welcome experience, now we just need him to pick up the microphone again, and school all newcomers."
4,Great,"As always, Jack totally reinvents himself with each release and makes an album that only he can make. With a mixture jazz and electro sensabilties, ""At The Center"" may be a suprise to his fans used to the techno industrial sounds of the past 16 years, but in the end, it rewards greatly. Surely not one to miss if you think Jack as much of a musical genius as the rest of us do. However, As Subliminal Sandwich notes, I suggest you ""play twice before listening.""My only complaint is that, once again, Jack's vocals are absent. Please bring your singing back, Jack!Otherwise, this is a treat for your ears."
2,Little Book,"This book is worth the minimal amount of money they are charging for it, but keep in mind it's a little book (maybe 4x6) this is pretty small for a three or four year old to hang on to and do projects in in the car."
3,Blending utility and well... yeah,"The Junkyard Dog II is ALMOST a great knife. It's ALMOST light enough for daily carry that you forget it's there. It's ALMOST short enough for civilian use without attracting undue attention. It's ALMOST stylish enough that you feel proud of it. It's ALMOST handy enough to be your go to knife for any situation...It fits in the hand well (at least my hand)well. It's blade shape takes some getting used to, and the serrations are just about the only understated thing on the whole knife (unfortunately, it could really benifit from some teeth). What's the deal with no thumb-stud, Kershaw? Really? You're going to limit me to a flipper? No matter how much I like it on my Gerber's or Ken Onion blades, thumb-studs are at this point ubiquitous in the industry.For the price point, you're definitely getting your money's worth. The JYD will cut, saw, and slice with the best in it's group. But if you're willing to step up just a touch, you'd probably be much more satisfied."
3,Now Foods Magnesium and Potassium Aspartate,"The package arrived with a powdery feel to the bottles. Inside the first bottle was a damaged pill caught in the top when being filled, evidently, as there were particles of the pill in the contents. I assume it was just one pill but all the pills were powdery from the contents of that one. Useable, but not the way I would have liked them to be. I have not opened the other 3 bottles."
1,More mediocrities,"BILL HALEY AND THE COMETS is another example of re-recorded, retreaded, regurgitated remakes. Other than that-- great stuff.Look for this seminal rock & roll band's mid-Fifties DECCA sides, also Haley's earlier (and rare) SADDLEMEN records."
5,The newest version was published in 2007.,"Dr. Gilmour is always updating and expanding the scope of devices covered in this book. Once he has enough updated material, he publishes a new revision. The newer versions seem to be even harder to obtain. From what I can tell, with the number of true microwave tube design engineers and their associated manufacturing base constantly skrinking, his goal is to have this book serve as a educational tool to keep the knowledge base from being lost. Microwave tubes, especially the higher frequency and higher power ones, are not going obsolete any time soon.It is an excellent resource. I would recommend any version of this book to anyone. Where I work, we drop a copy of this book in front of new personnel."
1,Sucks!,"The saw blade broke the first time I used it, just snapped in half on a small branch? It is pretty, but very brittle, glad I didn't get hurt using it. I bought a real one at the store after that, and have had no problems, wouldn't recommend the Toro Saw to anyone...they should stick to mowers."
5,An enjoyable read - make sure you get the whole series!,"This is the third in a five part series that really manages to blend history and full-blown fiction. Jacq's Egypt comes alive and jumps off the page, stealing you away to a world where magic might just be real and all those dry history stores come to life. I was really surprised at who ""the good guys"" and ""the bad guys"" turned out to be, and found myself really feeling for the characters in the pages. I highly recommend reading the series in order - you might just catch yourself rereading it, like I did ... wow, I just realized how cheezy that all sounds, but they really are great books."
5,Ramses: The Battle of Kadesh (Vol 3),"A great read, but I recommend reading the first 2 volumes before you read Kadesh."
5,Brilliant,"While clearly not my favourite in the series ,Battle of Kadesh begins to tie together all the plots from the previous books....A brilliant novel in itsown right"
5,Essential component for my library.,I've cited this work in almost every paper I've written on gender and transgender topics; I finally just had to buy my own copy rather than constantly checking it out from the library and paying so much in late fees!
4,Bright spots galore in this story collection,"If I were the author of The Road To Wellville, I don't think I'd print that on my books. I think I'd just coast on having a wonderful name like ""Coraghessan"" to throw around. In any case, 56-0 was sort of heartbreaking, and Top of the Food Chain barreled down a road I'd always wondered about, and Big Game I really liked, for being about Hemingway a little, and Filthy With Things scared the living daylights out of me, reminding me more than a little of the Stephen King story Quitters, Inc."
4,One of the best products iave used but with a glitch,ive used the pro before and i just had to have oneits a great took for electrical diagnosisand u can ground and power electrical loads with a push of a buttonits a awesomethe only defect mine came with is that its not making a good contact when the tip is screw into the proi had to put a spacer in order for it to work.other than that its great..but i would have same up some more to get the 3 sonce it also shows u voltage
5,delta hurricane,Larry's Vocal's and Guitar Playing are both strong and soulfull.This c.d. has some of his best music played loud and proud and has an excellent version of Soulshine.It's even better if you can see Him perform live.
3,Not what I was hoping for,"Solid overall musically, but I am a big Phish fan and I was hoping for something reflective of their jazzier work. The tempo and pace of the songs are reminiscent of Phish but Claypool's bass is too overpowering on most songs. Trey's smooth guitar that made Phish so great gets lost. If you're a Primus fan you'll probably like this a lot but if you bought it because you're a Phish fan you'll be disappointed."
3,So promising....,"This album is pretty much what I would expect from a violent, bloody, three way collision of Phish, Primus and The Police. Trey's guitar work seems to have gotten the worst of it. In terms of improvisational music, he barely PLAYS and what he does play is extremely ""Rock'n'roll"". Apart from that obnoxious loop sampler, his guitar doesn't even sound like him. I think if you enjoyed the last couple of Phish albums- The Story of the Ghost and Farmhouse, there's a possibility that you will like this album. I would say its most redeeming quality is Les Claypool's contributions: both playing and singing. Even so, its a disappointment. Although it has smatterings of many different styles, it doesn't really do anything well. Its not improvisational, the lyrics aren't that clever, its not good catchy rock, its not very heavy, its not very funky. The Grand Pecking Order is listenable, but just plain uninteresting."
2,"good, but ehh...","Okay, I love Les Claypool, and I've been a pretty big Phish phan, so when I heard about Oysterhead, I was thrilled. They played a few shows, and I heard those and loved them. Then the album came out and I got it right away. I started listening to it, and i waited. And I waited. I was waiting for it to live up to my expectations, but it never got there. It sounds great, and the playing is top notch, but the songs are so filtered that they never really grab you. It's almost like background music...Buy it if you know you'll like it, but then this review is pointless anyway. I guess what I'm trying to say is borrow it, listen to it, then decide. I haven't listened to it since the day I got it."
3,"Not Phish, but not bad","if your expecting some groovin jams from Trey and Les, this might not be what you have in mind. The very studio feel to the album is not something i particularly love but the album comes together well. My personal favorites are ""Oz is Ever Floating"", ""Shadow of a man"", and the albums name sake ""The Grand Pecking Order"". All in all three insanely talented musicians come together to make an album, so you cant go wrong. You may love it, hate it, or be partial but i suggest checking it out."
4,THIS IS A GREAT RELEASE!!,"Ok.....I know that the name Trey Anastasio conjures up images of twirling tie-dyed hippies moving to the grooves of his band Phish. THIS IS NOT PHISH! Trey's a great guitarist. Les Claypool is a great bassist (I'm not real big on his vocal style....a little silly....too ""Primus"")and Stewart Copeland (the Police) is one of THE best drummers around. This is a real good, groovin release that will, guaranteed, get yer booty movin! ENJOY!!"
5,The Future of Music,"This record is an indication of things to come in the world of music. A highly produced record, that blends a funkier sound with the sounds we would expext from Trey, Les and Stew. The musicianship is excellent, as one would expect from these three, and the tones they respectively produce are unique and fresh. Maybe the best rhythm section to record since the tragic death of Keith Moon. The songwriting is wonderfully creative and the jams truly incredible. Anyone with an interest in where contemporary music is headed must own this record.When all else has been done and saidAlong comes Mr. Oysterhead."
2,Great Players but a bit uninspired,"Les Claypool with Stuart Copeland!!! You would think that this was a dream come true...and it easily could have been. The talent is there but this is a side project and not truly a band. If it were an instrumental album it would have been at LEAST a FOUR but the vocals just seem out of place and to put it bluntly a bit annoying at times. The song ""Radon Balloon"" stands out as a great work though, and if they would have gone for instrumental solos over it they would have a masterpiece."
2,Didn't enjoy it....,"I was looking forward to hear something by Trey again... and i don't know I thought this was going to be a little more like Phish... and it really has a Primus sound.... which personally i'm just not into... i'm glad someone is enjoying it.... you folks have a great time with it... i listened to the cd two times.... and only one song on there in my opinion, that was worth listening to.... and i have no wish to ever listen to the cd again."
2,Disappointment,"When I bought this CD I had high hopes of hearing some great musicians come together to do something different and unique...I was let down. They don't really come together at all. They each have three distinct talented sounds in their respective and former bands. Unfortunately, it just doesn't really blend into a new sound. Each of their styles sort of hang in the air and don't really compliment each other. I give them two stars for the attempt at humor."
2,What a let down.,"After seeing these guys perform on Reverb I was very interested to hear the rest of their new CD. Especially after listening to Stewart Copeland's playing on ""pseudo suicide"" - the song they featured on that show. But now that I've listened to the rest of what they did, I get the impression that they put this album together solely for finacial reasons and not because of any artistic inspiration. Don't get me wrong-I'm still huge fans of these guys as individual musicians, but I found this album to be a collection of very formulaic and unoriginal music. In short, I've heard music like this before - from high school students. Maybe thats who they're writing this stuff for, but I probably will not bother to listen to it very often as it doesn't really inspire me as a musician. I really expected more."
1,Dear Lord WHY???,"Ouch. Claypool, Trey, and Copeland are very accomplished musicians, but this album isn't particularly good. The technical skill is there (Claypool especially, he really steals the spotlight in my opinion), but the songs have little or no hook at all. I did like Birthday Boys, though, and that sounded more like a Phish song than anything else. Better songwriting would save this album. Some folks are drawing parallels between Frank Zappa's lyrics and those on this album. As a Zappa fan, I'm offended by that. Zappa was incredibly literate and it showed in his conceptual continuity - these guys sound like they wrote these in high school. Frank was dirty, lewd, and childish at times, but he never mired in the painfully contrived and/or forced-sounding lyrics found in ""Weild the Spade"" and ""Mr. Oysterhead"" I'm glad I didn't pay money for this, and I suggest that you borrow it first for a listen as I did."
1,Are You People Insane?,"This is absolutely one of the worst records to come out in years. It's an embarrassment to the careers of Stewart Copeland and Trey Anastasio (although Copeland has had an equally embarrassing experience with The Doors, and now is suing them). The question begs the both of them: What were they thinking?Les Claypool is a very average bass player with horribly bad vocals and infantile songs.The ONLY redeeming factor of this record is that, if taken and accepted by the listener as ""an experiment"" in music, then there are some cool grooves sporadically. These are completely overshadowed by the fact that Claypool has taken too much acid and Stewart and Trey allowed it to happen.Stewart - please try for another Police re-union.Trey - go home to Phish.Les - drive a bread truck or something."
4,Great Album,"If you like Trey Anastasio, Les Claypool, and Stewart Copeland; you can't go wrong buying this album!"
2,Beware of Emasculation !,"While this is an excellent book on the Benedictine Way, this is only one part of the original version of Cardinal Hume's book, ""Searching for God"". If you can look very carefully and get a copy of the original (old new edition),Searching for God,Searching for Godas published by Hodder, you will get more of his excellent teaching.It is a great pity, also that this book is published either with the original title or with the new title ""The Intentional Life - The Making of a Spiritual Vocation"", both of which are misleading in that they are stripped down versions of the original as published by Cardinal Hume. The new publishers have done us all a great disservice."
4,"Insightful, resonant and useful read","This is a great book for those seeking insights into their personal vocations. Hume addresses a Benedictine novice in this book but many of the lessons that he speaks of can be applied to other walks in life, including married life and the single life. Clearly this is most relevant to a R.C. audience but I think others can read and relate to most of it without too much difficulty. His style is personable and conversational -- uncommon for authors of his caliber."
5,Not Hardbound,"I can't add more to the praise for this book than others have done. It's a shame it is out of print and so hard to find.One correction to Amazon's description: This is a PAPERBACK book. I was disappointed in receving my used copy which I purchased through Amazon Marketplace. I was about to request a refund from my seller until I noticed it was Amazon, not my seller, who made the error. Please don't be disappointed if you order this used and receive a paperback copy."
5,Super low-cost ear-buds,"I've been through at least 8 sets of earphones or ear-buds for several MP3 or CD players. Since I wear them at work everyday and other times I tend to be pretty hard on them. With such a low price on these compared to a number of others, I was a little apprehensive about the quality, but not only can I hear music more clearly than the manufacturer's supplied ear-buds for my current MP3 player, these are very comfortable, soft and help reduce ambient noise. They may not satisfy everyone, but they have turned out to be the best I've ever had. I'm glad I bought 2 sets at the low price."
3,Acceptale,"Comes with two sets of ear buds, but about the same size. Both too large for my ears. Sound quality is about average. Wires have remained kinked from packaging and have never straightened out. Would not purchase again."
2,"Pretty low quality sound, and ""no"" it's not just the fit.","I know that many people have rated this highly, but I just tried a pair for my brother. I have many types of ear buds, including Shure (E2c), Sony (EX51LP), Apple basic ones, Koss (KEB24), JVC gummy's, etc. These sound the worst. It is not simply a matter of fit. They have very poor bass response and mushy middle. These have the poorest sound of any of the models I have tried. Ironically, the cheap Koss model above has among the best sound, IF you get the rubber parts fitting your ears just right. Wish these were better since I've paid 20 bucks for them, and won't likely return them, but they are not very good. They are also among the least comfortable ones I've tried."
5,Well worth the effort,"This volume of the new real book is another must-have. It combines a good mix of latin, fusion & some unexpected gems of standards. The calligraphy is excellent and the forms of the tunes are always designed to use the least number of pages per tune - unlike ""manufatured"" sheet music!I used this volume for teaching purposes in university and it proved to be a ""benchmark"" for students wanting to create their own charts in an intelligible style. Some of the tunes are quite obscure, but with the comprehensive charting and extra instrumentation, re-creating the tunes with authenticity can be easily achieved - if that's your ""bag"".Only minus is the spiral binding - get your front & rear covers stuck on ""clothed card"" to avoid losing the front & rear covers - otherwise they tend to tear off."
3,It has a really weird flaw,"The quality of this product is excellent. The sound from it is really good too....EXCEPT when I play WITHOUT the stem on the lower register (B flat in first position partial) Like if I take out the stem, I play B flat on top of the staff solid, F on the fourth line solid, then low B flat comes out really unstable and airy as if there is a leak in the horn. It's really weird. I'm playing on a Conn 88H closed wrap although I tried on my friend's 88H open wrap and the same issue occurred. I still say it's recommendable although the Jo-Ral might be a better option for this kind of mute."
2,eats batteries,"As i posted in the title it will dry a battery set even when it's turned off in less than a couple of days, image quality is bad, in low light don't even think of using it.i got it as a toy for my 8 yr old anyway..."
5,"Very ambitious,","very intelligent, very enjoyable. No lapses of logic, no lose ends the author fails to cope with, and it all works out in the end! Now how often does *that* happen? :-)An altogether satisfying experience."
5,Marvelous,"Door Number Three was very good. However, with THE GIFT, O'Leary rendered a delicately balanced, intricate masterpiece. In this gorgeous, tightly-woven tale, O'Leary evokes the poetic magic of Gene Wolfe, who is, in my opinion the greatest writer in the science fiction field. Those incapable of comprehending anything more subtle than THE WHEEL OF TIME, best keep away."
4,surprisingly good read aloud for kids,"After Door Number Three, this was quite a change. I enjoyed it very much as an adult reader; I'm not entirely sure that after one read I realy got the author's point, but the writing was enthralling, so I didn't care (sort of like reading Pynchon). The great thing, though, was that it makes a great read aloud book. Not only did my 9 year old beg me to keep reading, but his friends sat on the porch, ignoring the pool, listening to us read, even though they came in at the middle of the story.I can't wait for the next O'Leary installment."
3,Beautifully plotted but not quite there.,"I found ""The Gift"" to be frustrating because it came so close to being magnificent. The use of stories, the slow unfolding of both present and past, the characters and situations were wonderful. Ultimately, though, I think it suffered from looking at women only from the outside -- like Tim, who says at the end, ""I don't really understand women,"" the book looks at women (and female nonhumans) as Other and can't get inside them."
2,What the.....?,I've read countless numbers of Sci-Fi and fantasy tales and The Gift definately ranks as one of the lowest to me. The storyline had such great potential but the author chose not to use it. The plot jumps around as if the author wrote a chapter and stopped for a month then returning without looking back at what he previously wrote. The narrative was also somewhat childish. I looked forward to this book after reading the reviews. What a let down it proved to be! Mr. O'Leary please use better focus next time!!Adult reader Near Chicago.
5,Amazed...,"This was my first experience reading one of O'Leary's books and I was drawn in and captivated from the first page. The setting, the language, the subtle use of fantasy tropes to tell a unique story, I devoured every page and have re-read it twice to pick up all the details as I traveled with Tim, Simon, and the loathsome Usher.At under 300 pages O'Leary packs an incredible amount of content, but there is an artful precision to every part as the stories fit with and complement each other in an elaborate puzzle greater than the sum of its pieces. Very welcome in this age of overblown multi-volume epics."
1,...what?,"After finishing <i>The Gift</i>, I was inspired to undertake a seldom-done task: trying to think of any book worse - or even equally bad - as this one.While the novel had potential and even some good aspects - I loved the intermitten stories - it failed to make use of either. The characters were cliché, the dialogue weak at best, the plot so sporatic and wraught with the bizarre that it really made no sense. And, frankly, it was boring.It ended on a lecture that brought back memories of the anti-climactic Socialist diatribe that ended Sinclair's <i>The Jungle.</i> I think it might have been trying to send a message, but what is beyond me. As another reviewer noted, I am at a complete loss as to the point of this book.I was barely able to finish <i>The Gift,</i> and by the time I had, I wished I'd never started it."
4,Lady Kung Fu,Good MovieSamo is greatLittle Unicorn is FantastictCarter Wong is bearableQuality of dvd was most excellent
2,Scratched,IT WAS SCRATCHED UPON ARRIVAL . The disc was not sitting on the center peg. It was broken.I did the best i could to view it.
2,"Very outdated, very basic","This book was published in 1945. It is 9""x6"". There are 132 pages, all B&W; photos, B&W; silhouettes of the planes in question. There are many errors in the text & captions. Some line drawings and cut aways are included in the text. The author gives an overview of the principles of flight, engines, and airframe designs.For the time, it would have been a good intro to WW2 aircraft, although only British, US, German and Italian designs are included. One of the things I did like were the comparisons of one plane to another. However, the author skips around a lot from fighter to bomber back to figher, etc.I spent $10 on the book back in 1993 and was disappointed."
1,Specs,"It would be very helpful if there were more specs on the web site. I bought this game because I love tetris, however I was unaware that it would not work on Windows 2000. Now I don't know if it is any good or not."
3,Teddy Bears picnic cookbook,"Book is cute but I was disappointed to see pages missing from the book. Included several ""recipes"" my children could help with."
5,Only In My Dreams,"OMG This book was amazing. Sutton and Greyson so much love you could feel there love reading this story. Sierra was so cute. We now need Chevy and Kirkland's story. I can't say enough about this book. Ms. White you have a new fan, keep the books coming."
4,Great read,I really enjoyed reading this story. I like the small town feel and the family atmoshpere that was shown through out the book. The characters were real and it was easy to identify with both Greyson and Sutton. They were two who alhtough they knew they belonged together allowed family obligations and other issues to get in the way. I was glad they found their way back to each other. I am looking forward to reading more with Chevy and Maddie.
4,rollin' with number one,been looking for this for a long time and the wait is over.definitely worth the wait.
5,"Even better than the first book- ""A+""","This is even better than the first book in this series, a great read, it is a rich and exciting epic whose true force lies in the interesting development of its characters, richly detailed setting, and fast paced plot.The main character is likable, very understandable and interesting.This is one of the best series of books done by the Forgotten Realms/Wizards of the Coast, the story is lively and entertaining, the characters are colorful and interesting, and the plot is energetic and spellbinding!OVERALL SCORE: (A+)READABILITY: (A), PLOT: (A), CHARATERS: (A), DIALOGUE: (A-), SETTING: (A+), ACTION/COMBAT: (A-), MONSTERS/ANTAGONISTS: (A-), ROMANCE: (B+), SEX: (n/a), AGE LEVEL: (PG13)*****"
3,Like most others,"This product performs like most brass impact sprinklers. The swing arm is all brass, unlike some others that are cast bronze, so this product should last many years. It does require substantial pressure to operate. I purchased this particular product because the company's website said, ""Products proudly made in the USA."" However, when I received the package, ""Made in Taiwan"" was printed on it. This was very disappointing to me, because I went with Champion solely because the website led me to believe it was made in the US. After further research, as far as I can tell, only one company still manufactures brass impact sprinklers in the US: Weather Tec. Others, such as Rain Bird, Nelson, Buckner, Gilmour, Dramm, Orbit, Aqua Burst, and Champion all source from abroad. If the country of origin is important to you, you may wish to consider this information."
2,Not up to par with prior entries in the series,"I've admired Haney's Lieutenant Bak stories, but have to admit that this one just doesn't live up to her best. Bak strikes out on an interminable trek in the desert to find the son of big-wig. By the time the mystery is solved, you feel like you've spent WAY too much time in the desert yourself. The solution is not particularly satisfying.I'm hoping that when Bak moves north for his new assignment, the series will regain its spirit."
2,a path of shadows,"I'm glad a previous reviewer enjoyed this book and the previous one, but I did not. I too am a great fan of this series, but the last two books seemed flat to me--not very engaging. I certainly will continue to read Haney's books about Lieutenant Bak because when they are good(which they usually are) they are very very good."
2,Not so good,"I enjoy archeological and anthropological mysteries, so when I found this series, I thought it would be right up my alley.In some ways, it is. However, Doherty's Egyptian books are much better, mainly because they give us the setting and environment of the stories without overkill. I get really tired of all the detail in Ms. Haney's novels, and it's always the same.Additionally, although I know the old world really didn't have a lot of names, Ms. Haney uses the same name over and over again, but for different characters. This tends to be quite confusing at times. Surely there were enough ancient Egyptian names that it isn't necessary to call a soldier one name in one book, and a priest by the same name in another."
2,Another not very exciting Lt. Bak story...,"I keep trying but cannot get interested in the stories by this author. They seem to drag out with her style of ""he said/she said"" writing with nothing exciting, except perhaps one part in this book. The story begins as the famous Lt. Bak is asked by his commander Thuty to investigate the disappearance of an explorer named Minnakht. His guide, Senna tells Bak of the disappearance and attraction to turquoise mines near the sea. The land is hostile and murder and death come as Lt. Bak questions each man over and over. The ending was not exciting or unexpected. Lt. Bak's constant referrals to the donkeys (we know how he is sympathetic to animals, this big strong medjay!! I had to make myself sit and finish it."
4,Herman Olivera!!! Need I say more?!?!?!!!!,"This album is great for those who are looking for depth and intelligence when listening to salsa, both lyrically and musically! Herman Olivera (singer) is amazing!!! A true Sonero! I HIGHLY recommend this album."
5,Babyland does it again!,"Yet another brilliant release for Babyland. If this is any indication of how good their next full length album will be then I can hardly wait for it to come out. The highlights of this EP are definitely Gehry and Nowadays. If you're a fan of any of Babyland's previous releases, you will definitely like this one. I also think that with tracks like Gehry, this EP has the potential to pull in a whole new range of fans."
4,Babyland has matured,"I was lucky enough to see Babyland in a nasty dive bar last night(no cover charge!) I bought ""Who's Sorry Now"" about 6 years ago and didn't think much of it at the time. I pulled it out earlier this week when I heard they were coming to town and enjoyed it more, but they've really progressed since then. The surprising standout of their live show was ""Gehry""- a simple pop song. Sure they impressed everyone by screaming and setting fires and shooting sparks into our faces, but ""Gehry"" got everyone dancing like it was 1988. If you miss good, intelligent new wave, pick this up. There's still plenty of ranting, but ""Gehry"" may make you want to put away your Doc Martins and pull out your skinny ties."
4,Good background reading - Lots of answers,"This book sets out to answer the questions that transsexuals and their entourage often pose. The answers are based on fact, but occasionaly biased to the authors opinions. I found it an interesting book. It opens even more questions than it answers, but that's life. Would I give it away when coming out - No, but I'd have a copy to lend it out!!!There are things that I couldn't/shall not be able to explain, reading this book has helped me to understand myself better, and better expalin my situation. It will no doubt be a useful arm in my collection."
5,He is the Sage!,More thought provoking words from the Nationally syndicated talk show host out of Los Angeles. I truly believe that he is a man of honest good sense. He and Dennis Prager (a friend and fellow writer of Mr. Elder's) have totally changed my view of politics and ethics. Give this book to your least favorite politician!! Watch out Maxine Waters! I'm sending you one.
5,Phenomal Book,"Anyone who enjoys reading will enjoy this book. It it so refreshing, so persuasive, so thought-provoking, and so insightful, that it is simply a joy to read. Showdown is a real mind-opener and challenges the status quo in a way that no other book truly does. Elder destroys commonly held misconceptions, originally argues points many are afraid to make, and demonstrates the frightening dominance the left has over the media and education. You have to read this book."
2,Shows the true side of government as well as himself!,I find Larry's thoughts are honest whether you like them or not. I have a problem with his thoughts on Medicare and Social Security. I am thirty-eight and have epilepsy. I'm unable to work or drive due to the harm I could do to myself or others. Perhaps Mr. Elder will give me a job. I'll take it! Do you think he will send his limo to pick me up for and take me home from work?
1,"An Incredible Distortion of ""Facts""","I""m a conservative. I generally believe in less government being in the best interest of the general good. This book, however, slams government in the most unprofessional manner I have ever seen. I read about half of it and it made me sick. It appears that Elder's writing style follows his radio show...or perhaps he is attempting to follow in the steps of fellow radio personality Howard Stern....everything appears to be written for ""shock value"" ...never have I seen such an intentional and incredible distortion of ""facts."" I have seen Mr. Elder speak on many occasions and he is quite an accomplished speaker who seems knowledgeable...I even acknowledge that I liked listening to him and that he was thought-provoking. Unfortunately, the only thought provoked by this book is [bad]."
2,bad translation,"I have the original Pomiane cookbook - in french. Unfortunately this translation does not do it justice. For example confusing the"" pte"" ( as in pte a Choux ) meaning dough and pate - With the accent on ""E"" meaning - well pate ( as in liver pate).Also missing are his funny ""asides"""
3,Suburban,"I got this for the back of our new SUV. It fits a little rough and after about a month of having it it still doesn't fi around the seat lift levers to fold the third row seats down. However, it does do a really good job protecting the carpet."
3,Interesting and attractive watch but very big,"This is an attractive and interesting watch, but it's just too large for a woman. I think it's considered ""unisex,"" but it only makes sense on a man's wrist."
4,Great Band from the 70s and 80's,This is a sensational hit parade of Dragon classics.I had the pleasure of seeing them live and this CD reminds me of how great these guys were.Rain is an awesome track and worth the CD price alone but the CD is full of some great pop songs.
3,Underrated and Unappreciated,"...at least on this side of the Pacific Ocean. Like most Americans whohave even heard of Dragon, I was only familiar with the song, ""Rain.""It was the one song that prompted me to purchase this album CD. Due toa variety of circumstances both within and beyond their control, the bandDragon never made it big in the U.S., but from what I understand they havequite a fan base in Australia and their native New Zealand - andjustifiably so. I was pleasantly surprised by a few of the tracks on thisCD, such as ""Younger Years"" and ""Celebration."" I didn't think anyonecould do Kool and the Gang justice, but I must admit that Dragon's versionis pretty darn good. But ""Rain"" is a great song - a signature hit thatwill be around and recognized 50 years from now. For the true Dragon fan,my best advice is to buy this compilation before it - and any other bythe band - is gone from production forever."
4,deep dish r&b,"Before disco was co-opted by the white shirts and hacks out to make a quick buck, REAL dance music was being made like this. Forget BPM's and remixes, MFSB did it all real time. Complex arrangements, swirling strings, punchy horns, vibes, and a KILLER rhythm section propelled the beat AND the melody. Gamble & Huff and their team of writers, arrangers, and singers made it all seem so simple. The swing revival going on now should also include the music of MFSB, which not only swings hard, but teases, cajoles, soothes, and inspires. Just try NOT dancing to this!!!!"
5,Groovilicious!,"MFSB is a group that uses real instruemts and real vocals to come up with these brilliant tracks. No fancy overproduction, no sampling (although their work is often sampled); just a collection of pure soul from the old school. A worthy purchase for any music lover."
4,Great Courtroom Drama,"If you've ever read David Ellis before you know he is an excellent writer. In Jury of One he tells a fantastic story about Shelly Trotter, a lawyer, who defends a young man, she knows from helping him out previously, from a murder charge. The story of this young man becomes increasingly more complicated and interesting as the plot builds. During the trial many new things are discovered. Although throughout the book I knew there was something significant going on, I really didn't guess what it was and was quite surprised when the last critical piece of information was revealed. It reads quickly and you will never lose your attention and interest from the beginning to end. I also loved that he brought in a couple of characters from past books. If you like legal thrillers, you'll love this!"
2,"Slow moving, ponderous and boring","It must be me! I've tried to read three of Ellis's novels and found all of them to be wholly unsatisfactory. The story moves excruciatingly slowly, the dialogue is superficial and the plot is very one-dimensional. I'm an avid reader and enjoy a wide variety of genres including legal thrillers but I'm afraid I've got to give up on Mr. Ellis. Congratulations to those that find him a five star writer, wish I did as I'm always searching for new authors."
1,What a disappointment!,"This is the third David Ellis book and, in my opinion, it is far more uneven than the first two. A child's advocate is drawn into a criminal case when a student she had previously represented in a misdemeanor case is accused of killing a police officer. The book twists and turns but in ways that are totally absurd. Does she find out the identity of the child she gave aware after becoming pregnant as a teenager? Well, you think so but then she's wrong. Does one of the facts that she and a private investigator reenact when they visit the crime scene turn out to be a critical clue? Well, it seems that they forget what they discussed in an alley. Do the references and inclusion of characters and events from the first book add anything to this story? In my opinion, no. I think he is a very capable writer but none of his three books has lived up to his abilities. If he ever puts everything together, he could rise to the top of the heap."
3,Don't Judge Others Bilaterly.,"In this dead part of summer, August and first part of September, as students wrap up leisure to start studying books again, several dead bodies surface at the beach. Near the boardwalk in Northeast, fun in the sun and, later, behind closed doors where my detractors belong are noted for a peaceful, quiet town. That was before Mark, a pedifile who's never measured up to grown women, uses and abuses Cindy at random as she looked at the star-filled sky. She's his first victim.Every night he'd wander the neighborhood looking for prey. Before long, there were other victims of this serial killer. But, he would always remember Cindy as it all happened so easily from the back the way he took his pleasure. He'd learned how to work it that way so as to not get caught. If a girl told, she could not prove anything."
5,japanese literature,I have thoroughly enjoyed this collection of poems and shorts. The imaginative talent during this period effects the soul of all periods with but a few words. It is hard to top the gut reaction to the writing. No one knows unrequited love better. It is amazing and the book is more than wonderful.
3,It is an Anthology.,"It is a collection of writings that were translated by other Authors. I wish it had more pages, but alas I no nothing about the history of Japanese literature and do not know how much has been preserved. At a Tokyo Museaum, there was a display of the Bombing/Burning of Tokyo during WWII. I shutter to think of what has been lost.Quality of the book was bad. Incredibly thin pages. Very coarse."
1,Not worth your time,"The style of his writing was positively annoying, but I could get past that. There seemed to be nothing substantial for the first... half(?) of the book. Thereafter, however, the annoying style was eclipsed by illogical arguments. You'll have to read it yourself if you want actual details of what I'm talking about, but the author misrepresented persons he quoted, he committed strawman and hasty generalization fallacies, he drove a hard line between worship and life (when our lives are supposed to be worship), he drew false conclusions based on unsupported premises, and in all honesty, I despised reading the book. Here's the sad thing: I agree with his major point, the modern church is sacrificing truth for entertainment. I could not, however, disagree more with the way he exposited that point."
2,Hey Kool-Aid !!!!!,"What ever you do, don't drink Gary Gilley's Kool-aid! People are never the same afterwards. The underlying theme is that some churches worship the wrong way. Obviously, God appeared to him and told him this. It could not be the fact that he is a bitter man from a failing church. Maybe some churches have just evolved to meet the needs of people in the 21st Century. Now that Christians are no longer executed for their beliefs, we are allowed some latitude without the threat of stoning. Perhaps some churches are losing their message. Who is Mr. Gilley to judge what is the ""wrong message""? I think I know who that decision is ultimately up to. If there is a problem, HE will take care of it. Until then Mr. Gilley, worry about yourself."
1,Go to your own market,"Why does this author always tear down others beliefs? This author (pastor) should concentrate more on his ""fold"" and stop trying so hard to make other Christians feel they are not as worthy as he is. Does he think he is God? Go back to your own teachings to your ""group"", Pastor."
4,very good,"is an excellent item for cold weather, you feel your fingers wrap and comfortable.I recommend it for any time"
4,One of those movie themes you'll remember for years.,"So you saw the movie and you are thinking about getting the soundtrack...I had the opposite experience of the previous reviewer. This is weird cause I'm a musician too. And a clasically trained one.I go to the movies at least once per week and it seldon happens to me that while (or just after) watching the movie, I tell myself ""I have to get this soundtrack"". Well, it happened to me with Eastwood's movie. While watching it, I kept telling myself ""remember to get this CD"". Imagine my surprise when I saw that Eastwood had composed the main theme.If you are thinking about getting this CD...well...just do it. It's one of those nice simple (minimalistic, yes) tunes you'll be proud of having in your collection."
2,Mostly it just doesn't work,"While I was watching the film, there were some spots that I thought the music went pretty well with what was on screen. However, most of the time I was wondering what the heck the composer was thinking. Near the end the score even turns into something you'd hear in a horror film rather than a drama. The score is just too all over the place. The main theme is also repeated way too much with basically no variation at all. I didn't know Eastwood scored it until I came hear to see who scored it. I did like the film a lot. I just think Eastwood should stick to directing."
3,Page Flipping,"Its a great game and the guide is alright if you like page flipping. The maps were pretty good but the guide wasn't written in the order that you play the game. There is a hub type area called Windy that you have to keep returning to to further your progress in the game. In the Prima guide, you have to keep returning to the first chapter (Windy) to figure out what to do and then page ahead in the book and find where you go from there. The Brady Games book flows a lot better and they have a great multiplayer section!"
5,into the west movie and soundtrack,this is the greatest movie ever made.It is really sad but also very beautiful. And i believe that this movie is about true facts not just made up.
2,Dependent on a perfect world,"I am a renovation contractor. I have used a certain pocket door hardware set (that starts with ""J""). Not being available, I purchased this set. It works okay and is similar to the other brand with one critical exception: the latching hardware that attaches to the top of the door allowing for removal is low grade plastic as opposed to metal.I had this plastic latch freeze in place so that I couldn't get the door out for further tweaking. The plastic latching arm would bend and distort but not release from the attachment post of the roller bearing. We tried everything...ended up having to cut it out with a sawzall(!) and obtain a replacement part. I do not believe this situation would have occurred with the metal latch of the competition's product, making it superior IMO."
1,Thing doesn't work,This thing never registered anything close to an accurate temperature. I would never buy one again.
4,"The antidote to all those ""beauty of nature"" tomes","By avoiding the empty rapture nature writing seems prone to, Grice has ironically produced a book that gives us a greater respect for the incredible constructs of the animal kingdom. Fantastic."
5,Wonderful,"His graceful prose makes the everyday lives of these critters into fascinating stories. Highly recommended, except to those with no intellectual curiousity."
5,"Danger is everywhere, especially the toilet!","What an INCREDIBLE book! Bought it after reading about it here at Amazon and I did'nt regret it. The essays are well written, detailed enough to intrigue those with advanced knowledge of biology, yet simple enough to ensnare(no pun intended!!) the interested layman.Grice does all his subjects justice, showing the proper amount of enthusiasm and healthy fear, even for the pig-This ain't Charlotte's Web, baby!!My only wish is that this book would get as much publicity as a Clancy or Grisham novel, cause I was never afraid to go into my basement after reading those two....now, I'm constantly on the lookout for all creatures, great and small, who might be lurking, waiting to extract revenge for entering their domain..If you are a nature lover, or just interested in the unusual habits of little thought about creatures, GET THIS BOOK NOW!!!!"
4,An astounding glimpse into the lives of the predators which,"An astounding glimpse into the lives of the predators which surround us, often without our even noticing them. Mr. Grice provides a magical combination of science, folk lore and personal observation. This is a book which will hold the reader's attention to exclusion of the prickly feeling on the backs of our legs which it also occasionally induces. This is a must read for fans of Edward Wilson's Naturalist."
5,Funny and horrific,"This book bears as much relation to dry science texts as the cartoons of Charles Addams bear to real life. It's creepy, informative and delightfully engaging. My sweetie and I enjoyed reading it together in bed, where it's strange turns brought us closer together - in the center of the mattress, well away from dark edges where creepy crawlers lurk. No bleeding-heart liberal he, Gordon Grice is _still_ the kind of boy who likes keeping strange critters in jars and sometimes pitting them against each other. By showing us what he's learned in these staged confrontations, he raises the experience from sadistic sensationalism to memorable scientific examples. Highly reccomended!"
3,"One of a kind. A washington, dc institution.","I had a lot of mutual friends that knew Root real well and I used to see his shows and see him at parties. He was one of a kind. With songs like Xmas at Kmart, You took my mood ring, Dare to be Fat, Rich, White and Republican, and so many others, he was the sh*&t, for sure. He always had good backup musicians with him like Ron Holloway, and an awesome guitar player named Wayne. It's also crazy to realize that he went to Yale (for a while anyway). Another friend of mine Dick Bangham did most of his album covers, at least the early ones ... I also remember him coming into the record store I worked at to cash his disability check. This album is probably the weakest of the group, but if you check the web site I referred to, you might be able to email and get a line on where to get some of his recordings. Only those who knew him can probably fully appreciate his music. It is comedic and brutally satirical."
4,good!,worth reading. characters and story line are well connected and flow flawlessly throughout the book. was a really interesting story.
5,View of the sixties,Very good read. Following younger sister's quest for truth about older sister. Great portrayal of the youth movement in the sixties.
1,Disappointing.,"I suppose the book was slightly better than ""1 star"" but it definitely was not one that I would recommend to anyone else. The characters not only were unrealistic, but were very unsympathetic and for the most part, pathetic. The writing was fine, and the idea was intriguing; I would not necessarily foreclose reading anything else by this author sometime in the future. I just did not enjoy reading this book."
3,2nd half of the book is much better,"It is difficult for a novelist to focus on the inner thoughts of a depressed person who is living a constricted life. Egan does not rise to the challenge in the first 2 parts of this book. In fact, I found her prose mostly graceless in those parts with important exceptions; e.g. the scene with the ""Invisible Circus"" was very powerful. Both Egan's style, and the reader's interest improve markedly in the 2nd half of the novel. Egan does a good job in making sense of some of the more extreme subcultures of the 60's."
2,"The author has promise, but it's a disappointing read","The author clearly has talent in that the book reads beautifully. Unfortunately, the story never really comes together, and the characters are not fully fleshed; these defects become even more pronounced as the book moves towards its disappointing, dissatifying conclusion."
4,Hauntingly delightful....definitely worth reading!,"While this isn't one of my favorite books, ""The Invisible Circus"" was interesting and well-written enough to help pass by a few of many restless summer afternoons. I loved the vivid European imagery and Phoebe's recollections of her charismatic older sister, Faith. Jennifer Egan does a wonderful job of surrounding Faith with mystery. As Phoebe hungers to learn more of her sister's last days, so will the reader beg to know the circumstances surrounding Faith's adventures and downfalls in Europe. I agree with another reviewer, though....there are a couple of wildly unbelievable coincidences within this book. Yet, the suspense will lead you past these mild flaws and into the realm of unforgettable characters and settings. This book is the perfect mental road trip!!!"
4,Phoebe & Faith are wonderfully realistic.,"I thought the portrayals of Phoebe and Faith, Phoebe's obsession with Faith's charismatic personality, and the down side of that personality, were wonderfully realistic. This is one of my favorite books."
1,Means of support is only too visible.,"This novel left me feeling cheated of my time. The characters lack nuance, what little spark of originality the plot has to offer evaporates before the work even feigns to coalesce. The latter half of THE INVISIBLE CIRCUS in particular is so coarsely formulaic as to indeed earn comparison with the dimestore idiom. Is this book intended as romance fiction for readers who imagine themselves too upscale to purchase mass market paperbacks at the supermarket?"
1,"Second the ""Oh, Please""","I second the reviewer from Brooklyn (amen, sister). I was hankering after a good read about the sixties; however, I was sorely disappointed. I read on only because I thought perhaps there was something substantive that was eluding me. After finishing the book I concluded that its only benefit was to have learned how not to write fiction. Granted, there are some lovely passages, nice writing here and there, but by and large I found the book as a whole to be clunky, superficial, and contrived. What is truly shocking, however, is to read so many glowing reviews. It makes me wonder if there is any value whatsoever in using Amazon reviews as a yardstick."
2,nice form but no substance,"The writing is quite nice in some stretches, and the basic story COULD be a wonderful starting point......but it's NOT!! I was very disappointed in the book. Maybe it appeals to adolescent girls??"
2,cloying,"well-written melodramatic, self-absorbed hokum with a gee-everything-is-ok ending that really cloys"
3,hard to put a finger on,"i read this book fairly quickly and parts of it were certiantly interesting, but overall i was dissapointed. probably the part that i found most interesting was about the hippie era and how it ended. but pheobe was really hard to relate to; sometimes i could but mostly i couldnt. i guess i liked it while i was reading it but i didnt take much away with me."
2,B-O-R-I-N-G,"I could only make it half way through this book. It is so ""day in the life of"". Rather than slugging through the last half I decided to rent the movie rather than waste my time. I've now started ""Look At Me"", I hope this book by Jennifer Egan has more depth and will hold my interest."
3,"Works with XP, doesn't work with Vista!","If you have Vista and you are planning on getting this card, forget it. It does not work.Under XP, I was able to obtain excellent speeds of my drives (in excess of 45-50MB/s) which is not really possible with USB connections. Excellent hardware, but the driver support for Vista just isn't there. The OS has been available for over 9 months now, and Vantec (and/or its supplier) have refused to release Vista-compatible drivers. Get with the times!"
1,Doesn't play nice in Vista,The device may work but the device DRIVER doesn't. I tried to upgrade it but had no luck. The driver disables my mouse and some other USB-connected devices.
3,the card works great,but i should've done my research. Because of the limited speed of pcmciayou only get a gain of about 2MB/s over USB. So unless you have a periph that only supports esata and u don't have a pciexpress port don't bother
3,Nice,"I got this and the shoe is different then pictured, so im wondering is it a precious moments or a fake?"
4,Thoughts,"First off, me, being a bit of a marley fan, its completely possible my opinion *might* be a bit tainted :)But in all honestly I cant see how anyone who enjoys Ziggy on other albums doesn't enjoy this one. With so many different feels on the songs its one of my very favorites -Head Top has a strong dance hall style - while ""There She Goes"" is tender, emotional, with just enough beats per minute to keep it from being a slow dance song. ""African Herbsman"" and ""X Marks the Spot"" sound much like the style on ""One Bright Day"" which is my favorite. While he has lots of poppy and happy lyrics here also, ""World so Corrupt"" and others are always there to jump you back and show he's got a deeper side.Shannon"
3,"Decent plot, but...","The plot is an interesting one but stretches the boundaries of reality.I would have rated this read a '3', but unfortunately the translation from the original to the Kindle version leaves a lot to be desired. Clearly the formatting of the original did not transfer correctly, e.g. paragraphs of dialog between a group of people transition to dialog between a different group without paragraph, section or chapter breaks leaving the reader confused (at least in my case) until I re-read a few times. In some cases, I was left with the impression that pages or paragraphs were missing. Spelling errors are fairly common as well.It's nevertheless a fun read."
4,Pulls back the curtain,Uncovers many of the hidden parts of Japan with interesting and thought-provoking stories. Anyone interested in the culture of Japan should give this book a good reading.
2,Who is this about?,"I bought and read this book for a class and found it very difficult to take much away from. The accounts are potentially very enlightening, but the author's writing style obfuscates their values. Her interjection of her own personal stories into the work was sloppy and often left me unsure of who I was reading about. While I don't know of any other book which tells these stories, there are many other books that contain similar accounts which are far more effective."
2,An Ok Read If You Set Aside The Writers Whine,"The tiny vinettes that make up the book are truly worth the read, but to get past the authors continued psychological issues is extreamly difficult.When she finds out who she is - let me know, she will have something worth reading."
2,amazing Amazon return policies,"Did not work on older Intel ATX board. Documentation and mfg. web site was of little value.Earned 2 Star rating even though it did not work due to amazing Amazon return policies and procedures. I have been purchasing my electronics through NewEgg and Amazon is much, much better with returns."
2,Buggy but good performance,Had trouble booting and tech support was no help. The trouble continued to happen intermittently until I replaced it with LaCie 130823 eSATA PCI Card Design by Sismo. The problems went away immediately.
1,Will not work with anything but a flood light,It does not say so but this unit will not work with anything but a flood light and that is questionable. A fluorescent burns out in a couple hours and incandescent blinks and burns out. Only good if you need a high power flood light. I am returning mine and try to find something that will work in a porch light socket.
5,Lamson Flood Light Sock Control,This is a super prodcut to use for lighting your flag at night. It is weather proof with adjustable dusk to dawn contol. Works like a charm.
2,Dims light output.,"Maybe this works best with non standard CFL and florescent bulbs but I could not get it to work without minimizing the output. If that is not an issue for you, get it. The sensor works great."
1,Does Not Work,This item did not and would not work when installed on operational outside floodlight receptacle. I tried it for several different evenings and on different receptacles.
2,"they work, but fragile","I bought three of these, including one from the local hardware store. They have worked well thusfar in my 90 watt dual-bulb floodlight, which is mounted on the soffet on the northeast corner of my house. I'm away for work many months at a time, and I rely on lighting for security.Note: These are VERY fragile. Having read the reviews prior to installing these, I was very careful twisting these into the sockets. However, what I thought would be minimum force was too much as it twisted off the contacts below the bulb. So when twisting your bulb into the controller, STOP just short of what you feel would be necessary. It gives pretty easy."
2,This *was* a great book...,"...now it is seriously out-of-date. It reviews the 1998 and 1999 calendar years. Without an update by the authors it is, for all intents and purposes, useless.I really do hope the authors get someone to publish an update, because it was (as the authors rightfully state) the ultimate guide back in 1997 - 1999. A shame."
3,A good book for planning your first marathon.,"This book provides useful information to those new to the marathon game. While it is not a training guide, it does provide a comparative listing of the most popular marathons in the U.S. and Canada, including course descriptions, logistics, local hotels, and area attractions. Particularly useful is the 1 - 10+ rating system which includes Course Beauty, Difficulty, Race Organization, Crowd Support, and Appropriateness for First Timers. While this system is purely an objective one based on the opinions of the authors, I have found them to be ""dead on"". My only complaint is that while this book claims the be the ""Ultimate Guide"", it omits most of the smaller marathons, concentrating on the bigger and more popular races. Overall, this guide is well worth the price."
4,Great for 1998,"This was a very useful book when I bought it in 1999 to pick a marathon for 2000. Now, given how many marathons have changed their routes, increased their support, cancelled, etc., it's become outdated. I don't think there's a new edition out yet--I wish there was."
4,Fun family movie,"Really low budget, non-actors, family made movie that makes our family laugh and have a good time watching it.Better than lots of the crap that is out there on DVD."
1,I wouldn't really call it a night light!,"I purchased this night light for my 2-year old son for Christmas. It is adorable, but unfortunatly, it doesn't provide any light! I like to have a night light in his room which will provide a small amount of light if he wakes up or if I need to go in his room during the night, and I'm sorry, but this night light doesn't cut it! It has sat in the drawer unused ... it's a shame too, because he LOVES Blues Clues, and if it were brighter, it would be really adorable. I would recommend looking for another light ..."
2,There's got to be better out there.,"I recently moved back to Chicago and needed a map as a refresher. I was very disappointed when I received this map. It's great and handy, unfortunately it didn't cover the city. The map didn't show Bucktown or anything West but included all of the Southside. I was looking at moving into an area that I didn't have a map of!!! If you want to see any of Bucktown, Wickerpark or Logan Square do not buy this map."
5,streetwise map,"Great series of maps for residents and tourists. Very detailed but extremely compact (though still legible), laminated, folds easily. It can be used quite subtly, so you don't look lost (giving the apperance of a goofy out-of-towner, or worse, a safety issue.)Chicago Streetwise features:-Main map (north to Lakeview, south to Hyde park, west to Ukranian Village)-Downtown map-neighboring counties road map-Hyde Park/Kenwood detail-CTA/Metra train lines-street and landmark indexOn the main map, it identifies train stops (but unfortunately no busstop info, which may be helpful), street numbers, various important buildings (landmarks, colleges, some hotels, etc.).If you are planning on visitng Chicago, or have just moved to the area, look no further than this map."
1,Streetwise Chicago (Streetwise S.) (Map),This map does not show any of the parts of Chicago that I am interested in - mainly anything very far west of downtown. I would say that this item is not useful at all and a total waste of my money.
4,Broncos Newborn/Infant set,"I was happy with the Broncos Infant Creeper and Bootie set. However, I was a bit disappointed that the logo was only glued on. Other than that little item, the product is well worth it. I know my husband is especially thrilled."
3,marinco mini hidden horn,Item came in good shape with fast shipping.Had to make adjustment on the set screw in orderfor it to work and it is not very loud.
3,"""The Bible in History"" review","This book gives great insight to the various interpretations of certain passages in the scripture. Its down fall is its writing style, a hit boring."
3,"Read it for the ""why"" and not for the advice","Much of the content of the book is advice (primarily for women). Dr. Legato uses discoveries about male and female brain differences as the basis for advice, but the advice offered is not new or novel.I would have found the book more compelling if the author had stuck to the science she is qualified to write about.Five stars for the brain science half of the book; zero stars for the advice half."
2,Buy Flowers,Being a male I found this book very slow going and had to force my self to keep reading. Best advice buy flowers.
1,Don't waste your money.,"The book was good but it was from my personal opinion a reiterated advices book. So many of the things that were said i already knew because she copied some of the information or maybe some of the other relationship books I've read copy from her. Either way, if men and women WERE truly different then this should have solved alot of people's relationship problems. Also in my opinion, we are not all that different. We also want love, companionship, our egos stroked. etc.In conclusion, this is something you borrow from the library."
2,"Not the worst, but not that great","Meet Doctor Doom was an episode in the 1978 version of the Fantastic Four animated series that aired on NBC Saturday mornings. The episode is written by Stan Lee with storyboards attributed to Jack Kirby. It's a decent story, based on FF#5, with the boys going back in time to retrieve a treasure chest for Doom.In the 1978 series, the Human Torch (a character with a then-pending movie deal) was replaced by HERBIE the robot, and the extreme limits against violence made it very hard to pack much action in any episode. Given those drawbacks, this might be the best episode of the series, but that's like being the tallest jockey."
4,Pacific NW DVD,"I purchased this dvd for my boyfriend who currently lives in Toronto. He was coming out to visit me in Portland, Oregon, and had not been to the Pacific NW in more than 20 years. I wanted him to get a preview of my part of the world so he could be prepared and know what he was getting into. He is planning to relocate here next spring.He watched the dvd and said he enjoyed it, but that there wasn't that much coverage of Portland. He did find the Mount Hood raiload section alluring and memorable."
3,"Fast delivery, however slightly damaged","The delivery was very fast, and the product was exactly as shown, however there was a slight tear in the cover. It was not large enough for me to pay to send it back as it was 15$, and it would not be worth my money."
4,Good Value,"The Replacment Battery works like the orig one and the value was excellent, I would purchase another and would suggest you do as well"
1,Never arrived but charged my credit card.,How can I review a product that never arrived? Glad it was only around $5 with shipping.
4,very good for the price,"This battery is an excellent bargain and works great. I would have given it 5 stars but it doesn't fit in the carger as well as the original battery and loses contact unless you put a small piece of cardboard or something in to hold it against the contacts. It doesn't have this problem in the camera, only in the charger. It keeps it's charge well and works great."
3,A little bit late,"The battery has arrived a little bit late, but it's working. In short: the product seems to be okay, but the delivery time should be improved."
4,Decent Digital Camera Battery,The battery I purchased for my digital camera works perfectly well so far. I've only had it for about a month.
5,FLYII - The Greatest Flight Sim Ever!,"Folks,I have FLYII, Flights Unlimited, X-Plane and of course MSFS9. They all have their advantages. They are not games but simulators. Do you want to win a game, don't buy these. If you want to see what it is like to fly a plane, buy FLYII. The others I mention above are good too but I love FLYII. Flight Sims don't challenge you to win or get to the next level. They let you experience flight, navigation, Air Traffic Control. Many people are inspired to get their real pilots license because of Flight Sims.I saw some other reviews saying there is no support for FLYII. Please go to: www.avsim.com and http://fly.simvol.org/indexus.phpYou'll find hundreds of addons and a great forum with lots of friendly people to help. There are other site which offer addons, patches, forums and etc. Buy FLYII and get it installed and patched up to version 240. I think you'll be glad you did!Earl"
3,The best simulator on the market....but no support at all,"These flight simulator is the best and realistic on the market by far, but once you buy it, you are by your own, no support at all, and if you don't have a clue about how a real plane works, you're not going to be able to do much."
1,Like Demo-ware,Lacks maps (charts) from previous versions. Very poor support - download site (File Planet) so overloaded it is impossible to access. Manual must be downloaded. ILS systems flawed. DON'T BUY IT!
2,Not what it seems....,"The picture for the sheet set is very misleading. The top sheet does not have a large ""S"" on it. That is a picture of the comforter which is not available anywhere online. The real sheet has small S symbols in silver spread out on a sea of purple. I had custom S symbol window treatments made so I did not return. As mentioned the comforter does not exsist."
4,For tennis freaks,"This book is huge and is not to read for enjoyment. It is a book filled with stats, rules, and tons of information on tennis. Why would a normal person want to know all of this? He won't. Who would want to buy this? A tennis freak. What exactly is a tennis freak? He would be someone that plays tennis almost everyday if not every weekend at the very least. Someone who would play rain, snow, sleet, or shine. Someone who would tape all the best matches on TV and then analyze them frame-by-frame later. Someone whose conversation goes something like this: ""Remember the lob Edberg threw over Becker on the last set, eigth game at the 1990 Wimbledon? My God, that was the turning point of the entire match!"""
4,The best you can get in only one volume,"My brother, who lives in Boston, sent this book for me in 1998. It's really an encyclopedia, covering up the facts until 1996 (at least in my Edition). It's very fun reading, it has the rules of the game, the hiistory, the profiles of the top players of all generations. It only lacks in its editoring process, with a low material printing, but what matters is that the informations serve very well a tennis fan."
4,Johnny Guitar,"This is the first record of Johnny Winter that I heard. I watched his albums in stores but never listened to them. Then one of my friends gave it to me. I'm more fan of George Thorogood. But it is strange that when I put the cd in I can't take it out. There are few cathcy tunes, like the opener Johnny Guitar, She Likes to Boogie Real Low,...The cover of a christmas song Please Come Home for Christmas, that his duetting with his brother is kinda funny, but it's a good song anyway."
2,This book is not for total beginner.....,"This is a good book for one who is in training already. Yes it does have plenty of workouts and most of those consist of five measuring attributes: distance, walking time, pace, heart zone, effort. Now the first three parameters are quite easy to follow but it is not as easy for heart zone and effort. Of course, book gives you formulas, in order, to measure your max and rest heart rate, but... How do you know what is your heart rate zone now when you are walking? Easy enough-you have to buy heart monitor device or feel your heart rate as professional walkers do. So is it book for beginners. Not a chance"
2,FLUFF,"This book is mostly fluff. Everything important in it could be well written in about 10 pages. The workouts which comprise about half the book are quite useless. If you want to find out what race walking, power walking, and fitness walking are all about I recommend ""The Complete Guide to Racewalking: Technique and Training"" by Dave McGovern available here at amazon.com."
4,Microtek Scanmaker 4800,"I bought this scanner and I scanned one picture. Then it broke. But since I liked this scanner, and since PC World ranked this scanner #1 at the time I sent it back to Microtek. You call their number from their website and get the shipping information then you ship it, the whole process was really easy. Then they sent me a new scanner for absolutely free, and since then it has worked really great."
2,Microtek Scanner Software issues,This scanner's software drivers have a utility called SDII.exe that has a nasty habit of taking over the CPU resources while running under Windows XP (Pro). The hardware itself seems pretty sound. (I used to run the scanner on a computer using Windows 98 before I upgraded the computer and operating system). Microtek has seemed less than helpful in supporting this product.
3,good but,"The scanner has been good for everything I scanned except some photo's. Most photo's have spots on them after scanning that I can't seem to get rid of no matter what I do to try to adjust it. The picture they use to do adjustments is too small to see what you are doing. It will look good but then when you save it and go in to look at it, it still isn't right. It could be a little faster too. I don't understand why it will scan some photo's well and some are really bad. I cleaned it as directed and still it came out bad. Not my choice of scanner from now on. Will go to Cannon."
3,Microtek Scanmaker 4800,"Unfortunately, this scanner I purchased died within 24 hrs after installation. The photo I scanned before this occurred come out wonderfully. The scanner comes bundled with excellant software but the scanner is noisey compared to the Umax Astra 2100U it replaced. I returned this scanner and decided to spend a little more money for a Microtek Scanmaker 4900. I'm hoping when I receive this scanner it will prove to be more durable."
1,Dissatisfied,"I am unhappy with the purchase. It didn't work. The postage was not worth me shipping it back. The merchant whoever never answered my request to return it. I think the scanner had a broken part in it, it was used. I trashed it since it was of no value to me. I purchased another scanner from Best Buy.Will give second thoughts to other purchases that are used items."
4,"good, dsii.exe has a bug tho","...referring to the SDII.exe process taking up all of your CPU time. I too have this problem (windows XP), but I have discovered ...that the application is only used to monitor the scanner's front panel buttons-- if you disable DSII.exe in the startup manager, you'll be fine.In all, I love the scanner, and I never use the front panel buttons anyway..."
3,Great Scanner - Issues with Vaio and XP,"I had the same problem ... in that with XP on a Vaio computer, a program called ""SDII.exe"" forces the CPU to run at 100% and makes other tasks freeze. When i unplug the scanner, the problem goes away. Sony and [a local store] support technicians have helped me tremendouly with no success. I had used the scanner on a different computer, and the scanner itself is a great scanner, highly reccommended to people without Sony Vaio computers."
1,Worst Software ever to use,"I bought this scanner from BJ's wholesales club and used it for 2 weeks. I am a software engineer who works with computers for living but I could not figure out how to use this software. This is the first product in my life which comes without a manual. It comes with a one sheet documentation . For example: It says how to use ""Advanced set up"" but it never writes a way how to invoke advanved mode. It took me 2 hours to figure out how to invoke advanced mode.After all those efforts I was able to use it to scan my 8 x 10 photo graph and the scanning quality seems resonable good. Then I printed the photo and it came out green tainted. I have no idea why this is happening but for sure I am done with this scanner. To make sure there is nothing wrong with my printer I printed another photo from my digital camera and it comes out great. I have not decided which scanner to buy but I feel like going for some HP scanner.My recommendation: Buy a reputed company product."
2,light lid problems,"I think it is a good scanner, but I bought it to do slides. Light Lid came with it but never turned on...."
1,TERRIBLE MANUFACTURING,"I did not purchase this item from Amazon.com, but I was curious to read reviews about this scanner. Like another customer, I too received 2 of these scanners from an online purchase: on both, the glass was not properly attached to the scanner, and one came with broken glass. This poor manufacturing is inexcusable."
2,Poor supply,"If you order this, be ready to wait a while.....a long while....llike until next year.....new technology might come out by then....then you can use it as a paper weight."
2,Not what I wanted,This book is hard to understand. This author has written a lot of incomplete sentences. And lots of run on sentences. This is the worst book in all of my history classes that I have taken. Another issue I had with this book is paragraphs do not flow with each other. Information is cut in pieces and it hard to understand. Also the information is vague and does not give a clear detail description of each paragraph. I would avoid this book if you can. This book makes the class very difficult. I am network architect engineer and engineers learn by detailed steps. This book does not give me this type of concept.
1,Not quite right...,This necklace looked like a cheap piece of bad costume jewelry. Not the $29 price tag for sure. I don't recommend it to anyone.
1,Isn't worth the price.,Would not suggest this to anyone. Much smaller than anticipated and is not worth the price or time it took to receive it. Also it came in a plastic bag with no box.
1,looks cheap,"The pendant looks really cheap even comparing with other cheap diamond silver jewelery. The chain is not shiny looks oxidized. If you were able to see the diamonds you'll find them opaque, dark colored, does not sparkle at all and some of them are broken. The packaging is the only good thing. I would not recommend it."
5,"Good, Quality Jewelry","I bought this as a gift since it was on the ""Deal of the Day"".The price was right. I was even more impressed with the quality. It is very eye catching and the light catches the diamonds real nicely. The chain is nice and durable.It is definitely a good, quality piece of jewelry."
5,INTERESTING BIRD!,"If you're looking for something funny and funky, something that is a conversation piece, get the roadrunner pendant! It's very detailed, has different textures in it and is very shiny. Plus it's size allows everybody to know what you have hanging on your neck chain.Did you know that:1.Roadrunners are in most all southwestern states?2.Roadrunners are quick enough to catch and eat rattlesnakes?3.Roadrunners prefer walking or running and attain speeds up to 17 mph. hour?4.Roadrunner is also called the Chaparral Cock?5.Roadrunner reabsorbs water from its feces before excretion?6.Roadrunner's nasal gland eliminates excess salt, instead of using the urinary tract like most birds?7.Roadrunner is the state bird of New Mexico?That's how interesting they are!"
3,"A few good tracks, but kinda boring.","I'm a fan of both King Crimson and David Sylvian, but this album didn't do a whole lot for me. I thought it was kind of boring. It is certainly more of a Robert Fripp album than a David Sylvian album, and I guess I'm more of a David Sylvian fan than a Robert Fripp fan. If you love everything Fripp does, you'll probably like this. I like stuff like Sylvian's ""Secrets of the Beehive"" which this is nothing like."
5,"excelent, but...","This is, musically speaking, an excelent album, and I love to hear Robert Fripp playing guitar as brilliant as ever, alongside with stick master Trey Gunn. But the album, IMO, don't express the spirit of David Sylvian. This album is almost a King Crimson album! I'm sure to be one of the greatest fans of King Crimson in the World, but in this album only Fripp seems to eath the cake!"
2,Bad rockin dudes,"David Sylvian doesn't rock, and this record proves it. He sounds unconvincing trying to wrap melodies over powerchords, and most of the songs are therefore melodically weak. A great find for Fripp fans, but Sylvian fans should get hold of the live document ""Damage"" which also makes a lot of useless noise but reimagines some fine moments from Brilliant Trees and Rain Tree Crow and, best of all, features two of Sylvian's best songs, the title track and ""The First Day."" Both tracks, it should be noted, barely feature the other musicians."
3,A Question,"There are ""two"" George Bensons--the one who plays good jazz--e.g. on the Cookbook album, and then the one who plays syrupy pop. I can't tell from your 2 reviews here which category this one falls into. Can anyone tell me?"
3,Great for the beginning programmer,"This book is for the beginning programmer, wanting someplace to start his journey in the world's favourite development tool and the world's best database. The author gets everything nearly right, except fails to investigate possible errors that occur in the ""real world"" of database programming."
4,Good current overview of the interaction VB and Oracle.,"I think this is the only book dedicated solely to the interaction of VB and Oracle.Seems to be an update and extension of the author's 1997 VBPJ article. This books appears overly verbose at times. I look forward to a new article based on this book! Takes the reader from beginner to medium level programmer, doesn't seem to be particularly advanced.One or two programming errors should have been discovered by the book's reviewers e.g. listing 17.11 has duplicate variable definitions.More code examples would be welcomed, together with more suggestions on the prefered 'solution' to interacting with Oracle from VB.A good effort."
2,A little Misleading,This book is really the vb programmer's guide to Oracle. This is a good general reference but it does not get into depth on visual basic side. THis book would be good for someone with little knowledge of how Oracle works.
2,A big dissapointment from a masters hand.,"The book is very hard to get through. The story is almost not appareant and the caracthers are not comming fully to life. Especially Thomsons poetry, which normally is liberating, becomes suffocating and only rarely enjoyable, the most powerfull being the red sea, even though this symbol seems to be empty, which is the general assesment of the book as a hole. Parden my bad spelling."
3,Garmin European Travel Guide for Nuvi,"I would rate this as fair. It does not rate or show all of the restaurants and stores nearby as you are walking down a street. It does show many which are more than 1 mile away, which is exactly what you do not want if you are walking. You can locate a store, restaurant, hotel or tourist attraction by name, which is good."
2,Not a good Guide,"Unlike the other reviewers I had a Nuvi with maps and knew how to use it. Unfortunatly this ""guide"" provides little other than the points of interest that are already part of the Europe Navigator software loaded on the unit. No descriptions of what is there or hours, prices etc like a guide should have. You will need to have Navigator Europe v9 in any case to have the maps. One other complaint is that the locations are all in the native language so you cannot find the Eiffel Tower since that is la tour de effel or something. Not very useful."
1,Buy a parachute for Europe,"Try getting your money back after it fails. A dark screen after loading the SD card. Called Garmin, placed on hold for 20 minutes, was told that it doesn't work unless the unit picks up the satellites in Europe. So, who do you call with a dark screen in downtown Strausbourg and won't be home until the return date has lapsed? AMAZINGLY, I was also told that the software has no maps (that cost another $300). This Travel Guide is nothing more than a glorified electronic tour book that you can pick up for $20 in hardcopy and with real maps! They call this dumming up."
1,Missing Maps,"I rated this product very low since I had assummed that I was ordering a street finder for Europe and was very disappointed when I arrived in Switzerland, rented a car and tried to use the map function. The advertizing for the SD Data Card led me to believe that it was all inclusive. Unfortunately, I paid the data card and it would only identify locations such as airports, train stations, food places and fuel stations but it would not direct me to any of these locations. I would really like to have my money returned if possible."
1,Routing questionable,"Used this in The UK and France. Routings showed me a lot of those countries that I didn't need to see. That is, the routings were neither direct nor easy."
1,Does not work in Europe as it says,It was the worst thing I could ever do. Trusting you vacations on something like this may bring you lots of headaches and pains. I traveled to Spain and Germany and the first thing I noticed upon my arrival was that the SD card was not being read nor working on my Nüvi 260. I took my GPS device for a check and they said it was the card that was not working properly. I had no other choice than to buy a new GPS device for Europe so I could drive for the rest of my trip. I will return the SD Card back to the shipper and ask for my money back asap.
1,GARMIN 010-10672-02 Nuvi Europe Travel Guide,"DO NOT BUY Does not work. I went to Europe and tried this GPS navigation card, and it recognized that I was in Europe and it had plenty of points of interest to choose from but it showed no roads and had no idea on how to get me where I wanted to go. Very unhappy. And I checked the return policy and it states that it is only returnable within 24 hours, which was hard to do because I was in Europe. NO NOT BUY"
1,Item not same as pictured!,"I was extremely dissapointed with this item. Not only did it look nothing like the picture, but it was also of a cheaper quality! When I went to return it, processing took forever even after I paid extra money to have it shipped back to them within 2 days. I would not suggest this or any other item from this vendor."
4,Fatherhood Rediscovered,"Fathers are important. This is really the central theme of ""We Fish."" Jack Daniel reflects back on how his father shaped his life and how he helped shape his son.Both good and bad, men have a significant role in the raising of children, especially boys. This is sometimes downplayed in our society. It should, in fact, be celebrated.Fathers and sons need to connect. In the Daniel family, they connect through their fishing trips. Fishing outsdie of their family group is ""just fishing."" This is opposed to when they are together when it becomes ""the fever."""
1,Golden Oldies,"As I listened to the 30 second samples, not one song seemed to be by the original artist. Some of the sample tunes did not match the title of the song on the track listing. I would check all of the sample tunes before you buy this one. Some of them were horrible."
3,Neneh should have more industry clout,"A gifted songwriter, singer and entertainer who can craft hits and messages to make folks go .... Huh? which is good while tapping out good beats. Enjoy her skills."
4,Good follow up from Raw like Sushi,"This is very different from her debut 'Raw like Sushi', in between these 2 discs, Neneh recorded the song 'I got you under my skin', for an Aids benefit, this song is another gem. There is not a bad track on this one, the standouts are 'Money Love', Somedays, Buddy X and Trout, and to a lesser extent, Move with me and Twisted. Trout is an awesome track, with neneh and stipe singing and sampling led zeppelin, what more do you want on a track??This is Neneh's last great work, her next CD had some great moments (7 seconds/trouble man/woman) but Homebrew is a great collective piece of work. This is not a classic like Raw like Sushi, but it's still a very good CD."
3,Early prog. influenced Steve Hillage album,"This album is probably a lot heavier in feel than you might expect from Steve Hillage, but the inclusion of two members of the Crazy World of Arthur Brown, may have alot to do with it.I find the vocals melodramatic in style and can sometimes detract from the complex music presented here.There are some great moments, especially between Hillage on guitar and Dave Stewart on organ (both went on to greater things with ""Gong"",""Hatfield and the north"" and the album ""Fish Rising"").Although the music is varied in feel the style gets a bit samey after a while; its an interesting album to hear these musicians playing early in their careers, but I found it fairly hard going, and wouldn't put at the top of my list of must haves!!"
5,One of the most under-rated albums in prog,"Khan was a short lived British prog rock band. Space Shanty was the only album as far as I know but it is a beauty. It features some great guitar work from Steve Hillage and any album that has Dave Stewart on keyboards has a head start. The sound is Canterbury-based, and the album would appeal to Caravan and Hatfield and the North fans, but there is more than that here. Hillage was a great rock guitarist and some of the riffs are heavy. Accompanied by Stewart's screaming keyboards the band rocks. Nick Greenwood and Eric Peachey are a solid rhythm section. Space Shanty is one of the forgotten albums of prog but well worth checking out."
5,SPACED,"PERHAPS THE BEST ""SPACE ROCK"" ALBUM OF ALL TIMEI WISH I DISCOVERED IT IN THE SEVENTIESIT WOULD HAVE BEEN A PERFECT COMPANION ON A TRIP"
5,brilliance,"I highly recommend this album to all Camel and Caravan fans.What most impresses me about this Khan album is the way the album sounds. Just listening to the way it sounds, it's very clean and polished, and it even sounds commercial. So why wasn't it a commercial success? I have no idea why.The instrumental jams closely remind me of what Camel would be doing a few years later such as on the Mirage album, and most of them are quite good and soothing. Maybe they could stand to be a little more melodic, but that's not much of a complaint really. The vocal melodies are adventurous in an atmospheric way, similar to Alan Parsons Project or Pink Floyd. The album is simply a joy to listen to.If you love 70's music, especially creative bands who keep the atmosphere and melody flowing at the same time (so the music contains an interesting flow the entire time without ever becoming boring) this album is for you."
1,Not 3M,BEWARE! Not a 3M product.Off brand of unknown quality. Smells much of SCAM!Shows up as 3M in search. Deceiving trick by manufacturer or reseller. Sneaky.
1,Does not work at all,"I just recieved the TDK Professional Lens Cleaner (2box) and it does not work. I have 3 dvd players and in all of them it does not read the disk. It says loading or read, then says no disc or error. I did contact the TDK live help line and they were not helpful except to say that I should exchange it. I may be a bad cd but it was brand new and very expensive. I would choose another more inexpensive one if you buy online due to the hassle of exchanging items."
4,"Vibrant, often beautiful music","Instrumental compositions with strong klezmer and jazz elements, this music is challenging, passionate, and accessible."
2,For the pro,I am the average boat owner and wanted a manual that would tell me the things that I could do to maintain this motor. This manual goes to the pro level and covers stuff that I would have done by a professional.
2,2004 mercury,includes toooo many different motors. It did not go into the detail for my motor. lots of cases it did not address my motor.
3,Good Swiss yodel,"I like this CD, but not as much as his others, including Volksmarsch.Kerry is one of my favorites.This CD didn't have enough of the Swiss yodel to suit me, but it was as advertised; contaning both country and swiss."
2,"OK, but not great","A movie in the genre of the secret. I was expecting better. It may have had a few words of wisdom, but my overall impression: worthless canned copycat phoniness."
3,More of a dance album than what you would expect from OMD,"Liberator is an average album at best. It is not as good as Sugar Tax. There are some really good toe-tapping songs such as Dollar Girl, Stand Above Me and Dream of Me. However, it is more of a dance album and it lacks the experimenalism that OMD is known for."
2,Low Point For OMD,"Andy & Paul have done some great work, but this wasn't it. Their songs are lacking any catchy sounds, the music sounds really forced, as do the lyrics. You'd be better off getting an earlier album or their Greatest Hits."
4,Written in a truthful manner,"Gennifer Flowers had a lot to say. Unfortunately, this book is mistitled. It contains excellent historical data and shows the light side, the dark side and an ongoing dishonest side of a President of the United States of America. Gennifer is believable. She has been vindicated in more ways than one."
1,You'd have thought...,"...Gennifer would have picked up a few new insights or at the very least a couple new words/ways of expressing what had to be some intertesting experiences since 1992....but sadly, this is often a word-for-word repeat of her other book. President Clinton knows how to pick them...so even when they write a ""tell all"" they simply haven't a good enough grasp of the English language to make it interesting. If he ever picked someone with more than a fifth grade vocabulary...watch out America!"
1,Non-Fiction?,"The people that believe Eula Mae Flowers and consider her ""story"" relevent have not bothered to find out the facts."
2,I was disappointed,"I was a bit disappointed in this DVD. Because I plan to go to Cameroon next year, I was looking for something that would more give me broader information about the people and cultures. I felt it was more about the animals than people. But I got to see some nice visuals of the country."
2,Don't waste your money,"The producers/makers of this video focused solely on the black culture of Cameroon, and totally ignored the caucasian descendents of English and French origin. Furthermore, the producers focused on some of the more bizarre aspects of Cameroon such as fortune telling and a king with 50 wives. There's a significant Baptist community in Cameroon which was completely ignored. The Lutheran Church in Cameroon has 215,000 members, which was also completely ignored."
4,Runs Big,"I purchased these same shirts a year ago in a store size XXL which fit perfectly. I ordered the same shirts from another website a little later and they ran way too long in the sleeves and hem. I purposely ordered a smaller XL this time from Amazon and they are still too big! I don't know if Russell makes them differently now or what. I am a big guy so this shocks me. It probably wouldn't bother me but I like to wear them under an open button down shirt for the layered effect. Besides the size issue, I love these comfortable, easy care tees."
4,Good quality buy,As usual Russell puts out a great shirt. It looses a star because the XL size was a bit big on me-ever other XL shirt fits fine!
4,Really Shocking,"Ok the movie is the first one from director Fito Paez a great musician from Argentina, and you realize that. I think that the plot and music are not strong at all. On the other hand the cast is really good. Cecilia Roth and Jael Garcia are the best of the movie. The history is kind of shocking and by end you know what is going to happen but keep crossing your fingers for that not to happen. For people that is not from south or central america maybe this movies is a 2 or a 3 but people who really know what happen in those years there know that this could be a new door that open to finally find the truth so stories like these wont happen.In the overall i think is good begining for Fito Paez and right now he is rolling his second movie so we will see how much he improve"
2,"achieves little, despite the great acting...","this movie is dissapointing, albeit the great perfomances by both Garcia Bernal and Cecilia Roth. Cecilia Roth plays the role of a mentally unstable woman in her 40s who falls in love with 22 year old Garcia Bernal. The movie fails in giving the audience enough to make the story-line believable. Never understood why/how Garcia Bernal falls in love to a woman that only gave orders, didn't show her face and almost didn't talk. This just an example of many other events that come out of nowhere. The ending is abrupt and one is left with the feeling of having wasted 2 hours."
5,Unique movie and theme - great movie with an inspiring message,A unique movie that highlights the poor state of India's sports and the apathy experienced by sportswomen. This could be among the best SRK performances and lacks all of the usual overacting that is his trademark. The movie proves that Bollywood can make highly entertaining movies and can do without the usual song and dance numbers while carrying a valuable social message. This movie rates 5 stars just for being more inventive than all the other dull-as-dishwater films that Bollywood churns out (mostly). The next movie should be about the abysmal Indian cricket team.
5,Interesting but not your song & dance type Bollywood,"The other reviews of this movie pretty much cover it. I just want to add that this is a more realistic and thoughtful movie that is more about uniting the regional differences of India into a cohesiveness as a national identity.I'm not a sports lover yet I found the hockey quite watchable. It isn't so much a sports movie but rather a story about personalities and nation.SRK is restrained but excellent. He is not really the main focus of the movie though as he steps back and allows the girls centre stage. Given that they are mostly unknowns and not even actors mostly the girls did a great job.A world match is played out in Melbourne (where I am from) and I must say they made the place look good - made me want to visit it!While there is background music, this isn't a song and dance Bollywood - no dances and one sporting song.I benefited in my understanding of India from watching it and it is a movie they can be justly proud of."
5,Wonderful Sport Film!,"I am a Shah Rukh Khan fan and I loved this film. I loved seeing him play the role of a coach. It was neat to see how he was able to unite the team and help them all be better players. In the final moments of their most critical match, it was especially impactful to see how Shah Rukh Khan helped the goalie succeed. I really enjoyed watching this film."
1,Sloppy Work,"Whether or not the author got the facts (mostly) right, the grammar is so bad as to make the book almost unreadable. This guy is a professor? Bad news for academia! The writing is so bad that it makes you wonder if his reporting of facts and opinions is as badly flawed. The maps and graphics are obviously poorly reproduced copies of military briefing slides. They are so poorly rendered that they are almost illegible. This is a really bad book!"
3,The Book Fell Apart,"The content of the book is excellent, just like everything else Zodhiates writes. Unfortunately it is cheaply printed and the pages started fall out when I was on page 9. I called the publisher and they are going to replace it, but it shouldn't be so poorly made."
3,"Binding too tight, book will not lay flat, gutter margins too small","The content is wonderful. I have a paperback published in 1987. The pages are secure and seem to be sewn, but the binding is so tight that it is hard to spread the pages open wide enough to read the text. The center pages have about 1/2 inch white margin from the edge of the printed text to the binding, but the majority of the front pages and back pages of the book barely have 1/4 inch. I have to tilt my head to read the text that curves too close into the binding. I wish the publisher had made the binding to lay flat and the center margins (gutter) much wider. When open to the center pages, the spine curves up to form a tunnel and the pages fan like a peacock."
2,Hard to read,"This was very hard to read due to editing and structure. Run-on paragraphs, illogical divisions, etc. There were literally no paragraphs on some pages. Small print didn't help."
4,A great book for Big Ten football fans,"This is a terrific book capturing the essence of die-hard Big Ten football. The book was published in 1989 so it is a little dated, some places mentioned, such as Papa Joe's in Columbus, don't exist anymore. Nonetheless, Bob Woods moves from week to week through one season, vividly describing the sights, sounds and atmosphere of each Big Ten (before Penn State) campus. My husband and I follow the University of Iowa through every season and both concur that the author has painted an accurate picture of football fall in the midwest."
5,Ariel Kill Us All,"I recently got this cd off of a friend of mine and it is amazing. If you like death cab for cutie, appleseed cast, or last days of april, you will love this cd. Each song is uniquely crafted to perfection, I really suggest getting this cd."
3,Ariel Kills..,"..in a good way though. i really enjoyed a few of the selections off ""In the Pyramid"".Alot of the softer more poppier tracks take on a pretty hypnotic life of their own, especially ""Alarm"", which could double as the last dance at an indie prom night, or ""Jimi Hendrix"", which sounds nothing like Jimi Hendrix.But while half of the cd is dreamy and sweet, some of the songs are a bit irratating.But overall, i suggest this disc for fans of dreamy indie pop alas Jimmy Eat World's Clarity, with an electronic tinge."
4,Girl Power,"During the dark days and nights of the bombing in London during WWII, a group of women must learn to cope and carry on while the men are otherwise engaged. The women had to learn to survive in a new world. A world once occupied by men. The women must learn to make decisions and turn their lives around not knowing if they will have the men home again. This book describes the fear of sitting in a shelter with the bombs raining down. The loss of life and the homes they had known for generations. The rationing of food and clothing and trying to feed a family. The war was won because of the strength of character of the British people and that includes the women who kept the home fires buring. Let us not forget the women who stayed home, waiting."
4,Great memories,"I bought this CD to replace an old cassette. I have always loved Loudon Wainwright and missed hearing his songs. This is one of my favorite releases, it covers all of his sides...both silly and brooding. I have been enjoying it!"
3,An interesting plot in need of a better writer,"An interesting ""what if"" premise made tedious by less than inspired and very choppy writing. As this is his first book one can forgive the author, but not his editor. The writer is overly fond of evanescence in its various forms. Such a distinctive word used several times is annoying and should have caught the attention of an experienced editor. And by the way, the hero can certainly take a licking and keep on ticking...again and again and again. A few less descriptive beatings might have left a little more room for character development which is very much needed. One of the reasons I got the book was the glowing blurb by Daniel Silva. What was he thinking?"
2,Minor league,"This is very minor league Ken Follett or Frederick Forysth. The plot moves because it has to, the german is a shadow of Hannibal Lecter and the hero, while physically suffering, somehow finds the ability to continually escape from the mental institution he finds himself in. There are so many good WW2 spy novels around there is really no reason to devote much time to this. Very disappointing and it did not make me want to read any more of his titles."
3,Just a good spy mystery,"this fictional storyline fits well with the time frame, December 1941. The key character Tom Wall as a shell shocked warrior fighting for the English via Canada builds a good profile for that time period.Sondegger's knowledge about the upcoming Japanese attack and how this information gets to the Germans, is curiously odd. But it feeds the mystery and your interest.This one triggers a ""What if this was fact"" thought. Keep that in mind as you read it.."
2,Follett lite,"A WW2 spy saga with all the requisite scenes, characters and cliches. Not the worst, but well short of the high water mark that the likes of Follett, Forsyth, Higgins etc have set in this genre. I'd suggest you read those guys' efforts first before you look at this one. Two and half stars."
1,Do not waste your time on this book as I did.,"I like to imagine the movie that a book would be while I am reading it and this one would be unwatchable because of: one dimensional characters; a flimsy plot with huge holes in it; and things that do not make sense. I could see Anthony Hopkins / Hannibal Lechter as the Hun and Adrien Brody / Guy in The Piano as Tom Wall - if you could convince them to be in a horrible movie. I was hoping for a payoff at the end, but it did not happen!"
5,A bit different but enjoyable,"The approach, with the main character a bit battle-damaged, is a little different and I found it refreshing. Thomas Wall is a rather messed up, is single-minded in his desire to find his brother with the apparent intent to kill him, and is being used by almost everyone. I thought the plot interesting but understandable. I think if you liked John Lawton's ""Blackout"" you would also like this."
1,Disappointed,I found the book confusing and the use of English expressions over done. I have no idea why some words were in a bold font.
5,Best science teacher/author out there,"Dr. Wile can explain anything to anyone. If you homeschool or just need to understand your (or your kid's) science to get through a class, this author gives the clearest explanantions anywhere!"
3,Small Sizing,"I wear size 8 shoes. Normally in heels I wear a 7.5, but I bough an 8 anyway, to be safe. This shoe runs a size smaller than your actual shoe size. I have to return the pair I bought for a 9."
1,"Would love to rate this product, if I had it.","Two days over due, shipper blames sellers, and I am barefoot! Need these shoes tomorrow, now I will look like a fool! Thanks so much!! :-("
5,Very Entertaining!!!,"I loved It! As always, Eddie's comments through the super are hilarious!! He just keeps putting his feet in his mouth. It's like one long Eddie Murphy Albulm!!!"
3,Modelling at the continuum scale,"With the increased power and availability of computers, computer aided modeling is becoming more prevalent in various fields of engineering. One important example is modelling of stress, strain, and flow (plastic solid and liquid) at the continuum level. Examples of this are finite element analysis, finite difference analysis, Monte Carlo simulations, and the random walk. This book covers all of these topics and generally serves as a good introductory textbook to learn about modelling at the continuum scale. The mathematical treatment is very brisk though, and requires prior knowledge of linear and partial differential equations, linear algebra, and basic computing."
5,Great Cd,This is a very rare item so I just had to have it. Countess Vaughn is an amazing singer with such a beautiful voice. Keep in mind that this album was released in the early 90s so you know what the music sounded like back then lol. But all in all I think it was a good cd
2,does anybody even remember this album,her music career is dead and her acting has failed a shame after the parkers all she did was do fit club and forgotten reality show gigs.
1,Author wouldn't know a hockey puck if it hit him in the face,"Jeff Jacobs is possibly the least talented sportswriter in the world, and I say this as a resident of a town that hosts the NY Daily News and NY Post. It is now my goal in life to find Jeff Jacobs and waste an amount of his time equal to the amount of time I spent reading his book, which was approximately 30 minutes until I decided my fireplace needed more kindling. This was back in June.The Biblical book of Job is easier to read than this hack. My 5-year-old nephew writes more intelligently. If it weren't for spell checkers in the editing process his sentences probably wouldn't have periods. Or spaces between words.On top of all this, Jeff Jacobs is a bad human being, who would likely use his position as columnist in a hartford newspaper to personally attack the lifestyle and hobbies of a coworker just out of spite, and likely because that coworker refused to share secrets with him. Not that this has ever occurred, of course."
1,Pretty poor book,No consistency. Poorly written. Finished reading the book with an idea that the author put this book together on a few raint weeekends.
1,i found this book,"in the Buck a Bookstores located throughout the New England region.Shockingly enough, my book was in the stores too.I'm investigating if Pedro, Manny or Jurassic Carl were involved with that happening."
4,slow start,"It seemed to take forever to get this story going.I really enjoy Karen Robards, but this was slow goingStory is interesting and full of suspense."
1,Can't finish,"""You ever been raped? Want to try it?""The 'hero' asks Lora this after he strips, gags, and ties her to a bed. I'm only 65 pages in but I won't be reading any more of this book. Personally I do not find threats of rape and eventual Stockholm Syndrome sexy. And it's pretty disturbing to find these things, not in true crime or psychological thriller, but in the romantic suspense genre."
1,It was a DNF for me!,"Robards is hit or miss for me. I don't write alot of reviews, but had to on this one. I made it through about 100 pages before giving up. The ""hero"" and I use that term very loosly, was a sadistic D.B.! The""heroine"" was a TSTL. If your into abduction and rape threats then this is the book for you. I couldn't finish this, because I don't see how any author could redeem either of these characters. If I had the option, I wouldn't have given it even one star. Stockholm syndrome is sooo not romantic!"
1,DNF,"This is the first book that I have tried to read by Karen Robards. As it plodded along I found myself bored and making myself read on. I hardly ever do not finish a book. However, I just couldn't get in to the story. I didn't even get to the sex. I got tired of the threats of rape and murder and the TSTL heroine. I will however at some point try another book by this author because I have ""heard"" that she is a very good author. Perhaps this just wasn't one of her better books."
3,"Good, but not great.","This hero had a lot of baggage, and I guess we're supposed to excuse his mean attitude (which doesn't improve much over the course of the story), out of sympathy for him. It doesn't work. The writer does keep you on the edge with the story line itself. I just prefer a hero, with or without past ghosts, to still be portrayed in a better light. He could have been abrupt and still have had a conscience. After the second time he calls the heroine a b---h, I knew what I was in for. It was as if we're never supposed to like him. And there were many ""emotion"" repetitions. Like ""I wish I had a penny for every time he said..."" This was an interesting story, but I did contemplate putting it down for something that makes you feel good. It's definitely not a keeper."
4,"Very Good, But Lacks Style","After playing sections of this CD against the Steinberg Pittsburg CD of the same piece it is pretty clear that, 1. Steinberg is probably a better Beethoven conductor than Dorati, and, 2. The Pittsburg CD taken from magnetic tape is a different but equally valid and effective way to record an orchestra. Which latter is saying a lot, given the quality of the Mercury engineers' work. Finally I think Steinberg elicts a more stylish sound from his musicians, with the sections blending better - those who prefer their Beethoven a little rough will probably prefer the Doarti. So if you wish an excellent energetic version of this symphony you will be very happy with this performance by Dorati, but you might also consider the more stylish Steinberg perfomance with Pittsburg."
1,Not what I thought it was!,"I ordered a heavy duty chain because I have a big dog,it is a French Mastiff and what I got was a thin chain,it was not a heavy duty. I ended up having to go to a local store and finding a chain that was a lot thicker then the so called heavy duty chain I got from Amazon.com"
3,They don't know how to teach . . .,"I've owned this product for several weeks now, after having completed the only (introductory) course offered by Pimsleur. Sorry, guys, but this audio CD course presumes that one can master a dozen new words in 30 seconds, pushing you right into a real-time conversation after only having heard the parts once. You can learn some helpful phrases, if you listen to the same lesson 10 times (eventually, you can catch on). However, the method of learning is quite inferior. The only saving grace is that it does have a decent book that comes with the 2 CD's. If you study the book, you can learn a lot of words, and listening to the CD's will give you the proper pronunciation. I just wish Pimsleur would offer a complete course in all of their available languages, because they are the best! My suggestion - buy Pimsleur to get started, then get a good dictionary and an Indonesian friend."
3,read and listen ...,"I bought this thinking I can pop the audio cd in my car and ride around and listen to this and learn bahasa. Like I did with pimsleur mandarin chinese. Well, you can't do that with these audio disc's. You have to sit down with the book and audio cd's and listen and read along. So annoying if you don't have the time to do this.My car cd player wasn't seeing the tracks correctly and I couldn't start at the beginning of the lessons I wanted. I went forward from lesson 1 and it went to lesson 8. Tried to get back to lesson 1 and it took me to the very beginning .... I'm going to have to RIP this cd to a new cd and isolate the lessons track by track. I'm going to give this 3 stars based on this unfunctionality of this disc."
4,Beautiful Illustrations,"This small board book briefly looks at the lives of wolves and their environment. The text looks at packs, dens, sleeping habits, other animals in the environment, territory, and the need for conservation. The illustrations are very beautiful."
5,Melrose Place: Sixth Season V.1,"As an avid fan of the series when it was on television, I'm enjoying it all over again. I am, however, disappointed that the seasons are now coming as split seasons instead of the entire season. It's also taking much too long for the seasons to be released."
3,With preservatives,"3 1/2Cooker propelled this startlingly young trumpeter to the forefront of hard boppers, playing out in retrospect with slightly more charisma than various counterparts."
2,LaFemme Cake Mascara,"Actually, I bought this mascara for the brush. When I got it, it was a different brush - not the one pictured, but a standard mascara wand - so it kind of defeated the purpose! The mascara itself is fine."
1,Sustaining the Earth,"Environmental preservation is such an important subject that it should be presented in a manner that anyone can understand. This book burries the reader, with it's run-on sentances, with mind boggling fact after mind boggling fact. The grammar was so bad that it ultimately stunted my motivation for reading the text not more than half way through. I reccomend looking elsewhere in order to educate yourself on bio-eccological concerns."
1,Picture does not represent what you will receive!!,"OK - First major disappointment with AMAZON. After having received this I NOW understand that the picture of this product shows about thirty bristle discs and a steel mandrel! I had no idea I would receive - for $20 when shipping is included - five slim discs, that when laid atop one another are no more than 1/4"" thick! And no mandrel. Very disappointed. The description is unclear as well, and the mandrel cannot be found for sale at AMAZON."
5,Must-see documentary,"I saw this documentary at the Toronto ""Hot Docs"" documentary film festival. It is the best documentary I've ever seen. It is such an exposé into the world of diamond smuggling and corruption in Africa, but it is also darkly funny. You will be shocked while laughing at the same time, and shocked that you are laughing. Watch it!"
5,Oscar Worthy!,"An entertaining and daring insight into the real world of ""diplomacy"" in the remotest parts of Africa. Great story -- excellent filmmaking."
2,A Reprint of Part of a Very Old Collection of Translations,"This small paper reprint comes from a very old collection of translations that contained Gildas, Geoffrey, and Nennius with I believe a section of the Anglo Saxon Chronical. The Translation is rather poor and is from a manuscript inferior to that used for Nennius, History of the British, 1980. This manuscript unlike that used for Myres' edition does not contain the Annales Cambriae. The reason this version is the only one in circulation might be the lack of copywrite protection. Be warned this translation by Giles is not annotated in any way and is in an order not congruent with that cited in most Arthurian secondary literature--following up footnotes will be difficult. If you can get the 1980 translation from a university library or a very good public library, you can annotate this text and correct the the most glaring translation errors."
5,Key Document of Arthurian History,"Nennius has assembled and preserved some of the earliest accounts of British history in the dimly understood Fifth Century. Some of his sources consisted of earlier writings, and others oral traditions; many would otherwise be lost today. Every student of Dark Ages and early Medieval history should read this classic translation of Nennius's crucial work."
3,Eden:,"After seeing the band on TV, I thought Eden would be more instrumental. I didn't hear instruments featured until Track 5, and one other plus piano at the last. The singing was pretty, but I definitely wanted the violins."
5,Well Done,"Accurate description and reasonable delivery (very fast, considering ground shipping). Would buy from this seller again."
2,Disappointed,"I have to admit i am not very pleased with my purchase. I recently saw this ballet in my country, Turkey, and i liked it so much i wanted a copy of the Nutcracker. However, when i recieved this Slovakian copy, i realized the version i saw in Turkey was a renewed version and way more entertaining. The players in this show dance and act according to the original play written 150 years ago. Plus, the stage and decorations are appalling. There is no fairy coming out of the chimney or there is no christmas tree that is supposed to increase in size in mid-play. (becasue all the actors in the play are actually toys - duh!)Costumes and lighting is not so good either. In the Egypt scene, number of dancers is reduced from three to one. And what a hideous dancer that one is.In short, if you want to see the Nutcracker played good, this one is not it. Scout more and find a better copy. That is what i'll do."
4,Not too bad,"My three year old thinks that she wants to be a ballerina. We've been watching ballet scenes from Hans Christian Anderson over and over and over and... we (her parents) needed a little more variety. Okay, so this video doesn't star the top ballet dancers, but it does display the work of some aspiring young artists. This is a very economical way to introduce the world of ballet to a young girl who wants to be a ballerina today and a construction worker tomorrow."
2,You WILL fail if this is your only study source,"-Nothing on configuring Static Routes-Nothing on configuring Default Routes-Nothing on configuring OSPF-Nothing on OSPF Neighbor Discovery/Neighbor Relations-Nothing on OSPF Designated Router Election-No coverage of Spanning Tree commands-No coverage of NAT/PAT [Inside/Outside-Private/Public]-Utilizes the NativeOS 1900 commands; the exam objectives on cisco.com SPECIFICALLY state that the exam NO LONGER COVERS 1900 commands, but now has been updated to the 2950/3550 IOS syntax-Substandard coverage of Remote Access configurationAbout the only positive thing I can say about this book is that it would probably be enough for ONLY the 821 INTRO exam, BUT NOT sufficient for the 801 Comprehensive or 811 ICND."
1,"Bad, bad, and what was that other word, Oh yeah, BAD!!!","This book has a good part and a bad part. The first part of the book contains information that you should already know if you are studying to take the CCNA. The second part, the stuff that supposedly covers the CCNA material - SUCKS!!! And since this book is about earning the CCNA, I can not recommend it to anyone.I intended to use this book to go from the start to finish actually using a real Cisco router. The material is so chopped up and scattered through this book that you can't find anything actually helpful.I would recommend any other book other than this one. There has to be something better than this."
1,Jones - Barry & Ed Tittel Should BE ASHAMED OF THEMSELVES !,"B U Y E R B E W A R E !!!!This book is LOADED WITH FLAT OUT MISTAKES ! I just can't believe that a book could have this many MISTAKES! Practice Questions with the WRONG answers! Text with spelling and technical errors! Obviously this book never went through a Technical Review before publishing. It says ""Edited by Ed Tittel"" I think Ed was asleep when he edited this book! I have used the Exam Cram Books for A+, Network+ and they are on the money for someone like me that has experience and just wanted review. STAY AWAY FROM THIS ONE !"
2,5th printing's still a mess,"Passed CCNA 6 years ago and now need to recertify. Had really like Exam Cram 6 years ago so I ran out and bought the latest version. What a difference 6 years made in quality! There are so many errors in the practice tests I had to go through them all, fix the errors and then make another attempt. C'mon guys, the 5TH PRINTING! 2 CCNA's could have fixed all the errors. Have used Exam Cram in the past (up to 5 yrs ago) and they were good. Obviously, the rate at which they churn out these books has seriously affected their quality. And yes, I downloaded the errata. It only covers up to the 3rd printing. One more thing, the cd by PrepLogic only holds a ""demo"" version of the tests. Includes 1 55 question sample test and then asks you to go buy the others.I'm off to buy the Sybex CCNA book (Todd Lammle). I had this one 6 years ago and the reviews say its still really good."
1,Not a CCNA but a Intro To Networking Book,"I thought that this book might be something like a last minute revision before taking the test, more like cram-session as the name implies, but it is anything but that. The order of the chapters is way tooo weird. WAN protocols in Chapter 4 followed by TCP/IP and then switching and routing... WOW!! The author also goes into great details to explain things that arent required for a ""Exam Cram"", fails to provide any real examples and overall the material provided in the book is very trivial. This book is for someone who wants to learn a few basics about networking, NOT for someone who plans to tackle the CCNA.I recommend CCNA Fast Pass by Todd Lammle as a last minute revision ONLY after reading Cisco's CCNA Companion Guide (2 books) and Todd Lammle's CCNA Study Guide."
2,Used to be good,"I used to use the Exam Cram stuff all the time a few years ago and it always got me through the test. Thanks to this book, I finally failed one. There is no way there is enough detail to pass the 801 in here.The memorization sheet they include is crap. There were maybe 8 questions between both tests I took that were on that sheet.My example is the Advanced Routing Protocol section. The chapter in this book doesn't even cover 10% of what you need for the test. My suggestion is to look elsewhere until Exam Cram can find some better authors."
3,"*sigh* Failed the test...come on, Exam Cram 2!","I'll try to be fair. CCNA by Exam Cram 2 is a pretty good introduction to Cisco networking and WAN/routing network in general...but you should not rely on it to pass the CCNA exam.This book has many strengths and weaknesses. It does a wonderful job describing router hardware, WAN functionality, and routing protocols.However, this book fails miserably on the topics of IP addressing, subnetting, and CIDR. The bulk of the CCNA exam revolves around these topics. Additionally, the book could be better in the area dealing with router commands.The practice questions and the Prep Logic practice exam on the CD are useful.Your best best is to buy two other CCNA books from other publishers, and use the Exam Cram 2 as a supplementary text."
1,I failed because of this book!!!,"I made the mistake of trusting this book to prepare for the CCNA. The authors owe me $125.The outdated sections of the book should have given me a hint. I really got slammed on routing protocols during the testDO NO TRUST THIS BOOK. Alone, it is useless."
5,Daughter loves it!,"Our daughter, soon to be 5, recieves this magazine as a gift from her Grandma, and she loves it! She loves disney princess, and this magazine is great for her. There are usually several stories in comic book style that we read together, in addition to coloring pages, a full page poster, and some have come with a page of princess stickers. She always looks foward to it coming in the mail. We will definately renew it for her next year."
3,Pricey!,"And I am not talking about the subscription! My problem with this magzine is that there is SO much advertising in it - all from Disney. I know it's their magazine, so they're entitled to do it, but my daughter did (some of) the activities, and then treated it like a catalog - ""Mommy, can we get this?, Mommy - look at the movie coming out!"". We switched to Sparkle magazine which has NO advertising in it - just D.W., Angelina Ballerina, and other favorite girl characters. Yes, it's got all the Disney Princesses, but you may feel like the evil stepmother after having to say no to all the ""I want""s."
1,Destroys Her Credibility,"I agree with other reviewers that Myss's verbal abuse is inexcusable. Along with that, her arrogance and self-aggrandizement destroy her credibility as a spiritual leader. She overgeneralizes about the boomer generation in many ways. I also question her use of ""narcissism,"" though I think she illustrates the usual meaning of the word in the way she speaks here! Unlikely that I will ever listen to her or read her books again."
1,too much,i found this more like an upper level history/political science class - way over my head and very frustrating - full of references to things I'm not familiar with - hardly inspiring.
1,More condescension and verbal abuse from Ms. Myss,"After reading several of her books and listening to some of her audio tapes, I continue to ask myself, what is Caroline Myss's problem? Why is she so annoyed and who gives her the right to patronize and condescend to her readers and listeners as she so frequently does? If it is wisdom you are seeking, try anything by Jack Kornfield, Pema Chodron, or the wise and wonderful Dalai Lama who has said: ""My religion is kindness."" Myss might have some very interesting and helpful things to say, but that grating and annoying tone of voice diminishes whatever it is that she wants to convey."
1,Stop yelling at me and get to the point,"I was so disappointed in this CD. I felt like I was getting yelled at the entire time and I just kept waiting for her to get to something of substance. Setting the sarcasm and condesenstion aside, she spent most of the time ranting and babbling. I was determined to stick with the CDs, sure there had to be substance from the great Caroline Myss. She did finally get to some substance on the second CD track 11 but it certainly wasn't worth enduring the verbal abuse.Save your $ and find a more uplifting and instructive author."
3,your power to create,Caroline Myss is a gifted Medical Intuitive but I never realized how critical she is of other types of healing that she differs with. This bothered me in this recording.Dana Hardy
1,DON'T BUY,Don't waste your money. Ms Myss is rambling and incoherent. Ultimately the content of the CD has very little to do with the title.
5,Your Power to Create,"I have been following Caroline's work for about 10 years, and this was very good. She is so crystal clear in the way she teaches. She breaks it down so it's very digestable. I was very happy with my purchase."
1,Revolting Narcissistic Sad Little Person,"I made the huge mistake of wasting my time and money on this CD set. She has absolutely no clue regarding the 'law of attraction' and her judgmental, 'you are pathetic and I'm wonderful' attitude was enough to make ask for my money back. I thought of destroying the CD's because like watching a slasher film I don't think they're good for anyone but I simply don't want her receiving any royalties for the garbage she's handing out as truth. If you are interested in something uplifting and something that will teach you about ""Your Power To Create"" please look elsewhere."
1,I hated it!,"I've just listened to it, and it was awful. The tonality of her voice, the way she talks like the listener is an idiot, and lastly, there was absolutely no content that was worth remembering or writing down. Absolute drivel. As Simon would say ""That was horrible!"" I would really like my $19.95 back from Borders.What a waste of time and money. I way prefer Abraham Hicks. At least you don't feel like you're being ripped off, and you're actually give a method to follow."
1,I hope I don't get lynched!,"Where has her compassion gone? Maybe this is a great CD but I'll never know because after the 1st five minutes of ranting about some folk's misguided attempts at spirituality, I turned it way off. Cosmically off. Karmically off!! For the record, I thought I liked Caronline Myss a lot, I'm not having a bad day and life is pretty good. I was looking to make it better ... in the wrong place evidently!!:)"
3,Evil Abyss is not Ellis's greatest,"I've read all of the Outlanders saga, and found this one not up to par with the previous novel - Uluru Run. Even though that novel had its problems too, I found it more enthralling to read.Victor Milan is getting better and better with each successive novel he writes in BOTH series.Ellis, this was good, but not all that and a bucket of chicken. C'mon, you've done better than this!!The recent Successors, for example, was far more exciting to read than this one. Milan is rising up!"
5,"A warm, lyrical, and marvelous interpretation","For those who know Pierre Boulez's many recordings, ""warm"" and ""lyrical"" may not be the first two adjectives to spring to mind. The words are appropriate for this recording of Mahler's First Symphony, however. As in other Boulez recordings, the orchestration is transparent and the logic of the music clear. Here he has the advantage of conducting a superlative orchestra, the Chicago Symphony, one with outstanding first-chair players and a distinctive, powerful brass sound. Both these strengths are used to excellent effect in this performance. Though I'm a big fan of most of Mahler's later symphones -- nos. 2, 3, 4, 5, 9, and ""Das Lied von der Erde,"" I never warmed to Symphony #1 until hearing this performance. I am now a fan. Both the symphony and this performance are enchanting."
1,Clueless Meets Harry Potter,"Not only is the main character of this half baked story lost, but the author as well. What started out as a funny and interested story, quickly disintergrated into unimagnative silliness after the first 50 pages. The rickety witchcraft premise for this story have no power to transport or teleport the readers. Those who find the history of the Medieval period fascinating should stay away from this nonsense, better to read Michael Chricton's ""Timeline"". It has its problems too but nothing like this ""Errant Knight"", more like ""Errant Author""."
4,War of Roses Series,Before I read this I read the Outlander series which is a bit heavy but wonderful. This series was fun and engaging and a much easier read. I just wish the third book had more to follow.
3,Not bad but far from excellent,"Robin Stanford is on vacation in England when she is suddenly transported in Middle Ages and runs right into (and falls in love) with Edward Plantagenet. I know, I know-this sounds too stupid and improbable. However, to my surprise, I actually enjoyed most of it. Writer throws in some accurate historical facts to make it interesting, his description of what modern woman would think about Middle Ages, its customs, lack of technology, etc. is good and insightful. However, he runs out of steam towards the end and becomes somewhat boring."
1,Knight Errant,"The first few pages grab my attention however the story involved far too much historical information and description.This writer loses his reader by not bringing the hero back into the story almost at the end of the book after a long absence. The hero was the main reason I bought the book in the first place, he didn't reappear for almost three hundred pages later."
1,Knight Errant in more ways than one!,"After reading this book because it was written ""in the tradition of Diana Gabaldon's Outlander series,"" I am vastly disappointed. As an avid reader of historical fiction, this one was just silly. The heroine in this book was mindless, aimlessly babbeling on to anyone with no consequences as to how she may be perceived. Being accustomed to a lot of details in historical fiction, there was a lot missing from this book. Pairing actual persons to fictional ones is tricky when it's done well, but missed the mark here. I'm sad to say I wasted my money on the hardback book."
2,Too much fluff,"This book had a great idea, that never turned into something wonderful. I think if the author would have left out some of the dukes, earls and other so not important people and let the reader draw on thier own imagination, this book would have been much better. I cuouldn't keep track of who was who and, I really stopped caring. The characters were good, but they left alot lacking. It was something I read and almost had to force myself through it. Alot of the extra fluff should have been concentrated on the main characters. There was no real emotion. I like to expirience a book not just read whats infront of me."
5,Excellent Talent for a Great Fusion Band,"I've seen Coham around the same time this DVD was filmed and he is at his best on this DVD. His band members all originating from Europe, 2 from Germany and 1 from Amsterdam is extremely talented. Rita Marcotulli on key boards is one of the best female keyboardist I've ever heard. I was surprised to see Wolfgang Scmidt, who was originally the bassist for Passport (one of my favorite fusion bands) is on this DVD. He is a great bass player and shows some of his talents on Stratus. Peter Wolpl, guitarist who I am not very familiar with is great also. Nippy Noya, percussionist is very good also. If you are into fusion/jazz/funk you will love this DVD. My only drawback is that it is only in dolby stereo but the sound is good and the video is good also, better than Glass Menagerie which I also own."
3,Good drumming!,"Good product! loved it. Nice drumming for those who love the old school drumming.Love to get the blu ray, don't know if it is out there yet."
3,Route 66: Marathon Tour,Too many interviews and not enough scenery ! Would have liked vision from the moving vehicle and lengthy roadside sceens. We have missed out on the trip on this one! Robbo
1,Don't waste your money...,"I don't where to start on what is wrong with this. It is nothing but interviews -- many with a vested interest (restaurants, etc.) in gaining publicity. There are virtually no landscape shots or anything that tries to convey the excitement of traveling on this historic road. There is very little historical perspective (no old photos or movie footage incorporated). The tour itself is in an RV, which is a slap in the face of the history of this road. Read some of the highly rated books on Route 66 or drive it, but when it comes to this DVD set, take the bypass and avoid it altogether."
2,Not ENOUGH Route 66,"I am like the reviewer below, there is too much interviewing(and they go on and on and on)and not enough showing of the old route and the sights along the way. I can't believe they wasted a great opportunity to show Route 66 in Hi-Def. This was truly a disappointment!"
3,"Too many interviews, Not enough Route 66 !","This is a very professional, nice looking DVD. The only problem I have is there is too much time spent intereviewing folks along the way. In fact, I'd guess 75 to 85% of the time, we are seeing old timers talking about the good old days, instead of seeing Route 66, which is why I bought the DVD."
3,route 66 - marathon tour,- it's not completely what I expected.- too much talking and too less images of the road- i wouldn't really reccomend it as a guideline for Route 66
4,Not packaged well for shipping,"Took quite awhile for order to arrive and the tin is dented in several places...However, given the price of the item - I am very happy with this item and will make an excellent gift for my daughter & son-in-law..."
4,Nice nostalgia & history tour,Bought this for myself and father-in-law. We're both nostalgia buffs and found this to be very enjoyable. Very low price and many hours of enjoyment.
5,Boston Legal Season 1 DVD,"This show is seriously funny. I was never a big fan of either William Shatner or James Spader, but they make this series come to life. This show addresses some topics that have been in the news recently and in the past in the form of lawsuits and defending criminals. In the mix is a lot of humor. I would definitely recommend this DVD set to anyone who watches Boston Legal and may have missed the 1st season, or for anyone who is interested in the show."
5,What A Pleasure For The Well Informed/Laugh Out Loud Funny!!!,"This is as good as it gets. Humor Galore (James Bond Style), Up to the minute social issues with the real/reel FACTS!!! The acting is/not hollywooded, it is deadly funny bone serious. The issues they address are classic, in your face, can't believe the public is that stupid/THEY AREN'T. They speak to a audience that is AMERICAN to the bone."
3,Full Season?,"My understanding is that only 17 episodes will be on this DVD.You will see on most episode guides that 17 episodes were shown for Season 1. However 22 episodes were actually made but only 17 aired because of the success on Grey's Anatomy when it first in America. The final 5 episodes were shown at the start of Season 2 so they just appear to be Season 2 episodes. Some of the episodes were reworked so that it looks like the new cast members were part of this. If you look carefully, the new characters in Season 2 do not actually appear on screen with the old characters of Season 1 (Monica Potter, Rhona Mitra). In fact those leftover 5 episodes were so butchered that they were merged into 4 episodes. The episode ""Race to Ipsa"" actually has never aired.Anyway, it would have been nice to the DVD be released with either the full 22 episodes of Season 1 as intially made for television OR have the 17 episodes on the DVD with a 'bonus' 5 episodes in the special features section.AARON"
3,Boston Legal 1st season,"Boston Legal got better with every season. Season 1 had a rough start but it's still good, just not excellent."
4,All Hail Denny,"Hopefully as you read this the price is still right; picked up the first three seasons for 25 bucks a pop! Great to get the first two, since back then the ABC schedule was less dependable and I missed a lot of early episodes of the best lawyer show in the history of television."
3,quality of product,"The quality of the product was not very good thus it has some flaws when its played. For example, the disc is playing and the sound of the program suddenly goes down. other flaw is that it pauses its self once or twice, especially disc 2.Please advise."
1,Boston Legal - Season 1,"I planned to watch Season 1 of Boston Legal during some of my winter vacation (too cold to venture outside unnecessarily). Can you imagine my disappointment when I opened the DVD case of Disks 3&4 to find it EMPTY??!! Silly me -- I should have checked each case upon arrival. I've never had a problem with Amazon shipments, therefore I didn't find it necessary to go through each DVD case checking behind the packagers. Box and receipt were tossed shortly after receiving merchandise. Thanks alot Amazon!"
4,Boston Legal (Season One),"I love it. It is great, witty, and very entertaining. I have ordered two more srasons of Boston Legal."
5,I Did Not Want to Like This Show,"After The Practice went out and became so tired and this show was pegged to be a spinoff I had no intention of even watching, let alone liking it. It seemed like a showcase for actors past their prime. Put simply, I was wrong. It is a smartly written show and James Spader and William Shatner could not be better. That goes for the supporting cast, too. It is one of the few shows I look forward to each week. I dont know that it has the drama that the Practice had but its certainly more entertaining overall and easily one of the best shows on tv. It deserves any Emmy it gets."
5,Denny Crane!,I am a long time fan of this series. I was so glad to get the first season in my collection.
3,Great Characters; the show preaches too much,"I am giving this show 3 stars because of the marvelous acting given by James Spader, William Shattner, and the rest. However this show is far too preachy for my taste. To me I look for TV and movies as an outlet of escape from everyday life. One just needs to read the paper or watch the nightly news for what Boston Legal is attempting.Rather than a witty light hearted comedy that can throw a dramatic twist at you, David Kelly has chosen this show as an outlet for his poltical views and social preaching which is the shows downfall. Democrat or Republican, lets leave the preaching out of entertainment."
1,Court of the Absurd,"What started out as a good show evolved into a political forum for the far left. In addition, characters are routinely seen drinking tumblers of scotch. The office of this law firm would be 'gold mine' for AA."
5,Best show in recent memory,This show is a complete package: superb acting and writing. It's a joy to watch.
2,Good Seller Response,"Seller sent a PAL version of the dvds, which do not play on American dvd players. Seller replied immediately after I wrote him of this problem and was very eager to fix the problem. I got my money back to my c.c. and did not have to return the dvds."
5,Wonderfully clever and funny,"I absolutely love this show. Extremely funny, outrageously clever, and always on-point with issues that society is facing today. Absolutely a buy (great value too for the # of episodes you get). Grab season 2 as well so you can save on having to ship them seperately :) (you'll want the 2nd one after you watch the first)."
5,Best show currently on TV!,"I am a big fan of television, and if I say something is the ebst show on tv, that means it must really be good if you take into account the thre ehours of primetime i watch every night. Boston Legal is truly one of those shows in which the writing/directing/acting etc. is so good that you just can't stop thinking about it and can''t wait for the next installment."
4,For the first time I'll buy a dvd of a TV show,"What a joy is Boston Legal, the cast is a dream, the writing is superb. This show combines humor, drama, current events and a bit of lunacy. It's intelligent, quirky...highly entertaining and thought provoking. It is such a pleasure to see the gifted James Spader doing amazing work every week...and Candice Bergen is fantastic, as well as William Shatner."
5,"Awesome writing, fantastic actors.","Witty, smart and entertaining. Isn't that what it's for? Love this show, James Spader, William Shatner. Even the characters you don't like- you enjoy not liking them! Need the other seasons asap, Santa?"
3,A Shore hit,"I came by this series quite by chance on DVD, not knowing anything much about it - and was pleasantly surprised with the result.It's certainly not a great show like, say, the Sopranos, but it does hold its own when compared with the regular, run-of-the-mill TV fare that comes out of the U.S. entertainment factory.Scripting is pretty good on the whole, even if a little too dense for the running time available. Of particular merit is the character of Alan Shore, admirably played by the superb poker-faced James Spader. He is particularly well counterbalanced by William Shatner, whose dominating presence is impressive, considering the relatively small part he plays in the proceedings. The women are more like talking waxworks than real characters - but then Alan Shore is quite an act to follow.All in all, I got my money's worth for this DVD set, but I don't think my enthusiasm for the series will extend to buying season 2."
5,thank you Dr. Corduan,"If you're an atheist or anti-Christian with a blatant bias against anything and everything Christian--don't bother to read this book. You'll just have something else to rip apart and be disgusted with. If, however, you are honestly seeking to understand how ""God"" or a divine being of some sort can be rationally argued for, then you might want to take the time to read this. Dr. Corduan is a very humble, loving person who wants to promote understanding, belief in what many call IR-rational, and hopefully show that with honest doubt can come forth honest, REAL faith--not blind faith. So thanks Dr. Corduan and also Dr. Doug Groothuis (for using the book in class), its also helped my teenagers to understand their faith as well.Blessings to you."
1,Really boring to listen to.,"Again another album with unbelievable reviews. YGM has always regarded himself as a modern day Paganini, but even Paganini was never as repetitive as this. Uli Jon Roth is the king of this kind of 'orchestral music making', check out his recent 'Legends of Rock' album and you'll see what I'm talking about."
2,This CD is redundant,"I am a fairly avid Yngwie fan. I love his instrumentals, especially the concerto with the Czech orchestra. This recording with the Japanese orchestra is unnecessary because it sounds like a replica of the studio recording with minor differences. The main minor difference is poor quality recording. On some songs the volume swells. Some tracks are louder than others. Yngwie and the orchestra make rhythmic mistakes. Don't get this cd only for the extra encore tracks Blitzkrieg and Far Beyond the Sun. I imagine the DVD might be worth purchasing because there is novelty in seeing. C'mon, seeing yngwie shredding with an orchestra would look so cool. I really enjoy watching his fingers move. But, this CD provides no novelty compared to the Czech studio release. It's just worse quality. I highly discourage you from buying it."
3,For completists only...,"Made in JAP in 2002, Serial# PCCY-01551, Playing Time 73:27Recorded in Tokyo (probably at Bunkamura Orchard Hall on June 17,2001), this disc features Yngwie performing his ""Concerto..."" in its entirety, along with 4 other tracks accompanied with a Philharmonic Orchestra.Even though this performance is well recorded, one has to wonder if there's any interest in capturing this event (3 concerts were performed) for posterity on CD (and, believe it or not, a DVD also exists!)Somehow the studio version of this Concero didn't especially captivate me, and the live performance doesn't change my opinion (except that the acoustics are better in the studio!)If you're a completist of Yngwie, perhaps you can't resist; but if you're a ""regular"" fan (or a casual listener), wait and see if a North-American pressing will see the light of day..."
4,"Great designs, many uses",We recently used these for a neighborhood Halloween block party as stencils for face painting and they worked great! Kids and adults both were able to use them with ease.
5,Used on brownies.....,"Used these on brownie squares, and sprinkled powdered sugar on them... worked great! Was going to try cupcakes for tonight (Halloween) but plans changed. Thinking I'll do frosted cookies next year, and try colored sugar. I think that the larger ""jimmy"" type sprinkles would be more difficult and not as defined.I also plan on using these to stencil on some fabric or glass, using the proper types of paint of course."
4,This 3rd Person Shooter game Rocks!!!,This game has just came out today and i finally got my hands on it. I was so anxious to find out who the new character is and guess what ladies it is a girl..whoohooo. This game is filled with action and adventure..defintiely a Hack and slash!!!http://www.hunterthereckoning.com/wayward
3,Mindless Hack and Slash!,"I didn't quite know what to expect when I purchased this game however I did purchase this game used. If I had paid full price for this game I would've been very disappointed. There's nothing more than tedious hack and slash action. And character development is very limited. Once you discover the codes to the game, you'll pretty much tire of it very quickly!"
4,good game,The gameplay is fun especially if you play with someone else overall if you played the first game you will enjoy this one
4,"Extract from &#65533;Books on Bosnia&#65533;, London 1999","The editor develops the theme of `post-emotionalism' (as an alternative to post-modernism), by which he means `the culture industry's manipulation of emotionally charged historical events'. He contributes a stimulating essay on the Orwellian misrepresentation of the Bosnian war in the West, while other contributors range more widely. Especially valuable are the important analysis of the Serbian-Croatian war by Norman Cigar, and a searching study by Igor Primoratz of the way in which the war was misrepresented in Israel."
1,WOW! .... Was I surprised when this item arrived.,"I don't have much time at the moment ( It won't take long so here goes)... to report to you consumer's out there... you want the most for you money, but most importantly, also...is seeing what you are buying...before it arrives.This bed pan is nothing like what you see here in the picture...it is so small, has no divided area's...I was very mad...I'm returning this product as soon as possible.I was completely deceived...and this is for my very ill little girl, who needed this...I paid expedited fee's for this...and it serves NO purpose...entirely too small...wish this wasn't the case...beware...:(Disposable Bed Pans Gold Without Cover"
4,Frighteningly True.,"This is one of the better books that delves into the lives of real neo-nazis. The author takes you on a ride through his life growing up as a racist and it's hard to believe some of the things he has done. He also had the courage to change. While I don't condone these actions, this is a great book for anyone."
3,"Based on some, it's pretty good","Based on some other books I've read regarding the Neo-Nazi movement in modern day Germany, this one is pretty good. I have read some very in-depth books, including some not allowed to be published in Germany (too controversial). However, this books info stops in the early '90's, when the book was published. Though it accurate to its time, it is not very up-to-date regarding the present turmoil, and Neo-Nazi movement in Germany. The movement has advanced dramatically since this book was published. This book is very good in terms of the personal testimony of the former ""Ex-Fuhrer"", yet not very accurate of up-to-date activities and views held by the members of this movement."
4,A little repetitive,"The CD features some great remixes of one of my favorite Rammstein songs (du riechst so gut), but the CD gets a little repetitive (since its 8 versions of the same songs) On the other hand, it has the ""Du riechst so gut"" video for your computer so I think it is worth the price. It isn't Rammstein's greatest but, it's still Rammstein"
3,one song too few,"this cd kicks @$$ for only having one song, very exelent remixes by various groups like KMFDM and Faith no More."
5,Wonderful Al Martino Christmas album.,"This album is wonderful. His voice is so clear...you can understand what he is singing about. Not like the songs coming out now...(I call it 'noise'.) Anyway, you won't go wrong in buying this album. His music was great from the time he recorded 'Here In My Heart' until his last album titled 'Thank You' (for being my wife.) which can be purchased through his website. Just beautiful."
1,Bad Elevator Music,"I was looking for some kind of different approach to old favorites. For example, George Winston has an album where he plays (piano) Doors music, it's pretty good. This ""thing"" is awful. Lifeless renderings, bland upon bland. It's so bad that I've saved it for a ""fooler gift"" (funny gift) for next Christmas for my brother-in-law."
5,Another one in a long list of winners from Lansdowne!,"After fighting in the war and losing the sight in one of his eyes, Lord Stoneforth comes home to London to find his brother, Mr. Attenbury, near death from a wound inflicted during a duel. The duel was over a slur cast upon one Melody Harriman, whom Mr. Attenbury believes he loves. Our hero, Lord Stoneforth braves Almack's--without a ticket!--in order to meet Miss Harriman and convince her to come to his brother's sickbed. He doesn't plan on falling in love with her himself. Judith Lansdowne is **such** a delight to read. Her sweet stories are filled with lively characters we cannot help but love. In addition, we have three other love stories, comedy, adventure, and a delightful portrayal of Lady Jersey! Judith Lansdowne has what I consider to be one of the really unique voices in Regency romance today. Dare I call it magical? I do. Rosemary Stevens"
4,heartwarming regency spoof,"Ms. Lansdowne leads us a merry chase into a regency love story - actually, four regency love stories. Four love stories in 256 pages is a bit over the top, but everything in this delightful spoof is a bit over the top. Ms. Lansdowne has complete command of her period, and proceeds to demolish everything from Almack's to the quizzing glass in this amusing and heartwarming romp."
2,Poor instructions,"One of the reasons I purchased this battery from this vendor was that it said it came with installation instructions. It did, but they were not good instructions. They needed more detail."
4,works great!,"did just as I expected it would. entry holes a little small, but I modified them by cutting another segment. highly reccommend this item."
5,One of the Best!,"Listening to each song, I became more and more impressed. Easily one of the best albums of the year (to date -- younger brother John Michael's album should be great) ""Lonely and Gone"" will be the SMASH hit off this album."
5,The Ultimate Log,"This is the most versatile and comprehnsive training log on the market. I've used many over the past 25 years and none offered the flexibility to adequately record the variety of information this log allows, heart rate data, routes, cross training, weather, emotions etc. A beautifully orgainized and easy to use, this log takes the grand prize with no others challeging for its place at the top. Wonderful advice is provided by true experts in the field of exercise physiology and training along with easy to use planning charts. This log does more than just record, it allows for review, planning and preparation. Way to go Richard and Dennis, this is a long needed item for every endurance athletes bag."
2,Too picturesque...large...,"While I can understand the appeal some runners have towards this running log, I personally found it too picturesque with a lot of fluffy details. It is too loaded with other stuff that I think shouldn't be in a log book like all those pictures and quotes. Of course, I guess different people think differently in terms of what makes a good log book. For me, a good logbook is one that is minimalist on the pictures (none the better) and quotes and mainly with space to write down the interval training, long distance runs, pace, heart rate etc. that are essential in a log book.And the other thing about this book is that it's format is too huge. Half the size would be good."
3,Not what it says,"While this training log is a pretty decent one, the ""product description"" for this item is incorrect. It specifically says that it includes ""full color photographs,"" and it does not. The only ""full color photograph"" in the log is the cover. I was disappointed upon receiving it."
3,Afraid to think?,"As a devout christian, this movie was, at times, a bit tough to take. I think that's why I liked it. Nothing ground breaking here, just a powerful script about the human condition. This film will make anyone (atheist or Christian, Muslim, Budhist, etc.) think deeply about how there spiritual beliefs fit into their wordly beliefs, without explicitly commenting on either. A touch of superb acting doesn't hurt."
4,It's not a movie.,"The Big Kahuna is not a movie. It's feels more like a filmed play, and as such it stays in one room the whole time. This format is a true measure of the quality of the screenplay because there are no special effects (or ANY effects for that matter) to distract you from the quality or inadequacy of the script. While not perfect, I thought it was extremely good."
2,"Good try, but no sale","What is it with Kevin Spacey and food? First he went gloriously ballistic with a plate of asparagus during his Oscar-winning performance in American Beauty, and now, in The Big Kahuna, he launches into a raging fit over canapés. Holding up a carrot stick, Spacey snarls, ""You call this hors d'oeuvres?""Spacey plays a salesman who, along with two colleagues (DeVito and Facinelli), is holed up in a hospitality suite in a hotel in Wichita, Kans., while waiting to sweet-talk prospective customers (big kahunas) into buying his firm's industrial lubricants. Despite showy performances by all three actors, this talky drama about the lives and lies of businessmen never transcends its static, stage-bound roots."
5,One of the best movies ever made!,For a movie that basically takes place in a hotel room the entire time this movie is great in every since of the word. I can relate to each of the three characters in this movie especially Kevin and Danny's roles.
4,The Big Kahuna,"I found this movie interesting to watch, but was not really smitten by it; it basically takes place in a hotel suite during an industrial lubricants convention; the three protagonists have three distinctive characters, and essentially the movie is about the three hashing out their differences while at the same time trying to devise a way of getting in contact with the ""big kahuna"" of the industrial lubricants industry; I believe this movie is based on a stage play and it certainly has that kind of feel, so this is definitely not the type of movie that will appeal to everyone."
4,A Big Suprise- Maybe the best movie of 2000!,"This movie is good. Watch it and take notes. Much thanks to Mr. Spacey for helping this story to get filmed (He was co-producer i believe). Much thanks to HBO for airing this film which I would've probably never seen had they not aired it. You would've figured that this movie would have had a chance at reaching an audience being that it was released just weeks after Spacey had won the Oscar. But sadly, people aren't used to 90 minutes+ of 3 guys talking in a hotel. This movie could possibly go out of print and virtually disappear due to lack of exposure. Danny Devito and Kevin are great together. Maybe in the future they could pair up again, make another 4 star movie, and show everyone what they were missing with this movie."
3,Wasted talent,"Kevin Spacey and Danny DeVito are A-class actors who exercised their talents in this movie. The plot is very weak.DeVito's character opines ""the world will spin without you"" which summarizes this film."
2,Notta Fan,"Soooooooooooo this entire film almost is completely exclusive to Devito, Spacey and Peter having discussion(s). And the rating? That is Exclusively for 3 or 8 f'words. wOw. Maybe I will one day see the brilliance I am at present missing. Glad this was an Instant Vid vs Purchased Flick. Not for Me."
3,Good,We will use this as opening for our Vacation Bible School this year. The animation is simple but the info is good.
3,BEECHAM HAYDN LOVER,"What attracted me initually to this release was the fact that EMI boasts this release as being completely stereo.I thought,could this really be?The original LP release of Symphonies 93-98 were in Mono,as was the CD release by EMI some years back in the ""Beecham Edition"".I own the LP set,so I was able to do an A-B comparison.Lo and behold,the new edition is still in mono in those first six symphonies.I also found the sound to befar superior on the LP's.Shame on EMI for not being up front that this isnot a complete stereo set!I shall stick with those fabulous sounding Capitol LP's and shall promptly sell this set!!!"
1,"Badly Made, Poor Design.","I was looking for this type of mirror for ages and bought this one. Subsequently I found a Homedics cheaper (at Wal-Mart) and wish I had bought that. This item was poorly made, the mirror was terrible and the chrome surround was loose and sharp edges were easily found. The mirror did not stay in position and after a month, I gave up using it and gave it to my friend."
3,"NO SURPRISES, HERE ... AND THAT'S THE PROBLEM","Brendel's Beethoven on these discs is, as always, clear and punchy, and the VPO plays with its usual luster. But that's what's wrong with this recording: It's a very ""usual"" reading, without surprise or daring. For a more dramatic, more evokative treatment, try Ashkenazy's set with The Cleveland Orchestra (Decca/London). You'll get more adventurous pianism, more spirited orchestral playing, and more spacious digital sound, all at the same price. (If you don't mind an analogue recording, Fleisher/Szell on Sony remains, of course, the universal benchmark.)"
3,One More Thing,I just looked at the price of this set and it's not at all that much lower than the Concertos set on Deutsche Grammophon's Complete Beethoven Edition.BY ALL MEANS GET THE GRAMMOPHON CD! You get 5 cd's with A LOT more stuff on them than these cds---and ALL FIVE Piano Concertos are SUPERIOR to the ones here.In classical- you get what you pay for. GO WITH THE BEST!
3,Disappointing,"As an avid fan of serial killer tales, I have read some very poor efforts at suspense. While this book is not absolutely dreadful, it was a bit of a disappointment.The character of Ben Stack is a cliche among suspense novels: hardened, tough, and estranged from his wife. Detective Rica Lopez does display some creative insights as a character but was left underdeveloped throughout the book. Also, Lutz describes her office behavior as, well, slutty.The adversary the NYPD cops are tracking down, is the Torcher. A mad, pyromaniac who delights in tying people up and setting them ablaze. Right from the start, it's apparent this killer is following some sort of agenda, but due to the constant backstories and time-changing, it becomes a complicated mess. The one red herring is drawn out relentlessly by the author. While the ending was a suprise and did provide an exlamatory,""No Way!"" that wasn't enough to rescue the rest of the book from mere mediocrity."
3,Okay follow-up,"This is Kid Sensation's second album. ""Rollin' with Number 1"" (1990 release) was a much better sounding album over all compared to his okay follow-up ""Power of Rhyme"". I believe Rower of Rhyme was released in '91 or '92. Most of the album sounds like K.S was clowning' around. This at times is okay.I had this on tape when it first came out and recently bought it on CD (both are now OOP). I was surprised to find out it came with additional songs not released on tape.Since I am from the Northwest I have love for Kid, E-Dawg, and or course Mix-A-Lot who sadly is missing for this album.This is far from a masterpiece. It is okay? I would say ""yes""."
5,best buy,"my mother gave me some of these from her wedding gift when I first set up house.....I am still using them and not only that, they are by far my favorite to cook in.....I have purchased others but nothing beats the revereware with copper bottoms for the money....my son recently got his first apartment and I purchased this set for him..btw...amazon has the best price!"
3,"The other reviewers are right, not Mom's cookware!","Can't say much here that hasn't been said. I got a great price on it ($49.99) so I really can't complain much.Not nearly as heavy as I remember though the fry pans are sturdier than the pots. The big pot however is the thinnest and burns inside pretty easily. I still haven't gotten out slightly burned onions residue!I needed pots and pans and the price was right...couldn't afford the best so I got what I paid for. Not bad but not the ones my mom had!----------------------------------------------------Now many months later, I wish I had purchased another brand...I have permanent damage in two of the pots from just a little suck on food one night. The frying pans are awesome though...work great!"
5,Indestructable Revere Ware,"Awesome product, my mom has had Revere Ware pots and pans since I can remember and she's never had to replace them."
5,feel the soul of Spain...,"Whether you have traveled in Spain or not (I suggest you do), this music will fill your spirit with images of majestic coastlines, whitewashed towns against green hills, and castles, while now empty, standing as sentinels throughout the country, from the plains to the mountaneous regions. The feel of Spain is here. The soul is inviting. Don't pass any more time without this music."
5,great ..why didnt i think of this,"this is a great way of learning and i wish i had seen this book when i was younger so i would not have been struggling with vocabulary words..but after i got this book, within a few hours i have memories at least 20 words and it stuck in my head this time..great book hope they come out with more."
5,Rare find!,"This is a collection of rare performances that you won't find anywhere else. It features some great performances by artists like Tina Turner, Gladys Knight, Marie Osmond, and Isaac Hayes. Check it out."
1,what a rip off,"i purchased this game and should have know for 1.79 there would be a catch. i put in the CD expecting to play Mahjongg but instead got classical music this was supposed to be a new game the cd said mahjongg, so some one appears to be copying cds and selling as new. returned the item waiting for my refund what a rip off"
3,At best a mediocre book about an important topic.,"As a long time software developer and Business Week subscriber, I succumbed to an assumption of quality based on the publisher and the book jacket endorsement by Eric Hahn. I was sorely disappointed.I found the book to be a casually written, sloppily edited (an egregious example being a reference to the trademark Nike ""Swish"", rather than ""Swoosh"") collection of psycho- and business- babble filled with self-aggrandizing name-dropping.Though some of the descriptions of organizations and their modes of collaboration were interesting, and some individuals quoted had useful things to say, the overall book left me with the feeling that it was hurriedly pushed out the door to try to take advantage of a growing interest in more effective multi-group collaboration. At best, a mediocre work."
4,Insightful!,"Robert Hargrove presents a well-organized look at the world of creative collaboration. He argues that collaboration is the new paradigm in a world of change and complexity, as well as an effective management strategy. Hargrove provides a hands-on guide to becoming more collaborative and to organizing effective collaborative groups. In this lively, engaging book, Hargrove shows his familiarity with the latest management expertise. He draws on quotes and ideas from such authors as Margaret Wheatley, Peter Senge and Tom Peters. We [...] recommend this book to executives and managers who wish to facilitate collaborations."
2,ROC Review - Misleading Picture and Description,Retinol Correxion (Roc) Deep Wrinkle Daily Moisturizer Cream - 2/1 fl. oz. Spf 30I will not buy from this seller again. The packaging picture and description compared with what I got were not the same. I got 2 separate packages of the item and not the combo pack which should have had the sunscreen tube as well. Feels like the old bait and switch game. Not happy. Don't waste your time with this.
1,Not worth the money,"Annoying loud music. When the tape was ended, I just wanted a cigarette. No stress on nosmoking. Sorry."
2,Huge potential wasted,"Only gave this 2 stars because of the music. This movie was light on everything.. sex, blood, suspense, etc... The media attention and good reviews are either from die-hard Zombie fans or people with low expectations. I can recall people who were squeamish about watching it because it might be too extreme. What a joke!"
1,The horror!!,"I'll get right to it: I found the script clunky and awkward, the acting over-the-top, and the gore factor pretty lame, considering all the blood n' guts promised in the trailers and critics' reviews. It just seemed like Rob and company were trying too hard to be edgy, without any real concern for actually crafting the story (which had tremendous potential that might have been realized in more capable hands). And yes, I'm a ""real"" horror fan."
2,Over the top,"This movie is based on the chainsaw massacre film, however it is not as scary. Overall it reminds me of a cheesy tale from the cript episode."
2,what a disappointment,this movie really was just a tribute to a bunch of different movies without being it's own. nothing too original in it at all. save your money and buy conquest by lucio fulci instead.
5,scariest movie I have ever seen,"This movie scared the piss out of me. I watched it tonight, and it made my skin crawl the whole way through it. Now it's four in the morning, and I have no intention of falling asleep. Dr. Satan is the most original character ever. Corpses has no boundaries and doesn't draw the line for anything. I feel like I saw the most vulgar, the most vile and most importantly-- the most scary movie I have ever seen. I won't be watching it again because I am too much of a wuss, but if you like to be too scared to go to the bathroom after a horror flick, then this is the movie for you. This movie absolutely deserves the term, ""horror flick."""
1,yawwwn,unless you're enthralled by marilyn manson videos then you'll probably not like this film. i have never been so bored. it wasn't funny. it wasn't stylish. it wasn't scary. it wasn't at all intelligent. it felt like a behind-the-scenes of a extra white trash haunted hayride (only totally un-funny). it wasn't even gross. it was so boring i think i'm going to barf. then i'm going to sell my copy of this movie.
1,one of the worst movies ever,"This movie doesn't even deserve 1 star. I was so excited about seeing it in the theater. I'm a big Rob Zombie fan, so of course I had to see it. I must say, I was extremely disappointd. It was pretty much the worst movie I've ever seen. I don't think those ""actors"" even had a script. It was your typical B movie and I'm sorry I wasted my money."
1,TERRIBLE HORROR FILM,"TWO YOUNG COUPLES TAKE A MISGUIDED TOUR ON THE BACKROADS IN SEARCH OF A LEGEND NAMED DR. SATAN. WHEN THEY ARE LOST, THEY TURN TO A FAMILY OF PSYCHOS FOR HELP. ABSOLUTELY THE WORST HORROR FILM TO HAVE BEEN RELEASED IN QUITE SOME TIME. THE SPECIAL EFFECTS ARE OVERDONE AND THE PLOT SOUNDS A LITTLE BIT TOO SIMILAR TO ''THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE''. ROB ZOMBIE'S MUSIC MAY BE ENTERTAINING, BUT THIS MOVIE DEFINITELY IS NOT. I FEEL SORRY FOR ANYONE WHO MAY HAVE BOUGHT THIS PIECE OF SH-T. IT'S A WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY."
1,Genre still dead,"You know better than to expect anything actually scary. What you want is disturbing gore. Hopeing for it, you tune out the insipid, painfully annoying dialog. Tune out the loud, heavy beat music that puts you in the safety of a music video. Tune out the high schooler hack direction. And you get... a couple ugly faces and No real violence. Sad little squibs? Yes. To say Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 is a hundred fold better movie, makes TCM2 sound better than it is."
1,All I can say is........,"I waited 2 and ahalf years of this piece of garbage.It was nothing what I thought it would be.When the DVD comes out I might try to see it again,if there's a unrated version on the disk.Not scary and not even as gory as I hoped it would be.Don't waste your time and your money.But I still think Rob Zombie rocks!"
1,Waste of money!,What a suck-fest. We left the theater twenty minutes into the movie...need I say more?
2,Ehhh...,"Now this movie wasn't exactly horrible, and I could've enjoyed it more if the ending hadn't been so bad. (Spoiler) I wanted the last character to make it out so bad, and it led me to believe she actually would... but Rob had to go with the stupid cliche ending that totally ruined my respect for the plot. (End spoiler) He does a good job of creating a sadistic family, and the first half hour is good, but from there it's just a bunch of death/torture scenes. I couldn't stand how the characters did practically nothing to help themselves besides the last girl. The two police officers were complete morons. They basically lined up for their deaths. I know this wasn't made to be an awesome movie, and it shows. It is half-decent. There was something about it I liked, probably because I felt for the characters... but I honestly feel watching this movie has made me less humane. If you aren't a fan of Rob Zombie or you're unsure at all, please don't see this movie. And keep it away from kids too."
4,"fun, if you like this sort of thing","This is a lovingly crafted homage to seventies-era horror flicks such as ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre,"" and writer/director Rob Zombie summons up that era fairly well. Still, it's a film composed more of brilliant pieces than it is a cohesive whole. The movie definitely runs out of steam toward the end, becoming merely weird when it most needs to be scary. That complaint aside, it's good stuff for horror buffs, and at least two of the characters -- Captain Spaulding and Otis -- will be quoted by fans for many a year. All the acting is effective, and the cinematography and editing are well-done.Regarding the DVD, the menus feature new character bits with Captain Spaulding, Otis, and Baby, and are very much worth checking out. Other special features include an enjoyable commentary by Zombie."
3,Not sure...,"So I start watching this and I am really bored for the first half of the movie. Then it actually starts picking up my interest. Ok, I had a problem with that annoying and grating on the nerves guy that sold chicken and had the freak show ride. The ride was really cool though when they finally got to it. When the kids leave his place and go in search of Dr. Satan and pick up the hichhiker, it picks up a lot. It seemed like it took forever, but it starts getting better. This movie was awesomelly filmed at the end too. The camera angles on faces were some of the finest I've ever seen and totally saved the movie. Too bad more than half of the beginning was so dull. On the extras on Sherri Moon's comments on stabbing and stuff, I really appreciated what she said. Her performance was so creepy and real I was beginning to wonder... Its not real its not real its not real..."
4,The Next Cult Classic?,"I personally loved this movie and had a great time watching it. It's totally twisted and sick, the characters are unusual and grotesque, and the ending is not your ""typical"" horror ending. Rob Zombie did a great job expressing his love and appreciation for horror films. Word of Caution, this is not your typical ""hollywood"" type horror. You may either like it or not.......Simple as that! I feel this will be the next cult classic because of it's oddity."
1,Snorting Excreatment Dust,"If I puked on the street 1000 times, made some hot chick roll around in it, recored it, spliced it together and put it on to video I would have made a better film than this.I wonder if Rob Zombie actually thought that what he was doing was good or worthy of watching. I could have spent the 2 hours I wasted on this movie with my nose caught in a large man's behinde, who hadn't showered for a week, and it mabey, by a hair, House of A Thousand Corpses would have had some redeaming qualities.If you liked this movie...well, I bet you are really, fat, ugly, or stupid, most likely all three."
1,Worst Movie Ever,"This was, without a doubt, the worst movie i have ever seen. Poor acting, poor directing, porr producing.....just poor all around. Not scary at all, in fact we laughed at the horrible effects more than we were scared at them. Unimpressed on the whole. Come again next year, Mr. Zombie."
1,Rob Zombie's poor rip-off of Texas Chainsaw Massacre,"Rob Zombie's awful horror movie stinks,no original plot thought by Rob Zombie he only copies Texas Chainsaw massacre,Last house on the left,and Motel hell,the maniacs include Captain Spaulding{Sid Haig}a clown,Mother Firefly{Karen Black} a blonde version of Sharon Osbourne,Otis{Bill Mosley,that also starred in Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 as Chpo Top the maniac} a maniac},Granpa Hugo,a cranky granpa,Sheri moon,a mean girl,and Tiny,her unbalanced brother.Lots of gore and stupid violence.Just Awful"
1,Yuck.,"This movie was, in a word, horrible.The acting was nonexistant. The plot made no sense. It was baisically a bunch of random events linked together with some really gruesome images. When you're not being bored or frustrated with the complete idiocy of this thing, you'll be disturbed by the pointless cruelty.In trying to do an artsy remake of the classic horror film, it fails miserably. In its dizzying effort to be artsy as possible, it ends up being complete and utter trash. Don't waste your money on this pathetic excuse for a movie."
3,House of 1000 corpses,"Utterly pathetic!!! I rented this movie expectng a gorefest and all i got was a cheap ... knock off of Texas chainsaw (which was like 1,000 times better!). There is little good i can say about this movie, except for I liked the opening credits, that was about the only origional thing about the movie... and i did laugh pretty hard when they skined that chick's father...that was pretty good. One thing that really [ticked] me off was the lack of gore that everybody was raving about. This movie is not that violent at all. Maybe if your like, the type of person that gets queasy over the site of blood.. uuhh...yeah. This movie really [stinks].. rock stars need to quit trying to make horror movies..Anyone ever see ""Strange Land"" by DeeSnyder? Its that bad too.. So, if you wanna see a really good shocker movie, try ""The cook the thief his wife & her lover"", or ""Mothers day"".soo... yeah, im just glad i didnt pay with my money to see this pathetic excuse for a horror movie!"
1,didnt really hold together,"i think i liked about 15 seconds of this film. the rest didnt live up to the influences. it looked nice. zombie has a good eye. i dont get his dramatic and story telling choices. im tempted to say he sux, but perhaps we have dif taste."
2,Not up to Par,"I couldn't wait to see this movie. Knowing that it was a creation of Rob Zombie's I had the highest of hopes for it. It fell very short of those hopes. It started off decent and definitely creepy, then went so far off the path it wasn't funny. We go from serial killers to cyborgs? What was Rob Zombie thinking? I love horror films, but this one was a HUGE waste of my time."
4,FUN HORROR MOVIE,"HOUSE OF THE 1000 CORPSES IS ROB ZOMBIE?S FIRST MOVIE AND ITS GOOD, ITS LIKE AN HOMAGE TO THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE ITS ALMOST THE SAME PLOT YOUNG KIDS IN THE 70?S LOST IN THE COUNTRY AND A FAMILY OF MAD PEOPLE GETS THEM AND KILLS THEM BRUTALLY IN AN ED GEIN?S TYPE OF HOME, THE VILLANS ARE VERY GOOD VERY CHARISMATIC CHARACTERS I LIKE THEM A LOT THANK GOD FOR ""THE DEVILS REJECTS"" THAT CONTINUES THE STORY AND GIVES AN END TO THE STORY. SO IF YOU LIKE HORROR FUN MOMENTS AND VERY CHARISMATIC CHARACTERS HOUSE OF THE 1000 CORPSES IS A VERY FUN RIDE. I KNOW I GOT A LOT OF FUN."
3,Indianapolis,"The DVD skips and is not in as good of shape as I had hoped. Can't really watch it because its annoying when it skips. Totally stopped playing at one point. You can kind of see through the disk itself, if that makes sense."
3,Like the movie BUT,"I enjoyed the DVD of this title very much.Unlike many people I talk to, I thought it was a great ride.BUT....I am guessing it wasn't Robs choice to remove the Sid Haig menu intro from the bluray version (which is probably the most talked about part of the film)I recieved the bluray today and was very disappointed to see that his hilarious intro was removed from this version.BUMMER!"
2,Standard,"house is a standard horror movie. These movies are formulaic, and Rob Zombie movie follows the formula. It's like Texas Chainsaw Massacre (the old one), just with more gore. It's not scary or frightening, just disturbing. Zombie's direction and angles are the best part of the film."
4,It was really good for what it was,"Like the one guy said, it's a B style horror movie. Don't expect more. For what it was, I actually think it was really good. And if some of you could stop being so dramatic: ""I can't believe this recieved an R rating!"" Oh yeah and the word genra in your little critique is genre. Just thought you should know since you used the word to make yourself sound knowledgable. lol. Alright anyways, back to the movie. It was really good. It had that back woods feel that is really scary like Deliverance or Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Oh what's that.....these two movies are B style movies and not another teeny bopper scary movie like Scream, or I Still Know What You Might Do The Summer After Next....for christ sakes people get over it. It was original and really good for what it was."
4,ooooh...that was scary,"If you are anything like me, and let's hopw for your sake that you are not, Horror movies lost their ability to shock somewhere around the 6th grade. However, there are some elements of this film that just stick with you, worm their way into your brain, and stay there for awhile. The thing that sets this movie apart from other slash-N-Hack T+A shock fests is tone and suspense. Of course we are not talking ""Citizen Kane"" here, but the cinematography is spooky and even though it looks like the final editing was done by a Benny Hana chef, it's not as annoying as it could be. It's almost attractive in a ""Natural Born Killers"" way. Anyway, I see no reason why you should not buy it when it comes out on the twelfth. I'll be waiting for it."
1,Searching For Meaning,"I think we are passed the stage in film making when shock films took the box offices by their suspenders, so to speak. I would love to hear what Rob Zombie has to say about the engenderment of this movie? What is the point? I watched this film twice, both times searching for some trace of meaning or poignancy, some hint at a reason for the production of this movie. I could not. The gratuitous (or not gratuitous, depending on your point of view) violence seems totally devoid of a purpose other than that cliched ""no purpose"" sentiment. There could be some semblance of a shot directed at the pathetic and insignificant serial killers that have ""plagued"" our society; however, they are mentioned only briefly and given cursory descriptions and quickly loose any effect that they might have had.The movie seems trite and banal-i don't know what else to say."
1,What The Hell?,"This movie was pure redneck horror trash.....ok maybe I'm being a bit hard on this movie but Rob you really let me down on thise one....It really took you that long to make this crap???? and all that time for what, nothing original, I mean the movie borrowed from everything from the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre to Natural Born Killer type cinematics.... pluse all those cheesy flash backs made for a realy ...annoying movie. I gave it one star cuz it was more cheesy and disgusting than even close to the scary horror movie I was expecting."
1,Lame Poser of a B movie,"Rob Zombie imitates gory B level, drive-in horror movies, but doesn't bring anything new to ""Corpses"". This movie is a big disappointment about 15 minutes in, which is oddly when the killers show up. If you are looking for a good gory horror movie, skip this one and go to what Rob Zombie is trying to copy: ""Motel Hell"", ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"", or even a ""Blood Sucking Freaks"". Don't settle for a fake."
1,sick,"don't get me wrong, i love horror movies, i don't mind blood or gore or insane/crazy plots but this movie was just SICK. there is NO other word for it...i don't understand how anyone could like this movie...stupid and SICK"
4,Zombie did a good job considering what he was aiming for.,"One thing people don't seem to realize about this movie is that Zombie's goal was to make this movie like the original horror movies of the 70's, especially Texas Chainsaw Massacre. If you pay attention you will notice that everything in the movie points to the 70's era cloths, cars, verbal conversations, etc. His brilliant use of negatives and odd camerea angles add to the tension in the movie. The music choices are from an odd selection including some of Zombies work and even the Ramones. If you like the Texas Chainsaw Massacre then you will like this."
4,A Morbid Journey of Brutality,"I have one question to those who thought this movie was terrible - What did you expect? Shock rocker Rob Zombie has created a stylistic homage to films like The Texas Chainsaw Massacre as he turns the sadistic brutality dial up a notch.The plot was actually better than I expected. Four 20-somethings come upon a store that sells Gas, Food and Murder. Upon hearing of the local urban legend of Dr Satan, who performed grizly experiments on his patients, they decide to do some research on the subject. Bad mistake.This movie is sick and disgusting and almost makes you feel dirty after viewing it. In other words, Zombie succeeds in doing what he intended to do(Disturb you)."
3,What?...reminds you of 'Texas'?...say it ain't so!,"I love the irony ...""not enough gore"", ""not as good as 'Texas Chainsaw Massacre'"". Well if gore gets your rocks off, this is a hell of a lot more gory than 'Texas', which was crafted to aim for a PG rating. Look at 'Texas' again, and quit whining about lack of gore. If you like 'Re-Animator', you'll probably like this if you haven't somehow turned stupid."
5,excellent movie,"all types of weirdos in this movie from pretty girls, to giants and in between. it somewhat like the chainsaw massacres."
1,Sucked Big Time,To D Harper Gardner Jr: The FCC (Federal Communications Commission) Doesn't rate movies and never did the MPAA (Motion Picture Association of America) does. As for this movie....I think Poltergeist has more gore and is scarier.
5,Great!,"This is truly one of the best horror movies I have seen. It has great music. The acting however isn't Oscar winning performances. The soundtrack has a lot of great music and some new songs by Rob Zombie. It is Rob Zombie's directorial debut, and its a great one!"
1,Goresexastupid,"I had to invent a new word to describe how mindnumbingly stupid this movie was. Everything was gratutitous. Not scary, not funny, nothing. Pop it in at a party if you want everyone out of the TV room."
1,Complete unwatchable garbage,"I'll try and keep this review short because I don't have much to say about this movie. 'House of 1000 Corpses' was by far the worst piece of garbage I have ever seen in my life. The plot was pure nonsense even for the horror genre and the acting amongst the entire cast lacked any convincing. Everything about this movie seemed cliche and done-before, including the costumes, the makeup, the scenery, and the childish jokes thrown in every now and then. What a shame that this project was hyped to become one of the most ground-breaking films of its genre. If you want to see horror films with some class, I recommend 'The Exorcist', George Romero's 'Night of the Living Dead', Bram Stoker's 'Dracula', the original black & white version of 'House on Haunted Hill', or Hitchcock's 'Psycho'.>>> 0 stars. A rundown of how I rated this movie:Acting: DPlot: FCinematography: FSet Design: COriginality: FRepeat Playability: F- the enlightened one"
5,Great condition,My movie delivered in just a few days as expected . The cover and movie it's self was in great condition not one issue. Very pleased and will be buying several more movies.
1,Wish it was better,When I got this movie it looked decent. When I looked at the case it was cracked and the DVD was scratched up a little. I played the movie and 10-20 minutes in it froze and skipped past a half hour of the movie.
5,Zombie Masterpiece,"I have waited nearly 2 years to finally see this movie, and the wait was well worth it. Rob Zombie is a genius, not only in the realm of music, but in the the cinematic realm as well. His decision not to stray from his original version makes this one to see. Who knows what would have happened if he had given in to the critics previously, and cut out certain parts. This is not just a movie, but a work of art in the twisted world of Zombie. From start to finish, it keeps you wanting to see more death. As I said previously, it's definately one to see...at least once. I know I will be adding this to my collection as soon as it is available on DVD."
1,Rob! What were you thinking?,This movie was terrible! I'm so disappointed in Rob Zombie (the whole reason I purchased this DVD). It's all over the place and the plot....what's the point. Please save your money.
1,"""House of 1000 Corpses"" stunk in 1000 ways","Boy was this film a letdown.Great trailers really made me want to see this film but what a stinker it turned out to be.Poor Rob Zombie really ,really, really wanted to make ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"".So we have an old creepy farmhouse,complete with things hanging from strings,chicken in a cage and even a misshappen freak running around in a mask.This freak is a part of a weird wacked out family complete with a senile grandpa and it even takes place in the 70's with a carload of teens looking for proof of the story of a Dr.Satan in some little hick town.Butchery , mayhem and a garbled story ensue.Zombie throws in the legends of Albert Fish and Ed Gein along with the story of Dr.Satan and our freaky family creating a jumbled crap pile of boogermen all meant to freak us out like Leatherface.You didnt even come close,Mr.Zombie.The only thing missing from this total rip-off was a chainsaw.Tobe Hooper should sue Rob Zombie's ass off.What a scam."
3,worth the wait,this movie was definately worth the wait -I wish they did not edit the movie it could not be any worse than friday the 13th series or nightmare on elm street-i hope they come out with an un edited version on dvd-The movie is worth going to see-it will keep you in full suspense and definatly has a different ending than most horror movies.
5,Zombie is Awesome!!!,This movie is by far one of the best movie's i've seen since TCM and the Friday the 13th movies. When I heard for the first time it was coming out three years ago i was so excited. Then they gave it an x rating and pulled out. I was [mad]. I heard it was coming out again i was overjoyed. I had to drive to another state just to go see it. I loved every minute of it. Then they put it in a theatre in my town. It lasted 2 days. ... Anyways I can't wait till' it comes out on DVD.
3,Interesting ways to show blood and gore.,"Going into this movie, I thought it was going to be scarier than anything I have ever seen. But, halfway though the movie, I was wondering just when Zombie was going to start with the fear factor. This movie has plenty of blood and gore ... (Makes you wonder just what the NC-17 version would have been like). There were some very interesting parts in the movie. But, mostly the movie just seemed to jump here and there without any real direction.I found myself confused and wondering what was going on more often than once. There were actually people walking out of the threatre when I saw it. But, if you want to see a crazy movie, this is the one. I would wait until it comes out on DVD/Video and spend your money on renting it. With the price of tickets nowdays, I can't honestly say that this movie is worth the amazingly high prices."
4,Zombie's First Try A Very Good One,"I saw this movie on opening night and I walked away happy. I did expect better from Zombie but I was not disappointed. I'll save my final judgement for the uncut version(since it originally had an nc-17 rating). It played like a Texas Chainsaw Massacre movie with a few plot twists. Zombie did create some very nice areas that broke away from the movie and the camera work was excellent. Beautiful idea to bring back some of the b-movie horror stars the now generation have not seen. I didn't jump from fear, I didn't turn my head from gore, but I laughed in all the right spots and was able to follow the film during the intense spots. I was bound and determined to like this movie and guess what....I did. I think if you like this type of movie, you'll like this movie."
1,Glad I didnt have to pay for it!!!,"I was looking through the used DVD rack at 1 of the movie stores in town, and I picked out 3 good things (Shrek 2, Harry Potter 3, and This thing called Beneath The Crust, The stuff American Pie 2 didn't show you), and couldnt faind a 4th DVD, Its a buy 2, get 2 free deal, anyway for my second free one I didnt know what to get, and my friend said this was good, so I said What the (heck), I might as well, so I went ahead and chose this, boy was that a dumb thing to do, Rob Zombie is a much better actor than director, This is just a Texas Chainsaw Massacre rip-off!!! Plus why the hell didnt Rob Zombie find a REAL cast for this movie and leave these stupid unknown kids, and his stupid ugly wife out of this, well any way, this is a terrible film, and if you want a good one go get Texas Chainsaw Massacre and leave this bad film to be forgotten... hopefully, but since I DID sit through this I can say there is worse, so 1 1/2 stars."
1,SUCK. ASS.,"This is the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. I have officially lost all respect for rob zombie. The movie is crap to begin with. It's just a bunch of hicks who somehow manage to capture tourists and kill them. I don't even know how they couldve pulled off anything they did even if they combined brain power. And the people being tortured, well, in less than 5 minutes you wanted them to die, cuz they were just as freaking stupid as the hicks. Don't even bother watching this."
1,House of 1000 Disappointments,"Despite Rob Zombie's efforts, this movie was a HUGE disappointment. For the true horror buffs out there, House of 1000 corpses is nothing more than an entirely unoriginal conglomorate of horror films rolled into one trite, over-the-top and overly long presentation. It was basically a pumped up version of Mother's Day, a horror film written and directed by Charles Kaufman in 1980. Don't waste a precious moment of your life on it."
2,What a build up and let down,"I also waited a long time for this movie to come out. Maybe I had high expectations but, I thought Rob Zombie was a little more original than this. I have read the reviews where people call this movie a welcome throwback to 70's horror. I call it a rip off of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre without the feeling of terror. When Massacre came out it was original, shocking, and a shot in the arm to the horror industry. This movie is none of that. The best part of the Movie is when we actually get to see Dr. Satan, but sadly it comes late in the movie and only for a brief moment. If they would have focused more on Dr. Satan and less on the inbred [...], maybe I would have had better things to say. I can only hope and pray that Rob Zombie will redeem himself with a ""directors cut"" dvd."
2,"BE REAL, PEOPLE!!!","It's not brilliant, it's hardly original, much makes no sense at all, and it isn't even self-deprecating enough to laugh at. It's a very mediocre ""horror"" film, with lots of so-called ""artistic"" footage of Zombie trying to impress people with his film techniques that add nothing to the film. Wait for it on cable."
2,This did not accomplish what Zombie wanted.,"Zombie wanted the audience to sympathize with the killers. These killers are the most unsympathetic group I have ever come across in a movie. Not only was there a total absence of a plot, but it was just gory (which is why I rated it two stars instead of one) and unrealistic. There needs to be a story told about the characters. There needs to be a purpose. Not just some annoying hicks who enjoy torturing innocent people. That doesn't make the audience like the characters. Sorry Zombie, you failed. The best part of both movies was the end of the Devil's Rejects, only then does the audience sort of like the killers but then they get killed."
5,Inspirational,One of the best horror films to come out in a long time. This movie along with The Devils rejects have really inspired me to get into the movie business. The makeup and props used in the film are outstanding. The depth or each character is much better than any horror movie to be released in the last fifteen years. The HO1KC has quickly become one of my favorite films and has been a great inspiration for my halloween decorating for this year
1,Long wait...Big Disappointment,This movie was absolutely horrible. It was the most disappointing movie ever.It was so hyped up like it was the best horror movie ever and it blew. I don't recomend it to anyone. The only enjoyable thing about it is the things that the clown says in the DVD menu's.
2,...pointless,crazy azz people slaughtering innocent people for no reason? im surprised it didn't win an award for best movie of the year
1,One horrible use of a bunny suit,"This movie was horrible. Unless you like to see cannibles and insane and/or dying naked women, do not buy this video. I wish I had had this advice when I was thinking of buying it. Don't get me wrong, I love horror movies as much as the next person, but this movie was a big ...disappointment. ..."
1,Where's the director's cut?,"First, let me say that I loved this movie when I saw it in theaters. I couldn't wait to get it on DVD so Rob Zombie could put in the footage deemed too graphic for an R release.Now, it's coming out on DVD, but where's the director's cut?I think people should save their money until the director's cut comes out. The DVD companies love to do this. Put out a movie. Get people to buy it. Then, put out a better version in an effort to get people to buy their movies more than once."
1,Where's the director's cut?,"I didn't give this one star because I didn't like the movie. I loved the movie. I was very excited when I found out it was coming out on DVD. However, I was extremely disappointed to find out there is no director's cut featuring the footage that had to be cut out.Now I have to wait for the director's cut. This is something DVD companies love to do. Put out a movie. Get people to buy it. Then, some time later, release a bonus version, thinking people will buy it again.Stay away from this DVD until the director's cut is finally released!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,A pure Sadisitc Horror-filled movie,"Gore gallore and nothing else. No plot, insulting images, disturbing content, revolting language and filled with nothing but that. Horror fanatics will devour this movie, but I couldn't simply understand how anybody would enjoy this. Sure i am a huge fan of horror, but this wasn't horror. And whats with this Work Of Demonic Brilliance stuff? There is no Brilliance in this movie, just idiotic."
3,Good Halloween Flick,"when i first rented this movie, i really didnt know what to expect. but when i put it on, i was drawn into it from the '70s halloween feel it was giving. the movie starts out great but then as you head towards the end of it, it really starts to slack off on things, and you really don't know whats going on. it can get cheesey sometimes, but not enough to make you turn it off. house of 1000 corpses is a good flick to put on aorund halloween time. but if you're just looking for a movie to watch, don't watch this."
2,Wha' happen'd,"I had heard only positive reviews of this film and have to admit I was extremely curious about it. Finally, returning to the realm of REAL horror, a splatter film in the post-Scream world. I waited for a nice, dark night to sit down and watch it, all a jitter. It starts out wonderfully, the blend of dizzing direction and music lets you know you're in for an awesome experience and when the four hapless teenagers take in a hitchhiker, I was ready for the carnage to begin. So, what happened?Shallow characters? Sure, but that's a horror movie for you. Plus, the Firefly family is fun, grotesque, exciting, disgusting all at once. And then the movie just kind of fizzles due to overly-pretentious direction and confusion. As a fellow reviewer pointed out, it degrades into how many horrible ways you can torture unsympathetic teenage characters and for what? This movie hints at a plot but never follows through with one, making the end a garbled mess. A shame."
1,don't waste your time,"Definitely one of the worst ""horror"" movies I've ever seen. Not scary, not entertaining, not even worth the time to write much more about."
1,Perhaps one of the worst films ever made.,"I'm a cheezy horror movie fan. I loved the Evil Dead series, and I considered ""Freddy v. Jason"" one of the best ideas anyone has ever had for a movie. That said, I hated--nay, LOATHED--""House of 1000 Corpses"".With movies like this, you must have one of three things: a great story, a story so bad it's good, and/or buckets of blood. ""House"" has none of it. The 'story' is wayward; it weaves around the movie like a drugged and drunken pirate. It's so bad that it cannot, by any rational means, be dubbed charming, obtuse, avante-garde, or for that matter, bearable. And, to be perfectly morbid, the deaths they bothered to show were blahze in the extreme.I honestly felt like mangling something when the film was FINALLY over--perhaps the title was meant to indicate how many people died of boredom, or killed from frustration, after watching this movie?"
1,genius denied,"Rob Zombie's genius has once again been [debased] by the FCC. The version of his movie ""House of 1000 Corpses"" released into theaters recently cannot possibly be the vision Zombie had when he started the project. For the FCC to give the movie an R rating it has effectivly neutered the vision. Anyone out there with personal integrity will [avoid] this watered down theater version and wait patiently for the un-edited DVD release."
2,1000 yawns,"I know I know I'm supposed to know this ""film"" is one of throw back 70's gore and ""art"" if you will. But please...It appeared Zombie couldnt figure out how to make a simple horror film. If the movie stayed with Spaulding's place and made that the resting place for good ole gore, this flick would have had a scarier image and ending. Instead its off we go to an ole farm house where the gore family is sliced and diced amongst many pictures of blurry, wildly colored up ""scary"" images that's supposed to give you a kick and a good ole scream. Instead this one gave me a good ole yawn. I did watch the whole movie through though. That's should be enough to say..go ahead and see this one..for no other reason as to see why you dont make films such as this one. wow. Had the flick been as cool as the poster art this one would have great."
1,Geez........,"Thank goodness I bought this movie cheap!!! Saying it is one hell of a great horror movie, I was anxious to see it. Boy, did that soon change. This movie is stupid, stupid, stupid!!!!!! Even the gore in this movie does not make it deserve more than one star in my book. Horrible acting, poor writing and cheap filming! Rob Zombie can do better than this...... I hope! Don't waste your money!!!"
1,Worst Movie of 2003,"The only people who rate this movie good are the ones who are trying to sell you a copy! This movie was aweful, bad story line and bad ending. There goes almost 2 hours of my life I will never get back."
2,So disappointed,"What started as both a welcome homage and original work from a man who is outspoken and confident on the topic of oldy-style horror films quickly degenerated into bordom. The movie starts out fine, after all it is hard to be completely original in the genre. However near the end of the movie it loses it's way completely, editing becomes quick and Zombie seems to be desperately forcing in one tribute or cliché in after another. There's nothing uniquely scary and any disturbing element comes from ""what the hell is he going to cram in next?"" not from worthwhile plot twists or story elements. The heroine / victim runs through a plot that seems more like a spooky horror ride from a carnival or midway than a frightening, horrific situation. Try again, Mr. Zombie. You can do better."
3,House of 1000 Corpses or TCM2,Not a bad movie however i loved it when i saw it back in 1986 when it was called Texas Chainsaw Massacre part 2.I'll give Rob Zombie credit though there were definately some disturbing and crazy moments in this movie. And casting Bill Moseley who played chop top in TCM2 was an excellent idea. If you are going to pay homage to a great movie do it right and i must say Rob Zombie did.
4,Good Movie But...,"For Rob Zombie's film debut I thought he did very well. This movie depicted the messed up, deep, dark mind of Rob Zombie. The plot of the movie was not orignal but i'm not going to sit here and badmouth it. This movie gave me a break from all the teen slasher movies(Scream, I Know What You Did Last Summer) and gave me some messed up, deep, dark thoughts. This movie did not scare me but it did introduce me into the mind that is Rob Zombie. The actors in this movie were plain horrible except for Sig Haig. They could have also gone into more detail on Dr. Satan's life but Zombie didnt. I give it 8.0/10 or............"
2,Zombie's Homage To The Classics Falls Miserably Short...,"I really wanted to like this movie. I REALLY DID!But...unfortunately I was very disappointed. Rob Zombie attempts to pay homage to the REAL greats of the slasher/horror genre like Tobe Hooper, John Carpenter, and Wes Craven but fallls miserably short and also steals much from other older, better movies of this type. A rip-off of Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Last House On The Left, The Hills have Eyes, and MANY, MANY other cult classics.More disgusting and trashy doesn't mean better, Rob. BUT... If I had to say something positive about the DVD...The disc features are so banal and trailer-trashy, that they are almost WORTH RENTING (not BUYING) this DVD. Really, the ONLY reason I gave 2 stars instead of 1... Buyer Beware!"
5,Sickly Beautiful,"There is one word to sum up this movie...beautiful. I did not know what to excpect at all. After the movie was finished I was in awe. I wish the legend of Doctor Satan was true. This movie was disgusting, it was disturbing, it was absolutely PERFECT. What an enchantingly vivid mind Rob Zombie has. Not a movie for little kiddies. I loved the torture and the horrifically dazzling costumes. A great All Hallows Eve classic. I don't understand why people do not enjoy this movie. Violence and blood galore what more could you ask for?"
1,I WANT MY 93 MINUTES BACK!!!!!!!!,"Luckily I rented this movie, because it sucks! I would ask Blockbuster for a refund, but I would much rather have the 93 minutes back that I spent watching this trash!"
1,What a complete turkey,"This movie actually starts off well. The spooky funhouse/freakshow is a good idea. Unfortunately, it ends up being one of the worst horror movies I've ever seen.The most striking flaw is that it's a complete rip-off of Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Group of young kids, travelling through an out-of-the-way country town where the folks are a bit weird, come across a hitchhiker and end up being slaughtered by a family of cannibals/satanists/something. One of the bad guys even makes a mask out of a dead guy's face. Tobe Hooper should be paid royalties from this movie. Can you spell P-L-A-G-I-A-R-I-S-M?From there, it goes from being a bad rip off of Texas Chainsaw to being just plain stupid. It makes no sense, you stop caring about any of the characters and what's happening, and it's not scary in the slightest."
5,One of the best horror films i've personally seen,"Rob Zombie is a creative genius. I saw this movie on April 12th and everything just came full circle for me. I first heard of this films about two years ago and have been following the news of it up to the day that I finally saw it. I loved every minute of the film. I could instantly tell that it was a labor of love. It had no generic feel to it whatsoever and even though the basic storyline isn't original, the whole story is unlike anything that I have ever seen. I like Rob's vision and if he chooses to make another film, i'm almost certain that I will see it."
1,Rob Zombie Owes Me 10 bucks,"This was the most horrible movie I have seen in the last 10 years. It was boring and painful to sit through, even though the running time is under an hour and a half. Stick to music and cartoons, Mr. Zombie. Not everyone can make a movie."
4,Does this stick?,This is the first movie directed by Zombie and its good. It made me love horror movies once again because of the way he shot the film. The only problem I had is he tried to stuff so much into one film that it seemed like he was trying to hard. Still entertaining and not as polished as Devil's Rejects. The commentary is great as always because Zombie is honest about his films and gives good insight to what he was thinking.A major reason too get this dvd is the dvd menu. Its probably the best dvd menu ever.
3,The Holy Grail of Gore Horror,"Seeing as how this film is only going to have a limited release, I suggest you go see it this weekend with a lady friend. A chance to see a film of this sort in the theatre is a rare one, and you best take up the oppurtunity given to you. What we have on our hands here is some ultra-cool 70s vintage gore horror taken to the extreme. Rob Zombie directs some very skilled character actors in an intentionally cliched plot of ""stop for gas, get mixed up in bloody hijinks"". Zombie laid the archetype foundations and then went where no horror film with a wide release has gone before. I found it minimally entertaining, but those who enjoy horror movies will probably love it. I think I'll go see it again."
2,Either I'm stupid or this movie is....,"I'm not discounting the first possibility, but I'm not sure I got the point of the movie.In the end, were the Fireflys survivors of Dr. Satan? Beats me. I kind of felt like the whole movie was one series of horror videos loosely (very) tied together with random camera effects (solarization EVERYWHERE, twists, pulls, flashes) and jagged editing.The acting was horrible, although Karen Black used to be a real actress. In this, she's just a large, leering figure who sole purpose is...beats me. She's kind of the 'mother' to the bunch, but beyond that...I dunno.Baby was the only one I really liked and I wished they focussed more on her. Her cackling giggle is completely irritating but at least she's reasonably easy on the eyes.I wasn't scared. I wasn't even disgusted. What I was left with was mild curiousity about the ending. As I understand it, Zombie is working on HO10KCorpses 2. Lotsa luck with that..."
1,This was ...,The movie lacked any real coherense and seemed to be lost for what it wanted to be. Did not disturb me or make me laugh. All it did was waste 9.50 of my money and 2 hours of my life. The audience making fun of the movie during it was more entertaining than the terribly boring movie.
2,"Depraved murder/sex/filth scenes, nothing else.","Just because a movie has an edgy sountrack and good cinematography does not make it a good movie. If you like scene after scene of disturbing murder/torture then get it I guess.For the people raving about the movie: quit kidding yourselves and admit that the only reason you enjoyed this film is because you get your kicks from filthy torture/murder scenes. You love it, and this movie gives it to you extra-value-meal-style."
1,Don't waste your time,Rob Zombie needs to stick to his music and B horror movie collection as opposed to making them. This movie was a total let down and a complete waste of time and money. Not even worth waiting for the made for tv version.
1,God awful blood vehicle,"Zombie attempts to glamorize his gore-fest by saying it's a tribute to '70's horror flicks, but the movie is the trashiest, most god awful waste of film I've ever seen. I regret even thinking Zombie had made a decent film."
1,Retreadsville...,"This film had nothing new. It ripped off other films and had no gore whatsoever. And the bad 70s rock video ""special effects"" were just plain ridiculous. There was no plot, it wasn't scarey and the dark humour was too predictable.The best part about the DVD was the menu system.The movie itself sucked ass.Zero stars should have been istigating for this stinker..."
4,The creepiest movie ever made.,"I've seen the ""top 100"" horror flicks and many more besides; and there is no doubt in my mind that ""House of 1000 Corpses"" is the creepiest horror movie ever made. The teens in this movie are like normal kids--they aren't Hollywood pretty kids. And the freaks aren't particularly unrealistically bizarre (consider the Manson family)--they're just terrifying psychotic sociopaths who seem to be having a fairly good time. After seeing this movie, I have to hail Rob Zombie as the King of Creepiness. I'm giving it 4 stars because there are (only) a couple of things that I would change."
2,This should have rocked--what happened??!!,"I love horror films and enjoy metal music so I should have been happy with this film. The DVD is great, in essence, with the menu intros and the hidden features but that does not make up for a bad movie. I have seen worse but it seems that Rob Zombie needs to work a little harder. The beginning was great with Captain Spaulding and the ending, with DR. SATAN, was interesting, but the middle just lagged. It would seem Rob wanted to pay homage to his favorite gore flicks from the 1970's but it just fell so short and seemed to have no real direction. I felt no suspense and I really did not feel the urge for the victims to escape or for the villians to win. I just really wanted it to end. I borrowed this film from a friend and I am so gald that I did not actually purchase it. I have heard that he is working on a follow-up to this movie and I hope it is better then this film."
4,"""Got Blood All Over""",I have been looking over some of the reviews and I see that this movie is not favored by many but I thought it was good. I love the beging where it shows you what those redneck hicks were like. I thought it was actually not that scary and it really didnt have much of a plot. But it was very fun to watch and great characters.
2,Long awaited and unfortunately dissapointing.,"I just returned from watching this movie, I've waited more than 2 years to see. I expected so much more from all the hype.If you're a fan of Rob Zombie, If you've been to any of his shows or his old White Zombie shows and you loved their stage act you will love this movie. Tons of over the top melodrama, unbelievable characters, gore and confusion reign in this film school dropout's version of texas chainsaw massacre.I hate to say this about a musician that I respect and who's music I enjoy, but if you aren't a [real] fan I suggest you wait until it hits the pay channels. There is no plot to speak of and no characters to identify with. Sid Haig's character is th only one that is engaging and he has a bit part in the film as the proprietor of a creepy gas station. If you are looking for an intelligent horror film that will keep you guessing and interested this is not it."
2,Can This Be any More of a Texas Chainsaw Copy? (Inferior),"In essence, this is a Texas Chainsaw remake, but here's the difference, and why it's far inferior. I don't care one iota for the ""victims."" I can barely tell the females apart. The guys are so obnoxious, I look forward to them dying. Unlike Texas Chainsaw (parts one and two, horror masterpieces!), this movie shows the ""psycho family"" (hmmm... kind of like Texas Chainsaw?) far too much. A little goes a long way, too much? OVERKILL! Many plot holes, and take away the music, there was some really bad acting. It gets two stars for the cool middle inserts in funky film style, and also the one great sequence where the cops are killed. But in general, Rob Zombie should not get writing credit for this. It's Texas Chainsaw Massacre, only nowhere near as good."
3,average!,just an average old b horror type movie! nothing really cool except for the special effects.No story!but should still watch it!
1,Spare Me,Aight.... I was waiting for something that will knock me outta my seat. PUH-LEASE. Whatta waste of tape! It wasn't scary at all... the only thing that came to my mind was annoying. I swear I could hear that blonde chicks laugh in my head days after I watched the movie! I wanted to spoon my eyes out. If you see this movie on the shelf burn it.
3,House of 1000... Massacre,"Looking past the fact that this is nothing more than Texas Chainsaw Massacre, this movie isn't bad. Where the movie lacks in orginality, humor and great effects pick up the slack. The characters are likable in a morbid way and watch the performance of Sid Haig... hilarious. The movie is none the less entertaining and there are some extremely morbid scenes. After you get done being pissed you just watch the other Chainsaw remake, you'll see a played out idea presented fairly well."
5,One of the best,"I realy enjoyed this movie. I saw it 4 times in the theatre then watched it 3 more times when i purchased the DVD, and I plan on watching it more. The begining with Captain Spaulding Captured me and i was hooked from there. The movie isn't too gorey, but gore doesn't always make a good movie. The writing was awsome the acting was fine, and thats everything you want in a horror movie. People who bash this movie because it wasn't gorey enough for them need to grow up and appreciate good film making. Don't get me wrong, i like gorey a$$ed movies too like Dead Alive, i am just saying horror movies don't always have to be gorey to be good."
3,Poor Job on Zombies Part,I'm a huge fan of horror movies and Rob Zombie so when I found out he had a movie coming out I was excited. Excitment was not what I got from watching this movie. I expected great works from Rob Zombie and was left disapointed. Half of the movie I was either spacing out or lost in confusion. Not the best movie to spend money on.
1,Blows untold herds of chipmunks,"This movie was terrible! So bad that to even critique it zaps me of energy, so i will make it brief. First of all, don't tell me i misunderstood it, or don't know what Rob Zombie was trying to accomplish. Where it was supposed to be funny, it wasn't; where it was supposed to be scary, it wasn't. It was all over the place. They never even really explain just what the hell Dr. Satan is...or why he still exists. And just what is the motivation behind the psycho family? and how are they tied to dr. Satan?? ugh! i can't go on. Maybe i missed something while trying to stay awake."
1,ZZZZZZZZZZZ,"Basically the movie is just people running around an expensive haunted house. Not that bloody or gory either, so if you were looking for that, you'll be disspointed. But if you were just looking for pointless, bloodless, abuse of Scooby Doo horror cliches (yes, I know it was homage to classic horror like TCM, but seriously, it's boring and an overkill that didn't need to be made), then I guess you'll enjoy it. Me personally I'm open to all horror, fom exploitation to the occult, and this one just didn't satisfy me. This is just Rob Zombie trying too hard to prove to the world that he's the biggest fan of Texas Chainsaw Massacre (which was an okay film, although gets overrated for being gory, hence why it's laugahable when people deduct this movie to be gory just for the association with TCM)."
1,Ashamed of Rob Zombie.,"I am so ashamed of Rob Zombie. I'm surprised he didn't get sued by all the other movies he ripped off to make this debacle. It has little imagination, and is basically a rip off of Texas Chainsaw Massacre and a few other horror movies rolled into one. The best part of this movie is the Menu on the DVD where some of the characters come out and have some funny monologue. Don't waste your time watching this stupidity."
1,The Worst Movie EVER!!!,"Being a horror fan since childhood,(yes, childhood)I thought I'd give this movie a shot. What it needs is a shot in the head. This has got to be the worst movie ever written!! The movie is disjointed, there is absolutely no plot, and it continually wastes your time with these ""Oh, I'm so clever... look-what-I-learned-in-film-class negative exposure shots."" To top it off, the credits end with ""The End?"" which couldn't BE more fitting considering that ""Manos: The Hands of Fate"" ended the same way (by the way, how unoriginal). What it comes down to is that I would rather watch Mariah Carey's ""Glitter"" 1,000 times than to ever have to sit through one minute of ""House of 1,000 Corpses"" again. Enough said."
4,I'm a Rob Zombie Fan (movies),"hahha not a bad movie, but if you are not a fan of ""weird"" movies, just rent it."
3,imaginative and uneven,"It has a thin plot (four 20-somethings do some amateur investigating of a local serial killer, and find a family of serial killers) and horrible pacing (no tension; no scares; lots of telegraphing and clich's), but House of a 1000 Corpses has so much style and energy that it almost excuses itself. Almost. There is little else in this nasty flick besides sadistic violence and unrelenting blood drawn by freaks. Gore-hounds are the only audience assured their jollies. This film is a bodycount in carnivale trappings. The frenetic editing and the creepy character designs only add to the episodic nature of the film, but the acting is decent given the script. In the future, I'd love to see Rob Zombie direct a screenplay he didn't write. His direction, designs and insults embedded in the dialogue are masterful, but the plotting is very weak. Despite its major faults, this is a first film that is worth a look."
3,ZOMBIE'S ZOMBIES,"Two young couples terrorized by a family of inbred maniacs is taken to extremes in Rob Zombie's way over-the-top gonzo gore-fest, HOUSE OF 1000 CORPSES (Lion's Gate). Made under a deal with Universal, it was dropped when the suits saw the final cut (no pun intended). A genuine cult flick that's a throwback to blood-drenched 70s drive-in Italian imports."
3,"It's alright, but don't believe the hype","House of 1000 Corpses isn't by any means a bad movie...it looks great, it's extremely out there and the acting is pretty above average for this genre. But don't let the fact that this was dropped by two different movie studios fool you...the movie is not at all scary, and it really isn't even all that gory. And it does kind of feel like a 2nd or 3rd-hand version of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre at times...but it's at least worth seeing once. If for no other reason, see it for Sheri Moon, Rob Zombie's girlfriend...wow!"
1,This was just a waste of time.Boo!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This movie sucked. Rob Zombie's art used to be making songs about cheesy horror flick type stuff and that was awesome but this movie just showed that he also has a new art(making incredibly stupid,unarguably cheesy horror flicks).What the hell was he thinking?Despite the review Tobe Hooper gave him, this movie is nowhere near as good as Poltergeist and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre(those movies kicked ass!).Personally I think Tobe Hooper should have kicked Rob's ass for making this garbage instead of giving him an undeserving round of applause.This is the worst movie Ive ever seen next to Tim Burton's atrocious Planet Of The Apes remake.This sucks!"
1,inane & just plain terrible,"i love horror movies but found this to just be pretty stupid & uninteresting. i don't recommend this if you want chills or anything else for that matter. i think this movie will appeal only to a select small group of people interested in goofy movies like this. save your money, there's a reason the studios dropped this one!!!!"
4,Good old fashioned throw back.,"There is nothing to this movie but gore and blood. It is a good old fashioned throw back to the horror movies of yore. It is not scary, just gross. You are never in the throes of suspense and you really do not care that everyone is gonna die. You actually will find yourself wanting everyone to die. And, lucky for you, they all do. The one major flaw is towards the end. It is the introduction of the supernatural. It almost seems as if you have left this movie to embark on a living dead sequal to then be spit back out in to this movie.But then again, who cares, you are not watching this so you can think and ponder. You are watching it to see people get hacked to death and see blood dripping on everything.Death, blood and gore.Nothing more, nothing less...."
1,Boring movie,"""The movie does lack suspense,scare and shock value, but it is very enjoyable and entertaining.""Above is an actual quote from a review who gave this garbage movie 4.5 stars. At one point I switch from this movie to watch baseball. Nothing original....nothing suspenseful,...nothing that reaches into you mind to make you think or worry or fear. Just random images of gore. Trust me, if you saw CNN show the bodies of Uday and Qusay then there is nothing in this movie that could scare you. Does anyone over 18 still get scared just be seeing blood or dead bodies??? How many times can this be rehased before its just not fun. Another positive reviewer said if you loved the texas chainsaw massaccre etc the youll love this one. Thats the whole point. What fun is there in watching a movie that is exactly like another movie?"
2,it had potential,"this movie was a lot like the texas chain saw massacure in some ways, but it was way more bizarre, which took away from the movie. it had a good plot but the cut secnes were a little to much and didn't help the movie at all they just got annoying. i think if the movie was the people trying to escape from doctor satan and not the hillbillies the whole movie it would be way more cool an a better movie. i thought the guy with the axe at the end was really cool and should have been in the movie more. i just think they whole dr. satan was a good idea and if was in the movie more could have been really cool"
2,Should have been a silent Movie,"Wow. I watched this movie just last night, and what a waste of time. As a music video, this would have been great. It was definitely a visual feast and was artfully crafted--to be played along with heavy rock or techno music. The dialog was trite, the plot (what plot?) was lost amidst the imagery. And as for gore, this movie was not the life-scarring blood fest it was reputed to be. I'm rather glad of that, actually. When it was all over I actually wished I had better spent my time ironing or washing dishes. It's probably worth a look, but not much else."
2,Rob Zombie Fan,"This movie seemed to be aimed at shocking and horrifying people rather than actually giving anyone a good scare. I couldn't believe something this grotesque could come out of one persons mind. I can only count two times in this movie where I actually felt scared. I can't, however, begin to count the ammount of times I felt appauled and disguested. I'm a horror-film lover, but this passes the limit of being tastefully scary and dives into insanity. I give this movie a 2 for effort...but it just went too far. If these are images into the brain of Rob Zombie, I'm thinking a psychiatrist is in order."
1,Tommy Tucker!,"A bag of [stuff]!I missed this at the London Frightfest in August 2003 and should have left my curiosity there. No suspense whatsoever, resulting only in a torrent of annoying, unfrightening characters. Avoid like the plague as this is so crass I won't even commit 100 words to a review!I wish there was less than one star available in amazon reviews!"
2,not even close,"Not even close to living up to the hype...maybe if it had been the full uncut version as it was meant to be...if you're looking for gore or massive amounts of violence buy a japanese or european film, this is lame. Couldn't have ripped off TCM and TCM2 more without bringing out a chainsaw. Visual style was also a heavy rip of Natural Born Killers."
1,"If you like anything filmed, avoid at all costs!!!!","Likening this to an already outdated music-video expanded into an inept idea is being nice. Pointless, not scary, not sexy at all, and BLAND - this fails as an even basic horror film. I could poop a monopoly playing piece with more flavor than this rotting piece of awful."
3,"Go, Rob Zombie!","House of 1000 Corpses reminded me of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre meets The Funhouse, as directed by Oliver Stone. Zombie definitely has talent as a director, but the material was just too tired (for me) to rate five stars. If you like horror, and you like Rob Zombie, then 'House' is definitely a keeper. I have a feeling that if he doesn't catch ""sequelitis"" Zombie could have a good directing career ahead of him."
1,this movie stinks rob zombie is a fake and a fraud and a hack!!!!!!!,rob zombie has proved that he is the worst director in hollywood this movie is only focused on shock value not scares or chills or thrills rob zombie is seriously is one terrible film maker and he puts his wife in way too many of his movies i never liked rob zombie to begin with his music is ok but him in the directors chair well lets just say he is the worst movie director on earth this movie looks and sounds like one big epic rob zombie music video which = lame and uber boring and stupid!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,ROB ZOMBIES MASTERPIECE!,"AN EXCELLENT MOVIE!YOU WON'T WANT TO STOP WATCHING IT BECAUSE YOU CAN'T WAIT TO SEE WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN NEXT.IT'S VERY GRAPHIC.IT'S SUSPENSEFUL,GORY,AND EXCITING.FROM START TO FINISH-THERE'S HAPPENINGS GOING ON.ONE MAN GETS DISMEMBERED WHILE STILL ALIVE.A COUPLE OF CHEERLEADERS GETS TORTURED,AND ABUSED TO DEATH.LATER ON,THERE'S THIS BUILDING UNDERGROUND WHERE WEIRDOS,AND DR.DEATH LIVE.DR.DEATH LAYS PEOPLE ON A TABLE AND DOES EXPERIMENTS WITH THEM STILL ALIVE.HE CUTS OPEN THEIR STOMACH AND REMOVES THEIR ORGANS.HE DOES THINGS TO THEIR BRAINS.IT'S A SLOW AND TORTUROUS DEATH.BILL MOSELEY(OTIS FIREFLY)SHERI MOON(BABY FIREFLY),AND SID HAIG(CAPTAIN SPAULDING-THE FATHER FIREFLY)ALL HAVE EXCELLENT ACTING ABILITIES.THEY PLAYED THEIR PARTS PERFECTLY.I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE!IF YOU HAVE A SENSITIVE STOMACH-DON'T GET THIS DVD."
1,Three Yawns For This Bluff Flick,"The story is a monument of clichés; the acting is forced and amateurish; the plot - if you can call it a plot, is so predictable it feels like a 2-hour déjà-vu trip; the whole thing looks more like a music video than a real movie. In other words, Rob Zombie should stick to his music antics and spare us the cinematographic nonsense. A horror movie? My heartbeat didn't go above 65. Only redeeming value: the visuals, for which I will give it a star. Watch it while preparing dinner, them watch a real movie..."
1,2 precious hours of my life gone:(,What an absolutely horrible movie. It wasn't scary or gory just really stupid. I don't understand how some of you people could give this junk 5 stars but hey some people like different things. The only thing i felt while watching this crapfest was incredibly bored. ROB ZOMBIE STICK TO MUSIC!!!!! YOU SUCK AS A DIRECTOR!!!!
1,(...),"i can't believe i bought this crap according to all the enthusiastic reviews...Oh my, i am a horrormovie fan over 30 years nowand i really have seen hundrets of movies, but this...this is surely one of the WORST movies i've ever seen!There is absolutely no suspense, nothing scary or frightening.The strange ""funny"" music over the gore-scenes makes everything totally ridiculous,and the ""bad guy"" actors are so over the top that it is not even funny!What the hell should that 1 minute still execution scene mean?äähhhh???The ""cinematographic"" sytle is nothing but annoying andseems like some jerky teenagers dreams of ""lets make a horror movie!""I find it really blasphemic to call this concotion ""a hommage to 70s horror"",or even compare it to Texas Chainsaw Massacre.The only thing disturbing about this movie is its unbelievable stupidity!It is so uninspired, incomprehensible, unintelligent and really just dumb, dumb, dumb!Compared to this, BLOOD FEAST looks like an intelligent art-movie!"
1,NOT WORTH A MOMENT OF YOUR TIME...JUST STUPID,Nothing original. Nothing scary. Nothing suspenseful. Nothing intelligent. Shock value for 18 year olds that live in trailer parks drinking Coors in their tank tops and underwear. Blair Witch meets Texas Chainsaw meets Mother's Day meets Maniac meets Texas Chainsaw II meets Funhouse = YAWN. Wake me when something original occurs. SAVE YOUR MONEY. SAVE YOUR TIME.
1,ONE STAR because ZERO STARS wasn't available,"If negative stars were a possibility, I'd rate this 'film' at Negative One Hundred Thousand.What. A. Piece. Of. Unbelievable. CRAP.I had the highest of hopes for this movie. (Not high expectations--come on, Rob Zombie's not going to come up with a new 'The Haunting'.) But I was hoping for a thriller along the lines of 'Texas Chainsaw' (the original, not the god-awful remake).Instead, we are presented with this. It makes a student film with cinematography by Stevie Wonder, a script written by Forrest Gump and a femme fatale played by Geri Jewell look like 'Lawrence of Arabia.' Who was holding the cameras--a wall-eyed spastic? Karen Black is the ugliest woman in creation (hey, speaking of wall-eyes) and she could have done more here, but you only see her for a total of about two minutes.I can't even write. I'm flabbergasted, flummoxed and flapped to flinders by this flotsam. Rob Zombie is the ultimate retardo king of the Universe."
4,"If you don't like it, you probably DON'T GET IT!","i'm sick of all you idiots giving movies like ""strangeland"" and ""house of a 1000 corpses"" bad ratings! you don't have a clue what you are talking about! if you are a normal person ( aka mainstreem) then you're most likely not going to understand this movie! if you don't like rob zombies music, you aren't going to like his movies! This movie actully is pretty cool, if you are into all this kind of stuff. i would advise renting before buying. alot of people are disgusted by this movie and think its really stupid! I think its cool and funny! at first i didn't like it but, it really is kinda of cool! the only reason i didn't give it 5 stars is because some of the actors (the victims) are really obnoxious!"
1,Trash!,"If I could get away with it I wouldn't even give it 1 star. I wouldn't even let my dog see it. Please do not waste your time and money on this pieace of trash. Anybody who would like this movie, and find it remotely any good should consider seeking professional help. This movie was very disturbing and distatefully written. I think Rob Zombie should stick to the music business. Although he isn't any better at that either. If you want to see a really good horror movie, I would suggest a really good Stephen King movie. Rob could learn a few good lessons from the master of horror movies,Mr.Stephen King. I strongly urge you not to let children view this movie."
1,This movie sucks,"This movie really, really sucks. Rob Zombie is a disturbed man. It's definitely not worth watching if you have to pay for it."
4,Really not bad for a Rock Star gone Hollywood director,"This is a really twisted movie. It has everything that a classic horror movie should have, blood, guts and true psychos played by a very convincing cast. This exploitation horror film was lead by Bill Moseley as Otis B. Driftwood, a truly scary SOB. He played primarily in B-Films until he hit Cult Classic Gold with Rob Zombie. Otis leads a family of crazies including a sister Baby Firefly played by Rob Zombie's wife Sheri Moon, 2 brothers, a Mother Firefly & Grandpa Hugo.The true psychos in this movie, as well as the equally gory and much better production quality sequelThe Devil's Rejects (Unrated Widescreen Edition), are Otis & Baby. I honestly believed that these two people where as crazy as their characters. This movie is a cult classic horror film and it's interesting to note that the character names came from Groucho Marx films."
1,The Worst Movie I've Ever Seen,"Rob Zombie, what in the world were you thinking? This movie isn't worth the dirt from my shoes. It's just a waste of money. That guy wearing the clown make-up in the movie is just beyond stupid. And that girl with the long blonde hair that lives in the area of Dr. Satan was just flat out annoying. Every time she laughed I just wanted to smack her. This whole movie is completely stupid. What happened to the real horror films, like Halloween, Friday the 13th, Scream, Carrie? Those were the best. But this movie deserves half a star. Please don't waste your money on this movie, it's defintely not worth it. Rob Zombie, here's a piece of advice, stick to making music, you don't know anything about making movies except how to make ones that suck."
2,INSANE!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I cannot say much more about this movie other than it is completely, and utterly INSANE!!!!Knowing Rob Zombie, it doesn't surpise me in the least that this was created out of his strange and bizarre mind.I seen it once, and that was enough.Too crazy for me. If you have not seen this film, please take anti-psychotic drugs before watching. I am sure this would be a complement to Mr.Zombie, but it isn't meant as one."
5,Very Great Piece of WORK!!!,"This IS a great movie. This IS a horror movie the way it should be. very funny, but it could have been more gory. sucks that it's rated R but it is still worth every penny spent on buying this dvd. hopefully they will put out a director's cut. if not then it is still worth the watch for laughs and enjoyment. THIS ISN'T your average nowadays TEENY BOPPER horror movie, THIS is a REAL piece of ART!!! So teeny boppers, stick to scream and I know what you did last summer because you probably would not like this movie. but for real horror fans, this is a bitchin' movie!!! Nuff said."
2,Liked it when i saw it 20 years ago,"I'm a big fan of Rob Zombie's art and music; however, I was a bit disappointed with this film. In other ways, I was delighted. Rob's aesthetic approach is amazing and his directing spawns colorful, imaginative, and disturbing images throughout the entire film. While imagery is extremely important to me in a film, the story and plot must be original too and in my opinion, Zombie took an already excellent film and modernized it with his artwork and interpretation. If you know what movie I'm talking about (the mother of all horror flicks), don't bother watching this one. It's as if someone were to take a Monet and layer Photoshop work on top of it. House Of 1000 Corpses is beautifully done and VERY gory, but lacks any sense of storyline originality with the exception of one or two parts."
1,Best horror comedy sice Evil Dead 2 5 for being so funny.,"This was much funnier than scary. Not much of a plot, just people getting tortured. The acting strinx, but Captain Spaulding and Dr. Satan make up for all of that. The ending was a little freaky, but overall this isn't that scary. Still this is the thought that pops into peoples mind when they think horror film. A movie with blood guts and gore and sinceless killing. Pure fun cuz after all we think the sight of people dying and being tortured is funny and amusing.lol."
1,Worst movie EVER.,"This movie was possibly one of the worst I have ever seen. I didn't go in expecting too much more than a cheesey horror flick, and was disappointed even then. The acting was atrocious, the special effects were vaguely good. The plot could have been very good, but it's execution was horrible, and thats being nice. I would recommend that NOBODY buy this movie ever."
5,When is the sequal !!!!,I didn't know what to expect when I first saw the previews of this movie. I knew I wanted to see it but I didn't know it was going to be that heavy. If you don't mind a demon or a tortured soul or two this is your movie. Im sure the next time you see a chicken & gas stop on the highway you will keep on rolling and fill up somewhere else. This movie isnt for everybody so put the kids to bed pour yourself a sophistcated drink and enjoy the horror and demonic House.
4,Zombie didn't do a bad job,"To start, I'd like to point out that I like movies with twisted endings and morbid plots, so this will affect my reactions.This film isn't all that terrible, as I'm hearing people say. Most of the bad reviews are due to people not understanding the genre and the ending. The film was very much true to what it's meant to be, a twisted and sick horror film. The typical horror film characters show up and tend to be a bit more extreme than they could be.The weak of stomach could have a hard time getting through some of this, best example is that someone is skinned in the film. Be sure to watch this film substance-free to catch all that goes on in the background, as well as being able to remember it afterwards. By the time the end of the film has come, you'll be wanting to figure out exactly what was going on.If you dig the twisted, this movie is a must. Put it on your ""Top 10 movies to watch"" for the year."
4,House of 1000 Corpses,This movie was cool. It was a little bit of alot of horror flicks I've seen and then some. This was creative but sick at the same time. Whoever wrote it had some imagination!
2,Unoriginal yet entertaining....with a stupid ending........,"Zombie pretty much ripped off several horror movies, mostly Texas Chainsaw 2. It has the gruesome feel and nasty scenes that any horror movie should have, yet they are just not original. It was a decent movie to watch until the ridiculous ending with ""Dr Evil"" in the basement. I pretty much took this movie from a 3.5 star horror to a 2 because of the cheesy ending."
2,OK........Disapointing,OK. I have seen every horror movie under the sun and this one was sad. No horror no suspence and bad scripting. Rob did a great job directing but the problem is the people didnt fit thier roles. But it does have some interesting parts like people being stabbed in bunny suites and girls cutting up a guy to disco funk music...
1,Piece of ...,Another rip off of Texas Chainsaw massacre and an excuse for some gore and a sequel. What is the point of this film? There is no plot and the characters are all one-dimensional and predictable. I suppose this is one of those adolescent films kids talk about at school. Probably appeals to those who still have a childish taste for gore - grow up.
1,Wow! What a crappy movie!,"When I rented this movie, I was expecting a scary film that I would enjoy. However, I ended up getting...something...that had absolutely NO plot whatsoever, or any rational components. It was literally a jumble of random events and film clips that, while at first bad, appeared to be leading somewhere, however it did not. The beginning was confusing and pointless, and even though I hoped for conclusion in the end, all I found was more film clips - in negative form - as well as random, inexplicable characters that served no purpose and settings that did not make sense. My advice to anyone is not to rent this movie, unless you want to mercilessly mock a truly horrible film and waste a couple hours. In the end, all I can say about this movie is...riiight. Whoever thinks that this is art should really get checked out."
1,Sucks,"I'm a huge fan of Rob Zombie's music,unfortunatly I can't say the same about his movies.One of the worst horror movies I've seen.Not worth the price of a rental.If you must see it,get it from your local library."
1,Annoying!,"Since so many people have written what this movie is about, so I won't go into it. While I was watching this movie, I became very annoyed with that blond female. It seems like only roll in this film and that Devil's Reject movie (I think it's the same girl) is for her to just shake her bottom. She certainly cannot dance very well! She really annoyed me, so I was hoping that somehow she'll be just gone from that movie later on, but that didn't happen. Why can't Rob Zombie make a movie with decent actors and actresses who knows how to act?! Why can't he make a movie that aren't always degrading women?! If that blond is the one he is married to, then who is that dark hair girl with the braid in his video? Anyways, if you want to see a good horror film with good acting, well this isn't it!"
3,It was changed,"After being poorly reviewed, I was under the understanding that the movie has undergone some changes, so the first review isn't probably worth that much. I suggest not seeing it on opening night though just in case it doesn't pan out well."
1,"Gleeful, Joyless Sadism","Ya know, you can only say for so long, ""Hey, we're actually making fun of those films,"" to cover what a lame, sick waste-of-time that is HOUSE OF 1000 CORPSES.Not only should some law enforcement agency have the filmmakers' names on a list somewhere, I hope that the unsupervised kids who watch HBO all the time are tracked so we'll know where our future serial killers come from.""Oh, kids shouldn't see this.""Wake up, moron, they do. And I'm willing to guess that a kid who loves this stuff will be bashing cats or poking sticks through dogs before they're teenagers.As for the ""adults"" who like this movie...it's not even that good as a horror movie."
3,something missing,"The film HOUSE OF 1000 CORPSES is a sick thrill ride created by the twisted mind of rocker ROB ZOMBIE. If you can't handle the gore, you were probably allready warned. THat's just the way that the movie is, it's a slasher flick. As far as directing, cinematography, and acting, everything was very much above par. Somehow though somehting just seemed off. There was just somehtign missing. All in all it is a movie that will really get your blood pumping. It is well worth the rental price, but not quite worth buying."
2,Disappointing,"Really poor. Clearly, Rob Zombie was trying way too hard to try to show he knew some film techniques and he went way overboard with them. The last 15 minutes were just over-the-top ridiculous, with some brand new monster coming out of nowhere. When the DVD's main menu commentary is the highlight of the product you've got a real problem. See Wrong Turn instead."
1,Sucktacular...,"I'm a huge cheese-horror fan, but this movie is just dull. I saw it on opening night with a large group of friends, and to be perfectly honest the best part of the experience was when a drunk guy (I hope he was drunk) in the audience began yelling at the screen."
2,Huh?,"Don't get me wrong, I give Rob Zombie credit for writing and directing his first two films though they could've been alot better. I'm all about the campy and the gore but, this one as well as Devil's Rejects, didn't really have alot of depth along with the fact that there was excessive profanity. Same with some of the ludeness.I'm still anxious to see Rob's take on Halloween and I understand that sometimes a first time film maker has to experiment till their films get even better."
3,It's more of a Horror/Music Video........,This movie is NOT for every horror fan. I'm a huge zombie fan (Rob & movies) and I think this is a respectable first movie for Rob considering where his thought processes came from...(music & videos)....the movie is a bit short on dialog and plot but I understand the story. I think his work will continue to improve with every movie he makes! Way to go Rob!
2,"Good enough to rent, not to buy.","This movie got a lot of hype because of Rob Zombie, but the final result on screen is less than spectauclar. It seemed like a HUGE Texas Chainsaw Massacre rip-off if you ask me. The clown at the gift shop was the most entertaining character in the whole film. I love how the DVD has him introducing the movie."
3,The victims are not all that got chopped,"When I first saw this film on cable, I rushed to buy it. It's a guilty pleasure of gore and mayhem. But i was seriously disappointed when I ran the DVD and found that the ""widescreen"" effect was in fact a chopped-down cut of the fullscreen version, with the top and bottom of the fullscreen print lopped to create the illusion of widescreen.This is not the first Lions Gate film where i have seen this done. Other distributors have been known to do this as well.The whole idea of widescreen films is to preserve the theatrical screen ratio, and not chop out the edges of the print. But this practice of bogus widescreen, of further chopping down a chopped-down screen, defeats the whole purpose.The technical information does not mention a screen ratio, which, I suppose, should have sent up a warning flag.This is a deceptive practice, and I wish DVD distributors would stop doing it."
2,Overkill...,"House of 1000 Corpses is a horror film that takes the word overkill to the literal meaning. Two college couples are on their way home to the father of one the girls when they find out about a local mass murder of innocent patients in a mental hospital decades ago. Their curiosity wants to take them to the tree where the killer, Dr. Satan, was hanged, but instead their car breaks down. Soon they find themselves among insane people who practice witchcraft, cannibalism, and murder for pleasure. As a cinematic experience this film offers some interesting shots, cinematography, and editing, but this too seems to be driven to overkill and makes the story a feast in repetitious carnage. Thus, the story seems lost, but the violence keeps the audience's attention due to its graphic and abnormally painful nature."
1,An Embarassment to Horror Movies,"The only way that a person could actually like this movie is if that person was on heroine. This movie is pathetic, and I encourage NO ONE to see it! It makes no sense whatsoever, and it is just plain stupid! Rob Zombie is a crackhead and shouldn't be allowed to make movies, because he really sucks at it! DO NOT see this movie! This movie doesn't even deserve one star. It deserves no stars at all, it's THAT bad! I am offended and embarrassed as a die hard horror movie fan that this movie was even allowed to be released, because it gives horror a bad name! Rob Zombie, go back to making music, you are a pathetic director!!!!!!!"
1,Nothing but garbage...,"This movie was like a bad dream that I couldn't wake up from. ""House of 1000 Corpses"" was nothing but shock and gratuitous gore at every turn. There was no discernable plot, no decent dialog and few characters worth remembering and the longer I watched this dog, the more upset I got. After an hour or so, I turned it off, not knowing (or even caring) if I was close to the end or not. I want my $20 back, Rob! Flush this turd and check out The Texas Chainsaw Massacre instead."
2,Could Have Been Better,I just saw the movie and am not thrilled. The first half was okay but towards the end it struggled. Rob Zombie tried to hard to go beyond the norm and gross the [...]out of you. It just became stupid. The very end though was a cool twist. Not your typical plot or characters. WARNING: Graphic torture and satanic rituals. NOT FOR EVERYONE!
1,A WASTE OF 90 MINUTES! YOU'LL WANT YOUR MONEY BACK!,"I'll make this short and simple. This movie was horrible. I love horror films, and am a Rob Zombie fan as well, which is why I gave the movie a try. I left the theater feeling like I have just spent the worst 90 minutes of my life. ..."
1,"Been there, done that... only more boring","I think my title post pretty much describes this snore fest, notice not ""gore fest"". Gore? What gore? I know ol Rob was paying homage to campy old movies, but gawd man, come up with at least a new angle. This is a direct ""rip-off"" of Texas Chainsaw franchise and some zombie movies. All done before and not even remotely scary. Thank god I got to borrow this from my library, but in my estimation is a complete waste of my time, money and the DVD is was printed on. I fast forwarded so often (because it was BORING), It only destroyed about an hour of my life.I also am not one of those snobs. I love B movies and horror movies, but this was just a plain waste of time.I WANT MY TIME BACK!!!"
3,Good Comprehensive text book,"This is a comprehensive text book covering the history, equipment, and skills of archery. It also includes information on target and field sports as well as hunting and physical conditioning. One complaint is that it reads like a college text book and the pictures are black and white. I had hoped for more and bigger pictures illustrating techniques. This book is for adults. Kids will be bored with it. It is extremely detailed, but sometimes hard to read with sentences like ""The remaining three fingers are placed or 'hooked' on the bowstring at or slightly past the first or distal interphalangeal joints of your fingers."" Overall you can't complain about a lack of information. You just might wish it were faster and lighter reading."
3,Book Review of Archery,"The book Archery is an excellent book for all levels of archers. It has a large variety of step-by-step photographs emphasizing the key skills of the sport. It also covers the equipment, techniques, and rules for all kinds of types of archery competition rounds. Practice drills are shown step-by-step to help one learn quickly. It has many special sections on different types of bows and bow hunting. Archery covers the basic and advanced skills, allowing you to master the techniques at the speed you see fit. Many pictures and diagrams help explain the material and its procedures."
4,Great animal story!,"Loved this book! When a little cow wants to get a bike, his dad tells him that he can't have it until pigs fly, so he and his friends set out to make that a reality. This children's book has an original story line and the illustrations make the book special. They are colorful and bright and hep the child to imagine what is going on in the story. I thought the end of this book was wonderful and I loved the theme of having to work hard for what you want throughout the book. The lesson that nothing is impossible if you want it bad enough was an important lesson for kids. I highly recommend this book!"
4,Wonderful Illustrations,"I bought this for my two year old who is infatuated with helicopters. He's not very interested in the text, which may be a bit long for a two year old, but isn't otherwise overly verbose, but he LOVES the pictures. Good book. I would recommend it for an older child however."
1,ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ,"From ""acclaimed"" UIC professor, Cris Mazza comes this literary cesspool. Like biting into a juicy apple pie and finding a severed thumb in it. P-U it stinks!!!0 stars would be more like it."
5,A Classic,"I own this DVD set. Perhaps this Soap Opera is more close to real life than anything we have here in the states. One of the reasons it did make as much of a hit as it did is explained nicely on the DVD. It was with Ken fixing a bike in the living room..........being watched by a young man ......fixing a bike in the living room.Even to this day the people on the street are just people. Hair dressers, cab drivers, shop keepers, cafe owners and barkeeps. In fact the only *rich* person is Mike Baldwin and all he owns is a *Knicker* factory!I was fortunate to be living in England and seeing this program while I was there and again once I returned home on the CBC from Canada (only 6 months behind :))on my big satillilte dish. You can still *watch* it on the computer by going to the ITV website.And I do. There is even a fan site that does catch up back stories and Glenda Young does not only an accurate one, but with humor.This set is well worth the having for any Corrie fan."
5,A treat for die-hard Corrie fans,"This is a Corrie collector's item. The original episodes are an absolute treat for those who remember Coronation Street in its early days. The Anniversary DVD is very interesting and enjoyable and the early episodes are priceless. This is a ""must have"" for lovers of Coronation Steet."
4,Great Stuff,"Nice collection of tunes in a more traditional vein. If you know the Crusaders, but don't have any Jazz Crusaders, this CD is for you!"
1,"cheap,but didn't last long","I bought because it was cheap,but it didn't last long and I think it gunked up the heads. Got rid of the Lexmark,when I found a good deal on a brother laser printer at Walmart"
3,Weak entry in an otherwise good series,"Catherine's desperation for a child sends her and Edgar on pilgrimage to Campostela, as one fellow pilgrim after another turn up dead and Solomon is fascinated with a repentant prostitute. But when a hate-filled priest determines that Solomon is responsible and two knights accuse Hubert of the murders, Catherine's academic curiosity takes a more urgent turn.Although it kept me reading, I can't say I really liked the book. Everyone is obsessed with themselves, and there are just too many unlikable characters and too much soap opera. Newman did fool me as to whodunit, but the title had nothing to do with the story."
5,By far the best,"I read Friberg's translation, along with every other available one in English, as research for my picture book retelling ""The Maiden of Northland."" Friberg's was simply the best, by far."
4,Fantastic covers & party....,"I can't even remember how I bought this cd back in the 90's. I've always loved this cd- great cd for putting on in the background at a party- funny thing is... this is a great stand-alone album. They do great covers, the production and sound quality is great and there's little parts inbetween each song where a special guest (Letterman included) stops by to say ""hi"". You always hear the crowd in the background between songs partying- it's fantastic. No kidding- Paul & the boys really ROCK some of the covers bigtime! It's a great mix of rock, funk, motown & slow songs too. Great fun."
4,A Great Read...,"What a ride! Scott's story drew me in immediately with his vivid, imaginative characters. He's a wonderful story-teller who has basically created a whole new language in conveying this wonderderful fantasy. A terrific read for kids of all ages!"
4,Great Book if You're A New Learner,Good beginning book. Has some on strumming/etc. Will help you learn to read tab/music. Good companion for starting to figure things out. Find a buddy and pick and play.
4,A very good product!,"I'm very happy with the screens I purchased. I have to expand them to their full length in order to completely fill my apartment window, but the screens hold together well even when fully open. The screens aren't the sturdiest items I've ever seen, but with a little care they'll work fine and give you no trouble. The shipping was fast and the screens were well-protected within the shipping carton. These screens work well and, for the price, are a great bargain!"
2,slightly damaged during shipping,"I will echo the previous reviewer's sentiment to say that this item was damaged during shipping. The metal frame was slightly bent but the item is still usable, so I didn't bother returning it. This problem could have been prevented if the packaging had been better: it arrived sealed inside a flattened-out cardboard box, with no padding to prevent the screen or flimsy metal frame from being damaged."
3,The shipping time was a major disappointment,"I don't know what happened to the storm/screen combination for room for which I ordered this screen. I think it was damaged in the previous house painting years ago. I know I will be replacing the window in the future but I thought that for short term use, the particular room needed a temporary screen.I waited and waited for this item to ship from the manufacturer.WeeksBy the time it arrived, it was only needed for another month before being taken out due to colder weather.I think it needs a gasketing around the edges to make a better seal.What am I saying? It needs gasketing to make a seal or the entire purpose is defeated."
1,A poor remake,This movie does not have the right to call itself George White Scandals. The George White Scandals was a top notch variety show and the 1934 movie of that name described the show quite well indeed. This version is hackneyed and grossly unfunny. The only worth while portion is the organ playing done for a couple of minutes. I have a VAST collection of the early films. This one is so bad I gave it away.Dale Wynn
2,Not wonderful,"While Passport for 2000 Client allowed me to pass easily by itself, this book did not seem to give enough detail, and I had to read another book before feeling ready to pass the test. I highly suggest either combining this book with another, or choosing a single more detailed book."
2,This book is only for experts who want to pass the exam,"If you are a newbie or a medicore, do not buy this book. The book only summarizes topics which will be covering for the exam. For example, it explains Active Directory in ten pages. If you are an expert on Windows 2000, you don't really need this book. All you need to do is go to cramsession.com and download the pdf file for this exam. If you are not an expert, it will not be enough for your study and you end up to buy another book."
4,still His Best song,"Ginuwine is one of those Cats that has been around now for a few minutes&yet not many of His Songs have had any lasting impression on Me,but this Song still holds up really well.I still say Arguably His Best song thus far&the only song that He has hit with that balances out His vocals."
1,Don't use this book for Precalculus,"Bottom line this book is horrible. It's very difficult to grasp their ""conversational"" style of teaching. Math requires good concreate examples with clear defined steps. This book does neither. The goal of the authors was to use a conversational writing style, I must say this approach has failed."
4,A fascinating journey,"A Healer's journey is the fascinating story of Sree Chakravarti, from her birth to a well-to-do family, to the devotion of her adult years as a healer to all people in need. In her own down-to-earth words, she describes the challenges of her life and how they and the inspiration of Sai Baba helped turn her onto the path of healing. Intermixed are case histories of patients---my favorite portion. At the back of the book are diet and yoga suggestions for a number of the complaints she has treated over the years. I thoroughly enjoyed this book and would recommend it to anyone with an interest in alternative forms of healing and spirituality."
3,Screen,"I use this for a back window that I very seldom open, but it's nice for those few times when I do. It doesn't take up any room in the closet. It does what it says it does and seems to be well made."
1,A Dead Letter,"I read this book when it was first published, and I believed it to be a work of genius, rescuing Marxist thought from its Soviet perversions. But the truth is, even the mature ""scientific"" Marx is a total fraud, and his ideas about the progress of histrory are pure wishful thinking. Marxists just need to give up on them: they'll never work."
3,Brilliant but very dense book,I rate this book a 10 in academic brilliance but only a 3in presentation. There is no doubt that Dr.Elliot Wolfsonis a world class scholar in the field of Jewish Mysticism.However I had to wind my way through extremely densescholarship to get at the material. I unfortunatelyfind this to be an annoying trait of most books inthis genre... Overall I rate this book highly and wouldrecommend it... but be prepared to invest the time andeffort...
2,Adverstisement for the Dirty Life and Times Book,I did not appreciate the fact that this was just advertisement for the Dirty life and Times book that I just plain hate!! Give us the music of Warren Zevon and keep your propaganda to yourselves please!! The selection of love songs was poor. Warren deserves better than this !!
2,Far From His Best.....,"this is a pretty lame release. anybody familiar with Warren's work, especially his earlier classics, knows he composed and sang many beautiful love songs.why they're not on this disc is quite confusing. Only the opening track would rank among his classics. the others, I don't even know and I've been a fan since Excitable Boy.just buy the original albums.even the 'best of' that's out has a better selection of his love songs.Long live the Zevon!"
3,"Clever idea, but , , ,","O.K., you gotta give 'em credit for looking cool. But when it really comes down to it, its the sound that counts. And that's where I was a bit dissappointed. Do to the small speaker size, the sound is lacking in the low end and comes across a bit tinny. There's plenty of power behind it using the AC adapter. If you use a regular iPod through the auxillary input line, you can boost the iPod's base which helps. All in all this will be a great little cubicle filler, but don't expect it to be your primary listening source at home. And its a great attention getter sitting on your desk."
2,Compact Ipod Shuffle Speaker,"I have used the Ipod Shuffle speaker and it would be fine in a one room house, the Shuffle seems to not want to stay put in the spot where you connect it. The speaker output is not that great or good, when you play the music the speaker sound seems to vibrate and shake the Shuffle loose from the connecting point. I quess you get what you pay for, but I expected a little bit more for $50.00+. The beauty of it is the slim line, but you have nowhere to put the connecting cord if you where to carry it to work and then use the ac outlet."
3,"Project Runway, season 8 complete dvd set","I only rated this complete season 8 with 3 stars due to the fact that the judges voted the wrong person as the winner. Mondo was the best designer during the entire season, and he should have won."
5,Project Runway season 8,I love this show! as I love fashion and as I could not follow a career in that amazing world... I just can say that I really enjoy seeing all the episodes and having the latest season at home!
4,Project Runway: The Complete Eighth Season,"Love all the Project Runways because of the challenges. Season eight was not a disappointment in that respect. However, the personal traumas took a little bit too much time. I prefer to see more workroom time instead of ""me time"". I'm not that into finding out personal stuff. Recommend though, of course. I can't wait for the next one !"
5,Project Runway - Season 8,"In a flurry of feathers, swatches, bitchy and camp remarks Season 8 commences. Tim is the ever present Guardian of morality and fashion and Heidi is as wonderful as ever.Season 8 is full of characters although none as memberable as Christian Siriano, or the lovely Austin Scarlet etc . . .It has it's moments and charms and its fair amount of train wrecks . . . . If you're a fan you will love it.As Tim Gunn said in an earlier series ""I've made many mistakes at 3am"""
1,R-E-S-P-E-C-T,"Why are these people so nasty and cruel to one another? Watching them talk about people behind their backs, be rude to them in person, have ego driven diva meltdowns it all makes me SICK. Remember the lesson the director of Fashion Week taught us in Season 2? Designers should treat people with RESPECT and that over the top behavior does not belong in fashion (at which point Daniel V. makes a big point to stare Santino down). The way a few of the designers disrespects Heidi in the workroom was unforgivable! Who are these people and why arent they on meds? Get some therapy and work on yourself and try and behave like an actual human being. If I had behaved this way in public I would be mortified, die of embarrassment, etc. They're so nasty to one another that by the time we get to the runway show I'm too upset to care about the clothes."
2,Too much,"Just finished watching an episode per night of Season 8 and ultimately feel quite turned-off by the whole thing. The no-longer amusing bitchiness of Gretchen, Ivy, etc., the arrogance and superciliousness of Michael Kors and much of the manipulation and slickness of the production left us with a certain feeling of time badly spent and having been had. What was really offensive was the sadistic exploitation of poor Michael Costello and his meltdown when he lost - on and on mercilessly humiliating him and us. Ugh! Tim Gunn remains very special and endearing, but it's not enough. Sorry."
5,"Full of myth, epic stories, and imagination","The Tea Party's First Album is a mostly accoustic mix of songs that tell great stories. This has remained a trend in their music today. Though this album does not show the eastern influnence as much as ""Edges of Twighlight,"" it has international elements as well. The intrumental songs are beautiful, and the harder songs like ""The River"" and ""Raven Skies"" are very powerful. Their songs are not about breakups or love in the way so much music is today - rather they tell epic stories based on legends, mythical people, and gods and goddesses. Splendor Solis is very pagan/celtic feeling, and as you will hear with other albums, they move around the world for inspiration. This is a great start to you addiction to the Tea Party."
5,East meets West,"The Tea Party are an amazing combination of elements. With a sound that mixes Zeppelin and Doors with their own edge and top notch musicianship AND great songs, it's almost impossible not to like these guys. Especially interesting on this release was the use of some Eastern / Arabian keys in songs like 'Save Me'. They put the average ""rock band"" these days to absolute shame. Buy this CD. And look at ""Transmission"" and ""The Edges of Twilight"" too. They kick!!"
3,I love the Tea Party but this one...,"The Tea Party is one of my favorit bands i love every disc they put out. But sadly I think I am missing something with this one...""Splendor Solis"" has it's moments and you definetly see the Tea Party in an early ound here. But something really doesn't pull me in like the others. I can never really listen to it all the way through. I guess it sounds a little to primitive for me. But you may like it it's the Tea Party so it's going to be better than most things out there so give it a shot..."
4,A must get something great but way off the norm.,"This group is facinating with their lyrics and sound. Many will notice that this group is a combination of Led Zeppelin and the Doors but in their own way. They continue to amaze on each of their albums, maturing with each album. A must buy!!!"
5,amazing album,"This album is amazing. ""Winter Solstice"" is a musical masterpiece and ""In this time"" has beautiful lyrics. The Tea Party's lyrical content based on mythology is very interesting. This album is definately one of my favorites."
4,Beatles Anthology,"This book is a treasure for die-hard Beatle fans as well as anyone interested in rock n roll. The format of the book where each group member comments on different subjects from their early experiences in post-war Liverpool playing in the ""bombies"", the bombed put areas around the city to their first impressions of the U.S. works well. The reader gets a sense of the love and comradarie that helped them to become successful. The picture are great altho I found it cumbersome to keep looking back at the index since their are no captions on the pictures. It's the only criticism I have of an otherwise fine book."
5,Birthday Book,"I got this book for my sister for her 18th birthday and she's a big book lover and it's taking her awhile to read it because the book is so big and it has small print. She loves it though. She says when you read it, you can hear their voices telling a story. She's a big Beatles fan, but is still learning things she didn't already know from this book. We definitely recommend this book to all Beatles lovers."
5,Very Impressed,"I thought that this would just be a worthless coffeetable gift book, but it turned out to be great. This is a must-have for any fan of The Beatles."
1,Please release a Kindle version so I can read this book!,"Like many people I'm partially colour blind. I purchased this book years ago but ended up giving it away because I was not able to read it. Too many of the pages are in colour and I had a major problem distinguishing the type from the colour background on those pages. I was hoping that the powers that be might release a Kindle version of The Beatles Anthology but, alas, it has not happened yet. Please release a Kindle version so I can read this book!"
3,Great not Perfect,"How does one begin to discribe this book? Glorified coffee table book? That would be close but not the true discription. Someone may look at it that way simply by examining the size. It is diffiult to handle in it's current format. However, there is no way around that without cutting down the size of the pictures which are trully amazing. I also found it difficult to physically read given that the print covers multi-colored splashes of art.While I have enjoyed looking through this beautiful book, I did find it very disappointing in one aspect: where was the album history? Was it an oversite that there was no concise list of all albums released in the US and England with lyrics, comments, jacket covers, etc? I consider this a massive error.This is however a must, not only for Beatles fans but all that are interested in '60s culture and history.So, throw your Beatle CD's on the player, sit back and curl up with this wonderful but flawed book.Enjoy"
5,A must have for any true beatles fan,"Do not be deterred by the high price of this book, it is worth every penny. For everyone one of us who ever wondered exactly why did the beatles break up? how bad was John's drug problem? and who were the beatles before they were the ""Beatles""? this book finally has all the answers. The stories in this book catalogue both the personal lives and trials of all the members and also the blossoming of thier music careers (and how thier manager tried to shaft them left and right. And as if the stories were not enough, the book is filled with so many photos that don't be surprised if you have a flash back to that Beatlemania you once knew..."
5,The ultimate Beatles coffee table book,I've been a Beatles fan since they first came to America. From Ed Sullivan to their last gig on the Apple Records rooftop this book has it all. Great photos and cover artwork as well.Also recommended for Beatles fans: THE CARPET FROGS: MUSIC AFTER TOMORROW by Alan Arlt
5,It's the BEATLES for God's sake!!! Need I say more?,"This book was awesome! Their stories and their experiences from THEIR mouths (with one or two naughty stories thrown in).The pictures! So many that it must have taken me as long to study them all as it did to actually read the book.This is a must have for anyone who is as big a Beatle-freak as I am.Not to mention, Amazon's price (incl. shipping) is cheaper than any store I've seen."
4,Too big,"Its a great book, with all the pictures and stuff, but make sure you have a oversized shelf in your book shelf if you buy it.:)"
3,Ultimately..........OK,"I have been a Beatle fan for over 20 years, and maybe that's why this book just doesn't excite me that much. When compared with the Lewisohn books - Chronicles and the Recording sessions, Revolution in the Head, or even The Love You Make, this book is not nearly as insightful or exciting. Instead, the book sinks into the Beatles' myth preservation mode. Sure, I bought it because I'm a big fan and I wouldn't change that decision. It just would have been nice if it came through on the ""definitive/holy grail"" hype."
3,Massive collection of stuff,"If you have extra money, buy it. If you don't ... you're not missing anything important. Remember, it was the music that made them famous. Also a note to readers in the USA, this book could use a glossary of British slang terms used throughout this huge book."
5,FAB AND GEAR BEYOND ALL AND ANYTHING BEATLES,"I was recently hospitalized for almost 3 weeks and dreading the impending boredom, I brought the Anthology with me. I admit I've had it since the day it was released and only scanned the photo's. Well needless to say, I read that book every day and was completely blown away. My life has been the Beatles for the past 35 years and this was the freshest Beatle experience I have ever had. The fabs have been reborn unto me and I can only say you will have the best Beatles experience in your life. (Unless of course you've seen them live)"
5,Amazing,"Everything I hoped for and more! Amazing book! Filled with so much info.. Definitely recommend this purchase, its worth every penny!"
4,Good For Those Who Don't Know Much About The Band,"For those like me who have read this stuff a thousand times, the book wasn't a revelation. The photos were very good, and there were even some that I hadn't seen.The narritatives by the Beatles themselves were a bit dissapointing and didn't probe nearly enough into the personalities of each Beatle.For example, we never did hear what Harrison thought about McCartney as a person, a musician, a songwriter, etc. What did Paul think about Ringo as a drummer, Harrison or Lennon as guitarists, etc? What kind of music would they have made had they stayed together?I would have preferred some really insightful comments, but the photography made it worth four stars."
5,Eileen D,"I've been following the Beatles since I was sixteenback in 1964. Wow, after 47 years of collecting books,magazines, newspaper articles, buying all their music onrecords, cassettes, cds, etc., if I was to recommend oneitem to purchase besides their music, this book woulddefinitely be at the top of this list. It's absolutelythe very best!!"
5,Anthology: Extraordinary Book,"What can I say about this book? What can't I say about this book, I am 17 years old, and not many people in my school are as big Beatles fans as me and my friend Rich are. But I brought this book to school with me everyday and read it. People would say they didnt like the Beatles, but if I play a song for them, chances are they have heard it, and like it. So I have let a couple friends who weren't Beatles fans borrow my book. And every one of them loved it. I will read this book again and again, for a long time. If you like the Beatles now, or have ever liked them, you will want to get this book. It's loaded with stories behind the music, and lyrics, and tales of their childhood. Along with many many pictures, this huge book covers the entire career of the Beatles rise to the top from Liverpool."
5,A must-have!!!,"I have not yet finished this book - I'm savoring it page by page. It is stunning! Beautifully laid out, and the photos are wonderful - there's quite a few I've never seen before. My only disappointment was seeing so much of the video anthology dialogue repeated here but there is ALOT more added as well. Highly recommended by this Beatles fan!"
5,Great gift -- great book!,"I gave this book as a Christmas gift and it is superb. The quality of the book, as well as the pictures and text is excellent. She was delighted with the book (and I was delighted with the price too). Very interesting -- with lots of facts that I hadn't heard before."
4,Huge Fan has Slight Disappointment,"Hello to all fellow fansI bought this book the day it came out, and excitedly began to read as soon as I got home. However, I found more joy that first day flipping through and looking at the (wonderful) photographs than actually reading, and I continue to feel the same way. As interesting as these different points of view and recollections are, the book becomes rather monotonous after 150 or so pages. I ended up skipping to commentaries on my favorite albums rather than reading from cover to cover. I would recommend this book to any avid fan, but if you're simply looking for a good read, I suggest you search elsewhere. (Don't take this wrong and think I don't like the music, because the Beatles albums are my favorite.)Love it anyway - Angela"
2,Too Heavy!!,"You will need a strong coffee table for this 10 pound monster. Don't plan on reading it in bed. It's just too uncomfortable to pick up, sorry."
2,This ain't the Beatles I remember,"I'm very disappointed in the format, writing and graphics. What a shame to spend $60 (cover price) on such redundant, poorly designed rubbish. What happen to the creativity the Fab Four once had?"
3,Enough already,"Yes, yes, yes: they were the greatest pop band of all time. But does that really mean we have to be constantly reminded of the fact? Please say that we dont.Anyone of you under 30 (who have had enough of ageing hippies telling us that todays music is 'rubbish') should save their $ and discover something truly exciting. New Music! If the fab four taught us anything, it was to always search for something new. So go out and buy some Beck/Chemical Brothers/Mogwai/Michael Nyman/whatever: just dont buy the feel-good-cash-in-revisionist-history-overpriced book that will follow in its footprints in about, oh, 30 years time.Great music mind."
2,Close but no cigar,"This novel doesn't know what it wants to be when it grows up. Gangster crime? Alienation philosophy? Bottom-of-the-pit coming of age? In the end, it doesn't matter, because the book is too dreary to live.This is a depressing story: grim, ugly, bleak, stark, violent, loveless, empty. It sinks itself in its morass of betrayal, savagery, torture and slaughter. And I warn you, it leaves a nasty aftertaste.Does he have writing chops? Yes, indeed. He's got a fresh way with words, great atmospherics, humor and, although he muddles a bit between tenses, and sometimes prattles on beyond the worth of the passage, he's reasonably clear. But who cares? -- the story is not worth reading."
1,"Pure rubbish,.....","I was referred to Adrian Mckinty by a friend who claimed if I liked John Sanford, James Lee Burke, Lee Childs etc... I would enjoy the works of Adrian McKinty. I didn't. I got halfway through Dead I may well be and frankly that's exactly how I felt while reading the book. I was never able to find a zone as this author was all over the board, often times simply ranting about with no discerable point or purpose. Not to mention I don't particularly enjoy authors that repeatedly let me know what's going to happen later in the book. It's like going to the movies with some bloke who constantly tells you ahead of time what's going to happen because he's seen it 3 times already. I'll stay with the tried and true authors,...."
5,Terrific Tour de Force,"A thriller that is history, fantasy, poetry and a portrait of New York as well, woven together as a very original, innovative page turner that makes one think and also keeps the adrenalin going."
4,Dead I well may be,This book contains an excellent first chapter. You can just taste Harlem in the 90s and all that goes with it. The middle and end bits are pretty strong too! - particulalry the Epliogue which was a bonus. McKinity seems to have really enjoyed himself writing this harsh but beautiful novel. Well worth exploring - he seems to have been born to write.
4,Very satisfying read,"Definitely worth picking up. The only real flaws I found, which weren't integral to the plot but should not happen in ""crime"" novels, were gun mistakes. For instance, revolvers dont have safeties. Other than that, entertaining and well written."
4,Very stylish writing,"The first thing that you notice about ""Dead I Well May Be"" is Michael Forsyth's voice. He's witty, mordant, and a bit wistful about how things in his life might have been different. Michael's such a great character that I'd recommend reading this book no matter what the plot. The plot itself is no great shakes -- it's not bad, as such, but you'll know where it's going long before it gets there.Still, I'd rather read 100 books that are as well-written as this one than read a twisty turny novel with all the depth of a puddle of water. (FWIW, I've started reading the next novel, ""Dead Yard"", and it's much less predictable; I highly recommend it as well).Incidentally, I listened to the recording of the book, and I highly recommend it."
3,3.5 Stars - Well written,"This is a tough book for me to evaluate. It saddened me as the character of Michael is young and highly intelligent, yet seemingly unwilling to leave the violent life he's living. It is brutal, filled with profanity and violence, but wonderfully written. If you can deal with the first two, it's worth reading for the writing alone."
5,Hmmm...,"Apparently, I can't use the eff word every other sentence and still be heard so I guess I'll clean it up this time around. This book is so legitimate, it's basically amazing to the point where you'll never forget it. I read this book years and years ago and I didn't know that it was part of a trilogy but I was still happy with it! But like chinese food it left a gnawing growing hunger deep in my soul and upon further investigation after years of craving i found there was more to be had. basically here it is: this book is gritty, and funny, and glorious and if you don't read it you will have a paperback shaped hole in your life."
3,Good Questions. As for answers....,"This movie is very well made and enjoyable to watch.It appropriately raises questions related to the fundamental complexity of life and justifiably questions the holes in Darwin's theory. However, it is not handled scientifically. They work to discredit Darwin when he was merely trying to explain what he observed. When Einstein extended our understanding of physics, there was not a ""Relativity Movement"" working to debunk Isaac Newton. There was no need and if Newton had been alive, he probably would have been gratified to see new information carry forward the body of knowledge.This movie correctly states the problem and then asserts an answer without scientific means of justifying it. It's fine philosophy. It's just not theory. I recommend watching it and then consider whether you care about the answer to the question. Science doesn't care what the answer is... it just works to find one."
5,First Rate Presentation,"Not only a valuable discussion about Intelligent design, but also a greatly informative presentation about Irreducible Complexity.Top notch production without being dumbed down; Ockham would be proud!"
5,Marvelous,"Our entire family watched this and we all enjoyed it very much and we learned a lot as well. The photography is terrific, the information and ideas fascinating and compelling.I find it puzzling that anybody who watched the video would say they don't address any evolutionary arguments more recent than Darwin. To the contrary, more than one much more recent scientific theory was discussed and refuted. For instance, Chemical Predestination is much more recent, and they not only discuss it, they have the original author of the book explaining why he had to discard his theories of evolution when the science didn't support them."
5,"Well done video, a MUST see.","It is said a picture is worth a thousand words, and this video is worth a million words. The science looks sound me and the critics just seem to be resorting to name calling, and have no scientific counter argument. Anyone with an open mind is going to find this video enlightening. This video paints a good picture of how mathematically improbable biological evolution really is. A little like putting a bullet into a million different boom boxes and expecting one of them will be an improved boom box. Some evolutionists confuse changes brought about by natural selection and genetic diversity, and then call that evolution, when it only proves adaptation. It is certainly a valid scientific endeavor, to explore the possibility that biological systems came about as a result of intelligent design, rather than random chance. The real question is why do some people view the idea of an intelligent design so undesirable? Why not see where the evidence leads?"
5,Jesus Christ made us,"I encourage everyone who does not believe in Jesus Christ as their Lord and Savior to ask the Lord to prove it to you. The Lord is more real than what you may think. He made us all, loves us all, and died and rose from the grave for our sins so that we may live eternally with him. Repent from your sins and call upon the name of the Lord and you will be saved."
4,good product and speedy delivery,"I received the ""Unlocking the Mystery of Life"" DVD in excellent condition inside a nice DVD case before the estimated shipping date. Speedy shipping. As a biochemist, I found the video to be a scientifically accurate and convincing case for intelligent design."
1,A pile of crap,"every claim Behe has made has been refuted in peer reviewed journals. Call him what ever you what just don't call him a scientistoh an by the way, Why do whales have genes for legs? if birds did not come from reptiles then why do birds have genes for teeth? why do humans have genes for tails?"
3,Give me a Break,"I currently live in New York; but while reading other people's responses to the video, I felt like I was in Pulaski, TN(where the KKK was formed). How ignorant can you get? Philosophically, the video's importance in the examination of creation is very significant, but the theories it suggests are pathetic. Just like any culture throughout history which has encountered something confusing and inexplicable, these scientists(if they're still even worthy of that title) have done the unthinkable. They have suggested a theory of 'intelligent design' because they are incapable of discovering a truly scientific originof life. ""Well, this Double-Helix [stuff] is way to complicated for me. I know! Maybe GOD designed it, and since He's perfect, I'm not meant to completely understand it."" Give me a break!"
1,Making a mockery of the mystery of life and of God.,"As an Australian I find it difficult to imagine anybody watching this pseudo science without laughing. Americans on the other hand seem to enjoy deluding themselves for some higher purpose. I wouldn't have written a review had I not been misled into thinking that this was a science DVD. It is not. If you are a devout muslim, jew or christian watch it with your kids and have them comment on the fallacies and poor reasoning - just for kicks. A waste of money otherwise."
1,Rubbish,More of the same rubbish from the lunatic fringe who deny the scientific evidence of evolution. Watch only for more of the same perverse entertainment trotted out by these morons.
2,Literary chewing gum,"I clicked on the review button for the book ""Regarding Ducks & Universes"" but somehow it got credited to the DVD ""Unlocking The Mysteries Of Life"" . This DVD was Great ( 5 stars) , the book was as mentioned in the title, just chewing gum for the mind, and old chewing gum at that. The review that follows applies to the book, not the DVD. Sorry for the confusion.This book is well written and the concept is interesting for fans of SciFi . After reading half the book I began to lose interest and couldn't figure out why but eventually realized the story moved at such a slow pace that there must not be enough basic story line to move it any faster. This is mental chewing gum for sci- fi fans but little more. Just not enough substance to justify the reading time."
1,Non-scientific claptrap,"How can other reviewers call this material ""compelling science"", when 99.86% of scientists engaged in the life sciences believe that this is pseudo-scientific claptrap? Including Christian scientists?"
2,Mystery of Life & The priviledged Plant,I was not really into these movies. Too biological and mundane.
5,Unlocking The Mystery Of Life,Great video. What I liked is that gives you both sides of the story and you can make up your mind what you want to believe.
5,Unlocking the Mystery of Life,"An excellent DVD, detailing the superb design of living things, which can only by that of an intellect so advanced that the existence of God is beyond debate."
5,Design case well documented,"Lots of footage, but the narration is even better. Really great case for design. The quality is very good and plays well in both player and computer. Promptly delivered to Military Post Office outside the USA."
5,Divine creation,This is truly educational as well as further proof that Darwin had it all wrong. Thank you Heavenly Father for giving intelligence to humans to realize that we were created by you
5,FOLLOW THE EVIDENCE WHEREVER IT LEADS!!!,"Excellent source of information for the theory of intelligent design (ID). The video provides clear and easy to understand arguments for ID and points out the gaps in evolutionary theory that cannot account for the origin-of-life on earth. The video includes interviews with leading scientists and scholars from various fields of expertise. The video also provides some historical information about Charles Darwin and his journey on the HMS Beagle. It is packed with beautiful scenes of wildlife that make it entertaining as well as educational. The bonus features include a question and answer section, library references, web links, and biographical sketches about each scientist/scholar. This is a must have for all of those who are interested the origin-of-life argument and those that declare to follow the evidence wherever it leads. I would strongly recommend this for all adults and students at the high school level and above."

1,Useless...,"I wish someone would have left a review before I bought this kit...I'm going to let you know a little secret about jetting...USE THE STOCK JETS...I ordered this kit for my 2006 Honda 450 trx atv, and this kit is useless...I have since had to order new jets from Keihin...Just some advice, save yourself your money and spend the $2.61 and buy the single jet from Keihin..."
1,Super Crappy.,"Ok, enough already! Whats the deal with people from the mid-west and crappy horror movies with people too big to run away. Bad soundtracks with there stoner friends, that ALWAYS seem to have a UN-origional idea to make the whole crappy soundtrack. And everyone is too dumb to dumb to know wth editing and sound mixing are. Save your money guys, don't bother."
2,Poor choice for anyone studying Spanish.,"This textbook is a poor choice for anyone studying Spanish. There are too many mistakes and due to these mistakes, Spanish language students will suffer the consequences by not having the correct information. The layout of the book is also confusing. Vocabulary lists are provided at the end of each chapter. This means that anyone who is working on a particular exercise must constantly page back and forth. There are also a lot of grammatical elements that appear in exercises which students have yet to cover, thereby leaving the student confused and misguided. The glossary is also poorly designed. Anyone using a foreign language textbook should be able to look in the glossary for vocabulary that had been covered in the book. Instead, one must refer back to the chapter in which the vocabulary appeared. Such a task has proven to be fruitless and exasperating. Why make the process of learning and studying a foreign language more difficult than it already is?"
5,THE BEST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! GET IT!!!,....THIS SERIES WAS THE BEST!!! I RECOMEND THIS TO ANY FANSASTY VAMPIRE FAN!!! And if you are a yaoi fan this is for you.... there is only 13 eposides but they are all great. Trust me...get this anime.
3,Not the original album,"Fans should be aware that this is *not* the original Ovation label album, ""Just Like Real People,"" from 1979. This is a ""best-of"" sampler, with only eight songs. (DJ Joe Sixpack, Slipcue Guide To Country Music)"
5,History at its best,"This book is so engrossing that I read the whole thing at a single sitting, well into the night! The author does a superb job of immersing the reader into the stories of the parallel protagonists, both the Confederate and Union teams, until the pivotal battle between them. This author has the rare gift of making the personalities and the time come alive again and he has the solid nautical background to help the reader understand the context of these technologies and the men that made them come about. If you have any interest at all in history, buy this book - you won't regret it."
4,Monitor rules..but barely!,"Really this effort deserves more than 4 stars but maybe not a 5. Still he does a great job here covering nearly every aspect of what was a major technical and historical development. He covers all the major characters on both sides, it is in fact a very well-balanced account. The book could certainly have used a better map to show the Hampton Roads area and exactly where the events took place, the one in the paperback book is plain inadequate. It was hard to tell from the narrative and maps why exactly the Virginia was trapped by the land actions and could not escape. I have a brand new appreciation for what it took to create these ships, get them to battle (1 day apart!)and how it truly revolutionary they were!"
