3,happy signs dvd,"This video's graphic are poor and the selection of words taught is minimal. good for a starter video, not worth the price I paid for it. I bought the used one even."
2,Not Worth it for Experienced Signers,"I got this DVD for my kids, 14 months and 7 years b/c my BFF is deaf and so is her child. I was hoping it would make learning sign more ""fun"" for them. But the video was very boring and didn't teach us anything we didn't already know. I think it would be great for just talking to your hearing baby, but if you are actually wishing to learn how to communicate with a deaf person then this DVD is worthless."
4,baby enjoys it,Baby really enjoys this one and has learned to sign hat from two viewings. I think because of the cartoon characters and the amount of repetition not found in other sign videos the happy signs is a series i would purchase more of. FYI The sign for drink in this video is slightly different than in other videos we have.
3,Not bad,"The dvd is a little short for the money spent. The information that is on the dvd is fine,it just could be longer and contain more sign language. ! Our child seems to like the DVD."
2,Not that great for the money,"I bought this for my 2 1/2 year old with special needs and it really didn't capture her interest for long. They didn't teach as many signs as I had anticipated either. If it had cost a little less it may have been worth it. The inclusion of animation was a good idea, it was helpful in keeping my daughter engaged for a little while. I wouldn't recommend it though."
2,DONT BUY IT,I AM DEAF/HEARING IMPAIRED MOTHER OF TWIN BOYS 18 MONTHS(HEARING)THE VIDEO SEEMS TOO LONG FOR ONE WORDS AT A TIME I KINDA GREW IMPAITENT AND MY BOYS DOESNT SIT STILL WATCHING IT. THEY ARE OTHERDVD I LOVE IS My Baby Can Talk - First Signs. THEY LEARNED FOUR SIGNS IN ONE DAY.... AWESOME!
4,"Obnoxiously repetitive, but baby likes it","This was obnoxious repetitive and the woman's voice is a little irritating, but my baby does seem interested in it because of the animals and animation. I am not sure the signs are all ASL. Some of the differ from other ASL DVD's I have, like My Baby Can Talk DVD's. Those get 5 stars all the way!"
1,Poorly packaged,I ordered the tray as a gift. It arrived with the glass bottom broken. Very poorly packaged. No time to return before I need to present the gift so I now have to go out and purchase a glass bottom for the tray. Amazon doesn't have a link for me to express my displeasure and request an adjustment. I have provided feedback on the packaging link. To receive an adjustment I can only return the item (which I don't have time to do). Amazon is great as long as everything arrives undamaged but not so great if you receive a damaged item.
3,good somethimes,"This item worked good for about 3 weeks then would work when it wanted to.. I emailed the company and with no problem they sent me another mister/LED (minus the bowl) but the new element is working good now. The other problem with this unit was the switch to turn it on and off. The wire came off and I had to re-solder the wire so it would work again. So far, other than the above, it is working fine. My fingers are crossed hoping it will not break in some other way. When working it is very nice!!"
3,So-so.,"Eh, that's it? I've listened to this a few times and just can't get into it. Christian music has enough warbly ballads and mellow stuff. If I hadn't gotten and listened to ""Superhero"" before this CD, I would never have bought it. (Usually, it's a band's sophomore effort that stinks! But, in S&T's case it's the next one which peels the paint off the walls.) The production quality is very good. It doesn't sound too echoey or pre-packaged. The singing's good, but I'm not sure what their style is? All in all, skip past this one and buy ""Superhero""."
5,"Great on Record, Great Live","This CD is great. It really makes me proud that I'm a Christian. I was fortunate enough to hear Scarecrow and Tinmen play at a youth rally, and they rocked the place. They're right up there with my other favorite Christian Rock band, MxPx."
5,THIS CD IS AWESOME!!!!!,For anyone who likes pop rock music must get this cd.The songs are great and the message is excelent.This cd is fresh and cool I LOVE IT!!!!!!
5,Christian rock is awesome!,"I saw this band live in 2000, and I have been a fan ever since. I love the themes and messages in their music, and the way they arrange their music is fantastic. This is one of their older works, but I had to rebuy it when I couldn't find my old copy. Now it is digitally immortalised in my iPod!"
4,This WILL Infiltrate Your Brain,"The first time I saw Alfie I was at another band's show. They were nothing like anything I've seen before! But after they'd finished I still wasn't sure. By the third time I 'bumped' into them going to see other bands I realised just how good these guys are. I found myself not only recognising every song but LOVING every song.They are best described as Folk-Rock and are well suited to the stools they occupy live. This swagger and faux-unproffesionalism comes across as on this recording to produce a relaxing, beautiful marriage of vocals, lyrics and most certainly the music. They are diverse and skilled musicians who can easily crowd a stage with vocals, guitars, bass, cello(?), drums, flute and trumpet.If you want comparisons they're hard to classify, but I suppose they sound like Turin Brakes without the vocal harmonies. Just buy it and listen - especially to 'All About the Weather' and 'Make No Bones'."
3,Not bad...considering the price,"These stools are cheap, but in this case you get slightly more than you pay for.They put together pretty easily but there were two problems:#1. One of the chairs lacked the hardware so I had to purchase the screws and bolts at Lowe's.#2. One of the chairs had a broken piece on one of the feet.Now you would think that after all that I would rate this chair lower. However, after asking the company to send me another foot, they just sent me a whole other new chair. I guess with products at this price point, it's not worth tracking down just one piece.Overall - if you're on a budget then consider buying. Just know that there may be problems and that these really aren't made for daily use (IMO)."
5,Great,Perfect for the price. I was surprised for sure.. not much more else to say. Not sure how to describe with twenty words but I suppose this will do.. they are barstools and cheap and black and easy to put together.
2,You get what you pay for,Chairs are cheap and some parts didn't fit correctly. We completely removed the back off of one of the chairs because one of the bars was to short. I thought i would try them out for the price but i wouldn't buy them again. I recommended to the seller that they should not sell low quality items like this. Don't waste your money!
2,You get what you pay for,"These bar stools are about the cheapest ones available - both in price and quality. Construction quality is lacking. Not real sturdy either. They crush under the weight of a heavier person, which is not good and not safe. I purchased 5 sets of two, and about half of them had missing parts or defects. If you are looking for the least expensive option, this is probably the best choice. I would not recommend these or purchase any more."
1,Wish I could give no stars....,"These chairs are horribly constructed.First off you can literally bend the frame, and you have to in order to put them together....If that doesn't deter you the chairs are not level due to the bending of the frame and the screws provided are not long enough to screw down the cushion. Not a huge deal, but an unnecessary trip to the hardware store.I bought a set of these chairs about 4 years ago now. They have changed the design on them somewhat, the back is now more rounded and you have to put the back support together your self now. It is no longer welded together, this was the area I had to literally bend when I was putting them together.Very cheap, and the design has worsened which is not surprising since the Chinese design for money rather than design for improvement. Save your money, these chairs are worth at most 10 bucks each."
4,black bar stools,"My wife and I recently purchased these two bar stools. They came as described with no shipping delays. They were easy to assemble and look very good. However, they measure 29 inches and are not adjustable so be sure to measure the height of your bar as they might be a little low to sit comfortably at the bar especially if you are under 5 foot 4 inches in height as my wife is. overall, a great value for the money!"
3,dissapointed,"The chairs have many marks or chips on them, i will have to use touch up paint to hide the metal that is showing. They look like they were used and repackaged. The shipping is so damn high that i fear spending way too much money sending them back."
1,I am not happy..,I buyed in Jan..its toooo bad quailty..My family is not happy..I am not gng to buy again from this company..
3,Good Deal but you may want to look around more,"Pros:Inexpensive (less than $50 shipped for 2 stools)look nice and are tall enough for my bar countersCons:Backrest is uncomfortable and hard - needs pillowGetting the huge oddly sized merchandise out of box filled with shipping popcornNeed to assemble both, slightly difficult - takes about half an hour"
2,Cheap stools,"I got these and everything was great until a few months in somehow they all got broken from normal sitting. I guess maybe I gained weight? Anyway these are very flimsy, and I have had three broken from normal sized people sitting on them normally. I won't buy anymore of these because they are not adequate for my everyday needs."
3,"Product is not bad, company leaves a lot to be desired!","The product is worth the price. Nice, fairly sturdy and easy to put together. However, I ordered three sets, one of which showed up without a problem, one of which showed up battered and bruised and one that showed up a complete mess.The one that showed up just beat up had all the parts and worked out fine. Now the problem! The one that showed up severely damaged was missing the assembly parts and missing the caps for the legs, needed so the chair sits level and don't scratch the floor.It is now going on two months and after numerous e-mails back and forth I received the parts for one of the chairs in the box, I AM STILL WAITING FOR THE PARTS FOR THE OTHER CHAIR. I have been repeatedly told they mailed them, but, NO PARTS!If you can get the chairs somewhere else, get them."
4,Not bad,The stools hold up well and seem supportive for the average weight. I had a hard time with attaching the cushion using a screwdriver. It might be best to use a drill to get the screws to go directly into the wood underneath. The directions are not the best because they are all images and no text. I like the back rest though and they swivel very nicely. It's great being able to buy two at once.
4,PALLADIUM Men's Freiburg,"A little bit heavier than expected. Also, it's a little bit larger than my usual size 10 shoes. But overall great shoe. Good design and comfortable"
4,Great Reference,I like this book. I use it a lot when I read different texts. It does help to completely understand what I am reading.
3,Good Speakers...but,These are great speakers however after about 6-months the power saver kept kicking in causing the unit to shut off every minute or so...even when plugged in. I replaced them and so far so good. Sound quality is pretty good and the compactness allows you to easily take them on the road.
5,Great quality,"+ Great sound quality+ Powerfull enough to fill my living room (though probably not with 25 people in party mode) with a small footprint.- The remote requires you to point it somewhat accuretly at the speakers and is not as responsive as a remote for a tv. (Probably because the remote is tiny and only has a watch-like battery, so not enough power).Overall, very good quality for a reasonable price."
4,Decent PORTABLE speakers,"I bought these speakers several months ago, specifically for travel. If played at low volume (enough to fill a hotel room, but not loud enough to disturb someone in the next room), they do a very nice job. I use them with my iPod and with a small FM radio (to listen to NPR). They are light, easy to pack, and the sound only distorts at higher volumes. Bringing them along also saves me from packing the iPod charger...so I save a little space. Note: I have the Bose for cranking up the sound at home!"
2,Disappointed,"A few things I didn't see in the product description here are the poor compatibility with the older IPODs. e.g. my 20MB version.- The remote doesn't work properly on the older IPODs (only the volume and on/off buttons not the back/forward buttons etc.)- The older IPODs connect via a wire and balance on the system without ""locking"" properly into the system.- It doesn't charge the (older) IPOD as claimed.BTW - the instructions (as noted in the reviews by others) are just awful.Apart from that it's OK."
1,not for ipod photo,we liked the idea until we received it and it was not built to support the new apple ipod photo so we had to send it back.
1,Missed Expectations,"The sound is not nearly as good as people might have you believe. It sounds like a pair of speakers that are 4 inches tall.In addition, a design flaw is that the you cannot use the device as an external IPOD speaker set AND A DOCKING STATION at teh same time. You have to pick one or the other and discoonect the appropriate cables. Try the JBL product!"
4,IT WAS GREAT,"Loved it from the first day till the last day. Sound was what I thought was very good for it's size. battery life was good. design was cool how it folds flat. traveled well. took it hundreds of places and thought it was cool each time I set up. I don't remember the price between $ 100.00 - 150.00 I think. It broke after 15 years. The on and off slide control broke.For the time it was great. Thinking back, bass and treble controls would have been nice but the I pod I was using had those setting. It's replacement is much larger and is a vizio product from sam's club. also nice but again no bass or treble control but ipod still has those setting. I don't know if they even sell this product any more. If they did and the price has gone down to $ 40.00 dollars I might do it all over again."
3,Altec Lansing Support Sucks!,"I bought the Altec Lansing inMotion IM3CBLK in March 08. Shortly after I purchased it, one of the battery covers on the back of the unit fell off and was lost while I was traveling. I contacted support thinking they could just send me a replacement battery cover. To my suprise, I needed to send the entire unit in for the battery cover to be replaced. What a ridiculous waste of money for them. At any rate, it is now October 11, 2008 and I still haven't received my unit back. I keep contacting support and each time it's a different excuse. I am considering a Bose unit now and am done with Altec Lansing. Too bad, I really liked their products but not worth the pain should it break. I suppose you could consider these disposable units. Buyer beware."
3,Sacrifice sound quality for portability & trendiness...,"OK, these are certainly better than those pathetic Bose iPod speakers that cost over twice as much---no surprise there, Bose is just one huge hype/marketing scam.The question you need to ask yourself is, however, do you REALLY need this much compactness and portability?Sure these speakers sound fine...if you are sitting within about 3 feet of them and have them at moderate volumes only, that is.If you want more room-filling sound you're much better lugging around a pair of self-powered plug-in 2.0 or 2.1 computer speakers like the Klipsch ProMedia 2.0 or better yet find a boombox that has auxilary input plugs so you can plug your iPod into it (this may be hard to do since most boomboxes these days are so cheaply built).Otherwise to be frank, you're better off investing in a nice pair of Sennheiser headphones. Itty-bitty flat speakers look cute but if you're serious about your music they just don't cut it."
3,"Great sound and great for charging, but horrible and cryptic instructions!!!!","The sound is great and I love the fact that you can bring your iPod mini anywhere and still have a thing to charge it because I hated having to have to hook it up to my computer to charge it. The sound is great and I love listening to all of my songs in my room. So I would give the sound and charging 5 stars each!But the bad thing was the instructions. They were very cryptic and hard to figure out. It took me so long just to put the darn thing together and everything!!!! So if you're someone who doesn't read instructions or has a hard time doing so, this sound system and charger is not for you!!! I gave the instructions and putting it together 1 star because it was very hard to do!So overall, I averaged the 5's and the 1 to get 3 stars total."
3,Good Ipod Speakers,"Altec Lansing inMotion iM3 is perfect for its design and portability. The sound is not as great as I expected, but it's OK. It's pretty loud but something missing in bass and you need to adjust your ipod equalizer if you are a serious music listener(sound freak). Some of the songs are not clear (Electronica/Dance genre). And also remote control does not work properly. Wait until the price down to $140 and just buy it. Original price $180 bucks is not worth it. Pay extra 120 and just get Bose Ipod speaker which is not portable but has much greater sound. Or get a JBL one which is cheaper than Altec Lansing iM3."
4,"Basic, light weight, portable speakers","I bought mine for travel purposes and use the JBL On Stage more when I am at home. The JBL does sound better but I got a decent price on the Altec, it would dock and charge my ipod mini and also had the battery option. So I took it on vacation with me and it worked well but it did use 1 set of batteries per night. Thats 4 AA per night. Not exactly cheap.I think that those who complain about the lack of battery options in other speakers do not quite understand exactly how many batteries they will be using. I was out of the country but I still wish now that I wouldve taken my ""heavy"" adaptor with me. You live and learn. I guess everyone has special needs, but in this case I can tell you 1 set of 4 batteries would last only 1 night.So, these are a decent set of speakers if the price is right. Packs well for travel but dont expect mindblowing sounds as its just a tiny lightweight speaker system. Its ok, Id give it more of a 3.5 star if I could."
2,Sound is disappointing.,"I bought this product to use in my small office knowing that with the size of the speakers the sound would not be suitable for loud playing or large areas. With this in mind I have to say that I found the sound to be poor. Even with the bass turned up and the treble down it still sounded tinny and weak. I did like the fact that it accommodated my older, 1st generation iPod and had several attachments for the various versions of iPods. I bought it because it did accept my older iPod and because of the price, but I sent it back and bought the iM7 which has great sound and accepts my old iPod for a price that is not that much more."
4,Perfect for the deployed soldier,"I bought this to use with my Ipod while deployed to Iraq. It works great. I never thought the sound would be as good as it is. Also, it comes complete with every type of plug you might encounter. The only problem was that Amazon would not ship to the APO address, so I had to ship to home, then have someone ship it to me."
1,iPod photo 30G did not fit,"Great concept but... One previous review stated that the ipod photo did not fit. I found the same thing. I contacted Altec Lansing by phone and despite removing the adapter my ipod would still not sit in the dock. It seemed ""off center"" and would not seat. The tech continued to tell me that it would fit, no luck."
5,Perfect Office/Travel Stereo,"I've had this for a total of one week, and I can't imagine life without it. Absolutely perfect for an office or other smaller enclosed spaces, although I used it outside this weekend for yardwork, and it wasn't half bad. Yes, the Bose SoundDock has a richer sound (I've compared the two side by side offline), but it wasn't worth spending more than double on that device. Plus, it (the Bose) isn't as portable - this version collapses just as advertised, about the size and weight of a hardcover book. I travel a bit, and I can't wait to take this on the road.If you're in the market for an iPod stereo such as this, look no further (and no, I don't work for Altec Lansing)."
5,Great Little Product for the iPod,Just purchased this inexpensive little unit and am amazed at the sound quality for such small speakers. It does just what it's intended to do - produce a very reasonable quality of sound from a portable unit. I had no trouble at all with the remote - it turns the unit on and off and controlled the volume and the iPod from a good 10 feet away. My only real complaint is that the instructions are woeful! Altec Lansing could do well to improve their in-box instructions which are far below the quality of the unit itself. I was almost ready to return my unit initially when I discovered - only by accessing Altec Lansing's web page for the iM3 - that I had to remove the not-too-obvious plastic dock adaptor that was already in place to put in my iPod 4G 60GB photo. Otherwise it is an excellent buy in my opinion and would be extremely hard to beat for the price.
1,LSAT(Lacking Serious Academic Thought),This book is the most rediculious jive excuse for a test book I have ever seen. It is filled with typos and question and answer sections that appear to be totally non sequitur. Just one example of the poor editing that went into this book is a question that offers: answer (D)None of the above and (E)All of the above. The correct answer is (E)which refutes itself by including (A) and (B) (both valid responses) with (D) none of the above. The book is filled with logical blunders such as this as well as a copious amount of spelling errors. Don't BUY!!
3,WHAT?,"""WHAT? "" has been my response througout this book. I understand LSAT reasoning and when I take other LSAT review test I generally understand why the right answer is correct. In this book I have found more misleading questions than in any other review guide. The most absurd thing I have found is an answer that says, ""'B' is correct, 'D' is correct, the answer is 'B.'"" - without justifying why the ""B"" answer is any better than the ""D"" choice. The book is not good as a diagnostic, but is decent for simple practice and exposure to LSAT questions."
1,I'm usually not so terse...,"...but this movie was pretty stupid. I believe it was trying to be funny, but it was really hard to tell. I actually sat through the whole thing though. That's time I'll never get back..."
3,Pretty Good,"I thought this movie was a good attempt. I really don't get what people have aganist the Liam Neeson movie although the script was lacking the actors were superb. The actors in this movie were tens times less than the ones in the new movie. One thing I did like about this movie is that it is more correct to the book. Marius and Cosette are two thumbs down, and the actors who played Jean Valjean and Javert just weren't right for their parts. This movie is worth renting though."
4,Great TV.,"The good-guys were good, the bad-guys bad. The acting was great, the costumes too. Good to see this without commercial interruption."
3,Nice film--but no music!,Film version of Les Mis has great acting and authentic setting. However I didn't realise when reading other reviews that this was a dramatic version based only on the book (not the play) and therefore all the glorious music is not part of it. How dissapointing.I enjoyed watching it and would still recommend it as a film. It's a great story and it was acted out superbly.There are other DVD's of this play that seem to be only concert versions of the music without any staging. I'd like to see a version with both.
1,DVD is missing 30 minutes,"This 1978 British television production is one of the better English-language adapatations of Les Miserables. Unfortunately, the DVD release is missing 30 minutes of footage. Originally shown in two parts at a length of 150 minutes, the DVD edit has been chopped down to 120. (The VHS tape edition plays complete.)Had I known this disc was an incomplete version I would not have purchased it. If you want to see the complete film --- and it's well worth it --- you'll need to buy the VHS tape."
5,I have been lookimng for this since I saw it 25 years ago,Very weel done gives you a better background on the prison life than other versions of this story. Helps you have a better understanding of the significance.
2,Way too slow.,"I thought, Anthony Perkins. This should be good. I was wrong. It had some good elements, but in general, very slow and boring."
4,Old classic,This movie is as I remember it to have been. I thought it came out earlier than 1978 but I was wrong. My girlfriend enjoyed the movie more than I did. I'm not quite into the old classics as much as I thought.
2,'Literary Masterpieces' VHS is also missing 30 mins,"Previous reviewer notes 30inutes from original 2-part show missing from DVD but present in VHS. Actually the ""Literary Masterpieces"" VHS is ALSO abridged. Run time is 124 minutes according to sleeve, not 150 minutes as stated on Amazon. MAYBE the other VHS version is complete, but not the Literary Masterpieces version."
4,A whole new experience,"This is a wonderful television, picture is crystal clear and reception is good. I am using my existing off-the-air antenna and I cannot believe there are so many more digital tv channels in addition to the analog channels. I really don't need cable now. Cosidering the HDTV tuner set-top box is around $300 this days. This HDTV is a bargain in my opinion. I've notice some minor geometry misalignment on it but unless you run the test patants, most people will not notice it. If you perfer 16:9 HDTV, you can check on TX-P2670WH too. Another bargain priced HDTV is Sanyo's HT32744 which can be found on some Wal-Mart stores for $747."
1,Dead On Arrival,"We purchased this on the 10th of the month, received it on the 20th, plugged it in after the delivery person left (big mistake) and no picture! Amazon considers this to be a special product and after it is delivered - Amazon won't accept it as a return. They ask that you work the ""In home warranty process"" with the Manufacturer. In pursuing it with Samsung, they initially told us the unit was probably a ""Refurb"" (Amazon said this wasn't correct). However, it is now the 23rd, and we're still awaiting a appointment date with a Servicer. So far, this is on the bad end of the spectrum of what can happen when you buy a big ticket electronics item on line. If I was to do this again, I would have plugged it in before the delivery person left and refused shipment. Other buyers beware."
1,A wonderful two weeks,"Just like several reviews below, my tv died after two weeks and began to turn itself off and on. After working with Samsung for two months they finally offered to give me a replacement...which is worth less than this one. Thanks for tv!"
5,Absolute comfort!,These clogs are so comfortable. I work in a cooking school and this is the first time I can remember coming home without aching feet. Thank you Quark!
1,size is too small,"I love the old Quark Liberty, but this one is so disappointed me, size is too small, the shoe is too narrowed and too tight."
2,Eh?,"There are better books out there about being an assistant to a boss. This book does not go into depth. It's too basic, and not meaty enough."
2,Not My Style,"This book probably suits certain types of workers. Not me. It doesn't fit with my world view, let alone work style."
1,Good for nothing!,"I bought this book thinking it would provide pointers on how to handel specific, everyday, and even ""ordinary"" situations assistants encounter with their bosses, and others in the workplace. Pointers that when carried out correctly would prove that you indeed are a ""take charge assistant"".Instead, this book focuses on getting on your bosses good side, which is great, if all you want to be known for is being the dependable ""worker"". I was expecting somethig way more contrete, This book was too wishy-wasy for me.I give it one star because eventhiugh I don't think it specifically states it there is an underlying message of the importance of communication."
2,ROBBING COOK,"Based on the medical thriller by Robin Cook, this tv movie version has little of the suspense and careful plotting of its source.Joanna Kerns stars as a recently widowed Chief of Staff whose patients are dying suddenly even though at their last physicals they were in fine shape. Tobin Bell (the SAW movies villain) plays a brilliant research scientist who has been working with genetics and possibly an anti-aging process, but he joins the list of victims. Gregory Harrison is the handsome financial-minded hospital administrator who falls for Kerns and Robert Englund (Freddy Krueger himself) is a shady fellow physician. It all moves at a snail's pace and the who in the whodunit becomes obvious rather quickly. Stick with COMA, one of the better adaptations of Cook's."
4,Inhale some new breathing techniques.,"Being that 3/4 of this book is on the science of breathing, I, like some of the other reviewers was kind of dissapointed, since I was expecting more practicle breathing exercies. But one tends to realize after reading it, that you do need to understand what the breathing techniques are actually physically doing if you want to master them.I think a good book to read after this one is ""The Secret of the Golden Flower"" by Thomas Cleary.For both these books, the price is right and the reading fascinating."
3,camera battery,It works but on the initial charge the battery became very hot using the charger that came with the camera for the orginial batteries. Have not done a second charge
1,Did not fit my JVC GR-C7U,"I bought this as a replacement battery for my JVC GR-C7U and the battery did not fit my camcorder; in fact, the battery I received was several sizes smaller than the actual GR-C7U battery(although the label on the battery I received claims ""GR-C7U"").The actual model number for a JVC GR-C7U compatible battery is NB-P7U, so look up the model number for the battery instead of the camcorder model to get more accurate search results."
4,Long Lasting Camcorder Battery,"I gave this battery as a gift to a very nice person, she uses her Camcorder a lot. As far as I know it has performed very well, meeting all expections!!"
2,Not what I expected,"I was disappointed with the battery I received. The website said it would be a Panasonic battery, but in fact it was only a ""compatible"" one. Seems like false advertising to me."
2,Lots of stupid decisions,"Audiovox's mp3 player (and I *hope* they've solved this by now) does not remember its place when it turns itself off (maybe 60 seconds of idle time).So not only does it not know where in a track it is when it turns back on, it actually returns to the root directory, so it doesn't even remember what track, what disc, or what folder it was in. This is just so easy to avoid and no one would use it the way it is. I can't find any firmware updates to fix it either. As it is it is next to useless.The only thing that is nice is that it was a regular-sized USB connector in the batter compartment that folds out and makes it a USB drive -- aside from that it was a complete waste of money."
1,don't buy unless you have outdated software,"This software says it will run on any version of Mac OSX - it will not. Apparently, it will not run on a Mac with Intel Core Duo either and the tech support in the US is disabled. There is an international tech support number that costs a $5 charge to use and really wouldn't be worth it in the first place. The box also said there would be a website with tech support and there is no support offered on sed website. Poor support and after looking at the accessible parts of the CD rom - very pixelated videos."
4,Air Boss Mach 3,This is a well made watch at a great price. Fast ship. The first watch was received with a problem. Contacted the seller and it was quickly replaced. One unique feature with this watch is the second hand does not rotate when just keeping normal time. Took a little getting use to. I assume this will help extend battery life. The watch comes with a generic instruction manual for all Victorinox watches which is hard to understand. There is a manual availabe at the Victorinox web site just for the AirBoss line that is much better.
5,Characters are historically acurate and well casted.,I read this book ten years ago and have been trying to find it since. it is probably the most engrossing history lesson i have ever wanted to pay attention to. EVERYONE is there...what ?? This is one of the most amazing stories ever!
2,THITH WATH THO DITHRACTING....,"Yes overall a good story, but my god it dragged like a dead dog. I found the charater of Joe Miller most distracting - I literally had to read the parts out loud for the first two chapters to figure out what the heck he was saying. Mushmouth is cute with Sylvethter the cat, but a whole books worth! Give me a break! I kept hoping this character would die. In general terms the story was good, but it could have had a little faster pace. It in no way compares to the first book of the series - I could not put it down. This one took me 3 wks. to read due to lack of interest. I think I will avoid the rest of the series and use MY imagination instead to develop Riverworld and all of its dynamics."
1,Ugh,"I was extremely disappointed with this book It was not nearly as intriguing as the first book. It also painted Mark Twain as this whiny, boring man. I think it is a pretty big task to recreate the character of Sam Clemens and PJF did very poorly in my opinion. I skipped chunks of the book because it was so pointless and didn't even bother reading the ending."
2,Disappointing and distracting,"After presenting such a wonderfully consistant and believable view of River World in 'To your scattered bodies go', I was repeatedly stunned by the unbelievable circumstances he presented in this, his second installment. JPF managed to make Mark Twain rather boring, and robbed the River World of all it's interesting features by abandoning subsistance living and introducing airplanes and firearms. Like the river it takes its name from, the river world series unerringly goes downhill...Definitely read 'To your scattered bodies go', but avoid this (and the rest of the series) like the plague."
2,Slow Paced and Boring,"I had a real hard time with getting past the first half of this book. Maybe because I hadn't read book 1 in the series. Or maybe because the pace is ""painfully"" slow. I was always a big fan of Mark Twain's work. However, as a main character he is not very interesting. I had a hard time figuring out if the characters were in Purgertory or a forth dimension or Heaven or what.I will try to look for the first book in the series and see if it helps."
4,The Nazz sezz,"This is a frozen momnet in a brilliant artist's life. He was part come-on-artist and part artist. Did he and Neil Cassady ever meet? That would have been comic atomic warfare.-PhilRating only apply to things of this plannet, I'd rate Buckley a clear *.!!!"
4,"Nice ""forever"" grill","I love this grill.Pros: Solidly made. This should easily last a life time. Adjustable grill. Easy to clean ash pit. The grill is very thick and well made, I don't see this ever wearing out. The top swivels. The top can be locked to the bottom, if desired.Cons: Weighs a ton, not something you want if you want to move your grill around. The handles to lower and raise the grill can get kind of hot, you'll need hot pads.I have mine sitting on my deck. The stand can be bolted down, if desired. The top can be lifted off the stand if you want to put it away for the winter. This grill is a good choice if you want a park type grill but don't want to bother with digging a hole and mounting it in concrete."
1,"Awful logic, tendentious manipulation of facts",This hatchet job is truly a scandal. The author has an ax to grind. Skip it.
4,Fats in Texas,"I love this album on Fats, as I've been a fan since 1956. He could sing the national anthem and it would be great. The sound is excellant and this two-hour concert contains even more hits by him than those listed. The song listing is 34, but the actual number of tracks are 36. Right after ""I'm In Love Again"" you can add ""Honeychile"" which was a top ten, and after ""So Long"" you can add ""Natural Born Lover"" which made top thirty. What I do not like about this 2 CD collection is this: it was recorded in 1989 in Texas and first appeared in a 3 LP collection with the live audience. Now, Tomato has deleted the live audience from the original trying to make these tracks sound as if there studio recordings, which there not. That is my only complaint, and it takes away from what was a real live show."
3,I love those 70's B rated movies !!,"This movie was fun in a lot of ways,and also somewhat corny too,as you might expect.But take it for what it is....a 70's B movie! Anybody who buys this movie knows they're not going to see an academy award winner,but that's what makes it fun.It doesn't take itself seriously.It has everything you want, a little nudity,great 70's music,4 hot looking cheerleaders with nothing on their minds except....well,you know.Have fun with it and enjoy."
1,Super Leaky,"I bought this to apply weld-on 3, and I could not get a good enough seal tightening down the cap, so the adhesive just leaked out through the cap when I was trying to apply the weld-on through the needle. I had to get a real syringe to do the job, which worked perfectly."
2,Not for Novice,I have never used weld-on before and probably never will again. The needle took a quite a bit of pressure to finally get some of the weld-on 16 out. Next to nothing comes out and after a few uses the applicator no longer works. The needle eye is too small to clean...
3,more bang for your tourist buck!,"Instead of just blandly heading off into picture postcard America, consider traveling with a purpose -- to experience the intense energy boosts of sacred sites, modern & ancient.To that end Rebeccasreads recommends you take along Brad Olsen's SACRED PLACES NORTH AMERICA. While the writing is utilitarian, the maps busy & the b&w photos a bit shabby, the information offered will certainly get more bang out of your buck in the sites you visit -- such as Graceland, Crater Lake & 106 other more & less known places in the length & breath of this continent."
5,Best Green Tea Ever!,This has got to be the best green tea on the market today. Excellent flavor and a bargain thru Amazon.com.
2,Doesn't taste at all like green tea,"Did I get a bad batch? People here seemed to rate it so highly? Very bland taste for me. Strangely enough, whatever aroma is there almost more of chamomile or peppermint than actual tea. Yes I tried a few different times -- steeping longer, less water, different temperatures. Does a better job at replicating the color of tea than the flavor. Don't know what else to say."
5,A Favorite,"Love this book. It is NOT Chrichton's usual, that's for sure. It tells more truth about drug culture in the 60's than most scholarly tomes."
5,A Classic,"What a fun read. So much less pompous than the rest of Michael Crichton stuff with a real feel for the 1960's drug scene.I find myself quoting a line from the book repeatedly. There is a scene where the main character goes to his friends room and the girlfriend wearing only a robe, crosses her legs giving him a long slow shot. ""Nothing offered,"" the character says, ""just letting you know it's all there."""
3,Cover Description,"From the cover:""Take the 'High' road with Peter Harkness as he travels the Berkeley-to-Boston trade route for marijuana. Peter takes the money and comes back with tidy packages of little bricks of dope soakd in Coke (to diguise the smell). There's plenty of action and then plenty of hassle when Peter's lady gets busted for holding forty bricks (or eighty pounds) of marijuana. Suddenly, everything becomes very heavy for a formerly straight college student named Peter Harkness."""
5,One happy customer,"I give this seller 5 stars for super fast service, excellent pricing & great shipping."
3,Advanced book,"This book is a third year graduate level text. You must already know Lie Algebra, smooth manifolds etc. It is good if you have the right background; otherwise, it is hard painful reading."
4,Hard to say,"This was the official 100% recommended, guaranteed text for my Riemannian Geometry class. Supplementing this book with do Carmo's text, I was able to get something out of the class, but I think rereading both of them now would be much better. The condensed one chapter course on manifolds at the beginning of GHL wasn't sufficient to learn/relearn everything I needed to know in order to read it for the first time."
5,Great DVD,I love this DVD. It offers great variety. You can choose your own level and the practice.Great music.
3,not as good as it could be,This has a great deal of good information but I wish that the music was better...the sitar is too loud for meditation. It should also be more professionally put together.
2,Crazy in the Kitchen,I didn't like this book. When you read Crazy in the title it is the truth. Life is too crazy for me to spend time reading about it.
2,disappointing,"I found this interesting, but somewhat depressing. With the living conditions in Italy years ago and living in the States with a grandmother, mother, father and daughter was totally different than my family as I was growing up. The cooking in later life with the author and her husband were interesting."
2,Cathartic for the author?,"I got this book to read on a trip to Europe. However, I didn't bring the book home with me, because I didn't deem it worthy of the space in my bag. It reads as though its writing was a cathartic experience for the author, to clear the air between her and her family memories. Unfortunately, this does not make for enjoyable reading. The writing itself is technically solid, but the subject matter left a bad taste in my mouth, as though I'd eaten something disagreeable. I came away with an overwhelming sense of disgust and hate, the same senses that pervaded the author's home as she's described it here. This book did not leave me happy or satisfied."
5,Perfect.,"A former member of now-defunct bands Poor Old Lu and Rose Blossom Punch, this is Aaron's first solo album. With artful arrangements and honest, introspective lyrics, the songs on Moontraveler make you want to close your eyes and just melt into the music. Every word and note is so beautifully expressed. Aaron's melodic voice hovers over a textured blend of guitar combined with skillful and inspired songwriting. Tunes like the mellow, rhythmic ""A Friend I Had"" are comforting and simple, while the catchy riffs of ""Antennae's Wife"" will be swirling around in your head for days. This is an amazing album by an incredibly talented artist."
3,"""In these recent years I have noticed that your face has slightly changed""","Aaron Sprinkle (who has been involved with so many different bands as a producer and has been in a few different bands himself) has an uncanny knack to find the perfect guitar tones for his songs and, along with his soft voice, it makes his music incredibly appealing if not ultimately memorable. His CD is easy to listen to and just as easy to forget. He has better ones out there (check out his Rose Blossom Punch) and you're not going to clamour to put this one back on again after you've listened to it a few times but while you're listening to it you'll be realizing that it goes down smooth and doesn't cause any heartburn. 3.5 stars.Highlights are the light Hawaiian breeziness of ""Not All Bad"" and the plaintive but beautiful and clean ""a friend i had""."
2,Good concept,"A good concept for a story that doesn't develop well enough to be thsi short of a book. Basically they spend most of their time hidden and then escape in the nick of time. I wished that this book would've been better, it had the potential to be greater and unfortunately the ideas didn't always live up to the promise of what I think the writers wanted them to."
3,"good, but inaccurate","I really liked this book. It has everything from Changlings to Jem'Hadar to religious riots. However, Jem'Hadar don't sleep and Changelings don't have names. If you can ignore this you will have a lot of fun reading it, though."
2,This book had a heart attack...,"The book starts out fairly good, but then once they go off into the gamma quadrant and meet the Jem'Hadar warship, it sucks. The Jem'Hadar act nothing like they do in the show, and neither do the changelings. The changelings talk about the weather and other cultures, and they take Odo to an outpost where changelings are just walking around. And worse, the Jem'Hadar are hunting down something on their ship for sport, wearing something you'd see in Hawaii. Don't buy this book!!!!! I set it on fire after reading it."
1,Government sugar control?,"I tried the low sugar product and the sugar free too. These are terrible! I have been a Quik drinker for 50 years. It is my comfort drink on cold nights. I will not buy this new product, but I cannot find the original product either. I guess Hershey's syrup is my next choice. Don't waste you money on the new mix. Come get mine; I won't use it!"
5,Very Nice!,"I'm glad that this item includes a safety clamp to lock it onto the antenna, cause without that it would be easy for someone to steal it, and believe me you will turn heads!"
1,A Waste Of Time,"Yes, in my opinion this film is a waste of time. In the hands of a better script writer & director (e.g. = Ingmar Bergman or Alfred Hitchcock) something credible & interesting might have been forged, but I found my self alternately groaning & at one point point (the ending scene) laughing at the inane writing & directing. Both Bridges' & Sarandon's acting (as well as that of the others in the film) was competent - they did as well as they could with the little they had available to them. Except for the presence of Bridges, Sarandon & other talented actors, this film reminds me of Roger Corman's films. They must have had to participate in this because of their contracts - I can't see any other reason.Please don't waste your time or money on this nonsense."
4,Deep Sleep,"This relaxed me enough to fall asleep and stay asleep. Until the cd is over that is! Put it on loop and that should help. Also, if you can take some herbal sleep inducers and drink some camimile tea you'll be out like a light and feel compleatly refreshed the next day."
1,Not so relaxing,"I just don't really like her narrative or voice tone. It doesn't work for me...... at all. I guess the picture of the boats is nice, though."
3,too short,"this CD is WAY too short for real relaxation. Sandy's voice is wonderful, I absolutely love listening to her, but the cd is just too short. I'm a really tense, stressed out individual and I have to listen to this cd at LEAST three times to get any benefit out of it. At least her voice is soft beginning to end so it doesn't really disturb me when the cd starts over."
1,Samsung HT-DS690 Foresale!!!!!!!!!! If your insane to purchase it.,"I purchased this unit on 10/23/04 and it had been in the shop 3 times for the same reason, freezing up while watching DVD's, read errors when trying to access DVD's. Samsung of course informed me that they would extend my warranty for the 3 months being the unit was in the shop more then it was in my living room. Now it as taken a dump again and they will not do anything about it of course. They should rename the company Crapsung."
2,Travel Bill-Disposable Diurinal,"I bought the TravelJohn-Disposable Urinals thinking they were a portable toilet, especially for #2 since Urinal is Latin for Urinus, the Roman god of fertilizer. Well, they're strictly for #1, this I found out while I was in the museum with no toilets.First of all, who needs a Disposable Urinal for #1? We have nature or back alleys for that so it's not hard to find a place for #1.Secondly, my Urinal pack didn't come with instructions so I had no idea how to use it. It's some snorkleing bag."
2,My Bladder Is Bigger...,"Great product for smaller capacity bladders. But I can quickly fill this to the rim and then some.... (too much info?) Well, you should know. So unless your body has a quick shut off ability - you're heading for trouble if you're a big water drinker during the day."
4,Excellent Product,I will not travel without them. They also come in handy when the grand kids are traveling with us. The product is easy to use and easy to dispose of.
5,Handy!!!!,Comes handy specially in long trips and emergencies don't need to worry for smell or overspill GREAT and can be carried until you find a please to drop it
4,an all-time underated band !,"Given the lack of quality footage of Free available, this is a must have for any fan of this band. Along with the Faces, Free does NOT get the kudos & recognition they deserve ... and this DVD set shows us what a superb band they were. There should be no doubt that if Paul Kossoff had lived, Free would have re-united at some point, and showcased their immense talents to a whole new generation of music fans ... a 'dream double-bill' , Free & Bad Co.... with Paul Rodgers handling lead vocals & Simon Kirke the drums for both groups !!"
3,Second set,"The second five are not as good as the first five. If Sharpe's reputation is so well known, haven't the women heard that close association with him could easily be a death sentence? Or do they care..."
4,From Rifles to Swords,"Richard Sharpe finds himself in the unusual position of a swordfight to the death in this episode of the Sharpe series. Sean Bean plays the character with his usual aplomb, and peripheral characters such as Hogan return. Like all the Sharpe movies, this one is watchable and entertaining, and the plot of Napoleon attempting to capture Wellington's spy, El Mirador, adds to the suspense."
5,Space Book,"I learned about stars, comets, space stations, and houses on Mars. I think people 7 and up should read this book."
3,It's a lessons learned book and engineer's helper.,"Fossil fuel power plants are front and center in this book, and this book will familiarize you with older equipment in those plants that is still in service."
1,Don't waste your money!!!!!,I bought the Austin Bazaar red colored mini guitar for my son and according to his music instructor it is absolutely useless. It can not be tuned because of the placement of the bridge. It looks cute but is now just another toy. I now have to spend money to but my son a guitar he can use for his guitar lessons. Don't waste your money.
2,It broke,"It looks nice and everything. great material, but the little strings on it broke off, can't hang it on anything :("
5,very nice,"Unlike many recordings of medieval music that sound weak, tinny, or too slick and studio polished, this one has a nice full, hearty sound. Very pleasant listening--stimulating yet relaxing. I'm not an expert on medieval music by any means but I thought this disc was a cut above others I've heard."
4,it works,"This works as expected on my truck but be warned that the little rubber tips they use for the support bars end get brittle and break easily.Fortunatley, when I contacted the manufacturer, customer service was helpful and shipped me some spare tips."
4,Good Value,"I have two of these sets in different colors. Even though it says dry clean , I have washed mine and they come out beautiful. Great bedding."
1,Horrible....,"First of all, its marked wrongly and if it says 'King' it means it is 'Queen'. Secondly, after using it for couple of times, the down used in this started coming out through the seams and we had to stop using, fearing it might cause some health problems to my kids. Definetely not worth the price...."
3,Only for diehards,"Hi folks, this dvd is only for diehard fan's like myself who wish to see anything with Elvis in it. It has some cool unseen footage in it, like Elvis being sworn into the army, getting onto the ship heading to Germany, home movies shot by Eddie Fadal during some of Elvis' visits. There is no Elvis music in the dvd, its a cheap impersonator which is a letdown. The audio disk is just another rehash of the early Elvis, Scotty, Bill live. All in all, i'd skip this and wait for ""this is elvis"" to be released on dvd. Pretty cheesy stuff here. This is only for diehard fans."
3,"In some ways, deceptive, but worth buying","This DVD is most likely for the ""die hard"" fans, it has some great footage of Elvis and the stories told by Elvis' buddies are great to hear, but the DVD is not in full color as stated on the cover, in fact, the only parts that are in color are the interview segments with Elvis' friends, the footage of Elvis is in black and white.The booklet that is included with this DVD, (although worth seeing) has only black and white photos as well, not full color as stated and the 55 minute audio documentary included, is in my opinion, unnecessary, because most of it uses interview segments already seen in the DVD and The CD that is included, has been previously released.The thing that makes this DVD special, is the army footage of Elvis that is included, that alone makes the DVD worth buying."
2,Elvise the Missing Years,"The DVD Came in a SORRY Padded Envelope & inside the case one of the places where the DVD is supposed to be secure IS BROKEN,, Luckly the DVD isnt damaged..So this is why I'm giving it two stars.. If the person would have just shook the case alittle bit they would have heard that it was broken inside from all the ratteling...Product Description said nothing about being damaged.. All it sais was this....Product DescriptionThis special collector's edition DVD box set features a full color DVD with rare footage showing the private man behind the icon plus a 55 minute audio documentary. The set also includes an Audio CD with his early music,including 1954 recordings by Elvis"
2,"For only a penny, get what you pay for...","Purchased four of these (when a previous order from another company I ordered from -- 3 batteries; none would hold a charge! -- didn't impress me) paid $18/bat. so, so far two of THESE batteries will not hold a charge. One does, another I've yet to try in my phone. At least I didn't pay $18 a piece for them as I did the other order. Waiting to see if I get my money back on that order, again from another company not affiliated with Amazon. Just be cognizant of what you are purchasing and for how much..."
4,great book for my 11 month old!,"My daughter loves this book, the hard board edition is great but a bit on the small side, the mini pages (different times the lady bug goes to see other animals to fight) are kind of small as is the text, making it difficult to point to the words I am reading as she looks on. I like this book but it is slightly expensive. nonetheless its a good book to have!"
5,Grouchy Ladybug - great book,Very cute book- I recommend all of Eric Carle's books. We especially like The Very Hungry Caterpillar.
1,"Nice Artwork, Bad delivery of good message","The only reason I am rating this book a 2 is because the artwork is nice. Eric Carle is our favorite pre-school story-teller but he missed the mark on this one. The child is left laughing at the fact that the main character wants to fight everyone... what kind of message is this? When it comes to my 2 year old, he is VERY impressionable and I do not want him to think altercations like this are funny. I usually re-word awkward stories like this but I cant even think of a substitute for the word ""fight"" that would make any sense. I am sorry I bought this one."
3,The Grouchy Lady Bug,"This book is a fun book for small children to read. In it a grouchy lady bug attempts to start fights with other animals, until she meets her match, a whale. She learns her lesson in the end and isn't quit as grouchy. This book is one I would recommend for children to read, it teaches them first of all pick on somebody your own size and don't fight at all because it's much better to be nice."
2,I can relate to the ladybug.,"I enjoyed reading the Hungary Catapiller to my nephews and niece, so I was excited when I saw the Grouchy Ladybug. I think it's a great book for older children, b/c it shows children how if you're mean and start fights, no one will want to play with you. The other reason I really enjoyed this book is because it helps to teach kids about telling time. The whole book is cute. The art work is amazing and the kids like the bright colors. All in all, I think it's a great book for kids and parents to either read aloud or just look at the pictures."
4,Great Little Book,"I got this book for some friends who have a year and a half year-old daughter. thumbing through it, even I enjoyed it. The hardcover version has great colors, pages are different sizes and kids get to learn how to tell time and kids begin to learn an important lesson."
5,Another Eric Carle Classic,"This is certainly one of Eric Carle's classica with a it of an offbeat story, but great nonetheless. If you're really into children's books about ladybugs, I recommend Ladybug Baby Bug, by Janice and Mark Perkins, for it's warm, family message and colorful illustrations of the adorable ladybug family.Ladybug Baby Bug"
3,"My daughter loves it, but...","My daughter loves this book, and the one thing I like about it is that she knows all the animals. But this book is very tiring and annoying to read out loud, the same phrases repeated over and over. I also don't think the story is appropriate for toddlers, talking about aphids and fighting. We hide this book often but my daughter always seems to find it. I just can't emphasize how annoying it is, and I love books and love reading to my daughter. I would not recommend this book to anyone. There are other books out there that teach animals."
1,Disappointing Title from Eric Carle,"""Hey you,"" said the grouchy ladybug, ""Want to fight?""Not only does the bad-tempered protagonist ask once -- he tries to pick a fight with every single character in the book! Only to get smacked around by a whale at the end.Perhaps it ""invites children to explore the concepts of time, size, shape, and manners"" as advertized on the back cover...I think the more poignant lesson is that the biggest guy wins. It's disappointing to see author Eric Carle's award-winning investment in a book with such an unpleasant tone.The book appears to be written for a 3-6 year old audience (in my opinion), but it's one children's story that we won't be keeping on our shelf."
2,A Grouchy Lady Bug,"I picked two stars for many reasons. This book is not good for little children, because in the story the character is, a fighter, and does not share. Children's book should be opposite of that, they should be teaching children to share and to respect and not to fight with others. I think that this book is for children 5 or 6 and up because they should know that they should not be fighters, mean, and to share.This book is mostly for boys, because boys are more interested in fighting and not being nice and not sharing. And this story is I like to say aggressive. It's not really for girls. Girls are more in to like nice sharing and not fighting stories.That is what I have to say about The Grouchy Lady Bug."
1,I really dislike this book,"As another reviewer said, we are not incredibly conservative or anything. But I'd like to keep my three-year-old's innocence going as long as possible. I threw this book away after reading it just once, since the main character just picks fights with everyone. Why would I even want to introduce the notion of fighting to my son?? This is not a good children's book."
1,Totally inappropriate for anyone,"This book should be black listed. Almost every page has this sentence ""Hey, you wanna fight"" on it. Never read it to a child. It condones fighting. Kids learn enough bad things on their own without this idea being drummed into their heads."
2,The Grouchy Ladybug,"This book is about a grouchy ladybug that doesn't want to share a leaf with another friendly ladybug, so he flies off trying to find some other animal to fight with for no reason. I picked two stars because I think this book teaches kids how to fight when they don't get something all to themselves with out sharing. I think that children's books should teach about sharing your things with others even if they like it a lot. I think that this book shouldn't be for younger children under age five. So six years old and up should read this because they will understand that you shouldn't fight and they should realize that this is just a story and that they shouldn't start fights.This book seems like boys would enjoy it more because they are more interested in fighting and the grouchy ladybug tries to be big and bad by fighting. I don't think girls would like it as much because they are more into sharing and being nice."
1,The very Grounchy Ladybug,I rate this bookony a one. It does not teach children anyhting good at all. If it teaches them anything it would be how to be mean and how to fight. That is all the little old lady bug does in this story. It is not good for children at all.I think this book is not good at all.
1,Worst book for children ever written,I actually felt dirty after reading this to my 4 year old. After about the 5 page I wanted to fight the author!
2,The kids seem to like it,"I can't say the book is bad, because the kids seem to enjoy it - mostly for the animal pictures. I eventually had to hide it because I got sick of reading it. It just doesn't read well out loud - same phrase over and over and over and over just gets stuck on your tongue."
3,Very artistic but kind of a wierd message,"I was expecting this to be a book about a ladybug who resolved it's anger toward the end, but it wasn't what I thought it would be.I loved the artwork, but for a toddler it's not really user friendly.I recommend waiting till your child is about 6 before buying this book!"
2,Wanna fight?,"Eric Carle is my favorite children's author and illustrator - his books are like works of art to me. Unfortunatley the ""Wanna fight"" parts of this book just aren't great for younger children."
3,Interesting Carle Story,"I just bought this and had to read it myself based on all the conflicting opinions on the story. It's an interesting story. I wouldn't have thought about ladybugs being grouchy... it teaches a very valuable lesson in the end, but I don't think it's Carle's best work. The ""fighting"" plot didn't bother me that much, but I think it would have been better to pick a different ""negative, grouchy"" theme. It's not a Carle book I would recommend going out of your way to buy... go with his earlier works, but also include the Quiet Cricket as well..."
3,Not the best Carle book for toddlers,"Many of Carle's books are perfect for toddlers, even though they are recommended for the 4 and older crowd. I'm not sure this is one of them. My son (age 2) enjoyed the simple narrative and the repetition, but I was uncomfortable with the premise of a grouchy bug who keeps picking fights with larger and larger animals--and for no apparent reason either, other than the fact he's feeling grouchy. Also, the pictures of the clock and use of time progression (At six o'clock he did such and such...At seven o'clock he....)were totally lost on my son. This book is better suited for the early-reader crowd, although I think THE VERY HUNGRY CATERPILLAR, THE VERY BUSY SPIDER, and BROWN BEAR, BROWN BEAR, WHAT DO YOU SEE? are far superior (although none of them have the gimmick for teaching time)."
5,One of Eric Carle's very best!,"This book is a delightful book for small children, and just as much fun for the adult reading it, with a wonderful lesson besides. Eric Carle's personal story and how he creates his wonderful collage illustrations is wonderful, too. This book is available as a board book in a smaller size for little hands, but the larger size I got in this order is fine for me."
1,Inappropriate for Children,"I read the first two pages of this book to my children and then made up a story to go along with the illustrations for the remainder of the book. As other reviewers have said, ""Hey You! Want to fight?"" is repeated on every page and not the type of thing I want to teach my young boys. I would have expected more from Eric Carle, and have put this in the garage sale box."
4,The Bad Tempered Ladybird,"While this is not one of my favourite Eric Carle books to read aloud, my 4yo son loves it and will sit there pretending to read it to himself. He has long been a fan of the Very Hungry Caterpillar so was thrilled to discover this book."
2,Don't like,"My two year old really doesn't like this book. I got it since all the other books we have by the same author are really cute. This one is just a grumpy book. I'm sure there is a lesson, yes, but I will find another way to teach my son that bullying isn't right."
2,"Beautiful pictures, bad storyline","I got this book for my infants at the childcare center I work at. I started reading it to a child and had to stop after a few pages. I flipped ahead hoping that there would be some moral at the end. Basically after trying to pick a fight with a bunch of animals, the ladybug accidentally gets slapped by a whale and gives up and says one nice phrase on the last page. Otherwise the language used in the book is not appropriate for very young children (very rude and sassy) And you cannot really explain the ""moral"" if that is what you want to call it. If you really want to get this book I would suggest that the age be 7+. I wouldn't read it to my 6 year old, I know that the only thing he would get out of it would be the imfamous phrase that repeats throughout the book... ""Do you want to fight."""
1,Not for small children,"My children have enjoyed most of Eric Carle's books. However, the only thing my 5-year-old took away from this book was the words, ""Hey, you! Wanna fight?"" This phrase is repeated throughout the story. Older children may be able to understand the lesson learned at the end, but I really can not recommend this book."
2,Grouchy Ladybug makes a grouchy father!,"My father purchased this book for my two-year-old daughter. She absolutely adores the book---to my wife's and my dismay. She requests to have this book read over and over to her. As one previous reviewer noted, ""Repetition is the best tool in teaching."" Yes, I agree, but what do you want your child to learn? I really do not want my daughter to approach people saying ""You wanna fight?"" when she feels grouchy. I realize that there is a nice ending and the ladybug learns it lesson. The moral is not repeated and emphasized, though. If children learn through repetition, ""You wanna fight?"" is what is going to stay in their head. The concept of a grouchy ladybug is wonderful, and the correlation with teaching time is nice, too. With a different story, this book could be great. I am not sure how this book has remained popular for the last twenty-five years. It lost its popularity in our house after the first reading."
1,won't read this to my son,"Thank goodness this book is beautifully illustrated b/c I won't be reading the text to my son. The whole premise of the book is that this ladybug goes around asking people to ""fight"" and rather than turning the ladybug down (b/c fighting is wrong) they agree to and then the ladybug chickens out.My husband and I are hardly what you would call conservative, but I just don't see why I want to invite the notion of fighting in to my sons life. Eric Carle has so many other wonderful books. I suggest just skipping this one."
4,Rhyming fun,"While searching for new tires for his car, Pa Grape encounters a variety of shapes including a triangle, rectangle, square, oval, circle & crescent.Fun rhyming text. Larger books have better illustrations because the paper is slick like a magazine & colors are bright against the white background. This mini book's pages are like construction paper & dimmer. It would be great to travel with in the car & for little hands to read (as long as they don't tear the pages) because it is smaller than the original hardcover."
1,Terrible,"This has got to be THE WORST movie I have ever seen, besides the Hell 2 The Naw one by the same company. This was a ""remix"" version of the stupid Blair Witch Project. The women were screaming so much in this movie it had me BEGGING if my boyfriend could turn the stupid movie off. The acting was horrible. The DVD box had typos on it. The graphics were not digital so the quality of the picture was AWFUL. It deserves to be on HOTGHETTOMESS.com. This was below B-Rated. It was a waste of $4.99."
5,mermaid,"I thought that this film was very heartwarming. A young girl loses her father when she is four years old. Her mother obviously distraught was left to care for her alone, with the help of her mother and some friends. The little girl loved mermaids. Because the little girl didnt understand where her father had gone, her grandmother told her that she could write a letter to him, which they attached to a balloon. the balloon floated away and landed by a lake known as Mermaid lake in Mermaid City. A hunter found the letter and took it home, showed it to his family and decided to write back. The little girl recieved the letter later on and went to visit this family. They became firm friends. Meanwhile the mother became quite close to an old friend, whihc may have turned into a romance.Overall i loved this film it was very sad but had a nice ending and was based on a true story."
5,Beautiful!!!!!!!,"A child's letter to heaven gets an unexpected response in this touching family drama, inspired by actual incidents. Desi is a five-year-old girl who has become inconsolable after the death of her father. Desi's mother, Rhonda, isn't sure what to do for her troubled daughter and when the girl tells her mother she wants to write her father a last letter and attach it to a balloon so it will be carried to heaven, Rhonda agrees it's a good idea. Desi and Rhonda send out the balloon, which is carried by the winds to a small community known as Mermaid. There, a man named Wade MacKinnon finds the balloon, with the letter attached. After reading the message, Wade and his family decide to answer the letter, as if their missive had been written by Desi's late father.This is such a beautiful and moving story and indeed it will bring you to tears!"
2,Not so great,"Clip fabric rips extremely easily and once it does, the metal clip scratches your belt. If you're wearing nice clothing, it's not the best phone holster."
3,Some quality country music; bad presentation,"It was some time ago now, but as I am a Faron Young fan, I took well-preserved vinyls of my favorites which turned up on this product later, along with some of Faron's earlier works, and recorded them onto a cassette (my own version of his greatest hits). Having no sophisticated recording equipment at the time, I recorded them with an open microphone. Today, they still sound better on my tape player than they do on the compilation here (I never burned a CD). Even so, I question the quality of Mercury's original recordings. ""Yellow Bandana"", ""She Went a Little Bit Farther"" and ""It's Four in the Morning"" evoke special memories for me. They deserve a better presentation, a ""do over"" maybe."
4,Some Good and Some Bad,"This package includes all of Faron Young's Top 10 Mercury Hits and most of his bigger hits for the label.Now some bad news up front. Like the previous reviewer, I must complain about the sound. It does sound like some of these cuts were taken off 3rd and 4th generation masters. For such an important compiliation, that is unexusable. More bad news, no recording data. At least a listing of the dates by the songs would have been appreciated.But on the other hand, I guess this is better than nothing!!! The songs are all original recordings. The booklet is very imformative, and like I said, the only thing missing is the recording data."
3,Easy to understand.,"Although my husband thought the tricks were too corny to use, the directions for teaching each trick was easy to understand and pretty detailed. Since we didn't pay over $10.00 for it, it wasn't worth sending back."
2,Ok-But did not live up to expectations,I bought the basic and advanced Trickonometry to teach my horse tricks. It shows pictures of the finished product and gives narrative on how to do it; but the narrative is not all that clear. More pictures of each step along with the narrative would have been ideal. Would I buy them again - No.
2,tricks you would never train a stallion to do,"I bought this book to use with my then-two-year-old Azteca stud colt, who is very intelligent and curious (translated as difficult to keep his mind occupied). The tricks are not very inspiring and many have to do with using the horse's mouth in close proximity to the handler. It would be insane to teach a stallion a trick that could easily lead to him biting your face or neck. The closest thing to a liberty trick offered here is rearing, a behavior he used to use to challenge me, so not something I wanted him to do on cue. I was hoping for more liberty type training, not so much the ""smiles"" and ""yes/no"" nodding. I have since gelded him and am still looking for the right book on liberty training."
3,Needs color photos and better tricks.,Overall this is an adequate little trick book. Needs color photos and better tricks however. I'm sorry I paid full price for this one.
2,No to her pain methods of training,"I have been training animals for many years and was very disappointed that there was encouragement to use poking the horse with a nail. Any behaviorist will tell you that hurting an animal causes trust problems and should cause you to be concerned about trusting the animal not to turn on you! I challenge the author to update her training methods and recall this book. There are a few things that are positive training, and was able to use those. I train dogs and other animals and know that they would not want to be with me if I hurt them. It is the same with all animals that positive training is the best. I use my animals for therapy of special needs children, school children and hospital visits. I couldn't possibly take chances with an animal that didn't trust me not to hurt it! Thankfully there are other books available and I was able to pick and choose from them as well."
4,Harder than it looks,"I bought this game thinking it was going to be easy for me to do, it sounds easy enough after all. It's kind of a mixture of pong and bubbles. You have to use your ball to hit the squares to burst them all in order to clear the level. There are pieces in the game for you to change the color of your ball, as you can only pop the squares that are the same color as your ball. Maybe I'm not that coordinated or something, but I just got frustrated with this game. It was taking a lot more effort than this casual gamer was willing to put into it. Nice graphics, okay music, cute story line, but too hard for me!"
1,Save your money!,"We bought this game for our two boys to play; ages 5 and 11. They didn't like it from the moment they started playing it. So my husband and I decided to give it a try. It took both of us numerous tries to get through the various stages and then defeat the ""bosses"" in the extra stages. So many times that the game became frustrating; and not in a good Smash Bros kinda of way. What's so frustrating? After the initial 3 men, you only get 1 man at a time unless you earn a certain amount of points. So for most of the game you could be one and done! The concept and characters are fun to play and are visually stimulating, but logistically it's a nightmare. Save your money and go for something a little more player friendly!"
2,Not Enough of the Keys,"I bought this book hoping for great insight on Key West (an infinitely more desirable and intriguing locale to write about than Miami) and was sorely disappointed.I really enjoyed Sehlinger's Unofficial Guide to WDW and frankly, expected more from this book. A lot more.To be fair, most guide books don't pay nearly enough attention to the Keys, instead imparting more information than I ever wanted to know about Miami, a city that I've come to deplore.It might be me; I just don't get the hype and focus on a sullied, soulless, filthville of a town like Miami over the glorious, exquisite keys.At any rate, if for whatever unfathomable reason you really want to spend lots of time in Miami, this book is for you. If you're looking for Keys information, look elsewhere (though I haven't found a good alternative myself).Just be forewarned that there's a good reason MIAMI has a huge typeface on the front and ""the Keys"" is shrunk down in size. It's a damned shame."
3,"gosh, this is .... allright","well it looked fun, and it was, untill i started actually using it. you really cant do much with it. the policemen doesnt work very well, but he does look cool at least. wolverine is definately the best."
5,Wow what a Buy!,"You are not going to find anything this good anywhere. He is huge, no GIAGANTIC! He is probably the most acuarate figure. I am saying he is amazingling detailed. You can feel the anger in his screaming face and the muscules all over his body. His swiping action is really cool. Just squeeze and let go. Okay COLLECTORS he is a great figure to own un-opened and when taken out of the package for display he stands great in great poses towering over everyone. Okay finally the accersory. This is the REASON that I rated it a 4 in durability because he has a bunch of strings and when he is suposidly is knocked out he just looks pitiful. He also has a donut in his hand that taks the seriousness out of the figure(s). Let me tell that this figure RULES! Buy it, it's one great buy."
3,middle-of-the-road blacksploitation,"Genre idols Fred Williamson and Pam Grier cannot elevate this lukewarm (and late) blacksploitation entry.Pamster is like the girl in that old nursery rhyme. When she was good she was very good (Foxy Brown), but when she was bad she was horrid (Sheba, Baby). Here she is weak, baby. Relegated to the damsel in distress role is not fair to her or to us. Williamson is better. Perhaps notBlack Caesargood, but he could'a been a contender, even in mainstream cinema. He had presence and bravado enough for an entire football team. In the end, there's not enough room for the two leads.Uneven supporting cast, typical of this period. Much of it fromFriday Foster, in fact. Thesoundtrackis not overly good, although the film boasts this gem of a line: ""They don't give a damn who gets killed just so long as the dice keep rollin', the ho's keep ho'in', and the money keeps flowin'!""Genre rating: 2.5 stars"
1,awful,"This book was way too wierd for me. If you like the very worst Dean Koontz books or the sort of thing that Stephen King wrote when he was in middle school, this book might appeal to you. The text is reminiscent of The Dukes of Hazard, a narrator providing too many details about what is going on. No subtlety. Bizarre plot. Augh!"
2,"Honestly, who'd want Jenny?","This book is the story of two psycho psychiatrists and what they're doing to poor Jenny. Jenny, is an overly-coddled rich girl, who has no personality to speak of (unless you're dealing with Linda, her split personality), not much of a spine, and yet she still manages to have every man in the story tripping over themselves to swoon over her.Coffey is an ex-cop cum cab driver. He too falls head over heels for cardboard Jenny. He's convinced she didn't kill the two men she's accused of murdering. Why? Because he loooooooves her after setting eyes on her once. Who cares that she's a spineless headcase, she's hot!The pacing in this book was terrible. It lurches and jumps all over the place. Overly predictable, there are several moments in the story that are really funny, it's just that the author probably didn't intend for them to be. Though, I do have to admit, the red car with SATAN spraypainted on the door was classic. Daughter of Darkness gets a second star just for that."
4,Too old but bought it anyway,"I'm a college student and have begun rebuying all my old disney favorites. I can understand why parents of younger children(7 and under) would not want them to watch Dumbo, although the movie is a classic and it is an amazing experience to go back and look at the old animation and compare it to today's standards. I actually wrote an english paper on this movie this year- comparing my views on it from when I was little to my current age. NOTE TO CONCERNED PARENTS- I owned Dumbo when I was little (I'm 19..so...) and I only remembered the vaguest parts of it- I knew his mom tried to protect him and got taken away, he learned to fly with a feather, he made friends with a mouse, and I remembered the creep pink elephants he sees. Other than that- nothing. As long as you watch it with them and say, ""Thats not very nice of them is it? What would you say?"" They're really not going to remember the details of it in the long run anyway. :)"
5,"20,000,000 Frenchmen Can't Be Wrong","There is nothing I can add to all of the heartfelt and insightful reviews I've seen on this site. But I've yet to see a sample of its international reknown. Check it out!At the 1947 Cannes Film Festival DUMBO won the Palm D'Or. Not too shabby. Even though the animated classic was 5 years old at that time it was still honored. I believe that the French judges wanted to catch up on all of the films they would have recognized had not a little thing called WWII begun on the eve of the first scheduled Cannes Film Festival, causing it to be sort of postponed (yet another decent thing those wretched goose-steppers messed up!). Disney has not received that honor a second time, putting DUMBO truly in a class by itself."
5,Dumbo (Big Top Edition) Used,Completely satisfied with purchase from vendor. DVD arrived in excellent condition. You would have never known it had been used. The disk and the other printed materials and game pieces were perfect condition. Arrival time and delivery was fast. My grandson is so happy to see the Dumbo story and will enjoy for many years to come.
5,Great move to add to a collection,If you into Disney movies this is a good addition to the collection.
1,"Defective ""Dumbo"" DVD",The DVD that I received was defective. It would not play. I had to pay to send it back and I am STILL waiting for the seller to take it off my credit card. I am very dissatisfied.
2,"Slow and boring for a 'classic""","this is my least favorite of all the disney movie well maybe tied with ""the fox and the hound"" and ""the black cauldren"" this has no substance and i really dont know what all the fuss is about."
1,A movie I wouldn't watch again for a long time,"Although the theme of the movie follows closely with other Disney flims (an outcast who ""wins"" in the end), the cruelty suffered by Dumbo is not. It was a very dark, depressing movie. I don't plan on watching Dumbo again for a very long time, if ever."
1,Have not received this yet!,"I ordered 3 disney movies at the same time, from three different people. I got two of those movies within 2 wks of my order. I have yet to receive Dumbo! It should have been here no later than November 26th! I am definitely NOT happy with this seller."
1,Unbelievable that so many are OK with the racism,"Wow- open your eyes, folks. I don't care if it was made 200 years ago, this is not the kind of cultural message I want to give to my little boy. Not to mention, the taunting, scary pink elephants, fire, drunkeness....Disgusting! Oh, and if your mom helps you through it, they lock her up. Nice messages for the little people (NOT!)"
5,Dumbo,Great movie and one of the best Disney movies ever. I gave it to someone because they had never seen it.
2,"Some light moments, to many dark moments.",We ranked this 32 out of the 41 Disney animated movies that we own. The best moment was the crows. The writers just piled to much misery onto poor dumbo.
3,Beware of Bonus material.....otherwise great,"The anniversary edition is awesome, with remastered artwork, many scenes are much more visible than previous versions, but BEWARE...If you are buying this for kids, PREVIEW the extra animated shorts before letting your kids see them. Our 3 yr old, who loves spooky stuff, is terrified by ""The flying mouse"" short, because there are bats that taunt the mouse (who is magically given bat wings) and sing a song titled ""You're nothing but a nothing"" looking very scarey. At one point he sees a reflection of himself as a scarey bat, and now our daughter won't take a bath because she's ""afraid of the bats""...Thanks Disney."
2,Not for sensitive two- or three-year-olds,"While this movie is entertaining for older children and adults, it is not for my sensitive two-year-old. For a young child, the older elephants are too cruel, scenes too dark, music scary, drunkeness inappropriate, pink elephant sequence too long... Thankfully, we rented from the library before I bought it. My two-year-old loves to watch the storks, Casey the Train and watch Dumbo fly but he asks me to fast-forward through the other parts that make him cry.I'm not trying to discount the other reviewers' feelings and wonderful memories of Dumbo, but just trying to warn those with very young children."
3,Underwhelming Disney non-classic,"The Bottom Line:A very short (~60 minutes) animated film by Disney that lacks the scope and ambition of the studio's more accomplished efforts, Dumbo isn't bad per se but it's a rather unimpressive story that will appeal more to children than their more-discerning parents.2.5/4"
1,won't play,This DVD will not play on my blu ray player. According to the description it should work. on all DVD players including bluray :(
1,doesn't always work,"When I tried to play this DVD on my bluray machine it says ""DuD""When I tried to play on another combo DVD/VHS machine it says ""Incorrect Disc""When I play it on anohter combo DVD/VHS machine it plays.This should play on all machines. It says it is ""enhanced"" so you would think it would play on my newest machine and not on the oldest."
3,Where is Dumbo II?,"I have looked through the special features on the 60th Anniversary Edition DVD and this new Big Top Edition DVD. The only difference that I can see is that this new Big Top Edition DVD has a ""My First Circus"" game and that the 60th Anniversary Edition DVD has the Dumbo II Sneak Peek.If the Dumbo II Sneak Peek is not on the new DVD that came out, does this mean that there will be no Dumbo II?"
2,Technical Trouble!!!!,"Lots of great features, but it doesn't play correctly on two of my three DVD players. It locks up on the JVC-XV-D723, and won't play on the Mac G3. The Imac G4 plays it fine. Nevertheless, it should work in all DVD players. I've contacted DisneyDVD about the problem, and we'll see how it goes."
4,Daughter loves it,"As a classic, I got this for my daughter. She loved the songs and the animation. Still a classic in my book!"
5,fun elephant,"who does not love a circus theme.. and as always, dumbos big ears. kids will come to adore this lovable movie."
4,Excellent,"This is an excellent DVD to give a child for the holidays. My niece loves this DVD, and that is the ultimate review from a three year old. Three year olds in my experience are very honest, so whatever else is said about this DVD know this, it passess the test of a youngster. So, if you have youngsters, and you need them to be distracted, this is a great tool.Joseph Dworak"
3,"Good content, bad sound","The content of the movie is excellent (as other reviews already point out), but the sound is horrible (am I the only reviewer to have experienced this problem?). I had to keep turning the volume up and down to be able to listen to some dialogues, and then not to have to shout over some other parts of the movie.Hard to believe that in these days and with so many technological advances, Disney cannot do any better at improving the sound of this DVD, especially given the price they are charging!"
3,BAD HANDLING!!!,This was a gift for my Grandson. I was embarassed to learn it arrived all mangled and the case broken. The discs were ok but since it's a special edition they like the cover and case to be intact. Hopefully they can figure out how to exchange without too much hassel.
3,A memorable movie,I saw this video many years ago as a college going student actually. Even at that age I loved the movie and I still find myself humming the song 'See an elephant fly'. A superb movie of which I don't remember much except that it moved me so much.
2,Never one of my favorites,"The drunken pink elephant sequence went on WAY too long. And how about those black crows?Disney will release this, but NOT release Song of the South? Doesn't make sense!"
3,not his best work,"It is Disney,so it entertains kids well.But..this is definately not disney's best.The story line is sparse and the flow of the action is jerky.The music is memorable and my son enjoys them all except for pink elephants on parade.It goes on too long and the animation that goes with it scares him.Worth owning,but not a must have."
4,Sad but still a classic,"Come on people. Get over your fears that your child will be permanently scarred and/or a juvenile delinquent just becuase they watch something that isn't totally sugar-coated, and then show them a great movie like this. I'll admit, this is undoubtedly one of the saddest movies in my memory, but that doesn't change the fact that it is a classic and should be a part of every kid's life. Disney movies are such a huge part of my life, I don't know what I'd be like if I was banned from watching them. Whatever, it's your decision and everything, but all this censorship is only going to make things go more down the toilet than they already have."
2,Terrible for kids-probobly okay for adults,I saw this movie when I was five years old. My parents had to turn it off when I started crying. It's too scary for kids and if you really want to watch this movie watch it without your kids.
2,mean spirited,"As a disabled woman I can wholeheartedly recomend such Disney movies such as Finding Nemo but have a hard time recomending Dumbo. Dumbo was made fun of by everyone except the crows and his mother in the movie and was treated cruely. In the end, the thing that made everyone like Dumbo was when they found out Dumbo could fly. So if Dumbo never learned to fly they would have never considered him worth treating nice? Cruddy message."
2,"Bad DVD, Good customer service","Unfortunately the Dumbo DVD that I ordered for my daughter and I didn't work when we received it. It skipped and froze throughout. However, when I contacted the seller about the problem, he was very prompt in his response and very helpful. I sent the DVD back and I was issued a refund. It was a bummer that we don't have the DUMBO dvd to enjoy, but I was thankful that it wasn't a problematic situation to deal with. Thank you to the seller for helping to make this an easy process!"
2,How the mind plays tricks.,"I was so excited to rent this video and watch it with my son. I didn't remember it being so racist. I was incredibly saddened as we sat through it, hoping that my son wouldn't pick up on all the slurs against people of color. I agree with many other reviewers that this movie is a classic, it is just a shame that it was socially acceptable to make this kind of statement at that point in time."
3,"Good, yes... however...","Sure, it's a good tale. However, one thing you might consider before letting your children watch it is how dark this movie is. This movie is an exploration of some of the more darker and vile aspects of the human psyche. It is an animated meditation on abuse, slavery, and mistreatment. As such, it may disturb not only the children watching it, but the parents as well. Think twice about this one. There is also the very weird scene where Dumbo gets stinking drunk on alcohol and has ""hallucinations."" Yes, you should very much think twice about this one as a parent."
2,Do not purchase this video for children,"I was shocked that Disney would make such a horrible movie for children. It is loaded with social and cultural stereotypes and constantly shows animals caged, doors slamming on animals, and even shows the ringmaster whipping Dumbo's mother with a large black whip. My two-year old was very scared. More than that, I was offened by the song ""Roustabouts"". The men who put up the circus tent at night sing this song. First of all, they are all black men putting up the tent. If you listen to the words of the song, they are singing about "" we don't read or write"" and ""when we get our pay we throw our pay away."" Also, the black crows in the movie clearly have black accents. I know my two-year old doen't pick up on this, but I don't want her watching this kinds of movie over and over again. The only saving grace in this video is the loving relationship between Dumbo and his mother. I don't like this video and am VERY sorry that I bought it. A big disappointment Disney!"
1,Horrible,"Okay so I love the movie, but i dont like the seller. It took over 2 nights just for them to ship it out. I needed this for my granddaughter before the 12th and they say it wont arrive till the 31st? WTF!? She enjoyed this classic on VHS but she wanted the DVD, so far it just shipped, it better be here before the 15th at max."
1,"Dark, Scary, and Inappropriate for Toddlers","I bought this video based on a couple of very enthusiastic customer reviews, and I was so disappointed! My two year old was frightened by the darkness and mean-spirited behavior of every character in this movie. From a toddler's perspective, and from my own, ridicule, circus cruelty, a house on fire (in the clown scene, elephants falling from great heights, and drunkeness are not funny, entertaining, or good teaching aids for children. I get the whole thing about kids being picked on for any diferences they might possess, good or bad, but this is really presented on a more mature level than children are ready for. As I watched this movie, I was reminded of seeing it in the theater when I was about seven or eight, and being very upset by the experience. I wish I had remembered that before buying this from Amazon, as I cannot return it opened. Parents might consider renting and previewing this one before purchasing."
5,Great Condition,I received my video and it was like new in perfect condition. I was very satisfied with my purchase of a used item on Amazon.
5,Dumbo,arrived in plenty of time for Christmas. Was loved by the receiver of this gift. Great childhood memories watching this. Thanks
3,Dumbo,I like Walt Disney movies and have started to collect them for when friends with kids come to visit. Thanks
3,A classic but video quality a little lacking,"If you haven't seen Dumbo at least once, you should. It's a touching Disney classic. I've seen it many times and though it's not my favorite, it has some really good scenes. Unfortunately the streaming quality wasn't the best when I rented it."
5,Dumbo,"This movie brought back childhood memories. But, it is not just a children's story. I liked watching this movie very much. Color was excellent. Classic Disney."
5,DVD - Dumbo,Great classic movie that can be shared with the entire family. Animation and color is wonderful as you would expect from this Disney vintage movie.
5,Love this elephant!,"Dumbo is another timeless classic that can't be beat. It's sad for a while, but happy endings always prevail! We just love this big-eared little fella."
4,Dumbo VHS,I am happy with the product. Although the case is definitely worn the movie still plays good and that is all that matters. Thanks
4,Dumbo in Sarasota,"The cd said ""70 aniversario"", so I feared it might have a Spanish track. Even though it was a gift for a grandson, I opened it and checked it out. It was in English all right. I had not seen it for sixty years, but it is as touching as ever. Now that we have retired to Sarasota, FL, I was fascinated by the circus background which is so much part of the history here, The station where the train leaves from is the former Sarasota station. The Circus Museum at the Ringling Museum of Art has a miniature circus and lots of posters and costumes. Circus Sarasota is a one-ringed circus under a Big Top.I was looking at the movie from a 4 year old's perspective and think that the story will be very powerful for him, but that the Parade of the Elephants sequence will go on too long. His artist father will appreciate the graphics though."
4,Dumbo (big top edition),This movie is a wonderful addition to my daughters collection. She loves watching Dumbo fly. We read her the stories first so she was really into the movie when it came.
2,Not worth the upgrade if you already have the 60th Anni. ED...,"Don't get me wrong, Dumbo is a great movie for kids and adults, one of Disney's greatest films but everything went wrong in this SO CALLED ""Big Top Edition""First of all, it isn't even a 2-disc set!Most of the old ""60th Anniversary Edition"" bonus features are put on this DVD taking out some of the making, Dumbo II preview, and a music video. I do not understand Disnet AT ALL!The new transfer IMO is WORSE then the ""60th Anniversary Edition"" It has no life to it, it is darker and very dull. Also you are losing 30% of the film do to an overscan! This movie was already filmed in fullscreen why do a pan and scan job to a fullscreen DVD? Come on Disney, you get enough money!You really need this quick buck?If you already have the ""60th Anniversary Edition"" DVD please stick with it! You get to see the WHOLE movie in full and the colors are brighter and you have ALL the great bonus features!"
3,The BIG thing is that some of the extras on the previous DVD release are missing here.,"I don't know why Disney is doing this release, they have deleted some of the ""Making Of"" documentaries and bonus music videos that were on the ""60th Anniversary Edition"" DVD release.The few extra shorts on this disc were also on the previous ""60th Anniversary Edition"" DVD.Bottom line: Get the 30th Anniversary DVD release if you still can."
3,A Minor Classic,"I understand there are many sentimental parents and grandparents who treasure this movie. Well a 3 year old doesn't care about that; they just want to be entertained. With that as my only criteria, I have to give this 3 stars. The movie is rather slow paced compared to what kids are used to. And there are those now politically incorrect moments, too (specifically racial overtones). They don't bother me, but they could bother some people. We all agree it's a classic, but I doubt all of our kids would."
5,cute,Saw it for the first time... Really liked it only wished it was longer.. very heart warming story have to admit it made me tear up a bit :')
4,Great movie! A true timeless classic,"We checked this out of the library just because my little one loves elephants. Well, we've watched and watched and watched this one so much this week that we're going to have to buy the thing! It's such a cute movie. Albeit it's quite sad but it also shows that those who make and poke fun are usually the losers in the end. I love the crows - they're just so ornery in the beginning and I love how the main crow talks! It just cracks me up each time. And that song, ""When I See An Elephant Fly,"" is just great. I don't like the drinking scene either and don't really think it's necessary. They could have come up with another way to show that Jumbo Jr. could fly. (I don't care for the title either!) But, I told my little one that he was drinking pop and that's how he could blow bubbles. So, if you go that route, you can get by with it pretty easily.All in all, it's a great film and a true classic to add to your collection."
1,Not even worth the 39 cents,"This movie seems to have no point. It follows around a character called Antimatter that lives in the gutter and between drinking, drugging, and playing in her band she manages to find people to sleep with and steal from. Really not amusing or entertaining in the slightest. Available on Netflix if you really feel the need to torture yourself but you'll never get that hour plus back. Also be prepared for full frontal nudity."
4,"A Great, Fun Game","When Pharaoh first came out, to tell you all the truth, I didn't know anything about it. But then my best friend tells me about it (he got the demo), so I went to the website of Pharaoh and it looked pretty good. When I bought it, it turned out to be one of my favorite games, as there isn't a lot of violence, no shooting, no blood. And it's really fun. I don't know how else to put it. I really enjoyed Pharaoh, but when Cleopatra came out, I just went running to get it, and I didn't think it was as good as Pharaoh, but still really good, as it did have a couple of pretty cool features added on that Pharaoh didn't have."
3,Its pretty good,First of all you need egyptian background. you love the game for the first 2 months but after that youll have no intrest. It is a great game though its so real you trade with other cities and built monuments and basically build an egyptian city. 1 word of advice always keep seth happy
4,The perfect expansion to a perfect city builder,"The main purpose of an expansion is defined as: ""Add new and interesting features to the original version, which will in turn bring people back to the game.""Well, after I stopped playing Pharaoh for a while, just due to playing it some much I needed to regain my life back; I bought Cleopatra with the thought of playing Pharaoh again. It worked! Cleo adds some really neat buildings (I love the Zoo) plus a lot of hard missions. The new monuments are worth the price of admission, with a built tome, you can actually see inside! Thus the need of the new lamp makers :)A great expansion for the true Pharaoh fan."
4,Very well done,"What I enjoy most about Cleopatra are the ""new"" missions. Also the add-on's like the Zoo, Lamp Maker, and the different people you can trade with, made this game completely addicting. Also, I have to say, I love the ""Side Show"" cheat. I almost fell on the floor when I saw what it was. Try it, you'll get a laugh out of it, I promise."
5,"""A Feel Good After You Finish Reading It, novel.""","Angela Patrick Wynn created a character in Renea Peaks that every woman can identify with, and every man wants to meet. Her energy, enthusiasm, and determination, though flawed by inexperience, is contagious. I found myself rooting for her to make the right decisions when faced with challenge after challenge. When she made the wrong decisions I could empathize with her for trying so hard. The steady, handsome, A.J. was there for her and Brian every step of the way, even though he had his own demons to deal with. It was as if I was allowed to travel her jouney without her knowing I was there. That is the type of author I love to read.Other reviews have explained the storyline very well. I won't bother to go into it here. What I will say, is that when I finished reading it, I took it in both hands, held it to my heart, and sighed. Then, I raised it up to the heaven's and said: ""YES!"" You have to be there -- that means you have to read it for yourself."
5,Terrific enlightning story about choices and responsibilites,ok now this is a wonder story...it was like a second skin to me..i was on renea's side until i saw that she didnt really care about her brother...she did dont get me wrong but she always wanted someone to guide her around when it came to her brother...but when she was doing her own thing...school and work..she was on top of everything...it doesnt go like that rather this is a work of fiction or a fact. its easy to say i would never do that but being a parent i know that i would give up my dreams for my son and family any day because it will still be there but not my family...this story really touch me and dont we all need an A.J. in our life *S* thank you ms wynn for writing an unforgetable novel *S*
5,Finally!,"Thank you, Ms. Wynn, for finally providing the public with an intelligent, well-developed, CLEAN book for the '90s women. I had a great time getting to know Renea and AJ, which is something so rare in much of today's literature. Both of these characters represent yet another strong side of the African-American community that is sometimes lost in the drama of the world today. I cheered with them, cried with them, and sometimes got angry with (OR at) them. It was well worth the read! I personally thank you for this well-written book and look forward to your next endeavor!"
4,"Good, interesting read",Overall this was a very good book. Nice character development. I wish Renea could have gotten a better revenge on Pam.
1,It didn't work for me.,"I have ""stubborn"" grays and it didn't cover them as the product described. My hair is about 70% gray and brown."
2,Useless for verbs,"The English-to-Greek side is 50% larger than the Greek-to-English side, which is not what English speakers speaking Greek will want. The table of irregular verbs only gives the aorist (simple past), active and passive, and the past participle. So if the imperatives are irregular, there is no way to find them using this dictionary. And if the dependent (which forms the perfective subjunctive and perfective future) is irregular, as it often is, there is no way to find it either. So if you want to say, ""I want to see it"", then, since that requires the perfective subjunctive, you cannot find the right form of the verb ""to see"". Likewise, if you want to say, ""I would like to eat that"", you cannot find the right form of the verb ""to eat"". And if you want to say, ""Please give me that"", you cannot find the right form of the verb ""to give"". And if you see these words and want to know what they mean, you cannot look them up."
3,Oxford Greek Dictionary(Pocket),"It is good for bginners .Personally,I would have preferred a more detailed dictionary,one that lists not only the basic words,but also their declensions and conjugations.I think that at a later stage in my study of the Greek language,I will have to have a more detailed version,in order to cope. I would like to add that when I bought this dictionary I had hardly a clue about modern Greek.Now I know what I need."
4,Greek Language Dictionary,The book is easy to read and understand. Very helpfull for students wanting to learn a new language.
2,The Pocket Oxford Greek Dictionary : Greek-English English-Greek,Hard to understand.... I wish the would have the words in English and in Greek so I could know what I am reading.... Not worth what I paid for it....
2,NOT WHAT I EXPECTED,"I thought it would have ENGLISH/GREEK, but since unforunately I don't knowthe Greek alphabet I was disappointed."
4,Greek Dictionary,"There are several definitions to all greek words and so it is extremely difficult to include them all in one book, but Oxford has done it.I hope everyone finds this as helpful as I have"
5,Among His Best,"It can be both edgey and accessible in a strange sort of way. I owned this originally in High School on 8 track, which I probably paid a buck or less for in the almighty bargain bin (Remember those good ones with cut outs before they were loaded with pre-fab budget greatest hits releases). That tape was my intro to the Captain, although it is long gone I just got a used copy of the LP at a local record store, and I must say that this record is even better than what I remembered from twenty years ago.I love the title cut; it used to get played often on Towson State's radio station back when this was new.Other favorites are ""Tropical Hot Dog Night"", ""Harry Irene"", and ""Floppy Boot Stomp""(the title always made me think of a friend of mine's worn out Sunny's Surplus work boots that he just wouldn't throw away). After just hearing it again I must conclude that this is an essential Beefheart release"
5,Captain Beefheart. RIP,"There are some interesting tracks on this cd ,as usual all the Captains albums were so different,This in includes Harry Irene,which is a fantastic track and of course Bat Chain Puller. I feel that if are into Beefheart you would have to own this cd."
5,Zoot Horn Rollo,The Captain at his best. The blues reinterpreted from Outer Space.Where is he when we need him?
4,Finally! Something fresh and fun!,"In a world of same old, same old video games, it's a pleasure to play a game that is unique and fun. There is really no other games like this around.I was suprised to see how effectively the two game types could be combined so effectively. The balance between the them is executed very well, though it is challengeing to get the coordination of the sending the pinball (the odama) into action and guiding your soldiers to victory. At least at first.I have read other reviews in other places that hack on the ""poor"" graphics, but I honestly don't think it's poorly executed graphics as much as they went for a look that resembled medievel Japanese art. I personally like the look of the game.If you are a gamer who actually enjoys fun and innovative games, and is tired of the endless stream of first person shooters, racing games and criminal thug games, give it a try. Kudos to Nintendo for trying to bring true fun and gaming back from the dead!"
2,Not sure what I was looking for but this isnt it,The FAme Game is as much hype as Hollywood. Not worth wasting the words on but dont waste your money either. Lots of hype and no substance for sure
2,Fun souvenier/poor instrument,"This nay flute makes a fun souvenier, but a poor musical instrument. It is not made of a single piece of bamboo or reed as nay flutes are supposed to, but rather have several bamboo segments glued together, decreasing the sound quality. It is also not a scaled instrument, so playing traditional nay music is almost impossible. However, if you want a pretty flute to display that is also inexpensive, this could what you are looking for."
3,quite enjoyable,"i myself am a huge fan of domingo. Though this book proves why he is a singer and not a writer, it is a great chance to sit back and learn more not just about domingo but about his opinions of himself. and remember, this book was published 17 years ago, and as much as he has done in his ""first 40 years"", he has not slowed down one bit... so hopefully he is in the process of writing his ""last 20 some years since my first book."" a good read for the die hard fan who wants to know more than ""he is one the 3 tenors who became famous for his othello."""
3,not worth the price,"pros: can communicate at least 2 miles in city;speaker is bigger, so volume is higher.cons: too big (heavy);the belt clip is easy to break;didn't communicate well with other brand products;battery didn't last long even it's so heavy;one adapter was defective when I received it. But amazon replaced one for me pretty quickly."
2,Motorola T7400R GMRS,"Nice pieces of equipment, but not what I was led to believe. They delivered what they promised, EXCEPT FOR THE RANGE. No, I did not expect ""12 miles"" of range, even within a line of site. I came into this deal expecting and requiring a range of only two miles as the crow flies to communicate with other parties. Unfortunatly, all the Moto's could muster was 7 tenths of a mile through light foilage (pine trees). Nice two-way radio's, but unless you are within a line of site, forget their promise of distance. If you can see the target, then you will connect. If not, use your cellular."
2,NOT SO GREAT AS THEY SAY.JUST OK,These radios look nice but there are some problems here. First the batteries do not last long unless you do not talk. Second the biggest problem for me was uncompatibility with other radios and brands. The receive quality is very poor and hard to understand at times. I also hace a T7200 and the difference is like night and day. The 7200 is the best. The 7400 i believe is an has flaws and that is why you see them priced so low. I paid $24.00 on ebay and also have seen the set at home depot clearance for $44.00 today. What good is any radio if you cant understand what someone is saying? Good try motorola but this is a poor product.NOT RECOMMENDED TO PURCHASE.
5,These are the Motorolas to get!,"I've used many models of Motorola FRS radios, and I think these are the best. They're slightly larger than most because they hold 4 AA batteries, but they perform better than most others. Also, because of the slightly larger size, the speaker is a little bigger and sounds fuller, which helps you to hear incoming transmissions better. Highly recommend."
4,"Great product, convenient.",The radios were purchased for a school to have in their classrooms. The individual docking/charging stations are hard to find but Amazon carried them and they were resonably priced.
2,Get another two way radio from Motorola,I recommend getting a Radio that has internal chargeable batteries; this one will run out of battery when you need it most.
1,This item is NOT Available,"After six weeks of waitng and exchange numerous e-mails with Amazon staff, I finally recieved a message that this item has not yet been released by the manufacturer, and Amazon will notify me when it becomes available. Ignore the 2-3 day shipping above and the 41% of people who bought this item. It is all untrue they don't have it haven't sold any and don't know when they will. I will change this review when and if my order is delivered."
1,So not available in 2-3 weeks,"I ordered this radio back in May and I still don't have them. It is now September. I have exchanged several emails with Amazon, the first one I received a very nice but untrue reply. The second response was borderline rude but at least honest, they told me that they don't have the product and don't know when they will. If you are looking for something to use now, don't waste your time with ordering this radio."
2,serch put it well.,"It just wasn't very funny.I agree with pretty much everything serch said.Not a big laugh to be found here, there's some kay spots though.The Lisa story is just bad."
1,Did not work!,"I opened these December 23rd to do a little last minute Martha Stewart. However, neither string would work. I caught mayself before I through them across the room and remembered I have always been happy with Amazon and their customer service. I am hoping I can still return these. Disappointed but not discouraged!"
1,Still Waiting,"Since I still have not received this item, over a month after purchasing it, I am unable to review it fairly. However, the seller has not lived up to my expectations. When can I expect to receive it?"
3,not what i expected,"This toy is a great toy, don't get me wrong, but I was very disappointed when I took it out of the box only to learn that the drawings on the package were incorrect. The box shows Logan with elbows bent, springing his claws out as he brings his arms down at his sides (a classic Wolverine maneuver as any X-Men fan will tell you). However, the actual toy's arms are locked in place with the elbows bent. There is no joint at the elbow as depicted in the drawing. I was very upset with the ToyBiz corporation for their false advertisement."
1,More like a statue,"This toy has almost zero articulation, and is made of very hard plastic. The pop-out claw feature on one of his arms didn't work on mine. The ""x-ray machine"" accessory isn't all that great either. Bad toy."
5,Half a sixpence the movie,I first saw this movie when it first came out many years ago. I was just thrilled with the story about two separated young lovers who meet again years later. The music and dancing is wonderful. I have probably see this movie 8 or more times and am always drawn back to the story and the dancing and music. After seeing it I can spend days humming the songs and remembering the story through the songs. I don't think it get the praise it deserved.
4,A heart-warming tale about what really is important in life.,"I recently watched this video again and I had forgotten how truly nice it was to watch two people who love each other, find out the true meaning of that love, and what our riches really are. I even remembered the songs, and delighted in the dance scenes. Just a fun movie with a terrific lesson to be learned that you cannot buy your happiness. Tommy Steele is fun to watch. I hope he is still dancing!"
3,Worth the price. Fun for the whole family.,"Sit back and enjoy this one with the kids. Sure, call me a sentimentalist, but after viewing this film, I went out with my best friend, found a foreign coin, and cut it in half. We each went our separate ways over the years, but my half of the coin still brings back a flood of warm memories."
5,A2J,You don't often get the privilege of listening to awesome melodies and musicianship and at the same time being ministered to by deep and thought provoking lyrics. A2J is an album that is full of songs that speak to people right where they are. These guys really seem to have a heart for God.
5,A highly enjoyed CD,"I first heard According to John on the radio and immediately took a liking to their song ""Justified"". Later on I borrowed the CD from my friend and listened to it. I enjoyed every song the CD contained. Their sound is really great. I love how they can be edgy on one song and gentle on the next. Their tunes are well written and the lyrics are focused God. You can get so much out of their songs and experience something moving in the music. I definitely recommend this CD to everyone!"
1,Shanked it,"I'm sorry, but am I slow? I found no memorable lines or sections that could even remotely categorize this book as laugh-out-loud funny or even giggle, ha-ha humorous. This book went absoultely nowhere, and frankly I could only make it 100 pages in before I had had enough. As a golfing male, I could relate to the experiences of Mr. Geist, but I just didn't see the humor in anything. Although fiction, read Rick Reilly's Missing Links or Dan Jenkins' Dead Solid Perfect for an understanding of what true hackers are like."
2,Not for more than a couple of kids.,"I didn't think this book was as useful as some others. The pump is too hard to use and you can't make even half of the hats with the balloons they give you because most of these hats require more than one balloon. If you are planning to use it for hats at a party, you will spend too much time on each one and the kids will be too impatient."
2,Not very good!,"This book was not very good: pictures ( black and white),ideas ( not creative). I would not recommend it to anyone."
4,Excellent gift for the Western movie buff!,"I bought this gift for my Dad. He is extremely difficult to buy for and hardly ever gets excited, but he LOVED this book! He couldn't put it down!"
1,I don't recommend this book to anyone interested in Nanotechnology,"There are two main reasons why I don't recommend this book to anyone. The first, and most annoying, reason is readability. This book was written horribly. Many times I found myself struggling to understand what the author wanted to say. This book requires a great deal of editing. I managed to go through some of it, but I just couldn't continue.The second and very important reason is the structure of the book. The author digs into details without giving the big picture. Although the details are not that technical, but they lack perspective. I got lost in the details without understanding the reason behind them.One other thing I didn't like, but wasn't a big factor in my decision to stop reading the book was some of some examples. Sometimes the examples didn't convey the idea well enough. They weren't thought out well enough."
2,Technology will not solve your problems,"This was an optimistic and over simplified book that seems to ignore thermodynamics. I think this author is a member of the ""grey goo"" group."
2,Mr. Hall needs an editor.,"I can't give this book more than two stars, and that's being generous.Mr. Hall does present some interesting ideas, but unfortunately, his editors have done him a huge disservice. Here are the first three sentences of Stage I, on page 23;Essentially what we have now--nanoscale science and technology--including the ability to image at the atomic scale with scanning probe microscopes, and a very limited ability to manipulate, that is, by pushing things around with the same scanning probes. A scanning probe is essentially like feeling something with a stick. Because you have a computer behind it, you can touch it in a very close grid of points and produce a picture.I made it through the first fifty pages, and it didn't get any better.I don't know if Mr. Hall had a final read before publication, or not, but someone should have stopped this book from being published until it was properly edited.t"
2,No one is an expert on everything...,"While nanotechnology (especially the version defined/described in this book) definitely has the potential to revolutionize many facets of our lives, it is hard to believe that Dr. Hall is an expert on all of the topics he covers in this book. For example, within the space of 288 pages, Dr. Hall manages to expound on everything from aerodynamics and aircraft design (p.162-163) to the basic ideology and driving forces of terrorism (p. 232-233). As a result, ""Nanofuture"" comes off more as the ramblings of an individual rather than a thoroughly researched and objective assessment of nanotechnology."
4,Excellent resource on Shinto,"I don't understand what ""a customer"" is saying referring to ""the British flag"" on the cover. Huh? The cover is clearly illustrated using draped panels and a bell, stand, cushion and ringer. Emblematic of Shinto, which uses bells and tones to purify and to call in the kami. A Popular Dictionary of Shinto is an excellent resource, collating the terminology of Shinto in a concise book. Like all good dictionaries is is an education on its subject, providing the annotations which will enable students and enthusiasts of Shinto and/or Japanese culture, history and society to learn its spiritual terrain."
1,All About the British Class System,This book is very informative about the decline of Western educational standards but doesn't say much about Japan's nationalist religion. What's with the british flag on the cover?
2,Helpful but very outdated,"When this book was released in 1998, it was a very helpful resource that made the navagation of the L.A. private school morass less complex and far less stressful. My problem with the book today lies simply in the fact that it has not been updated in five years and much of the information about the schools in the book is quite outdated. Whether it be enrollment figures, tuition costs, or even the very culture of many of the schools themselves, much has changed in Los Angeles private schools since this book was published just as much has changed in Los Angeles. A new edition reflecting these many changes is long overdue and hopefully forthcoming."
2,Limited View of LA schools,"This book lists many of the well known private schools in the LA area, however it omits many others. Even when describing the schools selected, more information is given about the better known schools. The information in this book is also very out of date. I suggest getting this book from a library."
2,Not Very Helpful,"I was hoping that this book would be a guide for finding a private school for my child. Instead, it was grossly inadequit and listed only a small number of L.A. schools, (usually the most expensive)omitting many of the Montessori and preschools. It went into great detail about the schools that it listed, but I would have prefered to have more choices."
2,Plate chipped when it touched another bowl in the closet.,"Beautiful pattern but the plate must have been defective or cracked when shipped. Placed it in the closet and it touched the bowl and it chipped. I have an eight place setting of this pattern and have had no problems with any of the other pieces. Update: Pfaltzgraff has excellent customer service! They replaced the chipped plate totally free of charge including free shipping. You can't beat that. So, we showed our appreciation and purchased a set of marguerita glasses. Great product and outstanding customer service."
3,Slow-moving,"Personally, I though this book was a disappointment. It doesn't move along, and the scenes are boring, without much action. The descriptions are good, but in this story there isn't much to describe. Sorry, for all you out there that like this story. I enjoy a fantasy story with lots of action, sword-fighting, magic, rescues. I don't like this book much because it doesn't have too much of that.Seriously, though, don't just take my word for it. You need to read this book for yourself, and draw your own conclusions."
4,Speed,"I just thought I'd point out that this is a sports camera with an amazing buffer + continuous shooting mode. Here are the specs:* Continuous High [CH] - 8 fps* Continuous Low [CL] -1 to 7 fps (programmable)* Buffer size 50 JPEG frames, 40 NEF (RAW) frames *THIS is the only reason to buy this camera over the D1X or D70. But if you're looking for a great studio camera, the D1X won't let you down, and if you're just getting into DSLR's, the D50/ D70 are great bodies to get started on.Thanks for reading!-Jason"
1,Great camera.. 5 years ago.,"This camera has been discontinued by Nikon and supersceded by the Nikon D2x which in turn was discontinued and superceded by the Nikon D3 and later the D3x. Both the D3 and D3x are current production models. The D3 has 12MP and the D3x has 24.5MP. This camera has a puny 4.1MP, which is less than my new cell phone camera. You can purchase a new Nikon D3 from Amazon for considerably less than the $5,987 being asked for this long since discontinued camera."
3,Buy it only if you're a journalist,"This camera is designed for journalists and journalists alone. 4 MP means that the maximum size you can make prints at 300 DPI is roughly 6"" x 8"". That's fine if you're submitting images to a newspaper, but if you have any chance of wanting enlargements you'll be better off with something with more resolution.Funny thing is that the Canon sports camera is roughly the same price and shoots 8.5 fps at 8.2 MP. I'm sure Nikon could do better, but perhaps there just isn't a market for Nikon sports cameras, I mean, look at the amount of white lenses on any mayor sporting event!"
1,Fathead does not stick to most walls,"It would have been nice to know that the Fathead decal does not stick to any walls with the slightest texture. Our wall is very lightly textured. We spent 10 minutes removing air pockets and in 5 minutes it was peeling off. This was a waste of $100.00. We have replaced the decal back on the original paper and rolled it back up in the box it came in. We are hoping to send it back or sell it to someone with smooth walls, assuming it will stick to smooth walls."
3,New to me,One of my friends had some of there stuff not as good as the ones he had.Thought this one would be better than it was.Beware there are 2 different covers for same disc this one is remastered and quality great a little head bangy for my taste.
5,i read this breafly but i was still amazed,"this book is phenomenal. though i wish i had more time to read this more throughly i've noticed some out of the box ideas involving the magnetic strength of a location by using a compass. for the most part this book is not for the stargazer wannabees, look elsewhere for that. over here you'll find handy ideas like using the wind to stir your boat if your alone, so you can busy yourself cooking or other neccessary work. he also uses the sun and mathematical approaches quite often to solve the problems of firguring out where you are in the world. i would say this is for the survivalist who want to go out to sea is the best way to describe the kind of person who would want to buy this book"
2,Book for kids,"Just book for kids, that's it. Almost totally irrelevant for adults interested in emergency navigation for any practical purpose. Also, as in many other similar books, the issues of celestial navigation in southern hemisphere are totally ignored."
2,Basically a kids book,Has some good information but it is written in a kids book type format with silly irrelavent tests and stories that don't relate at all to the subject matter. Would be good to teach kids from but if you have any celestial navigation experience and some common sense not really worth your time... probably entertaining for the armchair sailor.
4,Beneficial tea,"Raspberry leaf tea was recommended to me by friend who swore by it during pregnancy and for labour. I did my research and was doubtful it would do anything for my pregnancy as there is no scientific evidence that it induces labour or shortens the length of it.I was persuaded to try the tea after finding out the other health benefits on Mindful Mum - lessening bleeding gums and nosebleeds (nightmare!), calming morning sickness (which is has for me but doesn't work for everyone) and lots of vitamins (E, B1 and B3).Although it won't speed up labour or pregnancy, it's worth taking as a good supplement for vitamins."
2,Not for Everyone!,"I bought a box of this tea at my local Whole Foods. If you have never tried this tea, I recommend buying one box, like I did, rather than buying it in bulk here on Amazon. I am not pregnant, but I heard this tea had good benefits for all women of reproductive age (I'm in my late 20's). So I made a large cup of this tea and went on with my day. Within two hours of ingesting the tea, I had MAJOR uterine cramps. Now, I guess this might be what they euphemistically refer to as ""strengthening the female system"". I cannot imagine drinking this when I was 6 weeks pregnant, as it seems to basically cause contractions in me after one cup. I guess it will be useful at the end of the third trimester, especially if I'm past term. But for every day use, I don't like it. It's like having period cramps every day. Ugh."
5,Recommend this Product!,"I purchased this product to help with my menstrual problems. Although the issue is still unresolved, I still recommend this product! It has a great taste and i absolutely loove drinking a warm glass of this Yogi tea first thing in the A.M.!"
3,The tea needs something,"I drank this tea during the last part of my pregnancy for uterine health. I can't really say if it helped with my pregnancy/delivery (although I did have a 4 hour labor). The tea doesn't taste bad, but it doesn't taste great either. Some cinnamon and honey helped spice up the tea."
4,Yogi raspberry leaf tea,I ordered this tea to drink while pregnant because I have heard it helps with labor. I haven't gone into labor yet but it's good tea and nice to have a warm drink.
5,"Great Item, Service & Price","If you are drinking this tea daily then I highly suggest the automatic shipping. You get a great price, free shipping and the convenience to know that you are never out."
5,LOVE THIS TEA!,"I love this tea! I used to have such bad periods that I was bent over screaming, throwing up and crying so hard. No medication could help me calm down at all. I got this tea and started drinking it the day I got my period and within 3 to 10 sips I had no more cramps at all. Now I drink it 10-5 days before a period and I have no more cramps, no more screaming and crying or anything. I LOVE this tea! It is a gift to all females who have bad menstrual cycles! I want to start drinking it when I do get pregnant and try to have a natural birth."
5,I get the worst cramps and this tea is a life saver,"This tea doesn't taste much like raspberries to me but it i a great help during my monthly period pains. Without this tea I get pain so bad that I can barely stand and have broken into sweats from the pain (I don't usually sweat easily). Since I can't take most pain relievers due to a bad stomach I decided to look for something holistic. I try to take it when I know my period is coming I take this tea a my pain is mostly gone but it only takes like 20mins to work if that day comes before I expect. If you get bad cramps, I highly recommend you try this tea!"
5,Wonderful album,"I heard K.T. Tunstall on NPR and immediately got this album. It is lively, interesting, well performed. I hope this young lady goes far, very far."
4,Nice Surprise!,"I liked both the songs that were on the radio so, I figured there might be at least a couple more songs worth listening - I was surprised that every song was a really good song. It gets a little too mellow for me in the middle of the album, but overall I can listen to this beginning to end and it makes me very happy."
3,Does little to separate herself,"KT has great voice, set to a great acoustic tone, but if you asked me to identify one of her songs on the radio, I probably couldn't do it. Tunstall does little to separate herself from the likes of Natasha Bedingfield, Jewel, Nelly Furtardo and others like them."
2,"Is there a Black Horse and the Cherry Tree /Suddenly I See single?...oops too late, already bought the cd :S","I like the songs ""Black Horse and the Cherry Tree"" and ""Suddenly I See"" a lot, but i thought i'd give this cd a listen to see if there were any other songs i liked. The other songs are catchy, but it's not my kinda style of music. My parents like this type of music/KT's songs, but i'm not a fan."
4,Don't be afraid to check this one out,"Read the reviews, and if you're tempted by the comparisons, go for it. This is a pretty great debut; I'd give it 4 1/2 stars if I could. Some of the comparisons are valid, but they really serve mostly to give you some idea of her sound. I think she sounds really fresh and not much like anybody else, a neat trick considering the territory, which is mostly singer-songwriter and 70's rock. The production is superb; there's a real snap to the rockers, and some surprisingly fresh touches. The songwriting is pretty great, too. I'm betting we hear a lot more from her in the future. Oh, and her voice is pretty great -- lots of soul, and very assured. And she really rocks. A very pleasant surprise."
4,A smörgsbord of music,"I first saw KT on MTV. It was the last half of ""Suddenly I see"" and it sounded really nice. Since my CD collection lacks good female artists, 90 some% are male singers for some reason I decided to try her CD. I LOVE it. She has a different sound to every song on the CD and all are good or great, not a single ""halfway"" song. Very unusual. I think it's hard to compare artists but if I had to I'd say she sounds a little like a mix between Norah Jones, a happy Dido, Laleh (a Swedish singer-songwriter) with a pinch of Catatonia and a whiff of countrypop. My personal favourite are ""Other side of the world"", ""Under the weather"", ""False alarm"" and ""Suddenly I see"". The latter makes you smile and you can't stay still. All the songs are awsome though. It's been playing almost non stop since I got it. BUY IT!!!!"
5,This CD'll grab you,"Quick:***KT's is best LIVE, but the tracks on the CD fix a base.***Every listen offers new discoveries -- previously unnoticed nuances and levels.***She's on the ""wrong side of 25"" and she's proving them all ever so wrong.Celebrate the Tunstallation!"
5,One of the best album's I have ever purchaed,"As we all know there is usually one or two songs we dislike on a cd. And you end up pushing the skip button on the cd player. This is not the case with Eye to the telescope. The first track Other Side Of The World is one of the best songs on the cd. Universe & U track number 7 and False Alarm track number 8 are tied for my favorite song on the record. The vocals on all tracks are fantastic. In a world of one hit wonders and pop star's who can't play and instrument or write thier own song's KT is a breath of fresh air. She's the real thing and she can prove it. She write's her own music, plays the guitar and sings. She has what it takes and she will be around for some time to come."
4,Great cd,"If you liked Katherine McPhee's performance on American Idol (...horse in a cherry tree with the guys on the bongo drums), then you will love this CD. KT Tunstall has a fresh sound."
3,"Doesnt have the ""x-factor""","this is a pretty album but i think people might like it. Thers no real sound to it and no real edge, which is shame because the album has potential to be very good. However i do dislike her as a human being, she seems to feel that the music industry is harder to penetrate for women than it is for men. B******s, just look at artists like Katie Meluia, Spears, Maddona the list goes on. Oh and shes Scottish lol."
1,A talented artist who's been diluted by TERRIBLE production,"I actually came across KT Tunstal on VH1, and decided to look her album up. Three songs are okay and the rest are total tripe, though looking on youtube her solo performances put them all to shame. Which is why I hate this album. They took someone who could be the next Janis Joplin or Ani Difranco.If you want an idea of the difference between this album and how much talent Tunstal actually has, go to youtube, and type in her name. Look at her live solo stuff versus the videos and music she does with a backing band.This album is an attrocity, and should be stricken from social conciousness, as should her backing band for crimes against humanity. If the next album she comes out with is neither live solo acoustic or solo studio work, I'm washing my hands of her."
1,Commercial Sell-out,"Tunstall has joined the long list of ""performers"" who have sold out to advertising. And for a bank, no less. The very institution that tries everything legal (but not ethical) to take your money. Want to hear Tunstall's music? Just listen to a Chase Manhatten commercial. Or better yet, rip a copy from a friend. Screw you Tunstall, you're a copout."
1,R U Guys Crazy?!,"In that ""Black Horse And A Cherry Tree"" song the HORSE proposes to her...and that's why she says ""no no no no"" How can you like something like that?! That's the DUMBEST lyric in a song EVER""But the big black horse looked this way and said hey little dame will ya marry me. But I said no no no no no no no, you're not the one for me""HAHAHA that's major lameness"
2,Copy controlled! Great Music - Poor Access,"I love K. T. Tunstall's music. But, I hate this album for what it doesn't allow me to do. It won't let me copy the music onto my hard drive. Since, I listen to music on my computer while traveling and in the office, this is a real inconvenience. Hopefully, the US version, when released, won't have this feature. I'm guessing this prevents loading onto ipods, mp3 players, etc., although I haven't tried it. The jewel case also mentions possible problems on car CD players!!"
3,Good debut,"KT has an unusual sound and many of her songs are very catchy. My only problem with this album is that some of her songs get old after repeated listens even to the point where they become annoying. Also, I did not love the entire album and found myself skipping a few of the tracks when listening to the CD. But all in all, not a bad album and a very talented new artist."
4,A Great First Album,"I heard her on NPR and immediately ordered it. She is a very interesting new artist. A very clear voice; sweet, with a little of a blues edge to it. The songs are well-thought out and fit the music. Usually, I don't like drum loops but this is one album where they fit and do not detract from the songs.She reminds me a lot of Bonnie Raitt. If she continues to write and sing this well, I look forward to hearing more of her on her subsequent work.This was a good purchase. It will be a while before this disc gets replaced in my player."
4,Wow,"I first heard KT's track ""Black Horse and the Cherry Tree"" on the radio and found it rather catchy. I got her album and was very impressed. Her music is similar to Rachael Yamagata and Sarah McLachlan and there is no doubt she has a beautiful voice. Her tracks are also great if you play guitar and/or piano and like to sing along. A few of those tracks have a really groovy and catchy beat/tune that makes this album stand out. Keep your eyes on KT Tunstall."
3,By SAS,"Great voice. One of my favorite songs on the CD is 'Heal Over'. The lyrics hit home. Love, life, loss, longing, searching.... I'm entertained and I'm glad I bought it."
4,A New Landslide!!! KT!,"KT Tunstall came into my hands while I was catching up Jewel's new record and I almost went up to need a very odd singer with indie winds and pop - slash - rock influences. This albums comes across with simplified sounds and a very natural string sound except on elaborated first single ""Black Horse and Cherry Tree""My favourite song is ""Other Side Of The World"" along with hiatus ""Suddenly I See"". Songs like ""Universe & U"" and ""False Alarm"" goes on the recently played area and other substancial songs ""Silent Sea"" and ""Through The Dark"".An album which sound is going from Kate Bush to a very country Sheryl Crow. This album is way too good. Must be a definetly everyone's cd collection."
5,This music makes it fun to go through your everyday!!!,"First time I came across KT Tunstall, was after watching the movie the Devil Wears Prada, which I loved for the fast-paced reality it portrayed and that I myself live in everyday. I basically loved all the music in it and was looking to buy the soundtrack originally but came across the wird fact that one of my favorite songs of the movie WAS NOT actually in the soundtrack so I decided to do some research and came across TD Tunstall.I herd the amazon samplers and pretty much found I loved her entire album, so I ended up buying it and loving it everyday.This is a definite must buy for the busy business woman trying to make her day a a fun one.Higly recommended."
3,Study,"This CD isn't the liveliest thing in the world. However, it has its own flair that makes it really cool. It's one of my fav CDs to study by."
5,Original!,KT Tunstall is one of the first completely original artists I have heard and enjoyed in a very long time. I bought the import before she became popular in the U.S. after hearing her on Virgin Radio online. Great collection of varied tunes with consistent performances. I look forward to hearing more.
4,Tunstall Amazes,"Don't let the cowboy stomp of ""Black Horse & The Cherry Tree"" fool you, this is no country singer. This Scottish lass proves, on her debut Eye To The Telescope, that legwarmers, a low voice and some rock thrash can go along way.Her album is filled with luscious tunes from the second single ""Other Side Of The World,"" with its subtle demeanor to the ""Stoppin' The Love.""Standouts include the lonesome ""Under The Weather"" and the superbly put-together ""Suddenly I See.""The lyrics are not strapping, wavering between straight talk to that of middling nature. The arrangement is what graces this effort. Tunstall rocks out without being too shrill or too acoustic. The blend of rock instrumentation makes this the finicky endeavor that it is.KT Tunstall has released a profound record that feeds a niche that has been hungry since the hay day of Lilith Fair."
5,A treasure that I never tire of,"When a friend first introduced me to KT Tunstall, I was pleasantly surprised as I am always on the lookout for new unique musicians. After listening to a few of her songs it was nearly impossible to stop humming the catchy and soulful lyrics that really pinpoint so many emotions. I ventured out to buy ""Eye to the Telescope"" and have not been disappointed for one second. It is one of the few CDs that I can listen to all the way through and enjoy every song.My particular favorites are ""Another Place to Fall,"" ""Under The Weather,"" ""Silent Sea,"" ""Heal Over,"" and ""Through the Dark."" Whether I'm in the mood for something delicate and slow, or something upbeat with a kick, KT's got it covered.It's not easy to find a truly talented female artist these days, who has more to offer than just her voice.As my friends and I like to say, KT Tunstall is the best thing that happened when a girl was handed a guitar."
3,let the heart do all the talkin',"Hot on the heels of James Blunt's textbook stateside breakthrough comes Scottish lass KT Tunstall, whose debut album Eye to the Telescope has sold over a million copies abroad and who two weeks ago put herself on the American map with a sizzling performance of her killer first single ""Black Horse and the Cherry Tree"" on ""The Today Show."" Triple-A radio has been all over this for weeks now, and shockingly, top forty is slowly getting on board. Shocking, because mainstream radio is all about formula right now, and ""Black Horse"" (much like the rest of Telescope, particularly the riff-y ""Universe and U"") doesn't fit a single mold: it's a little bit country, a little bit blues, a little bit rock `n roll, and a boatload of brilliant."
5,Musical Journey,"The reason I purchased this CD was because I fell in love with the song ""Suddenly I See"" which was used in ""The Devil Wears Prada"". I also enjoyed ""Black Horse and the Cherry Tree"" and decided to dive in and purchase the CD. To my surprise,I was blown away! Everytime I listen to ""Eye To The Telescope"", I can't seem to turn it off until I listen to the entire CD. If you are expecting more songs like ""Black Horse"" and ""Suddenly"", you will not find them. KT takes you on a musical journey where each song is an individual in it's own right. At the same time, the songs offer a smooth transition from one to the next and were placed in the perfect order. Tunstall has a gorgeous tone to her voice and pours her soul into these songs. I would have to say that ""Eye To The Telescope"" will make a wonderful addition to any music collection."
2,mediocre,"Two great hits, filled with one or two other mediocre songs, and 8 or 9 disposable, filler songs. I like KT, but she even tries to sing a song not within her vocal abilities. Beautiful song, that she doesn't quite sing right. It is also greatly underproduced (except for the two hits).Get the singles, forget the album."
4,K.T. - rates right up there with.....,Bonnie Raitt & Cherly Crow in my book. This collection of songs grows on you. Worth the purchase.
3,Another female singer-songwritter... wooh hooh!,"She's okay. She has talent, and she's cute. But come on! We keep getting the same package presented to us over and over. I'm not hating on the girl, 'cause she does her thing, and does it well. But she's not better than other similar people out there. Fortunately, she's a great songwriter, so she's selling albums & will make money for the rest of her life."
5,Love her!!!,Received this ahead of time and in perfect condition! GREAT CD!!! I've wanted this one for a long time. Finally got around to getting it. LOVE IT SO MUCH!!! Thank you!
5,So exciting to get 2 CD and a DVD in one purchase,I was looking for Eye to the Telescope and in this purchase I get 2 of her CD's. I was surprised and pleased.
5,Outstanding...,"Wow! What a treat! This is one of those CD's that you buy for one song and EVERY song ends up being great! KT takes you through a stream of emotions and styles that are so perfectly ordered that you take a ride with her that covers just about every emotion you can think of. From mellow to jumping for joy, this is the first of many of KT's CD's I will own."
4,KT makes beautiful music,"I bought Eye to the Telescope for the popular song Black Horse and the Cherry Tree. I found I like the rest of the songs more than that one. The whole CD is wonderful. I was really pleasantly surprised. Her lyrics are beautiful and so is her voice. There isn't a song on this CD that I dislike. It's a mellow CD, not many of the songs are as upbeat as Black Horse and the Cherry Tree. Very good music! She made a fan of me."
4,Definitely not Dido,"So, I'm sitting in Barnes and Noble reading and suddenly this ethereal beautiful voice comes out of the speakers throughout the store. For a brief millisecond I thought ""Oh, Dido has a new CD"" but then I started paying close attention.On ""Eye To The Telescope,"" KT Tunstall gives us some blues, some pop, some retro, and not a lick of whiny self-centered complaining that seems to be de rigueur for female singers these days. KT has a marvelously expressive voice, which she uses brilliantly without ever taking it too far. While listening to this CD I got flashes of Ricki Lee Jones, Shelby Lynne (the GOOD album) Joni Mitchell and even a little Carole King. However, that's not to say that KT is imitative in any way. She is absolutely fresh and original.If you like great lyrics matched with fine melodies and sung with sincerity and grace, give this CD a try."
4,Love it,"This is an awesome CD. KT Tunstall is one of the best new artists out there. Just so you know, the reason for this CD being cheaper than the other version is because it has some Spanish on the case (mine got shipped from Argentina). At least, that's the only reason I can see for the difference in pricing."
4,Black Horse is my favorite,"KT reminds me of early rock (maybe not like Janis) but she is really easy to listen to and is a joy to have her new CD. Black horse was the song that made me look at this CD, but there is so much more to enjoy.I am looking to purchase another of her earlier CD's."
5,KT Tunstall Eye to the Telescope,"It's a great CD. My favorite song is Black Horse and the Cherry Tree.Thank You,Courtney Wendel"
3,Copy Protected,The music is great. Refreshingly creative. The CD is copy protected which is not good for those consumers interested in exercising their fair use rights to put the real CD quality (1440 kbps) music on a more convenient medium. Too bad this practice hurts honest consumers in the name of thwarting the few who practice music pirating. A little computer savy and research however can get around the copy protection which makes it little more than an inconvenience. Pricing the product lower would be a more effective way to combat music pirating - ie. make it cheap enough that it's not worth the trouble to steal. The industry seems to be pretty ignorant overall with regard to their own product and their customers.
3,"OK, but she still seems to be searching for her own sound...","With a pleasant but less than stunning voice and a rhythmic strumming found throughout; Tunstall's work here recalls such influences as Aimee Mann and Sheryl Crow, but lacks Mann's depth of lyricism and Crow's vocal ability. It's listenable and with songs like ""Black Horse"" and ""Miniature Disaster,"" there's a few cuts that will stand up over time, but the overall effect is listenable but lacking the quality that will make it a regular on my playlist."
5,KT Tunstall Eye to the Telescope,"I absolutely love this DVD. I got it for one song--the only song I knew, ""Black Horse & the Cherry Tree""--and ended up crazy about the whole collection. Got it in great condition and in a timely manner. Thanks."
5,One of the best albums to date!,"Every song on this CD is awesome. It's been a long time since I could listen to a whole CD without skipping at least one song I didn't like... not this one, though! KT Tunstall is amazing and I can't wait for more!"
5,Best new artist I've heard .....,"....in a long time. I purchased this cd on the strength of these reviews. I can;t get away from her music! First I loved Another place to fall, then that was replaced by Suddenly I see....and on and on. I love her gritty voice mixed with the sweet pop. From beginning to end, this cd is terrific."
5,This album is epic!,"This album is epic. Each song is individual and a true gem. These songs are timeless, anyone could find enjoyment in this album. It isn't often that I find an album that I like every track on. Its not often that I find an album that I can listen to non-stop for over a year. This album fits those descriptions. It is going to be my go-to album for years to come. The lyrics are innovative and individual. You can clearly see that KT put her heart and soul into this album. The music is masterfully composed. This is more than a folk rock album, it is adult contemporary at its best.Don't base this album on its most popular single ""Black Horse and a Cherry Tree"". That is my least favorite song on the album. It stands out as very different from the rest of the tracks. The rest of the tracks are more mellow and haunting.Check it out!"
5,Great find,"I bought this CD just for the song Black Horse and a Cherry Tree; but found the entire CD to be excellent! I enjoyed it so much and at 62 years old was pleased that my granddaughters - 12 yrs. and 9 yrs. love it, too! It was such a pleasure to find a CD we could all enjoy listening to."
5,This is a very entertaining CD,KT Tunstall is a talented vocalist. She plays the guitar better than anyone I have heard in a long time. My favorite track is Black Horse and Cherry Tree. This song always makes me want to get up and dance. Her vocals are so sensual on this track. Other Side of The World is a romantic song about a long distance relationship that did not work out. Suddenly I See is a fun song about finding clarity and direction in life. Under The Weather is a pretty song about how a person's mood matches the weather. Miniature Disasters is a song about learning to be patient with yourself. This song is also about how little setbacks can really throw a person off track. KT sounds very honest and soulful on this song. Universe and U is a cute song about seeing the world through the eyes of a child. This is a simple and deep song. I really enjoyed this track. Eye To The Telescope is an entertaining CD by a talented musician.
5,Passion and intensity... a wonderful album,"For a 50 something like me to just flip for a new comer singer.. it takes alot.. I am a vocalist myself and.. well very hard to impress.. I find most young artists all sounding the same..However, KT is all the great folk/rock/blues/country singers you know rolled into one.. Her voice has passion, depth, and great emotionality... The music is natural, and from the heart combining Rikki Lee Jones/ Maria Muldaur/Carole King/Wynonna and a host of others into one fantastic style.I bought the album for Black Horse and the Cherry Tree but fell in love with the rest of it.. I especially like vocals on ""Heal Over""I expect much more from this bright young artist.. and hail her as the savior of modern music. Finally, someone who is not the same old ""Brittney, Gwen, Christina"" Pop star with the same old sound... Brava!!!!! Run don't want to get this album.. she is amazing!!"
2,Truly Disappointed,"I like KT Tunstall don't get me wrong. But the producer of thisCD did her a great injustice. I first heard KT on NPR in a radio interview. Her voice was raw and filled with energy- quite unique. If you have a chance to see her in concert and you appreciate singers whose voices can stand alone you will truly enjoy her. It is unfortunate for her that whoever produced this CD did not think her voice could stand on its own. Clearly, over synthesized music sells better in these modern times. To have a musician that does not need their voice manipulated and smoothed over is rare- and that is KT. But this CD is in one word...Overdone- and perfect for the background of commercials and your favorite Desperate Housewives episodes...Save the money you would spend on this CD and see her in concert....KT if you read this - get someone who is not afraid of your talent to produce your next album."
5,All eyes to the Telescope because this one's a star!,"This is an excellent debut by an exceptionally talented and promising artist. I'm being honest when I write that every track is a standout: refreshing and sassy. My personal favourites include 'Suddenly I See', 'Other Side of the World' and 'Black Horse and the Cherry Tree' but the entire album is great. At first I couldn't put my finger on what I liked so much about this album but after listening to it for the about the third time I realised that she sounds very similar in style to Jeff Buckley (with maybe a hint of Macy Gray): her voice exudes that coolness, sexuality and intimacy that comes with great confidence in one's ability. I'm not saying that she's an instant legend but if you do listen to this album you will hear something different from the norm and definite evidence of greatness in the making. Excellent music with fantastic songwriting that's cool and emotional. Brilliant!"
5,The Best Album EVER,"I fell in LOVE with KT Tunstall's Eye to the Telescope! It's soulful, it's bluesy, it's intelligent!"
2,...A little too poppy,"I heard her on NPR and immediately ordered this album. She sounded a little less polished and a bit bluesier when playing live on the radio. The addition of studio musicians and the inevitable polishing of her sound in the studio have dulled the sound I was attracted to.This first album is a bit too poppy for my tastes, but I would look forward to a live solo album."
2,okay but not great,There are 3 songs on here that are any good. The rest of the album is just so so. Too bad because she has a good voice. I had hoped for more and was disappointed.
4,Easy to listen to...,"I first heard KT Tunstall on a PBS TV program. I liked what I heard and ordered her CD. I was not disappointed. Not that every song is a winner, but most are quite good...interesting lyrics and a voice that is very easy on the ears."
3,Is this all there is??,"I decided to purchase this record after hearing Black Horse and the Cherry Tree and Suddenly I See. I was so disappointed that the album did not quite jive with those two songs. You need to know that there are only two upbeat songs on the album and you've already heard them on the radio. You also need to know that the rest of the album is country/folk/rock - moody and not a little lethargic. That's not to say that the album is bad, just not what I was expecting. And I'm glad I bought it - having those two hits in my library is good enough. KT is a good singer, decent lyricist, and the songs have a nice mellow flow, but aside from the up tempo numbers, you've heard all this before. Highly recommended for two great songs, but the album as a whole is a bust."
3,Mostly forgettable with two jazzy numbers,"I admit it: I bought this album for ""Black Horse and the Cherry Tree."" Most of the album is kind of generic forgettable modern country-rock. Only ""Now I See"" rocks enough to make me want to listen again. I hope that Ms Tunstall does more in the style of those two songs on future albums."
4,A DOUBLE GEM VIDEO,"This 1931 Renoir movie, made four years after the arrival of the first talking picture, is a very realistic analysis of some aspects of Montmartre way of living, with it's crude dialogue, lightened only by Renoir's naturalistic poetry. Michel Simon gives in this film (and in ""L'Atalante"") one of his top performances as the constantly humiliated husband who goes painting to support his mistress who exploits him.""La Chienne"" comes with the 1936 short ""Une partie de campagne"" , a masterpiece of French freshness which reminds us that Jean Renoir is also the son of the impressionist painter Auguste Renoir.One complaint about this bonus film: dialogue is almost inaudible due to sound parasites."
5,FRIO cooler packs work!,"I've been using a FRIO cooler pack for insulin for 7 or 8 years with very happy results. Insulin doesn't need to be refrigerator-cold, it only needs to stay below 80 degrees F to be safe. The three secrets are 1) make sure it's well-soaked and holding plenty of water, 2) make sure it has moving air to ""breathe"" because evaporation is what cools, and 3) keep it out of direct sunlight because that will heat the bag, which heats the water, which heats the contents. My first pack lasted all these years of daily use, it's time for another only because the fabric is soiled. I'm a lifetime customer."
3,Not Great,"I have owned the frio wallet for about a year now. I do not feel that it keeps the insulin cool enough. I put it straight from the fridge into the prepared frio wallet and when I remove it about 2-3 hours later, the insulin vial feels just a few degrees above room temperature. I was under the impression that it keeps it at the temp that it was when it went into the wallet but this is definitely not the case. It's a shame because it is a good idea in theory but I just don't feel comfortable using it for extended periods of time. Furthermore when the wallet is expanded after being in the water it is extremely difficult to stuff the insulin vial into it and even more difficult to get it out. I read that Frio advises to wait for the wallet to start evaporating...who has time for that when you need to leave the house at that moment??"
1,Consume this Stuff with Extreme Caution,"This is a very tasty tea, but you should be very careful if you are pregnant. I decided to check the ingredients before drinking it. As it turns out, there is some debate regarding the very first ingredient, raspberry leaf. It is unclear whether this is safe early in a pregnancy, or whether it should only be used at the end...when trying to induce labor. Rather than take any chances, I threw the stuff out!I think the manufacturer should warn people not to consume this during early pregnancy, or at least advise of the risks. The advertising is irresponsible, in my view. No more Yogi products for me."
5,i love this tea!,"I am not a water person but really need to get enough water intake during my pregnancy. I need a little flavor or something to my water and this is perfect! I bought this tea from Whole Foods and really liked it so when I saw this 6 pack for a major discount compared to their price, I had to get it!"
2,2 months of use and scratched beyond use,"My husband bought this (just the 10 inch saute pan) specifically because the non-stick coating is supposedly safe for metal utensil use. I rarely use metal utensils, but I don't like having to worry about using the wrong ones. I have used this pan several times a week for the past 3 months, occasionally using a metal spatula, or metal tongs to remove objects from it. After using metal tongs to remove something this week, I noticed during washing that the coating is scratched to the point that I don't want to cook with it, for fear of getting chemicals in my food. I have consulted Tefal's website, and although they claim it won't scratch, scratches to the non-stick coating are not covered by the (limited, lifetime) warranty.I like the heft of the pan and the grip, but there's no way I'm dropping $50 for another one"
3,Love and Hate,"This T Fal set was beautiful when it arrived. It was well-made, solid and heavy. Size was perfect for what I wanted and very thoughtful selection of pots and pans. It deserved Jamie's approval.Then I started to use it. Sadly, scratches started developing in the pot and pans. Now, it is in sad shape. Things stick a lot. I still use it but scratches in the pot and sticking pan really makes it hard to use.It is a bit sad that clearly thought out set of finely crafted pots and pans has serious flaw of pots scratching too easy and pans sticking.I am so upset at T Fal for messing this up. It seems to be obviously their fault in selecting bad non-stick scratch proof coating. It is a shame to shame Jamie like that. I am offended."
5,Jamie is the best!,jamie oliver has done it again.... but i have to tell you.... you have to be dumb to think that you can use metel on non stick.... and on metel you have to use lower heat so it deos not burn. jamie has done it again
1,"No longer organic, runs easy, stings sensitive eyes","I purchased this because I wanted to switch to all-organic make-up and hygiene products. This one is no longer able to be certified ""organic"" because the producers are now in China.Additionally, it doesn't go on very well and it runs VERY easily. (I mean, if your eyes barely water even from sneezing, you're going to lose your liner.) Even when your eyes are not watering, by the end of the day you're left with raccoon eyes.And even though it's supposedly organic, the product stings my eyes very badly.I switched to Gabriel and I really like it."
1,Made in China,I too just purchased this item and unfortunately did not read the reviews prior. The pencil is marked made in China. The only other writing on the pencil is HONEYBEE GARDENS Belgian Chocolate. It came wrapped in plastic wrap with no other insert or information.
4,Ironic,"Only relatively recently has gender emerged as a cause of health inequity. By contrast, for over a century, it has been recognised that the wealthy have access to better health care than the poor. In developed countries, universal health care lessens this inequity. But developing countries still have this burden, plus a newly recognised inequity due to gender.This book explains the latter. Both in developed and developing countries. The authors found that there are measurable differences in healthcare. The starkest differences are in poor countries, or the poor sections of developed countries. They also raise concern that structural macroeconomic reforms in a poor country, perhaps (often?) to better service its foreign debt, might have the unforeseen impact of worsening healthcare amongst its women. If so, it would be grimly ironic, because these reforms are often aimed at ultimately helping that nation."
5,Morris' Cup of Coffee,"The story of Jim Morris, who made his major league debut at age 35 in 1999. The book covers his entire life, from his childhood obsession with balls of any sort, to the end of his 2000 season. If you've seen The Rookie, then a lot of the later part of the book will be familiar, but you will also discover Morris' road to the majors had a lot more potholes in it than were evident in Disney's kinder-and-gentler portrayal. A much more complete portrait of the man, the book is the perfect to the film. A must read for any baseball fan with an appreciation of the history of the sport."
2,"Movie does not reflect book, vice versa","If you are looking for the book to be the Disney version of the Move, ""The Rookie"", do not get this book. The book was OK, but did not portray the same feeling of ""faded dreams get second chance"" Disney feel that the movie did."
1,Honey isn't well. Cheap junk.,DON'T !!! I'm sixty four years old and have installed a lot of thermostats. This one is such a piece of junk that I almost threw it away. The screws that hold the wires are so small that I had to use a jeweler's screw driver. They aren't strong enough to hold the wires. There are are these small non tapered screws that hold the circuitry on that are a fingernail longer that the recessed holes they go in which keep falling out and disappearing. A real frustration piece. This is not the Honeywell brand that I grew up with. This one and my last one were cheap crap. I will change brands next time.
5,Excellent Compelation of Jefferson's Educational Ideas,This little volume is truly a treasure. Anyone interested in the educational proposals and thoughts of Thomas Jefferson should pick this book. From the beginning Jefferson's career to the end of his life culminating in the creation of the University of Virginia this book show Jefferson's lifelong interest in emancipating the human mind from tyranny. A great book.
2,Poor ink flow,"Like another reviewer I found these hard to ""activate"" to get the pigment flowing. A disappointment for me, I'm afraid."
4,Sharpie Ultra Fine Markers,"I bought these for my hobby - woodcarving. Great for details. They all worked upon receipt.(if you ever have one that doesn't write, tape a 36"" piece of twine on the open cover end, and twirl it around for about 15 seconds. Usually that gets ink flowing again.) There are 24 markers in the set. Sharpie says they make 32 colors of ultra- fine, but I can't get an answer from them as to what colors the other eight are. Can anyone help me? These are great!!The Sharpie pen line is half as wide as the Bic 36 piece ""fine point'."
4,Love Them!,"These are ultra fine point Sharpie markers, that come in a pack of 24. They have intense color and are well suited for detailed drawing. They are perfect for writing on your body because they don’t smear. If you are drawing and you drag your hand across the paper, the ink doesn't get on your hand. They glide effortlessly across the paper. If I leave the cap off for more than a short time, they dry out. The smell is too strong for me. When I have get them on my clothes, they do not wash out. They bleed through paper easily. These makers are good for body art and people who like to draw, but I would not recommend them for young children. I really like these markers and would buy them again."
4,What a good deal!,"I would recommend this product very highly, great colors, large enough set to keep everyone happy and overall a good value for the money."
3,Not Quite So Fine,"Sharpie makes great products but the ""Ultra Fine Point"" seems to be too fine for the ink to flow through at a decent rate. Unless you must have such a thin stream of ink, I'd recommend the Sharpie ""Extra Fine Point"" which does not seem to have this problem."
4,"good, but...","Bought a more recent version of this product at the store today. They've come out with some new colors, including ones they call ""cafe colors."" The new colors are interesting but the pen caps don't really correspond to the actual color. Oh well. And like someone else said, the pastels are so light, it's not worth trying to write with them. You'd have to use them for drawing or highlighting a drawing, maybe. Anyway, I love Sharpies because the ink is permanent and I can do paint washes over them and my favorite is always the ultra fine tips."
2,Sharpie can do better than this!,"I love Sharpie Ultra-Fiine Point as to how well they work BUT warning! The color of the caps DO NOT MATCH THE COLOR OF THE PENS at all other than the red, black & gray! Very frustrating when doing art work with them!! The name of the colors are not even on the pens! Come on Sharpie, as much as we pay for this product you could at least if not match the lids to the actual colors, put the name of the colors on the pens! How do you expect us to do our work effectively? I finally made my own color chart, gave the colors names, then took white ashesive tape wrote my color name and put on the pen. (If you try to use the black marker and write it on the pen it will of course soon wipe off as permanent does not stay on this type of plastic). Took awhile but much needed thing to do."
5,Sharpie Ultra Fine Point,"This was a Christmas gift for my daughter, who is very artistic. She really, really likes them. I would recommend them"
2,Bad,"Already had problems delivering it on time and then the markets about 6 of them dont even work, the are dried out...I dont know how. but its just sad, I have no car and I work 5days a week 24 hours, and so I would like to order things on here more often then I do!"
4,As permanent markers go...,"These were pretty good. You should know that most of the colors are really, really light. Some of them seemed dry, but that is probably just because they are so light."
2,really disappointed,"I love the fit and they do help, but I bought these and every one in the first box started to fall apart. The thread where it is sewn together is unraveling. I opened the second box but didn't check them out yet. Would have been nice if the buyer would have contacted me after I wrote to them. Great that Amazon is trying to work with me."
3,Too filmsy for its purpose. Disappointing!,"Sadly, material is kinda filmsy for its purpose of arthritic/swollen joint compression. Grip/compression is minimal & the product barely provides any kind of pain relief.Another gripe I have is that only 4 out of 10 pcs fit, since the rest are too huge!! Bought 2 boxes cz of this. The remaining 6 x 2 pcs will probably be left to rot away.Will not buy again."
1,Horrid quality,"These are possibly the cheapest and most poorly made product I have ever had the misfortune to buy. I have tendinitis/arthritis in my pinky finger, and the compression gloves are nice, but I wanted something just for the finger. I bought these expecting a little better quality. They immediately ""ran"" when first pulling them on. After about 4 wearings, the sewing along the seam started coming undone. I have worn the one about 6 times and it has run, much like stockings, barely has any elasticity left to it and is coming apart and leaving fuzzy lint everywhere. They aren't that expensive, but considering I have a multi-pack with only a few small enough for my pinky, it is rather disappointing.I would not recommend these. Not worth the time or money invested."
2,shoddy workmanship,I was initially pleased with the product until I tried to use it....the sewn seam began to unravel within 1 hour of use. The second sleeve is beginning to do the same thing....I do not feel they are worth the money paid for the product.
1,Terrible!!,These finger sleeves are terrible. They do not hold up well at all. I got them for an arthritic finger and wore it to work one day(Letter Carrier). The fabric lost its elasticity after about 3 hrs work and the stitching came loose on both ends.
1,Not worth the money,"The ""assorted"" sizes included 2 skinny sleeves which wouldn't fit on my pinky and I have very thin fingers. 2 sleeves which I managed to get on to my swollen index finger; and 8!!!! large sleeves which are useless to me. The 2 sleeves which I managed to use are stretched out after only 3 uses."
3,They are good & Bad,They really help while they stay together..but soon after I started to wear them they ALL start to unravel. I've had to stitch them up to keep them working.
3,Great product until the seam starts to shred.,These are great support for aching fingers but you really need to knot both ends of the seams so they don't unravel. I'm handy with a needle so I fixed them but this shouldn't happen within a week of wearing them. They would be a five if not for the quality issue.
3,finger sleeves,"Most of the sleeves are entirely too small. I do not have large hands, I cannot imagine that most people can use most of them. I can only use the two largest sizes. They do help my trigger finger, but I have to throw most of them away."
3,The Finger Sleeves work well however...........................,"The Finger Sleeves work well in reducing swelling and pain HOWEVER, this particular brand splits open on the ends and comes apart after a couple hours of wear. Be prepared to stitch these sleeves up or return them. If you can find these in your drug store, they cost less and are made by another company and hold up better."
3,"No Dogg Food, but pretty good","If you are looking for an album as good as Dogg Food, as I was, this follow-up isn't it. Don't get me wrong, half of the songs are very good. But, Daz and Kurupt coulda left the other half of the songs off and still had a decent album. I was also extremely disappointed with the lack of any Dre production. Although, I really can't complain as its just really nice to hear Daz and Kurupt flow back and forth again on the same album for more than one song. The one thing that hasn't changed are the lyrics, Daz and Kurupt still can rhyme with the best of em. The standout tracks IMO: Dipp Wit Me, We Livin Gangsta Like, Coastin, We About To Get F Up, At NIght, Sht Happens, Here We Are, I'ma Gangsta, How Many, C-Walkin Cha Cha Cha..."
3,what happened to dpg?,"i have to admit, when i found out that the dpg released a new album, i headed for the record store and picked it up. after two rotations, i have to say that it is sure a step in a different direction. if anyone is wanting the slick production that dr dre added to the dogg food cd, you are in for a dissapointment. daz is quite an accomplished producer, but unfortunately, there is little to no new territory explored on this album. the beats tend to be the same tired west coast bump that everyone has become accustomed to. the lyrics are not all bad, in some tracks, daz seems to almost outshine his more tallented partner. although this cd isn't the classic that dogg food was, it is a solid effort. it is a step in the right direction after the poor release of kurruption for kurrupt (streetz iz a mutha was respectable) and after r.a.w. by daz which was seemed more of an effort to show that he could put out an album without the help of death row."
4,This IS the best west coast album for 2001,"If you like west coast gangsta s*$t, then this is a must have. ""We about to get fucc up,"" is the best track on this album if not the best west coast track for 2001. ""Dip wit me"" is the 2nd best track, ""coastin"" is cool too. definitely check this album out............"
4,Dillinger and Young Gotti,"This album is tight. A couple of the tracks are definately for the 'GaySideGanstas' but 95% of this album is the the sort of tunes you expect from the best RAP double act ever. 'At Night'..'Get Stripping'.....'Dilli Solo and Gotti Solo' are tracks equal to anything they have ever come up with. If you liked Dog Food, RAW, Revenge..... you will love this.A must for any Dogg Pound lover!!!!"
1,James Dean beginning,"This is possibly the worst movie I have ever seen. Being a James Dean fanatic, I naturally had to own the first movie that names him in the credits. The cover of my copy (Dean in a army helmet) is deceiving, because the movie is really a story about the death of Jesus. Dean is the apostle John, and has about 2 lines. If i could give this movie zero stars, I would."
5,Interesting piece from another era,"I give this a high rating as I found it a curious little piece, that is definitely dated, but valid within the context of the time it was made. The concept is the story of Easter as told by a chaplain to a bunch of war-weary youths on the front lines, with scenes of the Easter story inserted between the battlefront scenes at beginning and end. Yes, it's hokey at times, but that's how they used to make spiritual movies back then. Although, the airs and phony low voice that James Dean affects are almost laughable, he only has a few lines, and he's somewhat in the background for the most part. Costumes and sets are a bit corny and stereotypical as well. But through the negatives, a nice little spiritual period piece from another time in Hollywood shines through. As a item of memorabelia for James Dean collectors, it's worth the purchase to see one of his very early roles."
2,Lovely Boy!,"I bought this for the sole reason that James Dean performs in it. This is quite a religious movie. It's actually about the events that took place directly after the crusifiction of Jesus. Everybody's boring and dramatic... just not... at all interesting. James doesn't have that big of a role, nor that many lines. I suppose this is one for the religious and the collectors. It's not for those who are craving a famed passionate Dean performance."
2,short lived joy,"This was the first humidifyer I ever bought. I've since moved on to other models.On the plus side, this model is extremely small and a full tank lasts through an 8-hour night and makes a discernable difference in a small bedroom. You can hear the fan, it is not totally quiet, but it was something I could live with. Very easy to clean!The white dust the unit sprays its surroundings with was the main reason for me to not buy another one file a warranty claim once the fan started failing after a year and the unit became unbearable noisy.I would not recommend this model. There are better ones."
4,Good but somewhat out of date,"I'm using this in a college class, and it's an easy-to-read, interesting book. Everything's broken down and thoroughly explained, and there are some much-needed tips interspersed with the main content. I see two drawbacks with it--one, it's old. I really won't subtract much for that, as it's hard to keep an in-print book on technology updated. I'm subtracting a star because it discusses a lot of things that don't need to be manually done much any more, such as setting up dial-up connections and mounting hard drives. Most of that is done for you in a modern Linux/Unix OS. It's not useless information, because it's possible you could come across it, but I'd prefer some of the seemingly superfluous stuff be in an Appendix.I'm definitely going to be keeping this book around once my class ends; it will be a great reference if I forget something."
4,Awesome for saving bulk meats,"I frequently fish and/or buy meats in bulk and need to freeze them. This stuff really protects from freezer burn and is easy to use. My only complaint is that it only sticks to one side, you can't just wrap it up like traditional saran wrap."
5,Awesome product!,"This wrap is great. I don't know why the stores don't carry it. It seals the food and prevents ice crystals from forming. I use it for bread, meats, vegetables, and broths frozen in cubes. I still put in a plastic bag and but the double protection preserves the food much longer. Minimal freezer burn which you get even with the best freezer bags. A must try!"
1,Beware the sticky residue,"I liked this product before the improvements. Now the ""sticky"" is so sticky, it leaves a residue on my glassware and dinnerware. When I complained to Glad, their response was that I should use cooking oil on the residue then wash with soap and water. If this is a convenience item, why do I have to do so much labor? I'm also concerned about the adhesive contaminating food or drink it comes in contact with. I recommend being ""greener"" and using reusable plastic ware."
5,excellent product!,"Glad Press'n Seal Freezer Wrap is the best product of it's kind. I use it for freezing individually wrapped pieces of meat, fish or chicken when I break up a large package. This wrap will keep the food fresh with absolutely no freezer burn. It also protects bread, fruits or vegetables from freezer burn. Instead of throwing out freezer damaged food, I can utilize every piece of fresh or leftover food that is wrapped. Try it. You'll like it. It's difficult to find in stores so I ordered a case from amazon. Had it in no time! Great service!"
3,Where are the missing pages?,"Very interesting, depressing book. Can't help think about all the women that guy used. To say he got what he deserved is an understatement! Such a sick, manipulative man...Everyone he used, to get ahead, also deserved what they got! Such devotion to this man...and just for money!His eccentricities were amazing & made me want to wash my hands every time I put the book down. BUT....Do I have the only copy of this book where pages 325 to 348 were repeated? Then starting again, on page 373?Pretty dissapointing, with the Author the Publisher or BOTH! Would like to fine pages 349 to page 372!!!!!!!!!! Can anyone help?"
5,Do not miss this one.,Could anybody be more eccentric? Very well writtenbiography. I just couldn't believe it. Wow.
4,The man that made it happen,Enjoyed reading this because the man made such a name for himself around the world woman flocked to him very intriging in his modest Inventions and sadly he turns into a recluse over being hounded by the press no I think it was a drug Addiction but read it for yourself It is especially exciting reading if you believe in Re-incarnation reasons left un_said
3,"Good book, but not a full story of his life","I bought this book and read it cover to cover in a matter of two weeks, it was highly fasinating, but most of the content centered on his depression, and maniacial ways - such as being a recluse in hotels around the world, and his constant desire to have nothing to do with his expanding empire.If your looking for a book that goes deep into the mind and thoughts of Howard Hughes, this is the one, but if you are looking for a book that describes his business dealings, and growing empire, your better off looking somewhere else for this doesnt go into great detail."
3,Howard Reaped what he sowed,"The richest man in America died with NOT ONE friend. Throughout his life, Howard Hughes treated people as objects to be used and tossed aside - women, business associates, everyone. His lifetime habit of looking out for number one and burning every bridge of human contact left him a desperately lonely, sad, angry old man. This book does a good job of chronicling the tragic arc of his life."
5,"Absolute MUST READ, details are amazing and true!","I read this book in August of 2001 while staying at the Beverly Hills Hotel - where much of this book takes place. The details are amazingly true and several of them I personally verified with a few of the old-timers at the hotel who worked there back in the 60's.There is a reference to Hughes staying in Bungalow 4A-B and how the room service waiters had to leave his diner in a tree near the front door, knock and then leave.""I went to Bungalow 4 and the tree near the front door has marks on it between the branches where the diner trays were placed"".One warning about this book. Reading it will change any ideas you had of Hughes being a hero, he led a sad, depressed life and was surrounded by yes-men who let him destroy himself.Hack's detailed account is the best I have every read about Hughes."
4,Hip-Hop at its finest,"There is no doubt that Saukrates is one of the illest underground emcees out there. It's the return of hip-hop as we know it, straight from Canada!"
1,BEWARE !!! Don't buy this version,"I gave one star to this album, but it's nothing personal with Saukrates. He is a fine underground mc and The underground tapesis a 4 star release... BUT BEWARE , THE U.S.A. RELEASE OF ""THE LOST TAPES"" HAS 6 TRACKS LESS THAN THE CANADIAN VERSION SO ,[...]!!!IT'S A SHAME THAT THE LABELS ARE TRYING TO SELL SOMETHING LIKE THAT !!! THE CANADIAN VERSION IS LIKE BUY THIS VERSION PLUS A FREE 6 SONG EP !! SO REMEMBER: D-O-N-T B-U-Y- T-H-A-T- S-*-I-T"
5,Joint supplements for dogs,"Item was as expected. Very pleased to be able to purchase a large count bottle instead of having to buy every few months. Besides, my dogs likes them."
3,Elephant in the room,"The author of 1 Peter writes in chapter 2 that the governors are appointed by God to punish those who do wrong.In the very same chapter, the author talks about how Jesus suffered and was insulted.The cognitive dissonance to claim that the earthly governors are sent by God to punish those who do wrong and then immediately claim that Jesus was punished must have been huge.How could the author of 1 Peter have believed Jesus was mocked, stripped, whipped, beaten, and crucified by Romans and write what he did in chapter 2 about the governors punishing those who do wrong?Dunn, of course, simply ignores this elephant in the room. If he allowed himself to read the text, and see that these early letters have no knowledge of the Romans crucifying Jesus, then he would have to rethink his entire lifes work.So he just ignores whatever he cannot fit into his paradigm of the Gospels being historical."
1,The worst dance style in history,"For anyone who is interested in wafer thin beats, repetitive basslines which seem like they go on forever, and annoying vocals pick this band up. I feel so embarresed that America think UK garage represents our hip hop scene. I wouldn't have rated them any stars, but I have given them one because they can be hillarious, oh wait....they're not supposed to be.All garage must die, long live IDM and Braindance"
1,BORING!,I wait every year for her books to come out and I can't believe this is what she has to offer us!...I was 20 pages into this one and could sense that this wouldn't be worth continuing. I've never taken so long to read one of her books; it just didn't keep my interest. Out of curiousity I peeked at some of the other customer reviews and they confirmed my exact thoughts - why did I spend money on this? I hope next year's offering is an improvement and gets back to her usual style of fast pace and exciting characters.
4,Very Good,"I just recently discovered Sandra Brown and have enjoyed all of the books that I have read. The Alibi kept my interest throughout, however, at the very end, what exactly happens to Hammond & Alex? Do they stay together? Does he get his promotion? Are they going to be menetioned in another novel?"
1,One of Sandra's worst!,"I love Sandra Brown and because she writes so slowly I expect wonderous things from her. THE ALIBI was by far one of her worst books - I didn't even bother to finish it. It was formulaic, predicatable, and BORING! I love you Sandra - what has happened?!"
2,Not her best work :(,"I am an avid fan of Sandra's and have snatched up everything of hers even from her Erin St. Claire and Loveswept days. The Alibi has too many subplots and forces you to take a while to warm up to the plot. The characters are never fleshed out to the point where you really care about them. And unfortunately, I figured out who done it by page 15 though I wasn't really sure why the killer did it. She also left quite a few of her subplots dangling and cut the book off abruptly. I realize romantic suspense is all the rage but I kind of wish Sandra would write a sizzling, lusty Southern burn-up-the sheets true love story and take a break from the intrigue. As I said, not her best work. Think I'll re-read Slow Heat in Heaven or Fanta C and forget about this one!"
2,Not Sandra-Brown-Caliber,"Surprisingly, this book was very disappointing to say the least. The plot was very choppy and it did not hold my interest. As an avid Sandra Brown fan who has always enjoyed her novels, I found her style of writing in this book to be very eclectic. I enjoy and appreciate her old and new styles of writing, but this was definitely not Sandra Brown caliber."
4,Very fast paced. It kept you wondering who did it.,"It's amazing how all of the people tied to each other by circumstances in one way or another, and all of them had something to hide. I switched my opinion of who murdered Lute Pettijohn several times as circumstances unfolded. It was a very nice surprise ending. You never would have suspected the person who did commit the murder."
2,"slow paced, easy to lose interest",I have read most of Sandra Brown's book and I agree that this is not one of her most exciting books. I found it too slow paced and too caught up in mundane details. Half way through I started skimming until the end.
4,Super Character Inter-twining,This character knows this one. This one slept with that one. This one... You get the idea. I enjoyed the twists and turns.
1,"Brown's worst, complete garbage.","I can't believe Sandra Brown actually wrote this tedious, predictable book. It has none of her trademark plotting or enjoyably sleazy characters. Everyone in the book is one-dimensional and the killer is so obvious it's laughable. The story centers on a local prosecutor who sleeps with a woman he meets at a county fair and when the woman turns up as a murder suspect, he's too wimpy to come forward as her alibi until he's proven she's innocent. Even Brown's usual hot love scenes are dull, and, even worse, told in flashback! A waste of time and money. I think I'll reread ""The Witness"" or ""Exclusive"" to erase all memory of this book!"
5,First Rate Fiction,"The third novel by Sandra Brown shows that she ""has the goods"" to excite her loyal fans. A mixture of corruption, romance and deadly intent in the South Carolina setting, The Alibi captivates the reader from first to last.A good read for a fine summer day!"
2,too long,"I would give this book 2.5 stars(why doesn't amazon offer the option of 1/2 star?)At the end of this book, it became more fast paced. But she could definitely have cut out a good 100 pages or more and it wouldn't have ruin the story. I decided to skim through page 250-400 or so, just reading the dialogue. I'm finding some of Sandra Brown's books to be long winded, while others are really good and the perfect length. Total hit or miss. Nothing out of the ordinary, this is just a typical murder mystery,other reviewers can go over the plot for you."
2,So boring I could hardly wait to get it done!!!,"In all of my years of reading Sandra Brown books, I have never come across one that was below four-stars until now. ""The Alibi"" was very boring and I found myself skipping paragraphs and hoping the next page would prove fruitful. All I can say is that Sandra Brown should stick to steamy romance novels and do us all a BIG favor!!!!"
4,Welcome back Sandra Brown. . .,"After reading Unspeakable(which was unreadable), I was afraid to read this one although I am a long time fan of Mrs. Brown. But she is back in her old form. I have not finished the book yet, but I can't put it down. Welcome back Sandra!!!"
2,It is just OK,"I love Sandra Brown. This book is not like her other books ,It is boring and long .It is not like her to write a book like this.I hope her next book will be great.I still love her ."
5,EXCELLENT BOOK - COULD NOT PUT IT DOWN UNTIL THE END!,I have read many of Sandra Brown's books and enjoy her books with mystery and romance. This book kept me reading until the end. I would highly recommend this book!
4,Better Than I Had Expected,"After reading many of the negative reviews posted here, I decided to give ""The Alibi"" a try anyway. I'm a great Brown fan and was dismayed at the negative reviews on this book. Pleasantly I was surprised that I did enjoy it more than I thought! A good read! My favorite has got to be ""The Witness"". Now, that's a great book."
1,can't help but not like,"Just when I thought Sandra Brown could do no wrong. I couldn't even finish reading it and with the thanks of one helpful reviewer I felt no need. I really had to force myself to get through as much as I did, and I never not finish reading something. ALL the characters really weren't likable they were all deceiving little liars. A little more than halfway through the book and the story was going nowhere. The girl was most likely using him anyway and they were too wrapped up in each other to do their jobs which was a ridiculous case. Some rich, old jerk murdered. That could be interesting but not enough this time. I love the author but not this book."
3,video review,5th book read in 2012.Number 159 out of 237 on my all time book list.Follow the link below to see my video review:[...]
3,The Alibi,"Hammond Cross is a sexy Assistant DA in Charleston, SC. He is in a very prominent spot, and expected to take over the top office soon. Hammond has had this planned as everything else in his orderly life. One reckless night, he meets Alex Ladd, and his life is changed forever. After an unforgettable night together, she disappears. When Hammond gets back to his normal life, he is distraught to find out Alex is suspected of murdering a local prominent businessman. If he provides Alex an alibi, that would be career suicide, so he sets out to find out who the real murderer is.This was a disappointing story. I had trouble buying the love at first sight forgoing all else between Hammond and Alex. The chemistry wasn't there, and the pairing just didn't work, so that made the rest of the story hard to accept. The buildup was lacking, as if a lot of the important steps took place behind the scene. The big reveal at the end was also a let down because there wasn't one."
4,Murder+mystery+sex,"This is another of Sandra Browns murder mysteries,written in her own unique style, with pacy dialogue, a good plot and some exciting sexy bits thrown in for good measure.One of Charlestons most prominent businessmen, Lute Pettijohn, is found murdered in his hotel suite. Hammond Cross, an ambitious,young Assistant Attorney, is given the case which,if he proves successful in bringing the murderer to justice, would be his final stepping stone to the job of District Attorney.There is no shortage of suspects as Pettigrove was a ruthless and disliked man, but when the main suspect is proved to be a beautiful young phsycologist.Dr Alex Ladd, the story becomes interwoven with leads,red herrings and other people with a real reason for wanting Pettijohn dead.A good,fast and engrossing read."
3,WAKE UP SANDRA BROWN!,"SANDRA BROWN IS BY FAR ONE OF MY FAVORITE ROMANCE WRITERS. SHE HAS REALLY STRAYED FROM THAT STYLE WITH HER LAST SEVERAL BOOKS. WHILE THEY ARE GOOD BOOKS THEY LEAVE US WONDERING WHY SHE HAS CHANGED HER STYLE SO MUCH. THE ALIBI IS A GOOD READ, BUT IF YOU ARE THINKING THAT IT WILL BE LIKE SOME OF HER BOOKS LIKE THE TEXAS SERIES YOU WILL BE DISAPPOINTED. SAVE SOME MONEY AND CHECK IT OUT OR BORROW IT FROM SOMEONE ELSE."
2,Boring,"I am not sure if the reviewers who called this a ""page turner"" ever read one prior to this. The book started off boring and had trouble ever becoming more than mildy interesting. I would recommed less descriptive detail and more character development..maybe just even one likable character. The end was decent but it does not make up for a bore of a book as a whole."
2,Plodding and boring,"I love Sandra Brown and almost all of her books, but this one fell short. Its characters had no depth and it was hard for me to feel any emotion towards any of them, also the plot was boring. The characters were not well-described and I still dont really have a picture of what the DA Hammond Cross (main character) looks like. Actually I dont really know what any of the people look liked because they were barely described. If you want to read really good books by Brown pick up ""Envy"", ""Breath of Scandal"" or ""Best Kept Secrets"" which are only a few of her great ones."
1,Imposter Alert! Please return the Original Sandra Brown!,"Sandra Brown is, in my opinion, one of the best Fiction writers of our time. As the years have progressed her works have only got better. BUT, Alibi was very slow moving, and quite honestly, boring. I found myself asking ""Why did I spend all that time reading this book?"" If you really feel you must read this book, maybe you should just read the blurb; that's as interesting as the book will get."
2,Not as good as mirror Image,"her first big hit, Mirror Image was the type of book that made me become an avid reader of Sandra Brown, but from that book on, she has let me down. I keep waiting for another one as good, but she promises but does not deliver.Exclusive was boring...alot to do about nothing..an extended plot that seems to go nowhere. This book, as well as the last few start off great, but dwindle down to a boring middle, and I usually rush to see where or how it ends. I think she just lost me as an avid reader.."
1,I tried,"I hate it when I try out a #1 bestseller and can't get far enough into it to get interested. I put this book away after about 80 pages. The characters were neither likable nor despicable, they were just shallow and boring. The reviews indicated this was going to be a page turner - did this book come out on the coat tails of something fantastic by Ms. Brown? The spawning romance was unreal and unrealistic, the angst of the main characters (or at least who I assume were going to be main characters) had no discernable cause. Everyone was dark and disturbed, but what about? The mystery to me was going to be how many pages until something interesting happened."
3,Took a while to get into it,"This book was a little slow paced for me. It took me a while to get into it and honestly by the end, I was glad I had made it through. Probably won't go and fetch any more of Sandra Brown's books for a while. This was my first read by this author."
4,entertaining read,"An entertaining read filled with quirky characters, likeable characters and suspicious characters. The author combined a murder mystery with romance, upstanding characters along with scoundrels, and mixed in some second chances. I enjoyed getting to know the two main characters and some of the lesser ones. I received this book as a First Reads Giveaway and I look forward to reading more titles from this author."
3,Not Sandra Brown's best book for sure,"I'd like to give it 2.5 stars. The book is an okay read. One thing that detracted from my enjoyment of the story was that one of the main characters, Hammond Cross, was described as a charming and ethical man. However, his behavior during the interrogations of Alex Ladd was so idiotic and impulsive, let alone his unethical behavior getting involved with the suspect sexually."
1,Boring and Pure Drivel,"Sorry Ms. Brown, This is strike 3 for me. I am not going to pay for anymore hardcovers. I will check out your next book from the library. I know you are not writing ""those"" kind of books anymore, ie. Mirror Image, Slow Heat In Heaven, Texas Trilogy - to name a few. My question is: Why Not? That is where your true talent lies. I know there are millions of your readers who love ""those"" kinds of books and were and are willing to pay the hardback price for the sheer joy of reading a book by a writer with your immense talents. Please reconsider, you have fans who truly miss you. As for The Alibi, I will let my rating speak for itself. One of your first forays into Romance/Mystery was French Silk which was a true keeper. How I long for the old days."
2,A read that's just OK....,"Romance fans, skip this one! In fact skip all Ms. Brown's new books---she's trying to distance herself from us all. Suspense fans, this is an OK read, Hammond Cross is an interesting character. And the mystery, did keep me guessing--for a short time. This is one of those authors, that has dropped off my automatic buy list. This book is worth a trade at the UBS, and that's about it!"
2,Old Sandra vs. New Sandra,"There's definitely an old-Sandra Brown style and a new-Sandra Brown style. Those who liked the old seem to find a lot of fault with these newer ones - that's why the ratings for this book range from 1 to 5 stars! I, who only started reading the new style, think she's quite good! Good romance, suspense, and lots of action! Now, having said all that, I must say that I didn't really enjoy The Alibi. The book I really liked was Exclusive. But this one - I got frustrated about 2/3 of the way through and skipped to the end just to find out who did it.What was the problem? Brown couldn't make Alex and Hammond ""connect"" for me. Tons of physical attraction but otherwise - too many secrets, too many lies, too DRAGGED OUT. Very disappointing."
4,Worth the money,These guys are some talented brothas. Voice ... 10 stars. Lyrics ... 9.5 stars. Music ... 10 stars.
4,COMTEMPORARY GOSPEL WELCOMES TRUE TALENT!!!!!!,"PRAISE & WORSHIP PIONEER RON KENOLY PASSES HIS GIFT OF VOICE TO HIS SONS-THE KENOLY BROTHERS-THESE GIFTED SINGERS SERVE US A NICE PLATE OF R&B SONGS WITH THE MESSAGE OF THE GOSPEL-THE CONCERT-LIKE OPENING SONG ""WE WELCOME YOU"" IS DEFINITELY APPEALING TO THE EARS-ALTHOUGH IT COULD HAVE BEEN LONGER. THE UPTEMPO ""COME WITH ME"" IS A HOLY GHOST PARTY AND SOMETHING EVERY YOUTH SHOULD LISTEN TO.""MY EVERYTHING"" IS ALSO A GEM. BUT THE STANDOUTS ARE THE BALLADS-THE POWERFULLY ANOINTED ""WHY I LOVE YOU(YOU ARE MY JOY) IS A SONG EVERYONE SHOULD HEAR(SAINT OR SINNER).""THE TITLE TRACK ""ALL THE WAY"" IS A AWESOME TESTIMONY AND A TRUE ONE THAT MANY CHRISTIANS EXPERIENCE.THE MID-TEMPO ""IN THE MIDST"" IS MELODIC AND CERTAINLY A GROOVE TO BOP YOUR HEAD TO. THESE TWO YOUNG MEN HAVE MATURE AND POWERFUL VOICES-SET TO STYLISHLY PRODUCED TRACKS-YOU'LL DANCE, YOU'LL SING, YOU'LL CRY TEARS OF JOY- THIS CD SHOULD BE A PART OF ANY TRUE GOSPEL LOVER'S COLLECTION. *HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"
1,Biased,"The editor collected this set of articles in a very biased, one-sided and narrow fashion. No objectivity. The editor has obviously not had any experience dealing with horse situations where ""modern/conventional"" medicine has failed or under FEI competition rules where invasive techniques are illegal.At least Dr. Ramey is consistent with his tenacious view of alternative therapies. I would be more interested if he were to turn the microscope on conventional vet medicine to see which procedures and techniques had the gold seal of the scientific method: double blinded, randomized and controlled. Medicine and the scientific method are both fantastic but there may be others...."
1,Looked forward to a balanced and scientific review BUT,was very disappointed and felt the author did a disservice to balanced critical review and assessment. I did agree with a number of the findings in the books but the author should have provided less personal opinion and adhered to balanced scientific review rather than providing sweeping generalisations of certain therapeutic modalities. Absolutely regret having bought this book.
1,Consumerr's Guide to Alternative Therapies in the Horse,"Very Disappointing. The Author sets out ""open mindedly"" to investigate numerous alternative therapies for horses and proceeds to discredit each and every one of the therapies, concluding that the horse owner should revert to consulting the Veterinarian. A desperate attempt to preserve the Veterinary Profession."
1,Toilet Paper Is A Better Buy,"Junk. The author wants a 'good 'ol boy' pat on the back from other veterinarians. ""Atta boy, Davey, you tell 'em! Tell 'em all what quacks those alternative practitioners are. Atta boy! Sick 'em boy. Atta boy!"" Oh why oh why doesn't Amazon allow for zero starts. Or even negative stars? The author does not know the first thing about alternative health care for man nor beast. Just a bias, non-open minded view. How do I know? Because he published the same kind of non-researched tripe about me. In one essay he lied about me at least three times. He probably thought I wouldn't see it. Don't believe ANYTHING this author writes. Go online and just read articles for free. This book is pure swill."
1,Author bias against Alternative Therapies,"Given the interest of many regarding alternative and complementary therapies, I think it should be mentioned that while the author does have some good points, he does not believe that these modalities should be taught in veterinary school, nor does he ever advocate their use in any journal article he has written. All of his articles ridicule the use of these therapies. It is as if he has a mission to keep alternative and complementary therapies from being used among veterinarians. Yes, he does have some good points about lack of trials for evidence. But there are many articles written and published about this growing field, and there are plenty, plenty, plenty of medical practices we take for granted that have never been tested with clinical trials. So take from it what you will, but know that he has not published any article with a positive light on this subject."
5,Great book,I really enjoyed reading this book. The author captured the life of the great Coco Chanel in a very interesting detail. I recommend this book to all fashion lovers
2,Disappointed,This book wasn't what I was expecting. Lots of pictures and not enough history. I love fashion (not the crap they 'design' today) so yes I want to see pictures especially when it's Chanel. But I bought the book to get the total history of the designer and have found myself wanting. It just didn't feel like much at all on Chanel as a person.
2,Chanel and Her World,"I was disappointed in the text. I guess from the title I should have expected some world history. The story line is somewhat incoherent and doesn't seem to present her life very well. I had to use the index to find a couple lines of reference to her ""Boy"", a romance started in the story and then dropped, only to be finished much later and with no real detail. Either Chanel was very closed mouth about a lot of her life or the author didn't know her that well. Also, there are a lot of pictures of rather irrelevant items. I wouldn't purchase it again."
4,"the rise, fall and rise of one woman","Not only beautifully written, it gives you a perfect picture of a fascinating era and a fascinating woman. In a way Chanel lived ahead of her time, on the other hand she had a perfect sense how to translate that into the time she was living. I thoroughly enjoyed the book."
4,Great Product!!!,Loved it. It's cut very well and smooth. I would definitely buy it again once I need another replace. I would definitely recommend on buying it.
5,Yummy as always!,These were a Birthday gift for my mother! She loves chocolate! Perfect gift for her!I have never had an unhappy camper with these chocolates and they are my favorite as well!
2,Had two bad batches.,"Knowing I'd save a lot of money buying these chocolates online, I instantly went to Amazon to see if they sold it.The first time I ordered Rochers from Amazon, it was during summer. When they arrived, the Rochers were all melted with chocolate dropping out of the foil wrappers. After throwing them in the freezer for a day to let them harden, the foil had been mixed into the chocolate..I either had to break off all the hazelnut chocolate, or eat the Rocher with bits of foil in it.The second time I purchased them for Valentine's Day. The package looked fine..but when I bit into the first one, it was very stale tasting. The inside fudge was crumbling apart, and the wafer was real flexible, like what happens to an ice cream cone after a few minutes of dripping ice cream has been absorbed into it.Even if the price is cheaper online, these two bad experiences have made me stay away from buying any food product online."
3,YuYu hakusho,"this dvd is so cool i know because i read the summaryies at this website called pojo.com and they have almost evey episode,item used and technique used on the show. It is also a cool place to by packs and other stuff for cheap prices plus yuyu hakusho shirts."
1,Don't do it!,"I bought one (yellow cord) from an online retailer. I'm not kidding, I used it less then 10 times and the cord would not go back in. There is a metal 6 sided spindle on one side that the spring connects to and the other half of it fits in a plastic socket molded into the side cover. The plastic socket shattered.It was virtually brand new. I am not abusive to my tools."
1,P 'o S,"If I could give an item zero stars I'd do it. I've written over 50 amazon reviews and have never given something less than 2 stars...until now. I've owned for less than 2 years and from the moment I bought it, plugs would not fit tightly in the outlets. Most of the time you would have to angle the plugs downward to get contact, otherwise you wouldn't get power. The cord itself is hard to latch and reel in.Today was the last straw. Right when I plugged in my table saw, the thing caught fire and nearly set my hand on fire.DON'T DO IT."
2,Decent Independent Film Rent it instead of Buying,"The Operator is a decent B-movie quality film. The film walks the tightrope between erotic thriller, and comedy, never quite coming together or deciding which way it may go. The Operator played by Jacqueline Kim, is little more than a mysterious voice spouting fake Asian philosophy who tortues the leading man, always just out of his reach. Michael Laurence turns in a lack lustor performance as the philandering, gambling lawyer who lands himself into a peck of trouble. Decent film to rent if you are bored on Friday and Saturday night and want something or someone to laugh at. Don't waste your money, rent it instead."
4,It's good but not sanctioned by Tom...,"The famed ""gravel voice"" is not on these recordings, if you're a fan of the ""Closing Time"" and ""Heart of Saturday Night"" era, you'll love it. I don't think the ""Rain Dogs"" or ""Mule Variation"" fans (or even the ones who like the ""Small Change"" era material) will like it as much, but they'll be curious to at least hear it once. Most of the songs on vol. 1 and 2 are demos from that period. A lot of Dylan, country and folk influences are here more than they would be on later recordings, all the songs stripped down to the basics, probably the way he was performing the songs around that time.They do sound like polished demos although it also gives it an ""honest"" sound to it as well.This is essential for completists who already have everything by him including ""Tales From the Underground"" (kept within the fan circles) although keep in mind that he fought not to have this released. It is good though...."
3,Good overall movie,"With the last few straight to DVD/video films by Wesley Snipes being a little disappointing, I didn't come to expect much from this one but made the purchase because I am a big fan of his movies. Overall, this film is better than the previous two films of his. The actors/actress actually put forth some effort in this film and made their parts interesting. The best part was the fight scene toward the end. There was a little suspense involved in this film as well. I look forward to seeing more of Wesley's movies."
1,Haven't I Seen This Film Before?,"Suggestion. Instead of buying or renting 'The Detonator' from '06 why not watch Wesley's earlier '00 film 'The Art of War' instead. Why you ask? Why because it's virtually the same movie that's why. Oh there are a few differences, Wesley Snipes is now a C.I.A. agent instead of a U.N. agent, he's in Poland instead of New York and the beautiful woman he's protecting this time is Russian instead of Chinese. Other than that it's EXACTLY THE SAME! 'Detonator' Director Po-Chih Leong even had the nerve to copy the supposedly surprise ending used by Christian Duguay in 'The Art of War.'Positives: Silvia Colloca adds some feminine charm to an otherwise dreary film and Matthew Leitch is excellent as tough guy Dimitri.'The Art of War' is a very good movie, 'The Detonator' isn't. Trust me on this one."
4,THE DETONATOR,"It is good enough to have been in theaters not just shot right to disc. Plenty of action, plus Wesley does know how to act. Good plot line, other fine actors doing a good job of it, but you can tell the movie wasn't high budgeted. All in all worthy of consideration in buying."
4,The story thickens...,"The second installment of the Vandread series continues to add to the storyline. The history of Meia is revealed. The relationship between Dita and Hibiki comes to a head, as Hibiki is overwhelmed by the attention. Jura shows her vain and jealous sides as she sets a plot in motion to allow her to ""combine"" with Hibiki's Van-type. The crew begins to show its ""colors"" making them more real, genuine.Though there is action and comedy in the episodes of this volume, the main thrust seems to be character development. It really made the story more compelling for me."
4,Nice mask for the price!,"I purchased this mask to go abalone diving in Fort Bragg, CA. I have only tested it in a pool so far, but found it fit well. It felt really big on my face (I'm an woman with an average sized, heart-shape face), but I didn't have any leakage issues so I'm happy with it. It has a really wide area that touches the face, which I believe contributes to the lack of leakage. It does provide good visibility, but the side panels take some getting used to. They tend to split the picture at the seam and create a little distortion of the side view. I didn't find it to be too distracting. Overall it seems to be a good mask."
1,THE WORST book light I've used,"This one is a stinker! IT doesn't light the entire page, so you have to keep moving the light from the top of the page to the bottom. This was when reading a small paperback. It would be worse with a large hardcover book! It also doesn't stay put on the book. It uses 3 little cell batteries. The battery cover disappeared right away after I bought it (poor design...I didn't take it off...it popped off and I didn't noticed till it was too late to find it!) The battery didn't last long. The design is kind of cute, but the logistics make it not worth the price. Avoid this one! I borrowed my daughter's ""My Light,"" and have been using it for weeks on the same 2 batteries. It also lights the entire page and it has a great little swivel head so you can just point the light where you need it. (from one page to the next). Try that one instead!My Light - LED Task / Reading Clip Light - Green"
2,This CD was okay,"There were only 2 songs that I thought were any good,Radio Activity Rapp and Egypt,Egypt.If you are a fan of 80's rap then this is the CD for you."
2,no muy bueno,"poorly organized and full of mistakes, this is the worst college text book i have ever used. if this is required for your class, buy a used one. the glossary and verb tenses are incomplete and the exercises lack creativity. i used this text for 3 semesters of spanish and it was panned by all 3 of my profs."
3,Pretty but Lacking in Verve.,"Pretty, but lacking in verve. Not as joyous or lovely as other of Verbruggen's recordings. Still highly competent. But even DaVinci, I suppose, had his off days."
3,"Not a fan of the Maslow references, but good book overall.","I liked the book, but not as much as I thought I would. I like the topic, as I think the author definitely is on to something with the trend toward independent consulting and small businesses representing such a large portion of America's enterprise activity. However, I wasn't too impressed by his latching on to Maslow's Heirarchy as his main metphore- given that it's so outdated and lacks any real scientific validity. It was a good book with many good points, but it didn't live up to my expectations."
1,Who is giving these positive reviews?,"It's funny, but I'm almost inclined to think that some of these reviews are written by Dan's friends or family. The book starts off strong with an interesting treatise on the relationship of men and women to the workplace. But after a while, it just reads like a college research paper. Get a library copy before purchasing."
3,Spend Time Elsewhere,"Not a bad book if you have exhausted your list of other business and self-help literature. This book could easily have been reduced by a hundred pages and still made the point that the corporate world of the fifties has been transformed into the free agent world of the 21st century. When Pink focuses on a specific issue the quality of his analysis and the value of the book rises. However, like so many business books of the day it fails to create sustained value and interest. Off to the used rack. (Are there any editors left in the publishing world?)"
1,Waste of Money for Self-Employed Wannabees,"If you just want to learn =about= self-employed people, this is a good book. If you want to learn =how= to become successfully self-employed, save your money. There are too many other books that will be truly helpful, such as Get Clients Now!, The Well-Fed Writer, and InfoGuru Marketing."
5,Enlightening and Motivational,"I found this book inspirational in the sense that before the four-minute mile barrier for running was broken, people felt it couldn't be achieved. However, once the record was broken, others were inspired to strive for their own sub-four-minute records.As Dan Pink presents the stories and lessons in Free Agent Nation which he gleaned from interviews with numerous ""free agents"" I felt my pace quicken in the self-employed race I run daily. It is motivational to run with the knowledge that I'm not running solo but part of a growing number of free agents striving for our own four-minute miles. And the summary of free agent guidelines at the end of the book gave me the confidence that I'm on the right track."
5,reading this book changed my companies business model,"About halfway through this incredible book, Dan had very compellingly convinced me that our companies direction needed to change: we would no longer be serving vast fortune 500 companies, but armies of free agents, microbusinesses and other micropreneurs.This book, in a very impactful, convincing and entertaining way, describes the future of work, and most likely, your future customer. Everyone who does business today should run out, buy this book, read it cover to cover, and re-adjust who they think their customers will be or even are today..."
1,Zero star Previously used and damaged merchandise,"Quality appears OK. After final assembly and then installation of the net, the net was found to have been previously repaired in six places. Somewhat of a disappointing birthday gift.Not sure how my comment once merited 3 stars, but I do not recommend this product nor this company. I would have returned the product had the kit been assembled reasonably soon after gifted and if I had been promptly appraised of its damage.To knowingly send a previously used and damaged product is egregious and merits no star."
5,Be moved to Worship,"Not that we rely on our feelings for faith, but you will feel and be filled with and moved to Worship with this music. Your skin will be raised as well as the spirit within you. I heard this song ""How Great Thou Art"" on the Calvary Satelite Network and was ""moved"".Awesome Worship for our Awesome God. Find it, listen to it, and be moved.His, jace"
3,lund tonneau cover,I think it is a pretty good product but not as good as le bra covers they are easier to remove and recover
3,Good Reference Recording,"This is a decent recording of the music of Persichetti. The ensemble plays well, and they do well handling the very difficult ""Parable"". What is lacking sometimes is an underlying spirit and motion that drives Persichetti's music. Technically these are fine recordings. They play in tune and in time. When performing this music, though, you have to get beyond the technical aspects because there is a tendency for the music to sound sterile and cold if played too technically (except for the wonderful Divertimento). That is what makes his music so great - and so challenging - and why it takes such a skilled group to really perform Persichetti's music. The LSO winds never achieve that level completely. This is a good reference tool, but there are better recordings of the individual pieces out there."
3,A little too much cinnamon,"I love Wellements Bora Bora bars, but this flavor left me cold. I like cinnamon, but the flavor is overpowering, and the texture of the bar made eating it less than pleasurable. Still, this is the only brand of snack bar I buy, because, overall, they are awesome."
2,Disappointed,"I was all excited to get some Hawkins after hearing his amazing voice (and seeing his cameo in Mystery Train). This album looked like a good best-of, but boy is it a stinker. The all-synthesized backing is ear-achingly cheesy and this definitely doesn't sound like Jay at his best. Minus a million points because the only rendition of ""I Put a Spell on You"" is a really stupid ""dance version"" with an extremely dated rap shoved into it."
5,Rutgers University Project on Economics and Children,"Clayton Bates, born into a sharecropping family in South Carolina in the early 1900s, hated farming but loved to dance. Nothing his mother did could stop him from walking into town to the barbershop to tap dance for the customers. She also discouraged Clayton from working in the local cottonseed mill when he was twelve, but Clayton was determined to switch from farm work to factory work.Tragically, he lost his left leg after a terrible accident at the mill, but he did not lose his fierce determination and love of dancing. Clayton ""Peg Leg"" Bates emerged to become one of the country's most famous tap dancers, performing in front of white and black audiences and opening one of the first resorts in New York's Catskill Mountains to welcome African Americans. Knockin' on Wood makes an important contribution to children's literature by raising awareness of this remarkable and talented man."
1,Didn't worked for me,"I snore because of the overweight. Used the product for almost a month. In my case it just didn't worked well. I stoped snoring from time to time but I can't be sure it was because of it. Besides, I lost my Nozovent like 3 times a week while sleeping and after that its really hard to find.I don't recommend it."
1,Beware -- not as pictured,"The product is really good for me - helps prevent snoring and makes it much easier to breathe when I'm in bed. However, beware the seller! The picture above clearly shows two Nozovents in one package, but you only get one. So you do NOT get what the seller has pictured here. (I wrote the seller asking them to send the second one but they refused, offering my money back if I went to the trouble of sending the box back -- but then I would have been out the shipping so it wasn't worth it.) Note that the seller says ""1 Box(s)"" as part of the description -- but the picture shows two Nozovents in one package. Maybe the seller thinks that this makes up for showing a misleading picture of two Nozovents for sale, but I very much disagree -- it's just misleading to picture two items when you're only selling one.So, I strongly recommend Nozovent and would definitely buy this product again, but I'd never buy another product from this seller."
4,Snore aid,Product seems to work well. Spreads inner nose sufficiently to let air easily pass through. Has reduced morning congestion significantly. Can be a bit uncomfortable.
3,Well.....,"This book is good,it teaches you how to draw a horse head,but not a horse.....It teaches you to draw lots of diffrent heads and expressions.When she is done she shades it .But does not teach you how,well she does but it is not step by step.It is like a huge step.[...]Not ANYONE can do it.Then she says to do SCRIBLES to draw a horse body,huh???A very deteiled head with a Scribled Bodythat is not good! I like most of the book ,just that sometimes she jumps big steps,well too big for us!Well go ahead and buy it it is not bad, teachs you lots of things,but a body...."
1,Fish Wouldn't Eat These & Smell Awful!,"I got the dried krill originally because I was trying to train my Sphex Lionfish to eat non-live food. This was something suggested by my normal fish store, as well as my Father whose been keeping salt water tanks for many years. Unfortunately my lion wouldn't go near these with a 10-foot pole and neither would anything else in my tank, including my scavenger hermit crabs. That seemed to be an indication that they wouldn't be useful to me. Plus, they smell AWFUL! Whenever you open the bottle you practically have to air out the room you're in.The bottle has been sitting in a drawer for about a year now and I'm thinking about throwing it away even though it's full."
1,Old,This is anything but fresh - the perfume is old and smelly - probably why there is so much discount??
4,sm. Digital Camera Case,"This camera case is small, leather, and Black, it has a great magnet to hold the case shut. There is a strap to hold and a sm. pocket on the inside that you can fit another chip in if you need extra space. I carry my ID with me and use it as a clutch so I can take pictures while I am out on the town. Great Case!"
1,Not a good recording.,"This recording cannot stand up to Sills' Manon, and on its own terms is not at all good. Angela Gheorghiu is, as usual, off pitch, and Alagna sounds worn out and not at all into the part.If this is the New Age of French Opera, it is a dark age.I have bought this couples' recordings before, and always a major disappointment, except for Alagna, who now has developed his voice way beyond his ex-wife's, and the separation of them should free Alagna up, so that he is not dependent on his very overparted in every part wife.Her Carmen, her Butterfly, this manon, her Il Trovatore (one of the worst recordings of this opera around) etc etc. The Tosca..and on it goes, but the good aprt these recordings have mostly been discontinued."
4,Good book Useful Case Study,"This book is a good introduction into SOAP. The Case Study at the end of the book is very detailed and by following through it, you can gain a solid understanding of SOAP, XML and how to use it.The only drawback is that it doesn't describe in detail the use of SOAP by multiple programming languages. I guess one book can't do all :)"
5,Good WSDL coverage too!,"Pretty much all the titles I have seen do an adequate job explaining why to use SOAP, what it does, and how great the cross platform stuff is. With the current state of interop, I have found that it is necessary to occasionally create custom ""1-off"" WSDL files for parties my company is integrating with. The WSDL chapter pretty much explained what I was looking at and was quite a life-saver.This book will also get you up to speed with understanding all the other stuff too. It just covers WSDL in more that a few pages, which has been very helpful and worth the cost of the book on its own."
1,Save your money!,"Read the previous review to understand the wasteof time and money this book may cause you.It does very little to really describe XML or SOAP in the matterthat is needed. Key elements are skipped or automaticallyassumed, while simple concepts are explained in great detail.uggh!"
2,"I am sorry for the author, he should spend more time on this","It's understandable that the author donot have much time inwriting this book. But I think both the publisher and theauthor should be serious on writing a book.Overall, it's not professional!"
3,"adequate, but construction could be better","Pluses: in size S, these fit my 3 1/2 year old twins adequately (with plenty of room to grow) and aren't covered with licensed characters, which most things in this size range are. They seem to protect the girls ok when they fall. Each piece is labeled as to body part and left or right, which can be handy -- a knee pad looks a lot like an elbow pad! Minuses: in two sets, I've noticed three flaws in assembly/construction. They arrived with the stitches unraveling out of one kneepad strap, the side of one of the channels for the brace in one of the wrist guards is not completely sewn shut, and one of the wrist braces is labeled as a knee pad. None of these is major (though I did have to resew that kneepad strap by hand), but it just isn't excellent manufacturing. I'd probably buy them again, though."
5,Very Happy,We are really pleased with these protective pads. It is one of the only (affordable)sets that we could find that included hand/wrist guards as well.
4,co2 inflator,"when i saw this on amazon i knew i wonted one,i had a friend who had one and it was great for small bike tubes when you were out on the road by your self."
1,"Too hard to use, leaks CO2","This let me down on the trail. I got this so I could use non-threaded CO2 cartridges; however, on a recent trip riding ATV's I had to repair a tire, what a pain to use this unit, you have to push in to get the inflation going and it leaks while doing so. I went through 6 cartridges and could only put appx 1 pount of air in my ATV tire. I'll go back to using the threaded cartridges with old valve setup."
1,What Love Is....,"After watching this movie you many never know what love is. the only good thing about it was Shiri Appleby's and a couple of the other women's part in it.So, skip the first 45 minutes of it and go directly to where the women finally enter the movie for the first time."
1,What A Mistake,"What a mistake it was buying this movie before seeing it first.I'm a big Cuba Gooding Jr. fan so I thought it wouldn't be too bad,boy was I wrong.This movie was so boring.I also Didn't like any of the characters.I didn't care for the plot either.Skip this one!"
5,"Funny, but true","This movie is hilarious. IF you really listen closely to all of the little nuiances, you can get a great deal from the movie. The title and the end of the movie coincide and are absolutely TRUE!! I laughed so hard during the movie, I nearly cried. Funny, insightful, true to the end of What Love Is?"
2,interesting,"Zack is the story of a biracial guy by the name of Zack, For a school project he decide to go to the south to find his black grandfather, who his mother hasen't been in touch with since her marriage of Zach's white Jewish father. When Zach find's his grandfather he realize why he and his mother hasn't been in contact. I felt there was something missing, and that more research should have been done."
4,not bad,"i thought this was a good flick. but if you like carli banks, she is only in the show for about 5 min."
3,Disappointed in the San Francisco Bay Area,"Used to own the vinyl disc then years later I found a three(?) record package of this set featuring ""Diz & the M-R Duo"". I've been waiting for this stellar music to be released on CD and was so happy to finally have some of it until hearing the ""added"" piano pieces sans Diz. I feel The Kepler Label diminished the impact of this CD by including the piano pieces at the expense of so much more music with Diz. Months ago, I wrote to Kepler asking about the future release of the remaining music from this set (for this disc is also labeled ""Vol. 1), and I still haven't heard from them. Hope Kepler straightens up and flies right."
4,Wally at 4 AM,"Great CD, as if he would make a bad album. Captain Marvel is great, as is Dear Georgie. Buy it, download it, borrow it, or steal it from a rich guy."
2,A bit outdated,The information about general hiking and first-aid tips is very useful. Sections on clothing/sleeping bag fabrics is VERY out of date. Too much has changed with fabric technology since this book was written. I agree that post-1995 backpacking books have more accurate information about modern materials.
2,GOOD BOOK FOR GARAGE SALE SHOPPERS!,"This is a perfact book, ya for the sixties or seventies. But it is outdated and old. Stick with the modern books, from 1995, and on. There are some exceptions, like buying 1986 cooking books, or classical fiction books, but every month there are new stoves, backpacks, etc. There is more technology now, then there was, and backpacking books have become more updated. I recommend buying The Backpacker's Handbook, by Chris Townsend, or books by Karen Berger. If you rade garage sales for old gear this might be the perfact book. Otherwise stick with more updated information on how-tos to backpacking!"
5,"Wonderful, unusual carols",I have truly enjoyed listening to this album which contains many carols I have not ever heard before! I will probably select this album as the one I give to friends at Christmas time this year.
5,Fabulous!,"Purchased this item as a Christmas gift for a bird-lover extraordinaire (no kidding), and just from the online description & appearance, this particular heater was better compared to any competitors' choices, even those found in my local area of a large southeastern city with plenty of specialty stores to choose from. It just so happens that this winter season, the southeast has received much more icy, snowy weather than usual, so the bird-lover extraordinaire has been able to really use & test this item. He's loved it so much, that other family members and friends have wanted one!! Needless to say, I'd recommend this item & its seller very highly!"
4,Works pretty good,"Works as advertised, but a little too shallow, hard to keep filled.Could have built one myself with a $10 dollar heater with a rubber made pot pan but the mount would be hard to duplicate."
5,Best I could find!,"While we have this bird bath with the stand and I can't comment onthe mounting issues others have had...this product is fantastic.We have had it for two years (stored in the summer) and have neverhad a problem, today we had 40+ mph winds and it is still standing."
4,Well made and an excellent value,This bird bath has worked out exactly as I expected. The 75W heater has kept the water from freezing through sub-zero (F) temps. The plastic tray is thick and solid (like Tupperware) and holds about a half-gallon of water. The tray lifts out easily when I dump the water nightly. The tray is also easy to clean in the kitchen sink as I had hoped. There is a clip on the tray to hold the electric cord out of the way when not in use.The frame is sturdy and the powdercoating looks good. My only concern is rust stain seeping from the junction where the bracket is welded to the ring. No more than a cosmetic issue at this point (it's been outside for about a month).I recommend this birdbath without hesitation.
2,Cord too short!,"The electrical cord for this birdbath is 8.5 inches long. The instructions say ""Do not use with extension cords."" Now, this is a deck rail mount birdbath--how many people have an electrical outlet within 8.5 inches of a deck railing?"
3,The chipmunks like it.,"I like the product, except that the container for the water does not seat onto the metal rim. It fits like a plastic container that the lid became warped in the dishwasher. You think it is seated, then it pops up. It seems that the heating element works....notice steam on cold mornings."
1,do not buy these batteries,"I bought two of the so called ""new black battery"" on December 2006. They have to be recharged as often as my other 1-year old batteries. I believe that ""new"" may mean ""1- or 2-year new""."
1,Aweful batteries... cheating ... Don't buy (sincear advice),"Please don't buy this battery. It is aweful. It is not new.. and charge won't hold for more than one call for 5 mts.I didn't expect such a expereince from Amazon... Why do amazon let eforcecity to cheat customers.Now I could not send it back, as I have to pay more than the product price itself.This is simply cheating."
1,Poor Quality,"I ordered 2 of these since the price was great. Neither one of the batteries works. The battery I was trying to replace holds a charge longer than these 2 'new' ones. When I tried to contact the seller (eForcity) about replacing the batteries, I did not receive a response."
1,Poor Shipping policy - If USPS lost your order you are out of luck,Seller does not care if your order is lost by USPS. This is shameful and unethical!
1,FAKE!,"There's no such thing as ""The New Black Battery""....counterfeiters are semi-smart enough to not make their products look exactly like the OEM because they know that no matter how hard they try...they'll mess up somewhere - so they just create their own.It would be like trying to fake someone's signature...it's near impossible..it's easier to just sign their name however you'd normally write and just pretend that it's their actual signature - and hope nobody compares the two!"
2,I CAN'T STAND REM AND THIS CD WASN'T ALL THAT,REM IS NOT THE BAND THAT I LISTEN TO. I CAN'T STAND REM AND NEVER HAVE LISTNE TO ANY OR THERE MUSIC. THEY ARE TERRIBLE AND I WILL NEVER CHANGE MY MIND AND LISTEN TO A CD OF THERE'S.
1,NOT the map for a road warrior or traveler,"Trying to navigate across the state with this is impossible. Rather than a standard atlas - where the end of the page helpfully says ""continued on map xx"", this is organized alphabetically by town - and in many cases the map doesn't even hint at where you should look as your road runs off the page. Strangely, although owned by the same parent company - American Maps uses this poorly organized way, while Hagstrom Maps are easy to follow and use."
3,Great Album but BEWARE some songs are not properly digitized and SKIP when playing,"I would give the album 5 stars. It is a great piece of music. However the mp3 version was not correctly digitized and some songs have skips when playing. This is evident if you preview Concierto Aranjuez. Also the name on the listing is incorrect it should be ""Este camino largo"".If it is fixed this review can be withdrawn."
3,promising but disappointing,"I wanted to like this film, I really did but was in the end disappointed. The story was uneven and not well developed in many parts. In some instances, the character Dorian was made out to be the bad guy and the family and friends who crapped on him are portrayed as cool people. For example, there is one scene where Dorian, already in the depths of despair over breaking up with his boyfiend, finds out that his boyfriend is now dating one of his closest friends and he is just supposed to get over it.I particularly detested the character of the father. He was a totally despicable human being and I was frankly glad when he died. I have known more than my fair share of people like that in my life and the world would be a much better place without people like that in it. I also hated that doormat of a mother.I gave this movie 3 stars instead of 2 because I did think the film had potential."
3,Love and support between brothers,"Lea Coco is really the star of this movie, great acting, transmitting lots of love and understanding for his gay brother (Dorian)-Michael McMillian is good too...but Coco is hotter.Is not really a good movie, is just one more, entertaining, easy to see production."
4,Much Better Than I Was Expecting,"This isn't a slick, big-budget production. It can't possibly reach the pedestal of ""high art"" set by Brokeback Mountain or the films of Pedro Almodovar. But as a movie I expected to be just a fluffy, silly low-budget comedy, Dorian Blues managed some surprising about of emotional depth.The largest part of the reason is star Michael McMillian, who manages to never be anything else than appealing even when playing the depths of neuroses. His wide-eyed enthusiam goes a long way towards elevating what could ordinarily be a paint-by-numbers gay indie movie. This is a gem in more ways than one. Highly recommended."
3,A little disappointing but not a bad flick,"Dorian Blues is a coming out story which will probably resonate with a number of gay males who struggled in coming out. I thought this would be more humorous than it was. The cover likens it to Napoleon Dynamite, which in my opinion, it was nothing like (minus an entertaining goofy dance scene which was more embarassing than anything). The acting was good and by ""gay movie"" standards this one was pretty decent. Its a renter though, it was just okay"
3,A Definite Rent,"This title is a fairly good story that has no replay value. The character development takes too long and most of the humor is dark. But, it is also more real to life than most movies of the genre.The basic story follows two brothers from high school to college who are completely opposites...in all aspects of life. It details the affects of an over bearing father figure on the brother's lives and ends with the funeral of the father (or begins as this is one of the first scenes of the movie).Definitely a good movie to rent on a slow night, but I doubt anyone will want to watch it over again."
3,A fabled reality.,"The movie was good and funny, worth a rental not the purchase. It just didn't put ,as other reviewers said, enough good things about gay people ,it said all the bad things but in a realistic way. The thing I hated about the movie was that the gay son always wanted his fathers approval and still talked to him after he was kicked out and disowned, not real. But this movie does provide some real takes on gay people still wanting to come out and how these people want their real life scenarios to end up. I wished that Dorian had found a prince after all the struggling and gloom, he reminded me of myself. The best scene was in the bar when his best friend took his ex and how real they were about not wanting to change as gay people. Overall, I don't think the movie had enough gay parts in it it seemed to be for conservative types."
5,Sparkling gem of a film,"Funny, witty, poignant, romantic, sensitive! A wonderful coming-out film AND rated PG-13, making it easily accessible to ALL age groups!"
3,Some good parts,"Acting was ok, however could have been better. Some of the subject matter was good, like coming out and the awkwardness of being different. The movie also showed the stigma, of being bullied and the insecurity it has to your relationships as an adult."
4,"Something hilarious, something sad ...","To me, Dorian Blues presented a light-hearted take on coming out of the closet yet, at the same time, brought to light the emotional roller-coaster that most of us have to ride on at some stage or another when sweeping our closets clean of our gay skeletons. Totally devoid of gratuitous male nudity, the producers did a good job of presenting a rather tired coming out theme in a very different light - finding oneself doesn't always lead to true love although, if one wants to find true love, one certainly needs to find oneself first. While it may not be the most memorable gay-themed movie I've ever watched, it's certainly worth watching."
3,Okay,I am not too impressed with is this movie. I was expecting more acting but all I got was a story from Dorian's point of view. It is not a movie that I will watch again.
5,A paradigm shift based based on respected research,"This book by Velikovsky presents an interesting investigation of how the traditions, myths, and documented histories of many peoples from around the world can be taken seriously and viewed as the presentation of real events. While some people scoff and ridicule his senario of these stories, others will look at it and conclude that he has done a noble job of pioneering and theorizing. What the detractors of these works by Velikovsky have NOT done is present a compelling explanation of the data which Velikovsky presents. All they have done or seem capable of doing is to ridicule the multitude of witnesses from the past. What those people clearly seem to be motivated by is not honest investigation, but their ""religious"" extremism that insists that What You See Is What Was Always Seen (WYSIWWAS). Open your mind and consider a view that is not politically correct."
4,The beginning of the End,"Read this book twenty years ago. Found it fascinating then, and still is. With all the talk of 2012, this book fits in. Scientists still ponder his ideas. Very exciting and informative reading."
1,Wandering planets,"In this non-fiction book from many years ago, we are told how the planet Venus wandered from its orbit, causing many events from ancient history and the Bible. Since Venus leaving its eliptical orbit around the sun is somewhat less likely than the United States of America lifting off the ground and floating away, the amazing thing is that people actually believe this nonsense, and yet they do. And they call scientists narrow minded for not considering that maybe the law of gravity is wrong. What seems narrow minded to me is a love of nonsense combined with a lack of interest in basic science."
2,I can't finish this thing.,"I've tired twice to read this book and both times I was unsuccessful. I just can't finish 'Worlds in Collision'. Velikovsky here tries to related Biblical stories to the passing of Venus through the solar system. His thoery is that Venus was spat out of Mars and was a comet.He cites literature from all across the world from ancient cultures to prove his point more strongly. I don't know how credible his theories are but his histroy seems off balance and his science seems very ignorant. Read only if you are curious, but very few people would actually take this seriously."
3,"A fun read, but not to be taken too seriously.","It's really fun to read the stories. It's tempting to imagine them to be naturalistic and scientific explanations for the miraculous events described by the Bible and other sacred texts.Unfortunately there is little actual evidence that the fantastic events described by Velikovsky actually occurred, and much evidence to the contrary. As attractive as it is to believe otherwise, most ancient myths are just that, myths. To infer more is little more than wishful thinking and fantasy."
3,Koo - Koo for Co - Co Puffs! Good clean fun...,"This book is a lot of fun, and worth reading. I dont understand all the fuss over its publication however. Anybody who reads this book will understand what a goofball this guy must have been.His theories are right up there with hollow-earth and flat-earth ""Science"". But that doesn't mean that the book isn't an enjoyable read.Just remember if your mind is TOO open, your brain might fall out and bounce on the kitchen floor. Messy..."
3,Best-selling crackpot revisionism,"Forget everything you know about history. And physics. And astronomy. And chemistry. And geology. It's ALL WRONG. Dr Velikovsky showed the way more than 40 years ago, and gulls are still flocking, it seems. Well-written, but so hopelessly wrong-headed that it is likely to be of interest only to scientific illiterates or those amused by pseudo-scientific balderdash & the limits of human credulity. Entertaining, but not science"
2,Why all the fuss?,"An enjoyable bit of quackery. The science is hardly solid to even a layman's honest objectivity, but there is some interesting, if fanciful, food for thought. A thorough example of alternative extremism, it is none the less creative and interesting when not taken too seriously. A true case of ""speculative fiction""."
5,Well worth reading,"A Christmas Sermonis well worth reading. It reminds of us how we should live our lives --- example --We are not damned for doing wrong, but for not doing right.This sermon is also included inThe Giant Christmas Collection: 30 Stories, 25 Poems, and 75 Carols."
2,Boring,What a boring and depressing read this was! Christmas Sermon for who? The clinically depressed? Well at least the price was right. Ya gotta love your Kindle!
3,preachy speech from grandma,Listen if you want a how-to self-help speech old school this is for you. For me it was like being slapped by a nun for laughing in church.
3,Flaws keep this from rating higher,"The frame itself is beautiful, and would get 5/5 if not for some design flaws. First it is too narrow for the license plate to tuck behind it. I had to trim my plate to make it fit. Next, even though it comes with very nice stainless screws (two sets!) the snap on Infiniti covers won't fit the fine threaded set. I reused the stock ones which did fit.The plate does look very nice once it's on though."
4,One thing more,"Informative. A good read. Well written. Sincere. Believable. Almost. If you understand that Love is the essence of consciousness and the life force, then there is still much to be experienced and learned by all races, theirs and ours. We are in the soup together."
5,Marcia Schafer,"If you really want to know what your true beginnings are, then this book is a must read. It' a reality check. We don't know 10% of what is going on in the real world, but we will in a few years. Most everything you thought was the truth, will drop down to your ankles.[...]"
2,Disapointing and Choppy,"Sorry, but I just didn't find this book worth the read. The style was choppy with little sipnets about a lot of different events. While I appreciated the reference to a frequency for truth with each of us...this one didn't ring any bells. The Others dismiss the Bible as not relevant - guess they didn't read the parts about Chariots of Fire and angelic visitors. Ms. Shafer continually refers to herself as having a scientific approach and mind. I didn't find that so."
5,Great for learning useful vocabulary words,This book teaches you many words that are used in the in the everyday world.
2,Word Wealth Review,"I had to read this heinous book in Humanities class, and I am glad to say that I am emancipated from it. My school owes the entire class restitution for making us use this novel. However, I refuse to become maudlin about this book. The only advantage to using it is that you learn big words like these, and can annoy people by using them."
2,Not her best,"I adore Ani but this album is not so great. It doesn't have as much of the syncopated rhythms that I'm so fond of in Ani's other music. The whole album is sort of monotone and the only lyrics that I find very poignant are those in ""Unrequited"". If you're going to buy a ""new"" Ani album, I'd definitely choose ""Knuckle Down"" over this one."
2,Ani at her most boring,"One thing I always admired about Ani is that with each album she's not afraid to try something different. From her early coffee shop folk days to her jazzy period to now, one can never expect the same thing from our favorite Righteous Babe.Unfortunately, Ani misses her mark on this album. Ani's a great lyricist, but here she focuses too much on the lyrics, leaving the melodies to be BORING! She plucks only a few notes on her guitar throughout the songs, as if she's only trying to create some background ambiance and nothing more. You'll enjoy the album more if you just read the lyrics and not listen to the CD at all...which is maybe what Ani wants you do to.I would recommend you buy ""Knuckle Down,"" ""Evolve,"" or ""Not a Pretty Girl"" instead."
3,The most mellow Ani Album,"Well, I for one was a bit disappointed after waiting over a year for a new album. It seems long and drawn out, kind of depressing. The music is beautiful but I guess I was just looking for something more upbeat. I'm a huge Ani fan. Like Picasso, she must be in her 'blue' period. Truly beautiful music on this album, but I didn't hear the usual giggley and bubbly Ani."
4,Chilled album with brilliant lyrics.,"I've been a fan of Ani's music for six years. I own all her albums and love each one differently. This time around, I fell in love once again. The vibe on this record is so chill and laid back. I love how she portrays her political views as well as her personal views. Those views ring similair to my own. Songs like, ""Reprieve"" ""Millenium Theatre"" ""Decree"" and ""Shroud"" should be the soundtrack to the world we live in today. While songs like ""Unrequited"" and ""Nicotine"" hit right at home in my heart. If your a true Ani fan, you'll love this album. If you're used to the sing-along big band songs of the past Ani albums, you might want to stick to those albums, or evolve like Ani and the rest of us"
1,Ani's Worst Album,"She's been on a downslide for the last couple of years, but to judge by this cd its getting worse. She tries to ryhme words with themselves, she continues on the completely mined-out vein of politically complaining that has replaced all her other subject matter lately, she's forgotten any way to show emphasis or go for emotional impact other than just repeating the first verse as the last verse, apparently...I can't find a good thing to say about this one, which is a real shame because Ani is one of the only artists out there today who could fairly and without exaggeration be called both a poet and a geniusShe needs to take some time off and get some new material and new inspiration though, and until she does I'm afraid all her cds will be as bad as, or worse than, this one. I would give it zero stars if i could"
5,Redemption,"I give this album five stars because Ani has redeemed herself. The other reviewer that said this one blows Knuckle Down out of the water is right. If you like Ani as I do, you need to get this album. It's the perfect blend of the old and the new. Her guitar playing on this one is reminiscent of some of her early stuff as well as some of the new ones. I would definitely say that Reprieve is one of her best albums in recent years."
5,Don't Skip This Book,"Sylvia McClain has written a heart-wrenching, sometimes funny, always revealing memoir about her life. The first vignette immediately grabbed my attention and my heart. After reading what she endured physically, psychologically and emotionally when she was young, I had to stop, take a breath, and say, ""Thank God she survived."" After shedding a few tears, I quickly picked up the book again to read more about a woman who forged ahead in spite of a rough beginning.One of my favorite sections of the book had me laughing out loud at how she handled a rather embarrassing situation. McClain's vignettes reveal how she shows her resilience at stressful times. The many thought provoking sections of her book, especially on making an important career change, have made me examine my own life and reflect on how I became the person I am. I want to read more about McClain's life. Sylvia McClain's book is well worth the money."
5,The Swing Era,"If you love the swing era, this DVD is for you. Not only do you have Benny Goodman, but the stars who played with him are what made swing the great period that it was. Gene Kruppa stands out in particular. As this was taken from old movies, the picture quality may not be what one might hope, but I bought the record to listen to the music and I was not disappointed."
4,Benny Goodmans's Story,"This DVD production is about the life and times of musical great Benny Goodman. It is not a presentation of complete performances. It would have been nice to have had at least several complete performances from beginning to end , perhaps as bonus tracks. However, the clips that were briefly presented were fabulous. Other reviewers have stated in more detail the specifics of this DVD especially all of the collaborations of the other great musical talents of the time. This is a must have DVD for Benny Goodman fans. I will only give this 4 stars because of the annoying way the clips were edited."
2,Only for kids,"If you have children of an age of around 10, who are interested in Steam Locomotives, this may be the book for them. But if you are an adult with some background in railroads, well see above...Paul"
5,A must read book for anyone who loves trains or technology,"My 10 year old son and I read this book together and loved it. We are both train and locomotives fans but despite what we knew we both learned more. This book is expecially good for kids since it is told through the eyes of an 18 year old boy, but is equally interesting for adults."
2,"Tries to cover all the bases, but very light on substance.","This would be for the novice traveler who needs guidance on the basics of airline ticketing and travel. Too anectodal for a guide, and difficult to scan and find the information you want. I've not been to Paris (yet) but I still could spot mistakes."
2,Full of gross errors in French names and places,"This is all right for a new traveler to Paris, but the names of French places and the accent marks on French words are about 80% incorrect. e.g. ""Insstitue du Donde [Monde] arabe,"" ""Sacre Cour [Sacré c|ur]"" inconsistent accents on common French words."
5,Best Guide Book to Have on Your First Trip to Paris!,"I bought this book second hand and took it with us on our first trip to Paris. Although some of the smaller pocket guides are also handy, this book really made our (my!) trip. It was a constant source of great info on how to get around Paris by using the Metro and bus system. It also provided excellent info on many small, local points of intrest (don't miss out on Jo Goldenbergs restaraunt; great food, reasonable cost & marvelous entertainment!) The only small problem I could find is that the prices refered to in the book were listed in French Francs. As everything in Paris is now in Euros, it took a little searching to discover that, at last calculation, $1.00 was approximately 7 FF. As Paris is an expensive city to visit, this book more than paid for its cost.... Not to mention it being a great conversational subject for my girlfriend & me! It's a great book to have, whether you're on a budget or not."
3,This is a paperback facsimile of the original hardcover.,This is not a hardcover book! It is a paperback facsimile of the hardcover.
3,Wait for the Video Collection,"The Bouncing Off the Ceiling/Mamma Mia DVD is alright. I love the video for Bouncing Off the Ceiling. It's very bright and fast-paced and has great choreography. I also like the fact that the Mamma Mia video is included. It was the first A*Teens video I saw a few years ago and got me hooked on them, so it was nice to see it on the DVD.The DVD is awesome quality, but it is SO short. A few more videos or photo gallery or something would have made it a much better buy. My suggestion is to purchase the upcoming video collection DVD."
4,GooD,"The A*TEENS first DVD Single was okay, but it's like only 7 minutes long! And after those seven minutes are over it leaves you begging for more... But it is still AWESOME! and shows how the A*TEENS are movin' on up in america. It includes the Mamma Mia and Bouncing Off the Ceiling Videos."
3,the 1st A-Teens DVD Single!,"well, this DVd is so regular 'cause is just a DVD Single with the videos ""Bouncing Off The Ceiling (Upside Down)"", and ""Mamma Mia"", the audio is very good."
2,"The taste is horrid, unfortunately","Wow, the taste of this supplement is nasty. It's really too bad because it seems to work really well. It says it tastes like ""tangerine"" (which I didn't really believe; all vitamin liquids have at least a not-so-great taste), but it tastes like vomit scented with tangerine. I hate to say it that way, but it does. I took it with my nose held and chased it with pure honey and it still had some nasty flavor left over in my throat. And the taste lingered for awhile. Really disappointing because it's a good vitamin but has proven impossible for me to take. I'll finish the bottle, but I dread taking it every day."
2,P-U,"Based on all the rave reviews read on the product, I thought this would be the one I would go with for my toddler son to use as a natural mosquito repellent. While there is a faint orange scent and taste, it is completely overtaken by the icky vitiman smell and taste. I guess there just is no way around that with a B vitamin. They sure tried. I tried too. Tried sneaking it into my son's juice, but he quickly caught on. So, ask me where the bottle is now. Collecting dust on the shelf."
2,these ARE just fishing stories,"In contrast to the other reviewers, I would have to say that these are primarily fishing stories, with personal relationships playing a secondary role. None of the stories really grabbed me and I found the writing to be nothing spectacular. I enjoyed Mr. Fromm's other work more (ie., Indian Creek Chronicles)."
5,Cute and Memorable!,"I remembered these songs from when I was a kid. I memorized my phone number, learned how to get help when I was lost, and learned what to say to drugs all from this music. I wasn't sure if rose-tinted memories made me overly nostalgic, but decided to download the digital version of all three CDs and workbooks from Brite Music; ""Personal Safety,"" ""Play it Smart"" (about drugs,) and ""Protect Their Minds."" Within just a couple of listens, my five- and two-year-old kids were singing along.This is a great way to teach kids how to be safe in a way that they like and understand. It has also opened up great dialogue with my kids about bullies and other problems. I highly recommend it."
3,Too absolute in its message,"The illustrations are cute and the story is too but I don't like the ending. Princess Smarty-Pants is only a child. Of course she isn't ready to get married. But who knows if she may change her mind in 10 years or so? How long exactly is ""ever-after""? Or if a prince isn't to her liking, maybe a princess? I realize this is a childrens' book but I don't like the absoluteness of the solution."
1,Cute Title But All Downhill from There,"This book is just horrible... anti-marriage and anti-man. If you're bitter and you want your daughter to grow up the same way, then this is the book for you. Otherwise, opt for more wholesome entertainment."
2,Is this the message I want to send my daughters?,"Although the book is amusing, it's so hostile to the opposite sex, I don't want my daughters reading it. The princess is a spoiled brat that plays mean tricks on stupid men. What is that teaching my children?Princess Knight by Cornelia Funke is a much more positive, upbeat book that gives young girls a message that they can be strong and independent with or without a husband. This book portrays men as arrogant and ignorant. I hope my girls grow up with a different idea in mind. I hope they see the good in both sexes instead of demeaning the value of men."
3,"I'm Mixed- Like the Idea, but Felt Parts of This Were a Little Mean","I'm mixed on this book. I love the idea of turning the princess/prince-charming theme on its head. Goodness knows our girls get inundated with it. But like others who read it, I actually didn't find this that amusing, partly because the 'tests' that Princess Smartypants subjects the prospective princes too are a little mean. In fact, the whole book has a little bit of 'mean girls' undertone that bugged me (and that's another theme our girls get plenty of.) That being said, I'm still reading it to my daughters if they ask, and I try and have a sense of humor about it when we read it, which takes the edge off. But I wish someone would do this theme in a way that focused more on empowerment and less on gender-divisiveness..."
3,Not THAT Amusing,"I decided to check this out from the library before buying it. I'm glad I did. I'm all for women being able to be on their own and all that, but I really did not like this book. It was cute.. but I'm not planning on buying it.The Paper Bag Princess by Munsch is a much better book and teaches the same sort of lesson. I recommend checking that book out instead."
5,And she DID live happily after!,"Princiess Smartypants is a wonderful role model for independent young girls who use their wits to achieve their goals. I can envision second and third grade girls roaring in glee, while boys of the same age applauding her."
1,Horrific,"This book was given to my daughters as a gift from my sister. I was horrified when I read it. The objective appears to be to teach young girls to be snarky, self-centered, sexist little jerks. I look for books that teach my children to be self-confident and self-reliant. In attempting do to so, this book actually does the opposite. The main character is little more than a self-absorbed young lady with complete disregard for others. Some may find the way in which she turns away suitors to be entertaining. But even from a literary standpoint, its gets old quickly. If you are looking for a book that can teach young girls how respect that which is most precious to them and not be at the whim of every suitor, I highly recommendPrincess & the Kiss: A Story of God's Gift of Purity."
1,Not the type of Princess I want my girls to be like,Princess Smartypants is basically glorifying a spolied brat who is mean and vindictive and not very nice. We got this book for as a gift read it once and into the trash it went. Not a good message for little girls.
1,A spoiled brat makes a lousy heroine.,"Babette Cole wrote one terrific book Prince Cinders -- that turns a fairy tale on its head. Princess Smartypants is similar to Prince Cinders, but it isnt nearly as good. The idea of a princess who has lots of interests of her own and no desire to sit around waiting for a prince to come along and save her is a good one. But Smartypants is such an annoying character that the whole thing falls apart, I think. In order to discourage her suitors, Smartypants makes up tasks they have to complete before they can claim her hand. The tasks are mean and pointless, and the princess comes across, to me at least, as a spoiled brat. A princess waiting for Prince Charming may be a lousy role model for young girls, but this bratty princess is no improvement. If youre looking for an antidote to too many fairy tales, there are lots of better alternatives..."
3,I don't like Princess Smartypants very much,"She kissed him and turned him into a frog. I didn't like that because he did all the things she said, and she didn't like it. People should do what they say they will do. And her pets were monsters, so he could have stayed at the castle.I liked that she didn't turn the others into frogs. I liked the pictures.(Tim, age 5)"
1,Terrible Book,"I bought this book for a friend's daughter's 6 year birthday. I will not be giving this book. It is about a spoiled brat who, when foiled, has a tantrum and turns the offending prince into a toad.She will be getting ""The Storytelling Princess,"" ""The Apple-Pip Princess,"" and something to replace this book..."
2,Ends way better then it begins and middles,"A few songs point the way towards better things to come, though most becomes buried underneath audio irrelevance. Kowtow is competent 80's synth-rock, but sounds too dated for my tastes- they clearly offer better ahead and would only be recommended for completists or 80's prog enthusiasts."
5,X-Men The Movie. Lady Liberty,"The toy X-Men:Lady Liberty is really cool! I use my Wolverine, Cyclops, Sabertooth, and Magneto action figures when I play with this toy set. I think the Lady Liberty set looks just like the real thing! I like the action figures too. I think any kid who likes toys still would love this toy set. I know I do. I recomend this to anybody. 5 stars!"
2,Too much constant powerhouse singing.,"Nice music, but constant powerhouse dynamics tends to take away the beauty of it. This is especially evident in the popular tunes of this collection."
2,Would be nice if it said LIVE somewhere...,"There is an applause at the beginning and end of each song. Quality is ok but not fantastic. For $10, wish it was higher quaity."
4,Great voices,"The three tenors are wonderful. I would have preferred this to not be sung before a live audience. I do not like tapes where I have to listen to applause after every song. I want pure, uninterrupted music. Loved the songs!"
3,This was a gift,This was a gift. I will not recommend it as I have not heard it. It was requested and fulfilled by me.
3,good companion,"This was also a good gift along with my purchase of the Irish Tenors, A bit more serious and intense but very uplifting especially for some one who is not a big opera/classics fan"
4,beautiful meat and hands,"Keep your eyes on this band.With the release of this third album, Luxury reaches new bookshelves not attempted by other christian artists. It seems a shame to me that it has taken this long for christian ""art"" topoke the white wall of creativity, but this album smears itself all over it. 4 stars for creativity, 4 stars for originality, 4 stars for art work! This is a mile ahead of their last two albums, but i don't think that they will stop here. This is a new and exciting sound to so many christian music listening ears, I am sure Luxury is only begining.(if you like radiohead, the smiths, the prayer chain, blur..that kind of thing.)maybe next time they'll get another star!"
2,Nothing Fits!,"This is a beautiful lamp. I saw it in store and had it ordered and shipped to my apartment. Upon opening the box, the Styrofoam exploded everywhere. I don't recommend opening in the house. When I screwed the pole into the base, the hole seemed to be stripped. The pole is wobbly and barely stays in place. The top part where the lamp is does not even fit in the hole on top of the pole. HORRIBLY made and I am severely disappointed for the price that I paid. Will be returning."
3,"nice, but spendy","While these are nice dry bags, tapered to fit in the front of your kayak, they are crazy expensive, which is why I gave a 3-star rating on them. Bang for buck, a person could easily find a less expensive solution. I returned mine, & found a couple of bags on ebay for $10.00 each that fit the bill."
5,Yeehaww,"For me it's perfect. Fits my tent, ground cloth, a few other things and slides right in the center tunnel of my Native Watercraft Manta Ray 12 like it was made for it. Well constructed and sturdy, just like my woman."
4,Great to get all your stuff in hatches,I go on week long kayak/camping trips with my sea/touring kayak (CD Solstice) and always have trouble packing no matter how careful I am. I did a test pack with this bag (haven't used it for a trip yet) and I am excited. I loaded more than I normally bring into the bag and it slipped into my back hatch and slid all the way to the end leaving plenty of extra room for other stuff. Only 4 stars because I think it is a little pricey ($60) for what it is - light/thin material. $30 to $35 would be reasonable.
3,Wrong item,"Be warned that ordering from Euro Food Mart will have you receive the Labello Soft Rose, the newer and inferior substitution for the now-discontinued Velvet Rose. I've heard only good things about Velvet Rose, but unfortunately have not had a chance to try it."
2,Unsure of the hype...,"I don't see what all the hype is about with this. It smells nice, it leaves a light tint, and is semi-moisturizing, but I can honestly get the same results with the Abba chapsticks I get from the grocery store. I feel like this leaves a weird film on my lips and they get that weird white stuff built up on them. Gross, yes, but this is the only chapstick this happens with. Not a fan."
1,Are you kidding me? DO NOT BUY THIS,"It's really pretty unbelievable that books like this are published. I am sure Prof Wagman had successful years in academia in his heyday, but gimmie a break.The book's first chapter mostly comprises of short 3-sentence paragraphs with no interlocking structure whatsoever. And from there, each chapter is basically quoting HUGE chunks of other people's work. Chapter 5, for example, is about 2% his words, and 98% just citing huge chunks of other peoples' work. And he has a short 4-5 sentence paragraph at the end that he calls a ""commentary"" and there's a chapter! Unbelievable.For this to be $95 new is ridiculous. Either (a) check it out at your library or (b) don't bother. Not even the bibliography is worth it."
5,Great care was taken to be accurate...,"There was a clear and consistent effort to be as accurate and authentic as possible in the creation of this DVD series. The historical recreations are intense, layered and detailed with great care in the special effects and historical truth and authenticity along with the powerful voice of narrator Coby Batty and other voice actors help to bring these stories of the Medal of Honor to life for a mass audience - from the Civil War to the War in Afghanistan."
2,a pretty 25 minute DVD,"This DVD is pretty. But, as it does not disclose on the cover, it is only 25 minutes long, er, short! It's just too short. It does identify about a dozen sea creatures, and it does take you to a few dive spots. That's it. And as to the non-English support, it has no subtitles (the fish ID's were subtitled only) -- only dubbing.Watch it once and you'll never watch it again. It was a waste of money for me."
5,"Small, but cute.",This is the small version of Herder the Dog. The picture looks like the larger Herder beanie baby my daughter received in 2001. I was a little disappointed when it arrived. I was not aware that Herder came in two different sizes.
3,"This is good, but they're GONNA be great...","Part of this terrific ""new"" wave of female rockers, Sahara Hotnights...you just gotta love that name...put together a fairly decent album.The group is tight, the tunes speed along briskly and many of the melodies are hummable.It's not a great album, but it almost is. It lacks maybe a little better production, or one to two killer tunes...it's a difficult-to-define something that the girls just miss.Having said that, I leave with two thoughts:1) They're only going to get better. Listening to this makes you want to hear their next one...2) You can better believe I'm going to BUY that next one too! This is a band to root for..."
4,Jennie Bomb,"Sahara Hotnights might be the latest Swedish import but they certainly mark themselves as one of the best. These four ladies bring classic punk rock hooks with just enough of a pop sensibility to make them more palatable to the masses and easier to digest than other like-minded Scandinavian bands - The Hives and The International Noise Conspiracy. *Jennie Bomb* certainly makes the aforementioned boys jealous of the girls' firepower instantly exploding with eleven songs in thirty-two minutes. ""On Top Of The World"" and ""Fire Alarm"" are from the punk album No Doubt never made as lead singer Maria Andersson comes off as a prettier Joan Jett fronting the Ramones. Sahara Hotnights are posed to break big with *Jennie Bomb* and it won't be long until their name is mentioned with the same reverence of other grrrl rawkers Sleater Kinney and L7."
2,whaa?,"OK, I guess I didn't actually hear this album, but I saw them live and they must've played most of the songs off it. They also must've learned how to play guitars last week because they aren't too proficient on them. I know this rock and roll revival is cool and everything, but not every new band like this is good. Unfortunately they will probably make it big because they are the ""swedish girl band"" and one of them is dating the singer of the Hives. I give them 2 stars because at least they're not blonde."
5,Outstanding music from Russian choral religious tradition,"The seventeen selections on this CD cover a range of styles and musical traditions from the 15th century chant styles, through the 19th and 20th centuries. The Slavyanka Chorus was founded in 1979 in San Francisco. This album of liturgical music was recorded in celebration of the Millenial anniversary of Russian Orthodoxy. The pieces are performed in Church Slavonic, still the written and spoken language of the Russian Orthodox Church. A booklet accompanying the CD gives the Church Slavonic, Russian, English, French and German translations of the text. It would be exciting to hear more from this group of performers."
2,Great music ..... but with one problem,"Music is great, but there is one problem, maybe only English speaking customers doesn't notice that problem...., where is point? It's seems strange to listen when male choir whose native language is English performs Russian liturgical and sacred songs - it seems very strange and little bit funny. I understand that English speaking customers can't differentiate between real Russian speaking male choir performance and English speaking male choir. But everyone who is fluent in Russian immediately will notice that difference, especially when Russian liturgical songs sounds with English accent. It's a very sad ...."
2,"Uneven production levels, music only okay","Sadly, there are some serious problems with extraneous noise and volume irregularity on this disc.Some of the cuts are more clear than others, and all are exuberantly sung. I would prefer more texture from this very rich musical heritage."
2,I wouldn't waste my time...,"I wasn't impressed with this unit at all.I bought it to use with a back up camera that I borrowed (it was being used as a second unit for guest photos at a wedding).The flash went through rechargeable batteries fast (faster than on my Sigma unit I also used at the same event), and it took a LONG time to charge between flashes.As for being compact and easy to store I give it A, but for usability D.I don't think regular people (non-photographers or even hobbyists) would have much use out of it; once its charged you've most likely missed your shot already.I think I'll stick with my Sigma 500 DG Super from now on, even on back ups and second units. And I'd recommend others to look elsewhere as well, the difference of [...] bucks really does make a difference believe it or not."
3,Basic Flash,"The positive: efficient, works well with my Rebel XT , less expensive than canon The negative: built quality not the best, very basic not strong enough not cheap enough for what it is. Built quality 6, performance 7, price 7. Conclusion not bad for a short budget amateur photographer"
3,NEWBIE SAYS,"It worked okay but I ordered a Canon 580EX that I like much better. The Canon has greater control and shoots farther, of course you pay a big price difference."
2,Disappointing,I seldomly fail to complete a novel of intrigue. I tried to remain patient hoping that something would develop that captured my imagination but nothing did. I put the book back on the bookshelf without completing it.
1,Don't buy this DVD,I join with the others who expressed great dismay at the absolutely unacceptable quality of this DVD transfer. The manufacturer should recall this product and give each buyer a new version or their money back.
3,Awesome footage,"Watched the Imax DVD last night.The footage is amazing, but quality ofthe picture is very poor. Could notread the final commentary as the wordswere out of focus. This is a greatpity. I have rated it 3 stars dueto the poor quality of the transfer.Also sound at times was not the best.Will watch it again sometime though.It is an awesome sight seeing theseoil wells burning."
1,Great Film WASTED with horrible DVD print!,"I have seen the film ""Fires of Kuwait"" in my local IMAX theater years ago. It was, and still is, the best of many great IMAX features.It shocks me to see this DVD, however. The quality is horrible. The print on DVD is actually out of focus! and the sound is so muddy that I have to use the subtitles to understand what is said. For a technology that has been around long wnough to perfect, they really fouled up on this release. I have seen better quality from bootlegs.I am returning this print on DVD in hopes to maybe get another that might be in focus. (And I hope this is just an isolated case.) But I have the sinking feeling that this is the fault of the label who transferred it, not the DVD manufacturer.BE VERY CAREFUL IN BUYING THIS DVD!!!!!!!!!"
3,Disappointing DVD transfer,"I purchased this DVD after watching Werner Herzog'sLessons of Darkness. I was sorely disappointed by the DVD transfer quality from the source. The picture was interlaced and blurry. I expected better coming from IMAX.As for the actual content, I though it was mediocre. The film glossed over too many details. I would have enjoyed more in-depth explanations of the information presented."
2,poor quality,Loved the content but the picture quality was worse than VHS. Viewing this video on a large plasma was pretty dreadful. Give me the HD version with improved picture and I'd give this 5 stars.
3,Great cinematography,"This video is WONDERFUL in the cinematography that it has. Unfortunately, the writers and directors failed to properly tell the story. Thankfully, they didn't have a bias but were looking at just telling the story, but the need to tell us a little more. There was no map of where in Kuwait the fires were. The audio between the ambient sounds and the narrative voice-overs occasionally blended too well.If you are looking for a DVD with a lot of oil well fires, great cinematography, and a little historical background - this one is for you.If you are seeking a little more in the Gulf War and it's ramafications, you might want to consider a different source.Pretty good - needed a little more work with the story."
3,"Should have been titled ""Buy our Newspaper""","Overall not a bad book but I found it didn't go into enough depth on some topics and often didn't fully explain the jargon before launching into a technical discussion. Look at the cover, notice ""Investing"" is in a font several points larger than ""Personal Finance"". This accurately summarizes the content of this book as it devotes more time to investing.However, what really disappointed me were the numerous pages devoted to interpreting the charts and tables published in the Financial Post newspaper. It even goes so far as to mention what days of the week certain features are published. As if this is the only source of financial news and information. And no surprise there is little mention of alternate sources such as specific web sites or other publications. With that amount of advertising I expect a lower price or a free subscription."
3,Did not last as long as expected,The frying pans are well built. But the Teflon coating starts to come-off after a couple of years. But we still use the pans since we like the size and the very heavy duty base ion the pan.
5,Great clean humor! I really enjoyed the family humor.,This is great humor. I'v caught his act. He really reads the audience. Great stuff about the family.
3,The product is cheaply made,I would not purchase this again it is cheaply made cast iron and pot metal. The valves install very close to the wall so that they are unable to be full opened unless you somehow extend it from the wall.
3,"The ""Duke's"" First Starring ""B"" Western","John Wayne's first starring ""B"" Western and the first of a series of six made by Warner Bros. may be the best of his ""B"" Western output. Good direction and production make this one and the entire series a good one. The studio dressed him like Ken Maynard and put him on a horse similar to Tarzan, so they could use action footage from Maynard's old films. ""Ride Him Cowboy,"" for instance is a remake of the 1926 ""The Unknown Cavalier."""
3,Early Wayne Western,"John Wayne(and his horse Duke) appear in this B Western from the early 1930s. These films are all about the same-pleasent to watch, but not the greatest entertainment in history. Note that in this film the costar is Duke the horse."
5,"Great- but ""Hello Little Girl""","There are so many wonderful things about this show. I do dislike the fact that different names are used throughout the DVD for characters. My other criticism is the fact that ""Hello Little Girl"" should be cut. It is just weird. I understand its purpose, but it sounds weird. They could have found a better song.My favorite songs are ""Unworthy of Your Love"", ""More"", ""Marry Me A Little"", and Ruthie's part in ""Everday A Little Death"".Ruthie Henshall, Bronson Pinchot, and Carool Burnette really have awesome stage presence. John Barrowman's voice is just so darn good that anything he does is perfect. George Hearn has an okay voice and zero stage presence. His dancing in ""Back In Business"" is terrible. My only criticism for Ruthie Henshall is the fact that it looks as though she sings through her teeth.""BANG!"" IS AMAZING!Songs I dislike: Putting It Together, Hello Little Girl, Waltz, Back In Business, and Like It Was.Great DVD!"
2,Who did the audio?,"I was enjoying this show until the second act. The audio falls out often after that. How they can sell it seemed to be beyond me. Still it is a record of a B'way show. As far as I am concerned every B'way should be preserved before it closes. I am all for preserving the performences and staging, leaving it for future generations to enjoy. ""Is anybody there? Does anybody care?"" Lets save it for prosperity and for those who can't afford to get to NYC to see it!! There might be profits to be made after the show closes!!!!!!! Especially if the audio remains after the first act."
5,Awesome Cast,The entire cast is memorable in this adaptation of Sondheim. John Barrowman is just incredible as is Carol Burnett. I remember this showing originally on HBO and liked it then. The only thing better would have been Bernadette!
4,A Sondheim Jewel,"From start to finish a marvelous evening of Broadway in your own home. The performers are at the top of their craft, and the musical arrangements from various shows are artfully blended. A winner on all counts. Thank you Mr. Sondheim for your creativity that provides viewers with such a literate and pleasureable musical treat."
3,more of a show than a play...,"The staging is forced and stiff and the plot barely existent -- I have to say I enjoy listening to the original cast recording more than watching this staged production, but it's never a waste of time to watch talented performers singing Sondheim's marvelous songs. George Hearn's energy can't match his costars', and, while Bronson Pinchot's singing is better than Christopher Durand's in the original, he can never match Durand's arch hilarity. Still, each singer gets to shine in individual moments, the greatest of which is Carol Burnett's ""Ladies Who Lunch"" -- a song I never cared for until I saw/heard her furious interpretation. Sondheim purists may object to the way the cast sometimes plays fast-and-loose with tempos, but there's not a bad voice in the bunch and the orchestration is elegant, allowing the singers to shine. Worth watching once, at least."
2,A great deal of puff and fluff,I expected a central theme with an underlying score but all I saw was a disjointed attempt to showcase the various talents. The title says it all Putting it together. Yet. Very disappointing. ECurry
3,Worth seeing,"This show is kind of boring. It has a plot but not a very strong one. The songs are not all that grabbing, all though there are a few show stoppers. If you're a big fan of Sondheim, you'll love it. If you're just a big fan of musicals, this might be worth seeing, but not really worth buying. It comes on HBO a lot so you might be able to catch it there. The performers are excellent though. Carol Burnett is funny in her role, but since there is no dialogue between the characters, there is not many oportunities for her to even try and make the audience laugh. Ruthie Henshall is excellent. Her voice is beautiful and her dancing is remarkable. She and John Barrymore make an excellent and attractive on-stage couple."
1,Save your money,This was not one of the best plays in the world and would be trash if it were not for Carol Burnett lending her name to it. The plot is flimsy and some of the songs painfull to get through. It would be better to watch all the plays the songs were collected from rather than see them in their butchered state.
3,Putting together but did it gel?,A cast that can't go wrong. I really would love to say I like it especially with the incredible Carol Burnette. But... something is missing...I am sure the live show will be a great experience to watch but how come it didn't capture in the dvd? still you have to see it at least once.
1,MORE CURIOUS.... BUT NOT TOO SUBLIME SCHUBERT,"In my review of 23 October 2000, I found the Mozartean's performance of the Schubert Op. 100 wanting in nuance, depth and feeling, all enhanced by particularly poor sound quality and the use of historical instruments. If possible, the Op. 99, here, fares no better and, in many ways, seems even more superficial, routine and annoying. Not even the inclusion of the berceuse-like Adagio (Notturno) in E-flat, nor the exhilarating Allegro in B-flat, both shorn of their burnished warmth, improves matters in the least. A most disappointing issue on all counts.[Running time: 59:43]"
3,pretty good dvd,"This dvd is one of the best blink-182 dvds you can ever think of , because the two blink-182 music videos on it are very good. Man Overboard is very good because there cool tiny people running around town naked. Adam's song is good because it's a slow song and a cool video and in the video there is cool pictures on the wall behind Blink-182 singing."
3,Touching romance,"There is more than a hint of the Oscar winning Marty in this quiet and well obseved drama ,shot in luminous black and white by Roberet Barr and directed with ecconomy and restraint by Martin Ritt.Anthony Quinn palys a widower who falls in love with Rose Bianco -the Black Orchid of the title.She is a widow whose husband was entangled with the mob and killed in a mob hit.She is eking out a living working in an artificial flower company and worrying about her son who is a persistent escapeee from the county farm.Initially resistant she soon falls heavily for Quinn's rough hewn charms but there is an obstacle -the staunch opposition of his possessive daughter ,played by Ina Balin.The movie is the story of the courtship and its eventual resolution .Sterling performances by the leads and a strong musical score by Alessandro Cicognini compensate for the slighly over sentimental script but overall this a neglected little gem"
2,Mama I'm Happy,"This movie has it all. Cheap sets, artificial lighting, melodramatic music and over-acting. Anthony Quinn is the only character that is remotely plausible and also the only reason I give this debacle 2 stars. If you are expecting a glamorous Sophia to make up for the movies flaws...don't. She spends the entire movie in basically the same black dress and pulled up hair-don't."
1,Don't believe the people who say it fits a toddler bed!,"A couple of other reviews talk about this product working with a toddler bed even though the description says twin or queen, so I ordered it. Big mistake. It does not fit a toddler bed! Maybe the other reviewers and I have different definitions for ""toddler bed."" The instructions for my little guy's crib says it converts to a toddler bed by removing a rail, so I'm referring to something that uses the same mattress as a crib. It definitely requires at least a twin size mattress as stated in the item description. This one stays in the garage for a while."
2,Not safe enough,"Its low set. If a pillow gets beside it, its not hard to roll over the pillow and then over the rail. Its short when on a full or queen bed. I feel that I have to have two side-by-side on each side."
3,"not quite ""the one""","Mine looks crooked and kinda weird. I will probably take it back. You're not supposed to use it with a bunk bed, which is what I have, but I can't find any that are made for a lower bunk. I could get this one to work, but it just looks funny and I'm not sure I like it. I do like that it comes in pink or blue, and the price is nice, but I'm not sure it's ""the one"" for us. I guess I'll keep shopping.I really don't understand these bed rails. none of them are meant for toddler beds or bunk beds, but only for twin beds. Then they have the plastic that attaches to the other side of the mattress and it seems to me that it would make a gap between the bed and the wall on some beds. Strangely all the photos on the boxes are of a bed in the middle of the room, not against a wall, as if the child is only going to roll off the one side with the bed rail."
2,Can do better.,"They were easy to install, but are very difficult to put up and down. Awkward. They aren't all that sturdy either."
1,Did not fit our Queen,We had to return the bedrail. The anchors were about 4 inches too short for our Queen sized bed.
4,A must for rollers,"My son was too big for a crib and too restless for a twin bed. This was great. We pushed the bed up against the wall and put this on the other side.The bottom part actually latches onto the box spring so you don't have to worry about when weight leans on the bed rail. It's not going anywhere. No more waking up in the middle of the night to a loud ""THUD"" when he hit the floor. It's great to wake up in the morning and see my sleepy son still in bed and not in the floor."
5,2 originals of Glenn Hughes is all original.....Rock n Roll...,"Glenn Hughes vocalist/bassist for Deep Purple/Trapeze & many otherbands is also a solo artist that is pretty much ignored in the states.Thanks heavens for Japan & other countries who still know a brillianttalent & keeps Hughes making music. These 2 solo efforts are superiorthan what critics & radio [Springsteen & Joel] called great these days.The way it is/building the machine have rock, funk, slow, blues & evenmodern rock songs! Try songs like the curse, the way it is, too far gone,second son, Can't stop the flood, I will follow you & the haunting bigsky & you will hear the awesome singing, playing & writing of this rocklegend. If you heard of some of his material or just looking for somegreat classsic songwriting this is the man to deliver! The Voice of Rock!"
2,had potential....rip off though,"This movie is a sleep fest. Not alot of gore here either. It also rips off alot of ""the shinning"", so it has lack of originality. with Paris' money, you'd think she could find a more higher budget movie than this, after all she rich beyond any of our minds!"
3,NOT A SCARY HORROR MOVIE,"AS SOON AS THIS BLACK BOOK IS OPENED-THE SUSPENSE,AND EXCITEMENT STARTS.THE BOOK IS EVIL.THE BOOK IS A SPIRIT.NOW THAT THE BOOK IS OPENED-THE SPIRIT GETS INTO THE PERSON WHO OPENS IT,AND THE PERSON STARTS TO KILL PEOPLE.THIS SPIRIT CAN ALSO JUMP FROM PERSON TO PERSON WHO GETS IN CANTACT WITH THE PERSON WHO'S POSSESSED.IT GETS TO THE POINT THAT NOBODY TRUSTS EACH OTHER BECAUSE NOBODY KNOWS WHO'S POSSESSED OR NOT.THERE'S SOME BLOOD.I THINK THIS IS AN INTERESTING MOVIE.IT'S DIFFERENT."
1,the only thing scary about this is the acting,"First off, terrible acting. It seems so unreal. It's just like nine four year olds playing hide and go seek. Paris's character Jo gets killed in the first fifteen minutes after getting a bath, which I can only imagine how much she loved flaunting that body of hers. :( The only thing interesting was the hot British and Scottish actor guys! Other than that, lame lame lame!!!"
3,OK for the genre (2.5/5),"this movie is OK for the horror genre.it's nothing new or special,butthe genre has produced worse.i didn't find the acting all thatbad.again,it wasn't great,but i've seen worse.Paris Hilton is in thisone,and is no better or worse than anyone else in the movie.i didn'tfind the movie particularly scary or thrilling.but then a lot of socalled horror movies aren't scary,merely disgusting.but i did think itwas passable entertainment for 85 minutes or so.if you go in expectingaward winning acting,and anything but a time waster,you'll bedisappointed.if you've never seen one of these types of movies,youmight find it scary.otherwise,just enjoy watching characters doing thestupid things they do in these movies before getting dispatched.forme,Nine Lives is a 2.5/5"
1,"0 STARS: Very poorly acted, unconvincing, uncompelling and lame.","You just about need nine lives to get through this movie alive. In ""Nine Lives"", the acting is wooden and the action is totally unconvincing. The idea and setting of the movie may have worked, but the execution is so bad, the movie is totally uncompelling. None of the characters stick out with any degree of noticeability. Ultimately, ""Nine Lives"" comes across as totally and completely lame. I could barely stomach this movie to the end."
1,AAAAAAAAAA YUCK,Guys you have one good thing about this movie paris hitlton. and even that isn't so good. The acting is how shall I say BAD AWFUL AAAAA NOT GOOD besides the actors being hot this was LAME don't waste that hour and a half of your life. WORST HORROR MOVE EVER. WORST MOVE EVER PERIOD (if you don't count the spice girls movie)
1,Don't waste your time...,"Yes, I know some people will be interested in seeing Paris Hilton act. Let me save you some time: she does an OK job in a forgettable role, then gets killed. Now, having said that, the film is equally forgettable. It is, in one word: boring. Don't waste your time with this one. It is not horrible, it's not the worst movie ever made, it's just boring..."
2,A lame excuse for a horror movie!,"This movie is only worth watching for Paris. It's not scary, it has a recycled plot and crappy dialogue! All of you Paris fans, don't expect much for she is killed off in the first 20 minutes! No nudity on her part either, or any part for that matter! Lame!"
3,Ok,"I really wanted to love this movie, because right on the cover is Paris Hilton, and I LOVE her. So I rented it and she was in it for like 15 minutes and I was really disappointed. I really wanted to see her in a movie.Anyways, it wasn't too scary, but it wasn't terrible. Rent it if you really love Paris or just want to rent a movie for an amusing hour and a half."
3,It's All About Paris,"The only reason anyone watches this is for Paris. Duh, that's why I rented it and that's why she's plastered all over the box. Well, for the first half hour she's in it she's great. She's charming and silly as usual and she makes you smile. If you expect to get a rewarding and profound experience from watching the rest of this campy movie, dream on. Just rent it for Paris like you know you want to."
5,Great Debut!,"I love this CD. I especially like Sarah's interpretation of ""You Don't Know What Love Is,"" because it showcases what I like best about her playing: her compelling and beautiful sound. Looking forward to her next release."
5,"Versatile, Groove-oriented Music","I first heard the music from the CD ""Greenlight"" by Sarah Morrowat a live concert she gave in Paris, France for the JVC Jazz Festival. I loved the music and purchased the CD on the spot!Wanting to give the ""Greenlight"" CD to a friend for his birthday, I was thrilled to find it available on Amazon.com. I find ""Greenlight"" to be very versatile with many different grooves making it interesting from beginning to end. The spirit of the first track, a very innovative spoken intro, is reflected in the music of each subsequent track on the CD. The verve and spirit of each song comes across due to the ingenious playing of Sarah Morrow and her side men coupled with their excellent communication with each other. Sarah's original compositions on the CD are equally as outstanding as the standards. I love this CD and am telling all my friends to check it out! Definitely buy it!!"
1,Not a Man,"Dear reviewer(Josh). I'm not a man at all, or frustrated for that matter. Go listen to Ingrid Jensen, Lynn Airiale, Geri Allen or Terri-lynne Carrington if you want to hear genuinely hard hitting women, or just find a way to listen to the side men on this album. Thanks. Buh-bye."
5,"Great Pen- May I have more, please?","I found this pen just lying around at home, and loved it at first try! It really flows!!!But I can't find it anywhere!!!! Help! I need more.Thank you"
5,FLUENT BALLPOINT PEN,THIS PEN IS ONE OF THE BEST I HAVE. I HAVE HAD IT FOR 2 YEARS NOW AND IT STILL HAS ENOUGH INK TO LAST A COUPLE MORE YEARS. THIS PEN IS TIDE WITH ANOTHER PEN THAT I HAVE. IT IS THE UP&UP RETRACTABLE BALLPIONT PEN. YOU CAN ONLY GET THEM AT TARGET. MY MAIN PROBLEM IS I DONT KNOW WHERE TO BUY MORE! THEY MIGHT NOT MAKE THEM ANYMORE. OVERALL THIS PEN GETS A 5!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,understanding myself,"After reading Stepping Out of the Bubble a year ago, I went back and read it again for a second time. I was able to pick up even more information this time around that helped me understand and overcome some of my own internal conflicts. This is a book you can read at any point in your life and always find information that pertains to that particular moment. Krehbiel has a way of explaining things that others may consider unexplainable. Whether you are a student, a teacher, or just a guy like me, this book can and will change your life."
2,It's all about Ronnie Hudson...,"I'm a sap... I actually bought a CD for ONE SONG instead of downloading it. Ronnie Hudson's 'West Coast Poplock' is great, but the rest is weak. I think you can buy the music from 'GTA: San Andreas' on Amazon, so do that instead because you'll get a lot of other cool music from various genres."
5,Tough Love,"Ousmane Sembene is the Godfather of tough love. In ""Xala"" the likable ""everyman"" is only human. Finding himself immersed in easy money and asking no questions, he goes for the perks enjoyed by ancestral chieftans, throwing a big celebration to take a third wife two generations younger. However after he is dismissive of a prescribed ritual just prior to the wedding night, ""Xala"" the curse descends on him like falling dominoes. A love of people combined with mean spirited humor and a strong ending fire this storytelling into a timeless gem."
5,Xala,This is perhaps Sembene at his greatest. This is an important film that through satire presents the contradictions and issues of neocolonialism. It is a most powerful film.
3,Typically African,"Xala is a poorly made, amatureish film, but it accurately depicts West African big city life in the late 1960s and 1970s and reflects the themes common in African literature of the period. Because it was shot on location, on a documentary level the background setting is an accurate physical view of West African cities and city life at the time--which is why I rate it a 3 instead of a 2. Not a major advancement in filmmaking, but deserving of some recognition for directorial effort."
3,Melodies are great but the lyrics are not,"I think the songs on this CD are beautiful, melodically, but the lyrics are so caught up in death and religion, that it is slightly depressing.The original Grace is Gone, from the Lilywhite sessions, was much more pure and haunting than the jazzed up version on Busted Stuff, which seems to be redesigned to appeal to pop radio.Digging a Ditch is great - Dave Matthews at his best, with a simple, clear melody and guitar accompaniment. Sometimes there is too much added instrumentation in the songs.Overall, the CD is musically really good, but not very uplifting."
3,Not DMB at their best,"While this album is better than ""Everyday,"" I can't honestly say it's better than the other three. The songs are good, but not great. They start out slowly and remain slow, never gaining a pace on any kind. There are a couple of gems on here with ""Grace is Gone"" which sounds like a song Nick Drake would write, and ""Big Eyed Fish."" Overall, however, I feel as though they should have released the Lillywhite sessions as they were and recorded all fresh material for this release."
4,Very Nice Listening,"Ok... I like DMB a lot, especially their older, more raw sounds. But this is a great cd for some nice easily listening. Similar to having Clapton's Pilgram playing while on a road trip or hanging out at the house. Nothing overly impressive, raw or necessarily fresh... but really nice to listen to. There are times I will hear a song on the radio and think ""This sounds like... (whomever)"" and it's not the group, but has a similar sound. Well, I enjoy DMB's sound and this cd has the same feel. It is just good listening. Enjoy."
5,A studio album for the fans,"Ok, so ""Everyday"" wasn't for everyone... It was overly happy and catered to more of a ""pop"" music market. However, Everyday wasn't the album I was waiting for when it came out... Busted Stuff is. It is a return to the great, insightful, soulful, songwriting that most Dave fans have come to expect from the band.From the heavy themes of ""Raven,"" to the beautiful ""Grace is Gone,"" to the solemn confessions of ""Bartender"" this album is held together by solid musicianship and lyrical mastery. A must have for any fan of the band or fan of great songwriting."
1,Busted ...,"I bought ""Busted Stuff"" early this September 2002. I hate to say it, but DMB is going downhill. ""Everyday"" was a step in the wrong direction and now this- even further backwards. The other albums released lately, ""Live in Chicago"" and ""Listener Supported"", were nothing too special with typical jams to songs we've already heard.Dave Matthews is an unbelievable musician, but needs to take to time to record a new sound (Or head back to the old sound which made him popular).In addition, I play the guitar and the songs on ""Busted Stuff"" are not complicated what-so-ever! Not too fun to cover."
4,Decent,"This cd was good, but it couldn't match up to what they did in Everyday. Very good, though a must have for a collection."
3,Done Better,This Dave Mathews Band's c.d. was far beneath all of their other c.d.'s that they have produced.
2,Very disappointing!,"Compared to the Lillywhite Sessions, Busted Stuff is a letdown. The darkness and passion is missing, replaced with a lighter more commercial tone that undercuts the lyrical content. The raw confessional tone is muted on Busted Stuff in favor of less depressing but also less intimate one. The reworked versions oddly are less catchy and more bland than the originals. For example, the reworked lyrics of Big Eyed Fish seemed jammed in, ruining the flow of the song. The only new version on Busted Stuff that almost improves upon the Lillywhite Sessions is Raven. The lyrics, while changed, are actually intelligible. I just wish they had stayed true to the spirit of the LWS and not fiddled with what was one their best recordings."
3,Lillywhite revisited,"Busted Stuff is basically the abandoned Lillywhite sessions revisited. They were originally abandoned becuase the band felt the songs and music set too dark a tone. Personally, I preferred the Lillywhite versions of most, if not all, of the tracks. I don't find anything wrong with a darker, edgier, sound. And, in redoing the tracks with a lighter tone many of the pieces sound as if they are being shoe-horned into being something different from what they had been. I have the Lillywhite session tracks on a homemade CD from MP3's, and I fiond myself listening to it far more than to Busted Stuff."
5,Another great cd,"I have to admit I first heard most of these tracks from a cd a friend gave me called Lillywhite Sessions. Although a little rough, I loved the cd...much better than Everyday. I was excited when I learned that it was actually being released as Busted Stuff. I bought the cd and wasn't disappointed. Everything was polished up and sounds great. Grey Street, although overplayed on the radio, is a wonderful song. My personal favorites are Big Eyed Fish, Bartender, and Captain. I am now anxious to hear his solo album."
4,Sure its not the Lillywhite Sessions..........,but what is and what will ever be. This is becoming my favorite DMB album everytime I listen. It's not as musically lambasted as the previously albums have excelled at. The lyrics in this album exceeds that of all or at least comes close. I'm not going to go into a song by song review and analyze each of them. I just wanted to say that the day I bought this album which was the first I will never think of this grouop differently.
2,A Very Low Point for Dave,"Having been a fan of DMB way before their commercial success, going to their field concerts in Charlottesville, VA in the early 90s, I can say that this album is a very low point for Dave. His best works in the past have seemed intensely inspired and uplifting. ""Busted"" is a perfect title for this watered-down collection of songs that leaves much to be desired for a long-time DMB fan. There was such a special feeling of togetherness on his debut album, ""Remember Two Things"", live performances on the ""Recently"" EP, and others. ""Busted"" sounds like an uninspired jam-session in which Dave is performing for record executives, not the spirit of his fans or his inner self."
1,Worst Dave CD to Date,"Wow...too think that I once considered myself to be a Dave fan. He has gone downhill dramatically. Just when I thought that his studio recordings couldnt get any worse after Everday...he surprised me and came out with busted stuff. A true lackluster performance and a pitiful attempt at brining ""lillywhite sessions"" to the mainstream. Lillywhite Sessions was a very good cd, not his best, but good nevertheless. With Busted Stuff, he took many songs with good potential and slaughtered them. I guess i am not too surprised though...after all he is no being produced by the same guy who produces No Doubt and Alanis."
2,total disappointment,"for the millions of us who have been waiting for the Lillywhite sessions to get released (officially), this isn't what I was expecting. They have somehow managed to take 9 songs from the Lillywhite sessions, and suck out all of the emotion that made them great songs on the Lillywhite recording. Busted Stuff sounds nothing like the way these songs are performed in concert, and I am definitely glad about that! The two new songs are mediocre at best. By anyone else's standards, the two new songs are good tracks, but by the standards that dmb fans have been given the luxury of having, these songs are weak at best.Bottom line, this disc is incredibly weak. The producer butchered the levels on the instruments, and Dave's vocals were frequently flat and lacking emotion. Buy it if you are like me and buy absolutely everything they put out, but don't expect much, because this one doesn't deliver."
3,dm band by numbers,"dave and the band dumped this album because they thought it sounded like they where painting by numbers as it where and instead recorded the album everyday. while some of these songs are in my opinion up there with the best such as bartender, grey st., digging a ditch and big eyed fish overall i do agree with the band. there just dosen't seem to be that sparkle. don't get me wrong an average dm band album is still better than most of whats out there, but to these ears and with a good few years to listen everyday stands up to the passage of time better than busted stuff."
2,Mediocre effort that seems to be lacking the passion....(2.5 stars),"Dave Matthews Band has been one of my favorite bands over the past 10 years as I've played many of their CD's to death. I feel like their career has closesly modeled that of Pearl Jam's. Amazing first three albums with all their studio stuff afterward being sub-par compared to their earlier stuff. Also like Pearl Jam, DMB has revitalized their catalouge/discography with amazing live recordings of some of their best concerts.Unfortunately Busted Stuff falls into their ""later"" studio stuff. I really felt like the music was uninspired and not lively enough. Many say Busted Stuff represents a darker more serious DMB but this isn't the type of mood that best represents DMB. They are best when they are upbeat and jovial.Bottom Line: Fans of DMB probably already have this so its a moot point. Newcomers should try Crash, Before These Crowded Streets or Under the Table and Dreaming for the best DMB studio stuff."
1,MEDIOCRE at best,"There are two strong songs on this album: ""Where Are You Going"" and ""Bartender"". The rest of the album brings one phrase to mind: ""B-sides""."
2,Too long on the clock,"So here Dave Matthews has returned with the pre-Everyday songs that were so popular among the DMB nerds. To get right to the point and be frank; it doesn't live up to the hype. The songs lack texture, passion and interest. What the DMB have created here is a series of monotony. I guess true fans will find no fault here, but speaking musically, Dave most certianly didn't do it again. The high point of this album is ""Grey Street"" thus giving the record something to listen for, but there's no reason to let it play on further beyond that song. In my opinion, Dave Matthews' best days are behind him."
4,Everyday is DEAD! Long live the ol' DMB!,"This is what they should sound like. A great return to the organic sounds we all loved before Everyday tarnished the streak. It isn't as good as the first three albums, but I excuse the minor slip so long as the return to the original sound.Let's just hope they've heard the cries from the fans and keep away from Glen Ballard for all future releases."
3,Not impressed at all,"I am so dissapointed. Any of my friends would tell you that I'm probablay the biggest Dave fan they know ( pushing about 400 shows on CD and 15 concerts...and so forth) and let me tell you, STICK TO THE LIVE VERSIONS!!! Trade shows and get live versions (they're very good these days). They WHOOP this CD. The songs are amazing live (especially the Kit Kat Jam with lyrics, Captain, You Never Know, Grey St.) I don't know what happened on this album but maybe it's the fact that they tried to fill in the gaps with more of THEM. well, instead of doubling Dave's vocals, how about Carter or Boyd like on Crash nd UTTAD. and instead of trying to get other stuff in there, get TIMMY BACK!!!!! I dunno what's happening on these albums....best picks on the CD, BEAUTIFUL Grace is Gone and tight new parts to Grey St. That's about it guys..."
5,A new mix for old material,"Busted stuff is great, and it won't disappoint. The band sounds great as it plays through its old setlist from the Lillywhite Sessions. New singles like ""Where Are You Going?"" and ""You Never Know"" are welcome additions this great CD. Busted Stuff is also a landmark because it is the very first CD in which the band plays unaccompanied by any musical guests. Go DMB!!!"
5,Real Good Rocky Road,"A vast improvement over the inconsistent, overly shiny ""Everyday"" cd the Virginia jammers put out a while back. Moody and melancholy and some of the bootleg Lillywhite Session songs in a more complete format. This is a very good, honest, and sweet sounding disc. Keynote digged (really digged) the DVD features which are a minor bonus to say the least. Overall, I love it and will keep it away from the microwave. DMB's best album. Catch the vibe."
3,"""Lillywhite"" was much better","With the help of a fellow DMB fan, I managed to acquire the ""Lillywhite"" session bootleg well in advance of ""Busted Stuff"". While I like the songs on ""Busted"", I must admit I LOVE the original versions. I have listened to ""Busted"" only a few times since purchasing and find myself reaching for my bootleg copy instead."
2,Bland Adult Alternative,"I really, really want to like Dave Matthews. By all accounts he is an artist that should appeal to me. But I really find DMB to be so bland and devoid of any melody, texture or color. This album really epitomizes that. I know, I know- it's just me. There's got to be something here that I'm missing. I'm willing to keep trying, because I think there is something of substance here, even if I haven't found it yet. But in the meantime there's so much more good music being made."
1,Look who's back again,"Too bad. I mean, too bad that Dave Matthews has to live with the fact that he keeps re-writing the same song to infinity. Too bad millions have fans have resigned themselves to thinking this stuff is the best music on the market. Too bad that these fans spend their hard earned money on concerts and t-shirts and albums and posters, etc.The fact is that DMB has tricked millions of people into living and dying with its every move. They're not doing anything different than what CSN or Simon and Garfunkel or Grateful Dead or Carlos Santana or Graham Parsons or the Byrds have done before them: folky/poppy acoustic guitar tunes with a sometimes lysergic edge. The only difference? The bands listed above were actually good."
2,Busted Songs.,"After two particularly challenging and inventive albums, the DMB return with a collection of songs that they scrapped in late 2000 before collaborating with Glen Ballard on the far more exciting Everyday. These songs should have stayed in the trash. Rife with vague spiritual references that insult the listener and will surely have college potheads for years going, ""You know Dave Matthews is a Christian, right?"", the lyrics are an unrewarding mess, and the music is bland and completely under-produced. The bright shining moment, ""Gray Street"", would probably be a weak spot on any other DMB release, though that song together with ""Where are You Going"" may be worth the money if you find this album used."
2,Busted Stuff,"If you want to get all depressed then you should buy this album. I am a great DMN fan and have been to see them twice, but I am very disappointed in this album. I would describe it as elevator music for the tragically sad. Get a bottle of vodka before you listen to this one."
3,THIS IS NOT DAVE,"When i first heard DMB i really felt a wonderful feeling. I don't know why this artist is not considered in Italy,for me he was a real talent ,he had a unique sense of melody. BUT IN THE LAST YEARS AFTER EVERYDAY,IT'S CLEAR HE HAS LOST HIS MAGIC INSPIRATION. BUSTED STUFF CONTINUES WHERE EVERYDAY STOPPED"
2,the greek,"busted ""lillywhite"" should be the REAL name of this album, as these tunes were originally ""thrown out"" when dave met steve ballard and ""everyday"" became the new album instead of this stuff...now, granted, it has been re-worked and re-written, real dave fans will probably like the original versions best, and you can only get it by downloading it from morpheus or kazaa..the bonus dvd is WAY cool, as is the xtra stuff you can access from your computer!! definitly a must for any TRUE fan....**** out of 5"
1,pitiful,"This album gets lumped in with Everyday and Before These Crowded Streets as horrific albums at best. Yes, I said Before These Crowded Streets. That was a miserable album that needed editing in every way shape and form. BTCS was marred by never ending songs and unconvincing melodies. This marked the decline of Daves songwriting ability. Things have only gotten worse. Of course, he will always be incredibly talented and can live and tour off his only 2 good albums: UTAB and Crash. Yes, he only has 2 good albums (you cant include live albums). Face it folks, its over for our man Dave. Talented beyond belief, yes but he has lost it and once a band or artist loses it, they rarely recover. He'll have legions of fans buying new release after new release for years to come just hoping / praying for a bit of the old magic but I can assure you, it is gone."
4,Big sigh of relief,"Just picked up this album, and I was immediately relieved to hear a return to form for these guys; after the utter tripe that went into Everyday (Our love is SOOO RIIIIIGGGHT...ugh), I was afraid it was over. But Busted Stuff is a return to the instrumental and lyrical genius that made their earlier work what it was. It's refreshingly honest, after the cold, strained effort of the last album, and a big relief. Buy it for Kit Kat Jam, if for no other reason!"
5,Awesome!,"This cd rocks, i highly reccomend it to anyone. Kit Kat Jam is one of the best ones on here besides Where are you going. GO BUY IT!"
4,Seems like the stuff is busted,"Ok, I was a little disappointed in the album. While there are a lot of great songs, I have been spoiled by hearing them all live. Of course the DMB always put out stuff that is better live.Yet, the greatest thing about this album is that it isn't taylor made to the radio. Where Are You Going? seems to be the only song destined for that audience. However, some of the best songs on this album display DMB at its finest. Grace is Gone is an awesome song, one of the best on the CD, and I have always been partial to Bartender. Unfortunately, I am more of a fan of what they do live with that song. This is what makes the extra DVD great.Overall, this is probably one of the best studio albums DMB has put out, even if they really didn't want to."
5,Dave can do no wrong!,I just think that this album like all the rest is very original and very easy to listen to. Every song has a different theme and that's one thing i love about Dave. He never lets me down!!
2,Not sure what to think,"I have to admit I'm a big Dave fan, and I love pretty much everything he puts out, but I'm not very impressed with this one for one main reason---the songs all sound the same! I've always been impressed with the way he can make a whole album, a fantastic one, and all the songs sound completely different, yet all good, much like what the beatles could do. The basic sound he has going on the album is good, but it's too constant, I need variation. Either way, Dave is brilliant and I'm sure will continue to floor us with his brilliance, and his loyal fans are willing to look past a couple of flukes every once and awhile. Love ya Dave."
5,AWSOME!,"I have listened to both the Lillywhite Sessions and Busted Stuff. I have to say that Busted Stuff is better than the Lillywhite Sessions. Alot of people think that LWS are better but I have to disagree because in BS everything is touched up and sounds so much better. I think this album is just awsome, Bartender is just a great song, musically and lyrically. Bartender better win every single award possible because I don't think any other band can out perform it."
4,Awesome!,"This is a very cool CD! It shows a lot of maturity in the group, it is amazing. But it was not as good as some of the others, such as Crash, but still amazing! It is worth the money, and very cheap considering the DVD that comes with it. A fun band, a fun CD."
5,Its The Good Stuff,"Dave Mathews Band (DMB) goes back to their roots with their release of ""Busted Stuff"". While in there last CD was full of loud, noisy in your face electric guitar forcing the violin and the sax to stay in the background ""Busted Stuff"" goes back to their traditional style of just jamming with plenty of all the instruments. This CD includes some reworked songs from ""The Lillywhite Sessions"" an unreleased CD from DMB that leaked out onto the internet shortly after ""Everyday"". The songs are fabulous! All the songs are great and I never get tired of any of them! Buy this CD ASAP!... Some great tracks are Bartender, Busted Stuff, Big Eyed Fish, Grey Street, and Digging A Ditch!... Buy this CD NOW!!!"
2,"Better than ""Everyday"" at least","I've been a big man of Dave more many years now. Concerts and cd's have become a must. While I'm happy with ""Busted Stuff"" compared to ""Everyday"", which i wanted to burn, this cd still isn't as good as ""The Lillywhite Sessions"" disk. Many of the songs are the same, but the versions on the Lillywhite cd are ten times better. You'd be better off downloading that cd for free than spending money on this. But, if you do want this, you'll at least have to satisfaction of knowing that you're buying a much better cd than ""Everyday"", which made me lose some respect for Dave."
3,"Not the best, but worth listening to","I have anticipated this album since it was scheduled for release last year, and was so excited when I learned that it was finally coming out. I bought it yesterday, and have listened to it several times through. It is definitely a must-have for serious DMB fans, mainly because of songs like ""Grey Street,"" ""Bartender,"" and ""Grace is Gone,"" even though it doesn't include my favorite of the Lillywhite sessions, ""JTR.""However, if you are a first-time buyer of DMB's music, I would suggest a different CD...maybe ""Crash,"" or ""Before These Crowded Streets,"" just so you can get better acquainted with their sound.Overall, I would give this CD a rating of 3.5; it's not the best DMB CD in my opinion, but it is worth having because of the studio versions of the Lillywhite sessions."
2,"If It Ain't Busted, Don't Fix It","Had they not toyed with a good thing I'd have said this album should have been a 5-star recording, but I've had the internet rough cut for over a year and I must say the Lillywhite Sessions are far better than this re-recoreded effort. First off, many of the lyrics have been changed (Grey Street, Big Eyed Fish) or dropped (Kit Kat Jam), which lessens the brooding quality that pervades the Lillywhite version. Also, some of the tracks have been dropped; most notably the rocking sax-charged JTR and driving Sweet Up & Down. Only Digging A Ditch and Bartender seem to have escaped unscathed and appear here almost identical to their Lillywhite predecessors. Sure the sound quality is better on the Busted Stuff album, but the intense mood of uncertainty, longing and regret that pervades Lillywhite has been lost in the name of unnecessary revisionism. I'll stick to my net copy--thanks anyways."
4,Lillywhite Sessions redone,First off the only reason I'm not throwing out 5 stars is because I personally enjoyed the more dark/moody tone of the Lillywhite sessions..It is just a good look at Dave during what may have been some dark times...Fans of Dave know of the defunct Lillywhite Sessions that were never released publically but leaked through the Internet...Well this is the actual released CD with a more upbeat tone to great Dave songs...People that have seen a few of DMB tours or Dave and Tim will recognize most of these songs from live performaces...I recommend this CD to any Dave fan...
4,BUSTED STUFF,"Great release for the Dave Matthews Band. 9 songs have been re-worked from LillyWhite Sessions, but I am not too sure which songs are better. You never know and Where are you going are the newest on the album with You never know being my favorite. Grey Street, Captain, Bartender, Kit Kat Jam, and Raven are Incredible. The rest are average, but still awesome! If you are a heavy DMB fan you will find some torn feelings on this new Release but still an album for the collection!"
1,I don't like this album,"What's wrong with the really good pop that they did on Everyday? I don't understand why they have to throw in jazz and dark stuff onto their albums. The saxophone player sounds grittier, and I liked it more on Everyday when he sounded closer to really good saxs players like Kenny G. Also, where's all that electric guitar? It's just missing. It's as though they made this album so that people could smoke marijuana while listening to it. Last, the lyrics are bad. Songs like ""I Did It"" from Everyday have much better lyrics.I just don't like this album."
2,Boring!,"I Am not a DMB fand or will I ever be. The lead singer is boring, has annoying voice, cliched lyrics and the same songs all the way through. The rest of the band whoever they are seem to do their best out of weak material. They don't explore new territories or try new things. This is a tipical album for young girls to pick up and sing a long to thinking that this is the best thing ever. Boring and trite. The only reason why i give this 2 stars is because it has couple of allrigt songs and they do know how to play well."
1,Additional Busted,The case fell apart when opened & the additional busted CD would not play in player. It would error out and then be ejected.
2,What is this disgrace?,"I must say as a huge dave fan I am greatly dissapointed with this rework on Lillywhite. It was like the energy was sucked out of the original and locked away in a dark room. Captain, which is an incredibly dark and mysterious song on the original, now sounds like something that would be played on an easy listening station. The one redeeming song is ""grace is gone,"" which was sweetened up a bit from the original. Dave, I support you buddy, but this seems like a sorry way to make a few dollars, I sure hope Steve Lillywhite gets a piece."
5,Back to Being Dave,"DMB fans will not be disappointed. Excellent vocals, poignant lyrics, plus every member of the band gets to flex their creativity without rambling too far off the path. I like Busted Stuff much more than ""Everyday"" -- Dave is much better being Dave -- he does not need the slick production, i.e. Glen Ballard. Ear Candy For Sure."
3,Rusted Stuff,"Maybe it's because they've done these songs before, but Dave and the boys seem bored on this one. Maybe RCA made them put out a reworked Lillywhite Sessions to cash in on the public fervor for these songs. Maybe it's the producer. Whatever the reason, this CD is dull and lifeless. It lacks the soul and sonic spaciousness that Lillywhite had a knack for capturing. Even Glen Ballard who was much maligned for his antiseptic and polished stainless production of Everyday, got more life out of the band. It's not all bad. The reworked ""Bartender"" is quite good and I like it better than the original. ""Where Are You Going"" is a nice song as well and could have easily fit on any DMB album. As for the rest, well let's just say those songs have seen better days. The Lillywhite Sessions may have been raw and unfinished, but it had the shine of a diamond. This one lacks that shine like so much rusted stuff."
4,Busted,"I loved Busted and this album is brilliant, it has some of the best song on it. Would recommend giving this a listen. Loved it."
5,This year's Best Album,"the MATTHEWS BAND is back with this years best album hands down. BUSTED STUFF brings old DMB fans back to what they remember with previous DMB albums minus EVERYDAY and also uses the same pop formulas that worked so well on EVERYDAY to polish these tunes, making it DMB's best studio release to date. As for the songs, everyone is great on its own. However, this album has probably the best ending ever to an album starting with track 10. BIG EYED FISH --> (going into) 11. BARTENDER. This is the album that showcases the whole bands talent and captures the live feel of their music the best, but see for yourself how good this album is."
3,an improvement over Everyday,"Everyday was a sad album for me. Dave Matthews Band had changed. The magic of Under the Table was not present, i never got a tingle like I did from Lie in Our Graves on Crash. The LIlywhite Sessions signaled that the ability to be like the old BMB was still there--they still had the ability to create music that would sned a tingle down your spine. Busted Stuff is a victory when viewed as more similar to the ""glory days."" If, for nothing else, this album is worth purchasing for the 5.1 edition of Bartender on the DVD. That is stunning."
2,eh,"I like Dave Matthews but this CD all sounds the same to me. After one or two songs, I found myself tuning it out completely. I suppose that's a good thing if you like bland background music, but I was hoping for something more. It's not that I dislike individual pieces, but on the whole, I think I'll try to sell my copy."
3,The Better Album?,"They say Dave doesn't like this album but, many of his long time fans weren't too thrilled about ""Everyday"". The tone here is downbeat and the songwriting lacks inspiration at times. But.... by comparison, this sounds much more like a Dave Matthew's ""Band"" album as opposed to the ""solo"" album that ""Everyday"" essentially was.""Everyday"" sold well because quite frankly, anything Dave put out at that point would have. However, Glen Ballard was a definite mis-match for Dave and it's good to hear Steve Lillywhite's more complimentary touches return on this album.Those comparisons aside, I, for one, am still waiting for the worthy follow up to ""Before These Croweded Streets"". I think Dave, despite the groundswell in popularity, is in a bit of a creative rut and I look forward to his return."
3,"For septic tanks, ---NOT","I just had my septic tank cleaned. The man that did it asked what kind of toilet paper we used and before I could answer he told me, Scott! He recommends we only use Angel Soft as it will truly discintgrate in the tank whereas most of the well known brands don't break down enough."
2,"Just OK, there are better paper towels","These towels are thin and rough, and they do not tear easily. Each roll is small, which means we were always running out. They are also not individually packaged (liable to get dusty while in storage). Kirkland brand paper towels are much better and a good value."
2,Not all that good,These paper towels don't rip evenly. They never tare off correctly. They are very thin compared to what I am used to and are not very soft. They are cheap and I guess you get what you pay for
2,disappointing quantity,"Somehow I thought I was getting more. And these are single ply, which means that you must use more of the product for the same results. I would not buy the product again."
2,not bad for sand paper,"they are ok and just OK!They are a bit to stiff, rough and not great at absorbing!I would recommend Viva Paper Towels"
4,"Amazing product, but only comes in purple...","The product is amazingly small and works perfect so far. The 4 Gig micro vault tiny only comes in purple, even though the amazon picture looks blue. And the carrying case reminds me of some hello kitty accessory. I'd prefer something less toy-like, and not only available with a light purple, rubber (hello kitty) carrying case. It seems as if it could slip out easily of this case, but it just doesn't. I've carried it on my keys and it has not come loose or fallen out at all. Other than the color and toy-like case, it's an awesome product."
4,Nice colors,"For the mom, these are perfect. They go on easily & come off easily. For a child, it's a little disappointing because they want the tattoo to remain on their arm/leg/belly/face/any other weird spot they can find until they run out of spaces for more tattoos.I like the fact that a little Ivory soap and a washcloth get these off without irritating my toddler's skin.The colors are amazing! If your child is studying butterflies, these are very realistic."
4,Grandaughter Loves Them!,I bought these as a filler for an order and I'm glad I did! They are easy to apply and last several days. My 4 year old granddaughter loves them!
4,These are small but beautiful,I got these for an adult friend for a stocking stuffer this Christmas. They look very intricate and beautiful. We both love butterflies but would never get a tattoo. I got one for me also. For the kid in us just a fun little thing to do.Safe way to just have fun for kids or adults.
4,Belgian's strangest filmmaker at his best,"Though I saw this movie several years ago, I remember it as being very shocking yet very amusing too. For those who don't mind vulgar comedy,big breasts,Lola Ferrari's, then I'm sure you'll have a great time watching this little piece of Belgian summer."
3,I like Jane Asher,"Look I am an old Beatles fan--I remember when Jane was engaged to Paul and starring in ALFIE and not cooking cakes or writing potboilers. And I like ""horror"" movies. So it was a win win for me. Seriously it is a good flick."
2,slow and pointless,a slow british horror a bit tootalky and not much on scares . good premise not well executed . jane asher after mc cartney dumped her .
3,while you were down there,i don't know where you guys got your cd.i got the zoom club rerelease and the recording isn't that bad.i personally think the first stray dog album is the best.
4,As good as you'll get,"After cherishing the original LP of this classic, I was a little disappointed with the quality and ""live/ unreleased versions"" of songs on this CD, but then I got to ""Worldwinds"" and from then on the music hit it's stride and the original magic of the creative guitars, piano and synthesizers in perfect harmony made it come alive close to the original Texas-style masterpiece. This is some of the most creative and diverse songwriting in the history of southern rock, if not rock in general. If only it had modern-day production quality, it would be as hipnotizing when played at maximum decibels as some of us remember it.It's still a great listen, and a very moving piece of work."
5,Emptiness,"This book is up there with Eckhart Tolle's books; Adyashanti is a poet and a clear channel for anyone who wants enlightenment, rather than mind trip city! It is an amazing book!"
5,As close to the truth as words can go,"This is the MUST read for anyone drawn to what is ""truly"" true. This is the path of unknowing, of finally relinquishing one's personal story utterly. This is the guide."
3,"Good theory, poorly written","I really like the whole idea that is the basis of the book, but the writing is very poor. I am only partially through, and reading slowly because it is a bit agonizing getting through the writing. I would like to tell the author to cut to the chase and ask that he be more clear in the point that he is trying to make. Too much dance, not enough action. There are only so many ways to say the same thing and the author makes every effort to use them all. 'A' for effort. I intend to complete the book, and have hope that as I make my way through that there will be improvement."
4,Wide Chunky-Heeled Shoes,"These shoes run wide. I wouldn't have purchased if I had tried them on first.LIKES:The shape of the chunky-heel is stylishThey are more comfortable than other 5-inch heels I ownDISLIKES:My toes keep sliding out! It is really annoying to keep adjusting my feetNot as cute as I'd hoped (The front opening is too wide. From the front, it makes them look more like sandals instead of sexy dress shoes)I am going to try adding shoe gel pads as one of the other reviewers suggested, so hopefully that will help with the fit."
5,Haunted Gold,"This is a movie that the family will want to gather around the t.v., with popcorn in hand, to watch. From the title page with bats flying towards you, to the eyes mysteriously watching from behind pictures and clocks. John Wayne rides into the ""ghost town"" to claim his share of a closed gold mine, only to find villians and mysterious characters running around town. Of course there is a female he is sure to fall in love with. With the help of his workhand, Clarence and his horse, Duke, John Wayne rounds up the bad guys and gets the girl. The horse, Duke, does some really impressive stunts. This movie is great for anyone who loves a good movie, one you'll watch over and over."
2,Average B western,"I found myself bored with this as I do with all of Dukes earlier works. Fun to watch once but I never feel the need to repeat viewings. Haunted Gold is an average B western with the same substandard script and poor acting, but the action is very good. As for the earlier Duke films, if you're looking for quality westerns, I HIGHLY recommend the following: Helltown(Dukes best early performance), The Big Trail(Absolutley a grand spectacle in early filmmaking and the first widescreen movie)and Angel and the Badman(good script)."
3,The Duke's Weird Western,"One of John Wayne's earliest starring vehicles, ""Haunted Gold"" (1932) is a lively genre-bending Western produced by Leon Schlesinger in a departure from his Warner Bros. cartoon output. Mixing ""old dark house"" chills with hard-riding thrills, the hour-long programmer utilizes stock footage from Ken Maynard's ""The Phantom City"" (1928). Politically incorrect to the extreme, but good fun as the Duke develops his screen persona. ""B"" Westerns rarely look this sharp in terms of video quality."
3,Decent,"This movie is a lot better than I thought it would be. Really, since it's only an hour long, why not watch it? A word of warning, though: it's really dark, so I had to turn all the lights out just to see the picture decently enough."
5,Understanding your Bible,"This is the best choice for a study Bible on the market. It not only has Pastor Parsley's notes, but also lists historical info and points of interest. A must have!"
1,"Actuallly a very good movie, but...","the picture and sound quality are horrible. I have VHS tapes that have ten times the quality of this. Unless you really love this movie, I'd recommend against it. The movie I would give 4 stars to. I give one star for this horrible horrible transfer."
1,Serviceable remake; dreadful transfer,"The original ""Arch of Triumph"" is in all respects better, but this was an honorable attempt at a remake, and I'd give it 3.5 stars but for the staggeringly poor quality of this DVD version. I have seen home transfers of videotapes to digital media that have looked and sounded better than this. The film deserved better, and so does the customer."
1,Huge disappointment!,"The plot is slow and dull, even Anthony Hopkins can't bring it to life. Additionally the quality of the DVD is unbelievably poor. I can't believe any company would produce a DVD that looks and sounds as bad as this one."
5,Perfect Bedtime Story,I read this story to my 2 small children every night before bedtime. They LOVE it!
4,Great Cd,"Blaster the Rocketman is a awesome cd. I have heard all their cd's in the past and i loved each one of them. They combine punk and hardcore in an awsome way and the music lirics are punkish with a hardcore twist. I recomend this cd if you are interested in finding Christian music that is different contemporary or stuff like that. So if you like hardcore, punk, or Godcore than this is definatly a Cd that you should get!"
3,Useful but heavy read,"This was one of the first books in the series I read of my own accord, and I've revisited it several times since. I bought it mainly because as a teacher of English in the Czech Republic, one of the main difficulties of my learners is the use of the definite and indefinite articles. It's certainly a challenge to read, but very informative. I find the first part, where Lyons discusses traditional approaches to definiteness, like familiarity, identifiability, uniqueness and inclusiveness, particularly useful, as it sharpens one's perception of the elements of definiteness. Another useful realisation that I got from this book was that definiteness is not restricted to definite articles or affixes, but can also be found in other parts of the language system, which made it easier for me to explain it to my students through finding counterparts in their own language."
4,Pretty Good Book,"This is a good book, but beginners may find it frustrating that the plants are listed throughout the book by their scientific names and common names are not listed anywhere but the index. It's also pretty small, but I'm glad I got the book; it has helped several times for houseplant issues. I bought it used; can't beat the price!"
3,It Didn't Happen Overnight,"I was born in Dayton, Ohio and lived there for thirty-eight years. Many of my peers figured they didn't have to graduate from high school and go to college because the factory jobs would always be there for them. Well, guess what ...My cousin was a union factory worker in Dayton and he made sure both of his sons got a college education."
3,THE STARTER,"SWAMI RAMA is,was,and always will be a Guru for all of us,chelas or not.If you are starting in yoga,or in Swami Rama,this is the first book to read ! Divine for starters ! I put three stars only because it was material known ( most of it) to me,and because I would not know what to put to the other Sw.Rama's books..."
3,"Good toy, disappointed with condition","I ordered this toy through Amazon as I don't believe Discovery is making it anymore. The toy was in good condition, but all the supply bottles had leaked all over making it unusable. Supplier should really have checked this before reselling."
1,The simple facts.,"Jonathan Sarfati makes many assertions in his book, but he and his readers should consider the following.Sarfati's theological claims are not considered to be correct by the majority of evangelical Christian scholars and theologians.Sarfati's scientific claims are viewed as absurd by the entire scientific community, many of whom are themselves evangelical Christians. Could it be that if the large majority of educated evangelical Christians disagree with Sarfati, then maybe, just maybe he might be wrong? I suggest that if you are honestly seeking truth, then compare his arguments with those of Dr Hugh Ross (the topic of Sarfati's book) and please MAKE UP YOUR OWN MIND IN WHICH DIRECTION THE EVIDENCE POINTS. A good starting point would be to get the soon to be released ""A Matter of Days"" by Dr Ross."
5,A must read!!!,"If you are a progressive creationist or perhaps you know one? then this is the book to read. Dr. Sarfati's research is in depth, his writing style speaks to all ages and education levels and he is methodical in his approach to refuting these ridiculous claims. One warning though - don't read late at night, this book is hard to put down and your sleep will suffer."
1,Division instead of unity,"In an age where Christianity is under constant attack from those outside the church, one has to ponder the wisdom of one group of Christians attacking another, especially when the issue of the age of the earth has no bearing on the issue of salvation. Hostility within Christianity only serves to drive the undecided away from Christ and the church.If you are going to read this book, then, please also read Hugh Ross's books ""Creation and Time"" and his upcomming book ""A Matter of Days."" Other books that present multiple views on creation in a single volume, and do so in a civilized manner, are ""Three Views on Creation and Evolution"" and ""The Genesis Debate."""
5,Success God's Way.,This book bring the prosperty message into balance. It has made a life changing difference in my life. This is a must reading for all Christians. It makes so-o-o much sense! Dr. Stanley gives the Scriptures to back up what he is saying. Read it without religious traditions and preconcieved ideas.
5,A Collection of 3 Classics!,"This video is a collection of 3 classics! First,in The Butter Battle Book(1989),the Zooks and the Yooks are at battle between the butter and bread.Who will win? That is the question.Next,in Daisy Head Mayzie(1993),a daisy sprouts outta Mayzie's hair!Then,a man comes to make Mayzie famous.Mayzie signs her name on the contract that man had.Then,daisy-head fever sweeps the nation!Then,she has tons of money in her lucky money house.""She had all her money stacked up in tens,but what would she honey without all your friends? She had found her dream and lost her way. That was the price she just coulden't pay."" C'mon,you know the story.Finally,in In Search of Dr. Seuss(1990),this is the video version of Dr. Seuss' #1 New York Times bestseller Dr.Seuss:The Biography.This video is for Dr.Seuss freaks,maniacs,and fans alike! If you love Dr.Seuss,then this is for ya!"
1,USELESS!,"This is a reprint of a pamphlet (30 to 50 some pages, depending on reproduced format) published in 1906. The first part of the pamhplet is 1900's preaching and moralizing. It compares world religions - all of which (called ""fancies"") loose when compared to Christianity. The second part of the pamphlet is a list in calendar form of the daily religious holidays/celebrations and observances in 1900's China."
4,"1,000 count sheets",These are my first sheets of this high thread count. I must say that they feel as if they will last a lifetime. They are really soft and wash well although when they come out of the dryer they are more wrinkled than others of lesser thread count.I would buy these sheets again if I could find them at the $60.00 price.
3,Very stiff,I can't say they are poorly made sheets as they are. They are so heavy and stiff. I thought being 1000 count they would be much softer. They remind me of line dried sheets which some people like. Maybe after several washings they will get softer.
2,100- thread count sheets,there is no way these sheets have that thread count. I have lower thread count sheets that are softer. Also the flat sheet and fitted sheet are two different colors!
4,Nice Sheets,"This is my fourth set of 1000+ Thread-Count Sheets and I have to say they are the most stiff pair I have. Eventhough they are stiff I expect them to soften up over time (as the others have). Also, I correlate the ""stiff-ness"" to such high thread count, if you want something super pliable buy a lower TC."
5,These sheets ROCK!,I love these sheets - they are so thick and comfy!! It is true that they get softer after each wash. My husband wasn't a fan at first but after only two washes he's sold too. They also do wrinkle but they are easy to fluff and who actually cares? They flatten out easily when you put them on the bed. The other thing that I love about these sheets is that they are very deep. I'm sure they would fit on any mattress!
4,Great Product,"I bought these when they were on sale for $59.99. These are great sheets. However, couple of things to note: 1. They smell like chemicals when you receive them (takes a few washings for the smell to go away); 2. They are very hard when you first receive them (takes about 5 washings for them to start to soften up). If you can put up with those two things for the first few washings, you will really like these sheets. I love how they feel now (I've had them about two months, wash them once a week, and put them right back on). These are my favorite sheets that I own (I have several sets from other manufacturers). I have a feeling that they will last a long time."
1,I expected more from these sheets,"I picked up these sheets during a Friday Sale ($69.99). I am pretty disappointed by the overall feel of these sheets. Out of the packaging they were stiff and rough. I ran them through a wash w/fabric softener, and they weren't any better. They seem to be constructed well (the seems are high quality) They feel like 180-200tc hospital sheets. I've bought 800tc sheets for <$100 and they were night and day better. Don't waste your time on these sheets, they aren't worth the money."
3,I hope they continue to get softer,"I washed these sheets the day I got them in cold water as directed. Tossed them in the dryer on low/delicate cycle (as directed) and they came out a wrinkle mess! They were very uncomfortable and scratchy to say the least. I have continued to wash them (but in HOT water and used fabric softener) and they are getting a little softer each time. I only hope they become my favorite sheets, but right now they are not. But I am hopeful with each washing they will improve."
2,"If you buy these, buy white","Washed in cold water as per the label, the color ran and ran BADLY. Other than the spotty color, I like these sheets a lot for the price, but I really wish now that I had bought white instead of ivory."
1,you get what you pay for,"We purchased the king size ivory sheets for our bed. These sheets are not quite as rough as other have describe. Not the softest but not the worst either. WE bought them as a gold box item for $64. Well you definitely get what you pay for. We have had these sheets about a month or so now and they are already wearing out after just one wash. The places on the pillow cases and sheets where your body rubs the most, is starting to get quite rough."
5,Pike Street 1000-ct sheets,"Sheets are great. the ivory color is a little more yellow than white, but not too bad. Some people have complained about the stiffness of these sheets(here, not at my house), but I happen to like it. They feel starched, but not scratchy. Again, I like the feel of them. No other issues with these sheets at all."
1,What a Raving Piece of S!!!!!!!!!!!,Its no wonder this piece of CRAP band is no longer with us. They probably could not stand the stench of each others unoriginality. Particularly that of the vocalist & drummer. This is post grunge puke that has been done hundreds of times before and hundreds of times better. What made any of you pieces of S!!! think that a band of this unheard of LOW caliber would survive in a city with such a rich musical history. Hope you all died in a SUV crash on your way to your last gig.
4,"Great songs, so so sound and price too high.","I bought this album back in the day on vinyl. I loved it, so now I'm replacing a lot of my old vinyl albums with CD's. After listening to Stray Dog I remember why I loved it so much back then. It seems there is a little too much bass on some of the songs, but it is possible it was bassy back then too, I just don't recall.I think I paid too much for this CD, but it is an import and I haven't been able to find it anywhere else, so what is a guy to do if you want it bad enough. Never let be said I stole songs by downloading them, I pay for my music!!Anyway, it is a great album and the sound is good enough to enjoy, so I don't regret it at all. Now I can work on purchasing some of my other oldies but goodies!!"
4,"Make time for ""No Time for Pilots""","""No Time for Pilots"" by James McMillen Owen depicts military life like it really was in the 60's and 70's. Military people and their spouses will relate closely to the comedy and tragedy of military life. This may be a novel, but Owen's descriptions of incidents and places are realistic. I remember well those 50 degree temperatures at Eielson AFB, Alaska and the shrimp boats at Biloxi, Miss. For those of us who are no longer involved in military life, this book will bring back vivid memories of the places we have been and the people we have met along the way. For those readers with a non-military background, this novel is an insight to military life. The author makes living in many different locations and traveling from base to base seem as exciting as it actually was. Owen's use of humor throughout the book is especially entertaining."
1,A Big Swindle!,"Anyone who pays money for this book gets as ripped off as the poor guy who wrote it. Slogging through this incredibly dull and trite blather, all I could think was how pathetic that this guy went through 6 years believing he was ""in analysis."" While this is supposed to be an account of an analysis, it was nothing but pretentious, narcissistic self-delusion from beginning to end."
4,"Pleasant enough tea, not sure if it helps with lactation...","OK, so I can't tell if it's making that much of a difference as far as milk production goes. I've done pretty well regardless, but have tried both this tea as well as the Traditional Medicine version and haven't noticed a difference between the two.I don't really have a reason to be paranoid, but I tried the teas to halp build up my freezer stopck of milk in case I have any issues with production and need a good supply of back-up. As a result I've tried the teas and brewers yeast pills. I didn't see a significant increase, but they have served as a security blanket of sorts for me :-)However, I wanted to put this review up because so many of the others talk about how tasty the Yogi version is. I just wanted to say that I think the Traditional Medicines and Yogi tea versions taste almost exactly the same, so go with whichever you find the best deal on!"
1,Doesn't work for me,"I switched from Organic Mother's Milk and used to pumped every morning after feeding. I was able to get over 3 oz. After switched, I could only hardly get 1 oz. I am switching back to Organic Mother's Milk."
2,not my fav,"i prefer traditional medicinals mothers milk tea. i think this yogi tea has a weird after-taste. but, it did do its job: increased my milk supply."
4,"Tasty, but...","I'm not sure if it helped my milk supply, I think so. I like the taste of this tea, but I think the Mother's Milk tea by Traditional Medicinals is better and I know that tea helped with my supply."
3,Not too crazy about it,I bought the tea because I was loosing my milk and someone told me that it worked for them. I guess it's not for everyone because it didn't do much for me.
2,Milk Supply Decreased????,"I have consumed two boxes of this and my milk supply has dramatically decreased! I am trying to isolate any other potential variables and will try to stick with it (since I have 4 boxes left!) but I am disappointed. Also, this has Anise in it so it you like black licorice you should enjoy the taste. I however strongly dislike black licorice and have a very difficult time drinking it. If my supply increases later I will come back and change this review otherwise this has been a waste of money and a bad tasting experiment.***Update, my review stayed. I will be throwing the last couple of boxes away. Not work my time or money. Too bad."
4,Tastes great!,"I just received my tea tonight. Smells like black licorice which I don't mind, the taste is considerable mild compared to the scent. Don't let it deter you from trying this tea! Of course it's too soon to evaluate how well it works for milk production but so far so good!"
4,mommy milk is the best,"i would say,compare to the MM brand giving the same supply BUT this one just too hard for me to drink.It taste horrible."
4,So far so good....,"I bought this tea based on the great reviews posted here on Amazon. It seems like this brand, with the addition of chamomile to it, was preferred for taste but otherwise has the same herbs as the other types out there. I just started drinking it today. I made a pot of tea and chilled it so I could drink it on my ride to work and then during the day at my desk since they recommend a total of 3 -4 servings a day. I actually like the taste (though I can imagine growing tired of it once I am drinking it for a few weeks at 4 times a day) and it works well as an iced tea. Now as for the results... I will have to wait and see."
4,Not a great taste but gets the job done,"I'm attempting to relactate and have been taking this along with Fenugreek daily. The tea isn't the best tasting, but I can stand it for the sake of my son. This, combined with Fenugreek, has begun to slowly up my supply. I seem to be producing a bit more milk, after going over a month without bf'ing. I also love the little mantras on each packet. They always make me smile and keep me motivated to keep trying to relactate for my son."
3,Okay,"I don't know if this does anything to help with milk production or not, but the taste is a little off for me. If you like black licorice, you'll love it. Otherwise, I suggest a lot of honey!"
2,Tastes REALLY bad.,I usually drink the Mothers Milk tea but thought I would give the Yogi tea a try. It did nothing for my supply and it tastes horrible. I got through 2 boxes and couldn't finish the last four. I have a strong stomach and can usually tolerate anything. The Mothers Milk tea at least makes a difference in my supply.
1,Tastes awful and not sure working,"Ok, so I admit, I've noticed that all teas promising to increase my milk supply taste nasty. So I don't think it's the teas fault. I think it's just the natural herbs that increase lactation don't taste good to me. I also can't notice a difference when I take it and when I don't. And when I do take it, I try to drink 3 cups of this stuff a day. Gross."
5,great price,Starting using this as a Breastfeeding support group and it works great. Tastes good too. Great price compared with other places i found.
3,Not sure if it really has an effect,"Taste is OK, herbal, but I cannot drink it straight all day long and usually mix with green tea. As for the milk production, while using it for half a year I have not noticed any significant increase. It might have some pacebo effect and the herbs listed are good for you anyway."
1,Didn't work for me,"I purchased Yogi because it was cheaper than Traditional Medicinals Mother's Milk. However, this brand for some reason did not help to increase my supply at all, even with drinking 4 cups a day. However, Traditional Medicinals seemed to increase my supply significantly. I would recommend only purchasing a case if you really know that this tea will work for you."
5,Wonderful tea!,I got this tea very quickly after I ordered and it was all in one peice when it got here!!
5,For the aspiring animator,"My son (4th grade) is fascinated by this collection of animation, and inspred to try different types himself. Absolutely magical, and, at least this time, a successful alternative to minecraft!"
2,ehhh,It's a neet gift idea for the person that has everything but after the last box arrived I realized that I paid a lot of money for salsa that is just Ok. I'm not sure where the Gourmet part comes in. I've had better from the Market.
2,Amateur Hour,"""The Ultimate Highlights of the Opera,"" sounds more like Amateur Hour. They're Balkan singers, primarily, from the Ljubljana, Slovenia area, and they're almost all second rate. These are brand new productions, stereo and modern; the wave of the future, since classical albums can no longer be produced economically ""in the west,"" except for certain superstars - of which these are definitely not. Among the included bombs, they slipped one old monophonic recording of Aureliano Pertile singing ""Una furtive lagrima."" What a pleasure to hear a real opera singer among all these ""others."" Except for the Pertile piece, I won't add any of these to my library. I will simply place the disk on a shelf somewhere and play it from time to time, to remind me of what record buyers are in for from now on."
1,Useless. Skip it.,"It is supposedly reef safe, but still stresses the coral in your tank, especially non-photosynthetics and SPS. Furthermore, after an entire two-week treatment cycle (per the instructions), no notable outcome was visible. The Ich was still present and I was still losing fish. Go ahead and skip this one..."
4,"Excellent information about ""the treatment of last resort.""","I picked up the book with a strong bia against ECT. The book addressed many of those biases and demonstrated that those biases were for the most part false. The book points out the fact that people fear what they do not understand, and ECT is much misunderstood.I recomend this book to anyone who's physician has suggested ECT as the best treatment available. One need not live with crippling depression, nor live with a baseless fear of an effective treatment."
3,Good Handbook,"Book is fine. Useful. It is ashame that folks with strong false beliefs badmouth the book and ECT. They are wrong. If my choice was for ECT or for taking a bunch of pills day after day I would go for ECT. James Staudenmeier, MD, MPH (Health Services Administration)"
2,Ban ECT,"This book is a manual for shock doctors. Shock therapy is a brain damaging, abusive, and humiliating proceedure that needs to be obliterated before the new millenium. There needs to be an alternative to ect, somehow!"
5,It's amazing!,"This is a most complete math practising guide, what I see. I think it is good enough for every people who like to practise math problems. The solution part is very helpful! Great! Please don't stop the development!"
4,ANOTHER EARLY STARRING ROLE FOR WAYNE,"I've always considered it very strange why Wayne's westerns of the 1930's are not given the same sort of revered status that other western stars like Hopalong Cassidy and Roy Rogers received. Sure they're B movies but so were the films by Cassidy and Rogers. They might not have been as good from a pure technical standpoint, but they weren't awful either.Wayne plays deputy Sheriff John Steele as he goes undercover as a drifter in New Mexico to find out who is behind the cattle rustling. Ruthless Land baron Sam Crew sends his Henchman Arizona Frank Bailey out to capture a herd of cattle being brought in by some new settlers. Steele joins the settlers and evenutally saves the say as Crew and Bailey are brought to justice. At just 55 minutes this is a very quick film but quite action packed and very well done. One of Wayne's strongest early roles. Nice supporting cast including Noah Beery as Crew."
4,It was a great movie.,"Can't believe how young John Wayne was in this film. His horse had the name ""Duke"". I thought that Mae Madison who played Ginger was very good. The stunts in the film were good too."
4,"Early Wayne Western Have Similar Traits, And That's Fine","A number of John Wayne's early westerns looked alike, but that's not a criticism because the handful I've seen were all entertaining. That includes this one.Many of them only were about an hour long, had interesting (albeit strange) dialog, had a pretty lead female (here, Mae Madison) and a very talented horse named ""Blue."" Of course, the men were all tough guys.There is a lot of action and interesting scenes packed into this one hour.My only complaint was that Luis Alberini's character made the Mexicans look unnecessarily stupid."
5,Absolutely luxurious!,"I use this product! It is absolute Heaven in a jar. The scent is amazing. Winter is approaching and so is dry skin. Don't be caught without a wonderful product to protect against the winter blues as well as dry, itchy skin. Go ahead and pamper yourself! You deserve it!"
3,Destiny in Space,The film is good and worth having to remind you of the wonder of space travel. Would not recommend watching it on a small screen TV with weak speakers because this movie is meant to be BIG.Without the size all you're left with is an above average documentary about space.
4,Very Good Documentaries!,"My husband and I loved watching these documentaries. However, my son, 5, faded in and out with its more mature teaching style. Great for older space enthusiasts. For my son, I wound up finding a musical adventure, ""My Fantastic Field Trip To The Planets,"" where the planets have faces (very effective for holding young kids' interests). Overall, I recommend this Imax Best of Space Collection, but for the little ones don't expect too much interest."
4,Good watching!,This is a good movie and appropriate for these times. Anne Margret and Julie Andrews do a great job of portraying mothers of sons who seem confused a bit but are still loyal to each other.
5,Battery works as expected,Battery fit and works as advertised in our RCA cancorder. Battery appeared identical to the original that was no longer holding a charge.
4,Practical guide to research/writing (and the arrows work),"Van Evera's book is simple, to be sure, but not simplistic; a prior reviewer's gibes at the notion of flow-charting a theory, with arrows, are a bit off the mark. As the reviewer notes, a theory designates a causal relationship. If so -- no matter what its other ""good"" points (parsimony, explanatory reach, etc) -- you can draw that causal relationship between the various independent variables and the dependent variable they help to explain. You can even draw it with arrows.In general this book is recommended for 1st or 2nd year political science graduate students, and useful for advanced undergraduates (who will only care about the 1st 100 pages or so). It is clear and eminently practical. Other reviewers are right to imply there is little here in the way of philosophy of science in the broadest sense. But that merely makes this book a complement, not a substitute, to more esoteric explorations of the topic."
4,A logical straightforward guide for graduate students,"Guide to Methods for Students of Political Science by Stephen Van Evera is a straightforward guide on the basic elements of producing quality graduate-level theories and papers that are required of that level of study. To some, the advice found in these pages may prove to be repetitious and common sense, but I personally found the sections on theories and case studies to be a highly useful tool to reinforce the core ideas of graduate level writing that grad students sometimes forget in their zeal over their research interests and meeting those deadlines. One drawback, is that it is geared towards graduate students who study international relations where the case study method is most prevalent. In other segments of the field, the large-n- method is empathized, meaning that other students using that method may need another book. Overall though, most students of political science should find something useful in this book."
3,Book for grad school,"I knew the book was slightly used, but it did not mention the amount of highlighting and underlining in the book. That being said, it is helpful to bring my attention to the important points...but the writing on the pages were not mentioned."
4,Where am I?,"This film based of the best selling book is probably the best book adaptation to a movie I have ever seen, sure it wasn't 100% spot-on (I had some issues with the ending scenes), BUT that being said the overall feel of the movie matched perfectly with the book and it did with the mastery of Japanese cinema (even though it is a Vietnamese director). While Rinko Kikuchi is the biggest name in this film (she was Babel and got nominated for an Academy Award for said movie, making her the second Japanese female to have that happen and the only living one) I think the male lead really steals show."
4,Norwegian Wood,"An interesting story although at times hard to follow, great scenery locations to the extent that I only watched it for the second time a couple of days ago but can not remember how it endedTony Green"
2,Norwegian Wood Film,"Okay seriously this is not that great of a movie. The characters were bland and unemotional. The overall mood of the movie was very creepy and at times awkward. In a nutshell the movie's plot is about horny sexually frustrated youth in their early 20s set in the 1960s. They never really explained the importance of the song ""Norwegian Wood"" in the movie although they did play it in the end credits.Plus the dvd that I received came with very bad English subtitles thus making the movie even more incomprehensible.Stick with the book and avoid this movie."
1,What I talk about when I talk about running by Haruki Murakami,"The product I received was a DVD. I ordered the book. I wanted a book. The order form did not clearly indicate that the product was a DVD. In fact, I'm sure it indicated that I was ordering a book. Time to make your order forms more specific and clearer. I don't want to be bothered with sending it back and all the additional hassle. I gave it away to someone who was interested in a DVD. I am not. Neither am I interested in Kindle books. In fact, I will try to find books elsewhere before I order from Amazon again. Thank you."
5,Worth Buying To Have As a Backup In an Emergency,"This is a sweet and useful little product that will give you emergency backup battery time. These are some of the actual results I've obtained:1.5 hours of actual use time with a PDA plugged in via the USB port.The Pocket Power doesn't like my Samsung SCH-U740 mobile phone, and won't work with it.1.5 hours of actual use time with a smart phone, also plugged in through the USB port.The product manufacturer's claims about six hours of charge time are, in my experience and opinion, greatly exaggerated. The product name ofPocket Power is also a bit misleading as this is actually a fat brick. However, it really has worked as advertised, and I have no complaints. You can also plug in electronic items that work with a standard US two-prong wall plug."
4,Small Towns as Lunatic Asylums,"Ms. Alther's humor has always delighted me, and this book is another worthy achievement of hers. Woman of the world Clea Shawn decides to give up her lovers and travels, and seeks peace in a small town in New Hampshire. She surprisingly does adapt to little Roches Ridge although she is now physically separated from her husband, teenage children, and her female best friend.While I enjoyed the book I did find the whole thing a bit unsettling. The two plot lines of the novel clashed a bit. The part of the story dealing with the outlandish citizens of Roches Ridge -and believe me there is not a normal person in the whole town- is quite hilarious. The other theme, Clea's relations with her family, and, most importantly, with her best friend Elke provide us with a more serious story. Either plot would have made a decent novel in itself.It's good Alther, though. Highly recommended."
4,This is a good read!!!,"After reading some of the other so called crime books out there like B-More Careful and True to The Game, it was nice to come across someone who was actually telling a good story. The characters were developed and the language was clear and not slang orientated so the average reader can understand what is happening without having to know hardcore street lingo. And the fact that it was set up in the 70's makes the story even more interesting. The central part of the book focuses on a father and his two sons and is written well. I hope to see more work from Tony M. Cheatham."
4,Better for Older Children,"This is a great product- good value when you buy the vehicles. But 3 is a little young. 4 would be better, and parts of it are durable or will be taken apart by younger children- even thought it says 3 and up on the box. Still it is great fun. Take those things in consideration if you buy."
2,Save your money,We were searching for an airport playset for my four and a half year olds Christmas list. There aren't many reasonably priced sets that have also received good reviews. We decided to go with this one.Mistake. The set is very cheaply made. The pieces all come off very easily. I tried gluing most of it together and instead the pieces just broke under a bit of pressure.It's a shame because my son really likes having an airport but this toy is just too unreliable and fragile to recommend purchasing.
1,One trick in this book is dangerous to your cat,"Caution: One trick in this book is physically dangerous to your cat. Our vet said it is dangerous for a cat to stand-up on their back legs. Their hind legs can not support this activity. You will injure your cat. Please stop this trick. There are many, many other tricks cats can learn & not hurt themselves over time. PS Dog's hind legs can support standing-up - just not cats legs."
5,this is a great book,I train cat and this is the best book every all my friend and customer love it. Are you bor of trying everything with no help or iprovment. This book is the key she tell how to do in so many different was if you don't like 1 just go to the next. If you love your cat it will show with this book. and it is so cheap that if you don't like it you could sell it ... have fun with this book. i did!!! love your cat or cats
4,Excellent training techniques,"This book has excellent training techniques. I particularly enjoyed the wide variety of training methods. Speaking from experience, the methods work. I was able to teach my cat to sit, within just a small amount of time I saw results. There are techniques from teaching your cat to stay off the table to teaching him to play dead. I was amazed at the different tricks a cat can learn. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who loves their cat and wants to prove that their cat is smart."
1,waste of time,"If you want to train your cat, this book is a wast of time.Sally Franklin doesn't really tell us how to do it in many cases.Many of her 50 ways are not telling us much. ""to get on with the vet: 4. Take your cat on a visit to meet the vet...this initial meeting will enable you how to assess how your cat adapts to the vet's handling. 5. If the initial meeting goes well, register your cat with the parctice."" Ok, and if it doesn't?Or: ""To climb a tree and get down: 1. Now encourage the cat to back down the tree."" How, Id' like to know!""3. If this doesn't work, use a ladder, or seek expert help from your local Fire Station"" Well, thanks for the advise.Better read Karen Pryors Book "" Getting started: Clicker Training for Cats""!"
2,Glad I didn't pay full price,"I have to agree with the other reviewer who said this book was a waste. I found the large majority of this book to be a waste of paper, and the only halfway useful parts are in the ""Clever Cats"" section in the back of the book (pages 58-64) which helps to teach tricks such as sitting, begging, shake hands, jump through a hoop, etc.There is one section ""Train your cat to respect caged pets."" I eagerly turned to this page in the book, as I do have a caged pet, and read: ""Keep both parties away from each other, in seperate parts of the house."" Gee thanks. I think I had that one figured out BEFORE I bought this book.All I have to say is that I'm glad I bought this book used."
3,"one way, 50 times","I found it lacking in detail, basically describing one way (positive reinforcement) used in 50 different applications. Much of the advice simply isn't practical."
2,Cats aren't Computers,"This book seemed like most Computer books I read. Define the problem and then a procedural step by step list of how to ""solve"" the problem. It just seems cold, calulating and impersonal. This may work with computers, but not with something living. The book just lists the steps, and if your cat doesn't follow the steps listed, oh well.The author also seems to be streaching to reach the 50 training tips mentioned in the title as most seemed to come natural to my cats or were common sense to me."
2,not very helpful,"Very standard info. As both my cats are indoors and declawed (very busy street), nearly half this book is useless. The other half is quite standard and gives very little help or encouragement for further training."
1,What is this???,"What is a Christian Goth? So your saying that one can be apart of something evil,but then thats ok because your a Christian? I don think so. Well frankly Rackets and drapes are a Marylin Manson/Alice Cooper rip off. Tim ""Kandy Kane"" Haas,lets get serious. Fight against what these kids are doing instead of going down to their level so they think you are cool and so they will listen to your music. I am pretty sure that someone who is Gothic needs to get out of the whole scene other than make themselves feel better by listening to Christian """"Gothic"""" music. Gothic has to do with death and other Satanic babblings. Its like saying you don't like Halloween yet you go trick or treating. Being a hypocrite. If you are Gothic you are apart of the whole Gothic scene. There is no such thing as a Christian Gothic scene. Get a life."
3,horror show metal,"Rackets & Drapes is not, despite what Christian media sources would label it, the Christian counterpart of Marilyn Manson. They are a self-described horror-show schtick rock band. Their sound is in this fashion, complete with synthed pipe and church organs, distorted guitars, and frightening vocals. Tim ""Kandy Kane"" Haase, the frontman and lead singer, is a very competent yet simple lyricist, getting straight to the point, and breaching topics that other Christian bands wouldn't dare mention. This album is by far an excellent first venture, but I know that R&D can do much better. Perhaps their next album's production will fill in the valley of this almost demo-ish recording. For the full effect, see the band live in concert, and don't forget your black lipstick."
3,"Like others said, it's a good book for newbies but.........","This is a good book for newbies but for the technicly enclined individual that can already explain many of the TCP/IP fundimentals and related protocols. It's really kind of a published version of whatis.com or webopedia making it a good refrence manual, but if you already have a clue and are looking for technicly advanced material then invest the money on 1000 pages elsewhere such as certification orientaded books for network+, ccna, or ccnp."
3,"LOTS, and I mean LOTS of mistakes","I was hired to translate this book into Romanian, and I was amazed at the number of factual errors that slipped through its editing. Ultimately, my translation report contained about 25 pages of errors in the source book.A hilarious example can be found at page 140. It says about the IP address space that ""This makes for a total of 4,294,967,296 IPs. Not so many when you think about it. There are more than four times that many people in China alone""Heaven forbid China had 17 billion people."
2,"Ok, but not the next Schaeffer . .","I was about 15 when I read this the first time, and was mightily impressed by it. Since then I have had six years of life experience to add, and two years of Philosophy at Bristol University - and looking back on the book I can see weaknesses I was not aware of before. As stated by other reviewers, Zacharias does an awful lot of ""argument from authority"" and often little to back it up. He does make some good points, but they are often repeated and bulked out with numerous illustrations (which are helpful, but tend to just pad it out some of the time). If you only want to scratch the surface of philosophy then this is probably what you want - if you want to dig deep then try 'Christian Apologetics' by Norman Geisler. Habermas and Geivett's ""In Defense of Miracles"" provides a staunch refutation of Hume's (and by extension, Flew's) arguments against the possibility of miracles."
2,A plead from authority.,"If you want a good Christian apologetic work, this book isn't it. There is nothing here except big words, insults, and arguments from authority. I don't believe there is a single instance where Ravi Zacharas uses logic or reason to prove any of his points. Atheism leads to immorality - why? - because some guy in a Nazi death chamber said that the gaurds didn't believe in god. Evolution isn't true - why? - because Phillip Johnson said so. And so on.Zacharias needs to read some books on atheism if he wishes to attack it. For one thing, *he doesn't even know what atheism is!!!* He defines atheism as the ""dogmatic denial of God"" because Paul Edwards and others said so. Of course, he gets absolutely nowhere attacking his straw-man fantasy version of atheism.This book will work only for Christians, because Zacharias goes on and on about how God wants this and it would be great to believe in his God. Things that only a Christian would agree with, without any forethought or proof."
5,Superb,"When I applied to the University of Wales for doctoral studies, I was asked to list five books (besides the bible) that have had the greatest impact on me. This was one of the ones I listed. This book taught me more than any other on how to properly use logic when exploring theology. It also highlights the massive effects of the philosophies of Nietzsche, Sarte, Kant, Hume, and others on the current relgious landscape. Zacharias is a wonderful writer as well."
4,bad philosophy huh?,"I have found philosophy to be an unsatisfactory tool for getting a handle on reality, just as the apostle did before the Epicureans and Stoics. My path to understanding therefore came about by a different root - firstly, by looking at the scientific evidence and seeing that a naturalist origin of life and the universe was statistically impossible, e.g. If the existence or non-existence of God could be proved philosophically someone would have accomplished that by now. The same is true of the quest for scientific proof. But the nature of the problem necessarily restricts us."
3,"A straight foward ""no-nonsense"" period performance.","Very polished ""no-nonsense"" performance in the period style. Some will appreciate the unmannered way in which it is performed others will interpret this as being a bit dull. If you want a ""complete"" set in terms of it's various versions this is the performance to get. (It is available on THREE cd's which includes variations which can be programmed into your CD player) As a performance it's icy cool . As a recording the sound is very dry lacking in bloom."
3,Complete -but to buy?...,"McGegan and rather his engineers do not feel the depth of the work. Unfortunately enough, because his name ""sells"" the disc, and people will be disappointed under the xmas tree.The completeness of it is stunning. A precise ""higlight"" CD containing all the alternative versions elsewhere unavailable would have been eloquent, however, would have made the complete one unsalable. There exists a single highlight CD, which is a trade-off between the ideal and a neglectible."
3,Queen Margot,I enjoyed this movie. It is based on the history of the time when religious freedom was not the way in europe. This is not a fun action movie but more of a education of the time and the views of the country and city with the dirt and filth every much a part of the movie. This is a recommend watch from me.Queen Margot (La Reine Margot)
2,Not anamorphic widescreen,This is not an anamorphic widescreen dvd - shame on Miramax. So buyer beware!
1,Huh?,"Very noisy. Very confused. The character development was so poor that I never figured out who was who, what their motives were, or why I should give a flip what happened to any them. Absolutely a sickening film. Gave me a terrible headache."
1,Slop,"Visually arresting but otherwise hodgepodge compilation of events and themes.What was this film about? Sex, death, sex, death, sex, death.It is not about the title character unless one wants to remember her as someone picking up strangers for passionless encounters in allies or someone who embraces the dismembered remains of one of her many lovers. What a legacy!The lead actors are stunning to look at, the sets and costumes exquisite but this film is otherwise nothing much."
3,A half-decent historical drama,"La Reine Margot/Queen Margot feels like that old joke about starting with an earthquake and building up to a climax. The first half is very impressive as it builds up to the bloodily realized St Bartholomew's Day Massacre, but the aftermath is less effective despite a number of potentially intriguing plot developments and relationships. But then, director Patrice Chereau is always better at set-up than delivery. Certainly you tend to observe the characters as they go through hoops rather than being particularly involved with them. Isabelle Adjani's performance doesn't help matters: she's fine as the icy royal in the first half, but she never convincingly thaws once the horrendous lengths her family are prepared to go to becomes apparent. Daniel Auteuil overdoes the eyepopping mugging as her reluctant and justifiably nervous husband, but Jean-Hughes Anglade as the weak and doomed king and Virna Lisi as the ice-veined Catherine de Medici genuinely impress."
5,BUY IT,"I've seen this movie six years ago in the cinema and I had to get in VHS by the Amazon.com Marketplace. It's one of the best french movies I've ever seen (the other is La Nuit de Varennes). No doubt, BUY IT!!!"
2,Flaws Everywhere One Looks,"Even knowing something about the tumultuous history of France at the time this film is set won't make this murky plot much clearer. Falsely billed in such a way that it is aimed at both lovers of history and those who appreciate cinematic eroticism (and hey, who doesn't?) Queen Margot fails to deliver to either audience. Purporting to enlighten us as to the machinations of those who paired the Protestant Henri (future king Henri IV) with the ardently Catholic Margot, played by she of the stunningly beautiful eyes, Isabelle Adjani, what unfolds in this slow-moving period piece is little above confusion. I pity anyone who goes into this movie without a background on French religious history of the late 1500's, and I truly can't grasp what it is about this production that makes critics review it so generously."
4,VERY GOOD FILM,"I'm not up on this period of history so I had to keep playing certain portions of the movie over and over. But it is a well-acted and sumptiously film vehicle. I had some trouble remembering which one of Margot's brother's were which and who was fight who. It's hard to watch such an action-filled film and have to read sub-titles too. But I eventually figured everything out and went on a great ride. There's much innuendo about incest which went over my head but since the possibilities were not central to the story, it mattered not. Isabelle Adjani is exquisitely and panssionate as Margot. The sets and costumes are lush and the cinematography superb. I have to go brush up on this period of history - I hope it is as frightening and interesting as this film portrays it here."
4,THIS HISTORY IS HOT,"I'm surprised no reviewer mentioned the steamy sex scenes in this movie, particularly the one where the Queengoes street walking to find some action and, quite taken with Perez, is then taken up against a wall.Holds its own with the best stuff in UNFAITHFUL.(I guess this is also a warning to those who prefer their history unadulterated.)"
2,Did I miss something?,"I'm blown away by all the reviews praising this film for historical accuracy! While it has its moments, and Adjani is luminous in the role of Margot, this film is as anachronistic and silly in its own way as the American fluff piece, ""Dangerous Beauty."" Catherine de Medici's court was definitely full of political intrigue and sex, but the wedding scene, for example, comes across like a costume party in a discoteque. What was with the music? I felt the film was straining to shock its audience, and the result is a tedious, self-conscious mess."
1,Horrible.,"Should not be sold as a romance, as it's more about looking at dirty people who are overly dramatic. Hated film and trashed it. Whatever sense of history was implied, it lacked the potential that could have been there."
5,kept me fascinated,I was channel surfing and came across this on Cinemax and was spellbound. I rifled through the Tv Guide to see what it was and stayed tuned until the end. It was so fascinating and enthralling. It gave me a bit of insight into a bit of history that I never paid much attention to before. My heart went out to the King as he lay dying as his guilt became so obvious and the execution in the end was wrenching and so emotional to the viewer. Unfortunately it is not available on DVD or VHS so I will be scanning around trying to find a copy for my collection. Truly a superb movie and a keeper.
5,Breathtaking.,"This movie absolutely swept me off my feet, the costumes, the acting, the music, the story. I cannot recommend it enough. A work of art that violently, yet delicately takes you through a breathtaking and epic romance."
4,Queen Margot,"Very interesting. Good Romance. Subttitles are hard to get used to, but I like the movie."
3,An accurate window on the past?,"Being of Huguenot descent (Francois du Toit arrived in Cape Town, South Africa in 1686), I looked forward to learning more about my ancestors in this movie. I recognise some of the names and events from history books, but is there a historian out there who would comment on the accuracy of the movie?Not a feel-good movie, but very realistic as far as I can tell."
1,Displeased,I would have enjoyed this dvd but unhappily this disc would not play on my dvd player. I could not get it to play on my television dvd player either.
1,Queen Margot (La Reina Margot) (La Reine Margot),I did not like any part of this movie. There were no English subtitles and therefore I could not understand one thing about the movie.
5,R&B That makes you laugh as well as dance,"This is some knee-slappin', gut-bustin', hee-haw, fall-down-on-the floor funny stuff that has a beat that you can dance to. If you're over 18 and hip to double-entendre and euphemisms, you'll roll with laughter and joy at songs like ""Walkin' Blues,"" ""Butcher Pete,"" ""10 Inch Record,"" ""Keep On Churnin,"" ""I Love To Play Your Piano,"" etc. Modern rappers should listen to this to see that you don't have to blatantly curse to be funny. These songs are hilarious in what they leave to the imagination."
2,"RISQUE, but not that entertaining","""Annie Had a Baby"" and ""60 minute Man"" were super. The sound was fine. The other selections were Risque, but to this 72 year old, the majority of the songs were no better than RISQUE."
4,Back to Basics,"This book is easy to read as well as interesting and informative. It compares the Biblical laws about foods with what our society is telling us today. You may be surprised to learn some facts about your current diet and what it is doing to your body. God has given us an abundance of good foods, but we in America tend to reject them in favor of junk foods and processed foods with all the nutrients taken out. Without being too pushy, it makes you want to eat healthier. It contains a number of recipes and other helpful resources. Also included are some spiritual principles related to food."
5,Foods from the Bible,Our ladies church group was studying two books of the Bible and one the book of Ruth dealt with grains so we were studying the types of food available during the time of this story. This book was helpful and we could create lots of foods to make our study interesting.We prepared our study for the congregation and then had a social hour serving several tables full of foods prepared like they had in Bible times.
1,A great disappointment,"I really loved all three of the previous books in this series. I am not a Quaker, nor even a Christian, but I was deeply interested in Elizabeth Elliot and her spiritual journey, which complemented in a very suitable way the mystery story in each book.I had some difficulty in believing that the same author had written this book. It was preachy, unfocussed, digressive and completely unsatisfying, all things the previous ones were not. I have much sympathy with the political position the author takes in this book, but it's a d**n poor mystery story, and not even a good political rant, as each gets in the way of the other. Distressing."
5,"Stories typical of the era, but beautifully rendered","I just received the book a few days back and scanned and speed read a few stories. Compared to the stories published today , they seem very bland and childish. Still a worthy record of the era the books were published in and the circumstances and restrictions placed on the publishers.Marvellous artwork, a redeeming feature.A must own, not for the stories per se but as a nostalgic reminder of comic history.Suggest owning both volumes just to delve into our comic past.A boon for all comic lovers."
3,Why every parent in Denver should have this book!,"This book is GREAT! It really gives you a detailed list of what fun things there are to do in Denver. Some of the things I've never heard from any other source and my kids love them!There are a couple of negatives. The book was published in 1999, so some of the places have closed and almost all of the prices have changed, so I always have to do some extra research before we go. Also, there are some new great places in the area that are not listed in the book.I would recommend that anyone planning to visit Denver for an extended period of time or if you live here, you HAVE to have this book. It is well worth the investment."
3,Lasco White Rubber Garbage Disposal Stopper,"I was disappointed in the stopper because it was not as pictured. I thought the entire stopper was made of rubber, which is what I wanted. Neither the picture nor the description indicated that the piece for removing the stopper is made of metal. Other than that, it works."
5,Susan Meddaugh Rhymer Extraordinaire!,"We absolutely love Susan Meddaugh. She skillfully creates her many rhyming tales without making the rhymes feel forced. After discovering this book we set out to purchase every Meddaugh book we could find. So far we have ""Just Teenie"", ""Harry on the Rocks"", ""Tree of Birds"", and ""Hog Eye"". I'm avoiding the Martha Speaks series as the kids can watch that on PBS. But we're working toward collecting all her other books with special emphasis on those that rhyme.What a wonderful way to start children off in the world of words. The stories are wonderfully creative and the rhyming is magically fun. All the books I have listed are books the kids take out on a regular basis and even the older ones enjoy having them read aloud (even if they're too ""cool"" to take them off the shelf for personal enjoyment).You can't go wrong with these books, especially if you have a struggling or reluctant reader."
2,Too complicated and still can't wake with iPod,"My daughter received this iPod alarm clock as a gift and was really excited about setting it up. She figured out the alarm settings pretty quickly and had her iPod playing, but after more than an hour of testing we still couldn't get the alarm to work with the iPod. The instruction manual is poorly written and the settings are so complicated.I think there are probably much better systems on the market for the price. I highly recommend exploring those options."
1,Disappointed,"Ipod part works fine, I know most younger people want only FM ( which I didn;t really try that much) but if your looking for an AM radio, forget it. Even with the AM antena provided, it doesn't even bring in local stations.The reason that I purchased it was because it had a Base & Treble control and I could lower the base for speech understanding. The length & height are fine but it's too deep. Instruction book is poor. I'm sorry that I threw away the box or I would have sent it back."
2,Misprint or mistake,i found some misprint or mistake on this sudoku book. puzzle number 50 and 53. wrong answer solution on puzzle number 50. puzzle number 53 is mess up. thats all i can say so far.
3,Easier than i expected,"Even though I only have try 2 of the 200 puzzles, it have been quite easy. The title is 200 most difficult sudoku puzzles, however I think 200 medium difficult sudoku puzzle is mroe suitable for its name."
4,Lene Lovich 'Stateless',"Clever, poppy, engaging - European in flavour without being weighty, if you know what I mean. Pleasant, upbeat."
2,ok for what it is but.....,"Whenever I buy a cd I will listen to it completely to see if I like at least have of the songs if not I'll get rid of it. Lene Lovich barely made it, most of these songs are just too bland for me. Although I can see why everyone likes Lucky Number its fun and u can dance to it. Other highlights for me were Sleeping Beauty, Say When (although the lyrics were rather cheesy), Momentery Breakdown (had to grow on me), Be Stiff (was intersesting because I heard a Devo version of this there's was better her's is ok though) Big Bird and Blue. Honestly the main reason im keeping this for collective purposes so if u like female post punk/new wave artists I would go with Siouxsie or the Slits or somebody."
5,The Gospel According to St John,"Great book to have in ones library. Involved with a biblical study group - I enjoy reading Scripture, our professor brought his book to class-I took down the information to buy the book."
1,Worst one I've heard,"Normally, I love these audio versions of P.G. Wodehouse books, but this one is awful. The combination of poor reading by Ian Carmichael (IMHO) and a derivative story with no comic timing make this one I recommend you skip.I can not believe that Wodehouse actually wrote this one. It seems like a ghost writer took many of his favorite plot devices (star-crossed lovers prevented from getting married and a cow creamer for example) and many of his common expressions (""like the cat in the adage""), crammed them into a paper bag, shook the bag violently, and then pulled them out one by one, typing as he went.I strongly recommend that you avoid this one like the plague."
4,Great Book to Listen to on Tape,"This was my first P G Wodehouse and I listened to this on tape. The person reading it, makes Bertie Wooster come alive and it is very witty and I thoroughly enjoyed it. The slang may be a bit different, but given in the context of the book, I am sure you could figure it out. Jeeves has taken off for his holiday in this particular book, and Bertie is invited to Aunt Delia's for the time to help her entertain guests from America. Bertie discovers before he leaves for his visit, that he has proposed marriage to Roberta and it is posted in the London Times. Bertie knows Roberta will be at Aunt Delia's and proceeds to go there and find out when it was that she accepted his marriage proposal. His understanding and subsequent bumblings lead you on a merry path. Not really that much of a mystery, but a delightful book still."
4,Good product for the Money,This cabinet is a pretty good unit for the price. It does not include instructions. With a little time and common sense you can easily figure it out. It's nice having the reversable dry erase/cork board door.
4,Good starter book,"For someone who is doing this for the first time, this book is a good place to start."
2,OVER DONE DECOR....,"If I had paid more for this book no doubt it would be returned....If you are interested in over done,country style decor then you would be happy with this book!"
4,Good Decorating Book,"I purchased about 7 decorating books on Amazon since getting my first house about 9 months ago. I would put this one in my top 5. The information inside is great - I love the measurements it provides as well as info on how to place furniture. I actually used some of the tips in the book for my combined living/dining room furniture and it came out perfect - and I never would have thought to do it on my own. She's a big advocate for keeping furniture off walls if possible and I was impressed with my results. I gave it 4 stars because, as a visual person, I would have liked to have seen more larger pictures showcasing the whole space instead of the little ones featuring sections of a room, but nonetheless, I was impressed. Definitely a good decorating book to have on hand!"
3,"Outdated pictures, timeless concepts","This book was published in 1999, and the shown styles in the pictures are very much outdated. It's an easy read, though, and it still touches on the general concepts that will apply today and in the future. I wish I had paid attention to the publishing date. I was looking for a more organized book of design do's and don't's. This is not that book. It's in more paragraph form."
1,Raclette is first and foremost a cheese....,"I do not own the book but I just looked at the first few pages. I was mostly interested in the list of cheeses the author recommended. To my surprise the original cheese is not listed: Raclette. ""Raclette"" is not a grill or even a technique to cook with cheese, IT IS A CHEESE.I think the author missed something the last time she went to the Alps (IF she went...)"
2,An Outdated Guide for Today's Raclette Crowd,"I will agree with the other reviewers who state that the book leaves a bit to be desired in introducing one to the world of raclette; I must insist, however, that contrary to what one of our reviewers says, the word ""raclette"" here within the border Alpine states (Germany, Switzerland), can also refer to the cooking practice of using a 'raclette' grill to prepare a tableside meal with raclette cheese and various other ingredients, much in the way that the word ""barbeque"" can describe a way of cooking in the US, but can additionally be used to describe a particular ingredient or finished meal as well."
2,Nice recipes - lousy binding,"This book has some good recipes that I have tried and had good success with. However, after opening it for the 3rd time it is now a collection of separate sheets - it is no longer a book! After the first look in it I had to tape about half of the pages to keep it together but that wasn't enough!I would be better if it would be sold as a downloadable Acrobat file."
3,Not quick and easy,"The recipes seemed unduly complex to me, and I'm not crazy about their cheese choices."
2,Not Quite Believable,"It starts out with an interesting enought storyline, but it becomes difficult to believe what motivates Jeff Goldblum's character to continue to want to impersonate this ex-con at sigificant expense and humiliation to himself. A complete stranger who he knows for less than a few minutes. Was penpal Anne Hechte's character that desireable? The job search to become a liquor/deli store clerk or bust, seemed painfully degrading for this sucessful insurance executive who did not seem unhappy with his former life. The policeman who keeps his eye on Goldblum, seemingly knowing what is happening inside him while he undergoes this identity change, was also hard to buy. He had no motivation to do this as it did not appear that a crime was or would be committed. The speech about his only mini identity crisis near the end was a weak excuse for his watching Goldblum.I saw it through because I kept thinking something interesting would happen, a twist somewhere, but it failed to deliver."
3,Evil Laugh,"I cannot believe Amazon is selling a brand new copy of this film for $43.99. Anyways, the evil laugh shows up after the first kill that happens in thebut it's quickly forgotten about thru out this movie. I can only remember the laugh once or twice during the kills. I really cannot remember much of what happens in this movie but it was enjoyable. The kills were decent and the microwave kill was just plain laughably stupid, even though it was pretty bloody. It's an 80's slasher film so it's worth checking it out once for a used price rather then paying the asking price from Amazon."
5,Worst movie ever. An abonimation. A plague on humanity.,"This fine film is a vehicle for up and coming superstar Steven Baio. It's obvious where all the talent in the Baio family went. I'd even go as far to say that it should've been ""Steven in Charge"" or ""Steven loves Joanie."" A revolutionary statement, but a true one nonetheless. Other reviewers might disagree with me, but I stand by my word. One of the opening scenes is simply enthralling, exhibiting a hilarious comedic twist when one of Baio's friends accidentally urinates on a couple sitting on the beach. You can only imagine how good it gets from there. Don't let me spoil it for you, rent this classic today!"
3,80's slasher fun!,"this movie isn't selling for a hight price,so if you like cheesy 80's slasher flicks,buy evil laugh.it's worth it."
4,Not just for designers...,"The minute I picked up this book, I could not put it down. There are so many great ideas in it, that it makes it almost impossible not to try to be a little bit more organized. I work in Advertising and it's been a great help.It's come in handy when I'm designing because it has such a great sense of space, structure and balance. This book is a must for anyone who needs help getting organized."
2,I suppose in 1966 this was cutting-edge stuff...,"I read this book because of its obvious influences on Roger Zelazny's AMBER books, but Farmer's material suffers mightily in comparison. The characters in GATES are caricatures--I've seen characters developed much more fully in the space of a single comic book than this-- and the plot consisted of nothing more than a series of hokey hurdles for the main character to jump--even as he repeatedly, redundantly, insults and criticizes his relatives. Over and over. Farmer also suffers here from ""tell, don't show."" Rather than watching the characters figure things out, we are often simply *informed* of this by the text. How disappointing. Unlike a previous reviewer, I don't wish to spoil the ending, but I have to question how someone can claim Urizen is a great villain when he scarcely even appears in the book. This is pulp material at its most mediocre and only the last few pages saves it from utter failure. Read the Amber books instead."
4,The only keyboard I will use,"I've been using a Microsoft Natural Ergo since the company introduced them four years ago.My wrist were hurting from using the started issue PC keyboard for many hours a day.After making the switch to the Natural key layout it took me about a month to get used to the key positions, but after that I was hooked and I no longer have pains in my wrist.The only bad deal here is you have to pay for the mouse too.If you want to pay more you could get the Natrual Pro, and you'll have a button to spawn your web browser, change audio levels, etc... For me the cost difference doesn't justify what I could do in a few simple mouse clicks."
5,A must for any new Mac owner,"Terry White's Mac OS X Training for Windows Users is superb. It is a must for any new Mac owner, and has much to offer the experienced Mac user as well. Terry clearly demonstrates how to get around the new operating system, with actual monitor video demonstrations, and his illustrations are easy to understand. The DVD makes it easy to stop and then return where you left off. While the Mac's OS is very intuitive, and you CAN just start it up and go, this easy training DVD will greatly enhance your enjoyment and navigation around your new computer."
3,NOT a Hammer Film--But Good Creepy Fun Anyway,"Several reviewers have erroneously identified this as a film from the great Hammer Films. It's not--""The Creeping Flesh"" is an Amicus production, from one of Hammer's British rivals. However, this has the great gothic horror atmosphere that was one of Hammer's trademarks. And it has Lee and Cushing, perennial Hammer stars, in wonderful performances. The plot is surprisingly complex, with some neat twists, and the creature, when it appears, is memorable. Recommended for all fans of horror who believe that plot, not f/x, matter."
4,Something of a Cabinet of Caligari,"If this film ever gets a high definition Blu-ray version, I might give it 5 stars. Not to tell too much, but this film plays a bit like The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari. It may be the last really great film to pair British horror stars Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee (who were together in such excellent films as ""Horror of Dracula"" and the 1959 version of ""The Hound of the Baskervilles"" -- My favorite of all filmed versions of that story)."
4,Good scary horror British movie!! Buy it now!,"I'm keeping this review short and sweet:Really good horror movie and the ending is just insane and very clever!I would give it 5 stars however there's no audio commentary, original trailer, deleted scenes, interviews or other special features!I hope one day somebody will give the special treatment to this great classic horror movie!!Buy it!!"
4,Good presentation of a quality British horror film,"There are plenty of reviews here giving you the details of the film's plot, so I'll be brief here. This was my first exposure to this well-made and fairly creepy film from 1972. Even though it's not a Hammer Studios production, it certainly will appeal to fans of Hammer, with the studios' two biggest stars and one of its better directors.Like many films of its era (including Hammer ones), the pacing might be a bit slow for some modern viewers. But the payoff in this case is worth the wait. In addition to a genuinely scary climax, the twist ending is quite memorable. Add to that solid performances, a suprisingly literate script, and a handful of gooey effects, and The Creeping Flesh is solid entertainment for fans of this kind of material.The print used for this DVD is quite good. I play all my movies on a Blu-ray player and 52"" screen, and I can't really think of anything bad to say about the picture or sound. A theatrical trailer is the only extra."
1,A Great Performance - destroyed by Amazon's streaming.,"A superb ensemble - and Marvin surprises as Hickey - with Ryan providing a stoic, but crumbling center that we know cannot hold.But Amazon's streaming fails so often and so completely - including complete deterioration at Hickey's party ... That I must give this a one star rating. It's a great film version of a great play, but not *as sold* here.Avoid it."
5,The Ice Man Cometh,"Though the miasma of existentialism and the inability to hope for more than present disappointment is a mainstay within much of Eugene O'Neill's oeurve, this particular version of the ""Iceman Cometh"" achieves a rendition that would not be possible without the lynchpin of its principal lead, Lee Marvin. Though Jason Robards has with much reason been considered the most cogent interpreter of O'Neill's darkest musings, Marvin's persona of the more believable street smart everyman hits home with greater impact. He is the perfect foil for the prodigious talents of his costars. I consider this a must have version."
2,wrong edition,"I'm pretty sure the product I bought was the seventh edition, but I received the third edition. I really needed the seventh edition, so I proceeded to buy it elsewhere, having learned that you can't rely on Amazon to get specific editions of a text. The product even calls itself a 'hardcover'; indeed it is not."
3,For the Aficionado only,"Whilst the recordings on this CD may be of historical significance, they are not very inspiring to listen too. The overall sound and recording quality could best be described as flat. While this is not a bad CD, it is not one that I'd recommend for the average jazz fan. Overall, to my ears this was a disappointment."
1,dreadful,"This is a dreadful film which shows little understanding of the playwrights original intention and particularly the humor inherent in the original script. Instead the director and cast go for mugging, pratfalls and a wild and now hopelessly outdated ""60's"" feeling -"
4,A Classic!,"I teach Ionesco and theatre of the absurd, and this is a great follow up to reading the book in class. A bit dated, since it is from the 1970s, but still a highly entertaining and challenging film."
3,Disappointing,"I ordered this to give to my mom for her birthday since she is having to re-learn how to cook for just one person. I had looked at the Betty Crocker/AARP cookbook preview and was quite impressed. So, I figured this one would be just as good. I was disappointed, first of all, that it is a rather small book. (I guess I should've paid more attention to the product page.) And secondly, I was hoping that the recipes would be simpler and use more common ingredients."
5,Available Copies,"Big Doc's Girl is a classic of its genre. Mary Medearis is an Arkansas native currently living in New York. You can purchase paperback copies of her book at WordsWorth Bookstore in Little Rock, AR., 1-800-880-0122."
3,"Great Product, Disappointed in Seller","BEWARE! This item was new as described in the item description, however the picture is very misleading. In the picture it appears that you will receive 2 radios, however you will actually only receive one radio. I thought that I ordered four of these radios (2 packages of 2 radios) as Motorola sells them and I only received two. This was very frustrating and the package had been opened as if the seller had intentionally tried to sell the item seperately. I am satisfied with the radios that I did receive, however the seller is another story. I recommend that you ask questions before you buy an item like this."
1,drum medicine,"Guys, Help me understand please, this is called Drum Medicine, but the most distinct sounds in this CD are FLUTEs, guitars and bird sound samples, i THOUGHT I WAS LISTENING TO SANTANA. NOT ENOUGH drums IN THE CD. too many electric instruments.i WAS SO EXCITED TO BUY THE cd BUT DID NOT HEAR ANY NATIVE CEREMONIAL , GIMBE, TALKING; POW WOW, OR SACRED-KULTRUN DRUMS. I think you strayed from the concept of the CD. Drum Medicine should not have so much other instruments, it should be more of a distinct/highly pronounced DRUM cd. Guys, when you do the other drum medicine cd and you use 99% drums, reach me i will get it. what's with the water and bird samples --come on guys, we need more drum rhythms."
5,Incredible - can this be the work of two white men?????,"You have to listen to this CD to believe it. I hear the Native American flute, drums .... it's one incredible CD. I bought it to learn to drum but enjoy listening to it just for relaxation, trance states, etc. This is superb!"
2,eh,"I have been trying to round out my DS collection with the best games out there. I just purchased the original meteos after reading glowing reviews on every review site imaginable. Everything I read gushed at how addictive and fun Meteos is. I am a huge fan of puzzle games so I decided to get it. After a few days of play, I came out very dissappointed. The point to Meteos is to drag pieces to connect groups of three. You may only drag vertically but can form groups either horizontally or vertically. Half the time you are dragging, you ignite Meteos you werent aware you were trying to connect.So I tried an experiment. Frustrated, I quickly ran the stylus up and down without even looking at what I was doing. I immediately began making matches and clearing my screen.This game is overrated by far, and the pieces fall so fast, keeping up is easy at first but impossible to be concious of creating groups of three, they just happen by accident.....I'm going to get Tetris DS instead"
3,"I thought they would love it, wrong","I really believed my girls would enjoy this game, but it was too confusing for the 6 year old, and too boring for the 11 year old. I tried it a few times, but it did tend to get old fast. The storyline didn't add much to the game, anyways, I sold it at a yard sale pretty quickly."
1,"lame, boring, and not challenging in any way","I was thinking, from reading the instruction booklet first, that this game might be like ""Dr Mario"" (a game my family LOVES). Well...let's just say that I beat the whole thing by moving my stylus up and down the touch screen madly. And I did it in an hour. My son said, ""this is the dumbest game I have ever played!""Maybe I'm too stupid to get the strategy of it all. Or too impatient. I don't know. Don't waste your money...rent it first if you really want to try it."
2,game is not as described,game always go back to the beginning. cannot pick-up where you left-off in previous play. cannot go to new level.
5,good good,"1.do you love me 2. I know you don't love me no more 3. you ll"" lose a good thing 4.green onions 5. you beat me to the punch 6.release me 7.let me in 8. lost someone 9. party lights 10. soul twist"
5,Jane Miller's Best,"""Memory at These Speeds: New and Selected Poems"" is the best introduction to Jane Miller's amazing genius. Her intellect, passion and raw edge swoop, swing and jump through this generous collection of poems that work hard at the business of love, truth and the absolute. Despite the frantic, white-knuckled pace, these poems have been distilled into ever more dense detonations. Jane Miller will shock you, and she's not scared to lose the reader at points; but one is left in the end with the tangible sense that these poems respect the reader. Truly, to have this much Jane Miller in one collection is a wonderful value and a genuine treat. She's not just working on the cutting edge of poetry--she IS the edge, and once you get a taste of the power and sheer life force packed into these pages, you'll be a fan for life."
5,Greatness,Awesome is not a word that should be used lightly...this DVD is absolutely awesome. This is without a doubt the best thing in my TV cabinet. I have enjoyed it at least 5 times already. I only wish that the DVD had all of the songs that the CD has.
5,great john denver,If you love Joh Denver you will love this DVD--I could remember being at his concerts all over again.
5,HEARTWARMING & SOOTHING!,This is a must DVD for any John Denver fan. The concert feels very intimate since he performs in front of a small audience. You almost feel like you're there in person. During the concert they show clips of John Denver talking about preserving the environment and its wildlife. He was very passionate about this topic and this is how he would like to be remembered.
4,Wildlife Concert evokes powerful memories,They say that music evokes not only emotion but reawakens powerful memories. Now that he is gone it is both that this concert arouses. The tape provides the listener/watcher with many of his old favorites mixed in with some less familiar recordings. The music is faithfully and cleanly reproduced and the photography angles are wonderful. We were in awe watching it. If you love John Denver's music - buy it. You won't be disappointed.Vinny Larkin
4,Beautiful music and scenery,Some of John Denver's greatest hits along with the beautiful scenery make this DVD a winner.
5,"John Denver, the Consummate Musician of our times!","What a delight to hear just about all of his songs sung with such gusto, yet also so poignantly in the way he changes the mood to match the lyrics of each number. The intonation of his voice is so unique that I'm almost certain to know when I'm hearing any of his songs -- and not just those that became his hits. We play this DVD over and over . . . and over again -- I hope it will never ever wear out!"
5,One of the Best,"This video is an example of why John Denver was one of the worlds most loved performers. In what is really a simple stage production he captures the hearts and attention of the audience and gives those who were left to view via video the intimate feeling of actually being there in person and enjoying the show.A versatile performer, this program amply demonstrates his truly monumental talent. Well worth the viewing."
3,Better off with VHS,"Usually, DVDs have ""extras""... they don't, in this case. Some songs are actually CUT from the VHS. The only ""extra"" is the lyrics option... It was a marvelous concert, worth 10 stars out of five, I was priviledged enough to actually be in the audience, but this release is no where near ""all that it could be..."""
3,John Denver,I loved John Denver. When I bought this DVD I didn't expect it to be an advertisement DVD thus the 3 star rating. John Denver himself on the DVD gets 5 stars. I bought 3 of these as gifts.
2,Great cause but not a great production,"First, I am a long time fan of John Devner. This production was for a great cause but they definitely went for the soundtrack and not the performance. His interaction was pretty much nil and the best part was the snipits of him talking (as in video clips, not during the concert) about his life, music and the causes.....again, not the singing, production, composition. Give to the foundation for sure, but buy a CD of his music, it just isn't as grand in this offering."
5,Great Show,"Had the chance to go to this taping, it was done on two days, Got into both show's and can say that this is one of the most special days' of my life, The only thing this DVD is missing is all the interaction Between John and all of the audience, Very special, After the show everyone that attended the show was able to say something special to maybe make it on the dvd, I wish they would add that! Thanks to Family and friends!"
3,JohnDenver wildlife concert,I didn't know there was going to be several interviews with John talking about his wildlife dreams and beliefs when i purchased the DVD but the songs are great and the sound is pretty good. Most of his well known songs are performed which I was happy about.
4,GREAT SONGS DONE REALLY WELL,"i saw this years ago on a&e.it was very cool.i liked that song about passing the pipe around w/his friends and old lady. he was a hip dude.master songwriter,and wholesome. too bad they won't release the rarely mentioned ""nutsack"" demo's.oh well,we miss ya john."
5,Great Concert,"This concert is very good. It is up beat and very much pro wildlife. It includes a lot of his most popular songs. For a John Denver fan, this is a great addition to a music library."
5,Wonderful,The best collection of music I know of for a John Denver fan. He was in great voice and backed up nicely.
5,johnny cash t-shirt,I would buy from this store agian the product came on time as promised and in prefect shape plan on buying more from this store thank you old glory
4,Great music,"The songs on this CD all have a great beat; a good listen when cooking dinner! I am not knowledgable about Arabic music by any means, but I am thoroughly enjoying this CD."
4,Dance Off Doctrine,"I was initially frustrated that the overuse of electronic enhancements on the acoustic instruments made the arrangements sound like they all used the same drum machine. However, as I've become more familiar with Algerian Rai, it's clear that's not the case. This compilation is an excellent sampler of vibrant pop music, regardless of whether or not you understand the lyrics.One standout for me is Khaled, whose other recordings I recommend.Also exceptional is Natacha Atlas. Her peice ""Kidda"" is a knockout - a revved up moan that is the female voice I've been waiting to hear for many years. (kind of a Callas/Janis fusion)."
5,Our introduction to arabic music,"Putumayo is the finest place to hear music which takes you by the collar and shakes you until your teeth fall out. We heard Arabic Groove in an upscale electronics store, bought it on the spot, and have, since then, purchased a cd by almost every artist represented. From there we have found other groups and types of music, all of which can be traced by back to this Putumayo collection.If you like this (and who wouldn't?) give North African Groove a try, in addition to the Sahara Lounge, and perhaps broaden your listening a bit, and step into African Groove. The world is full of music, and Putumayo is helping us find it."
5,"Beautiful, exotic!","Love, love, love Natacha Atlas, Dania Khatib and Khaled!... The women's voices on this CD are exotic, mesmerizing... Love the jazzy sax in Khaled's song. The mixture of styles is entertaining. The CD is beautifully mixed and the artists are passionate, talented. This is a really fun CD that I listen to over and over."
2,Too pop-ish.,Nothing groovy about this. Too 'poppy' for my liking. I was expecting something a little more laid back. Listen first before buying.
1,This thing [is bad],"I thought it would groove,hence the name. It's just abrabic music not dance or anything that grooves. I would feel less nauseated riding on the back of a camel. I give this as low a rating as possible simply for mislabeling their product."
3,way too overproduced,"It's not that the blending of Arabic and Western grooves is not good but too often the production is way too slick. Some of this stuff is brilliant such as Abdel Ali Slimani or Dania, but others like Abdy or Amr Diab are way too syrupy musically. I mean, axe the Mantovani elevator music string instruments in the background.This is my main complaint about a lot of so-called ""World"" Music. Stick with what you know. Personally, you're better off picking up the Rough Guide to Bellydance Music or the Rai compilation, if that's your thing.I, on the other hand, much prefer truly original world music like the stuff out of South Africa, Mozambique or West Africa. This Arabic Groove just seems like a bunch of bad Vegas via Algiers type acts."
5,Nice little book on Hubble,I was just taking a break from my other stuff in the library that I came across this book on the juvenile shelf at my local library. The book is a breeze to read and will whet your appetite to know more about Edwin Hubble if you have ever been curious about this famous astronomer. Edwin was a giant among his contemporaries and was the reason that Einstein had to make changes in his general theory of relativity.
3,Typical Incognito--an overall good album.,"this is a decent incognito cd. maysa's great, and so in jocelyn brown, but the continutity is not there. this cd utilizes over 50 musicians, which leaves the music content spreadout, and it seems as if the sum of the musicians is less than the parts. it's worth purchasing, but doesn't have the fire of ""positivity"" or the ""live from tokyo"" cd's."
5,One of Incognito's Best CD's,"10 years ago when I first purchased this CD in 1999, everyone was worried about Y2k. I thought then that is was very cool that Incognito put out a cd Called ""No time like the future"". I felt the title was inspirational and could put most peoples concerns about Y2k at ease. But when I placed it in my CD player and listened, all my feelings about the title were correct. This cd is inspirational, It's cool and calming as well. I have been a Incognito fan since the early 1990's and this CD as well as 1993 Positivity are my Favorites. I love this CD from begining to end, and It will always be in my Collection."
4,Wish it had more Maysa.,"This album seems to return to the Tribes sound of Incognito, at least in its direction. Maysa does some great scat singing in at least 2 tracks; I wish we heard more of this. For long time Incognito fans this one is better than ""100 Degrees"", but still not as good as Positivity or Tribes because the material isn't quite as deep, both musically and lyrically."
4,Marrakech is a slammin track!!,"How this CD got in my hands is a long story, why I haven't given it back and also bought another is why I writing this. The CD is banging!! The first track I heard from this CD was ""Marrakech"". Incognito created an underground clasic with that jam. I admit that after all of the music this man has created, I never bought anything until now. ""More of Myself"" has a nice vibe, ""Fearless"" has a groovin acid-jazz swing to it..... the entire CD is amazing. In my opinion, the CD should be grabbed for ""Marrakech"" alone.oNe"
5,Gods and no monsters,There are some feelings one can never describe. Listening to Wild and Peaceful makes you feel joyful. Maysa has ever been superb and she got even better with Jocelyn's threat. Halfway through Nights of Egypt you begin to feel what's coming. Both are divas. Jocelyn is one of the greatest voices ever! Both make it a thrill and a unmatched experience!
2,Disappointing.,"I was introduced to the techno genre by a friend from Florida, an area rife with clubs very much unlike the usual fare where I'm from. My techno fan-hood was carefully groomed through artists such as Darude, Mirwais, Zombie Nation, New Order, Prodigy, and Rob Zombie. After experiencing such talent, I obviously have a hunger for more, equally well-done fare. Maybe this CD *is* equally well-done, but I just don't see it. Its beats and vocals are entirely too reminiscent of the disco era; and though I can see the inflence of the 70s on techno, I'd prefer for the genre to show where it's *going*, not where it's been.In a nutshell, if you're looking for pulse-pounding beats to get your adrenaline going, look elsewhere."
1,This is the modern emperors new cologne.,"Like the title says emperors new cologne.For people that think if it costs a lot then it is really good.They do not have the talent to go out and judge colognes.People who would go out in public wearing this crap have to be pretty simple.If people tell you that you smell good,they might be getting a good laugh.TRY BEFORE YOU BUY."
2,Is the truth out there?,"Once again another book which is light on true solutions.You could find all the info within by sufting the net.What's needed is for someone to write a book with actual facts;ie.To match MARIAH CAREY ""NEED A FRIEND"",do the following;Lead vocal 200hz q=2 g=-4db1000hz q=2 g=-5db5000hz q=1.4 g=3db10000hz hi shelf g=+4dbbass etc,etc,etcall instruments etc,etc,etc(there should be a list of quite a few songs)If or when someone decides to tell, the whole true and nothing but the truth,that person will sell books by the bucket load.however this is not the book"
2,Sleepy rendition of Mahler's peppiest symphony,"I regret I am disappointed in this performance. It is so painfully slow that I wonder whether the conductor thought the musicians capable of hitting the right notes together. (In fact they do.) I prefer the more spirited versions by Bernstein, Leinsdorf, and Farberman. The main reason for collectors to buy this recording is the hard-to-find ""Blumine,"" which was one of the movements in an early draft of this symphony."
1,Bait & Switch,"This book is not what it purported to be: Winged Escorted! It is an adaption for junior readers by Maurice Holt!!! It explains naval terms, etc. as to a child which is who it was written for; stripped from the tale is what makes a good Douglas Reeman book: conflict with superiors, bravery, and the love affair between the young flier and his superior's wife. It is less than half the tale indeed. The ad for the book described it as a Bulls-Eye edition, no where was it mentioned that it was an adaption, which might have given me a clue. Although ordered about Nov. 22, I just received it yesterday (Dec. 20)- I am going to contact the bookseller and demand my money back or the real edition of the book."
4,Give your child the emotional tools they need.,"I finally found a parenting book that doesn't preach to me, or give 'quick-fix' answers. Instead, ""The Confident Child..."", helps me understand myself, and why I parent the way I do. It helps me to understand my daughter's emotions better which in turn helps me help her.I especially like the ""How to be an Imperfect Parent Without Ruining Your Childs Life"" chapter. Wonderful suggestions, that are working in the real world.With the assistance of this book Terri Apter has helped me pinpoint why my daughter's self-esteem issues arise. She's not the angry perfectionist I thought she was. Now I know where to start!"
4,One of the best little pocket knives,"Well, I have to say this is probably my most favorite knife I have ever owned, and that's saying something. I own about 30 pocket knives. But sad to say that this is a replacement for one that was given to me, the other lost at the bottom of a river. Still a great little knife, well made except that sometimes the small screws holding the handle together will get loose after some use. Just add a little locktite and they will be fine. The blade holds a edge very well and it is quite sharp. Perfect clip to hold knife just inside your pocket, finger tab opens knife very fast. I have bought three other knives and given them away as gifts, knowing they are appreciated. I own a full size evo tanto blade, but I don't like it as well as the jr., the jr. is better balanced, perfect size to carry around daily."
2,"Nice look, cheap steel.",I've used this knife a few times to cut fiberglass insulation and it takes the edge off in about two cuts. It wouldn't even cut an orange. I like the size and features but they got the heat treat wrong. That's really all that matters. At $15 I got what I payed for.
5,Best knife I own,"This has become my go-to knife for camping--small, light, sharp. The serrations are sharp enough to saw through small live branches, and it's small enough to keep on you all the time (<3inch blade)."
3,It's OK,It is a fine knife for what it is. Holds edge okay takes edge well. Clip is a little tight out of the pack but fits great now. My biggest problems with the knife is it is a little hard to open and a little small in my hand. The size would work for smaller hands youth mostly. I did not look at the size of the knife closely. But if you have small hands and want a small everyday knife this would be a good fit.
5,Great blade,Well constructed and useful knife. Just the right size to handle many tasks - the best for cutting open those annoying plastic containers. - Opening the blade is a bit stiff as well as the locking mechanism - that is my only complaint.
3,Solid knife at a good price.,"Having used mainly CRTK knives of this type before, I was somewhat dubious at the $15 price. However, for the most part, I haven't been dissappointed.Pros:+Very small size+Good level of out-of-box sharpness+Easy to unlock and sheathe knife with one hand+Stiff opening actionCons:-Stiff opening action-No way to hard-lock the blade openWhat I dislike is the opening action - it is slow to open with one hand. Something I liked about the CRTK knives was that I could very easily open it with one hand. I didn't even really need to use my wrist at all. The gerber is just stiff enough to make it an inconsistent thing to open the knife one handed.Additionally, the CRKT knives have a mechanism to lock the blade open more securely, so that its more difficult to put the blade away accidentally. The gerber lacks this.Overall, this is a decent product at a killer price. I use it mainly to cut cardboard, and it does that easily."
4,"A solid, sharp little knife","This is good for just having around. Makes a great standard pocket knife, even if a bit on the small side. Came very sharp out of the box. Easy to manipulate one-handed. Sturdy...almost too sturdy of a pocket clip. Great price. I give it two thumbs up!"
5,Decent knife,"I really like this knife for a umber of reasons, the first being the price. for the few bucks i spent, i can't complain one bit. it didn't come razor sharp from the factory, but close. a few swipes on my sharpening steel and this thing was ready to go. it opens fairly easily, and the locking mechanism holds it open securely.Overall, i'd recommend this blade for anyone who wants a good all-around beater knife that will hold an edge well."
4,great knife,"i didnt pay enough attention when purchasing. the knife was alot smaller than i thought it would be. so small that it makes it difficult to open. the blade quality is very good. i use the knife dailey at work. the blade never feels like it will fail, even when cutting thick packaging bands. overall its a good knife for a good price"
5,Really nice little knife,"I bought this knife about six months ago to replace a pocket knife I had lost. I searched around the net looking for something low-cost and light-weight. Bought this one and another larger knife to try out. I love this one. I own a small horse farm and use it for many/any cutting job. Super sharp. Easy to use. The bailing twine on a bale of hay parts at the slightest touch. It is just the right size. When I thought I had lost this one I was ready to buy a second, but found it in a pair of pants I hadn't worn for awhile. I could do without the clip because I just keep it in my pocket and sometimes the clip rubs against my leg, but I have gotten used to that."
2,"Good knife, Bad Clip","I had lost my larger evo knife, and thought i would give the smaller one a shot for 16 bucks. overall great knife, but the clip fell off within the hour. the little screws had ripped right out. I decided to ask for a refund since i figured it had to be some sort of defect. No such luck, same problem with the next one.. I kept this one, but I rarely use it since without a clip its easy to lose. I would definitely recommend the next size up in the evo line."
2,Too small and too hard to open.,"This may be my mistake for not reading the specs, but regardless a knife this small is almost useless to me. But again, it was my fault for assuming it to be bigger.What isn't my fault, however, is how difficult it is to push open with just your thumb. This is the second Gerber knife I have purchased which makes it extremely difficult to open one-handedly. I cannot stand that. If I had any patience or time, I would return the item. But instead it will sit in a drawer somewhere gathering dust."
3,"Everything's good, except that it's too small.","Everything's good, except that it's too small. If you need a tiny knife, then it's for you, otherwise don't buy."
2,Smaller than I thought; awkward to open,"In retrospect, I should have bought a knife with a 3"" blade. Everything about this knife--blade and handle--is just a bit too small for my taste.The blade was super sharp right out of the box.To open the knife is a two-step deal. Use your forefinger on a bump at the base of the blade to open the knife half way; then, use your thumb on the stud to open the rest of the way. You cannot open it using just the thumb/stud method. I find the opening process more awkward than other knives.Seems to be of typical good Gerber quality."
3,Hard to handle,"This knife feel good overall, strong blade, comfort handle and small enough to be pocket knife. The one thing that frustrate me is it is really hard to pop out the blade. You most likely have to use 2 hands to open it and even then, it'll take sometimes. not good for a protection knife."
2,Straight Foward Review,"I'll make this short and sweet. Ive had this knife for 3 months now and Ive had to sharpen it 7 times already. The only action this knife sees is a few boxes and my mail. Opening it is very stiff, you actually need to put some wrist action while you open it.I tried loosening the privet screw a bit,it was faster...but for the cost of blade play. The reason it has two star is for its weight and size. Honestly this knife is not worth it, if you want a knife with the same design, faster deployment, and a more durable blade.... Get the CRKT M16-01z its less then ten bucks more...Ps.. Whoever posted those pictures must think we're clueless... We all know what a fricken liner lock is!!!!"
3,It's ok,"Just got my EVO Jr., it's ok. Smaller than I thought it would be, blade is sharp, and it is light weight. My biggest complaint or I should say suggestion is that it should be spring loaded. The knife is so small and the thumb pins don't really give you enough leverage to flick the blade out quickly. If it had a spring you could really flick it out fast with the index finger. That's my biggest complaint, would have given it 4 stars if it had a spring!"
3,3 stars,"Over the years, doodles on the Google homepage have made searching on Google more fun and enjoyable for its users worldwide. When doodles were first created, nobody had anticipated how popular and integral they would become to the Google search experience. Nowadays, many users excitedly anticipate the release of each"
3,It's a Small World After All,"Should have paid closer attention to the specs on this. When I opened the box today I was really let down.It is a Gerber though, so it is made very well, like all their products.Many reviewers call this an ""everyday knife."" I suppose that's true for little girls, but believe me, this is not an everyday knife, not in my opinion.Sure it's great for opening a package or getting dirt from under your nails, but not for what I consider day to day to use.Suffice it to say that though it's very well made and seems to be quite durable, it's not very practical.It would be a great gift for a girl/boy scout...or a smurf, but that's about it.50% satisfied."
4,Good knife but ....,"Good knife for home use, but not hard enough, it got a gap when I try to cut a nail, I mean, metal nail."
4,good knife,"Had a Evo but lost it and got a evo Jr. instead. It was a great choice. Does everything I need of the Evo but doesn't take up as much room in my pocket. I guess the only negative is it is easier to lose, but at this price I would definitely recommend. I have never been disappointed with a Gerber knife."
4,A clever and chilling psychological thriller...,"Steven Gage was executed for murdering a vast amount of women. Five years later, Callie Thayer, Steven's ex-lover, receives threatening letters and experiences strange occurrences. Callie hadn't expected the nightmare she now lives. Her daughter and boyfriend might be in danger. The perpetrator has made it clear that it is payback time. Is Steven Gage somehow responsible for said nightmare, or is there something far more sinister going on? There are some chilling and disturbing twists in this novel.The Anniversary is quite a clever thriller. The building of tension is intense -- and the aforementioned tension kept me turning the pages until the wee hours of the night. Amy Gutman has created a wonderful novel full of suspense and thrill rides. I couldn't recommend this novel enough."
2,GAP,"I am a huge fan of Morcheeba, in fact, I bought ""Who can you trust?"" from Amazon.com and have since then been addicted to their sound. They have the modern sound and approach to music, but still offer fresh and unique flavor of their own. However, this album disappointed me and several of my friends who are also big fans of the band. In general, it sounds like 2 seasons of GAP commericals...cheeky and sweet; a little too sweet....like bubble gums! First catchy because it is quite different from the previous 2 releases, but does not have any substance to it.For those of you who have never heard of Morcheeba, please try their first 2 albums first ( I am sure you will be blown away) and listen to the samples of the songs from this album before you purchase. As to the band, if they do read these reivews, keep up your work b/c you ARE so tight, but perhaps stay away from the mass market influence and stay true to your sounds."
2,Fine if you like disco,"I had never bought a Morcheeba album, but what I had heard sounded smooth, inventive, mellow and subtly funky (especially the amazing Blindfold). So when this CD came out I gave it a chance. This was a mistake. The way so much of it borrows from the worst of disco is a bad move. It's supposed to be uplifting, but this type of thing always sounds cheesy. Only the opening track is good in any way. I may still get Big Calm, but fingers crossed the band will not follow this direction long term. Maybe they should have took some valium during its production, because this turned my stomach."
2,Who can you trust? Not Morcheeba.,"Man, I hate to knock fellow artists, but I have to say, COME ON GUYS!! I saw the track ""Rome Wasn't Built in a Day"" in the record store, and I thought, ""Sounds cliche."" But believing strongly in the previous work of this group, I bought the album anyway.I couldn't stomach it. I believe strongly in Artists' Right to Mature and produce an album that I don't get at first. (Hasn't Dylan made a doofus out of everyone at some point?) But this album is all the same textural-musical sound put back together in a very poppy way. I feel almost like they reduced their sound to a formula and applied it to THEMSELVES to make their new record. They made a knock-off of themselves!"
2,Not the Morceeba I knew...,"This should not be taken as an in-depth review of the album, and perhaps I am being unfairly biased. However, I purchased this album expecting the signature trip-hop down-tempo Morceeba sound that they have been crafting for the past few years, and this album deviates quite a bit from that. Just a warning to those wanting a first glimpse of Morceeba or an extension of what they used to sound like -- this album is not representative of their other work. And personally, I much prefer Morceeba's older offerings, such as Big Calm."
1,NO stars is more appropriate,"You've read it before: this is horrible, spine tingling, embarassing stuff! Morcheeba went from making a classic first album (Who Can You Trust?) and a really good sophomore release (Big Calm) to THIS piece of garbage? Unbelievable!As I said in a different review, this album PROVES that the exit of Skye Edwards (after 2002's Charango) had absolutely nothing to do with the demise of Morcheeba, 'cause it really doesn't get much worse than this!Only the title track deserves praise as being really good. The opening track ""World Looking In"" is okay, in that it MAY not give you the chills.But everything else? DON'T BOTHER! There are plenty of less painful ways to inflict misery on oneself: root canal without anesthesia comes to mind as something I'd much rather try than to give this CD another listen."
2,Bye Morcheeba,"I do not really intend this to be a comprehensive review. One sentence can sum it all up: bye, Morcheeba. Huge disappointment. What earns this record two stars, rather than one or none at all, is ""World Looking In"" and ""Coming Down Gently"". And no, this record will not grow on you, I have tried. There are no hidden treasure vaults here, everything is just as shallow and hopelessly mediocre as it sounds from the outset. This record is not simply ""worse"" than ""Big Calm"" or even ""much worse""; it simply eradicates whatever respect, at times adoration, and interest Morcheeba used to be able to provoke.Rest in peace."
1,An ode to the 90's,"How can a group fall as far as they did? ""Who Can You Trust"" and ""Big Calm"" were both classics (dispite the fact that they sounded totally different from one another). Now with ""FoF"" it just went down hill...and never came back!"
2,A Sure Thing Gone Wrong,"I had purchased ""Fragments of Freedom"" looking forward to the quality music I had come to expect from Morcheeba. The flow of ""Big Calm"" that placed them in my heart is, sadly, nowhere to be found on this album.It is definitely more upbeat then their previous albums, yet I feel that it's a style not well suited to their talents. Although the first track, ""World Looking In"", has more frequently been the one coming through my speakers, it all seems just too pushed. The lyrics bring reminders of a certain sense of pop that I didn't think I was getting myself into upon this album's purchase.I suppose change is good for anyone, and I don't deny that right to any artist. Yet, I feel this change was pushed possibly by record label execs trying to reach another spectrum of audiences. Unfortunately, though, I don't seem to be a member of that crowd."
2,"Should have been called ""Fragments of Clichés""","Well, I made the mistake of buying this cd without listening to it first. I normally would do that, but I went ahead and got it solely based on the merits of the group's first two albums. I LOVE ""Who can you trust"" and ""The Big Calm."" I don't know what happened with this effort. Perhaps no *effort* was put into it in the first place?! The music and lyrics are marred with cliché after cliché. Many of the songs seem like a pathetic try at being disco-esque rather than laid back trip-hop. This style just doesn't work here, though it has worked on some recent albums (ie: Beck's ""Midnite Vultures."" I'm sorely disappointed with ""Fragments of Freedom"" and will try to sell it before people realize just how bad it is. If you're interested in Morcheeba and don't have their albums yet, go with the first two. If you already have the first two, save your money and hope that their next album warrants more than two stars."
1,"Morcheeba, A Pop SELL OUT","Yet I can add another name to the list of Pop Music sell outs. I baught this cd expecting Morcheeba to continue there ground breaking trip-hop cd's such as Big Calm and Who Can You Trust? But Fragments of Freedom seem to be just a cheap rip off of Mary J. Blige or Kelly Price. I think this CD is a dissapointment, the lyrics are terribly written and the music seems to sound like any 70's disco song. I urge all Morcheeba fans to not buy this and save there money!"
3,"Okay, so long as you avoid comparing it to other albums...","Overall, a decent album, in my opinion...quite a descent from the profound and fluid sounds they've produced in Big Calm, and certainly far from anything memorable...but decent nonetheless. I certainly don't loathe it to the same extent some of the other reviewers seem to, but I must admit that when put in a rotation with Portishead, Crustation, Massive Attack, et al it almost begs me to dive for the ""Skip Disk"" button on my CD changer.On the other hand, it does make for background music/white noise, especially when you don't want to be distracted by entrancing vocals and thoughtful lyrics...neither of which it has."
2,Don't Bother,"After falling in love with both Big Calm and Who Can You Trust I was excited to hear something new from Morcheba. Unfortunately Fragments of Freedom has rarely been in my cd player after my initial listen. The songs are boring, repetative and the lyrics lack the airy beauty of their earlier work. The album falls flat as it trys to combine rap, steal drum music and the brand of trip-hop that Morcheba does so well. If you've got Big Calm and Who Can You Trust skip this album and get something by, say, Hooverphonic."
5,Don't believe the gripe,"This album is pretty good. Very different, but good. I can understand why a lot of people seem shocked by the change from Trust and Big Calm. The vibe here is very soul/solid gold pop compared to the dark funk of the first two albums. But what struck me by this album is how good pop can sound in the hands of a good band. Morcheeba is mining some of the territory of the Jackson 5 mixed in with late disco and early 80's R&B here, and the result is actually pretty tasty. It has seemed like poppy R&B has been pretty much done to death by Boy Bands and the like. Morcheeba has simply reclaimed some of the genre (without which Trip Hop would have never evolved) and made it interesting again. Pop this one on a good HiFi and enjoy. You may be surprised."
3,Fragments of music.......,"I must say as a fan of Morcheeba I am a bit disappointed in this CD. I can appreciate them trying to go in a new direction from 'Who Can You Trust' and the excellent 'Big Calm' , but the title of this CD is appropriate. Riffs and fragments of pop, dance, rap (not advised ) and some pure bubblegum lyrics kill what I had hoped for in this CD. The poppy 'Rome Wasn't Built In a Day' track is I guess the best if I had to pick one. If you're interested in what they MIGHT have accomplished check out their sultry version of Gershwin's 'Summertime' on the Red, Hot and Rhapsody- The Gershwin Groove collection. Lead vocalist Skye Edwards is more suited for this type of cool jazz. An interesting effort but for pure fans only...."
2,A Disappointment,"I'm afraid I must add my voice to the chorus of Morcheeba fans disappointed by this release. A weak attempt at commercial R&B/Dance, the edge and quirkiness that made their previous recordings so entertaining is almost entirely absent.Here's hoping that Morcheeba have gotten it out of their system, and get back in the groove. It would be a shame to leave so much potential unrealized."
2,"More cheeba, less pop.","I am a huge trip-hop fan and have been following the likes of Massive Attack and Morcheeba since the get-go...this album was a shock! It seems that Morcheeba has gotten off the cheeba, gone to rehab, had their mind filled with tra-la-la thoughts and they documented it by making an album....""you and me were ment to be, walking free in harmony""....give me a break! Morcheeba is not Jamiroquai or Parliment - can't touch that funk...they should stick to what they do best...mello, lounge trip-hop the kind that makes you melt into the chair. They are trying to follow on the coat tails of Macey Gray....bummer."
2,Disappointing Departure,"I often see ratings of one or two stars and think to myself that the reviewer was either a) too quick to judge or b) rates everything in their life as either good (5) or bad (1). But this is an album that I truly believe deserves a 2 star rating. This album is almost a complete departure from either of Morcheeba's previous two albums, and not a good departure at that. The wailing saxophone in the background of a few songs made me squeal. I beg anyone just now entering the ""Trip-Hop"" genre to please consider Morcheeba's other albums, or any Portishead album, but please look past this poppy creation."
5,"Brilliant Album, can't believe all these single stars","I had to write a review casue I couldn't believe all the low ratings. This album is better than Big Calm. These people who give 1 star are like musical snobs. This album is just quality music melodic, inventive, and enjoyable. I think if those reviewers look back now 10 years on and compare with most of the music that has followed especially pop, they would concede how good this album is. No its not a trip hop underground album, its just great music go buy. please don'y listen to these people."
3,"Not for the ""Trigger Hippie"", but worth a listen","To Morcheeba's credit, their effort to explore a new sound is no less than admirable as they continue to move toward another direction compared to their dark and moody downbeat trip-hop brethren. However, it cannot be helped but to expect the funky sensuality they first brought us back in their first album, 'Who Can You Trust', which is still regarded by many as their best album. This smooth sound is almost absent in this album and may be shunned by genre purists. Nevertheless, the group's goal to spread the uplifting and optimistic trip-hop sound is apparent and to many listeners, acheived. Though their sonic style has evolved greatly since 1996, this Morcheeba album is still a Morcheeba album and they've magically made a catchy and somewhat mainstream acceptable album with many noteworthy tracks emanating a very happy atmosphere, to the joy and/or displeasure of their fans."
2,Oh no...doomed to disapointment,"As a huge Morcheeba fan, I almost cried when I heard the newest addtion to the collection. The first song, World Looking In, was OK, it was pure Morcheeba, but from there on...it is like 'bad disco mixed with poser gospel' Oh wow. It sounds like Morcheeba took some prozac and it went horribly awry.I hope their next effort measures up to what all us fans have come to enjoy about Morcheeba."
2,"Oh, how the mighty have fallen...","Having been a fan of Morcheeba since 'Who Can You Trust?' came out way back in the day, I was looking forward to their latest release. After the logical progression they made on 'Big Calm' to more accessible hooks and more mainstream beats, I expected another leap forward in song structure and lyrics. How disappointed I was! They've largely lost that Morcheeba ""atmosphere"" they're known for and their lyrics have become a mere afterthought. There may be two or three tracks that are worth owning here, but much of the rest is actually unlistenable. A major disappointment!"
2,What the . . . . ?!?!?,"Ok, the first two albums were great. Infact, they were better than great, they were greater-er (uh, yeah). Then came this album. Since then, I am afraid to waste my hard earned money on following releases. This album basically sucks (minus the short track featuring good ol' biz). It's like going to a disco on prozac and speed. They were doing great, and then the artistic momentum that they had created all of a sudden stopped. Don't take my word for it, look at the average # of stars it got compaired to previous albums. Simply put, this album bombed."
2,"Sell out, with me oh yeah...","After hearing Big Calm it broke my heart that Morcheeba could do an album like this one. The dreamy, trippy funk of their earlier days is gone, and has been replaced by catered-to-the-masses pseudopop that is, on the whole, flat and shallow. Almost like a critical mother, I have to say about this album, ""they could have done so much better."" Well, hopefully this won't catch on and they'll go back to making good music (fingers crossed)."
1,What happened?!,"This album has one redeeming song, the first one. The rest of the album is a non-sensical combo of rap, disco, and Jamaican steel drum music. It's nearly impossible to get through this album without saying to yourself, ""What the heck were they thinking?"" Their music used to be so dreamy and rythmic. It seems like for this cd, they spent too much time with the cheeba and not enough time writing music."
2,"Starts OK, gets progressively worse","The tracks on this album seem to be arranged in the order of quality, unfortunately in decending order. As a previously devoted fan, I can say that this latest work is really quite depressing. Oh well, maybe next time....."
3,Its Alright,"Definitely different from what I usually listen to. I have yet to hear any of their previous albums but what im reading the majority of folks weren't feeling this one. Overall this one calls for upbeat, kinda funky, goin on a tropical vacation type mood. Personally there were several standout tracks for me mainly the slower songs, ""Shallow End"", ""World Looking In"", and the girl power joint ""Good Girl Down"" featuring one of todays premier female emcees, Bahamadia. I don't competely understand what folks are bitching about, Biz, Mr. Complex and Bahamadia all are established hip hop artists. I dare you all to take a listen *again for some* to some uptempo, funky and positive music. And with todays standards of ""quality"" music nowdays those qualities are always a good thing."
1,Total Letdown,"I would have rated this much lower had it been possible. I highly recommend the other Morcheeba CD's. I'd give five stars to Big Calm. However, this CD doesn't even sound like the Morcheeba I know and love...which is not necessarily a bad thing...but what they have turned into is a total letdown. If you like schlocky Cardigan-esque pop pseudo-electronic music that never changes key or beat, then this is for you. (Did they make this when they were on valium or something?) Otherwise, go buy Maxinquaye by Tricky. I'd even prefer you bought an Eminem album. Anything but this one."
4,"cool, but it's pink","really cool. the kid i bought it for loved it. but, while the photos make the parts look orange or red, they're actually bright pink. so if you're squeemish about buying something that has some pink on it for a little boy, don't get this."

3,The Bonus Track Was Unnecesary,"The three main themes from ""Cinema Paradiso"", composed by Ennio and Andrea Morricone are fabulous and extremely touching. I really love them. However, they are repeated throughout this CD, with the sole exception of 'While Thinking About Her Again', 'Cinema On Fire', and 'Four Interludes'.The main title is best represented on 'Cinema Paradiso' (track 1). 'Love Theme For Nata' is a fantastic nod for the love theme. And the theme for the child Toto is the one that I praise the most, and it's heard on 'Childhood And Manhood', even though it's repeated on 'First Youth'. And I have to say that the bonus track on this CD, which is a version of the theme played by the string section of the orchestra, was definitely unnecessary because it's a repetition of track 1.It's a shame that such a marvelous work from Ennio Morricone gets lost in so many repetitions. One thing that makes this CD attractive though, as opposed to the original release, is that the sound is better recorded."
3,Hit or miss....,"This book is a strange combination of patterns--some very retro, as in things you'd find in old pattern leaflets for items sold at church bazaars, and some cute little novelty items that you might want to knit for your children. If the ""Glam"" in the title was supposed to be short for ""glamorous"", well, those items were not--silly is probably a better description. The knitted grenade is kind of cute, however.The directions were not the clearest, either, and more than one pattern left me wondering why the author chose the more difficult way of doing something--the sponge bag could have been worked circularly, for instance, and the cape could have been worked in one piece with different patterns and then sewn at the sleeves, instead of in several patches requiring sewing up.A real mixed bag--you should check it out of your library first. It may or may not be your cup of tea."
3,Oops,"I deserve the flack for buying this book mainly to complete a set ( I also have Hookorama which I love) and for getting the book for the two or so patterns I thought had some appeal to me. ( I tried researching the book on Ravelry, only 3 patterns were made) I paged through the book when I got it and I remembered why I sat it down the first time. I mainly wanted it for fun clothing peices and I ended up with a lot of really boring poorly constructed trinket items. I can find ways to make it work, but really some of these patterns are just kinda bleh."
