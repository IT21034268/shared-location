2,Redundant,"I found this book to be a slow read. After a while I couldn't continue to motivate myself to finish it. There is nothing really new presented here....just basic economic theories. The most annoying part of the book is how redundant the author is. It takes him ten pages to make his point when it could have been done in one paragraph. I'm sure some people like drawn out stories to help ""paint the picture"", but I found it tedious in this case."
3,Enjoyable but fishy,"Well, when I came here, what caught my attention is that of the first 6 reviews, 5 only have one review to their name (only for this book, all on Nov. 2) and the 5th has 3 reviews , all are other Oxford U Press books printed within the past year. Undercover economics perhaps.That said, this is a good book, not as good as Freakonomics, but well written and a fun quick read. If you have to chose, Choose Frakonomics. If not, this makes a nice addition next to it.And no, I haven't (as of this date) written a lot of reviews."
3,Disagree about secondhand cars,"Harford claims it is nearly impossible to buy a decent used car. He also claims that there is no way for sellers of good cars to ""prove"" their car is a good one.I have found this not to be true at all. If you are buying in a non-snow area such as California, narrow down your search to a make and model deemed most reliable by Consumer Reports, look only at cars offered by individuals (not dealers), find a ten-year-old car whose owner has all its oil-change records, eyeball it to make sure the engine has not been steam cleaned and the chassis is straight and has not been in an accident, get it checked out by a mechanic, and if it passes, buy it and pay the Blue Book price. Such a car will be extremely inexpensive to maintain, and you will save a fortune on insurance."
2,Informative But Dry,"The book does not sustain its promising beginning, turning into dry and flat explanations of economic theory. This book won't tell you anything you haven't already learned in Econ 101.The Undercover Economist seems targeted at ordinary people who may not know much about economics, and as such, it fails miserably. It fails to make its complex ideas easy to understand and fun to read. In that area, Freakonomics has done a much better job.This book is informative but fails to reach its intended audience. Not what I expected after scanning the first chapter."
2,Disappointing,I read Mr. Harford's column in The Financial Times and some are interesting and most are pretty pedestrian as is this book. Nothing really new or insightful here for the informed reader.
2,Socialist Skeletons in the closet,"After getting the impression the author is a liberial with a big ""L"" because he priases the British system of charging drivers a congestion fee. I then read on page 121 ""the Canadian health system, which produces noticeable superior health outcomes."" This changes my opinon from ""L"" to ""S"". I encourage you to buy this book as a way to fund the author's move to a local with a governmental system more to his liking."
1,Climate Change Rant.,"What a misleading title. Got part of the way through it and it just turned into a never ending climate change rant. Ideas were not supported or developed, just asserted over and over. It was like talking to a religious fanatic.I couldn't endure it, it was like a form of torture. Maybe they hand that book out to inmates at Guantanamo Bay"
1,The Undercover Socialist,"This book should have been called, ""The Undercover Socialist"". At first read, there are spatters of interesting economic theories and ideas, but for the most part, it is Harford's half-narrative in favor of socialist policies. He uses economics to reinforce his socialist policies, however, his socialist policies are based on little, if any at all, documented evidence, and sometimes, are flat out lies completely. If you are interested in learning about economics, this is not the book for you. If however, you voted for Barack Obama, and enjoy socialism, this is the perfect book for you."
4,Flawed yet worthy,"Using humorous and applicable examples, Harford manages to bring some complex economic concepts down to a basic level of understanding, similar to Steven Landsburg's book The Armchair Economist. Landsburg's book is a more engaging read, and his writing more precise, but where Harford really shines out is that he manages to keep his book easy to read from page to page, while Landsburg has a tendency to get caught up in confusing technical language and jargon.If you're looking for a good source of some sound (and simple) economic explanation, Harford's book is a great place to start; it's clear enough and interesting enough that you're sure to find what you're looking for."
3,not terrible...,"decent coverage of scarcity theory, and slight coverage of comparative advantage, but not much ground-braking information here. Its not as good as Freakonomics, which I also disliked. I'm still looking for a book on classical economic theory that I can tolerate... any suggestions are highly welcome!"
1,Don't waste your money.,"The aspirator has no suction power and only irritated my son. The nail clippers are not sharp enough to cut a newborns soft nails. I use my own Revlon clipper especially since I am comfortable with the feel of it already. The thermometer is sooo... slow, I get make an educated guess faster. The case is cute and I am sure the medicine droppers are ok...haven't needed those yet. But all in all, I threw half of this kit in the garbage."
4,a lifetime fan of Hampton,"This album is without a doubt the best""live performance"" effort by the Hamp. Considering the average age of the group (72) this rates way up with the best. Of the 6 tracks on the CD, my favorite is Corner Pocket. I've listened to many arrangements of this title (it's one of my favorites) and this one is the best. I like it better than the great Count Basie's arrangement. The other five titles are also great. The side men are some of the greatest players of the last 35 years, ie , Clark Terry, James Moody and Buddy Tate on tenor sax, Hank Jones and Grady Tate.Can't go wrong on this one if you like great jazz."
1,Avoid it Like the Plague,"I have been to concerts where in the flush of the moment I bought a CD by the group. Had I been to this one, I might have been tempted to buy the recording sheerly for the memory of having so many greats together. But the next morning, I would have hated myself. Nostalgia is all well and fine, but this is embarrassing. The first song, ""Corner Pocket"" is like a first rehearsal, dirge-like and totally disorganized. The second, ""Just Jazz' has a few moments of good licks by James Moody, but is otherwise instantly forgettable. The finale, the inevitable, ""Flying Home"" should be called ""Limping Back."" A complete waste of good money."
3,Disappointed,"This book does a good job of listing and describing the various signs and symbols, but the drawings of them are very simple and not always the best examples of the type. As a basic source it does the job, but if you want to see how they are actually used, you will need something else."
4,"Great book, but. . .","This is a great book, but there are no answers to the exercises. I'm learning on my own and I have no way of ferreting out errors. That aside, this book is very easy to use and seems to be very effective."
3,just ok,I bought this specifically to carve cakes as one other reviewer indicated she had good results with this knife for cake carving. I have only used in one time to make a simple diagonal cut for a topsy turvy cake. Not impressed. its almost like it was dull even though it was brand new. I will try again on a future cake. Maybe it needed a warm up cake....
5,Great for cutting cakes!,I use it every time and it does not disappoint. I've had it for months and it still works perfectly. It's a nice addition for any baker.
1,Don't Waste Your Money,An overpriced book that doesn't deliver. If you want to learn about corporate finance don't waste your time reading this one. Buy a book on financial statement analysis instead- you'll get a lot more out of it.
4,good for what it's meant,"this is a good textbook for use in a class. goes over many important concepts including rheology, colloid stability, light scattering, etc, but does so occasionally in a manner that is superficial.i would find this a good book to have sit on my desk for general reference on the subject, where, if the book did not have enough information, i would continue to a lit search."
5,Borla clamps,This was a Christmas gift which was exactly what the person wanted and expected. They have been installed and look great.
2,Not very well researched.,"I was looking for something new and insightful, but all I found was a review of information that has been published over and over. The style of writing left a lot to be desired for a non-fiction work. The author comes across as being pushy, like a 'used-car salesman.'"
2,Was duped by the author's HYPE.,"I was looking for something new, refreshing, interesting. I didn't find it in this book. Rehash of already published information. Very disappointed in the content and writing."
4,Surprisingly good!,"Looking around my boosktore in the hope of just a little enlightenment I came across this unfortumnately-titled volume. Wow! Secret disc aircraft designed since the 1940s, intercepetions of military communications, large triangular platforms and honestly a great assortment of similar information. Maybe there is hope for us all because just when I was beginning to despair this came along like a bolt from the blue."
1,Audio cd's do not operate on a personal computer,"This product does not work on a PC. The King family, Time Warner and IPM should recall this product."
5,Very inspirational,"My parents and I have listened to all the CDs with the greatest enthusiasm over and over again. The quality is pretty good and the speeches are not extracts, but played in full. Barring few, I have found most of the introductions to be very informative and well presented. I am glad this collection includes both of Dr King's most famous ""I have a Dream"" and ""I've been to the Mountaintop"" speeches - I had noticed that most audio tapes include only one or the other, or both in extract form. I would certainly recommend this to anyone interested in great speeches. Also, one may access American Rhetoric website for the transcripts of these speeches to follow with the powerful voice of Dr King."
3,What a disappointment,"We thought this was a ""recording of the century"". After we listened to it, we were so disappointed. Isaac Stearn, Gil Shaham, Sarah Chan.....their recordings all sound better than this one for the Bruch Concerto. Even Joshua Bell's recording sounds better."
3,cd,"Great Recordings Of The Century - Mendelssohn, Bruch: Violin Concertos / Menuhin, Susskind, KurtzMy most favourite ever pairing, I have owned the record for fifty years and just purchased the CD.The box was cracked and the disc appears to jump in a couple of places.Not as good a purchase as I'd hoped.Wonderful music, shame about the disc."
5,review the bad,This album is some of the best new music i have heard in a long time. I have also listen to the first album and they both are tops in my book.
5,Rozhdestvensky and Shostakovich,"I don't know if this recording is the last interpretive word about this sprawling, idea-laden symphony, but it has to be pretty damn close. As I have written in other **Comments** about Rozhdestvensky's Shostakovich, he is never pretty or subtle. I know next to nothing about Rozhdestvensky, but I sense from his readings of Shostakovich, he was not a happy Party member (indeed if he ever joined) or thrilled with the Soviet authorities, but he clearly understand the composer, I believe, in this symphony. This is first-and-foremost a Russian symphony written during the Soviet tyranny and I don't think Western conductors (perhaps with the exception of Ormandy) really cut it open and examined its guts thoroughly like Russian conductors. The Jazz Suite I is a ""fun"" bonus played with spirit and humor. Highly recommended."
5,An excellent read! A must for Deitz fans.,Calvin releases an evil into this world and then has to battle it...the story is engrossing and keeps you on the edge of your seat. You will find yourself hating to put it down. This is one of the best of the series Mr. Deitz had brought to life!
3,A latch and some sandpaper would be nice.,"I bought this product because I love the game and the box that was promised. I love the stain of the wood, but the splinters had to be filed down before I could allow children near it. The instructions were obviously for another model, and the pieces they provide are too big for the box to close. I substituted river rocks. Carvings like this usually cost alot more, so if nothing else, get it for the box."
4,Tecumseh: The Last Warrior,"The video Tecumseh illustrates to us how the whites deeply influenced the Shawnee Indian tribe as well as other tribes also as far as how they suffered and all of the strife they went through. The video portrays to us how difficult it must have been to have some British and American snobs come in and, take everything they wanted. The movie really shows us how life was in 1768 as far as the Indians go."
4,A personal look at a visionary Native American.,"This is a great video for school-age children to learn about the struggle of American Indian tribes to retain their lands and dignity in the face of white American aggression and politics. The film focuses on Tecumseh as a true leader and visionary and the inner struggles within the Shawnees and between the tribes, which ultimately ended their control of North America. The film gives children a good alternative to ""school book history"", which tends to glorify the settlers and vilify the native tribes; sadly, the reverse was true."
4,Great Movie,"I really enjoyed watching this movie. ""Tecumseh"" taught us about the history of our nation through the Native's standpoint.The Shawnee tribe was the movies' main focus and their stuggle to keep their land. If you like war and fighting then you will enjoy this movie for all of it's battles. But, if you are like me and like a good story plot and a tear-jerker you will enjoy ""Tecumseh"" as well. This movie will appeal to all types of movie watchers so be sure to watch it."
2,"Tecumseh, the first attempt","While i thought it was good that the life of Tecumseh wasfinally the subject of a movie, i was disappointed at the narrowness of its scope.Very little of the Native traditions about Tecumseh were included,which means that dreams and visionsthat guided him were not a part of the plot.Also,the characterization of Tecumseh was stereotypically stoic so as to make him seem one-dimensional and historical rather than realand contemporary.Tecumseh deserves a better effort."
5,Orginal PORSCHE 924/944/968,"An absoulte must buy for the 924/944 owner. the book clearly guides you thru all models from 1975 to 1995, including the Turbos. All photographs are in color and the details of each model year are discussed. The book also includes specs and import numbers. Almost all options for each year are listed, a big plus when checking out what came with your car."
5,Brilliant,"This book was an outstanding piece of work. I thank the authors for producing such a master piece. Anyone who speaks wrong of this book, obviously understands little about the skill envolved and the time taken to put a life's work into words."
2,a little disappointed,These did not work well with my cupcake maker. These cups lost its form too easily that just in the process of lifting out my cupcakes would separate the cake from the cups.
1,wilton white standard baking cups,these muffing cups are terrible & worthless.they stick so badly to the muffin that you have to tear the muffin apart to get it out of the cup.i will never buy another wilton product again.
3,Does not work with NTFS...,I bought this item to work on my network and had to return it because it is not compatible with NTFS... Beware... I am giving it 3 stars because it will probably work fine with FAT32.
2,Reads but can't write!,"I've been working on computers since 1992 and can't figure out how to write to anything I attach to this device.The documentation makes it seem simple, but in the end I felt dumb for not being able to get it to do what it promises to do! I thought the device would have a network name and share the device so it could be mapped to as a network drive (\\server\USB_HDD)....nope. All I'm able to do is stick a thumb drive in this device and read it which is something I can do WITHOUT this device! I have owned other TRENDnet equipment in the past and am very disappointed with this. I don't have a very strong understanding of networking but I feel that I should be able to set up a shared resource on my home network without having to take a two year course in the subject!"
4,Damn That's Good,"The track listing they have here is incorrect. The ""Decypher/Fun WIth Drugs"" single has 7 tracks. 2 versions of Fun WIth Drugs, and 5 of Decypher. Actually, you only get one new version of Fun With Drugs, the other is the album version. Still, I think it's an incredible EP, that really demonstrates VAC's programming and musical ability. It's like big fun....in a locked closet...with a razor blade and a bottle of rum."
5,The Easiest Timer Ever,"As a landscaping contractor, I get to use a lot of timers on various irrigation projects. This is the easiest ever for hooking up to a hose. I buy these for my clients to use because they are foolproof."
2,Awkward!,"This timer has no manual override (you cant turn it on and off to position sprinkler for example, or just turn it on to run manually!). There are other timers that are more versatile and useful. And I believe the price is too high for the few features."
3,Claber Watering timer,Decent product--several drawbacks.No way to set the timer for a different time than the time you do it.Intervals should be greater than one hour.I left a previous purchase outside during the winter and it cracked. My fault but I'm having a terrible time getting it repaired. Distributor company is not responsive.
4,Best of the lower end timers,"I've used a number of other brands, and haven't been overly impressed with faucet timers in this price range. The Claber, however seems to work well, does not leak, and has not stopped working after full time duty since the Spring.Pros:DependableQuick release built inCons:Timer is very analogue and does not have a ton of timing options. I actually had to resize my drippers to accommodate the water schedule. The most you can get out of it in one day is 20 minutes (5minx4), but it ranges all the way up to weekly waterings if that's a need."
4,nice product,"This product works great. Bought it for hanging pplants when we go on vacation, and it does come on and shut off when it should. Easy to program."
4,Easy to use,"This timer is well built and has numerous program presets as listed by a previous reviewer. All of these presets begin about 2 seconds after you turn the dial to the new setting. Of course, the amount of water that is actually delivered depends on your water pressure and hose configuration; but for example, I am using this in central NC and so far one of the first 2 settings (Setting 1: 2 minutes every 6 hours; Setting 2: 5 min every 6 hours) seems to provide adequate water for raised bed gardens using soaker hoses."
2,"The portrayal of the way many of the Irish lived and were treated was fairly historical, but the rest was unbelievable","The portrayal of the way many of the Irish lived and were treated was fairly historical, but the rest was unbelievable, the plot was rubbish and unconnected, and also not believable, like they started as ""Shanty Irish"" and ended up cultured in a short period of time, also the cutured English lady is hububbing and romanticizing with the ""Shanty Irish"" to bad such good actors had to be wasted on this debacle.Also , at that period of time, most of the Irish only spoke Gaelic, until they were forced to speak English in their schools, which most Irish weren't even attending at that time."
3,Good in spots but avearge overall.,Not sure of what I expected when purchasing it but it did not hold my attention at some points. Not as good as The Kent Chronicles that I purchased at the same time.
3,Trying Too Hard,"Pierce Brosnan and Kate Mulgrew lead an otherwise lifeless cast in this tale about an immigrant Irishman coming to America. ""The Manions of America"" is sometimes educational, depicting the hardships of Ireland during the potato famine, but history quickly submits to romance between Brosnan and Mulgrew, turning the film into an oveblown melodrama. However, it is a must see for romance viewers and for Brosnan fans who are tired of seeing him as James Bond."
4,Nice clock!,This clock is great. The bad thing is that the hour and minute needles don't light in the dark.
4,Good V-day present.,"I gave this watch to my boyfriend for valentines day and he really wasn't sure about the size at first. But he's worn it daily since then, so it was a successful gift."
4,mini weather station,"Great Thermostat, would like if screen was bigger, but with this T-stat you can use remote sensors for both indoor heat/cool setting and also read the outdoor temp with additional sensors. Very easy to install T-stat and sensors."
3,"Decent, but not the best.","I don't know who puts these things together, but the choices here could be better. It does have ""Shout At The Devil"", ""Home Sweet Home"", ""Girls Girls Girls"", and ""Kickstart My Heart"", BUT where's ""Dr. Feelgood"", ""Smokin' In The Boys Room"", ""Wild Side"", and ""Don't Go Away Mad (just go away)""? I mean c'mon! This collection might be cheap, but go for the legit ""Greatest Hits"" instead, or better yet get ""Decade Of Decadence"" if you can still find that."
3,good music,"The Motley Crue 20th Century Masters CD is full of good tunes, but it does not actually represent the best of Motley Crue. For every hit present, there is one missing.Classics like Shout at the Devil, Home Sweet Home,Girls,Girls,Girls, and Kickstart My Heart are on this CD,but essential Crue tunes like Live Wire,Looks that Kill,Wildside,Smokin in the Boys Room,Dr.Feelgood,Without You are all missing. The songs that are on here are good songs,but due to the fact that so many essential Motley Crue songs aren't on here this isn't really a good purchase for anyone. If you know anything about Motley Crue you'll already know that many of their hits are missing just from looking at the song list,so this CD doesn't really offer anything for diehard fans, or for new fans. For a good introduction to the Crue try to find Decade of Decadence 81-91."
3,I took a ride on the Wild Side,"Besides the other reviews that mention the hits not included : ( so I won't do so now, I personaly miss Wild Side being included on this CD. I hear that song and I flash on the video. Remember the drum solo? So if other songs would of been included this CD would have gotton a higher rating. If you are collecting all Motley Crue stuff, go for it, otherwise, save your money on this collection."
3,What Happened????,"I must say that I am somewhat disappointed by this CD. I love Motley, and I truly believe in the Motley way of thinking. This reviewer does not appreciate the fact that two of the cuts on this CD (Rock 'n' Roll Junkie and Anarchy in the U.K.) have been censored during the remastering process. I thought that was illegal, but who am I??? P.S. I have already been in contact with Hip-O Records about this issue, with no response. Maybe we should go enmasse in order to get a non-censored version of this CD released? Caveat emptor dudes..."
3,I thought it was something else.,"Well I just received the product today. I've bee listening to it again, and there are a lot of other songs better than the included here.Many of them are missing in this CD, why? marketing strategies, maybe...but Motley Fan's always deserve the best....so what happends?"
5,The Best of the Best,"If you have to choose just one album of Motley Crue, buy this one. All of their greatest hits are on it. There is no fillers, no boring songs, no lame balade. There is just the best of the best. The sound is clear and pure, the listing of the songs is perfect. Nothing bad to say about this album.Decade of Decadence was great. But this album is a far better choice. It is the retrospective of a twenty years career. This album is really the best of Motley Crue!Don't hesitate and buy it!"
4,Hendricks Finally Begins to Show His Age a Little,"If anyone else had done this album, I might rave. But this is the man who brought us all of those quintessential LH&R albums from the '50's and early '60's, and the vastly superior ""Freddie Freeloader"" a mere 3 years prior. Jon shows his age on this a bit, never more apparent than on ""One O'Clock Jump."" There's no way a 75-year-old Jon Hendricks is going to recreate the subliminal mood of ""Sing a Song of Basie"", especially without a young Annie Ross, and it was a mistake to try. Best cut on this was ""Roll 'Em Pete""--basically because the other musicians could stretch out and jam around Mr. Hendricks. He'll still go down in history; just not with this."
3,ermm....this wasn't recorded in the fifties,"If Wynton Marsalis was playing trumpet in the fifties that would make him some kind of weird non-existent hindu prodigy who made a mad deal with Satan, in order to be born to Ellis Marsalis 10 years later. (Wynton was born in 1961) As stated above, this album was recorded in the nineties, though I'm sure that doesn't detract from its ""tubed"" equipment enjoyment."
5,Mile Marker: Songs and Stories from the Acoustic Highway,"This DVD has it all....Great musician, great music, humor, material previously unreleased. I would recommend this DVD to anyone who enjoys Edwin McCain's music. The take on MTV's The Crib is hilarious. For old and new fans this DVD gives you a well rounded taste of Edwin McCain, the singer, the song writer and the person. Very enjoyable, I only wish it were longer."
4,Edwin behind the music.,"When I purchased the DVD, I had no expectations. I was hoping for a live concert, but was pleasantly surprized to get a glimpse of Edwin behind his music. Not only is he a great songwriter/singer, he is a great human being. His music had already won me over, but his humor seal the deal. This DVD is a great addition to my growing collection of all things Edwin."
2,"Quaint, simple tale of an earlier era",Might be good for someone interested in early automobile history. A lot of mechanical descriptions of the Ford Model-T will be liked by anyone mechanically-minded.
3,Inaccurate terminology regarding some of Byzantium's neighbors,"I noticed that author sometimes uses wrong names for ""Rus'"" and ""Kievan Rus'"": ""Russia"" and ""Russian"". In fact, Russia was one of the colonies of Rus' (now Ukraine)."
5,Real Heroes,"This is a Great book that every patriotic American should read. I served in Viet Nam and our group is a much greater group of veterans than we will ever get credit for. The ultra left media and Hollywood has blasphemed us unjustly for years. Thanks to Mel Gibson for making ""We Were Soldiers"" also."
4,POW's Today,"The book was quick to read and the type was easy to read. There were numerous photographs and reasonably good writing. The POW issue is one everyone should be aware of, especially since there were so many men left behind and so many returned POWs who are living witnesses to that fact. Most of these men who survived and returned home have gone on to live active and productive lives."
2,JWIN Mega Bass Headphones,"I wasn't please with this product. It didn't provide the ""mega"" bass that I was expecting. The sound quality is clear. So, for the price. I can't complain too much."
4,Muy Caliente,"The women in this video are almost without exception very beautiful and alluring. The production values are quite high, and the video usually focuses on the seductive and erotic form of the women rather than corny situations. One notable exception is a nude basketball game between two Puerto Rican women which is more silly than it is sexy. However, overall this is a good buy."
4,Very Hot Latin ladies !,"Hot, Erotic and sensual! Yes! That's it! This is Playboy video! Girls not being shy to show all of their 'details' and directors driving the camera lens right in, for our pleasure ! The ladies are one better than the other, all of the genuine Latin type. Sensual, curvy, with that 'sun tan' color skin that drives me wild as well as hairy in the correct amount and places! I enjoyed this video as much as I expected."
2,Lukewarm Latin ladies,"This was big letdown. The women are not that great looking. The video sequences are very cliched and not original at all. The only two scenes that stand out feature a Puerto Rican girl filmed at South Beach and the strange, sexy party towards the end of the video. That last sequence is particularly strange and stays away from the usual Playboy video idea."
3,"Not as good as The Sanity Annex, but still great music","If you're looking for another Sanity Annex, this is not the album. This is simply an EP of remixes, singles, and instrumentals to tide you over until their next full length. That said this is excellent music and if you are a Sum fan you will enjoy this album. If you are new to Sonic Sum I suggest you pick up The Sanity Annex before you pick up this release. Ultimately from the group dubbed ""Hip-hop's Radiohead"" this is not up to par with their other material. But for an EP it is definitely solid music."
1,Re-Veiling Islam,"""The Destruction of the Veil of Islam"" by Larry Garza is the first book that I have read that really doesn't have a ""plot"" or story-line. The author is a Christian `missionary' who during the 1990s traveled throughout Central Asia & China and revealed that from time-to-time he thought that he had converted someone to Christianity. Virtually every time he entered a new city or country he started to give some informative tidbit about that area, but before he sort of concluded his remarks he started talking about some other topic; a very disjointed work. Sorry, but I just can't recommend this book - there is just nothing of (great/minor) substance to be learned regarding Islam from it; I recycled it."
1,Dont Read This,"I would ask anyone who wants to know about Islam to not read this book. This guy has no idea what he's talking about. I saw him on the O'reilly Factor and he made a fool of himself. I am muslim. I know about Islam. Nothing this guy said made any sense and he had all his facts wrong. Books like this are destroying America. Instead of this book, read Inside Islam"
5,Perfect Fit,I went and got sized at a bridal store but found this one was cheaper online. It's nice thick quality and it fits me perfectly to the same size that they recommended in the store. I ordered this on the 7th and received it on the 11th with regular shipping and the customer service was very nice. Awesome place to shop!
2,NOT WHAT I EXPECTED,"This book is not as well written or intresting as I expected. The title ""A Developmental Analysis of Cuba's Health Care System Since 1959"" is misleading. MacDonald does not explain the diffrent policies or programs that have been implemented by the Cuban goverment. This book focuses more on the Cuban people's attitude and less on the actual development of the Cuban Health System. This book was published in 1999 and yet has statistics from 1988 and 1990, it is outdated. If you are intrested in the Cuban Health System I recomend Dr. Carmelo Mesa-Lago."
4,My Review of Deluxe Swindle,Swindle is a cool figure but not the best.Hasbro did not give him a real head.His head looks like a camera and his feet look like a goat but still i reccommend him
2,Better for older kids,"I ordered this for my 3-year old, since he likes these kinds of toys. I didn't realize how complicated these are to transform (I still haven't figured it out, need to read the directions). The first thing that happened is the car doors popped off - maybe they are supposed to, I don't know. I'm sure a child who is a little older could figure it out in about a minute, but not good for the younger ones."
1,Real fans hate this piece of crap,Just another way to profit from the film. You never see this guy in the film Swindle was a Combaticon whose transformation was a jeep with an earth shattering cannon not a freaking hot wheels knock off. Stay true to the fans for Heaven's sake.
1,Damaged Product,"I ordered three Citronella buckets in three different colors. I received three yellow, badly dented and rusted buckets."
1,Disappointed,"My daughter wants Strawberry Shortcake as a theme in her bedroom.We live with my mom and dad. He's willing to buy her a mattress, but he wants to buy a full, or a queen. So, you can see my perdicament. I'm going to go with the full size canopy bed. If Strawberry Shortcake is available in full size please let me know.However, I believe there will be a lot of themes I won't be able to use, and I'm not going to write a message everytime I can't purchase my size.So, I guess you now know why I'm so disappointed. Even though I know she's going to love what I do decide to buy. I just wish I could also go with the strawberry short-cake theme to start, because I'm sure she's going to be disappointed about that as well. Sincerely,"
4,Great music!,"Definitely a worthwhile pickup! The only thing holding this one back from 5/5 is too much overlap with the band's previous studio release, ""Level"". That said, it does capture a great moment in time for a band on the move. Eli & Young nail their performances of So Close Now, Everything Is You, and Highways And Broken Hearts. Just those three make this one worth owning."
4,A delight,"This book is delightful. Every pattern has clear and beautiful color pictures and both written and picture patterns to show how the piece was done. I'm a needle tatter, not a shuttle tatter that the book is written for, and I was still able to use many of the patterns, and use them as inspiration to create my own. It's wonderful to see this old art being re-imagined and updated to suit modern tastes and uses.I make needle tatted jewelry and you can see my blog here: [...]"
5,"Love, love, love this book!","I can't say enough good things about this book. It's chock full of beautiful designs ranging from the simple to the elegant. Anything from a simple pair of earrings to doilies with everything in between. The author even shows new twists on old ideas, such as flowers and designs on greeting cards. If this book doesn't spark the imagination of new and experienced tatters alike, I don't know what will.Hopefully, seeing it on the store bookshelves (I actually saw it in a craft store the other day) will inspire a whole new generation of tatters."
5,Nice Selection of Small Motifs,This book has a great selection of small motif patterns with ideas on how to utilize them. A fun collection of patterns. Very much enjoying this book.
3,cute but melts in th dryer,"I purchased this bedding for my 2 year old daughters' new ""big girl bed"". It was very cute and she loved it. The first time that I had washed it, it melted in the dryer leaving hard spots and holes. None of my other clothing / bedding has been damaged so I don't believe that it is my dryer. Because it is now unusable, my daughter is very upset that she can't sleep with ""cake""."
2,Could have used a more Catholic perspective,"When I first heard about Matt Talbot I was fascinated. This was a saint I could relate to! An ordinary working-class man who substituted his daily struggles with devotion and study. But when I started to read this book, I grew a bit dissapointed. Matt Talbot was Catholic, and the author of this book is Catholic, but the book seems to be written from a more generic Christian perspective (minimize discussion of Mary, etc), possibly in an attempt to be more ""ecumenical"". I can understand the idea of appealing to a wider audience, but it was a little disappointing. Overall this is not a bad book, just not as good as I was hoping."
3,Renewal,"Pierpoljak has renewal with others tendencies, in ""Je Blesserai Personne"" explore differents rhythm at the reggae root. However, I think that it is good. To the reggae lover ""Je Blesserai Personne"" could be a little disappointing. I hope that the next production of Pierpoljak will be more reggae."
4,Much better than bare hands,"An experienced user can detach Powerlinks and similar chain master links by hand (excluding the newer 10 speed ""permanent"" type) but it is a difficult and messy job, especially on a dirty, greasy chain. I'm partial to the Wipperman Connex connectors and this tool works very well on them, as well as the SRAM links. I have not yet tried it on the new SRAM 10 speed black links, but suspect it will work on them as well. They are impossible to open by hand.All in all, a good addition to my bicycling tool box."
4,Does its job,"It makes dealing with master links easy though how much easier than by hand, I dunno. I use this on my tandem recumbent trike when we adjust the chain length for different sized riders."
3,Seriously,"This tool doesn't need to be precision or solidly built for what it accomplishes. It works great, but so would a five dollar cheapy. Come on China, you could copy this for practically nothing."
4,Park Tool MLP-1 Master Link Pliers,"The pliers work great. Without them, it is difficult to disconnect the master link on the SRAM chains. With this tool it can be done instantaneously. However, be careful not to pinch your fingers while squeezing the master link when applying pressure. With that caution in mind, the procedure is almost effortless. another great idea from Park Tools. Shipping went without a hitch."
5,master link pliers,"These pliers feel sturdy and very well made. I was concerned that it was constructed cheaply and would break after a short time, but this if definitely not the case. It works perfectly and should last a long time."
2,VERY Difficult with a 10 speed chain,"The arms are too wide to fit in a 10 speed chain. You can get it to work, but Park Tool needs to update the design."
1,night optics usa K2 Pro,Right out of the box the light did not work. Tried new batteries and still did not work. So I returned the light and demanded a refund witch i have never received. I will never buy from here again.
1,What a waste...,"I just caught this film on TV...Interestingly enough it is airing as Lindsey's current film tanks at the box office and she faces building legal trouble after arrest. Can someone explain to me why in that past few years so much money has been wasted on building this spoiled girls career. I have yet to see the brilliant talent she was ever hailed to have had. Aside from that, this film is trite, cliched, and pandering to any audience that may concede to view it. I am glad I never paid to see this either in the theater or rental. It is clear that an unoriginal idea was mildly revamped and poorly directed to be a cash flow vehicle for its star; even working in a music aspect to push that side of a career for Miss Lohan. What a mess it turned out to be."
1,horrible!!!!!!!!,i hated this movie. there was no plot. the only good thing about the movie is the wardrobe. the acting was bad and the casting was even worse. the setting makes you feel depressed. lohan's only intrest is a stupid cheesy rock band. overall the worst movie ive seen this year!!!!
2,Lohan is wasted,"This movie is a mess. Lohan's Lola is as annoying as the stereotypical villian of the movie. The real shining star is Alison Pill, and her characer Ella."
4,Cute,What you'd expect out of a teen chick flick. Made me smile. Lindsey did a pretty good job playing a drama queen.
4,Life is Drama,"Once upon a time I had a daughter. Then one day she had opinions about everything. And suddenly she became dramatic. Because I like irony and sarcasm, I bought Drama Queen. My daughter felt that she was finally understood and we lived dramatically ever after.This movie is fun and funny, and just the right amount of Disney cheesiness mixed with the 'I'm not really sure why I like her' charm that Lindsey once had. (You know you still watch Parent Trap if it happens to come on.) If you like a little mindless laughter that you and your girl youngins can enjoy...then let the Confessions begin."
4,"Another ""I'm-a-Loser"" Movie!","This movie is about a girl who moves out of town. There's a lot of trouble in her new city! I saw a little bit of this at my cousin's house. I could tell that this is a ""I'm-a-Loser"" movie 'cause you should've seen the way Lola crashed into that tree! Another reason is that she accidentally knocked over ALL of the gym lockers! And the part I just don't understand is that running scene in the hallway. Two of the girls bumped their hands on a door. But they act as if they bumped with their heads!! Then they walked away. Then one of the girls just opened the door!!"
2,SHALLOW NONSENSE,"Unless you'e a teenager and I am not, this movie is really little more than a vehicle for then-hot Lindsay Lohan to prove she could sing and capitalize on her girl next door persona effectively launched with FREAKY FRIDAY. But even talented Lohan can't save this one.All of the characters are vapid, shallow and not entirely likeable. The story puts them in positions of stupidity involving Lohan's obsession with a rock star (nicely played by Adam Garcia). There's not a teen cliche missing, and only Carol Kane as the dotty Drama teacher made me laugh. A really pointless movie."
2,don't understand...,"this movie is really lame. Mary this character is ok, but Lohan is pretty annoying. The rock band sucks, New York sucks, story sucks, music sucks. damn... I even heard a Simple Plan song in it. Nope!"
3,i will give this 3 in a half stars,i could not see confessions of a teenage drama queen when i saw it i was a little dissapointed but i guess it was ok.
2,ok,i dont like lindsay to much but this movie wasnt that bad....just kinda boring...bought it anyway (well before i saw it).....
1,Are You Kidding Me?,"This is completely hopeless and rediculus! There is a movie each year about a zero becoming a superstar and it's just stupid. Like I put for Catch That Kid, it's not about pleasing the crowd anymore, it's complete and total publicity! Let's have everyone open their tiny brains and look at whats happening! They're sticking your money down the toilet and you don't give a dang! Take it from me, soon no one will go to the movies because of this helpless repitition."
3,funny but corny,hey my name is charlene I think it is corny because it was likea cartoon are they trting to be funny because it was really cornyand I think it is fuuny because athe end carla the witch falls insome water and I think overall the movie was great film andI HOPE it comes out ond dvdover and outcharlene
1,Awful,"Too bad we can't rate this a zero. What a bad movie, there was no plot at all. I also don't see what the fuss about Lindsay is, she was a cute actor as a kid but she is terrible in this movie."
3,"OK, but not the best","I have to admit, it was kind of boring and confusing. If you like Lindsay Lohan, watch Mean Girls. This one is OK, but I probably wouldn't watch it again."
2,Total Upset,"At first when I saw the previews in the movie theater, I thought, OMG ( Oh my gosh!) I have 2 see this movie! It looked so cool. But, I never had any time 2 go and see it. So when it came out on DVD and VHS, I rented it. And boy was I glad it was only a rental. About 15 minutes through, I was like, this is soooooooo boring! I was very upset because the whole entire movie is just about a girl making this big fit about moving. She is a major baby and lies alot. She says her dad died, when he really didn't!!!!!!!!This was like Napoleon Dynomite. Just another stupid waste of time movie. Please, don't waste ur money on this!"
3,Low on the Totem Pole,"Lindsay Lohan is a very good actress, but she is stuck in a role that lacks depth and a plot that wasn't really a plot. Aside from a great title, the book/film did not have much confessions, nor much drama. It consists of Lohan's character competing with the reigning popular girl to become the lead in the school musical. Not one of Lohan's better works, but it did get her more attention than the much better Freaky Friday where she was convincing as her mother. Mean Girls was better than Confessions, but Freaky Friday was the best so far."
2,Lizzie McGuire meets MK&A,"What can I say? When I was 12, I read the book and loved it. I leant it to my friends and they loved it. We were glad when we heard the movie came out. But we were dissapointed. What could have been an excellent movie was wreaked by the animated scenes, and the focus on the rock concert because she has a crush on the lead singer. Carla Santini was portrayed as being just a little mean when in the book she's much more.The book, had the movie been faithful to it, could have been as good as Mean Girls but right now it's just the Lizzie McGuire movie meets New York Minute, all played by Lindsay Lohan wearing feathers and a head scarf. I though that the girl who played Ella did a good job but Lindsay Lohan was just somehow out of sync when everything was going on. Hey, maybe I got so attached to the book that I just expected to much. But I recomend the book far more highly, if you're over 11. Happy viewing."
4,Check it out,"I thought this was a good movie, there was good music and dancing. Although in my theater there was only 2 people laughing at the funny parts me and the friend i was with. I would totally go see it if you like music, dancing, and plays."
1,It is dramatic...,"I went in with an open mind and sat through, hoping it would get better, but this is the ONLY movie I have ever seen where I have wanted to walk out of the theater. For maybe the only positive messages they have in the movie (follow your dreams and don't lie to your best friend) there are so many negative ones. Be catty to other girls, make it one of your top dreams to meet that famous person, do what feels right to you regardless of what it means to other people, give in to stereotypes about teen girls just do it more extremely than the other people and you'll be different, it IS all about you and everything you want will come true! Everything was taken to such an extreme in this movie (it is dramatic) and as a pretty laid back person, I couldn't deal with it. I can see how young girls would be attracted to this film, but I personally didn't like the pointless drama and self-involvement of the main character. I wish I had taken the title more seriously."
1,In my opinion,I saw this movie recently and and about 10 minutes into it I turned it off. I think this was the worst movie ever. The commercials made it seem so good. Boy was I fooled.
2,Confessions....this movie has no Drama,"I really liked Lindsay Lohan in Feaky Friday. I rented this movie, hoping it would be as good, but this movie is bad. Lohan usually plays a likable character in her movies...but her character has a posh attitude that makes you not care what really happens to her. The whole movie seems surreal, and it gave me a headache. I had to stop watching the movie after 30 mins. There was no real plot, it was going in too many directions. I didnt care what happened to her character, but more concerned about the money I paid for the rental. ***I recommend ""13 going on 30"" (starring Jennifer Gardner), it is alot deeper, warmer and leaves you feeling it was worth your time watching it.***"
1,More like Confessions of a Teenage PANSY PRISS,"Please, STOP with garbage like this and ""Lizzie McGuire""... if you want a good classic Disney flick check out ""Flight of the Navigator""!"
4,Not bad piece of fluff,"I have to admit I enjoyed this movie. I resisted renting it for a long time because I really didn't think it would be something I would enjoy. I loved the way Lindsay Lohan's dialogue was so in keeping with being a ""drama queen."" How many other movies can use the line ""the best poet since shakespeare"" that many times? I was a little disappointed in Carol Kane's performance, but a lot of that was because I know how good she can be. All in all, this was an enjoyable movie, as long as you aren't looking for an Oscar caliber movie."
2,Feh..,"Its a bland cliche tween movie. Its starring Lindsay Lohan who should be ashamed of being in this monstrosity. Dont buy it, its not worth the money. This is definately a rental. Even my 13 year old cousin who is a HUGE Lohan fan thought this movie was bad. Stay away."
2,Watch Freaky Friday!,"1.)Trust me, this movie is not worth your time. I almost fell asleep half way through 'Confessions...'.2.)Lindsey Lohan plays a girl who loves acting + is OBSESSED with this rock boy band called Sidarthur.3.)I expected this 2 be as good as 'Freaky Friday' but it most definetly was not.4.) The dvd includes Lindsey's 'That girl' song. It's AWFUL AWFUL, from her terrible voice right down to her 'rapping' (HOW EMBARRASING!!!)5.) This junk wasn't even worth my rental money!!!! AVOID AT ALL COSTS."
1,Horrendous,"This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen, and I would consider myself a Lindsay Lohan fan. Its just amazing how bad this movie is. Please do not buy it."
2,Could it get any more predictable?,"This was not a movie I was looking foward to see. Nothing from the previews looked appealing to me. I wasn't planning on going to see the movie until I got stuck bring my pre-teen sister and her friends to see it.It's basically about a girl who moves to New Jersey from NYC and hates it because she feels she can't become a big star in New Jersey. She also loves a rock band who is breaking up, and it is her mission to get to their final concert. These two things together make up the story of the movie.The problem with this movie was that it was so predictable. There wasn't a single scene in the movie where I thought ""I didn't think that would happen."" If you see one of the Disney Movies that they have been coming out with lately geared towards pre-teen girls, you've seen them all.I think you could find something better to spend your $6.00 on instead of seeing this."
1,Confessions of a teenage groupie,"I'm one of those people who loves bad movies. I mean i love BAD movies. Bad chick flicks i am totally in to. But this movie was by far the worst chick flick/kid's movie i've ver seen! The girl in it completely idolizes a rocker to the point that she LIES to her parents, and then MANIPULATES them with passive aggressive dramatics to go to a party in which he is completely wasted. Any parent would not let their kids near a potiental rapist of a drunken rock star. And in the end he returns her necklace and says ""you left it at my place"" and all of a sudden she is cool? What are the implications there??? Bad bad bad. Should be banned by parents everywhere for the terrible role model this character is! and if you're thinking that i'm some mom who is appaled think again, i'm a young girl who is too smart for this foddery that hollywood keeps pushing out like candy from a giant pez dispenser. Too sugary and bad for the brain."
3,"Decent family-oriented fare, could have been better","This is the type of movie that belongs on TV. Lindsay Lohan is multi-talented and charismatic as ""Lola"" who feels like a fish out of water when her mom moves from NY to NJ. She wants to be the drama queen in more ways than one, and engages in making up stories to impress peers in her new town. The drama instructor character is a bit annoying, and the battle for acceptance among teenage girls is becoming a cliche. The music in the film is OK (Lohan sings multiple songs, and this movie features another cover version of Bowie's ""Changes,"" recently included in Shrek 2) while the whole storyline about Lola and her not-dead dad and the Sid-Arthur concert are like something from a TV comedy show or TV movie. This movie is aimed at a young audience and it shows. That said, this movie is fine for what it is, but it could have aspired to more, especially at the end where things are wrapped up too quickly."
3,Just Okay,"This was not a bad movie. It just wasn't a great movie. The story is cute and formulamatic. It is a no brainer. I just can't help thinking there could have been something more. The depiction of high school girl's obsessions with superstars was humorous and right on. Still I don't think I ever really liked Lola, the main character. I didn't find myself rooting for her to win. I didn't really care what happened though I predicted it early on.If you are in the mood for light and fluffy fare this movie is for you. If you are looking for a movie that says something this is certainly one to avoid."
2,Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen- a total let down,"I was very excited to see this movie because of Lindsay Lohan's excellence in her other films. I think that they tried to make it kind of like Lizzie McGuirre with the little animated scenes. The movie did not really explain the plot. Lindsay meets a guy at her new school and than, in the next sceene she is like best friends with him. The movie also did not explain why she kept on lying. I mean, she lied to her new friend about her father. She said that her father was killed in a motor cycle accident when really her father and mother got divoriced. Overall, Lindsay's acting is good, but the movie does not explain anything and has a very weak plot. I am a Lindsay Lohan fan... but I am not a big fan of this movie. In my opinion, her other films are much, much better!"
1,typical Lindsay Lohan flop,"the only reason i bought this movie was because the cover is cute. i TRIED to watch it with an open mind and TRIED to like it. after all, what's the point of owning a movie you don't even like?lindsay lohan's character is too over-the-top. i understand that she is SUPPOSED to be that way in the movie, as she is a DRAMA QUEEN. however, she does not pull it off well.there is a plot, i can give them that.but the movie was just very lame.please save yourself time and DON'T watch it!the ONLY lindsay movies worth watching are ""Mean Girls"" and ""Parent Trap""."
3,Somewhat Inappropriate for Younger Audiences,"The movie was a good flick, but I'd not reccomend it for younger audiences. This movie is a bit more inappropriate than what most Disney films are.Let's see, where should I begin? Ah, yes...around the heart of the movie Mary ""Lola"",(Lohan),and her new friend Ella find the lead singer of their favorite band,drunken in an alleyway near where the band's farewell concert is about to start.I think Disney went a tad too far with this film. If you ask me, I think it should be at least PG-13 instead of PG."
3,Not Lindsay's best movie out there,"I started to like Lohan when I saw Freaky Friday and then when I saw Mean Girls. Both movies made me laugh pretty hard. So I had good feelings about going ahead and buying CoaTDQ, and I wish I had just rented it. There were some ok funny parts in this movie, but most of this movie was ..well..steered more to the young teenagers. Mean Girls made me remember high school, while CoaTDQ made me think I should be in high school to be watching it. Give it a rent at the least though and give it a try...especially if you are a Lohan fan."
5,it rox,"15 year old mary elizabeth cep- or lola has to move to a dull city called dellwood, or 'deadwood.' while trying to get her mom to say yes to letting ella and her go to sidhartha's farewell concert and party, while also dealing with carla santini, the popular, school witch. Lola meets the lead singer in Sidhartha while he's drunk, and helped him through that night! his name is Stu Wolfe, and he wanted to meet lola's dad.havnt seen the movie, but read the book.hint- sam and lola dont get together in the book. sam creek was just the punk kid."
4,Lindsay Lohan knows how to act!,"When I walked into the movies it was either this movie or Starsky and Hutch so i pikced this one because Lindsay has hilarious in The Parent Trap, I made the right choice. This movie was not as good as Mean Girls (This movie is semi- Mean Girls) Well when you have Disney promoting it what do you expect!It is a good movie for preteen girls! It's fluffy a little too fluffy but it works well in the end. Overall pretty good movie but still Mean Girls is better"
1,Worse movie I have seen in a long time,My daughter is a big Lindsey Lohan fan. She missed seeing this at the theater and when it came out on DVD she wanted to buy without seeing it first. She just knew Lindsey Lohan couldn't make a bad movie. Me being the practical mother suggested we rent the movie first. Boy she was was glad she listened to mom this time!! Don't waste your time nor money on this one!
1,Unreal.,"I was completely open to this movie this afternoon when I ordered it on PayPerView. Now, it may be my age, 26, but this movie was horrible. I thought it would be at least charming, but this movie was completely bogus. Instead of me paying $3.95 to view it, I should have been PAID to watch this movie for the whole 87 minutes it lasted. Not a good movie at all.. it definitely won't be winning any awards. Unreal!"
1,boring...,"This is a boring movie. At about 5 minutes through the movie, I was listening to music. Don't get this. Very boring. zzz........"
3,"Okay, ...poor Lindsay...","I am a big fan of Lindsay Lohan and Dyan sheldon (the author of the book this movie was based on), but this movie was rather dissapointing. It's about a creative, imaginative and dramatic Lola (or Lying Lola, as her nickname is)who moves from the wonderful NYC to a drab and rather dull surburb in New Jersey. Things heat up when she gets caught in her lies and her and her best friend, Ella, try to sneak away to a concert and find the band's lead singer drunk and alone. I won't give the rest away!! I bought it and I do like it, but the cast was no match for Lohan. Rent this movie before you buy, that's a must."
2,This is my confession...,"This movie is quite confusing, and even though it is shot at teenagers they shouldn't have to be this confused. I enjoyed all of Lindsay Lohan's movies (The Parent Trap, Mean Girls, Freaky Friday) but this one is appalling. In my standards all of her films pass with flying colours (especially Mean Girls) butthis is just wrong. The movie follows like 3 different plots:1. Lohan moving away from home and trying to fit in2.High school3. Meeting a rock starI mean what was the point ot 3 plots in such a simple movie. In the high school plot it tries to follow one similar to Mean Girls but fails miserablly. The first hour is a waste but the second half is OK. Go buy one Lohans other movies instead of buying this."
5,I love this movie,"I really loved this movie, it was cute and over all very funny. Lindsay was great in this movie, it made me cry. I loved how lola was telling about her parents and about that guy (forgot his name) I'm going to get the book and the soudtrack. I recomended this movie to any ages."
2,My Confession: This Movie Was Terrible!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Lola is not your average girl. With outragous clothing and views, she's anything but ordinary. She doesn't quite fit in at her new school in a new town. When she hears tthat her favorite band is having one final concert, she is determined to be there, but is met by a wacky turn of events.I found Lola a terrible role model. That would be fine if it weren't that she is the hero. I sincerely hope that no young, inpressionable people view this movie. Lola is self centered and wants to stick out, but when you think about it she's really not so unique.The music was pretty good, but If you want to hear it, purchase the soundtrack, you don't have to suffer through the movie like I did."
1,This shoe is not good for narrow feet.,I have a narrow foot and these were supposed to be narrow but weren't. I returned them immediately. I have other Ros Hommerson shoes that fit very well but these did not meet those standards. I returned them immediately.
4,strange material,This saddles are very comfortable and look nice. They are supposed to be leather but they don't feel like it and I am not sure what they are made of. But for 14 dollars whose to complain.
3,Narrow Foot,I have a narrow foot and the AA fits ok. Well made shoes. I am not too crazy about how high they come on my ankle but I knew that when I bought them. Thought I would give them a try.
2,HELP!,"I bought this in December. I cannot seem to get all the features to work and the book that came with it is pretty much worthless. I have looked and looked online for help and haven't found any. I am able to download music to it, but that is about it.(bmlrrrc@clearwire.net_"
2,"Some nice explanations, NOT ENOUGH EXAMPLES","I am not a student at UMD, but took a class there over the summer which used this textbook. While it is a nice book with some helpful explanations, there are just not enough examples. The problems it gives are very difficult if you've never seen a similar problem worked on, and the textbook just doesn't work through enough problems to properly teach technique. If this is required for a class, I guess you have to get it. Just remember that you'll still have to go to class. Don't buy it just to learn the stuff on your own. There are better books for it."
2,Obtuse,"I haven't met Dr Mayergoyz at the university yet, but I did have a class with Wes Lawson. This is not a good introductory textbook, as things are taught backwards. I feel as though this course may be too academic as opposed to 'lets just look at the circuit and think about it for a second'. You don't need to be told about volume current densities and whatever other EE fundamentals there are -- we get plenty of that in device physics and E&M.;Don't buy this unless it is required for your course."
2,Cut-Scenes and Blocky Graphics,"If you want to sit through 1000 horrible cliche' cut-scenes then this game is for you. Every ten seconds the game becomes a pointless movie and you are either stuck watching or forced to skip thru which thank god is an option. Either way the momentum of play has been shattered, and your x button is worn out. What's worse is that none of the scenes contain critical info, they are just there for the ""art"" of it.. The save points? forget it, you better not die or youre all the way back to the prologue, A collosal waste of time.The graphics are blocky and colorless except for bleak bleak bleak brown and gray. Max is a really Unlikable character. He's boring and lame. Bullet time is good, but combined with the auto aim, it makes the game to easy. Killing becomes over simplified. Except for a few dynamic points for gun play, and an engine that allows you to kick a cardboard box or garbage can and slide them across a room nothing else really gets my attention."
3,NO AUTO SAVE,Saving takes a long time. They need to release these PS2 classics on the PS3 like they did with God of War 1 & 2.
4,"Awesome,but...","I think this game should have a ""Warning adult content"" on the front cuz sum 7-year old is going to buy it and thier parents will get upset cuz they thinck its sum game for 7-yr.-olds but its not.But who care(s)!This game is awesome!Mona is so ****ing hot!"
1,TERRIBLE,Who would even think about such a sad sick game like this. The first game was horrible these games should be band. Who would want to play games about murdering babies. People who like games like this make me sick and dont deserve a Ps2.
3,"OK, but very repetitive and very difficult","Not what I expected it to be. It becomes more and more difficult as you play, to the point where the fun just stops. Quite repetitive. Repetitive is one thing, but repetitive and extremely difficult was a bit too much for me. I figure I may have gotten just past the half way point. Where she and Max are fighting together and you are controlling her and after many many hours of trying I couldn't keep Max from dying. Just simply too repetive and difficult for me to enjoy. If you're an extreme die hard at finishing games you may *ENDURE* it. Believe me, that's what you'll be doing from start to finish. I enjoyed the first Max, but the second is simply tooooo much."
2,Far worse than the first one...,"There is a reason that this game earned paltry, failing grades from GameSpot (6.5) and other reviewers - because it totally sucks. The framerates are stunningly slow (turning 360 degrees takes 4-5 seconds), the mission load times are 20-30 seconds (what??), the bullet-time is no different from normal time (it's sepia toned - oh boy!), and the auto-save feature from the first version is missing (forcing you to stop and save your game every 1-2 minutes). In summary, this is the single worst sequel that Rockstar has ever produced, and after finishing it in under 3 days, i would barely recommend it for a rental, much less a purchase."
2,way worse than the first!!!,"I bought this game for $1 brand new and much more would not have been worth it. I loved the first Max Payne. The story and game play was great and challenging and long. this one had a terrible story and they changed a lot of things to be worse than the first. the weapons are much worse, and Max isn't as ironic and funny. there is basically no plot, you just play missions. In one cut seen Max gets shot point blank in the head and gets up with only a headache!!! the only reason i gave it two stars is because it was still kinda fun to kill bad guys and i got it so cheap. this game definitly does not live up to the first and very much disapointed me. If you havent played the first one i definitly recommend it but don't waste your time with the sequal"
1,Not worth the money,This game is not worth paying for. If you played the first game then you have played this one. It is true that there is a new story and there are some new gun configurations but the gameplay and graphics were not improved at all. The whole bullet time thing is not enough of a reason to purchase a game. When I went to sell it back they wouldnt take it so i basically had to pay them to take this joke of a game. Waste of time and DVD discs.
4,An under-rated shooter!,"I was surprised by all the negative reviews of this game. I found it very good. About the only games I enjoy are shooting games, and if you like shooters, I recommend this title highly for one simple reason. Within the game, when you shoot the bad guys, they respond as though they have really been shot. Their movements are ever-changing and very lifelike. I thought the story was very interesting and involving. I also love Hit Man 2, to give you an idea of what I like, but I like this game better. True, Hit Man 2 has better backgrounds and more weapons, but Max feels more like actual shooting."
2,Severely disappointing port to the PS2,"The PC version of Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne managed to improve on the first game in some areas and was vastly enjoyable overall, however this Playstation 2 port of the game is severely disappointing. A noticibly terrible frame rate, blurry textures, missing sound effects, an even worse save system, and ridiculously long loading times plague what could have been a stellar game. The storyline, plot twists, and even the once mediocre graphic novel-esque cut scenes are the game's few saving graces, along with the run 'n gun bullet time action that was so enjoyable in the first game, but in the end Max Payne 2's flaws outweigh it's strengths. It's a shame more time wasn't taken to make Max Payne 2 something as memorable as the first game; I really wanted to like this game despite it's flaws, but they're just too much. All in all, Max Payne 2 is still worth a rental for fans who dug the original, but don't expect anything at all great from it."
3,Don't Buy It - Rent It Instead,"Short game. Finished it in 2 days. Takes forever to load and save the games. What were the developers thinking? Last chapter was difficult (took me about ten or so tries) - may be too difficult for some without cheat codes (did not find any online). Overall, it's a fun game, but don't waste your money on it. Rent it at Blockbuster instead."
2,Mediocre at best,"I expected more from Rockstar, the company that brought us the incredible world of GTA. Max Payne 2 is defintely not GTA. The gameplay is awkward, the story is horribly written (the dialogue is so bad it makes you cringe), and the main difficulty in the game seems to lie with not getting so irritated with the game that you stop playing it. One of the few redeeming features is the bullet time mode, which is pretty cool. The humourous elements in the narrative can be entertaining as well, but it is ususally overshadowed by melodrama. Maybe if you could buy this game for $5 it would be worth it."
2,Not as good as the first,"If there was never a max payne and this came out. Everyone would have liked it better, but there is one so I hate it. The slow diving and slow bullet dodging are still there but have changed for the worse. Graphics are chucky and the textures are ugly. Sound is OK. Running around seems hard and I think the plot is just about the worst for any game ever made. Very short. still a fun game, but not for the $50."
1,PS2 version sucks.,"This is a near perfect game. For the PC that is. The PS2 port is nothing short of a disaster. Graphics are scaled down, extremely slow frame rate, and load times that will make you want to rip out your hair. Worst of all, you won't be able to make use of mods for the PS2, like you can with the PC. Do yourself a favor and buy this for PC. You won't be sorry."
3,eh.,"I broke it as I pulled it out of the box. Afer stitching it back up the kids loved it when dad dropped it from the stairs...but he doesn't jump. I thought it would bounce, but he's made of hard plastic. Certainly not extreme."
4,Precise Pronunciation Practice,"I got this book when I was sharpening my speech to prepare for a career in radio.It helped immensely, and continues to do so. Even the introduction is well written and very precise. I don't think an average child would be much interested in it, however, though with it's animated illustrations, it would appear that they would be. However, if you want to improve your speech, or that of a child, this book is an excellent tool to use."
2,Not what I expected.,"This DVD has thirteen very basic exercises. Only a couple of the execises are scale based. There is one 5-note pattern in G major, and a couple of very basic sequences in box 1 of the minor pentatonic scale.If you just want to exercise your hands picking chromatic runs that have little or no practical application, that's what you get.I was hoping for exercises that would teach scales and modes while at the same time exercising and developing muscle memory and speed.As gifted a teacher as Danny Gill usually is, I was dissappointed with this product."
2,Purposely and completely unbelievable,"I have never read a book that was worse than the movie, this is the one. It is written in first person with appallingly bad spelling to represent Forrest's poor grammer and accent. It amazes me that any producer reading this book thought that it would be a good movie, thank goodness that the producer ommitted most of the book from the movie. The happenings are, I think, purposefully unbelievable and border on asinine. I do not recommend reading Forrest Gump, rent the movie, you will enjoy it much more!"
5,Transforming concepts,"I have read this book twice since I purchased it, underlining it the second time. I have read books about Christ living His life through us over the years (such as Grace Walk, Lifetime Guarantee, The Normal Christian Life) but Dan Stone's book articulated the concepts in such a down-to-earth way that I found it easier to begin to apply these concepts to my life and my walk with the Lord. I have purchased copies of this book to give to family members and friends and have recommended it strongly to others."
4,biblical perspective,"i think that outside of the Word itself, there are few books that will actually empower and encourage you to live in the freedom that Christ has given, this book being one of them. it's not a devotional, not a doctrine, it merely brings out some truth of the Word and that the gospel is just that - nearly too good to be true news! i encourage people to read this book to find out more of the life that is in you and your new identity in Christ. blessings."
5,the exchanged life,This book was highly recommended and I can now highly recommend it to others. The book arrived earlier than I exspected.
4,Good old Norman,"Beautiful prints that speak for themselves. They depict not only the simplicity and innocence of every day life events of a time that was, but they evoke so many different emotions that we almost forgot we have inside us."
3,"GED Lenguaje, Lectura (Steck-Vaughn)","This book is good for preparing for the GED in Spanish because, like the other Steck-Vaughn GED books, it has short and concise lessons, relevant exercises, and detailed answers in the back. The practice tests are also very useful.What I and my students have trouble with is the Spanish translation and how this can cause miscommunication. This is present in all the Steck-Vaughn books. All of the readings in the Lectura book are translations from English and therefore are not representation of what one would read in Spanish. I am not sure whether this is true in the actual GED test, but take it in stride as many of the materials used in the U.S. are in a sort of ""Spanglish.""The dialect and word choice is also often not understood by my Mexican students here in California. In general, we deal with these issues as part of the larger issue of Spanish in the U.S. and appreciate the clearness of the lessons and the detailed answers."
5,Beatle Magic!,"This delightful set of Beatle figures is a must have for the serious collector. The Beatle figures and the little stage they rest on is fairly durable. From an educational standpoint, they will undoubtedly spark an interest in the Beatles from younger fans and people just becoming aware of the Beatles.Since this is really more of a collector set, I would not recommend getting this for children under ten. If you are lucky and have all 4 Beatle figures, you can put the stage together and enjoy a Beatle display, yeah, yeah, yeah!"
5,2.5 Kicks To The Head,"This collection is a great buy. Not only is the packaging superb, but there are extensive liner notes and the official bullet-points of The White Panther party so you can understand the rights, people, and beliefs this band stood up for.Included in this box set are two complete concerts and one EP (half concert?)that will kick your head straight into the next election year.Side note: There have been complaints about these concerts being of poor sound quality...nothing a decent equalizer can't solve. In fact, let that be a musical life lesson to you."
2,poor sound quality make this box problematic,"the sound quality of this box set is lousy. it varies somewhat from cd to cd (separate performances) but it's never good. vocals are muffled and distorted throughout and even some spoken song intros are hard to understand. at times the bass is nonexistent. in short, real bootleg recordings from 1968 & 70. so although the band seems to be in very good form here, only ardent MC5 fans need consider buying this because the sound quality's a real problem. 2 and 1/2 stars."
4,It never gets fresher than this,"Certainly there are groups that put a premium on swing, others runs through changes, others like melodies and freedom. Ahmad Jamal certainly swings and swings hard too, but he loves space, vamps, ostinato, abrupt tempo changes, dynamics, flourishes, reconstructing tunes. Ephraim (bass) is the anchor to hold you down and Arti colours the space as Ahmad takes off and swirls, playing quiet as a mouse and suddenly exploding.The most frustrating thing to me about this CD is that you don't know what volume to set your music system at, they play beautiful melodies and you are tempted to crank it up to hear Jamal and the next thing squirrels and birds are scattering as you run for the remote to turn it down. (Hint: The bass should be your volume guide too).All in all a recording that you mine for melodic nuggets for a very long time."
5,Great read,"For anyone who lives in a suburb of a major city, you'll love reading about Grosvenor, NJ. You'll recognize someone in all the characters, making the mystery all that much more fun. I hope there's more in the offing about the odd goings-on in this typical American town."
5,A duo that **SHINES**,"This Duo makes great music, creates charm and class through their music! Between the flute and guitar, Ben Verdery and Rie Schmidt the music will always be good!"
1,DISAPPOINTING,"Comes with a quick charger, but there is a warning sticker on the battery that says ""Do not quick charge"". That should give you some clue of this products quality. There is no information in the package about how long the battery should be charged with the included charger, but using the recommended 4 hours of other batteries, it's been a real disappointment. The battery will last about 30 seconds in the starter for my nitro truck. Don't buy this one."
2,BORING!,"I hope the 25 year anniversary book is better, the cover of it looks promising enough with Jay Adams and the classic Skate & Destroy motto I live by across the front, but this one is b o r i n g."
5,One of Louie's Best!,This is a really great Louie Bellson CD. All songs are great and the recording quality is really good. Louie does a phenomenal extended drum solo on Santos.
5,Don't Even Think of Raining On My Parade,"This book is witty, funny and uplifting. It's bursting with humorous stories and anecdotes, is easy to read, and had me laughing out loud throughout. It really makes you think twice about how negative our society has become, while at the same time recognizing and celebrating all the beautiful, precious, happy moments in life. I only wish there were more books like this, and would highly recommend you get a copy for yourself, as well as a few extra copies for friends and family (as I did after I finished reading it)."
4,Meets my needs,The product is very satisfactory. I use it for handling bread dough and picking up chopped veggies from the cutting board. It is nice kitchen accessory.
4,pretty good,This is a simple tool that does what it is supposed to at a reasonable price. What more could you want?
4,Does the job!,"I needed a simple dough scraper to take my cookie dough out the bowl, or clean the table after I was finished rolling my dough out and this scraper does just that. If you want something simple for cheap, then get this scraper."
3,Ought have a smaller model avaiable too. Not as flexible.,"As it is hard to bend, it doesn't work as well with, say, a food processor bowl. Perhaps one of theiSi North America B10001 Silicone Scraper Spatula, Redwould be more suitable."
3,Durable and Great color,"I will begin with the positive first. So it is durable, good quality and easy to clean. Negatives, the only reason I gave it 3 stars is because it is really big and not flexible or bendable at all. I cannot use it for all my pans and pots, and it is very difficult to get to the corners and clean it, because it does not bend at all. But overall it is good quality and it seems that it will stay like that."
5,Works The Best,My son worked for many years in a bakery and he swears by this. He says it's the only kind he likes to use.
3,ChefBbyBear,this is a fairly good product...it was easy to clean although it could have been a little more flexible to make removing the dough easier but all in all it was still a good product
4,Fast Track,"Very easy reading, informative. Good overview of the industries. Some information is outdated, especially with the many merges in the industry, but still applicable."
2,Not so good,"I bought this book last week after seeing it on a bookshelf at my campus career center. I have to say, I haven't found it to be as useful as some of the other commenters seem to think."
2,Not too useful...,"""FAST TRACK"" offers little advice and encouragement for students from untargeted schools and professionals hoping to switch fields. (The people that need the most career help! ) Why write a book for Ivy Leaguers and business undergrads/grads who already have a running start?"
3,good overview but light in Investment Banking,"This book is a good overview of the investment banking business, .... I would strongly recommend instead or in addition the Vault Career Guide to Investment Banking, .... The Vault guide includes more detailed overviews of all the departments and functions of an investment bank including corporate finance, M&A, sales, trading, private client services, credit, etc. If you are a job seeker in investment banking also try the Vault Guide to Finance Interviews, which contains actual investment banking finance interview questions and answers and which I found to be enormously valuable in my Wall Street job search."
3,"Lots of good information, but...","It seemed to me that the author took these three fundamentally different careers that she happened to know a lot about, and wrote a book about them. The result is a book that is poorly organized and makes you search for the information you want. Despite the lack of organization, the content isn't bad; I feel like I'll be a lot better prepared for interviews and stuff if I do decide to interview at an investment bank after I graduate."
4,Good supplement to other guides I read,"I thought this guide was a very good supplement to the VaultReports guides I read on Management Consulting and Investment Banking, plus other guides. Still recommend doing even more research beyond just this book, like visiting companies' Web sites and reading other books."
5,Everything you need to know is in this book!,This book covers everything you need to know (undergrad or MBA) to land a job in management consulting or i-banking (it's less helpful for securities trading). No career counselor or other book comes close to delivering the wealth of information in The Fast Track. I highly recommend it!
3,Don't get your hopes up too high,"This book does a pretty good job of explaining how these businesses work and how they recruit. However, it isn't going to be very helpful if you're looking for a job. These places look for people with the right background, the right skills, and only then does it matter how many books you've read or how many case questions you've practiced. By all means, read this book, but it's more important to work on your connections and make sure your resume's content (not its form) is strong."
2,"Some good information, but the target is off","I am a top student from a solid, tiny ""untargeted"" liberal arts school. It seems to me that the advice in this book is for elite students who already have an enormous advantage. They are not the ones who need the insight; those who seek consulting jobs and are not from ivy league schools deserve better advice. If the school on your degree is not ""brand name"", you're better off seeking advice from more optimistic and realistic books. Ms. Naficy's book is depressing and her perceptions are skewed. I put down the book with the most unsatisfied feeling, and called my academic advisor (who is a consultant herself) for the best advice."
2,A bit of a turn-off,"This book does have some good information about the nature of the jobs discussed, but it left me cold. The trouble I had with it was that the author seemed to be suggesting that the jobs were somehow desirable, when in fact, after reading the text and interviews, it seems a repellent line of work to get into. The long hours and the competitive and grueling nature of the interview process seem like turn-offs, and the work itself seems unfulfilling. The book would be useful to those who are convinced that they would want to work in consulting or banking, though after reading this book they may actually be dissuaded (as I was) from entering such a vile, corporate environment. I suppose the author is to be commended for writing this book, but I couldn't help thinking that it was a rather unchallenging book for her to write (given her background)."
4,Mind the Gap,"Naficy's work is helpful for building a general understanding of these industries, the attributes sought in potential hires, and how to demonstrate these attributes.Those serious about fast track careers should supplement their reading. This book was published in 1997 and is sorely in need of an update. To address your coverletters to Andersen Consulting would be a serious blooper (they are now Accenture). Although expensive, WetFeet and Vault publish some phenomenal in-depth reports that are more candid and current."
2,Black & Blue,"As for the content, it was ok. I was, (am) upset that I ordered a new CD, paid for a new CD, and received a used one. It skips several times. I do not order used CD's for that reason. Its not worth the bother to send it back. Live and learn I guess."
4,Not too shabby for the price,"I was pleasantly surprised to find out that this case is more rigid than I was expecting. Both the front and the back are stiffened to protect your PSP. I wasn't too crazy about the magnetic ""button"" that closes it, but it hasn't been a problem yet. One concern is that the PSP fits very tightly into the case, enough that I unknowingly switched my unit on a couple times (not a happy surprise). I'd assume this will stop happening as the leather wears in, so I'm not overly upset about this. The only other thing I'd call attention to is the fact that there is NO additional storage, I knew this and was okay with it, but thought I should mention it here as a reminder to those shopping for a case. All in all I gave it four stars because it is ""elegant"" and does what it's supposed to; protects your PSP and takes up as little space as possible doing it. I'd recommend it!"
2,What you should know before your order,"Firstly, the case works fine. It does its job. That's the most important thing.Now, for those of us who are picky:1. The images don't show the imprinted lettering on the top right corner of the case (with the magnet closure on the right). It's a sans-serif font that says ""P.SP"" and it might not bother everyone. I did read about this in another review, but the lettering is much larger than I expected. Just thought I'd note it since the images don't show it.2. The wrist strap that comes with it is not leather and metal. It's fabric and (I'm guessing) plastic that is painted silver.3. The case is very tight with the PSP and two UMDs in it. The flap with the UMDs inside will leave an imprint on the leather covering the PSP. The magnet closure will still close -- so the case still works perfectly.Nothing major. Just not what I expected."
2,Educational tool for your choldren-I don't think so.,"The only benefit of this CD as an educational tool for young violinist is a tempo. Musically devastated, lacking an imagination all this interpretation are extemlly boring so I am lucky that I bought used one for half a prize. Itzhak Perlman keep shacking his long notes vibrato with no reason particularly in Rieding concertino plus that horrible unexpressive string ocestra- Poor!Mirro"
5,A unique album,"This unique album, in which Itzhak Perlman shows his wonderful talent better than ever, is a good demonstration to use for young musical starters. The album starts out easy and gets more and more difficult in the techniques and styles of playing the violin. I have been playing the violin myself for quite some time now and have just completed the Schueler-Conzert no.2 by using it as an audition piece for a scholarship. I now plan to move on to the next piece which is quite a step more difficult than the first two. Of the many Itzhak Perlman albums I have, I would definitely recommend this one to teenagers and young adults. It's worth getting!"
5,A Classic,"I am a student in violin that was recently studying Accolay and this CD has made it so much easier for me to play it. It gives you the romantic feeling and elegance. This is very relaxing music for anyone. If you are a student in any string instrument, this CD would be very helpful to catch the style of this piece."
5,Zand Elderberry Zinc Lozenge,"I had purchased these before at a local store, but after they were out of them time after time I decided to order on line, I was very happy that I was able to do that, I am a Diabetic and am limited on what kind of lozenges I can use, and find the ""Zand Elderberry Zinc Lozenge"" to work best for me and I will order again.The order was filled promptly and arrived in excellent condition, Thank you"
5,Better than Dr. Spock's!,"All four of my kids were patients of Dr. Schiller and I couldn't have asked for a better pediatrician. This book was my ""bible."" My kids liked him so much that he finally had to tell them (at 18!) they had to go to another doctor...they were too old for a pediatrician!This book is a must for parents...it really is a common sense approach to caring for young children."
2,"This is a ridiculous, trivial book.","In this book, one can learn that: The internet started as a Defense Department project in the 80's p. 120 The proper way to search for pager manufacturing in internet web search engines is just to mention ""pager"", and not worry at all about other key words or symbols. p. 124 That, according to an intelligence project, pager repair could be a great business. p.139 I was lead to believe by a book review that this book would give me a great deal of information about passive intelligence gathering. It does not live up to its promise, and lacks credibility for so many factual (1,1969 2, +pager +manufacture + industry +trends ) and analytical (3 I threw my cell phone away, and got another for free)errors. What a shame."
5,global language use,"I read this book to research the topic of English as a global lingua franca as part of a graduate course in sociolinguistics. It is about the single most useful text I read in this field. I highly recommend it to anyone who is interested in how English is used in different contexts across the globe. The text gives critical insight throughout, e.g. looks at the spread of English past and present in contexts such as Nigeria, India, Japan etc."
4,Fast Shipping,Received this quickly and in excellent condition. Another great Amazon purchase! I also purchased with A Sacred Sorrow - this is the experience guide. I was a little confused and thought I might be getting two of the same released under different titles but there is a difference! Order both if you want to get the full effect.
2,Not the Best Richie Compilation,"If your CD collection is weak on Lionel Richie and you are looking for a nice compilation of his hits, I would recommend ""The Definitive Collection"" over this ""20th Century Masters"" album. This CD only has 11 tracks. ""The Definitive Collection"" has 20, and it's still 1 CD. This album is inexcusably missing some of Lionel's most significant and important hits, including ""Endless Love,"" ""Stuck On You,"" ""Sail On,"" ""Penny Lover,"" and ""Ballerina Girl."" All of those songs are on ""The Definitive Collection."" There are some tracks from this CD that aren't on ""The Definitive Collection,"" so I recommend you compare the track lists before choosing. But in the end, I think you will agree that this is (by far) the weaker of the two sets."
5,Was a gift,Cannot rate this either as I have not heard it. It was a gift and my sister loves it so I gave it the highest rating for her as she said it is great.
5,Best of Lionel Richie,"If you like Lionel Richie, you'll enjoy this packed full of hits CD. Great value for the money, old school tunes, great listening pleasure."
5,Wonderful,Another great example of combining the wonderful sounds of the tuba and with modern jazz. The sounds that came out of that tuba were simply amazing. A very enjoyable cd.
2,"A little disappointed, not enough info, too short","Recently I got interested in the ancient world of Egypt and decided to learn how to read hieroglyphs. I was interested in learning a little more about the life of the young man that unlocked the key to Egyptology when he figured out how to read Egyptian hieroglyphs. I knew that this was a children's book and hoped it would be a pleasant read about Champollion's life. Well, the story is very short and without much depth. I was disappointed. I wasn't expecting much from this book, but it didn't even deliver that. I don't think it will be a very inspiring book to children."
5,"take it as a bloody summer holiday, mate",It is very hot summer in this story...and it is boring too if we don't do anything during summer season. Well this book give me a sport reading with some actions. Very entertaining..just another different summer. Having a good bloody summer with predators!
4,Welcome to the jungle...,"Shaefer was a New York cop, a tough S.O.B. who went by his own rules. New York was his city and when he runs into trouble he refuses to back down.But what happens when the trouble is a six foot tall alien who wants your head on a stick?This novel is based on a very cool Dark Horse Comic book, Predator Volume One, and frankly the book is better in some ways. You get more details, more insight onto the characters and their thoughts. And it's a fast read too."
4,I love predator and i love this book,This is a must read book for all predator lovers!! If you have never read a book or seen the movies it is not to late to start
1,Uhhhhhh...,"...It was poorly written, borrowed WAY too much from the movies, and just seemed like a cheesy Saturday afternoon movie. The stuff that happened in that book was impossible, or next to impossible, and this is funny because the book is supposed to be science fiction. Perish forbid, I love the movies, but this book doesn't deserve the title. First of all, they use Arnold's brother, and he even is suppose to be just like Arnold. Then they chalk him up full of one liners ""Good, maybe then I can get a nice apartment."" and all this other stuff. Arnold can only deliever the perfect one liners. Another thing I find dumb is when he just flys down to South America to visit a drug lord and spends his money to get there (not the drug lord).I fail to see why this has 4 stars, I'd expected 2 and a half stars for the total review. It just wasn't that good of a book and I feel I have somehow lost intelligence from reading it..."
3,Read This.,"I would give this book about 3 and 1/2 stars if i could. the story was ok, but there was way to much cursing, not just in the diolog, but also in the words of the 3rd person. this reduses the amount of stars that i would give it. also the ending was alittle... uninterresting. but the overall storyline was wounderful. do read this book. it is my first Predator book, the next will be COLD WAR."
4,West African get down,"Solomon Ilori recorded this record in 1964-65 an odd selection for Bluenote at the time,who were still pushing hard bop jazz. The disc has traditional high life styled songs with Ilori performing alongside his ensemble on various drums and handling the vocal duties. The music is typical Nigerian high life music from that era reminiscent of percussionist/vocalist the late Babba Olutunji,however the final three tracks heat up with the addition of Hubert Laws on flute and performing on tenor sax(yes Hubert ..not Ronnie on Tenor sax and,and brother he burns!!) also Donald Byrd is feature on trumpet and fluglehorn while Elvin Jones jams alongside on drums for a free jazz/african high life party...impressive gem from the BlueNote vaults."
2,Not shock resistant as advertised,"The drive's box says it has ""DROP SHOCK Technology"", but when my 1-year-old swept the (not-turned-on) Iomega drive off our coffee table and it fell two feet to the wood floor, it was permanently damaged and all my data were lost.The drive may be convenient and large, but do not treat it as a robust storage mechanism!"
3,Iomega Portable Hard Drive 160GB,"Good Iomega quality for a great price. I have had several Iomega drives without problems. A couple of downsides : 1. It takes 2 USB connections. 2. Sometimes not recognised by my laptop. Iomega says necessary drive is already in Vista so I used windows to update the driver. Seems to work but if not, I may need to purchase a power source."
1,backup software sucks,"bought this to use with a mac. doesn't work out of box with a mac, despite the description. had to crawl the help site to discover that it needs to be reformatted before using with a mac.after about an hour I gave up trying to figure out the ""retrospect"" backup software that was included with the drive. I'm very computer literate and just kept getting a stream of errors when trying to get it to back up my mac, so put it back in its box and shipped it back to amazon. I'm going for the maxor one-touch, which I've heard great things about."
5,The Brits do it again,"For some reason the British have the best graphics magazines...always the best reviews and tutorials. Thus it is no surprise that the book, Revolutionary - Final Cut Pro 2 by Blissett et al, is such a fine book. About the first third of the book deals with planning a production, actually shooting the footage, and preparing the footage for editing. All of these discussions are accompanied by examples and real world comments.The rest of the book deals with Final Cut Pro 2 (FCP2) in a logical progression from clip capture to editing, then on to special effects and concluding with sound. Throughout the discussions are examples to work along with as well as a continuing project called ""yootclub.""This book gives an excellent introduction to video production, in general, and FCP2 in particular."
2,Disappointed,"These are indeed three great artists and I bought this album based on other excellent customer reviews & comments, but I was disappointed. One person's music can be another person's noise and this album is not the easy-listening jazz album that I had expected. I am sure it is just right for some, but it fell far short my expectations."
5,Drummers Need Not Apply,"This trio can really swing! Propelled by one of the greatest bass players the jazz world has known, and a guitarist of guitarists, the late Messrs. Ray Brown and Joe Pass, André Previn is a classical pianist that really swings in this ""after hours"" setting. The drumless trio exhibits a full, rich tapestry of harmonic empathy that keeps you hooked up until the last note is played. This is Jazz with a capital J, and Mr. Previn's phrasings reinforce his mastery of the piano in a varied jazz repertoire. My five stars go to this trio that unfortunately cannot be replicated. Highly recommended."
5,Andre Previn - After Hours,"I'm not much of a jazz aficionado, but Previn has turned out some great recordings and this certainly ranks in the upper echelon. I'm not going to try to analyze it to death - I always like hearing this CD and everybody for whom I've played it has agreed. 6 stars. The sixth is to negate the one four star rating."
5,"Amazing, varied, challenging, and fun leisure reading","Collaboratively edited by David Wolfe and Tom Rodgers, Puzzlers' Tribute: A Feast For The Mind is an amazing compilation of classic brain teasers collected from all walks of science, mathematics, and verbal riddles to test the reader's thinking skills to their highest degree. Each puzzle is not only proffered, but comes with a detailed explanation as to the true nature of the problem, as well as a step-by-step solution. Highly recommended for mathematicians, magicians, and puzzle enthusiasts, Puzzlers' Tribute is amazing, varied, challenging, and fun leisure reading guaranteed to give its readers an itch for pencil and paper to work the problems out for themselves!"
3,Okay but not great,"First thing I would like to say to anyone that purchases this item that once they add water, make sure to remove as much air as posible and don't unintentionally add more air in when capping it up. Trapped air will make it very difficult for your pet to use without stumbling.The product itself seems very durable.My dog does not really seek it out when she is hot but some mornings I do find her laying on it waiting for me to feed her. I think it will depend on dog preference more than anything if your dog will use it."
5,Solid Swinging Trio,"Ray Brown is such a tasty player. He gives a lot of latitude to the others in the trio and they do a wonderful job. Jeff Hamilton is one of the best jazz drummers I have ever heard. Benny Green is exciting to listen to. The final cut ""Phineas Can Be"" is a fitting homage to the great Phineas Newborn. This is a fine disk."
2,For the 60's Look,"There are a nice range of projects in this book - everything from beaded fringe throw pillows to beaded curtains. For the beginner or someone looking to add some beaded accents to their home this would be a nice book to check out. For the serious beader - skip this one, there are far better books out there that will challenge your skills."
1,A complete waste of hard-earned money!,"DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY! very poor quality, i would have been better off going to the 99 cent store. the teeth are flimsy rubber and have no way to 'mold' into your mouth. they will not stay in and you have a real chance of swallowing them, but you will likely take them out because they are very uncomfortable to wear. a complete waste of money and the worst product i have ever received from Amazon... the plastic glasses are again of extremely poor quality..."
2,Cheap teeth!,The teeth won't stay in place. The glasses are exactly what I expected. S&H makes this item quite expensive. What a great business to be in -- Costumes & Accessories. Buy your stuff from China for pennies on the dollar and charge 500% or more to the customer.
1,the worst TV Themes album I've ever heard,"don't waste your money. Most of these are performed by some lounge orchestra and they ""jazz-up"" the themes. Most of these are not the original themes as you heard them on tv, that's obvious, but they really butcher some of my favorites (M*A*S*H and Star Trek). It's not worth the money."
4,No problems at all,I've used this fly rive on several different computers and have not had a single problem. It is easy to use and very intuitive.
5,Tribute to Muddy,"I recently got this through Amazon Marketplace for around $5,so I can't complain about the price!Differing from most ""tribute"" albums,this tribute is by musicians that had actually played with Muddy Waters at some point,and I think that definitely makes this different,and better.The whole cd is excellent,but my personal favorites on here are Trouble No More,sung by Gregg Allman,and also Clouds In My Heart,as done by Buddy Guy.The Allman track is similar to the version of Trouble No More that Gregg did with the Allman Brothers.All the musicians involved are superior.I highly recommend this for fans of Muddy Waters,and for fans of blues music in general."
4,Better than Red Vines!,"Panda Licorice is very unique, and has an herbal taste to it (I bought the original flavor). The flavor lasts long after you've swallowed a piece, which is a huge plus. I also love that it's healthy and all-natural! Great alternative to ordinary candy."
4,Works as expected,"I bought these so my kids would be able to move the couch in our family room. The couch needs to be moved to clear space for them to play Kinect games and the old rubber pads meant that Dad had to move the couch for them. These pads still protect the hardwoods but the felt bottom allows the couch to slide with less resistance. I'm not sure about the durability since the core is a much softer rubber than the previously used pads. If they last 6 months, I'd still be happy since the replacement cost is minimal."
5,multi-cultural,ordered this book for my class at HU. had to use this book since the professor was the author. great book still have it after 4/5 years
5,one of the best clamps to use,"This clamp and mounting head are excellent to use in photography. It allows your to place the camera in places that would be hard to do with a tripod. Outstanding item, can't ask for any better."
1,hard to understand,had been looking for this book for awhile. when recieved and read was highly disappointed. book was really hard to keep up with and understand the dialogue or to keep up with. to read this book you have to be really bored or nothing else in the house to read. i will continue to search the one written by patrick henden. sorry to say this version was really bad and i was disappointed.
4,"Good game, but shadow of former self!","Max Payne 2 had all the great aspects the first Max payne had, but fell through when it was time to deliver. If you played the first Max Payne then chances are you will buy this game hands down, possibly for story reasons. However Max Payne 2 does not live up to its former self. With only about 12 hours of gameplay it is possible to sit down and finish the game in one sitting. Before long you will be engrosed with the so-so plot and end up just wanting to beat the next level to see how everything plays out, but when the game comes to a sudden stop, you will find yourself asking ""Thats It?"" Max 2 still has the great action elements that made the first one such a hit, and with unlockable difficulties you may find yourself playing through this game more then once. Nothing new is added (sadly), so if you liked the first Max you will probably love this one, but there is not enough change to sway new players into buying this game!"
3,It was way to short,"OK&lt; I played both Max Payne 1 and 2, and my opinion is that 1 is alot better then 2 due to the fact that it was harder and longer.... I did like 2 don't get me wrong but that game is way to short.... I like it what I was Mona for a few times, that was good, and different.... That graphics were good, I'd say better then the first.... I did like the story line, even though it was a love story what I call a chick flick.... But it all comes down to this, it only took me 2 days to clear it, and it was way to easy, I think my friend who never cleared a game yet, would clear this. All and all I give it a 3 star rating, just for the fact that it is a short game play and way to easy."
2,Don't blink........,"Plain and simple this game is just too short. I figured I could get my $55 of satisfaction by playing this game 2-3 hours a day for the next couple of weeks, at least. Well, 3 days, and approximately 9 hours of game play later, the game was over. These additional chapters to the original story line should have just been made available on XBOX live for download. Do yourself a favor and just rent it over a weekend. You'll beat the game and save yourself money."
3,Good game,"Max payne 2 is a good game but not a great game let me tell you why. There are only three drawbacks in this game that bother me, first off the bullet time is differant and not in a good way. When you go in to bullit time the color of the screen goes to a drab kind of yellow and the slow motion is not very slow unlike the first game where it was very slow and it felt much more matrix like, second the game is much easyer than the first and is also shorter, and third there is a bullet hole glitch in the game that will let you blast holes in some rooms and not in others? All in all it is a good game but I recomend the first game It's much better."
2,Why doesn't Rockstar update with the times?,"The graphic quality has improved since the first one but that is not saying much. My least favorite part of the whole graphic quality of the game is, anytime you see a car, the windshield is not glass, instead it is a hard blue concrete. Also Payne's cutscenes in Graphic Novels is neat, but he talks in riddles the whole damn time! This is annoying. Gun battles are still fun, collision detection is still horrible. This could most likely be called Max Payne 1.5"
2,Not as great as it sounds.,"Max Payne is not a great game. It's all shooting, no fighting or dirving at all. Its story is so werid and freaked out that I can't understand it at all. I expected better from Rockstar."
5,Great,"Be Aware that this CD does not Play on my Toshiba A205-S5843 Laptop which is No Fault to the Distributor, they offered to takes it back with shipment on them but it Still Plays on my Sony, Pioneer and LG and it Sounds Awesome, for you Jazz lovers you will Appreciate the Dynamics of the Sound when Played on just a Decent Pair of Speakers provided you have a Sub to take Advantage of the Deep Lows, Highly Recommended! :)"
4,Why no .mp3 download of this ?,"Hey Amazon,It looks like all the other American Recordings are available as an .mp3 download. Why not this one? Is someone asleep at the switch? Help !"
4,Wow....,"I never was a Johnny Cash fan until I heard ""God's gonna cut you down"". I was really taken back by this song, as well as the rest of his American Recordings."
2,American V: A Hundred Highways,"A very sad album. Johnny`s voice sounds weak and like it`s cracking and wavering. Almost every song is about dying. Listening to it depressed me. It is a very raw album, with a lot of emotion in it."
2,Disappointment,"I don't know what I expected, being that Johnny Cash was in such bad shape when these songs were made. The songs are really slow and he sounds very tired. I listened to it one time and probably will never listen to it again. Get a greatest hits cd. All singers are the best when they are young."
1,How to Market a Dead Man on a CD,"This is a good example on how to market a dead man on his miss fortune and cash out on his miss ""fortune like Rick Rubin did on this one. If you want to cry buy this discs because it will make you cry because it is highly depressing. I hope that Mr Rubin that God punish you for this one I do not want to play it again and if you could read my mind Rick for this job on a dead great artist like Johnny Cash. I hope you walk the line to his grave"
5,AMAZING!,The legend of Johnny Cash lives on!!Johnny Cash uses his soul-ful voice and a greatguitar to make this one of the best releasesin country music so far in 2006.
5,Recorded after June's death and finished after Johnny's death,"Johnny Cash / A Hundred Highways / American V (American Recordings): This album is painfully good. The man had lost his wife (June Carter Cash) and in this CD he sings of loss, faith, and love. The loss of June and his own impending death shows in his nearly tortured voice and yet, he gives us this gift of pure brilliance. Johnny finished his vocals but died before the album was completed. The huge hit here is his ""God's Gonna Cut You Down"" which is a warning to repentance that in 2011 was (inexplicably) being used as the background of a television car commercial (some folks never learn). This is another Masterpiece. This one deserves a Sixth Star."
5,CASH American V: A Hundred Highways,We had planned on purchasing this CD for awhile; checked on Amazon and there is was! We really enjoy it and are extremely happy that we finally have it. It is the heart of Johnny Cash felt in every song.
4,Not the voice of old but still enjoyable.,I like Johnny Cash and thought this CD was special considering it was his last. His voice had alot of emotion in it which I am sure is because of the death of his wife. It is definately worth having in your Johnny Cash collection.
3,Mournful,"Johnny's last CD is that of a very sick man staring death in the face, mourning the loss of his wife, and trying to celebrate parts of his life. On first hearing it, I was disappointed; however, subesquent listening has helped me see the value of his work and the honesty with which he is facing death. This CD is not for everyone yet everyone should hear it at least once."
5,Alan D. R.,This is a side to Cash I was not familiar with but it is really a wonderful end to his singing life. His voice may waiver every now and then but it only adds to the powerful sound of that incredible tone we have come to love in his music. It took a while for the difference to sink in but I now consider this CD one of my favorites.
4,Cash is king,"I bought this for ""God's gonna cut you down"" which is a great song and I like most of the others as well."
5,Songs of my heart . . . .,"I'm not going to pretend to be musically astute and theoretically compare how this album may have sounded if the Great JRC himself had been around to approve/disapprove the use of cellos in ""Help Me.""I'm going to tell you that when I thought ""The Man Comes Around"" would always be my favorite Cash album, it's only because this one hadn't been made yet. Each and every cut touches my heart . . . comforts me, delights me, gives me courage. (Yeah, even ""Like the 309"")So, I'm gonna make this short and sweet. Thank God, thank God and Rick Rubin for One More Cash."
4,American V: A Hundred Highways,I am glad I bought this CD even though it makes me sad to listen to it.The voice is old and I know it is the last of so many.
5,Outstanding CD....,"...featuring the deep faith of Johnny Cash in several outstanding cover tunes and religious songs.Not recommended for a Cash-beginner, but long time fans will appreciate the album."
3,Good but not great,I was not particularly impressed with this CD. It was JC singing a lot of other peoples material and I thought it was a bit dark. Not too bad. My favorite track was number 2.
5,A Truly Beautiful Album,"Its one of the most honest efforts in songwriting I've heard. I'm listening to it and crying. Its just truth and honesty. No posturing, no trying to appear cool, just pain, regret and hope from repentence. My collection has about 3000 CDs in it, but this is going into the 20-30 which are in regular rotation. The postumous arrangements are perfect as well as the musicians chosen to fill out the recordings. Its a beautiful crown to end a magnificent career... but painful to listen to because it reminds of the tremendous loss it was when he died. An illustration of his growth as an artist up until the day he died."
3,Vintage!,"All music is a form of art. For all of you who appreciate the art of music in all its various forms, you will find this album refreshing for the heart, body and soul. Do enjoy."
2,false advertising,"The box clearly states 250 cfm. This fan isn't by a long shot. It might be 50 cfm. All I know is I have computer fans that move more air than this thing does. It would be nice if the manufacturer would say capable of moving up to 250 cfm because otherwise the box lettering would have you believe this little fan can move 250 cfm on its own. It is fairly quiet, but it should be more silent for the amount of air it moves. Again computer fans that move more air and are silent compared to this thing. I think I might try replacing this with a 120 mm computer case fan and see how it works in the duct vs this thing.I surely won't lose any airflow either way. Either that or I will end up putting in a heavier inline fan and building supports to hold the weight.After all the reason I bought this was price and the weight. I didn't want to do the extra work of building support brackets for a heavier fan.At least I will have the CFM I will need though.."
3,works ok for what it was designed,"works fine but 250 CFM's isnt enough power to move any serious air, would buy the more powerful one next time."
3,not that strong,I bought 2 fans from 2 vendors. this one is quieter but has less airflow and fluctuates as doors are opened or closed. It has a lot less power and is built cheaper. I would say it has about as much power as a 70 cfm bathroom fan. plus I found it a little cheaper at Lowes a few weeks later.
1,6 Inch In Line Duct Fan,"I was most unhappy with this duct fan. It bearly moved air and actually caused the system air to become slower out of the vents. This is a poor design and should only be considered as a way to move air outside of a ductwork system. Stay clear of this if you are looking for real air movement and understand the distinction with regards to CFM in a ""real air"" scenario. I assure you that disastifaction is guaranteed if you think this fan will supplement your AC or heating system. I am shocked that reviews on this item have anything positive to say."
1,china junk,"This unit is true china junk. This unit is described as a six inch duct but only measures 5-3/4"". The lable does not even point in the right direction of the air flow. The unit sounds like a freight train coming down the duct. I would not recommend this unit to anyone."
2,"Fan works,but....","This fan pushes the heat but makes too much wind noise,so I will return it. It is easier to install then the large tjernlund M-6."
4,A great fun read,"A good pacey read. Lots of great dialogue between the characters builds up a believable atmosphere of intrigue, suspicion and mistrust in the workplace while at the same time the friendships and office politics parts of the relationships between the characters continue to shine through."
3,Interesting Alternate History,"Lund writes of an interesting alternate history that would take place if the U.S. Constitution had failed to be ratified by the states. It was an easy, fun read with plenty of action. His history seemed flawed in a few places but overall I enjoyed it."
4,thought provoking,This book gives an opportunity to think about our country and the freedom we have from a different perspective.
5,Exciting book!,"This book while fiction, is very good and really makes one stop and re think how blessed we are to live in America and it really brings out my feelings of patriotism!"
2,unsatisfied,I ordered this book for my daughter as it was due for a class she is in. The book had taken about 10 days to get to me (1 day before my daughter needed it) and when it did it had a paper in it stating it had water damage. There was also a $1 sticker on the back of the book. I assume the person I bought it from paid that and I paid more (plus shipping). I will never order from this person or company again.
4,Significantly better than others,"I read this book and also ""A practical introduction to data structures and algorithims"" by Schaffer. Weiss' was much clearer; the code was cleaner and less confusing."
1,Disastrous,"I tried my very best to follow the examples in the book, and when it came to recursion, I found that many parts of the code were not explained at all. This book confuses. Do not buy if you're a computer science beginner. It is simply not beginner-friendly."
5,It great,material cover in the book provided me an insight of how to use the power of Java.I used the examples in the book to solove several current problem. David L. Wasler
3,"Good, for serious programmer",The Data Structures in the book is most likely adapted from old data structures in c++. It should be titled as Data Structures and Problem Solving Using C++.
1,Mostly code from JDK source for collections,"I bought this book with great expectations after reading the positive reviews. But the book only provides the interfaces for most of the collections (Data Structures?) and provides very similar implementations to that of the SUN's source with some of implementations left to the reader to complete. Instead of buying this book, you are better off downloading the Source from the SUN JDK 1.5 (JAVA 5) and reading the javadocs."
3,Didn't Use It Much,"Book was a required textbook for a class. I hardly ever used it, and when I did, I never felt enlightened beyond what I got from asking the professor."
2,not so good,"book is not so good. explanations are overcomplicated, even for simple issues. If you are beginner get ""Teach yourself Java in 21 days"" instead."
1,Vague and lacking in clear description,Extremely esoteric. Weiss is a terrible explaner of complicated ideas. Virtually every student in the Java class at my university complained about his terrible writing. DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK.
1,Not For Beginners,"I was required to purchase this text for my course. Having never programmed in java before and not having a strong programming background, I found this book almost impossible to follow. This book is definitely not for beginners and assumes previous knowledge of java. I did not find the explanations or examples in the book clearly written. After continued complaints from the class, the professor abandoned the book altogether after just 3 weeks. If your a beginner, stay away from this book."
2,Certainly not for beginners in OOP,"This book is a college textbook for my data structures java class. I was not new to programing at the start of my course, however I was new to OOP. This book does a horrible job of explaining the concept of OOP which, in my opinion, is difficult to grasp at first. The information in this book is very dense. Complex concepts are only given an explanation that is a page or two long (ex: Binary search trees). The examples aren't horrible, but they lack ample documentation. Now that I fully understand the concepts (thanks to the internet) this book makes an alright reference. Overall, if you already know Java or C++ or a similar OO language, this book is probably exactly what you need to learn how to store your data in Java, but if you don't know what OOP is, look elsewhere."
1,It was OK,"I just finished a data structures course where we used this book. The book is decent, but I know if I had not had earlier experience with C++, I would have been lost."
2,Incredibly slow shipping,"The book is helpful and I would recommend buying it for your classes, but if you do be prepared to wait at least 2 and a half weeks for your book to ship. The seller seems to be in no hurry to get the book to you in a timely manner. I would have bought it somewhere else if I had known this. Buy it from a bookstore instead, the slight price difference is not worth the ridiculous wait."
3,Great looking slingback...,"I had been scouring the internet for a pair of black, flat slingbacks to replace a pair that I love but had worn out. I was excited to find these shoes on-line, but was put off by a price tag of $115. In further searching, I found them here at Amazon for under $50. Hurray! I ordered them. The size 9's came promptly, but the left shoe was too narrow so I ordered a 9 1/2. Unfortunately, the same foot was still too narrow. Perhaps it would have stretched with wear, I never bought snakeskin before so I'm not sure, but at this price I couldn't take a chance so I had to return both pair.They are gorgeous shoes in person, though, and I'm sorry I had a size problem with them. I've bought lots of shoes on line, and never had to return any for size."
2,"Old Friends Andre' Previn, Mundell Lowe, Ray Brown","I don't like the live performance applause interrupting the music - before and after, okay ... musicians are fine; great. Audience, well ..."
4,The best Caldara recording available.,"It's worth noting that Metastasio's Passion text is not neither straight from a Gospel (as Schutz or Lassus) nor a dramatised narrative with reflective elements (as Bach, and the famous Brockes Passion text set by Telemann Handel and others), but rather a very personal dialogue between John, Peter, Mary Magadalene and Joseph of Arimathea.Nice recording from Biondi. The Marchi recording of Jommelli's 1749 setting of the same text on the K617 label is equally good."
5,Classic comedy at its finest!,"Leonard Part 6 is nothing short of brilliant. It is the perfect showcase for Billy Cosby's impeccable comic timing, and it also features several other Oscar-caliber performances in a script worthy of Moliere. This film brings to light several important topics of our time - vegeterianism, marital dysfunction and animal protection to name a few - without ever seeming preachy. It will keep you pondering these subjects for weeks. Complete with real belly laughs and serious overtones, Leonard Part 6 takes its place alongside Bringing Up Baby and Charlie Chaplin's Modern Times as one of the preeminent film comedies of the century."
3,"Underrated, not even his favorite, but a fun watch.","Ok, so what if ""Leonard, Part 6"" was not one of Cosby's best efforts? At least it was fun to watch even if it wasn't funny all the way through. Cos himself, realizing he was making a mistake, denounced the film, even accepted the razzies he won for it and even bought the TV rights so it wouldn't be seen on TV. It's just one of those cult films like The Rocky Horror Picture Show, Shock Treatment, Mommie Dearest and Attack of The Killer Tomatoes, it's so bad that it's good. I just happen to be one of those people who likes cult films and I guess LP6 is one of them."
5,Best Movie Ever!,It's about time this classic is being released on dvd. I only hope The Cos will one day appreciate this movie and finally produce the 5 prequels for Leonard's cult following. An animated series will suffice. MELTED BUTTER!
3,"The classic, horrible movie.","Leonard Pt. 6 is one of the single worst movies I have ever seen. That is what makes it so great. Low budget cable TV stations would probably choose to go off air instead of showing this garbage. But for some reason, I still enjoy watching this movie. For the balance between trash and enjoyment, I give it 3/5 stars."
1,The worst movie ever,"I have not watched this movie since going to the theater in 1987 to see it.To this day when I hear mention of a bad movie, I always ask, ""Have you seen Leonard Part 6""? More times than not, the fortunate souls say ""no"". Those unlucky few of us who have suffered the brain nummbing 90 minutes of our lives will never recoup that time.I am writing this as a service to anyone who feels that comedy should be funny and not so stupid that you laugh at the idea that someone paid to see it before you realize that you just paid to see it. This movie has got to be in the running for worst theatrical release ever. I'd rather watch a 5 mile snail race than subject myself to this mistreatment again. I am a Cosby fan and I love his work in other shows, but, this one proves that no matter how good an actor you are, you're not immune to something that flat out sucks."
1,"Well, the opening credits are pretty appalling, and after that..","Stupid stupid movieYou can enjoy it in a brainless sort of wayAnd whats with the ending, them putting food on poor Bill CosbyTo his credit, Bill advised people against seeing itJust dumb.. Heres a list: man blowing up after eating a hotdog (WTF?!)fish stopping to look at pornJust a terrible all around film. Probably very entertaining if you bring some friends around though!"
4,This is the WORST Movie I've ever seen in my life,"However, it is hilarious and I love it. It makes absolutely no sense at all and that's why it works. The reason why it works is it doesn't take itself too seriously (An ostrich in ballet slippers?) so it's easy to let yourself enjoy it. A true guilty pleasure.I do have one question. Are there really parts 1-5 or is this an urban legend?"
1,Baaaaaaaddddddd!,"My fiance and I are huge Cosby fans, so we knew we would love Leonard Pt 6. Boy were we wrong! We both like stupid movies a lot, ie-Napoleon Dynamite, Naked Gun, etc. but this was just too much. Scaring off attacking lobsters with melted butter is where I draw the line from stupid-funny to just plain stupid. Definately not one of Cosby's better moments. Definately rent before you buy!"
3,"""Tromp barefoot in the wet edging of the sea...""",The themes had a few touches that felt late '60's/early '70's - occasional odd references in clothing or race that seem out-moded now. But - the collection is sharp and well connected. It is great to watch Delany's mind playing with various themes; things that caught his attention worked out over a series of stories. I found myself watching for these moments. One such: the nature of hologram for storage - or more specifically - a fractional remainder of an original hologram. Delany teases this out in HIGH WEIR and in TIME AS A HELIX with very different characters & purposes. Some of the tales are a little fuzzy themselves - almost like a slice of something not fullly formed or finished - which is how the book closes with JOE DICOSTANZO. I think CORONA held my attention most - and it is one of the tales that smacks of the '60's. Great basic collection.
2,London symphony Orchestra,This rambling heavy handed interpretation of american classics is well... what the hell is it. They have tried to make these songs into mini symphonies and hello....it just doesnt work at all.There is a lot of Vivaldi and Ravel in the mix and its just a lot of boring music.I would have expected much better from London Symphony Orchestra
4,Great News for Lovers of Symphonic Rock Music,"This time the Lso does it again with Symphonic American Classics. This is a really good album, which covers some really great material. This is really one of the Lso's better albums (though certainly not their best). I think if you like the originals you will like this"
1,Shocking AWFUL!,I was excited to buy this movie because of the actors in it! What a mistake! This movie is PROOF that you cannot judge a movie by it's actors! Movie is weird and jumps around and just just plain BAD!
2,Dakini Lounge,"I didnot enjoy this CD. I usually love Prem Joshua--Sky Kisses Earth, Water Down the Ganges and Tales of a Dancing River--loved them. But this one was repetitive and dull. I missed all the exciting changes, rhythms and provacative moods provided by Prem Joshua recordings. This is literally a ""lounge around recording""."
5,Who is ZZ Top???,"This is the best I have heard so far... Sky High is fantastic, hope they will tour the US soon..."
2,Cannot open!,"My hands hurt from trying to open these bags... so much so that I can barely type this review! I've spent the last 35 minutes opening 20 of these bags. I had to take a break in order to (1) give my hands a rest, (2) google to see if there was a secret to opening bags (3) warn others of this travesty!"
1,Not the greatest,"I bought these bags because I was making cake pops for the holidays. I have a few points as to why they are not the greatest.1. They were too small for what I was trying to do.(that is my fault tho I should have made mine smaller.)2. You can get them open, you cant tell which end is the open end and which is the closed. I spent about, 10mins just trying to open one before I actually got it open.3. they are a bit high priced for ordering offline, when you can get the same brand at walmart for a 1.50."
2,Not too impressed!,"I purchased these for cake pops. My husband and I both tried to open them to no avail after 10 mins. Finally my almost 3 year old brought me a sticker and the light blub went off. I got two new stickers and placed one on each side near the ""open"" end, then pulled them apart and voila...they opened easily. Not the ideal way to open bags you spend money on, but it worked and I bagged 30 pops in 5 mins."
3,"Great, if you can get them open...","These bags, and the similar version in an hour-glass shape, are great for treats, cake pops, etc. They are good quality (thickness of the plastic) and look neater and more professional than plastic wrap. However (and this is a huge issue), they are very difficult to get open. Even if you know the trick (rubbing your thumb and index finger together at the top corner), it's a huge investment of time (we got about 8 open in 15 minutes the last time). Ridiculous! The product deserves 5 stars, but I had to knock two stars off for the hassle."
5,just what I needed,I was looking for a more reasonable way to cover my cake pops this really did the trick. I would recommend this to anyone.
2,Too hard to open,This product makes great covers... if you can get them open! They were like vacuum sealed shut so I couldn't get the open side to open up. I had to pry them open with a knife tip. It took me over an hour to bag 40 cake pops. I would shop around and see if you could find other brands that aren't stuck closed
1,really bad smell,"It took me 2 years to decide to write my first bad review.This perfume is really bad and discontinued by Kenzo.I ordered it because I had read some fake reviews and the truth is , it is so bad, I had to just throw it away."
2,Not so good,"The glasses and the necklace were good, the teeth are kind of useless like mentioned before except for maybe taking a picture - the wig in NO WAY resembles Austin Powers' hair, it is way too dark and just not even the right shape/style. It worked alright for my husband, but there are most likely alot better options out there."
1,not truly represented,When I received this kit it only contained the glasses and teeth despite the fact that it was advertised as a deluxe kit complete with the wig and medallion. Needless to say I was very disappointed! My attempts to contact the toy company were unsuccessful and I gave up. I spent way to much for some plastic teeth and glasses!!
4,"Mink Lungs rule! and are nice people, too.","This record has a little something for everyone. It starts very Brit-poppy, descends through multiple layers of sonic mesh, and has some surprising catch-you-off-guard emotional moments. Very promising. And it grows on you with multiple listenings. Hit The Better Button. P.S. Frosty rocks."
4,Starter,"This deck is good as a starter, as are most theme decks. As of now these cards aren't really tournament legal but if you are just looking to playing for fun this theme deck is a good way to start. So in short if you are interested in playing the game I recommend this."
5,Good value,"This power supply is a good value for the level of power it provides. I have had no issues with it after about six months of having it installed. However, I currently have it in an older computer, so I have not tested the limits of what it can handle."
4,Good basiq PSU,"I've had this for about 4 or so years. Initially it was in a system with a Pentium 4 CPU (2.8GHz northwood), 2GB RAM, and a Geforce 6200 card. 2 years ago, I upgraded to a Core i5 750, 4GB RAM, Geforce 210 graphics card. It's been fine with both. In fact with the second system, I overclocked the GPU quite a bit and this PSU has kept up. I also have 2 HDs and 2 ODDs on the second one, the first had just 1 HD. It would be nice to have more SATA connectors though, there's just 1 (more recent reviews say that it has 3 now though, at least on other sites). It feels a little warm on the top of the case where this is and the back though, but that's not a huge issue.I'm probably going to replace it though since I'm thinking about a GPU upgrade, and I've heard Antec's quality has gone down so I'll be looking at Seasonic or Corsair."
4,Antec BP500U Power Supply Unit,"The first Antec Power Supply BP500U was defective and would not start up Windows. I emailed them right away and in 2 days I received another one. This one worked. Geovanne's Attic receives a 100% and AAA's in my book. They can't help it when products don't meet up to specs or are damaged, but, they do everything in their power to make it right.THANK YOU GEOVANNE'S ATTIC."
2,Recently started to make loud noises.,"My friend installed a new Antec Basiq 500 Watt ATX Power Supply/PSU (BP500U) on 1/23/2010 into my PC with a dead non-Antec previous PSU meltdown. Lately, its PSU fan has been making loud noises. I noticed different its fan output, has noticeable changes in air output and vibrations, between its quietness and noises. Why is it already making noises? It doesn't look too dusty yet either. And I do agree the fan is louder than other PSUs' fans when it is not making horrible noises."
4,Brought new life to my aging Dell Dimension 2200,My Dell Dimension 2200 Tower computer bit the dust. The fan wasn't moving so I got out the multimeter and confirmed that no voltage was coming out of the power supply. Did some research on the internet and found the Antec Basiq BP350 to be compatible with the Dell 2200 and well rated by those who had purchased it.I wholehearted concur. I have been using in my Dell 2200 for a few months and have had no issues. Its fan doesn't seem to be any louder than my previous power supply as some others have complained.My computer is like new again (well like it was when it was new in 2002)!
5,Perfect,"Perfect price, powers my MATX build like a pro. Runs a little toasty (bad cooling design) when under alot of power draw. Otherwise perfect build option."
1,Ho hum,"Nice power supply number, nice price, nice features, died less than a week. Lucky for me amazon gave me a full refund no questions asked, and i bought me a nice power supply from hec, aka compucase. This is the power supply i bought, practicly the same price, way better product over all. New HEC Xpower Pro 650W Power Supply High Energy Power With Low Ripple Noise Super Quiet Technology"
1,Burns out,"I am an IT guy and pretty good fan of Antec. But it looks like that this model, ""BP500U"" has come out to be a lemon. I have gone through 3 of them so far in the past month. and not just on one machine. So it cannot be something in my computer that is causing the problem. Try to get another brand or model."
3,OK Power supply,Strikes me as a very cheaply made power supply sold for a bit more under the Antec brand name. Appears to be OK quality - probably comparable to OEM supply in my case. Appears to work fine. Seems like I go through power supplies every couple of years for whatever reason. This is my third power supply in the 5 years I have had my mid-tower case. Last one was a 2-fan 400W Antec of obviously higher quality than this one - but this time I didn't feel like paying the extra for this old PC. I leave PC on all the time - have 2CD/2HD/floppy. When PS goes it has always been on reboot after shutting down 1+ week for vacation.
3,Modular Power supplies,"This was the only ANTEC supply still available with modular power connectors. My previous Supply was the ANTEC Smartpower 2.that had modular power connectors. This supply had a 3 year warranty but failed after 18 months. Unfortunately I did not find my receipt for it. I don't know why they discontinued this model. The reason I chose the BP 550 was the modular concept was very handy by not having to disconnect and retie all the old loose power connectors. The connectors simply plugged into the new supply. As it turned out, I was able to find the problem with the old supply and repair it. I was disappointed that the new supply has a one year warranty ,although they priced out about the same."
2,antec disappoints again,"This is the second antec that does not work or does not supply enough power. I intuitively knew, and since I am a prof psychic, did I listen?it said buy the other choice. So who pays for shipping to replace it?the first one i got came with the case, and not enough power for a p II and now this one, 500 wats and new didn't book. motherboard got the power computer nothingNO NO NO to ANTEC"
1,Sent me a malfunctioning product.,"I installed this power supply and a new cpu cooler on the same day. My computer started freezing on that day and I thought it was a cooling problem so I spent 2 months contacting cooler master to get my product returned and refunded. After getting a new cooler the freezing persists and after some tests I find its due to the power supply. Being way after the amazon return date I contacted Antec support to have someone make due on my warranty, but if you don't return the product 60 days after the date of purchase the warranty won't cover replacements. Which is absolutely insane being that its a 3 year warranty. Will be a long time before I buy anything from Antec."
4,Antec BP550 Plus 550W ATX12V V2.2 Modular Power Supply,"Im not an electronics whiz at the least. Friend suggested this for a low cost dependable power supply to go with new video card, I installed both myself!! which is amazing....Very simple does its job pushing new video card , 0 problems so far since purchase in june/09"
5,Valuable!,"I got a value, this book helps me in grammar. Easy to learn, and the content is simply like the second edition. Very fast delivery so that I could bring that in class at the first day."
5,Awesome,"An awesome seller, they said the book was new, and they meant it. I had ordered this book on a Friday, and got it by the following Tuesday."
1,Pathetic. Below pathetic.,"The book is basically seven chapters of recycled creationist arguments from Behe to let's assume the Bible is true because you assume Thomas Jefferson existed and the Bible says evolution is false. You can read a Jack Chick tract for the same ""cogent"" arguments.The final chapter where he ""stops being Einstein's chauffeur"" (an urban legend by the way) and makes his own argument. His argument is basically John Lennon was brutally murdered by a fundamentalist Christian therefore you should be a Christian. The only time he stops recycling ignorant creationist arguments and odd claims that we should just accept the Bible because mathematic systems can't prove themselves while being internally consistent, he does so to dance on John Lennon's corpse for the same reason John Lennon was shot.I'm going to throw my copy away. I got it from the free bin of a yard sale and paid far too much."
2,Not the Best,I bought 3 of these so the my daughter and her cousins wouldn't fight over the same one. They are pretty small and 1 of them wouldn't fly at all. The kids age 5 to 7 had a hard time getting the 2 that worked to fly at the beach (adult intervention was required).
5,"Great Product, A+++Seller","I used this product on my hair and on my dog, It turned out great for the both of us.I will definitely purchase again"
3,Mixed Bag of Tricks and Treats.,"This Halloween CD is a mixed-bag. The first six songs on the album are Halloween-themed songs sung by Winnie the Pooh, Tiger, Mickey Mouse, Goofy, and other Disney characters. None of these songs are really scary, but they do talk about things that could scare very young listeners, e.g. witches, werewolves, skeletons, etc. The second half of the CD includes six tracks of spooky situations in sound, e.g. night creatures, haunted house, encounter in the fog, etc. Some of the sound tracks are quite spooky and can be used for background music for a Halloween party. However, children will probably not enjoy listening to these tracks. Overall, HALLOWEEN SONGS AND SOUNDS is a mixed album of songs from Disney that includes both kiddy-oriented Halloween tunes and very spooky Halloween sound effects."
2,Cobra 4500,"I have to say that this gps is really really bulky. If you want to be able to be able to carry this around then it is not the right gps for you. I was also very disappointed in that this unit does not have any internal battery so you cannot even update the software from cobra website unless you have a laptop that you can take to your car and a mini usb cord which cobra somehow assumes that you already have. The software is ok and has alot of options like avoiding tolls and certain streets however, the overall unit as a whole even with the larger screen does not even compare to that of garmin products such the nuvi 3 series, which is lighter, more portable, more user friendly, and actually have battery power that you can search for locations at home and update software from the comfort of your home. Those are my 2 cents on this unit."
1,Cobra 4500,The unit is very large and bulky. It does have a very large viewable map which is nice. The unit I had worked about 1 week then would not power up. I am completely dissapointed with this brand and unit and am trying another one.
5,Very pleased.,"My husband is using The cobra Nav one,he is a truck driver and it is working real well for him.He is very pleased with it..It is giving him information he needs.Very Happy with this product."
1,4 hr trip takes 6 1/2hrs with cobra 4500 ????????,"just just received my cobra nav one on the jan.22 love the device but its flawed i took a trip to sanford fl from miami it told me to get off major highway to take US1 , i didn't take its advice and keep going. got there in record time.. but...... on the way back it took my through residental areas when i could visibly see I-4 & 417 the trip home took me home on the back roads and 6hrs later i made it home"
5,"simply the best (if you have the answers to the exercises, that is)","I normally start a language by learning the rules for handling nouns and basic sentence structure, whereas Reimann's book starts off with verbs, verb forms, and tenses. This has not been an impediment to getting a lot out of this book, because the chapters are modular enough to be usable in any order you want. This is a particularly useful feature as it allows you to look up whatever it is you are having trouble with, and work on it.The exercises are excellent and progress from the very easy to the challenging. However, to really get anything out of them, you will need to purchase the answer keys (sold separately).The best thing about this book, however, is that it makes german grammar which can be dry and difficult, accessible even to those of us who for whom grammar is a painful memory from school and only speak our own mother tongues because of an intuitive understanding of the underlying rules and structures."
3,a lot of halo,"These binocs suffer from a lot of light haloing around the edges. Internal reflection, lack of coatings? I don't know. I'm comparing them to my other binocs, Zeiss 10x25 and Pentax 10x42 WP. The image is sharp and they work well with glasses. The depth of field is not great so Pentax should have made the focusing knob a bit bigger.I suppose you get what you pay for."
2,"Returned, Poor Collimation+","Tried these out on 2 different days, 1 cloudy and 1 sunny. 2-2hr hikes along the river.1) Poor Collimation. Never once got that snap-there is the right focus. Continually adjusting the focus.2) Bino's do not fit in the case while the Eye cups are fully extended. The ready to go position for me. Pretty much eliminates them for use on Birds. (Even without the eye cap/protectors on!)3) Case is cheap felt on the inside, In less then 1 hour had fuzzy's all over the lenses.4) Eye cap protector doesn't have a good spot to connect the strap. If you wanted to use the strap and hang them from your neck.I had to give 2 stars for the specs like waterproofing, lightweight ect. but #1 has to be at least ok/good optics. That's the whole Idea for a binocular?"
2,Didn't work very well,"Have used Toko and Swix products for many years without issue. I tried this when my brother gave me a chunk of his Hertel wax and a glowing recommendation. Maybe it was a bad batch, but it did not perform well at all."
4,Very good value and great website info!,"This was my first attempt at hot waxing skis and I'll have to say it was very easy. The instructions provided with the wax were simple and clear, and my snowboarder friend also showed me how. We ski casually about once per week in different snow conditions, and the wax seems to be lasting well after 3 weeks. I read all the reviews here before purchasing, and I believe it lives up to what others have said about a good all around wax for the price."
4,doesn't weigh 3/4 lb.,"Good wax, but didn't weigh in at 3/4 lbs though. The one I got had a large chunk taken out of the back, eliminating about 15% of the volume. I did weigh the block to verify too. If you're shopping based on weight, you'd better take that into account. Otherwise, this wax works as well as any other I've tried."
4,all temperature with small compromise,"I'm not sold on ""all temperature"" but haven't had opportunity to try this wax in extreme warm or cold yet. It works well in typical winter temperature ranges, I've skied this wax from teen's to low mid-30's Fahrenheit and it's done the job. I don't think it's as slick as temp specific Swix waxes, but the rest of my family can't tell the difference. No racers here, just recreational skiers and a retired instructor, so this will do. And regardless of ""all temperature"" the price just can't be beat."
3,"Hertel's ""Super Hot Sauce""","I found this product to be ""OK""! It went on well, holds up good, not as slippery as I expected it to be. I'm comparing it to professional shops that do waxing and a sample I received with my home wax kit. It didn't live up to it's name ""Super Hot Sauce"" The product was good enough that I brought their racing wax with the expectation that it will be superior. Not sure if I need racing wax, but I'll give it a try."
4,Reasonable Price - Fast Skis,"I wax skis for a family of five and was tired of selecting from a variety of waxes like I used to do during my racing days. This wax is relatively soft, applies well with an iron, and scrapes off easily. At the mountain, everyone had ""fast"" skis"". It's rewarding to see your whole family passing people who don't wax their skis while on a long traverse. Skis perform better as well. Like most waxes, it will last for a couple days of hard skiing before needing reapplication."
5,"Next best thing to a German Wella, which is now out of production","Unfortunately, my favorite, more costly, but silent and sharp Wella Contura has been unavailable for more than a year.The Andis T-edger II rechargeable, a U.S. made device, has a precision ground sharp cutter, not too noisy, and comes with length control comb attachments 1/16 inch and up) that work better than that on the Wella that reduced cutting efficiency--these don't. When the Wella quit entirely, I bought this and have been quite pleased. Holds its charge for a long time. Needs a piece of 3M packing tape over the switch to keep it off when traveling, but the Wella did too.I bought mine from another source and paid 25% more than the price here at the time of this review, so the price is right, too."
5,Great tribute to Nat King Cole,"This is mainstream, easy-listening jazz. These are instrumental arrangements of songs for which Nat King Cole was famous, including ""Nature Boy"" (my favorite). The Trio is made up of piano, bass and guitar. This is superb music, played beautifully, and with great sound. A winner all around."
3,charger and battery pack,I purchased this because it said that it fit Imaginext Spike the dinosaur. The connections were not exactly the same but works if you force the connedtions together
2,Not a book for advance NT/2000 Admins,"The theory part of the book is very basic. IP addressing, DNS, and other Windows NT/2000 essentials were discussed as if the reader is just starting to learn NT/2000. I was hoping to see some ""Best Practices"", Performance Tuning, and Design Guidelines on implementing Clustering on Exchange and SQL. The Step-by-Step guide in installing and configuring Cluster Server is good though, so I gave it 2 stars."
3,Entry Level - Expected more,"If you've never clustered servers, this is a start. If you expect to learn in depth about geographically dispersed clusters, quorum recovery, or other such advanced topics, you won't find it here. Lot's of good ol' boy discussion, but found myself searching for the beef.Microsoft has a SQL cluster guide on their site, and NetApp has a whitepaper on SQL clustering using their storage which is VERY descriptive. Both are free and would give you a condensed, concise version of getting started without the fluff."
5,Great all-purpose SQL Server developer's book,"I bought this book at the same time I got Veria's book and this one is by far the better of the two. Where Rob's book just skims the surface of important topics, this book actually goes into the details. You can definitely tell these guys write real applications. Definitely a recommended buy."
1,Very disappointed with the book.,This book reads more like an online help book. There are no explanations of the logic of using the syntax. This book will put you to sleep. I don't recommend getting this book at all.
2,Impossible to mix,"Both components are so thick, that it's very difficult to extract them out of the can. Once it's out, it's difficult to mix. Takes looooong time to harden. Disappointed overall."
2,Not what I expected.,"I was searching for a 1 to 1 epoxy paste that I used to use when I repaired yachts in Florida a few years ago. This is not it. Too thick and too dark in color. Very difficult to mix. Might be good for sealing up plumbing leaks. Has more of a gum quality and less of a ""paste"" texture."
2,Doesn't work well at all,"There's no ""off"" button - this is a piece of garbage. Don't even waste your time or money on this."
2,silliness,At times interesting and engaging but the final wrap up was terrible. Impossible to believe the ending while leaving the real resolutions I imagine to the next novel which I for one will be passing on.
1,Very disappointing,"I've always loved this series, and Martha Grimes is clearly a gifted writer. However, I'm beginning to feel that authors should know when to end a series. I'm not surprised Knopf didn't want to publish any more in this one--I often think it should have ended after ""The Old Contemptibles."" This latest offering is no more than excuse to trot out all the cliches in the series--the regular characters, who in no way advance the plot (why does Melrose need to infiltrate Declan Scott's household??), which is barely discernible in any case, the stock children, who in no way resemble any child I've ever encountered. Jury's personal angst, which lingers on and on, from book to book. Enough is enough. Also, I quite agree with the reader who objected to Grimes' description of a child with Down syndrome. I was shocked to read those pages, particularly Wiggins' aversion to the boy. I don't know what message that was meant to send."
4,"Interesting story, hard to stop listening to the CDs before the end.","I love Martha Grimes' books. This may be one of my favorites. The only thing I didn't like was the last few minutes at the end, which led into ""The Old Wine Shades"" a bit far. If I hadn't listened to that one before this, it might not have been any problem."
2,extremely disappointing,Such a disjointed novel that I don't know where to begin with what is wrong.I know that child abductions are not rare but to have 4 different characters with an abducted or murdered girl child in their past is a bit too much for belief isn't it? I mean England is not that populous and filled with perverts.All I can hope is that this is an errant Jury mystery and that better will come my way. BTW is it just me or does it seem that Melrose Plant and Jury are essentially the same person with different names. And that last chapter was absolutely superflous and pointless. I kept thinking it was the lead-off chapter to the next book and actually looked to see if that was so because it made no sense in the context of the book.
1,Hack writing,"This is a very disappointing tome from one whose earlier works were so bright with descriptive prose and pinpoint characterization. Ms. Grimes has fallen into the hackneyed manner of most American writers and has allowed skimpy dialogue to develop plot and character. The book is a ""quick read"". The weighty subject matter of this volume is full of ideas just waiting break loose and emerge from murky depths, but this novel has all the murky depths of a well-kept California swimming pool. Ms. Grimes is capable of so much more."
3,A purloined child,"I would have to agree with a previous reviewer that the story wanders a bit. The basic plot is good, but the author has her usual habit of inserting extraneous material. While Richard Jury is working on the case he is sidetracked by the death of his cousin, and doubts about the memories of his youth. His rich friend, Melrose Plant, is brought into the case but contributes very little. There is a final digression into Long Piddleton that really has nothing to do with the case. Naming the goat, etc., might be interesting as a separate short story but has nothing to do with the present case.The main plot about pedophilia and the missing child is very good, but it would have been better if the author would have left out some of the excess baggage that she is prone to adding into her novels. She has a fixation on Long Piddleton."
2,Absolute Rubbish!!,"For all Jane Austen fans out there, do not spend your money on this infantile attempt to recreate the world of Pride and Prejudice. The author uses no original ideas and even borrows the names of her characters from other novels/titles by Austen. Elizabeth Bennet Darcy is reduced to a simpering, watered down, whining social busy body who barely leaves the confines of Pemberley to develope more as a character. In fact if this were a play, it could be very convincely played as a single actor who experiences the complete book within her mind. ""Are the shades of Pemberley to be thus polluted?"" Not one character is of consequence within this book. If you must read this book, go to your local library and read it on someone else's dime."
3,Not bad,"I'm an avid Jane Austen fan... I enjoyed reading this book, but felt that it was not what I had hoped it would be. Don't get me wrong, it's a nice easy read, but I don't feel it does justice to the characters Jane Austen so wonderfully portrayed..."
2,Letters from Pemberley the First Year,This is a sweet book but no real suprises and everything turned out just perfect in the neat little boxes some might imagine that it would. The reading is easy and but the letters only come from Elizabeth and that can get a little slow at some points. There were no real challenges faced by the couple and for the reader use to escaping reality in these perfect worlds may still find this a bit much. All in all not the worst P&P sequel but far from the best
4,Charming,"A lovely, gentle tale. Through the somewhat sketchy medium of letters, the author implies rather than narrates the story. She allows us to draw on our previous experiences with Jane Austen's characters to fill in the blanks."
3,A little too pat...,"A fun read, but not a page-turner anything close to the original. Very light reading, suitable for standing in line at the DMV to kill time."
3,Letters from pemberlys' unoriginal characters,"I'm not sure how many people that are going to read this book are Jane Austen fans or just fans of Pride and Prejudice. But most of the new characters that Jane Dawkins creates are taken from the book Emma. She has given Mr. Knightley the name Mr. Daley, and his wife Emma becomes Margaret. Also involved are the Eltons. This may not bother many people, but involving them was ridiculous and confusing. She may have well as kept their normal names and had them meet. There would be a good book that I would jump at the chance to read!"
3,A pleasant read...,"This is the second P&P; sequel that I have read. I admit that I had many misgivings about reading a sequel, certain that no author could quite match Jane Austen's style and wit.This author has come the closest of the two (the other being Berdoll) but this book is not my favorite. While she does stay true to Austen's style, Dawkins does not manage to inspire as much interest in the characters. In short, nothing much happens in the book. We get all of our information secondhand, from Elizabeth. Her letters are, of course, witty but there is much detail left out that one would wish to know. Therefore, in my opinion, the book falls short. I did enjoy the book, however, and finished it in under 4 hours."
3,Dry,Not so great - due to my expectations? You'll find the characters and (sort of) the language style you're used to; but where is the sardonic wit that is the core of Austen?
5,Please! Tell a friend.,"Echoing the comment of the reader from Billings Montana, if you enjoyed Letters from Pemberly, tell a friend! And what better way of doing it than through Amazon reader reviews! I bought this book on strength of its reviews and was completely delighted! If you are an Austen fan, and even more a Pride and Prejudice fan (as I am), this book should be ""required reading""!"
3,A pleasant read,This was a very easy read. I finished it in just a couple of hours. It was an enjoyable and likely depiction of what may have happened after the conclusion of PnP. I read all the PnP sequels and find Letters from Pemberley one of the better ones.
3,Captures the Style,"This is a book Jane Austen lovers will enjoy. It is in the same style as Pride and Prejudice, partly because the author has lifted phrases and entire sentences from Pride and Prejudice (which she admits in her introduction). Her descriptions of Pemberley and daily life in the early nineteenth century are interesting. The story is told as letters from Lizzy to Jane during her first year of marriage. The diplomacy that a lady would have used in her letters may have contributed to the thinness of the plot and the sketchiness of the characters. I think that given the personalities of Lizzy and Mr. Darcy and their different backgrounds, there should have been more conflicts between them during the first year. In ""Letters"" Lizzy only talks of her ""dear husband"" and how wonderful he is. It is a good book to relive the spirit of Pride and Prejudice, but it might have difficulty standing alone as a work of fiction."
4,This is a keeper!,"This was an easy, fast read, that I think anyone would enjoy. It isn't fast moving like some of the other sequels because the stories are related through Lizzy's letters to Jane. But the writing is thoughtful, not a careless word written. Elizabeth's humor is evident and I found myself chuckling often as she muses about other characters she encounters and of her growing relationship this first year with Darcy. I also liked how Dawkins mixed several of other Austen's characters from other novels and puzzling out the characters that she often cleverly renamed, ie. The Knightley's as The Daley's. It was rather enjoyable to see how The Darcy's ""behaved amongst others."" This is a keeper. In fact I am going to buy More Letters from Pemberley next!"
2,Rather insipid...but perfectly tolerable,"I cant say this book was very stimulating. I read this after reading Pamela Aidens trilogy (a much better read) on Fitzwilliam Darcy. Elizabeths letters to Jane and pleasant and what you would expect letters to family of that time to be - superficial and full of ""I met so and so blah blah blah"". THe book is a light airport read, but if you after somthing that could reveal more of the relationship between Elizabeth or Fitzwilliam, you will be disapointed."
3,"sweet, not sharp","I can see why Austen fans have reviewed this positively -- Dawkins does an admirable job of imitating Austen's language, and it is fun to play guess-which-Austen-character-this-is as she creates the community around Pemberley. The letters are relentlessly sweet, though, and lack the satiric sharpness that made Austen more than just another romance novelist. Lizzy and Darcy are recreated in a fairly superficial way here -- no surprises, no tension. It's a pleasant exercise in nostalgia, but not a satisfying continuation."
5,Excellent,"I loved this book. Part of what I like about Jane Austen is the way she writes, of course, no one can live (or in this case, write) up to her standards. I thought that Jane Dawkins really portrayed the characters well, and I ended up smiling several times through the book, especially letter 25. All of them seemed to, at least, SOUND like our beloved Lizzy. Mr. Darcy is, well, Mr. Darcy. I also loved the fact that characters from other books appeared! (The Daleys are the Knightleys, Sir Richard Mansfield and his helping out a relative and her two daughters, who are all sense and sensibility.) I was delighted, overjoyed, HAPPY, with this book. A sequel to a Jane Austen book is not easy, and Jane Dawkins pleasantly surprised me."
3,The Wonderbread of JA sequels,"""Letters from Pemberley"" is simple and tasty, but, like Wonderbread, it's far from the creme de la creme. A great deal of the fanfic on the Republic of Pemberley (pemberley.com) is much more substantial (meat and potatoes, I'd say). There are a few cute jokes, but mostly it is just a sweet story of Elizabeth Bennet's life after marriage to the mysterious Mr. Darcy. Jane Dawkins has captured Austen's style quite well, but she's simply not that talented. Worth a read if you've got the time, but don't expect anything out of the ordinary."
2,A Miniscule Bit of Ivory,"Written very much in the [Jane] Austen style, but lacking any real storyline. The author seems more content to excessively drop names of characters from the other Austen novels, then to explore the married life of Mr. & Mrs. Darcy."
2,Boring,I found this book boring and not up to the reviews I read here. It didn't have the same sense of sly humor present in Austen's work.
3,"Good, but not Perfect","I love the fact that others want Pride and Prejudice continued. I liked the story line and how everything happened. It was a good read. I don't know that I felt the styling was as Jane Austen as it was rumored. I know the book is called Letters from Pemberly, but I would have like to read letters from Jane too."
3,handwriting class,"This is one of the more insipid P&P spinoffs, better used for handwriting class. The author lacks imaginiation and creativity and writes letters too banal for words. The idea of populating the book with other Austen characters is good, too bad she fails to do anything with them. Is this all there is? This book have us all asleep before the fire, right along with Bingley's brother in law!"
4,Great! But...,"I really enjoyed this book hence the 2 hours (with interruptions) it took me to read it! But...yes, there is a but... there are a couple of things that stopped me from giving it 5 stars. Firstly, like a few other readers, i found Lizzy a little...down. It really did seem as if she was not enjoying her new life at Pemberly. Even if she argued to Jane otherwise! I would almost say she sounded depressed? Secondly, the one sided-ness of the letters was a little disappointing. Granted it is about Lizzy's life at Pemberly, it would have been nice to hear about Jane's new life with Bingley or Lydia's troublesome ways from their own mouths and manner. Nonetheless, I really did enjoy the book and recommend it to other Pride and Prejudice fans. Or anyone who just can't let the ending of Pride and Prejudice be just that."
3,Eh...it was alright.,"This novel is a collection of letters from Elizabeth Darcy to Jane Bingley during the first year of both of their marriages. While it stays true to characterizations, it has no plotline...which wouldn't be so bad in itself, except it was dreadfully dull. The letters were like, ""we went to this party, we met these people...this is what I thought of them...we're doing some improvements on Pemberley, can't wait to see you, yours &tc."" It wasn't bad, really, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone."
2,Check your purchase immediately for freshness,"I bought these for my 17 & 1/2 year old cat. I just opened a bottle with a ""use by date"" of 3/14 (March 2014). When I opened a capsule from this newly opened bottle and went to sprinkle it on Tiggys yogurt a chunk fell out and nothing more. Thinking it must just be a bad capsule I tried another. Same result. When I went to return this bottle that had not had the seal broken until today I found that I would not get a full refund and would have to pay for return shipping as well.I would suggest that when you receive these that you check them right away by opening a capsule and making sure it's got powder inside and isn't dried up (and maybe worthless) Q10 inside.Live and learn... I will not make the same mistake again!=^..^="
4,A supplement CoQ10 review,"I just began taking this but it is supposed to help with energy, lower blood pressure and good for your heart health, this may take several weeks to exhibit the change but I am relatively healthy and not on any medication currently."
1,LAME - DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME,"This movie was sooooo boring. You should avoid this and watch the Justice League cartoons from cartoon network. And if you are looking for original movies based on the stories from the comics, then watch Batman/Superman: Public Enemies."
4,A good solid DC movie,"I was very impressed with the story line and how everything flowed together. I was a little shocked that the Crime Syndicate were not twins of our Justice League as it had been in the JLU series, but it worked better that way. I wish there would have been more fight scenes but the movie itself was very watchable. After seeing more of Owlman I think it is safe to say that he needs his own movie to tell his story on how he became the man that he is. My only gripe is (and yes I am one of those people)Batman is just not Batman without Kevin Conroy doing his voice. All in all this was worth the money and I hope to see many more DC anime films and hopefully a return of the animated series."
4,Justice League here and now,"I would be happy with any version of Justice League, but it would have hadmore of an impact for me if the original cast members like: George Newbern (Superman),Kevin Conroy (Batman), Phil Lamar (Green Lantern), Carl Lumbly (J'onn J'onzz),Susan Eisenberg (Wonder Woman), Clancy Brown (Lex Luthor), Michael Rosenbaum(Flash) and Maria Canals-Barrera (Hawkgirl) would have been the actors for thismovie - these actors are irreplaceable. Overall, the movie was awesome (presentcast members included) - showing how everyone could come together when the worldwas in danger. I am a big fan and will continue to purchase any form of JusticeLeague animation."
4,good,I enjoyed this movie and the story. Not much to really say about it other than it was entertaining to watch.
4,Earth-3 Finally Gets Its Due,"This movie has been a long time coming; the alternate universe villains are, of course, from Earth-3, where Luthor is a good guy and the superbeings are the bad guys; I want to say it was a 1964 story. Of course, it's been updated for the modern audience, and does well in doing so.DC may not have its act together on the live-action stuff but their animated movies (and TV shows) are doing very well indeed."
4,No Kevin Conroy?,"Good movie, only thing that bothered me was that Kevin Conroy or THE BATMAN was substituted by William Baldwin. He didnt do too bad but the movie would have been sooooo much better with the real voice of Batman. Must be Arkham 2 that is taking up most of his time at the moment but I dont understand why Bruce Timm who always casts Kevin Conroy as Batman did not do so for this movie. I liked James Woods as Owlman, hell of a villain as usual. Still I liked the movie and am awaiting Batman: Under the Red Hood. Thanks Bruce Timm!"
3,It was ok could have been better,The way it could have been better if they had Kevin conroy as batman not that boldwin and the movie is ok not great but so I give it 3/5 stars wish Kevin was in it
3,"Fun to Watch, painful at timed to hear.","After hearing all of the complaints about the voices, I was expecting the worst, but was pleasantly surprised overall in the voice casting. Ironically, as pleased as I was with most of the voices, I couldn't buy the voices for ""Lex."" or ""Batman"" and it was distracting. Clancy Brown's ""Lex"" has presence, and if they wanted to go away from Clancy, it would be fine as long as they got a voice more distinctive. Batman's voice was terrible. I know Kevin Conroy can't be Batman forever, but couldn't you have borrowed the Brave and the Bold Batman voice? TBATB Batman's voice is decent and passable, but this one was dreadful.I liked watching the movie, but couldn't help but want a better Lex or Batman voice. Again, better casting needs to be made for roles such as these two characters. They did a good job with the other voices, and even Superman was surprising good."
2,It was a little less than ok,"Pretty much says it in the title. I absolutely love DC comics and about 95% of their of their movies. In fact DC Comics helped me decide what I want to do with my life, thats why I hate giving them less than amazing reviews. This movie was an amazing idea and I had high hopes for it, but I was let down. All I really gotta say is: William Baldwin as BATMAN?????? REALLY????? That killed 35% of the movie for me and then Batman is supposed to be a genius, but in this movie he seemed about half the intelligence he actually has....."
3,just okay,"1 - art = 9/102 - story = 8/103 - voices = 6/10.Batman's voice was terrible, not even remotely like the dark night on JLA and JLU.Movie is too short, it should be a full featured movie.The Syndicate was not as ""evil"" as indicated, probably due to the ""PG-13"" rating.The ending was poor. As evil as Ultraman is he would have fought to the end instead of giving up. ""Nuking"" the place would only permit them to travel to earth, now weapons that contains blue kryptonite would be a different story."
2,don't like it,the story is so so. Batman looks really ugly too. Don't like the ending of the Flash of the other dimension either.
3,Oops - wish I knew that was in the movie before I bought it for a kid,"Great story. It is rated pg13 but for mild violence. Nowhere does it mention that is also contains some language I would have preferred my child not hear, like ""what the hell,"" ""oh crap,"" and ""get your a** off my planet."" Just beware of that..."
3,it's been done... but now with a twist!,"This movie was ok at best... worth a watch if you can get it for cheap.Honestly I'm kind of tired of seeing them rehash episode ideas into standalone movies.I know I've seen an episode of Justice League where the Justice League from an alternate universe started ruling with an iron fist after Flash was killed and Superman decided murder was an acceptable means to end a situation then come into conflict with the straight and narrow JLA we all know. Yeah basically take that idea, turn the alt. universe JLA into an organized crime syndicate where batman has watched Watchmen one time too many and decided the only thing cooler than Night Owl and Rorschach is Night Owl merged with Rorschach and happens to be a villain. Throw in the obligatory ""destroy all universes"" plot and that's basically what this movie is.worth a watch, but nothing to overly praise about."
1,Digital Copy Biased towards Windows Only,"With more and more Blu-Ray titles released with Digital Copies, I was disappointed to find that my Blu-Ray copy of Justice League : Crisis On Two Earths only allowed for a Windows Media Digital Copy. Not iTunes, not for the Mac. I would give more stars for the quality of the movie itself, but the fact that the Blu-Ray and its Digital Copy factor into the total cost of the Blu-Ray makes me think I might have been at a monetary disadvantage as a Mac user as compared to Windows users. This movie is available for purchase on iTunes and if I wanted to, I would have to pay more for what a Windows user is basically getting with their Blu-Ray. WB does allow Digital Copy downloads through iTunes for other movies, but not this. Why so selective?"
4,Great Movie,"Great movie the best one after Superman Batman:Public Enemies.James Woods and Gina Torres were great Owlman and Superwoman, I didn't care if they use the original DCAU continuity. Dwayne McDuffie can write some badass stories and is one of the best at it,But I wish there would have used Tim Daly,Kevin Conroy,Susan Eisenberg,Michael Rosenbaum,Carl Lumby,Clancy Brown,Ron Perlman and Christopher Meloni from Green Lantern: First Flight it would have made the characters sound so much better (IMO)"
3,Crisis on 2 Earths short and sweet,"What was Andrea Romano thinking ? When it comes to playing The Batman, William Baldwin is not as good as Kevin Conroy. James Woods is as brilliant as Owlman as Baldwin is inadequate as the Batman and the scenes with the two characters prove my point.The story is well written the pace great. The only thing that keeps Crisis on Two Earths from being 5 stars is not casting Kevin Conroy or someone with equal vocal depth and range."
4,Justice League dvd,This is another comic book series made into a movie. It is a great movie from comic book. It is interesting for super hero fans.
4,good,"good movie.i realy like ultra man, the opposite of superman, the boss of the bossesthe story is good, good fight too, but, there is always something in all thosemovie, i dont know how to explain, but, the movie could be better. not that he is not cool, butits correct. the best movie still green lantern and wonder woman (strange, i didnt know theme very well)"
4,"Good movie,but familiar voices would have made it better!","I enjoyed this movie,but it would have been much better with the voices we are familiar with. I love Mark Harmon on NCIS,but somehow his voice just doesn't fit the character of Superman. Same with Batman & Lex-the voices just didn't do the characters justice. I loved the lithograph that was included-nice touch with that. My favorite character was the alternate Flash,called Johnny Quick-he definitely beats the Flash when it comes to being cocky!! Although I didn't like the voices all that much,I would recommend this movie for anyone who is a Justice League fan."
4,Well done for an animation piece,"The Justice League visits a parallel Earth to help its one remaining super hero (Lex Luthor) versus evil counterparts to the Justice League. Voices of William Baldwin, Gina Torres and James Woods (Owlman, the evil counterpart to Batman). MY GRADE: B to B plus (but only if you like the super hero archetypes; BEST DIALOGUE (Bat man to Owlman): ""We are different in one way. We both looked into the Abyss but when you looked you blinked."""
4,Justice League DVDs,"Another great DVD for young people, especially those thrilled with Superman, Batman, etc. Nice DVD for the price!"
4,Making DC Accessible,"While I am a comics fan, I grew up with Marvel. Thus I have not read a lot of the classic alternate world stories published by DC until I started teaching about them in class. Justice League: Crisis on Two Earths delivers what the classic stories always do, superhero team-ups and alternative worlds. The story, written by Dwayne McDuffie, a talent writer I really admire, is solid in every respect. The entire cast of character gets something to do and the appearance of ""good"" Lex Luthor is always a treat. All in all, well worth the price, especially when you add-in the great extras on the disc."
2,Just Ice Lettuce,Not a particularly good make of an interesting plotline. the animation is pretty primitive for the time and the acting is often wooden.
3,It was good Just......,"I enjoyed this movie. It was a well written story I only had one real complaint The choices of voice actors for Superman & Batman. Mark Harmon and William Baldwin are excellent actors but in these roles they felt flat ,they were missing something and you can feel it while watching the film. If the DC folks would have been smart they would have used Kevin Conroy & Tim Daley for these parts instead of Superman/Batman: Public Enemies it would have been probably DC best Project to Date But Chris North as Luthor and A Super performance by James Woods as Olwman saves it. So I would say check it out, but be prepared for some disappointment."
3,This movie is okay...,"This movie is okay, I like it. It has too much corniness, weirdness and action scenes that are good, but kind of slim. Some other issues with this movie would be its short length and it has some bad writing within it. Despite these issues, this movie is very satisfying overall; It just would've been a lot better if its issues weren't present; they need to be fixed. 7.5/10"
2,Terrible - worst JL in decades. Lousy voice-over.,"I really wanted to like this edition to the JL universe. I just could not do it. The opening titles were the best part of the series. Since it's another earth, all the inhabitants organs are on opposite sides. But they are still right handed. Hmmmm.Idiotic plot holes. Why do the ""evil"" JL'ers have to sound like Godfather wanna-bees? Why is the mafia superman incredibly stupid? Why do nukes frighten them? The list can go on for pages.The voice-overs were just as bad. This is not what Superman and Bats are supposed to sound like. Half the voices sounded like an agent from ""The Matrix."" No inflection, no emotion - poorly read. Were the sneers permanently painted on the evil JL'ers faces?Mark Harmon as superman? Awful. Don't quit NCIS.Chris Noth as Lex? Pathetic. He should stick to cop shows. Some of the worst monotone voice-over.William Baldwin as batman? Not even close. Does he even have a current job?Skip it."
4,I love comic cartoons,"look, i love comic cartoons. that's my bottom line. As such, i was entertained...and it was unique to see Lex Luthor in a hero's character...If you like superhero comics and are not a hard core ""analyze the s*** out of every move DC or Marvel makes"" then you'll want to watch this for pretty much the same reasons I wanted to: entertainment, seeing comic heroes come to life, and interesting new twists. Aloha."
4,Awesome>>>>>>>>,"As other titles from this series, the action and the caracters are amaizing and the whole family enjoy, we still fans to Superman, Batman and other superheroes, thanks."
4,Where was the commentary,"I liked the movie but what I'm not getting why there really needed to be two discs? I mean one disc had a deeper look into the DCU that New Frontier had kinda explored then there was a JL episode, which was cool to see how the show did touch on the two earth theme. What I missed and was looking forward to was the commentary part. Where was that at and why was it not here? I never bought the two disc stuff but when I bought Public Enemies and there wasn't a commentary part on the single disc I figured maybe I need to start buying the two disc sets. The movie in itself is great, I liked it I watched it three times in row. I am starting to wish the movies were longer since they are now having way better scripts and stories in general. Again my only complaint is the lack of a commentary would have been nice to the behind the scenes, I'm a geek like that."
2,Previous Reviewer has the Wrong CD!,"The previous reviewer is thinking about the CD named ""Facing Future"" by the late Israel Kamakawiwo`ole which is nothing like John Keawe's work. It is Israel Kamakawiwo`ole's recording that is being used by the dot com commercials and as the theme to the ""Young Americans"". John Keawe is a classical guitarist with a similar style to John Williams. Mana`Olana is an good CD, but don't buy it thinking that it has the same haunting and hypnotic style of Kamakawiwo`ole."
1,I don't like it at all.,"I feel very disappointed and upset to spend more than thirty dollars on purchasing this one hour DVD cuz it's not the Street Jazz style at all. The dance style showed in the DVE is very old fashion and without any sexy element. Street Jazz, also called sexy Jazz or Power Jazz, is especially for girls to dance in night club or some vibrant stages to show charm and activate the dance atmosphere. Street Jazz should involve body wave and hip roll and other actions which require highly body flexibility. However, in this DVD, the dance is not in the category of Stree Jazz though it is kind of Street Dance. Now I am gonna sell it out as it can't be returned..."
5,Best Frosch,"This is my favorite opera, and I have heard most of the recordings. This one is the best by far. Not only are the singers wonderful, as the other reviews say, but their diction is exceptionally clear, allowing the drama and interaction to come through perfectly. The fact that it is not complete bothers me a little, but the cuts are nowhere near as bad as on Boehm's live Vienna recording on DG (i.e. the Dyer's wife parts that he always cut in live performance are mostly here, although he does cut that solo for the nurse in Act 3, which is very good--anyway, I think he cut the dyer's wife's stuff in live performance because the role was so taxing, not because he really thought it should be cut...so it's all here in this one). Christel Goltz's Dyer's wife is beautifully vivid here, so it is lucky that those cuts were not made. Rysanek is her usual amazing self. This recording is worth hundreds of stars...it's in a league of its own."
3,For True Fans,"Like alot of bands, the live stuff just doesn't do justice to the great musical genius that comes out of the studio. Such is the case with this release, coupled with the fact that the recording quality is relatively poor. The DVD has some interesting pieces, as well. All in all, this is a great capstone piece for a great band, but unless you're a true diehard that has a desire to support the band one last time, I'd stick to the studio stuff."
2,i tried.,"because of my love for FSF, i tried to like jon bunch. i really did. i even got the hide nothing cd and tried to like that too. but this cd showcases how crappy his voice is live. please stay in the studio where it is decent at best. also, it disappoints me that all the live songs are done by bunch, as he does absolutely no justice to the songs written by carraba and gleason.but although this singer doesn't compare to the previous 2, i give this cd a 2 not a 1 for what seems like an energetic live performance, judging by the crowd reaction on the live tracks. the band can still rock out, and they still hold their weight as excellent and creative musicians.don't buy this cd unless you absolutely love the band. if you really want to get a good feel for this band, stick to the pre-jon bunch era. i definitely recommend how to start a fire. that cd will blow your mind."
3,not bad,a must for any fsf fan. i'd give it a higher rating if jon were chris or jason. i like him and all but he doesnt handle the old songs well enough. the unreleased tracks are the real reason i bought it.
2,region specific and not very insightful,"I like the concept, and his maxims in the opening pages are very good. The author does a bad job at delivery though, often talking about examples in buying beachfront California party. While he made great investments at a great time 50 years ago, I don't have $2M+ to go buy a condo on the beach in California. He sort of uses best case scenario examples that aren't applicable to most investors' markets. This is one of those books the has several good ideas padded with pages and pages of fluff. Would make a great 10-15 page special report, but as far as a book is concerned, nothing great."
2,Buy and Hold --- Not worth it unless you live in California!,"This book is geared mainly towards real estate in southern California and has very little useful information about investing in cities anywhere else. Almost all of his examples are about how the author invested in one beachfront community in CA. I live in Atlanta, GA and the real estate market is totally different here, therefore, I got very little useful advice from this book. This author recommends buying apartments/condos and holding on to them at least 30 years. This probably is a very good book for people who live in California, otherwise, I'd recommend reading other books."
2,Good recount of what worked 40+ years ago!,"I have been a real estate investor for over 15 years and have not read a book on real estate investing in awhile. I read Schumacher's book and did not learn anything new. He is very thorough and covers a lot of ground, however, it is easy to understand his success, since almost all of his examples are over forty years old and he bought beach front properties to boot. Not much there for an investor who is just starting out or can no longer pick up beach front properties at 1960's prices."
2,Who is the Reader,"This book has some GENERAL good tips on what to look for when purchasing real estate - In a sense, it repeates the same adage over and over again: Location, Location, Location. This if fine BUT the problem is a lack of focus. Who is the reader. The author introduces baloon mortgage without explanation as if the reader is an expert; Yet he repeates the theme of location as if the reader is new on the block. The details assume a wonderfull world of sellers who give properties for a dollar and accept no down payments. As a small inverstor, this book is not much use for me."
4,"Cool System, good sound","Powerful sound from a small system. Not supercompact, but fits on my desk with no problems. The CD ripping feature is nice, but some newer CDs are copyrighted and it won't rip them (Window's Media Player will rip to WMA and you can put that on the flash drive). I personally could have done without the cassette deck, who still uses those things? All in all, worth it for the sound and the flash drive functionalities."
4,Philips MCM760 review,"Unit sounds very good! Ribbon tweeters add very nice airy sound to the highs without sounding pinched. Stereo arrived with a few blemishes, most likely from subpar packaging."
4,Lilting aroma will linger beyond sound's 'recede' !,"Can one get enough of 'pleasant?! Out of the evocative collaborative instrumental sensitiviesof Frank Morgan and his compatriots , the timeless affectionate and poignant sentiments,..what onewould want to say, the lyrics one needs to hear, refreshingly surface. Theirs is the capacity totweak our ""mundane"", and defuse our ""stressed"" saunter. And, ""listen-up"" newcomers:..""Delight de-rived is an endearing legacy of the golden recipe dishes ""to die for""!"
2,Bwah.....Urgh...Belch,"Ok its MTV so you can't expect any better. Its got tracks by Meshuggah and Arch Enemy and a couple of other bands, and might be a good primer for budding metalheads(maybe). However, most of the tracks are available as free legal downloads off the label websites(such as centurymedia.com for ArchEnemy) and the album is edited, which really is awful since metal isn't really a kiddies genre. Anyway I'll just mention some other metal bands that are decent in the hope that you'll start listening to some more decent music;Nevermore, Amorphis(mp3.com has 13 tracks by them for download, so's you get a good preview), Carcass, Pineapple Thief, Opeth Anathema, Katatonia, Novembre, Sentenced, Porcupine Tree, ....These are of course the more accessible bands."
1,Headbang? ...To this?,"The music compiled onto this cd is all the popular trendy music that MTV is famous for. It is for all those kids who hang out at the mall waiting for the next cool looking band shirt to come out of Hot Topic (or whatever cool metal/punk/screamo/grind stores you have). It's funny because most of the kids who buy this cd will think they are hardcore. The music on the cd is second class metal and hardly worth listening to, save maybe a couple songs. Hell, I wouldn't even download it for free. IMO ... don't support MTV for all they is ruin the genre, metal should be underground, not for the masses."
2,"Poor Comercial Sell-out ""Metal""","This CD might be heavy, but I don't recomend it to the listeners of the TRUE METAL. Well, anywhay, what else would you expect from Headbanger's Ball. They are using the same formula like they did back in the 80s'. It means you have to go through a torture of seeing crap like Mudvayne and Deftones in order to see some trully good stuff, like Arch Enemy, and Cradle of Filth.I wish Headbanger's Ball would never come back. With promoting such bands such as Marylin manson and Slipknot, they are giving a bad name and stereotype to other ignorant people about METAL.So, in conclusion, if you into so called nu-metal, this CD would be good in your collection.But if you're into a REAL METAL, and respect the bands such as IN FLAMES, CHILDREN OF BODOM, ARCH ENEMY, GODGORY, (older stuff) SENTENCED, this CD will be nothing, but a joke for you."
3,Edited Metal Music???,Well this 2 Cd set is not the greatest. There are many good songs but the songs are EDITED. Listening to edited metal music really sucks. Editing music ruins good songs. Why didnt MTV make these CDs with unedited tracks. Well for this reason MTV sucks! They ruined good music by editing it. Overall 2 good cds to listen to with your Grandparents!!!!!!!
4,well duh,"Well, for those of us that are hardcore rock fans, we keep up on all the hardcore rock news. There was an MTV special on a little while ago, when this cd was first released, and they even said that the first CD was more well known bands, and the second was some underground bands. They didn't mix it on PURPOSE, HELLO. Great cd."
2,"Bad Choices, Bad Editing, Bad CD...BAD MTV!","If you've read any other reviews on this site, I'm sure you know of the editing this CD contains, so I won't complain about that. I guess MTV just wanted to edit it so all the 8 year old kids that watch Headbanger's Ball won't be offended...if any...But besides that, I have to complain about the choices. OK, Mudvayne, GOOD BAND, bad choice. ""World So Cold"" is a great, beautiful song, and that's the problem...does a beautiful, melodic song belong on an album called ""Headbanger's Ball""? Probably not. But here it is, picked over the AMAZINGLY heavier ""Not Falling"" which was played probably twice as much on the same show. Hey, that's MTV for ya."
4,my view...,"From the mainstreamers whining ""Ooh, the 2nd disc has growling on it! death metal vocals suck! Lacuna Coil is too heavy for me and they rip-off Evanescence anyway!"" to the elitist metalheads saying ""All the bands here are too poppy, In Flames sold out, Cradle of Filth sold out, etc. etc."", it all makes me very angry. I think it represents both sides of metal greatly.However, I feel the next HBB album will be 1000x better than this."
4,"good mix, but editing !?","This cd has the best mix of songs i have ever seen. the only thing that sux is they have no korn (but i have every korn cd anyway so whatever). the first cd has well known bands like godsmack, cold, staind, rob zombie, etc. the second cd has not-so-well known bands like arch enemy and cradle of filth. many people call the second cd ""underground"" but none of the bands are really underground, they're just not that popular. has alot of singles from bands that have crappy cd's otherwise, like staind and cold, so if u want to save money, buy this cd. $15 dollars for 40 tracks is amazing. the only thing that hurt this cd is the editing. i know it's mtv but even they dont mess cd's up this much. it just takes away the feel to the cd hearing songs bleeped out. Besides that though, great cd. for beginning metal-heads, get this cd (it will introduce u) but for someone who has everything like me, i wouldn't really recommend it."
3,great tracks. bad editing,"it has a great selection of tracks, but it is edited. The editing is obnoxious, and can ruin a great song like ""world so cold"" by mudvayne. I was quite angry when i realized it was edited, but what would you expect from MTV?"
2,Loggy Bayou climbing aid,The Loggy Bayou stands are fantastic but this climbing aid is poorly engineered. Must operate with 2 hands and that is hard to do while using the tree stand. Connection points are very noisy while climbing and setting up/taking down and carrying. Would highly recommend the stand but would not at all recommend the climbing aid
3,Not up to their awesome earlier stuff,"I don't know what's happening to Cathedral. Their recent output, while decent, just pales in comparison to their earlier classics. ""Forest of Equilibrium"" is a bona fide doom classic, and ""The Ethereal Mirror"" and ""Carnival Bizarre"" were more polished but lost none of the heaviness. After that, it seems to have gone downhill; while there are good moments, overall something is missing and the heaviness is diluted. They seem to want to sound more like Monster Magnet. Maybe that's what Cathedral wants. But as the flagship doom metal outfit, Cathedral owes us quality product. Let us hope they don't turn into another Metallicrap. As for now, stick with ""Ethereal Mirror"" if you want to hear them at top form."
2,"Same old, same old","This album left me stone cold, Cathedral have lost all their credibilty and turned into just another stoner rock/doom-band with nothing to separate them from the mass of Kyuss/Monster Magnet-wannabees out there.Perhaps the biggest dissapointment for me was the lyrics, they're so conventional, and this from the band that gave us ""The Voyage of the Homeless Sapien"", ""Night of the Seagulls"" and ""Purple Wonderland"" to name but a few.While on this album Lee Dorrian is droning on about revolution and freedom for the people, politicians controlling us through television etc etc, like a thousand other hippie bands have regurgiated a thousand times.Sorry, I didn't like it."
5,Getting To Know Me Then Us,"Gentlemen, Start Her Engine - And Keep It Running, although targeted to a male audience, is conversely a tremendous opportunity for us women to think, feel and grow - to get under our skin and uncover our likes, dislikes, needs and styles - then - what if we took the initiative and invited our Love into our lives by sharing those discoveries?I loved Steven's simple, thorough and fun! approach to getting to know me ... Found out that I am a Diesel Engine Woman (and proud of it!). His ""Romantic History List"" was an excellent tool to recall the precious past and keep up with the present. I was surprised with what I listed on the My Favorites, Not My Favorites, Pet Peeves and Wishes lists ... carried this book with me for weeks (why rush?) into coffee shops and atmospheres wherever my Love and I could be comfortable and communicate. The intimacy these exercises created is priceless. Thank you Steven.Viveca A. StoneRadio Talk Show HostThe Get Ready For Love Show"
1,it's funny how...,"... 19 of the 20 5-star reviews for this ""book"" were all written by some individuals (or better ""the same individual"") who never wrote any other reviews. It's a miracle to me how Amazon can provide a platform for such shamefull scamming. On second thought, no, it's probably not all that surprising."
1,??????????????????????,"Not to criticize this latest edition to the Godzilla series (I wouldn't know what to review), but how can Amazon expect a customer to pre-order this dvd when there is absolutely no product detail other than the fact that there are 2 discs, the running time is 400 minutes, and it's being released in July? NOT A GOOD IDEA, AMAZON! ULTIMATE ERROR!"
1,Not a Legit Release,"Since Classic Media owns the rights to these particular Godzilla films, it is obvious that this is not a legitimate release. I'm surprised it even made it to Amazon.com.If you want inferior, public domain TV prints, that is probably what you're getting here. If you want DVD quality and legal versions of these films, get the Classic Media discs."
5,They've done another good job here...,"I've read pretty much all of Connors' trading books and was not disappointed with this last one. Building on his VIX research, he has developed a good suite of strategies to help pinpoint changes in S&P trend. I have found success with the Connors VIX Reversal I-V strategies and can't wait to use the CVR 6-11 strategies I just learned. His backtests show that the CVR is nearly 70% correct! For those of you unfamiliar with the VIX, it is basically a measure of fear in the market, more specifically, it ""reflects a market concensus estimate of future volatility based on at-the-money quotes of OEX options."" Basically, when you have a high relative VIX reading (high volatility) then you can expect an imminent sell-off. When you have a low relative VIX reading (low volatility) then you can expect a quiet rising market. Check it out. It's short but sweet."
5,the king of gangsta rap is back for the throne,"Ice Cube brings it hard on this album and let's these wannabe gangstas coming up know that he's the father of this gangsta s*** and he can't be f'd with, with songs like ""Why We Thugs"", ""Child Support"", ""Laugh Now, Cry Later"", ""Go To Church"", ""The N*** Trapp"", and ""Chrome Paint"", he puts out an album that not many rappers today could contest against, if you're a fan of quality hip-hop and not that pop rap garbage that gets played every five seconds on the radio then this album's for you"
4,pretty good cd,after listening to plenty of samples and many of the songs...i can say this cd is honestly pretty good. it's pretty much the same classic ice cube i like. he definitely comes real in this cd. and tells it like it is. go to church is a great song. not perfect but close!
2,Great Odin's Raven!!!!,"Well, Ice sure had to wait a long time to put out this disc. I'm sure all those family movies and clothing ads were keeping him very very busy. Busy, that is, becoming the kind of person that he railed against on the classic ""Amerikkka's Most Wanted"" album. What's the matter, Cube? Too much money and you have nothing to complain about? Were you just mad at being poor? Or did ""they"" pay you so much you felt content enough to shut up?But onto 2006...Fearing that he was losing his loyal audience of white NWA fans, Ice Cube returned with ""Laugh Now..."" an epic work of lackluster proportions indeed. Although advance hype for the album had followers believing that this cd would be a return to form, instead it is a party album in the vein of his last two albums, bolstered only by a few political tracks. This album is a testament to the idea that rap is a young man's game, and Ice Cube has totally melted."
1,Far From Favorite,"With the exception of beats, this project is a total flop. In Cube's hay day, when being driven by foes, political views and social consciousness out played pollaseeds spittin and hood snitchin, Cube masterfully gave us enough to ride around all weekend with that one favorite Ice Cube CD on repeat."
1,This Album Stinks,"I cant believe Cube put slop like this out. If you liked Death Cert, Predator, or Lethal Injection, RUN FROM THIS CD!!!! This album is pretty much a continuation of the nonsense on War and Peace, but not even as good! He can still rap a little, but the beats are so lame, its a crime. I am just dumbfounded how and why Cube put out this album. What a shame."
2,the Ice Melted,"back in the day Ice Cube was something else. Jerri Curl Era Ice cube was the baddest cat on the mic.but after going Hollywood&turning that scene out his music ain't been the same. after 95 Cube was never quite the same. this Album is ok,but it is about 7-8 years too late at trying to up-date his sound.Lil Jon&Scott Storch just bring dime a Dozen production. subject matter is hit&miss as well. Cube has long ago secured his place in Rap History long ago,but musically dude ain't brought it fully in years.i respect his all around game as a Artist,but Musically he is dropping tracks that compared to his hey day are 2nd&3rd rate tracks."
2,"Cry now,do movies later....","The end of an era has arrived for one of the best rappers of all-time.When you get 20 songs on a cd and only 3 or 4 are worth listening to it's pretty sad. The song with WC is the worst ever...and I was looking so forward to that track.And what about all the comic filler with Day-day? What's the point?Cube needs to get back with Sir Jinx,Crazy Toons or how about that NWA reunion album with Ren and Dre? I should have listened to former Lenchmob member Jdee when he told me that the man was all washed up...Bro O'Shea just focus on the movies from now on.I should have saved my nine bucks and brought some gas instead of this lackluster effort.Buy at your own risk."
5,the king of gangsta rap is back,I think this cd is bangin. I think he made a comeback. for y'all haters out what he is sayin on this record is the truth. if the brothers isn't listening to what he is saying something is wrong with you.
5,Ice Cube Is Back,"Ive been waiting a while to get my hands on this album, and sure enough i was certainly NOT disapointed! every track on the album is there for a reason, there is not one track you could defie as weak! Just buy it! a album for true Hip Hop fans!"
3,Not The Same Cube.....Maybe More Mature Ice Cube,"This album was not at all what one would expect from Cube. Ice Cube is displaying his age and maturirty here and reminding the people that he is a legend and an established artist. However he fails to caputure that hunger and gritty raw attitude he had in earlier years. I noticed alot of southern influences in this album. The south at this time is the dominant force in hip hop and is making an impact everywhere. The east coast and west coast artist's are being impacted by the southern sound so much so that they have began to mimick it to a large degree. Ice Cube does alot of lecturing throughout his cd such as in songs the child support in which he asks why rappers with millions of dollars are still mad and shooting guns at the grammys. He makes good points throughout his new album, however over all its not the same Cube. Maybe for some this is a nice change but for others this will be a disapointment. I did enjoy it for the most part."
4,Maybe not his best. But still one solid album,"I read some of these reviews. Some of cube fans need to realize that Cube is just growing with the times. But I wouldn't rule him out in the future working with Sir Jinx or Pooh again. But his new album is still very listenable from beginning to end. The only problem i had was some of the lil jon songs on the album, that I kind of find them a lil skippable. But I was very satisfy of how the way ""laugh now, cry later"" turn out. Ice cube has put it down for years. Matter in fact he goes to the days of wayy back. He's been rapping since '85 with CIA. He's been in the game just has long as LL. And Cube don't need to make campy love songs, and take his shirt off to sell records. Cube will always keep it raw and hardcore! Sorry Licker lips Lame J. you never will be on Ice's rapping or acting level"
2,Cube's gettin soft,"this CD was not what I was expecting, it did'nt seem like Cube at all maybe it's all the money that has made this guy so soft now. I guess the CD is okay at best though."
3,It's alright!!!!!!!!,"Ice you are the man, but this album doest truly represent you, better luck next time dog."
3,Laugh Now and Cry Later...... Cube you shoud of done it now.,"Where the hell is Sir Jinx and DJ Pooh?, Cube could of done way better then this."
3,Solid Effort By An O.G,"From what Ive heard off this disc,Id say its a solid effort for Cube.""Child Support"" is as raw as Ive heard Cube in a while.""Why We Thugs"" and ""Smoke Some Weed"" are solid tracks as well.Yes there are some weak moments on this disc but for a rapper who has been in the game as long as Cube,he can still spit rhymes with the best of them.A final note,Jenny ""The New Yorker"" needs to quote Billboards reviewer next time she jacks his words for her review."
5,The Legend Is Back,"After a long long break, 6 years I think, Cube is back with this solid album. This along with Dmx new one were my favorite albums to come out this year. While this is not as good as War, Death Certificate or Amerikas Most, its better than listening to all the garbage on the radio today, which Cube addresses on Child Support. Of course the single Why We Thugs is bangin, Smoke Some Weed grew on me, and Mike Epps will make you laugh on Dimes and Nicks. The N**ga trap has a funny line about flava flav, and another good one is Laugh Now Cry Later. Get this if you aint got it."
4,Cube Still the Coldest,"Cube delivers his infamous rhyming style with hardcore westcoast beats appropriate for the veteran iconic rapper. With this album you get a little bit of everything. If you grew up lovin' Cube, you'll definitely appreciate that you can vibe to this album all grown up."
2,Sorry,"Although not bad, not to good either. Ice cubes just a little to old school for my taste, but he does have a few moddern day songs that arent to bad which is why I gave this cd a 2 star rating.Feel free to listen and or download this album"
5,His First Album In Six Years,"Laugh Now, Cry Later is Ice Cubes first album in six years and he's still got it. The best songs are Smoke Some Weed, Go To Church, and You Gotta Lotta That."
5,Ice is back,"""Ain't no other kings in this rap thingthey siblingsnuthin but my chil'renone shot they disappearin'""ENOUGH SAID"
3,"Laugh Now, Cry Later is a good album.","Laugh Now, Cry Later ***1/2 StarsLaugh Now, Cry Later is a very decent comeback from Ice Cube who did the great Amerikkaz's Most Wanted, although some songs are not as good as it was on that album, but the beats are beautifully done and ice cube who's always good here, is still good here, Why we thugs is still a good song and his apperance with mike epps on the video is nice, and WC is good (but where's mack 10 where we need him?)Although this is a very solid album.Thumbs Up."
3,Just another Dora movie,Noting too advanced for this movie. My daughter and even son love the Dora family and this was no better. It held their attention and they were both engaged in it.
5,I Wish I had Bought It,"My twins are 4 and they've been wanting less Dora and more Wonder Pets and Blue's Clues. However, I picked a Dora movie for them that night--Dora's Rescue in Mermaid Kingdom. They loved it soooooo much!! They keep asking to see it again, weeks later. The music was less annoying than in most of the regular Dora Episodes. I wish I had bought this movie instead of just renting it."
4,granddaughters loved it,Gave it a four . Was at my daughters anddecided to rent this for my granddaughter they loved it and the quality of the movie was great on my kindle.
3,The usual,"This is more of the same - which is what the girls love. When they're happy, I'm happy! BTW, how DOES she turn into a mermaid?"
4,it works for the lumix tz5,I purchased this bag mainly to carry the panasonic lumix tZ5 safely when I don't have any larger cameras on me. The lumix fits snug and that is a good thing. This bag also has space for my extra batteries. It works great for what it is for. If you have a smaller point and shoot than the lumix I would recomend also getting a smaller bag. This bag is just a bit too big to fit into anyones pocket.
4,Good for the price,I used these for a bathroom I put in the basement. They were alot cheaper then anything I could find locally and they are doing the job. Not the best quality in the world but they work well.
4,Very Good,The products came immediately via mail and the quality is very good.I am very happy with my purchase.
3,Acceptable,The price of this set was commensurate with the quality. It was acceptable for a second bathroom. The color was right on but it is very light weight. I would not recommend for a bathroom that gets heavy use.
4,B0000CERNY/ref=aw_cr_item_title,"I've always liked Vanessa William's voice. I'm also a sucker for ""best of collections.""I adore the ballads she sings, but can't stand it when she sings hip hop, which of course is her perogitive. I'm just getting old, while artists don't want to be labled in one genre. When she sings pop songs, everythimg is so over synthesized, the drums, background singers, guitar, even Vanessa's voice is over done."
5,World Music at its inception,"Fantastic! One of the most awe inspiring recordings ever made. Not for the ordinary music listener, but for the officinado, the true lover of music from around the world."
4,Night Dance,"If you like Acoustic Alchemy or the Rippingtons,this is much in the same vein. Telarc has certainley missed the boat by not promoting these artists. All tracks on this album are a joy to listen to. While not as mesmerizing as Acoustic Alchemy - La Vienta has served notice that they deserve recognition in this area. I could go on and on with superlatives. But I wont - do yourself a favor add this to your jazz colletion - its that good."
1,Arrived broken in two peices; shipper packaging very poor.,"I ordered this telescoping rod for my living room but never got to use it as it arrived in two peices. The rod was simply packaged in one flimsy sandwich-style covering of cardboard and clearly had something heavy leaned against it. Amazon was very nice, though, and did issue a credit, although they did require that I return it which I thought was a little silly.Regardless, I would say this could very well be a useful item it you can get it to your house in one peice."
2,flash for dummy!,"u cannot finish this on 24 hours. I have Flash background but I finished ""chapter 5"" in 13 hours, which was supposed to finish in 5 hours. Sooooooo many text and difficult for ESL students. Not step by step and not too many graphic. No CD or resource files to do tutorials."
5,Very good book,"This is my first review of any book. I felt strongly enough about this book to write up a quick review.I'm a software developer by trade, not really a web developer (so far). I've started down the Flash road a couple of times and have never really done anything with it. Until now. My customer had a need for a flash movie clip so I bought Phillip's book after reading the reviews and they are right on.I does take a bit more than 24 hours and I'm only on hour 15, but I'm comfortable enough to get done what I need to. This is a great book to get the basics down as well as learn a few of the millions of tricks you can do with Flash. Very well structured - logical and clear, at least to me.Flash is a very complex program and complex to navigate if you've never seen it before. Phillip does an outstanding job all the way around.Also, I had a question after publishing my moving and Phillip returned the email within 30 minutes. Awesome!Needless to say, I highly recommend this book."
4,A great introduction to Flash 8,"I borrowed this book from the library but just popped on Amazon to purchase it. The criticism that this book tends to be repetitive is true. However, as a newbie on Flash (except running through some of the included tutorials that didn't necessarily give all the short-cuts, reasoning, etc...that I found in this book), I find the repetition helpful. In so many computer training books they throw the information out at you once and then, when you come across it again chapters later, you only vaguely remember it. I prefer not to waste my time looking things up. Anyway, I think Phillip Kerman must have extensive actual classwork time with real live students to have been able to come up with such a WORKING manual. I have on my desk about 10 different manuals for various programs that I borrowed from the library but this is the ONLY one that I really want to purchase because it has so much information in it (that I want to mark and tag and write in my own copy!!)."
5,Excellent step-by-step overview,Flash is a complex program with innumerable functions. Phillip Kerman breaks the program down into bite-size chunks and leads you through each one step by step. His explanations are concise and easy to understand and always followed immediately by practical exercises so that right from the outset you get your hands dirty creating things using the program. The absolute beginner will have a solid overview of the basic functions of Flash by the end of the book and be able to begin experimenting with a project. The book's well-organized structure and detailed index would also make it ideal as a reference tool for those who already have some knowledge of the program.
5,Solid!,This is one of the more solid albums of any kind I have purchased. I believe it's now considered a bluegrass classic. Check it out!
5,If I could only have one CD...,"I can't believe it took me 5 years to find this CD. An eclectic collection of songs and incredible artists. The Memphis Horns are amazing and the talent they invited to this session is a perfect mix. Definitely a must have for the R&B, soul, blues lover."
5,MEMPHIS HORNS,This is an awesome compilation of artists with the Memphis Horns. All I can say is 'MORE'. A treasure!!
5,rocks,I first heard this band backing Robert Cray and have loved them ever since. Etta James rocks the house.
1,Scam?,"I was looking for Bay City Rollers' first album, but this is not it. I'm still not sure just what I've downloaded here, or who the band really is.Freaky. Not recommended."
1,Be Careful !!,Be Careful !!The explanation of this Blu-ray disc is mistake.Language is only English not Japanese and no subtitle (Japanese and English) !!
5,"Beautiful Picture, Good Sound, Excellent Deal","This television has a beaufiful picuture. I recently bought and then sold a newer, larger television, because the picture quality was much better on this smaller set. (perceived picture quality always decreases as size increases, but the quality delta of the new set was just too great).Sound quality is good, not great, but it is a small set.I watch dvd's a lot and this has component video in - which is a must have in my opinion.Also, remote control is smaller and easier to use than other models."
3,Bulky but good,"This ""portable"" TV has Sony's usual good quality picture but is heavy and bulky. If only it were available in a flat-screen version! It takes too much space on our kitchen counter and it is bigger and bulkier that the Sony TV we replaced, but the old version is no longer available."
2,An Easy Read That is Loaded with Facts,"Yabuki and Harner both give a general and broad view of China's economic transformation with the reforms of Deng Xiaoping in 1978. However, the two rely heavily on government statistics and the book can become dense with the charts, plots and tables. This edition is radically revised from the first edtion with Harner adding statistics and relevant material since the first edition. A nice reader about China for the economically and numerically-minded, but if this is your first book about China today, I would reccommend Gasster's ""China's struggle to modernize"" or Spence's ""The search for modern China"" or Schell and Shambaugh's recent ""China Reader"" as better alternatives."
3,good not great,"The author really is quite a good writer. My only problem with this book is that is drags in the middle becoming a little too long until finally reaching the climaxic ending, which is very good."
2,Ghosts in the Prose,"I was disappointed in this book. The descripton on the jacket holds a lot of promise, but the story falls short of the mark. I also had problems with modern slang being injected into the story. Did someone in medieval times really say ""dangit""?? Or get ""your head outta your ass!"" (was this castle in New Jersey?) Another time one of the women is thinking about something and she tells herself, ""don't even go there!"" It was difficult to figure out when this book really took place or is that part of the fantasy?I felt like it was on the edge of being really good, but kept missing somehow."
1,Oops,"This book was recommended to me. I opened it eagerly on the day I bought it.On the first page of this first published novel, in the Acknowledgments, I read:""I'd also like to thank my agent, William Reiss, for taking a chance on Dubric and I.""On I?Confidence in the author shattered. Book returned to pile of the Great Unread to wait a more humble turn."
4,Excellent Debut Work,"On the suggestion of a friend I picked up this book and found myself enthralled from cover to cover. While warned that there were hints strewn though out as to the identity of the killer I was clueless until the very end.Interesting marriage of fantasy and forensics, well developed characters and I've now got a thirst for the author's upcoming novel as well.Good work Tamara Siler Jones!"
5,Peruvian fan # 1,I am really fanatic of Gianmarco He is really good as composer-author of those beautiful lyrics. I love you Gianmarco from Manhattan NY PillY.
5,Gianmarco is wonderful,"A peruvian idol. he has 5 music productions: Historias part 1, entre la arena y la luna, al quinto dia, señora cuenteme(tipical peruvian songs) and this wonderful cd called A tiempo. In this Cd gianmarco used a very high voice that makes his songs improved but with the same taste than before. I recomend it to everybody who wants to know this artist. if you like it(no doubt at all) you should get the rest of his produccions. good luck gianmarco, I'm happy you are here in U.S.A."
4,Calm relaxing and even fun.,"The music on this is moving, calm, relaxing and has some energy to it and it all comes together very well. I recommend the mp3 album. I think you will enjoy this if you like music that is good for background music and lends itself to the situation wonderfully."
4,Gouge Jig Creeping!!!,Once setup the jig does what it is suppose to do. The only problem is that when grinding it wants to constantly creep forward. You have to always exert a constant pressure to the rear to compensate for this. Jet needs to do something to prevent it from going forward.
3,Gouge Jig,I have tried to use this jig. I have watched the video 3 times and haven't got it right yet. I need the jig so I will keep trying. Part of the difficulty is the original cut on the gouge is obviously wrong.
4,Returned item,This is easy to use with the Jet Sharpener but you need to watch the video that comes with the sharpener for easy to understand explanation of its use with the machine. You can try U-tube also they have a deom on there if you dont have the video that Jet puts out.....
3,Siris Shower Cap X-Large Satin Lined Vinyl,"The shower cap is large enough, and the satin lining is also nice. But the elastic on the cap began to fray immediately upon use. I like the shower cap, but I don't expect that it will last very long."
2,Only for the hard-core or for historical research,"I love juju music, and I love old recordings from the 30s and 40s (lots of old Hawaiian, Bluegrass, and early Singing Cowboy discs in my collection). I usually don't mind the LP noise because that's part of the package. In this case, however, I was very disappointed--angry, really--at the poor job of remastering the vinyl or orignial tapes to CD. For the first few tracks, I could barely hear the music above the clicks and hisses. It was only at about the two-thirds mark through the CD that the music was louder than the noise. Furthermore, I found that less than half of the music sounded even remotely like juju music--probably about a third. I really doubt that the earliest, middle-eastern sounding tracks(from what I could tell through the noise) had any role in the creation and evolution of juju. A guide to World Music that I read called this disc ""essential."" I call it a ripoff."
4,Good Stuff,"If you are looking for a fun, quirky, feel-good, indie comedy then Little Big Top is right up your alley. You'll recognize a few of the bigger actors, including the dude from Greek, as well as the guy from Office Space, and finally Sid Haig. Haig usually does the horror thing, but he really pulls the clown gig off in this one, becoming a buffoon and a funny grump all in the same role."
5,Richly Crafted,"The laughs and lessons 'Little Big Top' seeks to impart do not hit you in the face, but rather percolate just below a richly crafted and deliberate surface. As the story proceeds, they pop their heads up for moments at a time, until by the end of the movie, you cannot help but laugh at, with, and learn from, lead clown Seymour Smiles and his beer-laden, snow-cone-sipping journey of self-discovery. A grade-A thinking man's film you will want to watch over and over again. Check it out!"
5,Very original - nothing quite like it!,Little Big Top is an original indedpendent film - the kind you can't see at the multiplexes. The subtlety and character development is astounding and it's also a lot of fun. You need to check this movie out!
4,Crazy Circus Clown!,"I am normally terrified of clowns, but this movie was awesome! That town is too good to be true!"
4,"Entertaining, capitvating and funny","I thoroughly enjoyed this movie! From start to finish it had my attention. Characters were deep and compelling, ones you root for and yell at, not flat and one-dimensional like so many mainstream flicks now-a-days. Recommend!"
4,"If ""Bad Santa"" had a bigger heart. And Santa was a clown. And that kid wasn't in it...","This flick had a big ol' heart. Good mix of dramedy and comma. Shows small towns with an honest, but not pretentious or condescending, eye. Check it out and have a laugh with Sid Haig as a clown on his luck... um... wow, that horrible pun totally derailed me. But see it."
3,Peru Sucks,"The reason Peru, Indiana has so many clowns is there are no JOBSPeru,Indiana has the Highest unemployment of any county in middleIndiana and has since the late 1980s.No-one works so were all CLOWNS"
4,Great fluid talented dancing w/pop & locks - too advanced for absolute beginners,"I like to just add this isn't for the beginner who's into dancing for fun once in a while or who takes while to learn.Jermaine has GREAT talent & so do the 2 back up guys. The use of mirrors & the camera to the side/behind the Jermaine is GREAT, I wish all dance dvds did that. But there is mostly only counting. So if you have trouble learning, this may be too advanced for you. You should already have fluidity in your moves, etc. I am among the ones who have trouble keeping up & got frustrated, but it doesn't mean I think this product doesn't have a lot to offer.As another said, just look up this title on youtube & a great trailer can be found to see the awesome talent."
3,better music next time,This was a fun dance video. However it took me awhile to realize what it was missing......The music. The music was ok but did not make me want to dance.
5,"Practical, good - for price","A standard product, cotton, color holds (post laundry), avg. softness - like any other similar product. The material is NOT paper thin, but of good quality and most important the threads are sewn securely. Would buy again and recommend - yes."
4,Add to your collection.,"This figure is excellent to add to your Jeff Gordon collection or just any NASCAR collection. It is fully poseable and seems pretty durable. My only complaints about it are, first, it doesn't really resemble Jeff Gordon (it takes alot of imagination to be able to see the resemblance) and second, the rubber gloves that come with the figure are very hard to put on and take off. Otherwise this is a fun collectible to have. I have the Jimmie Johnson figure as well, and both go great together."
1,spark plug wire adventure,"I bought the spark plugs because it was a great price, but in my 84 325e bmw the the wires had a straight plug in to the distributor cap. This setup has a 45 degree elbow to go into the distibutorcap. with the radiator right there, i had some minor issues. i would not reccomend it for a model like mine."
5,Plan to eat when you travel? This book is a must!,"As fun to read as it is accurate, packable and irreplaceable, The Hungry Traveler for Mexico is the right book for anyone who enjoys eatings as much as traveling. The book is as much an appetizer for travel as for dining; I wasn't sure whether I was salivating more over the descriptions of the food or the thought of being in a place where I could eat such things. Forget your Spanish-English dictionary (it doesn't have important food terms anyway), and tuck this delicious little culinary guide into your pocket. The pronunciation guide is extensive and exact, and Marita Adair not only knows food, she knows Mexico and she knows travelers. It's as if you've found a good friend to eat out with--she won't lead you astray. You'll eat well using this book, you'll learn the nuances of dining in Mexico, and you'll find the way to the heart of the country."
5,Great book for girls,"My daughter and I really enjoy these books. With so many cheap and badly written children's book out there, we really appreciate the quality of these series. They are always printed on really nice paper and the illustrations are beautiful. Most important, though, the stories are appropriate for young girls and the characters provide good role models."
5,I want to read more,After reading this book I wanted to read more A.G. books. I have read some other A.G. books. I loved reading them.
5,Esta reconfra bueno me encanto es ermoso lo recomiendo,Algunas palabras dificiles peroestamuy bueno el libro meet samantha es re lindo ll recomiendo para personas de nueve para arriva
3,Amazing Samantha/Book Report/ Meet Samantha,"I read the book Meet Samantha. This book is interesting. This book is more of an adventure book of her life.In this story Samantha becomes friends with a girl from the orphanage. I learned some interesting facts. I learned that when you become something you can't pretend to be that anymore. Also I learned that if you are a good person you are going to become a good person. I would recommend this book for three reasons. First reason it tells you how Samantha worked just to become someone's friend. The second reason is when you start reading you just can't stop. Third, when you are reading this book I think you are going to like it. Meet Samantha is an exciting."
1,Tamale Recipe- Where Did It Come From???????????,"I'm reading through the 20 sample pages of the book. The first thing that pops up in my mind is, why do they call the Seguin family by their titles rather than their names. One gets the impression that the writers think the names are ""Don"" Seguin and ""Dona"" Seguin. Hey, there, Don, what's for dinner? I wonder if they realize this.Next, the tamale recipe. It calls for masa harina, so I am guessing it is an adaptation of an old recipe. Why then, do they just call for ""chili pods"" instead of giving a quantity or weight, and defining whether they mean ancho (which they probably do), pasilla, guajillo or a combination of the three.If my comments are valid, this indicates that there is some very sloppy journalism at work here."
2,Good but not great.,"Oscar is getting old and it is reflected in this CD. I bought my first Peterson album 35 years ago and I always thought he was the best at piano jazz. Over the years, you can hear him stumbling through his notes a bit and some of the magic is gone.Perlman, well I've seen him at Symphony Hall in Boston and I expected better of him, too. On this CD he sounds like any other fiddle player, nothing spectacular. I just don't think they make a good match.Cut #7, Nightime is great. Oscat wrote it and the arrangement is terrific. I heard it in the movie Indecent Prooposal.This one is for Oscar collectors but if it is your first, go with his earlier stuff.Regards, Peter Benoit"
1,It really is awful,"I bought this album thinking the usual -- two great artists -- masters of their instruments -- wonderful songs -- what could be more perfect? Unfortunately, this is one of the worst albums I have ever heard, a real collaboration from hell -- so bad that I cannot compare it to any other failed collaboration in music history. I agree that much of the blame lies with Perlman, who does not appear to understand the jazz idiom and showed up without jazz chops. Leave this one in the dustbin."
1,Pretty much a snorefest.,"Very disappointing.Much of the blame lies with Perlman. It's not merely that he's clueless about jazz style; the bigger problem is that his playing is small-scaled, tentative, and charmless. Menuhin, for example, wasn't much more idiomatic when playing with Grapelli, but at least he sounded as though he was enjoying himself. Perlman's torpor affects the rest of the band, too - they all sound as though they're phoning it in."
4,great gift,"my nephew loves this set. it was his 4th birthday present and he was very excited to get it. he already had other pieces, but the detail of this one with 'real' gold coins in the treasure chest made a big impression. good value with many pieces."
3,Someone's been breaking into the spirits....,"The late Joe Williams was a great vocalist. It's such a joy to hear him sing ANYTHING, even the kind of slick jazz-gospel funk contained herein, that I can recommend this without any guilty aftereffects. But the concept behind this project IS a little hard to take. We are told that this is ""real roots music""--African-American spirituals, to be exact--yet the track list includes originals by arranger Johnny Pate, plus the 1905 Charles Gabriel gospel masterpiece ""His Eye Is on The Sparrow,"" whose words were written by Civilla D. Martin, the Canadian-born wife of a Baptist minister. In fact, the booklet reveals that Word, Inc. owns the copyright for ""Sparrow."" So, what's up with the ""spiritual"" label? Is a strange sense of humor at work here? More likely, very little thought went into this. Buy ""Feel the Spirit"" for Williams' splendid singing. Note: This was recorded with Monster Cable (see page 7). Wow. You'd better get this one, then."
1,what a RIPP OFF - DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS COMPANY,It is OCT and I still have not recieve my Dragon shirt. Of course they offer no way of solving this. I will never do business with this company.Richard Amores
4,Pike Street Flannel sheets,"I bought these sheets to use on a soft side queen waterbed and they fit very nicely. The colors are very nice,and as pictured; the fabric seems sturdy and they washed very well, coming out of the dryer nice and fluffy. Sleeping in these sheets is warm and cozy and the flannel helps everything to ""stay put"" on the bed! [My husband moves a lot in his sleep, and regular cotton sheets slide all over the place with his movements and, by morning, the bed is a wreck -- not so with the flannel, which is a bonus for the bed maker each morning!]These sheets were a great value for the price."
3,Good price,I bought these bed sheets in the queen size and bought them because we love flannel sheets. The snowflake pattern is nice. I don't think they are going to hold up well and have only been washed 1 time so far. The bed sheets are pilling pretty good so they are already showing wear. I hope they last a few years so we will see. I bought them for only $9.99 and don't see prices like that very often for flannel bed sheets. These bed sheets made a nice Christmas gift that was affordable for us so I think they were worth the price.
5,winter theme sheet set,Love it! It holds up in the wash and keeps that soft feel to it. I would order more when they become available again (in the price range that I got them for).
4,Cozy,"These were a good value for the money, wash well and keep you comfy and cozy on these cool WA nights. I got them for the winter but it's June and it's in the high 40's at night - who knew flannel was the year round sheet for the northwest resident."
5,randy b,"this linnen set is very comfortable, looks very nice and feels good on the skin, im very happy i purchased this set"
1,A Bit of Brundage: The Illustration Art of Frances Brundage Sarah Steier,"This is a fantastic book! I use it for reference all the time, the pictures are so vivid and the paper is so nice to the touch."
3,This girl has got a voice and a half!,"First off, I feel kind of bad for giving this album only three stars..I gave it 3, instead of 5 because of my personal taste in musical style and lyrics. (Some of the songs were kind of tired like: ""How Do I Tell My Little Sister?""..and ""The Captain And The Lady"". They were a little too back-woods-country-potunk for me.) But other selections like ""His Love..,Talkin..,Find Your Baby Gone, and Boogie In The Middle"" are some of the best complex blues vocals that I have heard in a long time. This woman has one of the greatest strongest voices that I have ever had the pleasure of listening to. I'de say good management is the only thing that's keeping this songbird from the big time. This CD is definately worth buying!"
3,Missing Parts,"When I ordered these shocks I did so with two other shocks and two struts(different vehicles), so it made sense to do so based on the combined purchase price. As far as convenience, I would have been better off to buy these at a local parts store.Unfortunately these shocks didn't come with all the parts. Although the packaging was unopened, it was missing the rubber bushings for one of the shocks. Fortunately I was able to buy the additional parts from a local parts store rather than waiting any longer for the missing pieces to be delivered. Finally, I'm not sure were these shocks were stored or how they were handled, but they had a few dings and dents on them...as far as I can tell it hasn't affected the performance though."
2,Umm.,"I pretty sure there's only one good moment in this film, and it's with ""the guy from the bag."" I bought this movie just for that. Overall, its definitely one of those late night, I need to get to sleep, but would like to watch something as my mind drones on, kind of films. Don't buy it unless, like me, you REALL REALLY REALLY want it, just to watch that part over and over. lmao :)"
3,OK at best,"I ordered the DVD because we had the tape years ago when the kids were little. Woopie was not at her funniest, but the movie appealed somewhat to the kid in me. I've seen worse, I've seen better."
1,Fecal Matter!,"No wonder Whoopi wanted to dodge this career killer she gives a limp performance much like an actress working under the threat of a lawsuit. The effects are good though as well as one would expect for a 35 million dollar ""direct to video"" release...(To this day it is the most expensive movie made that has never played in a theater) I think Joel Shumacher aka ""I killed Batman"" could have done a better job if he were the director of this peice of bovine waste and that is saying a lot...aw screw it it would have been another reel of gay porn much like Batman Returns......."
5,Wonderful Review,"If you saw the Dionosaur show that Henson did on TV, then you will enjoy this movie, and what's not to like about Whoopi, she makes anything bad good. So don't listen to the last reviewer, if you like Whoopi, buy this vhs, and I will look out for the DVD, as well. Whoopi you ROCK."
2,it was ehh,i just dont like how his beak is like it looked good in the picture but doesnt look the same in person
2,Wrong Lens,"Totally not the same lens as the picture advertised!Old version of mount can't even fit in my 2006 Nikon D300.Original box unsealed.Dust and dirt found in the box.Instruction pocket opened.Good lens,but careless service messed up"
4,A memorable schema for how people approach decisions,"I enjoyed reading this a year ago, and recently bought a copy as a gift. I remembered it as a ""light"" read, but it's really fairly long. The authors give you a memorable perspective on how there are completely different ways of viewing decisions - appeal to consensus; appeal to facts; appeal to authority, etc. You may take that for grant, but the book really brings this perspective alive and points out that modern-world decision making requires more complex approaches that ever before."
4,Another wonderful offering from Judith Lasater,"For the most part, I think this book offers some great, clear advice. I tend to feel that Judith is a bit overly cautious. Most women I know have told me they feel much better after doing an asana practice around their period while Judith would have you skipping many of the most basic postures!Aside from that, I think this book makes a great addition for those seeking to look a bit more deeply into the practice of yogasana, both as students and as teachers."
5,Review from a beginning yoga instructor,"I recently completed a 200 hr. certification to teach yoga and I find this book invaluable. I use it for sequencing, attention to technical detail and inspiration. Judith just knows how to make each asana make sense. I only wish there were more than 30 essential poses:)"
5,30 Essential Yoga Poses,A lovely book written with care and passion for and about yoga. The poses are well-illustrated and easy to follow. I found this book very helpful when seeking information about poses and various modifications of the basic poses. It's now an oft-referred part of my yoga library.
4,smooth as silk; a Harry Connick Jr. clone,"at first listen I was sure it was Harry, but no it is Jeremy. Wonderful voice, smooth as silk. A very romantic cd"
4,"Excellent, but not perfect","This book is cyclopaedia of Phantom. It includes many many information of Phantom, for example, proto type, in combat, service, variation, weapon, equipment, and so on. And many picture, mostly of color. It uses drawing to introduce difference of per Phantom variation. This is very useful to modeler. It attach a production list of Phantom. I cannot use words to praise it. But why I just give it four star? Because if it could supply per Phantom's final result, and air to air combat record, and then it is a perfect Phantom book. But however, this book is worthy to purchasing and reading."
5,Excellent Product ~ saved our new born kitten's life,"We keep some in the fridge, just in case one of our cats has any illnesses. It was one of the main ingredient's in our new-born kittens diet that kept him healthy and alive until he was old enough to eat solids. Our little boy was found abandoned by his mother, and we got him only a couple days old. He is now our little Golden Buddah and very healthy."
5,best trance CD i own,"this CD was just...amazing, it compiles the best in trance from all over Europe into two amazing mixesCD 1 is slightly better than 2 but both are quite good, and if you are into female vocal trance this NEEDS to be in your collectionthe best songs on the CD are:Pearl (great for the dance floor with a great backbeat; sounds clearer than any other song ive ever listened to im not sure why)5 Million MilesMistral (i wish there were vocals in this song but it still has the aura and feel of a good trance song, again with a nice backbeat)"
1,"Buyer Beware - defective (ie ""copy protected"" disk)","The music is fine but if you listen to your music on a computer, be aware that the disk is ""copy protected"" (a nice way of saying ""defective by design"") so that one track won't play correctly on a computer or transfer to an iPod or MP3 player. You gets pops and stutters. Apparently the makers of the disk presume that we are all thieves and act accordingly; I wanted a legal copy on my iPod because that's how I listen to my music but no dice. They stole my money. Don't let them steal yours."
4,Gets Me In The Mood,"Ultra Chilled 01 was my first chillout collection purchase, though I have been a fan of many artists on the CD for a long time. These collections are great for anyone wanting an introduction to this sexy genre of music. The first 2CD set was a great mix of unknowns and wellknowns, and save for a couple songs was mostly all electronic. There were only a few songs I didn't like, no big deal. It was a great CD to listen all the way through. I was excited when I heard the names of some of the artists to be featured on Ultra Chilled 02. I was even more excited when I saw the girl on the cover, but that's another story. What I really like about is the combination of acoustic tracks and electronic tracks on the first disc. The second disc is complete heaven, my favorite of all. It's a perfect mix of downtempo hot and smooth electronic grooves. I've got no complaints with this newest addition at all. Most importantly, this is the best music to have sex to. Period. Love it."
4,quick & dirty,i was unfamiliar with downtempo and i found this comp a quick and easy way to get acquiainted with these artists and this genre.
5,different but just as good as the first,"what i like about ultra chilled 02 is that the tone is completely different from the first installment of this series (i wouldn't want to buy basically the same thing twice), but the quality as a chill out cd is just as good. i find these to be some of the most versatile cds in my collection and i put them on in all sorts of settings and for people with a variety of musical tastes. just a solid cd to own."
2,If you're a college freshman...,"...then you might want this to balance your Linkin Park and 50 Cent CDs when you have girls over.Otherwise, it's not worth your money. There is no mixing on the CDs, and the selections are pretty random. I like the Specials, for example, but I certainly wouldn't have included 'Ghost Town' on a downtempo mix.If you are over 20, look into releases from Eighteenth Street Lounge (i.e. home of Thievery Corp. and great compilations) and Grand Central Records, or the Naked Music series."
2,BOOOOOOOORING....,"I'm not an expert in lounge music, but I know what I like, most of us GenXers like Lounge Music that is smooth, sexy and intriguing, that's what a chilled album should have, something you can listen to while having a nice conversation with your date... However, this copilation is something that you would listen to if you want to put your date to sleep, and I'm not talking about sleeping with your date, I'm talking about watching your date sleep... all in all I thought it lacked imagination and I agree with others when they say it is way too predictable.. Nevertheless, to give it some credit (2stars) there are a couple of songs worth listening to or at least burning into a different cd.."
5,Cool Chill Tunes,"A good compilation of the latest chill tunes out there. Most of the artists are unknowns unless you club a lot, but it's all really good music."
5,Time to buy a replacement,"I bought mine directly from the manufacturer about 8 years ago. I have used it on over 100 Japanese Sika deer and Eurasian hogs. I simply cannot go hunting without it! Mine is finally worn out so I attempted to 'sharpen' it with a microfile but it is not the same as the original, but will last the next 4 weeks of this year's deer culling season. I am ordering myself a new one, and 3 more for my Japanese hunting team today. I just viewed a 'similar' product on Cabelas site but it does not have the protective tip on the bottom, so despite it being almost $10 cheaper, I am going with the one I know and trust, even though it is more expensive."
5,An excellent departure,"I wasn't certain what to expect from this odd collaboration, but it is one of the Klezmatics' best works! They seem to have taken some poems on the topic of Chanukah that were written by Woody Guthrie, who was himself not Jewish but whose wife was Jewish. They've composed music around the poetry and recorded it here.The music is terrific -- our family loves it. The two kids play this CD over and over, yet the two parents still like it (!), which by itself makes the disc an extaordinary find. But the most notable thing is that the lyrics and music sound of one piece, which is a real art given that I think the whole thing was done posthumously.Also -- I believe that there were other non-holiday poems also written by Guthrie, so they ended up making two CDs -- the other is called Wonder Wheel, though I don't own that one yet. I'll get it though, since this project was so perfectly executed."
5,Woody Guthrie's Happy Joyous Hanukkah,How could you not like something that is so sweet. We all love this cd. Shipping was fast.
5,Just What I Wanted,"Excellent product! The tara feature is wonderful. I also like the bowl that comes with it; it gives a nice wide flat surface with deep sides. I don't use the bowl all the time, so don't feel like you need to. As I weigh hamburger, I like how I can add and remove meat, as I figure out just the correct weight. Two side notes: the voice is a little loud for my taste, and as a bonus, the product works well with the voice turned off for sighted family members."
4,Basic Architecture,This book is not for beginners. The patterns match many constructs I've built over the years. It is pretty comprehensive and a foundation for the newer patterns of SOA and WOA. A good addition to any architect's library.
2,Outdated & Overly complex,"I didn't think much of this book. Martin uses really complicated words to explain simple concepts. He literally drowns in his own verbage. Although, many of the ideas discussed in the book are relevant and useful, they are also mostly intuitive to the average developer."
2,Not much more than a good history book,"Given the date this book was written, I understand the many positive reviews.Offcourse we now are almost 2012 and 10 years of evolution in IT makes a vast difference which makes this book dated.With today's ORM tools like JPA, (N)Hibernate, Torque, .. more than 50% of the book is irrelevant.It might come in handy when we would like to create our own 'sort of' implementation of such tools, but why should we...The best way to look at this book is as if you were buying a Windows Millennium book for your windows seven OS.Some things might seem helpful and maybe even are, but there is no good reason to spend 50$ or 40 on this."
4,Very good read(reread),"The patterns in the Book are not new, they are known by any average coder with few yrs of exp. How ever the book is a very coherent collection of patterns and still (in 2010) remains very relevant. But the book can use little updating in few areas like with ASP.Net MVC - .Net now supports MVC, services both in Java and WCF etc."
3,Fowler at his best? Entertaining but not so enlightening,"Fowler is one of the most read writers on the topic of object-oriented programming.Indeed, he captures the reader and most of his books, this one included, makes for a good read.However, to my mind, and this is a personal opinion, I find the whole topic of patterns for object-oriented programming vague and imprecise.I bought this book in the hope that it would reveal some structure underlying successful patterns of enterprise design, but I was disappointed."
3,If new to enterprise patterns a must read,"This is a well written book, with resonable explanations and samples. If you are familiar with patterns by GOF and distrubuted architecture patterns then there is not much new in this book. If not this is a must read and serves as a basis for platform independant review of a good cross section patterns to be applied in enterprise architecture, in which RDBMS's are always a key component. My expectations were high based on Mr Fowlers earlier works, not to say this is a lesser work, just it has been well covered before this work by Mr Fowler."
4,Impressed with the book condition,"I am very impressed with the book condition. It was mentioned as 'Good' but it's as good as a new book. No need to mention about the content of the book, because it's must book for any body looking for patterns. Overall very happy with this book purchase."
1,Crappiest architecture book,This is one of the stinky and crappiest architecture book I have read.The more i read the more I was frustated and reading further.The sample code doesnt match the explanation provided. The sentences are so vague seems that the author was drunk while writting this book ..The best part of the book is the title very fancy and inviting .. but the book is really a crap.I would recommendFramework Design GuidelinesRamesh Babu Veeramani
5,Great book,"This is one of the most useful books about patterns I've found. This book was recommended by my lecturer at university and do not regret buying it.You have to have some programming experience or you miss most of the value of this book. Although most of the examples are in Java or C# and I haven't use those languages regularly it was not difficult to understand them. Nevertheless, knowing the basics of Object-Oriented programming is a must.This book has found a solid location in my bookshelf in the handbooks section."
3,"Very good, but we don't listen to it.","This is one of those CDs created for kids, and it is very good, but all the voices are kids' voices. My kids agree with me that the Worship Jamz series is a better fit for all of us because it is geared toward a younger audience because of the tempo, but it appeals to a wider age range because of the adult voices."
2,low usability,"Not as usable as I thought it would be. My 4 y.o. plays with it but gets frustrated because once you touch the stylus on the screen, there is no way of retreiving the image unless you erase the whole thing and start all over again. Well made computer games should make it easy to get around."
1,Scam Book,"This book is full of grammatical and punctuation errors, over 170 to be exact! That makes for difficult reading. Makes you wonder about the advice in the book and who it's coming from. After all, if he can't take the time to edit his book for grammatical and punctuation errors, then did he take the time to edit for accurate advice? Would you trust someone with your money if they put out such an error-filled book? Then he advocates everyone have a financial advisor and that the advisor be well-paid. Of course! After all he's a financial advisor. I think he should write a book on how so many people have been destroyed by their financial advisor like Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Wayne Newton. And then he tries to sell a bunch of junk at the end of the book."
5,"AWESOME TOY, AWESOME GIFT, ALL KIDS LOVE","I bought this for my niece when she was born, and it has been with her since day 1. A year or so later when my son was born, I couldn't find one anywhere. I wanted him to have one too. You see, my niece was not the first child I've seen with this toy...I used to babysit twin girls that had them & they loved theirs so much. They used to sit & examine them when deciding which was which...""Didn't yours have a boo boo on its foot? Mine has a boo boo on its ear, see..."" Haha! It was fabulous. Of course I wanted to pass this love along to as many children as possible. So first came my niece, then came my son. When I found it on here, I knew I had to have it. So I purchased it & couldn't wait to see his face when he got it. To say the least, my son loved it from the very start! Everywhere he went, it had to go with him. 4 OUT OF 4 CHILDREN ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT!! Makes for a great gift. Kids are just drawn to it for some reason. Love it!! :o)"
5,The Cutest Bear Ever!,"I bought this bear after searching for another stuffed animal and came across him, Once I saw him I had to buy him. He is very cute being a bear dressed in a baby bunnysuit. I have a few family friends who are expecting a baby and I now know what I will buy them.I just wished amazon sold the other colors as my one friend has decided to wait to find out the gender of her baby, which makes buying a gift a little bit more diffficult.He apparently cleans up well too.The bear is certainly affordable, is incredibly soft and very cute, I am very glad I bought him!"
5,Great Bear!,Great Stuffed Bear! Our daughter received this bear when she was born from her aunt. She has not let go of it! She uses it like a security blanket. Like the other reviewers said it is very soft and cleans great! I just throw in the Washer & Dryer. I am going to order another one as back up as well. My daughter also plays with the long ears until she goes to sleep! Great gift!
5,MOSES (THE BIBLE COLLECTION),THIS IS ONE OF MY FAVORATE MOVIES THUS FAR. BEN KINGSLEY DOES A GREAT JOB OF PIN-POINTING THE BIBLE'S DESCRIPTION OF THE CHARACTER OF MOSES. THIS IS AN INSPIRING MOVIE THAT WILL BE TREASURED IN MY HOME.
2,Didn't watch all of it,"Its so hard to beat ""The Ten Commandments""We watched about 30 minutes of this, pulled it out, dusted off Charlton Heston, popped some popcorn, and watched it to the end.Although we really like Ben Kingsley in most everything else, we will probably give this one away.I'm sure someone would appreciate it."
3,Moses (The Bible Collection),"I enjoyed the movie. It was more realistic than The 10 Commandments which was done for theatraical purposes. However, it did not follow scripture very well. First it showed Moses as a child when he was not heard of from the time he was put on the Nile until he was about 30. Secondly it showed him leaving his wife behind when he returned to Egypt. The Bible clearly states he took his wife and sons. Another account was when the people wanted to hear God too. The movie showed God speaking the 10 commandments through the people when God gave them to Moses when he was on Mt. Siani. There were many other things in the movie that did not follow scripture. It was worth watching and I won't throw it away but I don't highly recommend it if you are wanting a Biblical account of Moses."
4,Very good,"This movie follows the text of the Bible fairly well. Most of the acting is decent, though some scenes look a bit stilted. I used this movie as part of class on Moses and I selected it based largely on its value in that arena."
2,Moses,"I have only watched about 20 minutes of this presentation, so this may be a bit unfair. The acting is superb. Ben Kingsley is at the top of his game. I am teaching a Bible Study on Exodus, and this video does not even try on some points to be biblically correct. For example, Pharaoh's daughter retrieves Moses from the river and not Miriam his sister. This is just one example, and like I said, I have only watched 20 minutes of this video."
5,Great product,I have used Miracle Gro for over 40 years and I certainly would recommend using it to anyone.I hope to continue using it for another 40 years.
5,Great Learning tool and fun.,"Well, It's a puzzle. No batteries, no tv, or cartridge required. My kids enjoy video games like most kids, inasmuch we occasionally force on them an educational toy of sorts. This is one that they both enjoy (they are 7 and 8).The puzzle itself, is of what Id gander is a high quality/density cardboard. Whats particularly nice about it is a majority of the pieces are often a country, state or territory (depending on which puzzle you are doing. We have several of these).Aside from the enjoyment most kids get out of doing a puzzle, questions arise out of them in which i know they are learning. ""Dad, there are two Washingtons?"" ""What does D.C. stand for?"", ""Alaska is one of the biggest states isn't it"" and so on....Though they are not exactly cheap for a typical puzzle, in my opinion you are getting your moneys worth for what the kids walk away with. A better understanding of the world we live in."
1,Missing Pieces,"Just opened this puzzle for Christmas and put it together with my son. Puzzle was fun, he loved doing it but towards the end we realized an entire side of the puzzle was missing. Dont buy this product, it didnt even come with all the pieces! Waste of money!"
2,GeoPuzzle USA and Canada,Puzzle is very colorful and I was sure my 5 year old grandson would learn a great deal from it. However the puzzle pieces would not hold together and my grandson became very frustrated with it. He absolutely loves puzzles and I thought we would have great fun doing this one. It went back in the box and I'm not sure when it will come out again.
4,Geo puzzle of US and Canada,I liked the sound of this product but did not see it as I had it sent direct to a nephew in L.A.!
2,2 problems,"Some comments pointed out that the puzzle pieces don't lie flat and don't stay together, I've found them both true.Pieces don't lie flat: not many, but enough to spoil the look of the completed puzzle.Pieces don't stay together: the problem is that too many pieces have straight edges. You basically place the pieces side by side, instead of interlocking them."
5,Our new favorite,"This Christmas album has taken over the top spot in our case of nearly 50 Christmas CD's. In true bluegrass form Patty shares the vocals and even sings harmony on ""Little Drummer Boy"". Her dedication to her art is beyond ego gratification and the music shines."
5,spectacular,"patty loveless will always be superior to all country singers.she sings country, others who title themselves country singers are pop singers. her voice is smooth and soothing as summer winds."
3,Nice to add a new holiday CD to the mix,"Patty Loveless, like too many others, has recorded a holiday CD of standards with little new music here. Since I did not have a P.L. holiday CD in my mix I picked it up. Not bad, but not great. Price was right."
4,Good CD,I just received this Christmas album and have started listening to Christmas music 2 months early.
5,Christmas Celebration Music,"Ran across this CD on the website, listened and fell in love with it. My husband is more into bluegrass than I am but this CD is great for everyone. This rendition of Carol of the Bells is one of the best cuts on the CD. Her version of ""Little Drummer Boy"" is great as it's not the usual hum-drum sound. Also, Christmas Day At My House, really puts you in the spirit. Great CD."
5,Took me home for Christmas,"Being from Eastern Kentucky and now living in Houston, this album literally took us ""back home"".Patty's return to her roots in Bluegrass are evident in this album as was the case in her excellent ""Mountain Soul"" album released a couple years ago.This album has already become one of our all time favorites in a fairly vast assortment of Christmas albums. It is fabulous!"
5,"Is This Woman Underrated, Or What?!?","I can't think of any woman in country music -- even pop music -- whose voice can compare to the lyrical quality and emotional depth of Patty Loveless. Combine that with holiday music and you have nothing short of high art. This work, like all her others, showcases not only the flawless voice, but the import of each individual composition as well. When I consider what today has to offer with respect both to music and to artists, I take safe haven in the voice of Patty Loveless and her ilk."
4,Olympus C4000 is a real,"C4000's consistently excellent performance and superb image quality make the camera a real option for any demanding photography enthusiast, especially those on a budget. The Olympus C4000 is a real value that offers the opportunity for digital photographers to enjoy the performance and features of a high-end prosumer digital camera (like the Nikon CP4500 or the Canon G3) for hundreds of dollars less. I highly recommend this camera. In terms of ""bang for your buck"" the Olympus C4000 is in a class all by itself. So, if you've been waiting for the perfect digital camera at the right price, this camera may be as good as it is going to"
4,"Good, authentic 'Hillbilly' country music for Christmas!","Patty is a true country star, and keeps this album from getting too 'popish'. Even the traditional carols take on new life with fiddles, mandolins and banjos in support. The guest list is as long as a honky-tonk dance line, including Emmy Lou Harris, Trisha Yearwood and Ricky Skaggs to name a few. Best of all, several original songs give this collection some nice flavor, my favorites being 'Santa Train' and the title cut 'Bluegrass and White Snow'. So real, unlike too much country these days--I even heard the word 'yonder' in the lyrics somewhere!"
5,Most Awesome Christmas CD EVER!,This is the absolute best Christmas CD ever! I even listen to it year round. Great to play while putting up the tree. I always give a copy to my son's teachers for a Christmas gift...spreading the gift of Patty!
1,a bad textbook to learn plant phys,"This is an introductory book, so I do not expect it to go in-depth in each area. There are many typos in this book though, like a lot of page numbers in the index are not correct. Also, the book goes in an odd order, and a lot of things explained later in the book wouldv'e made it easier to understand some of the earlier things easier. a lot of newer concepts are left out too, or vaguely mentioned, like electric currents in plants. My professor often has to use graphs and charts from other books because the ones from the book are too complicated or hard to understand, such as the Z-scheme, the Q cycle, and the PCR cycle to name a few. I would not recommend this book as an introductory textbook."
5,Excellently written & easy to understand,"For a simple explanation of some very complex topics, I have found William Hopkins' text much more useful than the Taiz. Taiz was assigned for my class, but I have turned to the Hopkins, which was in the university library. With Hopkins, each sentence flows into the next and it is much easier to follow. Also, Hopkins is more up to date when mentioning current research. I wish I had bought the Hopkins...I haven't come across so many typos to be disturbed by them. It is strange that the Hopkins' text was not edited for the typos, while Taiz's was not edited for readability..."
1,the book in general,"I thought that this book contained a lot of information on this subject, however this information is useless in the way it is presented. Hopkins, must have been the type of person to sit in a dark room by himself with no one around, reading botany books, because he certainly doesn't know how to relate to other people in presenting this subject."
4,introduction of plant physiology,1.Why IBA biosynthetic doesn't appear inside this book?2.Does IBA biosynthetic discovered yet?I think it would be better if IBA biosinthetic can be described in this book.I'm waiting your answerthank you very muchSemarang Indonesiarudi
3,Very expensive!,"This was a required text for my doctoral program. The book itself is full of good information, but light on the analysis of the cases. You need to have a good instructor to help with the analysis and discussion of the cases and their importance to the law. Majority of the book is case decisions.The book itself is extremely expensive. I sold mine back to Amazon, but if this is for a course ask your friends and other students to lend a copy for the course. You likely will never need this information again unless you specifically get into law.. and if you do you can always obtain the case records free from the library."
1,Worst law book I've encountered,"This book is full of subtle typos (an extra ""not"" can really confuse the reader) and omitted sentence fragments, which render whole paragraphs incomprehensible. Not only that, it does not give you a clear idea of where the law currently stands on anything. I suppose it does make for an interesting historical read, as much of the information presented is outdated.I ordered the Nutshell today, and am hoping it will give me some structure.If you have to use this book, start looking around for a study guide early on."
1,Don't waste your money,This is a rare instance where you're better off just buying the Nutshell. The full casebook is mostly filler: page after page of statutes. There's very little helpful commentary or analysis. You can get pretty much the same material in the Nutshell for a lot less money.
5,this is as joyful as it gets!,"This anthology has it all! the most joyfilled, happy,cheerful music from jamaica."
2,VERY poor sound quality!!! :(,"WARNING!!!!! Bit-rate is too LOW @ a horrible 167-170kbps!!! :^( I fixing to call customer service for a full refund since it says in the item drescription this is a ""remastered"" recording, and average MP3 bit rates on Amazon are supposed to be ""256""!..."
4,Gift item.,Purchased as a gift from a wish list. Good deal for the price. Warm and cozy. Good quality. Price is reasonable.
4,Good old fashioned warm knee socks!,"Sturdy cable-knit acrylic knee socks, good selection of colors, timely delivery and a great price! Glad to know that some things still stay the same!!"
3,Nice socks,"These are nice socks but they are on the small side. Out of 6 pair 2 were big enough to be comfortable and the rest were way too tight. I love the colors and the way they are made, if only they were bigger!"
2,Not what I was expecting,"I was very disappointed in these socks. They are not very long, barely coming up over my calf (I am 5'5 so not all that tall) and these are certainly not knee high, which is what I was expecting. They are not very stretchy, which makes them uncomfortable across the toes and does not keep them from sliding down the leg. These socks are ""cable knit"" in design only; they are not suitable for winter wear as they are quite thin and offer no warmth for the feet and legs. I would characterize them more as being ""trouser socks"" or dress socks. Now I am wondering what to do with six pairs of socks I don't like. I would not recommend these sock to anyone."
3,good socks,"They stay up nicely. They're not as soft as I was expecting, actually a little rough but not uncomfortable. I wish I could find some a little thicker and a lot softer."
1,Over sentimental garbage.,"I am not dogging out on Jump5, but I AM dogging on this Lee Greenwood song they chose to cover. Britney Spears nor Backstreet Boys would not faired singing this either, and Barbara Mason as well as Ashford and Simpson would irk me just the same.I do not like this song, it is overly sentimental and makes the USA out to be higher than it ought to think of itself.The USA is a great country but it is not perfect and with all this political mess going on, this song just does not reflect my feelings as yet it seems to make me feel guilty for not doing so. I do not appreciate that at all.Just to make a point that I am not downing Jump5, I own their second album because the two songs Throw Your Hands Up and All I Can Do."
4,WOW!,"Power, speed, melody, attitude, excellant strong vocals, true musicmanship=Iron Savior, this is much better than the 1st release."
3,"Bah, so-so","This recording has some strngths, but it really is notoutstanding. Some tracks are terrific: Coming Home, Eye To Eye andtheir take on Black Sabbath's Neon Knights are all fine, but the rest all tend to blur together. If you adore Gamma Ray (Kai Hansen is a member of Iron Saviour as well), then this album will satisfy you. Otherwise pass this by, you won't miss that much."
3,Buy it if you love thrash metal/hate progressive metal,"Do the opposite if you hate thrash metal/ love progressive metal.As one who likes both forms, the recording strikes me in between.If this was a 10 star rating I would give it 7/10.I love the terrific vocals that are apparent in most progressive metal bands.I love the force and energy that is apparent in most thrash metal bands.I do not like the drumming which one could have used a drum machine because it is basically continuous 32nd beats throughout.There is very little harmony and melody in this recording as well, especially compared to other power metal bands like Helloween and Stratovarious.Put it this way, if you think the latest works by these two above mentioned bands are way too light and likewise believe the same thing in the latest works by Gamma Ray; you will love this recording."
4,what a joy,We really love and enjoyed watching this movie. Even my boys who are typically the modern guys who usually don't share the same interest with their mom especially on movies amazingly love the movie. One thing the whole family shared the same view and appreciated much the relationship between the 2 brothers - the love between them is great. My two boys Harold even compared himself to the eldest and my youngest Leonard with Eli.Amusing!!!Can't wait for the 2nd season to be released!! thanks =
2,Eli Stoned,"""Eli Stone"" sounded promising when it was pitched. A high-powered San Francisco attorney finds himself having psychic abilities. He's got a brain tumor--so his talent might very well be his downfall. In the first episode, Eli is making love to his glamorous girlfriend (Natasha Henstridge),when he's interrupted by George Michael. To make matters worse, George Michael is the long-running motif of the show. He may very well represent the Almighty. It does bring up questions about the Almighty's sexual orientation.""Eli Stone"" tries to blend lawyer drama with musical numbers. It's like the short-lived CBS show with Hugh Jackman and Melanie Griffith. But that show was wisely cancelled. How this one lasts--I don't know.""Eli Stone"" comes across as a bad acid trip. Avoid."
2,A disappointment,"I, too, started out liking this program but it started to head downstream fast. I cannot stand Eli's assistant who is snotty to everyone including the boss's daughter and still manages to keep her job. I would have had her kicked out when it first started. She isn't funny - just annoying. The other thing that bothered me was the Earthquake episode where at the end Eli rails at God for not sending him the earthquake to save face with his secretary. Huh? Even if an earthquake was still to come, isn't it kinder for God to wait until the residents had time to find new homes and move out? I get sick of TV shows like this where it is trendy to curse at God and elevate themselves as the so-called saviors. So cliche and it's bad."
4,A Nice Reference for Natural Hair Care,"This is a good book for basic care of natural hair. If you're considering going natural, you should definately pick this up. Plus, it's a good reference to have because it's information everyone can use."
4,A Lovely well informed book,This book was very helpful in getting me to understand how to maintain healthy hair. I wish there was more information for ladies who are thinking about the practical transition from permed back to natural hair with locks.
4,"Right on time for me,","I finally decided to hear what other ""natural"" women had to say about going natural and I'm relieved! I was glad to see that going natural is a big decision for most Black women who decide to do it. I thought the book was funny, informative and enlightening. I did expect to see a few more examples of natural do's, but maybe I expected too much. But, all and all, this is a very good book. This is the first book I've read of this nature so I've been encouraged to buy more and see how other sisters are ""doing"" it. Thanks so much for helping me feel proud of what God gave me to work with."
3,Not so helpful,"I thought it was a funny and cute book, but overall it was not what I expected. My hair has been natural so I did not find the book too helpful. It was a nice read but if you are looking for a hair bible this is not it. This book is helpful only if you are unsure about going natural and would like to hear stories of another woman's hair story."
4,"Funny, informative and a nice little reference tool","Lonnice has charm, wit and intelligence which comes bursting through the pages of this little book. While I am definitely in favor of chemical free hair (that means no chemical texturizing either) you can still use a lot of the info in this book. I have found that texturizing can be done naturally by cornrowing or twisting your hair. See Pamela Ferrell's book about this subject matter. I think you should include this book in your library as a reference guide because it does have some goods tips, especially about conditioning your hair. Some of the products can't be found anymore but hey there are others that can be substituted and as long as you understand the concept Lonnice is trying to convey who cares what the product is called, just do it."
4,What a relief!,"I had become more and more interested in growing out my relaxer and wearing my hair natural. After finding enough information on the internet, and finally decided to do the big chop. I bough Lonnice Bonner's book so get some more tips on how to style and care for my hair. It's a really great, and very funny book which talks about Lonnice's personal hair experience. It gives great advice on how to care for natural hair, and shows some pictures and styles. The only reason I give it 4 stars and not 5, is because I was lookiing more for some intructions on how to actually do styles. But I would definitely recommend this book. It's an easy read."
4,Ooo La La!,"Found this little gem at a rather large British Music Chain Store, wherein they have a resident DJ...any ideas darlings?An absolute must for those who are the torchbearers of all that is hip and swank.French 60's kitsch pop intertwined with sampling that is out of this world..baby! It reminds me of 'Our Man Flynt"", 'The Party' and 'I Love you Alice B. Toklas' avec a soupson of 'Barbarella' thrown in for good space-age measure.You can be catapulted into one of those swingin 60's parties where the jet-set meet the bohemians meet the gurus meet the starlets...why is that Princess Margaret I see?This gives 'Sacre Bleu' by Dimitri from Paris a bit of the old run for his money, but not quite as polished.Fantastic...buy it!"
5,great soundtrack,this album has some quality tunes and i recommend it to anyone into the late 60s style...the one thing however is that some songs are too short....and having a total length of just over 50 minutes i am sure an extra few minutes on some of the songs would not hurt!
2,for people new to backing up enterprise servers,If you are familiar with backing up Oracle databases using Veritas NetBackup or Legato Networker you probably have most of the knowledge in this book. I saw no surprises or neat little tricks. Probably good for operations managers who need a guide on backing up there enterprise database servers. You can get most of the information on this book off of the web. Save your money.
1,Barnga- few ideas and lots of useless paper,Very disappointed in this book. It is basically a glorified and expensive card game with a book that comes in 6 languages while you only need one! Very strange way to make money....expected much more!
3,Games,"It took a bit of time for me to figure out the purpose of this game. It is written in a complicated manner that is difficult to decipher. Once I did , I felt it might be used in my professional work. I was disappointed because it is unlike the other of Thiagi's works which can be used immediately."
2,Good but...,"Easy come, easy go... There are good songs there but, usually, after a certain number of listenings, they lose their ""magic"" and I was wondering why?... Maybe Libido's music has an inmediate appeal (commercially speaking), but doesn't resists the test of time... Another thing is that Libido lacks of originality in their compositions. They often make songs that you probably heard before, with a different name. Listening to Libido is like listening to a second hand Oasis, Radiohead, Nirvana or, somehow, Joan Osborne (check the initial guitar arrangement in ""En esta habitacion"", almost a cheap copy of Osborne's hit ""One Of Us"" )... Although, I still like tracks as ""Tres"", ""Tu rostro"" and ""Hembra""."
5,"Tres, what a song !!","This song called Tres is one of the coolest rock songs I have ever heard. All the other songs from this album are pretty awesome too. Great album, great singer, great band, worth listening to it."
5,Amazing descovery!,"This is the best book in mime history I have ever seen since Allardyce Nicoll's ""Masks, Mimes and Miracles"" and there's no other as contemporary as this."
1,If you want to cry your eyes out,"I can't believe how sad this movie was,huge disappointment. Not about the dog at all, but more about the people around him. It was advertised as a funny , happy dog movie but it was sooooo sad specially towards the end. Its bad enough that every dog parent has to,one day, go through losing their dog but also has to watch the painful moments in this movie. What's really bad is that it opened on X-mas day. I mean who in the world want to cry their eyes out around the holidays? sad sad movie!"
1,BORING....,"save your money, buy the book instead ...I saw nothing that made this ""the family movie of the year"" ... the dog certainly didn't, and neither did Owen nor Jennifer ...what a yawn ... I turned it off half way through ...dont waste your time ..."
1,"Vow kept, vow broken","In this movie, my firm vow to always watch whatever movie stars Owen Wilson has clashed with my equally strong vow to never, ever watch anything with Jennifer Aniston in it. After some internal debate, my disgust with Aniston won over and so I have not watched this movie, nor will I.Aniston is a blight on humanity. She's a loser. She threw away the love of her life because she wouldn't have his -- or anybody's -- child. She thinks too much of her body to ""ruin it"" with childbearing. That's not somebody I want to see, ever, anywhere."
1,Movie unreceived,Still have not received this movie.... was ordered as a mother's day gift.. what's taking so long??
4,great flick,"We loved the movie..... We have a dog we love so we could relate with the whole movie. Funny, cute, and entertaining"
3,It's Okay,"The movie itself was okay. I'm not going to recap the movie, if you want that, you can go to Wikipedia and read it.I got the instant video edition of it. Here is the pro: you don't ever have to replace a movie or worry about it being scratched or damaged like you do with a disc. The con is that all you get is the movie. There is no bonus feature like you would get on a disc or any option of subtitle or audio. I guess with a movie like this it didn't bother me, but it might be of concern to purchasers that wanted a classic like Gone With the Wind. I would definitely recommend people get classics on a disc instead of instant video because of the lack of any options other than to watch the movie."
5,A Wonderful Tribute To Man's Best Friend!,"""Marley and Me,"" is a wonderful tribute to man's bestfriend. A very touching and moving film that's fun for the entire family. This film has a deeper meaning as it guides one to realize just how precious life is and how fast life moves.ALL ABOUT MEMiles to GoMichelle RossiContributing Author Chicken Soup for the Soul"
2,Read the book. Forget the movie.,Marley & Me the book was about an energetic dog and its effect on a family. Marley & Me the movie was about a couple who happen to have kids and a destructive dog. All the charm was lost in the transition. Skip the movie. Embrace the book.
5,multifacted overlooked gem,"Is this a story about the dog, Marley? Yes and no. What a truly great movie. I'm glad they never gave up on him or each other when life got stressful. So many lessons can be learned here. I plan on also picking up the book. Owen Wilson's nose is hard to watch though, haha"
3,"Not for you kids, but a nice movie","This movie is not for the family. If the producers had changed a few scenes, edited out the language and the sex, it could have been a classic family favorite, and I would have purchased it.Another book that would be better left to read. Film industry let down."
3,I thought I would like this better,"After all the trailers and hype about this movie I had expected that I would enjoy it more than I did. I'm a dog lover and I love all animals, but this movie just didn't do it for me. Let me start by saying that I didn't read the book. So I wasn't sure exactly what to expect. I thought the movie was kind of shallow and that I didn't really get to know the characters. There were some great scenes, but I just didn't feel close to them. Part of it may have been the acting, but mostly I think it was just the writing. So much of it just seemed kind of a cliche.I thought the ending was way overdone and unnecessary. Anyone who has had the sad experience of having to put a pet to sleep can relate, but I thought the scene in the vet's office was far too graphic too long. It brought back too many sad memories and left a bad feeling about the movie rather than a good one. It kind of overshadowed the whole movie for me."
2,woof woof -- this movie's a dog,"Some dog lovers might really enjoy MARLEY AND ME. However, if you're indifferent to dogs or dislike them then this movie won't do much to change your mind. To me this was an annoying film for the most part about the most annoying dog ever. The movie plods along repetitiously with one irksome dog scene after another. I could only wonder why in the world would anyone keep such an annoying animal-- especially in the house. Not the worst movie in the world, but I would recommend spending your time with a film with a better story that is not about people who keep an animal in the house that is so destructive. If you're gonna go that route then a better choice might be CUJO."
2,not very happy,"I'm giving this movie as a gift for Christmas and although the discs themselves were in good shape, the case was horribly beaten up. It's kind of embarrassing so I may end up buying the same thing from someone else because I don't want to give it as a gift."
2,Me or the Dog,"Two important issues with this movie:(1.) The author of the book, the script writer and the director must never have heard of the long running Animal Planet's ""Me or the Dog"". If they had they would not have presented such a misguided movie with regards to understanding and training an out-of-control dog. Which, incidentally, was suppose to be the central element to this story.(2.) I had this unsettling feeling though out the movie that I was not watching real ordinary people dealing with a dog and life but actors characterizing people in some contrived unrealistic life. I just saw actors. A well directed and acted movie should move you into another world and not make you feel like you're a director observing acting class."
2,Really Sad,"This movie is fine until it decides to have a long, drawn out depressing ending. This movie was supposed to be a comedy or kids movie based on the trailer and my whole family and I were so upset after leaving the theater. We were not prepared for that. We all left crying. The whole theater was crying..grown men as well. It's true to life but I think what happens in the end didn't need to be so long and drawn out to the point to where you are bawling for the last 20 minutes or more. It would have been better if the trailer had not been so misleading. This is not really a comedy..it's more of a drama with a few comedic scenes. It is sad so be prepared. As long as you know what you are getting into, then maybe this movie is alright."
1,NOT a family movie,"I was seriously disappointed ... and somewhat disturbed ... by this movie. The previews and descriptions make it out to be cute, funny, and romantic. It is NOT. It is one depressing or tragic situation after another for both human and dog in this story. It does not even seem to me to be a story about the dog as much as a story about a man who had to come to grips with the depressing reality that he will never fulfill his life's dreams. It might have been a good movie as a drama if it had been described as such. But since the expectations are set elsewhere it's hard to judge it according to its proper genre. And this is definitely NOT a kid's movie. Do not let young children watch this!"
3,A good Slap Upside the Head for Kids...,"The Marley and Me DVD is a good buy for people who like this type of film. It has plenty of extras, everything you want to know about this mediocre film. So what is the big deal about this movie?For me, as someone who owned/trained dogs, bad dogs have bad owners. Stunts that this mutt pulls would be extremely dangerous for real and would be a sign of some kind of doggy brain damage. So, this movie was not very funny in my opinion.Owen Wilson - now he is working with animals; from Eddie Murphy to Jackie Chan, now pairing up with a (non-talking) dog. Next it will be puppets..The ending - I knew this was coming, since the movie manages not to be about anything so the ending had to grab you emotionally somehow. Not for little kids (who will want to see this film).Maybe the sequel will be better: ""Where is that B@^#%!"" - Starring Michael Vic and his dog ""Bait""."
1,Shoot this dog - please!,"I have not read the original book, but this movie is the stupidest film I have seen in a long time. The subject, the dog, is a jerk with no redeeming feature whatsoever - at least none demonstrated by the film. This movie is nearly two hours long, spends about an hour and forty minutes demonstrating what a worthless turd he is, and then its final 15 minutes showing the family inexplicably decompensating as he - whom the family has heretofore always regarded as a pain - dies. (And good riddance, I say.) The tear-jerking doesn't work, because the dog has never been shown to have a single redeeming feature. In any other country in the world, this destructive, stupid, untrainable, unlovable animal would have been eaten about 30 minutes into the film. Then you could have used the next hour and a half of your life for something productive, like looking at a blank wall."
1,"Warning, this disc will NOT play on your Television DVD or your computer","We ordered this version and found that the second disc would play on our TV, but the movie would not play.So we tried it on all our computers, same problem would not play on any of them.Though it would import into iTunes, but what good is that, if your grandkids want to watch the movie on your 40 inch TV.So its no good to us, though in tiny print on the back of the box, it does say that it will play on 'portable digital movie players', so I am donating this to our library.And we bought a new TV compatible version of Marley and Me at our local WalMart.I suggested to Amazon rep. that a warning please be placed on the Amazon ordering site for this particular movie, so that people will not fall into the trap that I did.Jane"
3,"this movie had a theme, if I detect it right","I didn't think this was a good movie but it has a giant dog, Marley, so I give it three stars instead of two. My problem with this movie may have been Jennifer Aniston. She is unlikable in the film? Is that the part she normally plays, the unlikable, whiny, unhappy yuppie woman. . ? Perhaps the simple nature of this tale can't compete with more elaborate productions. I just didn't think it was a good movie for whatever reason.I think this movie had a theme, if I detect it right. This movie is about a man learning to love, tolerate and respect another creature. In this case Marley. There is a lot to tolerate. It isn't so much about the dog as the man. I'd like to think the man in this film stands for all of us."
5,Heart-warming,This was an amazing movie many people could relate to. I cried my eyes out. This is a movie I would definitely recommend.
4,Marley and Me by Brandon M. Moskos,"O.K., this is not your typical happy dog movie that has been done a million times anyways. This is a movie about a family and how their dog becomes part of the family. I think a lot of people missed the point of the movie. People think that this was supposed to be about this cute little dog that's so perfect. It's really about how a dog can effect your life and be there through your ups and downs. This is so true because animals love unconditionally. Marley was a part of their family, just like my dog is a part of my family. This movie is not perfect at all, but I enjoyed it because it was real and sincere. It didn't show this made-up perfect family movie, it clearly showed typical problems that couples and families have. I thought Jennifer Aniston could have been better and I thought the stabbing of the neighbor scene was tasteless. But I enjoyed it because it shows just how close the human and dog relationship can be. I recommend this movie."
4,"Great movie, delayed delivery","Movie is adorable!! Great for dog lovers. Brand new condition, just backordered for like 4 weeks."
4,Marley and Me Review,Marley & Me (Three-Disc Bad Dog Edition) [Blu-ray]The movie is great. So worth the money.
4,Soft Spot for Dogs,Excellent movie for the dog lovers. I dont give it a 5 star only because im not into family movies as much. This movie has everything in it. Laughter sadness and everything in between. If anything definitely see this movie. I LOVED it!!
4,Not Tunner & Hooch Funny,"Good movie but not the Comedy advertised, funny yes, Tuner & Hooch funny no.I know,I know, but when you compare this to the best Dog Comedy ever made nothing will come even close"
3,"great movie, way off on the rating","This was a very funny movie! I recommend it completely. Only thing is it is NOT a family movie. Light language, many issues with sex, borderline nudity, not a movie to have your 6 year old see without having a talk about death, sex and how adults (mostly men) act and what they do, meaning sex. Touches base with mostly adult reality. This movie should definitely have gotten at least a PG-13 rating. I was horrified sitting there watching the movie with my 5 year old daughter. ""what did he just say?' Why did he look at her like that?"" ""What are they doing in the bed?"" Not a ""family"" movie. UP is a family movie.... Finding Nemo is a family movie. Even Shrek is a family movie. No idea what they were thinking with this rating. Shame on them.um.... other than that, a great funny, sappy movie, and people should see it, just not children."
4,"""Marly and Me"" is not a light hearted comedy","I put off watching this movie because I knew what the ending had to be about,and it was going to KILL me,and I was right.( I had to keep reminding myself that a dog excepts dying,and knows its a part of life.)""Marley and Me""is not really comedy, but the acting is great,and worth seeing for all of us dog lovers."
4,Marley & Me,"I like the product distribution...BLUE RAY, DVD, and MP format. Regarding the actual movie: It is a favorite of mine. The dog actually reminded me of a dog I owned when growing up. Very unruly, but, a very good companion.Marley & Me (Three-Disc Bad Dog Edition) [Blu-ray]"
2,Troubled Dog....,"The movie seemed long, silly, and slapstick. How often can you watch a dog get in trouble? And, of course, since a dog's lifespan is about 20% of a human's, the end is predictable, and predictably maudlin.If you aren't already fond of Owen Wilson and Jennifer Aniston, this will probably not make you into a fan. If you haven't seen Kathleen Turner in a while you are in for a shock."
5,Marley Lives On,"Having read John Grogan's book from which this movie was based, I was only slightly disappointed that some of my favorite scenes from the book didn't make it into the film. Fitting all the detail from the book into a 2 hour film was a cumbersome task. Director David Frankel and the two leads do a fine job in bringing the Grogans' and Marley's story to the film. Marley And Me the film follows the story and the spirit of the book. Anyone's who's ever had a dog knows how important they can be to your life, and losing them is heartbreaking. If you loved the book, you'll love the movie. If you didn't read it, you'l find that Marley and Me is still a very good movie not just a 'dog movie'."
4,Connection to every Dog Lover,"This movie was well done with Owen WIlson and Jenifer Aniston. It followed the book well. Funny and sad, it shares the common experience of most dog owners. Yes, the owner was not the best trainer, but the point is the love that occurs when sharing your life with a pet."
3,Good with a not so good ending ---,"This turned out to be a good movie -- filled with all kinds of the right stuff -- however -- someone should have warned you about the ending --- it smacked of ""Lassie Come Home"" --- the dog dies at the end and it's sad --- in this day and age of unemployment, foreclosures and wars we need movies with happy endings. I saw this movie once and promptly gave it to a neighbor --- have absolutely no need to see it again..."
3,case came broken,The dvd is fine but the case was broken because it was not packaged properly for mailing.
2,"this is a depressing film, not so called family comedy","I read the book, I thought it was good so I wanted to see the film. I thought from the previews that they had lightend up a bit, I was wrong. The adverts tell of a great comedy for the whole family. Miscarriages, and marital problems are not so funny, and lets do the whole old yeller thing to top it off. Booo."
3,a surprisingly good movie (for adults),"My husband and I could completely relate to what they're going through, it was like watching ourselves in many ways.The movie was really funny and how the couple deeply loved ""the world's worst dog"" was very heart warming.The movie suffers a bit of an identity crisis, though.- possible minor spoiler -It starts out as a good romantic comedy, but gets quite sad towards the end (if you're a dog lover). Our spirit was dampened afterwards.The movie is from a grown-ups' perspective, too sad for a comedy, not dramatic enough to be a drama, not romantic enough to be a romance. I don't know how to categorize it, but we didn't regret watching it."
2,Should Have Been PG-13,"I read the book. I knew it would be sad. But I also knew it would be funny, as Marley was quite the character.Generally, when books are made into movies, something gets lost in the translation from book to screen. That said, I didn't have high expectations. With a PG rating though, I thought it would be 'safe' enough to allow my 5 and 6 year old to watch Marley's antics. How wrong I was. We ended up turning it off about 20 minutes into the movie. The sexual innuendos aren't the kind that go over the kids' heads. They were pretty blatant, which was surprising given its PG rating. This should have been PG-13, no question.Later, when the kids were in bed, my husband and I gave it another shot. It was just 'ok'. Pick up the book if you're really interested in Marley and how he was the 'worst dog' ever."
1,Not good if you have young children,"This keeps on getting great reviews, but the ending is such a bad tear jerker for small kids. Unless you've recently lost a pet this is NOT a good family movie unless you plan to talk about death and dying with your kids at the end."
1,disappointed,"the trailer of this film gave the impression that it would be light-hearted, funny, and great for adults as well as children. it wasn't. it's a tear-jerker. if you are a fan of OLD YELLER!, you'll love it! i am glad that i watched it before making it a gift to my niece; i chose to toss it in a drawer instead!"
1,If you ever put a dog to sleep DON'T WATCH!,I thought this was a comedy for kids. If you have ever had to put a loved pet to sleep don't watch. It is like reliving the vet visit. If you want to show this to kids stop after the trip to the vet and the kids bus ride home where Marley is waiting. That would make a good ending for kids or sensitive family members. I personally will not watch it again.
2,SAD! Not for all family members!,"PLEASE NOTE: Marley is an adorable dog and yes, the antics are really very cute throughout the movie. However, I am VERY disappointed this movie was advertised as a movie about Marley's antics. I was NOT prepared for what the movie ended up to be and I was sorry I took the kids who left in tears. Perhaps all kids wouldn't be in tears, but mine were. I know I was!I would NOT recommend buying this as a gift for a child and their family if you haven't previewed it yourself to see if it's okay."
4,It was a cute movie,"I really enjoyed this movie...I read the book first and in all fairness if you have not read the book, i recommend doing so- they really left a whole bunch of details out for the movie purposes. It was a cute movie, and I think that alot of pet owners will enjoy it. I do have to say though that at the end, I was sobbing like crazy, and im 20. It just reminded me of when my Siberian Husky Samantha passed away, so I warn that it is a little bit sad, but it does happen in life. Overall, I thought it was a pretty great movie."
3,"Predictable, and pretty boring!","This is a decent movie, nice storyline, cute dog, popular cast. However, i read such great reviews of it, and was expecting a fantastic movie. Didn't think it was all that. It actually put my 4 year olds to sleep! My husband and I kept looking at eachother like ""are we going to turn it off?"" He made a valid point when he said everytime you think something major is going to happen, it doesnt... it just drags on.If you've lived this story, you got together with someone, got married, you bought a dog, and then decided to start a family, than you can relate to the movie. It does explain a dogs life SO well. BUT it drags on too much. Maybe as a dog owner I just know the story too well.... Just wasnt that impressed with Marley and Me."
3,A weaker version of MY DOG SKIP,"Without saying more than is neccessary, I best summarize this movie as a weaker version of MY DOG SKIP.MY DOG SKIP being the vastly superior movie."
1,miserable movie,"First, shame on the studio who advertised like a family movie! The kids only cared for the beginning and the tear jerking end. A total of 30 minutes perhaps. The dog was barely the focus of the movie and I do mean barely (if at all)...it was more about Wilson's life and his relationship with Aniston (far too realistic and dreary, much of the sexual content was unnecessary) and then finally their relationship to the dog. Pass on this movie...It seems that this movie made the majority of people feel bad after watching it. ""Old Yeller"" at least celebrated life and was life affirming, where this movie missed the mark.Personally, I think that if this movie is attempting to realistically show a family's arc within context of dog ownership then it failed terribly. Anyone who would allow a dog to be so wild will have little to no hope with their children. And what of the premise?? That having a miserable dog is ok because they were there while our lives were also miserable?"
2,Well-intended but shallow film.,"While they did all the right things technically, this movie lacked the emotional development necessary to really engage the viewer in both story lines - Marley's development and the family's.Apart from a few seconds of initial adorable puppy hooking you in cuteness, Marley is a manic, uncontrollable animal, and there is no plausible development as to why he is this way. There just isn't enough balance devoted to all the other parts of Marley to make enduring and ultimately bonding with him worthwhile.The family's character development is equally two dimensional. Wilson and Aniston did everything they way they were supposed to to recreate the character of the book, but this is a good example of a movie that should have taken some liberties.Overall, very dissatisfying movie."
1,Chick Click not Dog Click,"This movie is not about Marley; Marley is an afterthought or wallpaper that adds favor to a chick click.I thought ""Marley and Me"" would be mostly about a dog, but Jennifer Aniston makes any movie, no matter how well intentioned, into a chick click.This is a movie about getting pregnant--bomber.I'm tired of chick flicks, and lies about the how wonderful pregnant women and babies are.Pregnant women are fat and out of shape, and babies are loud, dirty and sticky. Face it; its the truth.If you love dogs you will hate this movie.....The title of the movie misrepresents the content of the movie; the title should be ""The Trapped Man and his Only Friend Marley""No More Jennifer Aniston Movies, Please."
1,Unwatchable!,"Another cookie cutter, flat, emotionless comedy by Jennifer Aniston that not even Marley the dog could save! You can only shake your head and think what are THEY thinking in releasing such a poorly written, poorly acted, and poorly directed film. We turned it off within 10 minutes. Simply awful. And Jennifer Aniston's getting a little old to be playing the same part over and over and over again, similar to Meg Ryan whose all but disappeared from the screen (sadly). Jennifer Aniston's unending popularity remains a mystery."
1,John Grogan's... Marley.,"John Grogan's book, ""Marley & Me"" was one of the most enjoyable books I have ever read! I laughed until my stomach hurt. He did a wonderful job depicting his life with his wife and his beloved dog, Marley. However, as much as I did enjoy the movie, I felt the rendition could have been truer to the book."
5,Sweet story about life and family,"""Marley and Me"" is entertaining and touching. It's a really sweet story with honest glimpses of life and starting a family. Owen Wilson's and Jennifer Aniston's performances are great."
3,"warm hearted, cold nosed but overall rather bland","Why cant Jennifer Anniston get a decent bloke, she looked great in this! Hmm, the film was fine, fluffy and slightly sad in places, but I refuse to get too upset about a dog after all, and how the Grogans didnt get rid of the dog I have no idea, I liked it enough to want to read the book, however, so thats encouraging. Look, I cant even think of something funny to say or anything overly sarcastic, it is monday morning though. This is a story of a family and a dog, you know pretty much from that what you are going to get, Jen and Owen have pretty decent on screen chemistry, although now when I hear Wilson speaking, I always ""hear"" Lightning McQueen, so Im not sure if thats a good or bad thing..."
5,best movie ever!!!,"This is one of the best movies I have seen in a long time. Be sure that you have a box of tissues with you when you watch, but it is really great. A wonderful family movie, and a must see if you have ever loved a dog."
4,A fun family movie for a movie night!,The movie is a fun family type movie which keeps the kids entertained and the adults feeling giddy. Not much more that can be said. NO..its not a 5 star flick...but its fun just the same and worth renting.Enjoy!
5,GREAT MOVIE,"I got the movie because we have a yellow lab puppy, everyone said you got to see this movie. We laughed, we cried, WOW. Our dog, Daisy, is not a Marley but we enjoyed every hijinks. Good family movie."
2,A tragic tale,"When looking at the cover my first thought was that this looked like a sweet tale to share with children and it is- partially! But the movie is filled with very adult and disturbing themes that are not good for young viewers! Also upon the end of this film, almost every young child and several older ones as well, are left in tears of sadness and distress! That is not a component for a good movie in my opinion! If you are a dog lover this will distress and sadden you, if you are a small child this will bore you and break your heart and if you are a cold young adult who laughs in the face of death and thinks distructiveness is charming and amusing, then purchase this and it will be money well spent!"
4,MARLY AND ME,IT'S A GREAT MOVIE AND I HAVE WATCHED IT A FEW TIMES. IT CAME TO MY HOUSE QUICKLY AND WAS IN GREAT CONDITION.
3,A worthy addition.,"Nas, for many years now, has proclaimed himself as the ""King of New York"", and he is. This DVD release doesn't do him justice. Before we jump the gun here, the DVD is not terrible by any means, it just simply could have been better. Something along the lines of Killah Priest's ""A Day in the Life"" (also available here at Amazon.com), would have made the purchase more worthwhile.If you enjoy Nas' rap videos, and that's about it, this would be an excellent addition to your hip-hop collection. If you're looking for something a little more, or if you look at yourself as a more hardcore Nas fan, don't expect this to be the best thing since sliced bread."
4,Mostly all of his videos are on this DVD,This was a good DVD but i think there should have been an autobiography of Nas. I did enjoy the videos though. I think the only video that's not on here is Street Dreams remix w/ R. Kelly. There's also an option to listen to Nas tell the concept of each video. It's worth buying.
3,Easy to understand and use,"This little book is informative, easy to understand and use. I used it to create some paper mask for a project with some children, who found the whole experience delightful."
4,"Simple, solid, did the job","My small (20'x26')lakeside cottage sits on clay, consequently, it has settled over time but not evenly. The back side of the cottage needed to be raised to level it with the rest of the building. I used four of these jack screws, one for each piling and leveled the cottage with absolutely no trouble."
2,Not that great,"These screw jacks are heavy compared to Simplex brand screw jacks. If you are working in a crawl space a few pounds can mean a lot. The jacks were made in China. I found a set of 12 ton screw jacks made by Simplex which were lighter, easier to use and US made. The price was comparable if not cheaper. At the time, the Simplex jacks were not sold by Amazon.com. If you need screw jacks and can't find used ones then I would perform an internet search and find the Simplex jacks."
1,OMG! This sucks!,"for the cost of this walkie talkie seriously just go out and buy a real walkie set for about the same price. Your child will be so much happier with a toy that actually works. It's just that old 80's technology it works ""ONLY"" if the other person is standing right next to you."
4,good book,"Easy to understand directions for making many useful items. This book is for those who wish to learn skills for living off the land. Some of the subjects are stone age but if you do not want to be independent from modern conveniences or simply do not have the financial means to buy them, it is right up your alley."
3,Good but...,"Although this cd features the great Klemperer and Ferrier, it suffers from the most terrible sound imaginable!Decca screwed up on the restoring of this cd because they left all the hiss and made the sound and volume very low and unclear.Not only that but the full price cd is only 40 some minutes!It's disappointing, but nevertheless it is an important document to the discography, and more the worthwhile if you have a system with an equalizer to fiddle around with the settings."
4,"Social revolution/evolution - chartists, radicals, criminals ...","A niche analysis of crime and radicalism in the south and southwest of England in the 18th and 19th centuries. Corrects a number of misconceptions as to sentencing and the extent of capital punishment. Aspects of Chartism and the poor laws are well covered and there are fine case studies on sheep stealing, a Cornish radical and a `crime-wave' in the town of Burwash. The coverage of the Swing riots is disappointing - the book makes many references to Swing, but I came away with no greater understanding of this subject. An interesting read for Australians (and others) to provide context to the convict transportation over that same period."
5,great original country/bluegrass music,"Highly recommended. Excellent tunes and musicianship. This was my first time listing to Claire Lynch's music and it's hard to keep the music out of your head. Favorite songs: If Wishes Were Horses, I'm Going Up, Hitchcock Railway. I'm hoping to see her live next year at the Quick Center in Connecticut."
3,Not their best but far from bad.,"If you like their first 2 cds, then you like this one too. Its not as hard and diverse as the s/t cd but is definitely worth a shot. Its great to see that DT was able survive during the grunge era and produce great albums. This cd was recently digitally remastered. Make sure to get this copy!"
4,I'de Be Pissed Too,"This was the last great DT album, and even today I still can't believe no one really took these guys seriously...or even seem to acknowlege they even existed.Simply put, you would have to like to have a good time and not be embarassed to rock out, enjoy anthems, solo's, and some sleaze along with some thinly layered social commentary that doesn't go overboard to enjoy DT, it was gritty and very southern influenced hard rock that stood the test of time over all those late 80's hair bands that were too little too late, it must have been really stale for so many great bands like this to be overlooked at the time.Pissed because of being dissed by the masses on the Paintrain of today's hard rock. The Law is mine and there's no School for me, I'm a Loser who was Promised the Moon. Ain't it strange how these guys got overlooked, they are the Hard Luck Champions of rock and roll...Oh, Well, so What. They always leave me Screamin For More of the Illustrated Man."
3,Good price - Quiet - Seems a little weak,"I bought this pump as a direct replacement for a 20 year-old Sears Craftsman unit. Installation was easy, and it works fine.Unfortunately, my water pressure seems to be a little weak now. I would advise the purchase of a different unit."
1,This book is ghastly.,This book is ghastly. I gave it NO stars. We'll see if that flies. The book has weird religious overtones that you'd never suspect from the title and so many editorial errors it's hard to imagine how it ever made it to print. It is simply ghastly. Just horrible. I have resold it as Used and actually feel a little guilty for doing so. Like I intentionally and knowingly passed on an upper respiratory virus. Not a good book at all.
1,Didn't work with the os,I just didn't have luck using this book. Things it claimed worked didn't. Maybe they need to write an updated version. It became annoying and made me give up on Linux all together.
3,Very basic,"To be fair - I was looking for a book that would help to help make the transition to Linux (Ubuntu in particular) from Windows, aimed at someone who is a ""advanced user"" in the realm of the Windows based OS. So with that expectation, I found this book to be to ""basic"". For example - I wanted more information on SAMBA (there is almost none) and scripting. There is very little done in this book that utilizes a terminal window - that alone sets the tone for the book.However, as a book ""for the masses"" - to allow someone to set up and run Ubuntu as a stand alone computer connected to the internet (no LAN) - it hits the mark. Based on that criteria, I would give it 4 stars."
3,Not a Book Designed for Problem Solving,"If you are looking for a light-weight introduction to this fine operating system release, go for it. If, however, your needs go beyond ""Space does not allow us to go into any detail..."" or ""Visit www.xxxx.com for more information"" this book will disappoint you. You will also find discrepancies between the text and what you will experience using Ubuntu. This can be confusing and frustrating for a new user. For an experienced user just wanting a reference, this book is more than adequate.It is well-written and easy to understand, but it leaves unanswered many questions you might be asking if you are moving from Windows to Linux and this is your first attempt.If that is the case, I would recommend ""Ubuntu Unleashed"" from Sams Publishing, also available from Amazon.com. It is far more comprehensive, not so much in scope, but in depth. It is a little more expensive than ""The Official Ubuntu Book"" but well worth the difference in price."
5,finally a book that stresses imagination!!!,"Just wanted to let you know how much my daughter, Sophie, loves your books! We have the ""Sting"" and ""funky towl"" books and have to read both of them before nap and bed. They are the first books that she has requested to read again:)I love your company's message! After being a teacher (8th grade), it saddens me how many kids don't read, or have a non-existing imagination!I am so happy to support a local artist in this cause! Thanks for delivering it in such an enjoyable manner!Keep on writing!Thanks!"
5,Creative Kids!!!,This book is just wonderful. I love the fact that it takes a different approach and challenges the child to be creative. My niece enjoys all of the beautiful renderings and really has a lot of fun with this book. I highly recommend it.
5,The only type of kickstand to use,"I've actually purchased two of these both to put on several touring bicycles. They work great easily supporting loaded touring cycles and are back out of the way. I did have a little trouble getting this on the oversized backstay of a Cannondale because of the screw length. It would have helped if the screws were only 1/8 inch longer. Otherwise, they are fine for steel frame bicycles. The actual support length is perfect for 700c wheels. Those of you concerned about looks or weight, think ""function is beauty"" and you're protecting the finish on your expensive bicycle ... which in turn protects its value, by not having to lean the cycle against something or lay it down. And personally I like this mounting a lot better than the kickstands that mount near the bottom bracket ... near all those cables. This also seems to hold the bike more upright."
3,Rear mount kickstand,"The fit wasn't as universal as we needed. It did not fit the frame of my Iron Horse bicycle and it didn't clear the rear disk brake either. The mechanism is good though and after some modifications, we were able to get it work by building our own bracket."
4,great product but won't fit every bike...,"bought two, slapped one on old stumpjumper and it was easy ( in spite of minimal directions) and worked great - solid and sturdy. However, the stand could not be installed on a trek 7000 becasue the frame tubes are too thick and the angles to steep."
4,Good Bikestand,This is a decent bike stand for the money. I own a TREK bike and could not use a normal kickstand. This one works well on it and is as easy as a standard stand on putting it down. The only complaint I have is it came with inadequate instructions for putting it on.
2,Foot catches when pedaling.,"First I want to point out that this kickstand is of very good quality and performs the job of keeping your bike up wonderfully. The problem is that when mounted on my Specialized Sirrus bike, the heal of my left foot hit the kickstand when riding. It was simply to close to the pedals and stuck out to far out to the left. As much as I thought as this kickstand was the best I have seen so far, it was simply unacceptable for riding, and had to be removed from the bike."
5,Sturdy Kickstand,"I just received the kickstand and I was surprised to feel the weight of it. It is strong steel. I installed in less than five minutes, fits like a glove and it looks great on my bike. By the way, my bike is a 26"" Men's Mongoose XR-Comp Dual-Suspension Bike with front and rear disk breaks. This is a bike that does not normally have a kickstand but I needed one and it is great! By the way, the order came when it said it was going to arrive. Overll I'm happy."
3,Rear Kickstand,"Instructions would be nice...but this is actually pretty easy to install. I just looked at the pic online and it was obvious how it was supposed to go. The only problem is, it doesn't quite fit my '09 Trek Women's Hybrid 7200. I have it on there now minus one screw...which makes it not quite as secure as it should be. It still will hold up the bike fine (it feels very solid and still quite strong), but I won't depend on it at all to help support my son in his baby seat (I would never have used it alone to hold him up, with all the screws in it or not-I was just hoping it could help me by taking some of the weight as I put him in/out, while I still had a secure grip).I will probably keep this to keep my bike up anyway (my bike did not have a kickstand at all). I like the rear design and it's very out of the way. Just wished it fit by bike right-the tubes are just too thick."
5,Thanks--your photos helped us decide and install!,"Like some other riders/reviewers, my husband and I were frustrated after purchasing $750 bikes that did not have kickstands installed or even a space on the frame for an optional kickstand at a later date. This Greenfield kickstand with rubber foot is very strong and durable and holds the bikes up with no problem. There are multiple screws, however, which should be retightened from time to time due to vibrations and use.By the way, thanks so much, LuweGeeeeeee, for your excellent product shots/installation photos! Our Specialized mountain bikes with unusual frames were hard to fit for a kickstand. Thanks to your photos, we were able to choose this kickstand as the most likely for a successful installation. When the product arrived, there were only written instructions, no drawings or photos, so your photos really helped. Again, thanks!"
4,No instructions,"The kickstand itself is solid, but I think it's ridiculous that it didn't come with installation instructions, especially for a relatively expensive kickstand as this. Even the picture shown here on Amazon would've helped! Other than that, I don't have any complaints."
2,Junkie,"Definitely not a high quality kickstand. I tightened the first one I got too much and it snapped, and the screws strip easily. Also it doesn't feel secure and the screws come loose often, sometimes falling out. But I suppose it does work, at least for a while..."
3,Ok but not needed,"I was recommended I get this kickstand by the people at Niagara cycle. Originally I was going to purchase one half the price, but the guy I talked to at Niagara sweared by this product. The kickstand has performed well, installation was fair but not without tinkering. Opening and closing the stand is effortless. The kickstand works and is pretty stable on most surfaces. Except it's completely unnecessary. The size and stability are overkill, and I could have easily saved money by going with a cheaper Schwinn Adjustable Kickstand which is a solid product. Why pay double for this?Save money, and time by getting a regular kickstand that mounts on the bottom plate of your bike!"
1,Kickstand Broke,"Kickstand took 3 times longer to install than the disc brake compatible model made by a different manufacturer but sold by the same vendor. Screws were small and stripped more easily than the higher quality ones with the other model, which was a little less than twice as expensive. After securing the kickstand in place on my son's 20"" mountain bike, I sat on the bike and leaned on the kickstand to make sure it was secure. I weigh less than 195 lb and have done this on our other 7 bikes with various models of kickstands with no problem. In this case however the piece of pot metal that comprised the primary portion of the kickstand snapped in two. 30 minutes + $12 down the drain!"
3,Just What I expected,I preferred the Sandal that tied around the leg. The shoe is a little narrow around my toe box area but that's common for me anyway. Wore them to work and everyone wants them but I won't tell for my individually.
2,Disappointed,"The product did not have a enough description and it's not what I expected. Can fit into purse...should have thought about that one...The face is 5"" in diameter. The arms are 2"" in length. The hanger is Velcro so it can be attached to car-seat etc. The exposed mirror is about the size of a quarter. The end pieces are 1 1/2 to 2"" and a good size for baby's hands. Hearts and stars are rattles. Circles are soft fabric teether and triangle is crinkle paper. The mouth is a loose coil of fabric to use for grasping. The nose is a squeaker and that is my child's favorite part of the whole thing.It's not a bad toy, just not what I was looking for."
2,Try before you buy it.,"I like this toy but my baby show no interest, and I don't know why. Before you buy it, see if your baby likes it or not."
2,7 Legged Spider,"My baby plays with this and it will keep her quiet for a while, so in that respect, it's not bad. However, I think it is silly that it only has 7 legs. What's wrong with adding an 8th leg so that it's at least symmetrical? What is the significance of only having 7 ribbons dangling? If it's not supposed to be a spider, that's fine.....but why does it have a face and legs like a spider? I also think the crinkly triangle is a joke because it barely even crinkles. This toy doesn't make sense to me...lucky for me I didn't spend any money on it."
1,Contains Lead and Bromine,"I'm so bummed because my infant loves this toy, and I lost it. I went to purchase it for him again, and somewhere along the way was directed to a great website that tests products for contaminants. I looked up this product, and found out the red nose contains lead and bromine. The nose is what my son sucked on the most. I rated everything a 5-star because it is fun, education, etc., but the fact that pieces of the product contain carginogens and lead made me rate is overall a 1, and I will not be purchasing this product. Manhattan Toy, PLEASE clean up your product. Here's the website, and just enter the manufacture name when you search for items. [...]"
5,My baby lioves this,"Baby is four months old now and can't seem to get enough of this little toy, which I've hung over his bassinet (which is the kind that is part of a play yard). He ""eats"" it, fights with it, generally engages with it. And I think this will be the case for a long while to come . . . Furthermore, I washed it first thing, delicate cycle, which I try to do with everything for him. -- And it held up perfectly."
5,Baby's Favorite Toy,"This has been our 3-month old baby's favorite toy since he was born. It hangs on the bar of his bouncy chair along with a few other toys and it's always the first one he grabs. For the first few months of his life he loved to stare at the black and white side. The black and white bull's-eye side of the toy is large enough that the baby was able to track it with his eyes almost from the day he was born. This was the first toy he reached for when he discovered his hands, and he loves to chew on the shapes that hang down."
1,Baby Whoozit,My child hardly ever plays with his Baby Whoozit. Your supposed to be able to play hide n' seek with the shapes and hide all the shapes inside the baby whoozit but it's very difficult for me (let alone a child) to insert the shapes into the tiny holes. I don't recommend the baby whoozit.
3,Did not live up to they hype.,"The wiggly arms are great for when a little guy is having a crying spat; the movement and the noise gets their attention so you can calm them down. Past that, this toy has barely been touched, just not a favourite in our home."
2,Didn't grab my childs attention,"I read very good reviews about the 'whoozit' but my daughter didn't like at 2.5 months and does not like it at 4.5 months also... I'm hoping she likes it at some point... its too short, so she can't ever get to it... also, the black & white side of it is already useless for her... I'm a but disappointed."
5,My 5mo. old loves her whoozie!,Awesome teether toy - my baby loves to chomp on the tentacle ends of this toy. The vivid colors entertain her curious little eyes. Highly recommend.p.s. I've thrown it in the wash (and dryer) a few times and has stood up well; just inspect for loose parts to avoid a choking hazard.
5,Best Toy for Babes,"This toy is the best! My 3 month old daughter just absolutely loves it. We hang it from her Gymboree and she spends hours just chewing on the rings and hugging it. We never leave the house without it. She also loves other side of the whoozit without the face, the multiple black and white rings really catch her attention. I plan on buying more of the whoozit line since they seem to be the only toys that really catch her interest. This will also be a shower gift staple for me."
2,poor quality,"My son loved the product, but he pulled on the pink ring, and it is ripping after a few weeks. He's only four months old. I would've expected to last longer for the price and its rave reviews."
5,Interesting story if you are familiar to area,I bought this book because my mother actually knew the young police officer that was killed. I found it interesting - a little piece of history that relates to me in a more personal way. May not appeal to everyone but it is an easy to read book even if you have no connection to the events detailed. There are pictures throughout the book which helps it come to life - putting faces to the men involved.
5,Rockies by Rail: My Mom loves it!,"I gave my 91 year old Mom the Rockies by Rail video. She loves it and says she can't get enough! She has always loved Colorado, but can only do armchair travelling now. She has watched it lots of times."
5,Cuisine Economique,Book arrived in appropriate time. The condition was excellent and as described. This has been well used already with some great recipes. Thanks.
1,Shit,"I got this cd cause somebody said it was tight, this cd sounds like shiiiit, these hoes cannot chop nuttin up it is horrible, the only reason i listen to this garbage is because the guests and cause i dropped 35 dollars on this, do not but it for the sake of dj screw, its disrepectful"
4,GREAT XMAS COCKTAIL!!!,"'Santa's Bag: All-Star Jazz christmas' is on top of my list as an favorite Xmas cocktail party CD. Hearing Bobby Short singing White Christmas, as well as Jazz all time Great; George Shearing playing 'Away in a Manger' is a real delight.. My favorite has to be Jeanie Bryson's sensual rendition of 'Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas' At this price it is a steal, play it at that afternoon December cocktail party, and enjoy!"
2,dissapointment,"Wanted the classic ""Santa Claus is Coming to Town"" by the Dave Brubeck Trio and got another version. The rest of the album is mediocre."
2,"Not too bright, to my surprise","I usually enjoy Roger Ebert's movie reviews, but quite a few reviews in this book evidenced what can only be called stupidity. Although he understands the basic necessities of movie entertainment (dramatic tension, forward movement, character development etc.), so does every college drama graduate. The problem is that Ebert enjoys an amazing blindness to complex emotions and irony, and his sense of humor is decidedly slapstick. Basically, he reviews movies on the mid-level-college-freshman-with-a-110-IQ level. If you share these characteristics and preferences, his opinions may appeal to you. If not, the book is just another proof that ""there's no accounting for taste."""
1,Roger Ebert is the most stupid critic of all time.,Please do not write things you don't know about. This guy knows very little about movies and pretend to be an expert. Too much nonsense in the book! The way he see movies is just like the way a child see. Don't waste your money on this crap!
5,Celtic Women,I enjoy this cd very much and often take it in the car for those boring commutes. The music is a nice mix the the voives beautiful!
4,Meav's Magic,"Meav's solo performance of material taken from Celtic Woman, where she is an intrical part of a whole, plus some of her own choice in music are only a little less than thegroup efforts of Celtic Woman. Although Celtic Woman was not meant to be a group as such,it is the group efforts that seem more magical. Celtic Woman is a must see show. Meav's choices are of the same cloth as Celtic Woman, and hold up on their own."
5,My daughter and I spent hours with this book,"My daughter loved this book when she was an infant. The ability to engage in simple manipulation of tabs and view opposites such as small and large, open and closed, short and long and up and down kept her busy for some time. I would show it to her and let her move the tab, occasionally helping her when it would get stuck. The changes in the images would keep her attention and she would have to move the tab several times so that she could see the changes repeated. I strongly recommend this book for infants approximately two years of age."
1,"Extremely condescending, puerile, and NOT FUNNY","I expected to gain some fresh insight into commonmathematical errors. Instead, I was subjected toextremely mundane mathematical issues that do notat all jibe with my own observations as an instructor.Further, the author is very condescending, giving theimpression he imagines everyone a fool save hisinsightful self. And I don't object to sharp wit inscientific writings. The problem is that Cipra is apompous bore who does not have any sense for the subtletiesof savvy humor. He comes off instead as a grumpy nerdwho desperately, flailingly strives to be viewed as ahawk-eyed comedian who just happens to know some mathematics.This book is a flop in every way. HIGHLY UNRECOMMENDED.Don't even waste your 6 bucks."
3,Not a pinyin dictionary. Need I say more?,"This may be of use to Chinese speakers from Taiwan who are translating into English. However, for native speakers of English who translate Chinese into English, or for students who need to look-up using pinyin, this dictionary will be of limited value. There is a pinyin index but it is not as convenient as a fully pinyin dictionary. Furthermore, although head character entries have pinyin readings, character compounds listed as sub-entries under each head character lack pinyin readings. It is more comprehensive than Oxford's Chinese-English English-Chinese (ISBN 0195911512) but I only use it rarely for characters I can't find in Oxford."
2,Where's the picture?,I've been looking for a English-Chinese Dictionary but haven't been able to do so because I don't even know if it's in Traditional or Simplified Chinese. I don't really understand Chinese in the Simplified form. It would be nice if there's a picture of the dictionary placed online so I can have a better idea of what I'm buying. I would also like the publisher to specify whether it's Traditional or Simplified Chinese.
4,Taiwan focus!,"Just keep in mind that this dictionary was written in Taiwan and that not all entries are for Mainland Chinese. There is more at stake here than the difference between simplified and traditional characters. I studied out of this dictionary for years and found myself not understood in Beijing (at times).The best part about this dictionary is a particular edition that highlights in red those entries that are most common. Found that particular edition very helpful. Don't know if that is the offering here. But keep on the look out for the ""highlighted"" edition, as well."
5,This is the famous Liang Shih-ch'iu dictionary.,"The late Liang Shih-ch'iu (Liang Shi-qiu) was the original editor-in-chief of this superb dictionary. He was an amazingly learned scholar of Chinese language and civilization. The dictionary used to be known as the ""Liang Shih-chiu dictionary,"" and it remains among the most useful Chinese-English sources. For serious students of the Chinese language, it is indispensible."
5,Best wrist support ever!,"I got my first Compusooth about 6 years ago. I am into video editing and other very long processes.This is outstanding for long hours of computer work. If your wrists ever get swollen or sore and you cannot stop, just put this baby in the freezer for 20-30 minutes and bingo! If you are hot, wrap it around your neck, if you have a headache or need to fall sleep on your desk. These guys also make a pillow cover that keeps your head cool for hours!! Do not use a blade to open the box when you receive it, you can cut into it."
4,"surprisingly strong, but cannot stand up to parrots","I purchased a bunch of these suckers to hang toys and lift nets in the bird room. Everything went well for a while - I was amazed at how strong they were, and how well they were holding up...until my conures started to nibble on the rubber. I yell and that makes them want to do it even more, and the sun conures also investigate. I had at least 1/2 of the suckers fall after the birds would bite away the suction. ..it only takes a little bite to break the seal. These are very hand and useful - just keep them away from parrots!"
1,poor product! poor shipping from co.,"can't use item ordered! took long time to receive item!would not recommend company that item came from or the item!!!item poor and weak, don't know what it's use would be for! avoid."
2,They don't stick,I bought these hooks to hang up my daughters mesh baby tub in the shower. They held for a couple days but after that i would find the tub on the floor. I gave up on hanging it up after a week and just left the cups up. A couple days after that i got into my shower and stepped directly on the metal hook part of the cup- it had fallen off with no weight on it and punctured my foot. I would definitely not buy again.
4,a bright round.,"itworks wonderfully and springs back into shape after it is cleaned, It is easy to use and now I want a whole set."
4,"If you like it, you'll like it","A lot has been said in the other reviews, but I'll speak to what I thought the great strength of the film was. This film shows both a more realistic view of campaigning then you are likely to get anywhere else (it is brutal) and it also shows that politicians are human. I saw the film and have recommended it to others, but if you have no interest in politics, I'm not sure what you'll get out of it. I really just enjoyed the political humanism."
4,Nice battery pack for price,"AGAIN & AGAIN HR72-KIT 7.2 Volt Nitro NiCd Battery/Charger Kit... I purchased this battery pack after the original type would no longer hold a charge and and were costing more from Sears. It's being used in a Sears RC 65 Mustang that was purchased 20 yrs ago. My grandson is now the owner of his first Mustang. This replacement battery charges just as quick and seems to hold it's charge as long or better than the original packs and was purchased at a lot lower price. Granted this is being used in a kids toy running around the great room floor or on the driveway. Not sure it would hold up for those that are into serious RC racing, as with anything it depends on what your needs are.AGAIN & AGAIN HR72-KIT 7.2 Volt Nitro NiCd Battery/Charger Kit"
2,What a disappointment!,"I loved Mr. Harris's prior discs. I bought this one and it has just enough decent songs to keep as opposed to dumping for $4-5. It is not predominantly blues, therefore if you are a traditional blues fan and looking for more his fine work in that genre, approach this with caution. Just because it is not blues does not make it bad. The crux of the problem is that the non-blues songs presented here are just crummy music! Corey is an extremely talented person. Let's hope that he gets back to doing what he does best. P.S. The artwork on the disc is bad."
2,I tried to like it,"He seems like a good guy, it's the rootsy kind of thing I usually dig, I just didn't like it. I think some of it was supposed to be hokey/charming but it stuck me as hokey/dumb.I'm glad so many people loved it; I must be missing something. If Taj Mahal or John Hammond are your idea of cool, rootsy blues, then beware."
5,Seven Steps,I have completely enjoyed listening to this recording by Ray Brown: 7 STEPS TO HEAVEN. I had had the opportunity to see Mr. Brown several times many years ago and it was very educational as well as entertaining to hear the different Trio combinations that were with him.
3,Industrial rap,"If you like rap and you also like industrial, there's a pretty good chance you'll like SMP's Terminal. Unfortunately, I'm not a big fan of rap, so this album just doesn't do it for me.The rapping is competent, and not annoying in the high-pitched whingeing manner artists like Eminem have. The voice is very white boy, but it's angry white boy, which suits the aggro music quite well.Still, I think it's rather telling that ""Militia Love"", perhaps the one track with the least amount of rapping, has been SMP's contribution to various samplers. Its emphasis seems more on the refrain than on quickly-chanted lyrics."
1,Caution: Won't Work With Nikon SB-900 !,"Omega Satter Flash Frame FF-400 FlashFlip HOT Hands on Top Camera and Flash Bracket - Omega Flash BracketsMost certainly not worth the money. This is for small speed-lights and regardless of what they say, it won't work off-camera with the Nikon SC-28. The receiver is too small for either the SB-900 or the SC-28.It is lightweight and the fold-over won't support a speedlight like the SB-900, if you could attach it which you can't.Most certainly not worth the money. I'm shipping it to a friend as a gift - the have a Canon speedlight that will fit it."
3,Zen Stone Plus 2,The Zen Stone Plus 2 is easy to load and edit playlists but the battery life is terrible! It doesn't makes it through two 90 minute workouts.
1,Creatively defective,"Was enjoying my first MP3 purchase when lo and behold, it stopped working just as other reviewers have told. Didn't think it'd happen to me but it did. Not only did it last just three weeks, but I scored it low because of the lack of personal technical support (no phone number listed on the web site); the lack of any paper manual (am I old-fashioned?), and the difficulty of operating the device. I'd recommend not getting ""Creative."""
2,Screen too small,"I had to buy this MP3 player, in order to download text through the public library system in my hometown, as their system is not compatible with an Ipod.I much prefer the Ipod.The screen is very small; hard to read.This unit is hard to turn on; have to hold button for 5 seconds.It is reported to play for 10 hours; I am lucky if mine works for 2.The rewind goes to the complete beginning of the whole book not the section.Cost was about 80 dollars, a lot less than an Ipod, and you get what you pay for; I don't recommend it"
4,Amazing little device,"Impressive in size, it takes a bit to get used to the functions, but very limited batterywise. Nevertheles I purchased the other the 1 GB version as well."
2,1 gb Stone is better,"I think the 1 gb Stones are actually easier to use, and you don't have to look at them. The display makes a big reduction in battery life."
4,Great product!,"Really quite a good product. I wanted a small mp3 player to run with, listen to between classes, etc, and this is great! It would probably be easier to use if I had read the instruction manual first, but really it's fairly simple to operate and load music onto! Plus, 2G holds a lot more songs than I had orginally thought. I also own a creative zen vision w, which has a fairly large screen (I use it to watch movies during long car and bus trips with my college marching band), and both products have been great!"
5,Excellent!,"Great book with a great selection of trails, some only a few miles away from me that I was unaware of.The book is set up so that it is very easy to plan each trip. The descriptions of the flora and fauna to be encountered on the trail are very detailed. As a budding nature photographer, this is a major plus.Love the book and recommended to anyone who lives in or is planning a vacation to Connecticut who wants to see the variety of landscapes and wildlife that the state has to offer."
5,"Great access, beautiful walks","I was pleased to find this guide to discovering the natural areas of Connecticut. Since I bought it, my family and I have been on numerous hikes. The chart in the front helps us plan--if we have time for a bit of a drive and a day's outing, we can go farther to a new and spectacular hike. If we don't have much time, we choose one closer to home. It's a great way to explore our new home state."
3,Excellent value,"Exactly what I wanted. Great price, and works perfectly. Arrived on time and in excellent condition."
5,goood,i liked the product and it was reliable source too although it took quiet long to reach me and i gave it to my boyfrend long after his birthday
1,would never buy olympus again!,"First of all Amazon asked me to write a review of a product that THEY think I bought but I didnt. I purchased (or thought I was buying) a 512 MB card and when I got it it was an M512MB card so right off the bat Amazon had it wrongly labeled on their site! THen I found out that the Olympus Stylus410 camera I had wouldnt take the M or H card. In fact it was the ONLY camera in the olympus line that Olympus never upgraded! I even called Olympus customer ""nonservice"" ""nonsatisfaction"" line and they were NOT NICE! They said in fact you are ""SOL"" but I wont type that out yet. Didnt even give me an incentive to buy a new camera. So what did I do? I bought a CANON!If you are buying one of these card- check with the owner to make sure that WHAT YOU SEE IS WHAT YOU GET. Because it wasnt with my purchase"
1,Did not get what I ordered!!,Please beware. Even though the picture says Ceylon Cinnamon that is not what you get. It arrived as Cassia which is not the same thing. I will be returning it!
1,Poor Quality!,"I am returning my bag. The actual zippers that you pull are made out of cheap, thin plastic and as I grabbed one to open, it snapped in half- followed by a second zipper. Another example of profit trumping good workmanship and quality products. Don't buy this bag."
1,basic electronics math mistakes,subtract a star or two if you don't all ready understand complex algebra and want to correct wrong answers and examples.there are so many mistakes and wrong answers in this book it is confusing . I wrote the pub. but got no reply. My best advice is don't waste your time or money on this book
2,Solid but not at all near his best work,"The energy long associated with Brubeck has drifted. The numbers are serviceable, but I would not choose this cd if I wanted to expose a new listener to this important figure in jazz lore."
2,Good if you don't know any trans people...,"I read this book about 8 years ago, when I was starting my transition and reading everything I possibly could find. I was so excited to find this on a trip to NYC. It's fine - nothing horrible, but the writing is awkward and the author or his co-writer mention dozens and dozens of times how incredibly attractive he had been as a woman. Which is fine and all, but really, it just seemed narcissistic after the first 3 or 4. Outside of that, very textbook tranny case, not a ton of insight or reflection, I only finished it out of loyalty and then gave it away. Not awful, but I wouldn't recommend it unless you know NOTHING about ftms and want the safest, most uncomplicated bio possible."
5,A real page turner!,"I have read a lot of Vampire books...Anne Rice, etc. This book was one of those novels that I literaly could not put down and had to keep reading until it was finished. I admit I might be partial to it becasue I have spent a great deal of time in Memphis and could relate to the neighborhoods, etc., but Beecher Smith also did a wonderful job of drawing me into the characters and making me have to know what happened to them. I hope he is writing a sequel! Get this one today!"
1,found below standards,not good. i found out at it's first cat show that the plastic that the top snaps into place was broken in 2 places. 1 part snaps the other place won't. the cat got out because i thaught it was secure and it wasn't. that cat is worth $1300. and i expect it to grand with it's family tree.
2,kennel,"this kennel is definitly for extra small dogs i have a chiuiuia and its way to small for her,its working good for my ferret though"
3,contact me,I order a blue one and the top is messed up no one has contacted me about I AM very upset with it
2,Regret it.,This cat carrier looks cute but falls apart easily. I can pick it up a little rough or jiggle the door slightly and the door will fall off. The whole thing came apart when getting it out of a tight space. It will work just isn't very safe.
4,"Fantastic, inexpensive, and it works!","My new puppy (now a dog) loves it, even likes to sleep in it after he has been at the vet or the beauty shop for the day, works well, and I have had no problem keeping it together, like some of the reviews I read."
4,Pretty Good,"This is a very sturdy kennel. It was a bit smaller than I thought it was going to be, however it does the trick for small cats. I would recommend this for kittens and small cats under the age of 2/3 yrs old."
1,"Really, really flimsy.","I was moving five animals and bought five of these kennels because they were designed to assemble and disassemble easily (or so I thought) for storage and were priced so cheaply. On Amazon sometimes cheap isn't a band thing - but this time it was. One of the kennels arrived broken, so now I've got the hassle of returning this stupid thing, and I was also short a kennel and had to improvise with a live trap. And the other four I felt it necessary to duck tape them for safety. I wrapped duck tape all the way around the kennel to hold the snap down handles in place. Years ago I bought one of these snap apart kennels, and it was sturdy and easy to assemble and disassemble and store. This is the same maker but they have significantly cheapened the design. Unless you don't mind having a duck taped kennel, I would save your money and buy something different."
1,Cheap and DANGEROUS,"I have used this carrier twice, and BOTH times I used it the top came apart from the bottom and the cat escaped. This is a very thin plastic and any pressure at all on the sides will release all the clamps that hold the top and bottom together... if you buy this you MUST put zip ties on all the sides to hold the top and bottom together! I own several other carriers of this same brand (purchased previously) that have never come apart like this :-("
3,WARNING - not for the size and weight recommended!!!,"If I had bought this for the size of pet they recommend, I would have returned this item. It is definitely not worth the original $40 price. The plastic is of thin quality and the food and water dish included is ridiculously small. Also, the door rattles horribly in the car!! THAT BEING SAID, I did buy this for my little Chihuahua, who is only 3lbs but a little too tall for a small sized kennel, and this kennel works perfectly for him. If he were any heavier the handle would come off and the bottom would sag - but since he's tiny this kennel is perfect for him, I would def recommend this item to anyone needing a taller kennel for a tiny dog with longer legs. But NOT for any pet over 5lbs!!!"
1,This item will fail.,"We recently purchased this item from a retail pet supply store, hoping to bring home a cat adopted from our city shelter. Upon returning to our home and taking the carrier out of the car, the plastic latches holding the entire kennel together FAILED. Our new cat fell out when the bottom of the kennel hit the ground and he promptly ran away down the street, never to be seen again.Don't waste your time and money with any kennel that uses plastic latches to hold the top and bottom halves together. Stick with kennels that use screw assembly, they can withstand almost anything. This was a hard learned lesson for our entire family."
1,dangerous kennel,"I got this kennel to use when picking up my rescued bichon in another state. It was a good size and easy to assemble although made of flimsy plastic. The first time I used it with her, some of the clips came apart and the door would not stay latched. Scary for a dog that's not used to being carried and is afraid of noise. No matter what I do, the door still won't stay shut, but swings open. Thankfully Scarlett has not fallen out, but I'm afraid to use the kennel now. She's 20#, so within the recommended size range. I'm very disappointed in this product."
3,ok but could be better quality,I bought this for my 12 pound cat. While he has plenty of room in there the clasps holding the top & bottom together could be better. They held but I was nervous carrying him into the vet. Next time I use it I'm planning on using a bungee around it.
2,other brands are better,"I've used the 'Pet Taxi' brand in the past and they are much better built than this one. This one is rather flimsy and the 'treat container' on the top is nearly impossible to get open and is not even deep enough for a deck of cards. It will work for short trips like vet visits, but is not very good for a night time bed."
5,"Great crate, and pink!!","I bought this crate for my 7 pound tiny cat after purchasing and returning a pink one that was not all that sturdy looking (it was held together by crappy little plastic pins and came with no instructions). This one is far superior, and the same price. I got this for $20 at Walmart. I LOVE the pink! So cute! My kitty went right in, and while I thought it looked small, there was plenty of room for her inside. My big full size cat also checked it out, but she was kind of pushing it on the size scale. I am going to use this for short car trips and it will do perfectly fine. Great carrier!"
2,crate,I bought this for my dog however when it came didn't realize the size was wrong. It was too small. I would have kept it if my dog were smaller. It was nicely built and came with a little water dish even.
5,Petmate Kennel Cab is very nice,Item arrived in a timely manner and was as nice as it looked in the picture. Very functional. I am very happy with this purchase.
4,Petmate Kennel Cab/Medium/Blue,"I bought this to transport a couple of cats so they wouldn't rip up my car. I looked at a few different carriers before deciding on this one. Based on the reviews and the price I figured I would try it (knowing I could return it if it wasn't right). For some reason I thought it would be bigger than it actually is. When I first got it and put it together I wasn't sure if it would be big enough, or strong enough, to fit both cats. However after trying it out, it works great. The cats are about 20-22 pounds together and, despite my worries, the handle and clasps held up well. They don't have a lot of extra room to move around but it works fine for trips to the vet."
2,Didn't close right,"I bought this for my cat to ride back to America. We are a Military family stationed in Europe. The cage did not close all the way, like it was made wrong. I don't think all of them are made that way because I was able to use the door from our old one and now it closes fine."
1,"NOT safe, DO NOT BUY.","NOT SAFE FOR TRAVELING:I was traveling with my cat when we were hit by a drunk driver. The accident was fairly serious. This POS kennel separated top and bottom upon impact leaving my cat out in the open to run free. The latches busted completely in half. Of course, she was scared as the dickens and darted out the nearest broken window. If it wasn't for the grace of God and a wonderful volunteer firefighter we would have lost our cat for good.The carrier was properly assembled as I test my carrier for safety before each use.What the hell is the point of a cat carrier if it doesn't do its job and keep the cat safe in all types of travel situations?????If you care about your cat's safety, get a zipper carrier. The latches on this carrier just do NOT hold up."
1,Cheap Plastic,"I actually bought this at Wal-Mart for $25. The plastic is a fairly thin (for crate expectations) composite and not very sturdy. The snaps on the side wouldn't stay snapped shut. When I first put it together, the door fell out of it's holes. My cat easily wiggled the door when in the crate, and I worried he was going to bust out of the crate! I returned this crate the very same day I bought it."
2,bad construction,This was a nice color but was constructed poorly and would not stay together. Couldn't use it and had to send it back.
4,Used for years,"I no longer have this item but it served it's purpose well. Very sturdy and locks easily. A good buy, however I wouldn't keep any pet in a crate this size for more than a couple of hours...too confining."
1,"Cute, but COMPLETE GARBAGE",I purchased two of these to replace two kennels my cats had outgrown for a move coming up in FOUR DAYS. They arrived today -- BROKEN with MISSING PIECES. Someone clearly did not check the packaging before they mailed and/or they packaged poorly.Customer Service agreed to expedite two more so I can have them in time for my move on Saturday but I am afraid they will arrive broken and with missing pieces again.Yes the colors are chic (I went for the Sky Blue) but cute doesn't protect your cat if the kennel falls apart on the streets in New York in the middle of the move.I've had pets my whole life and it was a dumb decision to try to save some money and get cheap kennels. Spare yourself the drama and look at reviews -- get better kennels. Don't make the same mistake I did.
2,Dissapointed,I bought this product and am pleased with it for the most part but was dissapointed because the picture that they displayed online was not like the product I received. Most of it was the same and the kennel is in good condition so I'm pleased with that but I would have appreciated the seller being more upfront or saying that the kennel that you receive may look different than the one pictured. All of the features are the same but the one I received has different colors than the one pictured and that is what drew me into buying it the most.
5,"decent ""home away from home""","I got this crate for when my dog stays somewhere else overnight rather than wrestle with the bigger one I keep at home. She is a Jack Russell mix and is comfortable in it, and knows it is ""hers"" when she is away from home. I never carry it by the handle with her in it for fear of it falling apart (she is 26 pounds), I put it in the car and have her get in it herself. It is a nice option to have."
3,Cute But Not Economical,"This might me okay for a small kitten but my 2 lb. maltese puppy didn't have room in it. I still have it and have never used it, I guess this will be another donation!!! It is cute because of the color this is the reason I ordered it but it is just to small."
5,Purrfect Kitty Carrier,This is a well built and safe carrier for my kitty. It is very sturdy and light weight. A great product.
2,a bad brand of carrier,i brought this cage and another one and it is badly made. the side of carrier doesn't fit right the door came apart a few times. I am not happy with this product.
2,Not as good as they use to be,I needed to get another pet carrier for our newest cat who grew out of his kitten carrier. So I ordered the exact same carrier as the other two we already own. I have to say that I am disappointed with the new one. It is not as durable as the other two. My cat is 10 plus pounds and am afraid that the carrier will fall apart when I go to pick him up. The plastic is very thin and bends easily. It took a little bit for me to get all of the clips closed too. This crate will only be used for emergencies ie. when all three cats have to leave the house at the same time. Strange how items can change over time even when they are described the exact same way.
1,Handles tend to break on this namebrand,"My carrier was only 2 years old and would hold a cat that was 11 pounds. The handle broke off. In talking to my vet, he said that is quite common for this brand."
1,Both of my cats could have died because of this thing,"I used two of these pet carriers to carry my two cats home from the vet, six blocks from my apartment. Every few steps the doors would fly off altogether. Not open up, completely come off. One block before I reached my house, both carriers completely and irreperably came apart. I was absolutely terrified, and struggling in the middle of the street to somehow hold the pieces together with my hands, without doors of course, and keep my cats somehow contained within the pieces. My cats were both terrified and trying to escape. Since I had my hands full doing this, I couldn't get them to my apartment on my own, and had to pay a passerby fifteen dollars to help me carry one of them."
4,Perfect for your care bears fan!,"This twin sheet set comes with one fitted sheet, one flat sheet, and one pillowcase. It has a low thread count, but my daughter thought it was plenty soft for her. Haven't had any issues with fading."
4,Somewhat interesting,"I had to read this for a class that I had. I know it is representative of Russian literature, but it's very bleak and depressing. None of the plays have a really happy ending, but they do have good endings. My least favorite of the plays was Three Sisters, and my favorite was Cherry Orchard. Three Sisters, in my opinion is about the most bleak, unsatisfying, and depressing play about life and love I have ever read. Cherry Orchard is, in my opinion well thought out, bad things happen in this play, but there are reasons for these occurances, and it also has the most satisfying ending of all the plays in this book. Seagull, Uncle Vanya, and Ivanov aren't really bad, but aren't spectacular. If you want to read a light-hearted and easy going play, don't read this. They were interesting enough for me to give this four stars, they aren't bad for the most part, but aren't spectacular either."
3,Here is what I think,"I am getting my new lab in a couple of weeks and I am new to this breed and retrieving. I was looking for a book to tell me detailed instructions on Lab training and retrieving. This book has a lot of information and is enjoyable to read. I read it in one day. I would have liked to of had more detailed successful step by step instruction, but I found that the author knows so much that he forgets that the new guy (me) doesn't and therefore he assumes to much. Eventhough it has a lot of information and great tricks I don't feel that I have enough information so that I could train a dog to retreive."
1,Mis-information,"I picked this book up and flipped open to a page where the author discusses health problems in retrievers. He compares the relatively healthy Flat-Coated Retriever to the Labrador, which has more health problems, and states correctly that the Labs have been bred with less care and attention to health concerns. HOWEVER, he states that the Labs and Flat-Coats are essentially the same dog except for the length of coat. This is absolutely not true. Although they originated similarly, both have been bred separately with the introduction of diverse breeds into their backgrounds. If the author has not bothered to research this, and makes incorrect statements based on his lack of research, how can I trust any information contained in the book?"
2,Training with hand signals,"I bought this book in anticipating that it would inform me on what was the standard hand signals used for training pups to sit, stay, come, etc.. as it stated on the back cover of the book. After reading the whole book, I asked myself where did I read about the hand signals? I then went to the back index to check if I missed it, to my dismay, it referenced one page that had one sentence on arm waving.. and that's all. If the author had given as much discussion and illustrations on knot tying as he did on hand signals I might have thought the book had some merit. Overall the book was written choppy, and disjointed and I disliked the writer's style of first person, informal.A would suggest you to forget this book and look into buying the book ""Training Your Retriever"" by James Lamb Free."
4,Spiritual without the Baggage,"What I like about this album is that it is spiritually minded, even Christian, without being heavy handed or preachy. Most of the songs are honest cries from a seeking heart. The songs aren't sappy or melodramatic. I related to them immediately. Beware, though- if you're a normal Christian music fan, this music may not appeal to you. It seems to slip out of the confines of the genre and speak to all of us. At least, it did to me."
4,Easy Reading,"This is a well-written but easy to read book on the subject of the history of modern France. I think this would be a good supplimental work for an advanced 8th grade history course or a standand high school history course. It is, however, a little below standard fair for college students."
5,Best mile by mile stories for the John Day River,"It is a little too big to have out on the boat with you, but the wealth of stories is fun to read. It is a good book to pull out around the campfire and read tot he group to prepare them for the coming day or reflect on what they saw on the current day."
1,Nothing to be desired,It was a tale of disappoint. Jamie is very dull and underdeveloped. In the beginning he seeks revenege and believes nothing until reasured by his father figure. He comes off as very stupid and never learns from his countless mistakes. His enemies seems far smarter than he and his methods to victory are not in sync with his character. The book is dragged out and the scenes reoccur countless times. The ending was the best part. The book was over. The book is shallow and so are the heroine and hero.
5,Years of Wisdom in Short Order,"I had the opportunity to read ""Rat Race Rleaxer"" one recent Sunday afternoon and although I have found other self help books to be informative, this one seem to fit into many aspects of my life at the moment.Instead of being long and drawn out to make the author's point, ""Rat Race Relaxer"" was consise and brief. The points that the author wanted to get across were apparent and not filled with excess fluff. I was able to read its entire content in just an hour so that I could grasp its message before putting into use some, if not all of its suggestions.I now find myself remembering comments or points within the book that relate to current situations in everyday life. I will be using the author's recommendations as they apply to me. For the reader looking to gain some insight into existing within the rat race, this will do it without coming off as preaching."
3,S&W Lightning Holster Review,"First I will say that everything Bianchi makes that I have handled is of top quality both in manufacture and in materials. Having said that I found two problems. The first when I bought it I thought that designation 55L was for ""Lightnin"". When I received it I found the ""L"" was for left hand. My bad. I tried working with the holster as a left hand model and had difficulty placing the snap on while on my hip. (To reholster and secure the weapon) I believe with practice and with the correct holster most people would develop a system for efficiently snapping the holster secure.I like the look and feel of the holster and the craftmanship. I may try purchasing another in right hand to see if I can make it work for me."
2,Functional but marginal quality,"The design is a very functional secure carry for those ""hammerless"" or ""shielded"" hammer pistols. The small size and compact fit provides good concealment. Currently made in Mexico, the quality of Bianchi products has suffered significantly. The fit and finished were sub-par compared to vintage US produced Bianchi holsters. The belt loop is so tight on my holster that, it was impossible to push a 1 "" double stitched belt through. Perhaps this holster was an exception...."
1,Fit not as advertised,"I have a S&W 442 with rubber grips, and, despite the claims of the manufacturer, the gun with rubber grips simply will not fit. Further, the belt loop is so tight that, with the gun in place, I was unable to push my 1-1/4 inch belt through the loop. I have been very happy with Bianci over the years, but this experience is a dramatic exception. I am returning this product for a refund."
4,Christmas candy,"I find myself agreeing with another 4 star review about this appealing to ""jazz novices"" and about the schmaltzy violins. It's cleanly done and it's still Oscar, but...For a contrasting example of not-too-sweet, check out Duke Ellington's cover of Tchaikovsky's ""Nutcracker Suite"" on ""Three Suites"". His nicely bent version of ""Dance of the Sugarplum Fairy"" is especially good, right down to his title-change to ""Sugar Rum Cherry""."
2,"very jazzy, not overly Christmassy","I just got this a week ago, and I suspect I'll listen even when it's not Christmas. The jazzy improvisations meander away from the familiar tunes so it wouldn't be like listening to Bing sing White Christmas in July. Very hip, cool, sophisticated, classic jazz. Smooth, but not like our local ""smooth jazz"" station plays -- not that obnoxious oily kind. A highball on the rocks with a christmas napkin, not eggnog in a Santa mug with candy cane garnish."
3,There is Oscar Peterson Christmas.,It is most of Oscar Peterson accompaning others. He is not the main performer.
5,My favorite soft jazz Xmas CD,For years I've been listening to Oscar Peterson's tape of his Xmas music and now I've found it on a CD. I'm delighted to have it to savor for all the Christmases to come! the quality is exceptional and the music sets my holiday mood perfectly.Dancing Mama
5,Excellent New Disney Book,"It's evident the book is written by a true Disney fan, plus there are some great little bits of humor that make it quite entertaining. There were a few instances where I was reading a section and thought ""oh this quote from Walt would be so relevant, or this movie reference would work here nicely."" More often than not, as I read a little further, or read the little notebook quotes, it was exactly what I was thinking of. Then there are the little teasers about future projects like Rapunzel Unbraided and especially the quote from Mary-Jane Ruggels about doing an animal-caper, a mystery and Latin American based movie. I've made a point of collecting Disney books (I probably have at least half of those mentioned in the endnotes), yet this book still offered new stories and insights."
5,BEST ONE YET.,"I have all the Buddha Bar releases, but this one really strikes a chord. My favorite, especially disc 1. If you like the previous ones, pick this one up."
1,This album ...,"I really do not want to spend a lot of time reveiwing is album. It's remixed by David Visan, not Claude Challe, maybe that explains the poor song selection. I think the themes are eating and drinking and quite frankly both selections do not really put me in the mood to do either. Lots of Middle-Eastern sounds. I'd say buy a new-age CD if you are really into the whole ZEN thing, this album is a complete waist of money and I sure hope that it is the last in the Buddha-Bar series, so played out."
3,Not the best in the series,"This release does not have the same energy as the first 3. It is a good collection, but don't have the expectation that it's as great as the first ones."
2,the furminator is a lot better,"I got this before I got the furminator and even though the furminator costs more it is worth it. The blade looks the same but the angle of attack, or something, with the furminator is different and it makes a HUGE HUGE difference in the result. You get 10x, 20x, (I don't know it's huge) more with the furminator in the same amount of time. When I saw that the blades were the same I was worndering if I had wasted my money. I didn't see how there could be such a huge difference but there really is. Don't bother with this. Get the furminator."
1,It broke company says too bad,"I bought this product, and I was happy with it. Then it broke and the company said that it had a 30 day guarantee if bought from them. Otherwise bring it back where you bought it and see what they would do."
5,"Great product, highly recommended","One of the best brushes I've found for a cat or dog. It gets the mats & the undercoat out with ease. My cat hates getting groomed, he's a main coon so he needs a daily grooming. So with the ShedEnder it's a whole lot easier & faster to get him groomed before he decides that he doesn't want to anymore. I definitely recommend the ShedEnder for anyone with a cat or dog."
2,Doesn't live up to the hype,"It's not that this product doesn't remove some of the dog's fur, but it just doesn't live up to the name ""Shed Ender"". A flea comb removes almost as much fur."
2,Fancy handled fine comb,Saw this on TV and purchased online. We have a long haired cat and this is completely worhless. Get better results with a comb with steel pins spaces less than 1/16 apart. The Shed Enders teeth are too close together and too short to work on the fine hair of a long haired cat.
5,super great comb,"hi;i just love my new dog comb, it is great. now i dont have to vaccum as much since their is less hair and the dogs enjoy the attention while im grooming them.this is the best dog comb i have ever used for getting loose hair. i am going to order 2 or 3 more for my family for xmas."
4,Shed Ender and Husky,"We have bought different types of brushes for our husky and this one works well. It is a little difficult because it is small, but works!"
2,Shame on you!,"This book was a bit of a disappointment. While still entertaining, it doesn't have the cleverness of the previous books in the series, and unfortunately it leaves many major plot points unresolved. What happened to the kidnappers? Does the disappearance of the robot cause any problems on Lorelei? Does anything amusing happen in the resolution of the bet set up in the early pages of the book? Does the general carry through on his threat to set unreasonable mission objectives? We never find out.Further, the plot revolves almost entirely around the Company members-- there's very little of Phule's character in the book. Beeker is similarly absent (and is much more of a sketch than he was in previous books-- it seems his personality has been amputated).Despite these flaws, the book is entertaining, and it's a quick read. But for a fan of this series, it's a real disappointment."
2,Bad enough that I didn't finish it.,"I was 90% through this book and was slogging my way through slow, dragged out tedious writing when I realized I just didn't care enough to find out what happened at the end.As this other fellow Peter Heck collaborated on this book, I am surmising that Heck had a lot to do with it and Asprin was behind the scenes saving Heck from a disaster that would have had me laying the book aside much earlier. The book has moment of the old Phule series, but it has a great deal of flat, hackneyed prose that drains the characters of their previous vigor.Stop reading the Phule series until Asprin flies solo at the keyboard.If it still stinks, then we can wish Mr. Asprin well as he rides off into the sunset."
2,Disappointing latest to an excellent series,"I was disappointed in the latest episode of the 'Phule's Company' saga. While the first volume was both wonderful fiction and good advice on managing people, the latest fell flat.The structure of the book is lacking. The taut tension absent. The humor banal. And the insight into human nature to be expected by this writer gone.Regrettably not worth keeping now that I have it."
3,"Average Aspirin, still entertaining, but ...","one wished for the old, pre-writer's block, Robert Aspirin. Yet another variation on the Phule theme."
3,WRONG WATCH,"DID NOT KNOW THEY STILL MADE THESE, EXPECTED A BATTERY WATCH GOT A SELF WINDER THAT STOPS IF YOU DON'T USE IT EVERY DAY"
5,THE MOST BEAUTIFUL CD YOU CAN IMAGINE,"This is a CD you will listen to over and over again. It is simply beautiful! The orchestration, the beauty of Joe's unfailing and unaging voice--a fantastic CD to relax to or to put on while you're getting office/paper work done."
4,Good for ESL knowledge,This is a good book for getting background knowledge for teaching ESL or working with anyone wanting to learn English. It is pretty technical but the book is organized well and will be a good reference many times. Practice tests are included. Very complete.
4,Too bad this is out of print,"But it looks like you can find used copies that aren't too overpriced. Get one as soon as you can. It's the Cowgirls captured live in their prime. I always loved their version of ""Carbona Not Glue."" Back in the mid and late 80's it was impossible to find the original by the Ramones. I'll never forget how thrilled I was when they busted it out the first time I saw the Cowgirls.Also check out Mighty High...In Drug City."
5,LiZA at her best!,"This c.d. seems to be the most widely stocked Liza recording in every music store I'm in. There's a good reason for that. It's Liza at her best, and it doesn't get any better than that. There all here, Cabaret, New York, New York, Maybe This Time. All the big numbers associated with Liza. The Kander & Ebb medley is great, as are the added bonuses of Some People, Old Friends, and Alexander's Ragtime Band. Whether you're a new fan or and old one, every Liza fan needs this one!"
4,"Inexpensive, dependable and includes pump","I bought this bed as a literal ""quickbed"" for guests. It inflates quickly, doesn't take up much room and is actually quite comfortable. It does not come with an AC adapter, but I haven't found this to be a necessity. I also thought it inflated quickly, I'm wondering if the one reviewer who had a problem had a defective pump. For the money, I think this is a great bet and you can even reverse the direction of the pump to deflate the bed quickly!"
4,Good value overall,"I had this product shipped to my brother's house so that I could sleep on it while visiting him. It was all set up when I arrived, according to my brother the pump required 4 batteries (D) which he happened to have on hand. Good thing! I slept okay on it, though I've slept on better (more comfortable) air mattresses before. The one major negative thing (that I have experienced with other air mattresses) is that I get *cold* at night. I'm warm from the top because of the covers, but cold from below, I think because you're sleeping on air.Overall a good value."
3,Coleman Dorm Twin Quickbed,The 4D pump simply does not pump the bed up firm enough. I purchased the Coleman plug-in pump seperately (sorry if I don't have the name of that product right but it is easy to find.) I would give the mattress 5 stars if I was reviewing the external pump with the bed. Now the bed is nice and firm. The battery operated pump just does not do the job.
3,Does the job,"I bought this for when friends stay over in my studio apartment, and it does the job. It does loose a *little* air overnight. My biggest complaint is the fact that it did not come with the batteries for the pump."
4,My thoughts,"I'm constantly on the move moving from one location to another. Most of the time cots are well worn cots are available. I bought this mattress to achieve more restful sleep. It works as advertised. It seems to lose a little bit of air if it is not fully inflated. The pump works fine and isn't overly loud. It quickly inflates and deflates the mattress. All in all, I don't think that I got ripped off. I have definitely gotten my money's worth out of both the mattress and pump. I would recommend this to people who aren't prone to toss and turn a lot while sleeping."
1,Can't find the leak,I purchased this item on July 2. Well around July 10 I woke up to a flattened bed. It seemed to have leaked all its air out. I filled it back up with the pump and within an hour it was back down. I can not find the leak anywhere. Any suggestions? anyone? It was comfortable though when it was full for those few days. The pump was a little loud but I expected that. It was not that expensive but I did think it would last more that a few days. I do not have the box anymore or I would have sent it back. Thank you.
3,Quick bed,Quick bed keeps air pretty good. However; expected more of a bed; not an over rated air mattress.
1,Return to Sender: Took a month to arrive,"Didn't use it: they took weeks, even a month to arrive. By then i;d bought another one."
2,it's not that amazing,"i bought this for a guest visit. the air mattress has to be pumped every night, or it goes soft. i don't think it is that great if the user would have to refill it nightly. also the battery powered air pump is not very convenient, since buying and re-buying batteries is an additional cost to the user.i think i will have to return it. am kind of disappointed, since it's not as amazing as the reviews portrayed."
5,"Great mattrass, deceptive color",The inflatable mattress with portable pump is great. With a good set of batteries the mattress is inflated very quickly. Using the pump also deflates it quickly too. The mattress makes camping so much nicer. I got a great nights sleep every time I used it. In the original pictures of the mattress it looks gray or blue on top. Mine came and it was purple. I would have preferred a different color or at least something that matches the products picture. I would recommend this mattress and pump combo to anyone who is looking for one.
4,Great air mattress - but not for really tall people.,"I bought this air mattress and it has worked great. It pumps up easily and deflates easier than any other air mattress I have owned. It is very comfortable. Now, I sleep on my back and it fits me perfectly. I am 5'9"" and I fit on it just right will little room to spare lengthwise. A taller person might find it a little short for them. No reflection on this product. Just thought you tall folks might want to know. But, I am well pleased with this product."
1,not a very good book,"To sum it up, this book wasn't much helpful. I'm new to Poser and would like to get started on Poser. The author *plods* through Poser at a snail's pace! I gave it up and am waiting for a better Poser book to come out."
2,Save your money and buy Practical Poser,Just a rehash of the manual. Practical Poser is a MUCH better book that really takes you through the intricacies of Poser 6.Poser 6 Revealed basically teaches you the same the the tutorial manual does.
5,Awesome,"Needed something to track boost and vacuum in my truck and have never had any problems in the past with autometer products, this one works great!"
3,Looks nice but doesn't last,"Bought one of these a year ago. Gauge worked great until recently when it started registering boost when the car is not running. There's no adjustment knob to ""zero"" the gauge. Other people have ""zeroed"" the gauge by sticking a screwdriver into the hole where the light goes, but this did not work for me."
4,Good modem with limited cell capabilities,This has been a good modem for me but I am disappointed about the limited number of Cell phones it works with. I have a Sony phone that I can't connect because there isn't a cable that I can find to fit it. I guess card.
4,Great Advanced Reference,"It should be illegal to own this book if you aren't already very comfortable using LaTex. However, when you are ready to move beyond the default formatting of the LaTex macros, this book is absolutely necessary. I recently had to write my own document class for Technical Reports at my work place. I had used Kopka and Daly for years and was very satisfied, but found it to be of limited utility for things like redefining the sectioning commands or the \cite command. It is at this level that Goosens is most useful. This book also does a nice job of documenting lots of the more commonly used LaTex packages (so good, in fact, that the documentation for the ""supertabular"" package refers the reader to Goosens)."
1,The Latex Bible to Nowhere,"This book tries to provide an encyclopedic reference to Latex. It contains lots of good stuff which I have found useful. HOWEVER it is a dreadful book. This book was written by Latex gurus but they forgot that for a reference book to work it must index the simple as well as the archane. Trying to find out very simple things you might have forgotten (e.g. what are the allowed Latex charcters) and you spend hours flicking from index to pages on obscure packages. In the end I usually find myself looking it up on the web, until today ... when I vented my spleen by writing this."
1,Useless as a reference work.,"A computer book is in my opinion a reference book. This one isn't. The index is useless as entries refer to upto 20 places, whereas some packages are not mentioned. My advice: use the web for your latex troubles and save your money."
5,"Not for LaTeX beginners, great resource for experts","An up-to-date reference for experienced LaTeX users. This book does NOT contain an introduction to LaTeX. Rather, it assumes that the reader has a working LaTeX system and has written some documents before. The value of the book lies in its breadth of coverage. There is a solution for just about any LaTeX problem I can think of. Mostly, the solutions consist of a recommendation for some third-party LaTeX package (style file) and a short review of its use. But the book also covers some quite esoteric issues in-depth. For example, it contains the only introduction to BiBTeX style file programming that I'm aware of.An indispensable resource for serious LaTeX writing for those with high standards for their typesetting."
5,"Great reference, tons of detailed information","I found this book to be extremely useful as a reference. One can find things relatively quickly, and a wealth of information is available. It is definitely not an introduction to Latex."
5,My favorite,"Morton and Bassett is my favorite herbs de Provence. I've tried other, more expensive ""gourmet"" versions, but none of these please my palate quite like this one. I love the prominent lavender aroma and flavor. I use this all the time when I cook and especially love it on poultry. I even sprinkle it on sliced turkey kielbasa as it's cooking in the skillet and it's fantastic!I also used to find this at my local grocery store, but now have to order online and am so glad I found it on Amazon. Will have to try some other blends, like the previously mentioned 5-spice."
5,Beautiful Book!,"I bought this book as a gift for someone but after perusing through I decided to keep it for myself! Some of the pictures are really stunning! It is actually fun to read-not a stodgy old how-to manual. The book is very inspiring, it makes one believe that you too could take pictures like the ones in this book, with a bit of practice. Now I just need to buy a digital camera and another copy of the book for my brother!"
3,"""Naming Words?""","This book is extremely basic. That is not necessarily a bad thing; sometimes ""extremely basic"" is exactly what is needed. However, this book goes too far. On the *cover* it lists parts of speech -- preposition, verb, adverb, adjective, noun -- but *inside*, it covers only nouns, verbs, and adjectives. Worse, it never uses the words ""noun"" and ""adjective"" inside the book -- it calls nouns ""naming words"" and adjectives ""describing words."" So the child is given the definition, but not the actual vocabulary. For verbs, the book spends two units on ""action words"" without ever calling them ""verbs"" -- but then, in a later section, discusses ""linking verbs"" without ever defining the word ""verb"" or connecting linking verbs to the ""action words"" discussed earlier.The format and layout of this book are perfect for a beginning grammar workbook used with a child who is just beginning to read, but its failure to use consistent, proper vocabulary is a serious drawback."
2,One Lousy Movie,I watched this movie for the first time last night.All I can say is what a waste of film and good actors.The storyline was bizarre and uneven.The first half of the movie was a jumbled mess.Too slow.Then in the second half the movie picked up speed but fell apart.I felt like the story went out of its way to demean church and religion.Don't waste your valuable time watching this movie.
4,safe weapon for cosplay,"Actually I planned to buy real sword from UC for cosplay but real is too heavy to do it so that this is very light and easy to control, very great packing, thanks."
1,Big piece of junk!!,I received this in the mail...........it was bent in half to fit in the packaging..............kind of takes away from the usefulness of the sword when it is broken in half to begin with. Not even able to use it as a prop for Halloween. Does not say much for the quality control of the shipperI will never buy anything this cheap again.I am sorry that I spent the money on this one.I would like to warn anyone thinking of purchasing this item as a prop for Hallwoeen or any custume................PLEASE FORGET IT!!!!There are numerous other prop supply companies out there............do not buy from this one.
4,Would make a great movie!,"This is one of the better books I've read recently, and I loved the quick writing style -- did not feel it was choppy in the least. In fact, I was very impressed not only by the originality of the plot-- interwining science, ancient legends with spiritual concepts -- but by the structure of the book which complimented the plot perfectly. Part one, The Awakening, was the longest section, then part 2, the Quickening, was just that, quicker. And, finally, part three, Critical Mass was BAMM! I thought that was ingenious.Finally, the spirituality woven through the story made the book for me. Granted, it would be a great adventure story without the spiritual philosophy, but the genre is Visionary/Metaphysical fiction. Readers of that genre expect spiritual/metaphysical content. I wonder if the reader who objected to the New Age philosophy thought the book was ""normal"" science fiction.I've recommended this book to all of my friends, and wish someone would make a movie of it!"
3,Intriging,"I enjoyed this book but felt let down at the end. Maybe there's a second book coming to give the reader a better picture of how events continue. Having said that, the reading was interesting and had some suspense for an enjoyable read."
2,Stick with the originals,"You cannot improve on the Beach Boys...enough said. The sound quality is excellent, but the originals are no slouch in terms of sonics."
5,Deep Conditioning for Fine Hair,"I love this product. I have been using it for years and its one of the few things that I recommend to all my friends if they are having problems with their hair. I have fine hair and often found that deep conditioners left my hair feeling greasy and weighed down for a couple of days after use. However, this deep conditioner, I sleep with in a wrap over night and rinse out in the morning with a light shampoo and my hair feels like it has just had a good haircut - bouncy, healthy and shiny."
3,Neutrogena Triple Moisture Deep Recovery Hair Mask,"as with all products i've tried for my hair, i'm still looking for something that works . my hair feels soft afer using the hair mask and easy to get the tangles out, however, beyond that i dont see any advantage."
5,Neutrogena Triple Mask,"Love this product, best conditioner I've ever had for my hair. Bought it to make my hair color stand out; however I use it on my daughters hair as well. After it is rinsed out, the hair is so soft and easy to comb through. I would recommend this product to all who likes healthy hair, regardless of your race."
1,NO IMPROVEMENT for my long & colored hair,"Because my hair is so dry, I used this as a daily conditioner for 3 weeks. Unfortunately it didn't improve much.Luckily I found NICE 'N EASY ColorSeal Gloss by accident which works better for me."
5,LOVE THIS STUFF!,"This is one of the BEST hair masks for the price, hands down. I have thick, long, relaxed hair that is constantly in need of moisture. This does the trick everytime. I use it as a deep conditioning treatment and sit under the dryer for about 20 minutes. After you wash it out, your hair has great slip and is easy to detangle. Once your hair is dry, you will really see the benefits of using this product. I WISH they would come out with a larger jar of this stuff! Because my hair is SO thick, I could go through one jar in a month. Try it, you WON'T be sorry."
2,Not the results that I would expect from a deep conditioner,"I was very excited to try this product after reading all the great reviews it had. Unfortunately, it did not do anything for me that a normal conditioner wouldn't do. I was expecting my hair to be smoother, shinier, and healthier ... But nop, I got pretty poor results instead!"
3,"Mediocre, even for the price","Been using the product for over 2 months. Even for the price, it didn't do much more for my hair than a regular conditioner. My last treatment cream made my hair smooth and tangle free. I couldn't find it anywhere, but it's produced by Boot's (coconut and almond). That was so much cheaper and more effective.Instead of buying this, get a regular conditioner and use more than necessary. It'll have the same effect. Lastly, this was on sale at walgreen's for about $1 less 2 days ago when I went over."
4,"Simple to Use, and Gives Good Results","Neutrogena Triple Moisture Deep Recovery Hair Mask - 6 oz. I wasn't aware that Neutrogena made hair care, as well as skin care, products, but we have one right here. I've been using this product for a while, and find that I like it: it has a pleasant scent; yet it doesn't seem to activate any allergies, so it's evidently not overly perfumed. The packaging is handy, easy to grasp and work with. The product is simple to use, does not require the ultimately damaging utilization of a blow dryer, and gives good results: my hair feels as nurtured as when I have used beauty salon products that cost much more. It can be used weekly with good results."
3,Eh,"Eh - its ok. I have curly color treated hair. This is not too expensive and I don't think its the worst thing out there, but I definitely don't think its the best. This might be ok if you haven't abused your hair (like I unfortunately have). I prefer Alterna's leave-in overnight treatment. That's what I'll be buying!"
5,Love this stuff.,"This is a great conditioner. I have color-treated hair that is somewhat dry on the ends. Because basic conditioners don't seem to work very well for me, I tend to gravitate to the intensive ones. I use this daily because it makes my hair soft and shiny, without weighing it down, and leaves no residue:) Works well on my coarse greys too. The smell is pleasant and not overpowering, if that sort of thing is your concern. It costs more than I'd like to spend, but a little goes a long way."
3,Love the small,The smell is nice but I could not give it a better rating because the smell does not last as long as I would like it to.
2,Good smell but not for dog's with skin disorders,This shampoo smells good but seemed to worsen my dog's skin disorder (raw spots & scabbing). Recommend Sebolux over this shampoo if your dog has skin allergies.
5,Great Product,"Great Product, spend your money on one product that works instead of several that don't!"
5,Excellent,"This CD contains very well played pieces by several well known composers. However, the main reason I got this CD was for Vaughn Williams ""Fantasia on a Theme by Thomas Tallis"". Mr Slatkin's interpretation is by far my favorite of this masterpiece composition. It is well controlled and the climactic point of this piece is given room/time to breath and express itself. Very nicely done."
5,A Desert Island Disc,"There are several fine orchestral versions of the Satie's Gymnopédie. One of my favorite collections is by Slatkin's,in beatiful and luminous Telarc sound. It has other meditative pieces to contemplate as well: Vaughan Williams's famous Fantasia on a Theme by Thomas Tallis; Barber's Adagio for Strings (a tear-jerker used in the movie ""Platoon""); and a version of ""Danny Boy"" that you won't easily forget. This is one of those discs you keep in your car for traffic jams."
5,A wonderful album,One of my favorites. I lose my breath every time I here this cd. Absolutely beautiful.
3,"Mediocre and bland recording of an electric show,,,","I'm still shocked that the producers dropped Alice Ripley from this show in favor of Kerry Butler. Butler is fine in BAT BOY and HAIRSPRAY but cannot carry off this iconic role with any soul. She doesn't even seem compelled to show off her voice on this recording. That kind of malaise covers every character on this disc, even Chiffon, Crystal, and Ronnette!The only reason to buy this disc, besides the compulsive acquisition of cast recordings [THERE'S NO CURE], is actually to hear the demo recordings by Ashman and Menken. The fact that they were lovers (and that they were separated by a premature death) makes their duet recording of ""We'll Have Tomorrow,"" although rough [IT'S A DEMO!], beautiful sad and poignant. I cry every time I hear it."
2,Worth hearing for Douglas Sills and 2/3s of the Doo Wop Gals,"Dear Hunter Foster,I do not like you in a treeI do not like you with a beeI do not like you crushing antsI do not like you feeding plantsI do not like your singing voiceI do not like your acting choiceI do not like you in this bizI did not like you in Les MizYour singing makes me sadly frownEspecially in ""Urinetown.""I admire that Seymour never bossed herBut I do not like you, Hunter Foster.Take a voice lesson, jerk. At the end of Mushnik and son you hit the wrong note, then SLIDE to correct it at the end (""Mush-niiiiiiik"") and then hit this FOWL vowel on the word ""SON."""
1,Weak,"That's the only way to describe this effort. Except for Orrin, there is no energy at all in this recording. Although the Broadway version does give you more songs than either of the other choices for Little Shop, the problem isn't quantity, it's quality.If you're a fan of Little Shop, I suggest either the Off-Broadway or movie versions. I can't believe I spent $20 on this one."
4,Good stuff!,"I would love to give this recording a full 5 stars. I love having all the bonus tracks and complete musical score, but miss the vocal talents of the movie soundtrack cast. I would love to hear Ellen Greene and Rick Moranis do the whole Broadway score."
5,Musical soundtract reaches same height as movie,Being a big fan of the movie little shop of horrors I was excited to find out it was on broadyway. I have seen some offbroadway version of the show. I thought the music on the cd was great and that it bring the whole story to life as it was men't to be. I thought the difference between the movie soundtract and this one really made the soundtract good. I recommend buying the movie soundtract as well.
4,An awesome cast!,"OK, so I have not yet heard this cd, BUT I did see the show live, and I can state that this cast is absolutely amazing. Hunter Foster is (as usual) awesome. Rob Bartlett was very funny. Kerry Butler was amazing. She did a wonderful job with the role, brought her own stuff to the character, ditched the original Ellen Greene voice (I am not putting Ellen down, I adore her!), and sings the role beautifully. Her ""Somewhere That's Green"" is incredibly moving, and to be sitting two rows away from her during ""Suddenly Seymour"" was such an experience. Then, the doo-wop girls were fantastic. Some of their music was re-arranged, and some of their harmonies are closer, and they work very well together.I am also very glad that so many songs made it onto this cd, because there was stuff I missed on the original cast recording. The new orchestrations, and the new vocal arrangements are wonderful. I cannot wait to get this cd, because it's a great cast, and great Alan Menken music!"
5,"Let's Shop at ""Little Shop""","WOW! Once I listened to the new cast recording of LITTLE SHOP, I was hooked. The singing was amazing! If this show doesnt win for Best Revival of a Musical at the Tonys there there is something wrong. Hunter Foster leads a talented, youthful, and energetic cast and all are Tony winners in my mind."
4,Enjoyable,"""Little Shop Of Horrors"" been a performed in local productions since its Off-Broadway premier in 1982, but it didn't reach Broadway until this 2003 Revival.The cast is headed by Hunter Foster (""Urinetown"") and Kerry Butler (""Hairspray""). While both are excellent, Ms. Butler lives in the shadow of Ellen Greene, the show's original (& best) Audrey.Its great to see the return of certain tracks eliminated from the original 1982 cd [""Closed For Rennovation"", ""Somewhere That's Green (Reprise)], but they are not the show's highlights. The score's orchestrations are much improved, however, over the original's cd.Best tracks of this classic score:Prologue / Little Shop Of HorrorsSkid Row (Downtown)Somewhere That's GreenSuddenly Seymour"
4,Lots of Fun,I really enjoyed this soundtrack; it's has a 50s-ish style to it which can be really catchy sometimes. The vocals are nice and the music sounds great. Another must-have for those who enjoy Broadway.
5,Be Ready to Change Your Views!,"Commonly believed to be of a serious demeanor, this book will change your opinion of Jesus Christ. Tapping Scripture throughout, the author gives you a clear, concise picture of Jesus during His ministry... laughing, smiling, loving! Never did I think I would change my firmly rooted concepts of my Lord and Savior but this has completely done so. Originally, I watched ""The Gospel According to Matthew"" and could not wrap my mind around Jesus smiling or laughing in some of the Gospel stories. I followed that up with the ""Matthew"" actor's (Bruce Marchiano) ""In the Footsteps of Jesus"" and was blessed with the actor's experiences during the filming. In ""In the Footseps of Jesus"", Marchiano cited ""Jesus, Man of Joy"" which I ordered. It was phenomenal! Great volume although it's out of print and hard to come by. Worth the read without doubt!"
5,JOY!,Loved the book! Was a Joy to read and was very interesting. Glad someone took time to write a book about how happy and joyfull the Lord is.
4,Female DJ fans enjoy !,"I bought this as David Janssen in it, and for that it was most definitely worth it. Story & some of the lines made me laugh more than a bit. Sure DJ had fun making it. I's very corny but really quite fun.Great for female David Janssen fans :)"
1,save your money,"we purchased this faucet for a remodel it was our second choice as the first choice was not readily available, on back order for months. to finish the bath we selected this one. within 1 month the finish was coming off the base. we received another one from the parent company but have not installed it yet. in the meantime the finish has come off the sink stopper. I'm almost afraid to go ahead and install the new one. Will there be a problem again."
2,Not the Ultimate Wedding Album for me...,"I was really hoping for a great version of Sunrise, Sunset to dance with my son at his wedding. I was disappointed by the tinny, rapid version contained on this CD. Fred Astaire couldn't have danced to that version. I didn't even listen to the whole thing - very thin and tinny."
5,Hulk vs? More like Hulk WINS.,"I was skeptical when I heard that Marvel was releasing another animated feature, but seeing as it involved the Hulk going up against two of my favorite Marvel characters, I gave it the benefit of the doubt.And it didn't disappoint.I just finished Hulk vs Wolverine this morning and can't express how much I enjoyed it. With an epic fight scene between Logan and Banner, followed up with a cameo appearance by Deadpool,what's not to like? I was hooked during the first few moments and couldn't look away for the next 27 minutes.I'm currently in the process of watching Hulk vs Thor, ten minutes in to be precise. I'm a big fan of Thor and his legendary exploits, so I'm certain that I won't be let down.I highly recommend this DVD for any Marvel fan looking for a fun viewing experience."
5,Action Packed double feature!,"Two great short stories in one pack; great value for the money. Each story is different and separate; Fred Tatasciore as the Hulk is very good, as he was in each of the Avengers movies. The violence is much more graphic than your standard saturday-morning cartoon fare, especially Wolverine's. I would not recommend that one for anyone under 13, but the Thor story is ok down to 10 year-olds. I was especially impressed with the rendition of Thor and the Asgardians; good voice acting all around, and the drama was even to the point of being epic; it really had a good level of intensity."
3,Hulk Smash!,"Surprisingly enjoyable. The animation was very clean for a direct to DVD movie. While the segments were short, there was enough of a plot to make it feel like it wasn't a complete shallow action movie."
2,Thor episode is decent but Wolverine episode is shockingly grose!,"I enjoyed the Hulk vs. Thor episode. It was a little short on story and very predictable but the fight scenes were pretty good. A little too violent but nothing I thought that was totally over the top.The Wolverine episode was shockingly grotesque. Just like Thor the story was predicable and the episode was a little short on story. However, on the violence scale Hulk vs Thor was for preschoolers compared to this bad boy. If the amount of blood that was spilled in this episode was saved the blood bank would not be in need of any donors for weeks. It was just a grose feast of murder, blood, ripping arms off peoples bodies (while they're alive). I mean come on. It was disturbing. If this was live action instead of a cartoon it would have been pushing the NC-17 rating.Keep both these episodes away from small children!!! It says PG-13 and it means it.... for adults who enjoy gore fests you probably will enjoy this."
4,Hulk Smashes Thor in Asgard and Wolverine has't got a chance!!!,Wow! The Hulk looks way more hard in this than both of his theatrical releases! Great action on both but The Thor battle is clearly the best as he is forced to do battle in Hell!! You check out why! 4/5!
3,I have seen better from Marvel,This is a 2 story animation with lots of action but it didn't wow me. If I had to pick which was the best I would say that the Wolverine one was better. I was never much a fan of Thor but I think the story has pertanial. I didn't like the idea that Hulk and beat a God and I think that is where the story loses it flavor. Perhaps if they had used a different villian like Lowkie only that would have been better. I think only the comic fan would appreciate it more. I enjoyed the comic delights of Deadpool. I think the dvd is ok. It is not something I would want to go and buy. I rented it and was glad I did. Would I watch it again? Yes I would being a Marvel fan and all.
1,Disappointing as usual,"Very poor plot. Not much of a story, but it is action pack.It's hard to believe that Wolverine did better against the Hulk than Thor did, when in truth Thor is Marvel's most powerful superhero. How many times did the Hulk took a licking from Thor in the comic book? And how many times did Thor killed him?Marvel is like WWE. Whoever is the most popular wins, the other one becomes a heel.Oh well, being a Marvel fan I would say buy it, but don't expect anything great."
3,O V E R-R A T E D!,"these other reviewers must be nuts cause the story line on both these tales were ok at best with hulk vs thor being the better of the two-the hulk vs wolverine was a farce! they fought for like a minute(maybe less) and then the battle was over-in typical marvel fashion-it left me thinking that was it?! it reminded me of when i use to buy a marvel comic with two classic characters battling hard on the cover only to open it up and see them take 2 swipes at each other and then decide to be friends-though in hulk vs wolvy's case they just left the ending open with both of them lunging at each other-how lame! I expected a whopper with cheese and instead i got a soy burger with fat free cheese and a wheat bun, uuuuuuuuuugh!"
5,Marvel at its Best.,"Fantastic Marvel Animation. Definitely a Marvel animation geared more for adults and older teens.But this is Marvel at its best. This is the Marvel without the PC stuff, this is un-waterdown Marvel. This is the raw in your face Marvel --similar to the Jim Lee/Todd Mcfarlene Xmen/Spiderman era.Out of all the Marvel animation I have seen, this I would say, is the best I have seen so far."
4,Hulk Smash!,"Hulk Vs. has really good animation quality and seeing it in HD is really nice. The story lines for both stories are fun I especially like what's hidden after the credits in Hulk Vs. Wolverine. The voice acting was well done as well. Anyone who is a big fan of Hulk, Thor or Wolverine will really enjoy this disc."
5,hulk vs.,"The movie came in good condition. The movie came earlier than the stated time, much more convenient for me."
4,Pretty good,"Well, yes. Anyone expecting these short animated segments to be incredible might be disappointed. I enjoyed them and felt they were worth what I paid for, which wasn't all that much. They aren't as good as DC's New Frontier, but it was still pretty good for what it was. The Wolverine short was the weaker of the two, in my opinion, but still worth it to see Wolverine slice through limbs while leaving a bloody trail."
3,Too Predictable...,"I had seen lots of trailers for this DVD on-line from Marvel and it looked great, so I was anxious to see it. On viewing, I had mixed feelings. The animation is good quality and looks fabulous on Blu-Ray, especially Asgard. On the other hand, the two stories are so predictable that you could write them before you open the box. I wasn't expecting it to be an Oscar winner, but I did expect it to be a DVD I would want to watch more than once."
3,Eh....,"Unless you're serious about adding to your Marvel collection, I would not buy this DVD. It's got OK action, but the problem is that it's two short movies in one dvd, so you don't really get into the plot. It's like one show on TV. I really only bought this dvd to meet the free shipping cutoff for Amazon with my other purchase."
5,Hulk vs Wolverine/Hulk vs Thor,THIS IS GREAT GREAT STUFF FOLKS. HULK IS REALLY BADASS TO THE BONE IN THIS ONE. IF YOU ENJOY SUPERHEROES AND WELL DONE ACTION COMBINED WITH GOOD STORY TELLING THEN THIS IS FOR YOU. IF YOU HAVE SEEN THIS BEFORE THEN SEE IT AGAIN BUT BE SURE IT IS BLU-RAY. IT IS LIKE WATCHING IT FOR THE FIRST TIME. THE COLORS JUMP OF THE SCREEN INTO YOUR LIVING ROOM.
2,A must for The Hulk's biggest fans,"If you're looking for The Hulk to just totally create chaos and carnage and beat everyone around him to a bloody pulp, you will LOVE this film. If you're looking for a more logical storyline that gives fair tributes to the highlighted characters involved, you probably are looking in the wrong place. The animation of these two films is pretty impressive and detailed, but the stories and logic behind it are faulty. I've never been a huge Marvel follower, but I do know that Thor is incredibly powerful and has been written as such. He was treated in the script with such disdain for his power and force of will. Whoever created these films either hates Thor or worships Hulk, or both. There's no way that Wolverine can inflict more damage on The Hulk than a God of thunder can, and anyone who argues otherwise is a blind Hulk fan. I like Hulk's character and find his power awesome, but the way Thor was handled in this film was rather pathetic."
4,Hulk Vs. Thor is a great animated feature!,"Hulk Vs. Thor is a great animated feature. I like this video 45 minute feature that takes the Hulk to Asgard. I like story and how it combined all the Marvel characters like Loki, Thor, and the Hulk. The Mighty Thor battles the Incredible Hulk manipulated by Loki, the god of Mischeif. Hulk Vs. Wolverine was not as good. Wolverine battles the Incredible Hulk in Canada. Hulk Vs. Wolverine with apperances by Marvel characters like Deadpool, Lady Deathstrike, Sabertooth, and Omega Red. The second animated feature was too bloody and violent. I suggest you watch the first animated feature, Hulk Vs. Thor! B"
1,Save your money,"If your going to buy knives for this price buy the best knives of a cheaper company instead of these inferior quality ""Steak"" knives. Although well balanced and nice looking the blade is extreemely flimsy and cuts steaks very poorly. Following the purchase of these knives I recieved som Chicago Cutlery steak knives as a gift and since then the only times these have left the drawer is when I have had more guests than good knives."
3,blades very thin,"The handles on these knives are very comfortable, and the non-serrated blades make a nice, clean slice. Unfortunately, the blades are very thin, and, in fact, the packages that I received had multiple broken knives upon arrival. (Amazon did immediately replace the broken ones.) I have found that I have to baby these knives while cleaning and storing since it is very easy to bend the tips. Too bad, because otherwise they would be perfect."
1,Bait and switch,"Metro Kitchen sent me a MUCH cheaper set than the item pictured here. The blades we not forged, instead they were thin stamped metal (rather than widening at the base of the handle), and the blade did not even go completely through the handle. They did send me a ""Gourmet Steak Block Set"", however the picture they user on Amazon is not the same set, and is therefore completely misleading as to the quality. They unapologetically offered to take the item back if I PAID THE RETURN SHIPPING! I have obviously contacted my credit card company....Your choice, but I woul NOT do business with Metro Kitchen if I were you."
1,8/12 HANDLES BROKEN,"I purchased two sets of these knives for x-mas 2002. Within 3 months 6 out of twelve knives had cracks on the handles in the same place, by now 8/12 have cracks in the handles. We wash them in the dishwasher along with our other Wusthof knives and the other more expensive Wusthof knives have never had a problen. Also when washing these in the dishwasher the steak knives get rust stains on them that we have to polish by hand. I have been very dissapointed with the quality of these steak knives and will try to contact the company about the warranty."
1,terrible,"i was sent the wrong item, some replacement item, i could not have this sent to an apo, so i had to have my son in arizona send it to me, then i would have to send it back to the originator. may they ran out of stock on the original item ordered but there was no explanation or nothing. very unhappy & they didn't taste as great."
5,Copland's Rodeo etc,"This cd won a well-deserved Grammy award the year it came out. It is a clean, precise rendition of beautiful pieces. Louis Lane is at his usual precise, perfected style and it is a joy to listen to this piece. You can ""see"" every nuance, every portrait that Mr. Copland is composing. It is a beautiful album, well worth having in one's collection."
5,First Rate Recording,The sound quality of this CD is nothing less than stupendous. The Fanfare will separate the men from the boys when it comes to exhibiting the potential (or lack thereof) of high end audio equipment. What a find.
3,"Music is good, quality is poor","Trying to buy some cd's for my business and thought Copland would fit the bill. It does, but the quality of the cd leaves a lot to be desired."
4,All my Copland Favorites,Good collection of Copland pieces. I use it for American music in our retail store in combination with Sousa marches and other patriotic pieces. Quality is fine.
2,Copeland,"Tho' not Amazon's problem, I thought THIS PARTICULAR album (CD) was not good. Other Copeland CD's I have are great. Not this one!"
1,For powershot g9 users.,This product does not work for the powershot g9.The plug which is not an angle will not allow you toclose the battery compartment and therefore does not work.You need to buy another part that which fits into thecamera and allows you to connect the adaptor to it. That isonly available from Canon for 24.09 includes shipping.I bought that part and then found out that it still did not work.This should not be listed for the powershot g9. This cost meforty dollars for nothing. T
1,DO NOT BUY!,"Do not buy this supposed CA-PS700. It is poor imitation of the real thing. I bought one and it died after two weeks. The plug doesn't hold into a socket, so I had to secure it with tape. The real thing is here:Canon CA-PS700 Compact Power Wall Adapter for Elura 50,S1 IS, S2 IS, S3 IS & Digital Rebel XT/XTi Cameras. If it isn't ""by canon"" stay far away. The real thing may cost more but it is worth the money."
2,and another thing i hate about this show,the characters almost never seem like real people. but not to worry because the real thing is coming and her name is MAUDE season 1 and $10 cheaper!
4,Golden Girls presents issues of society with humor.,This show has comedy but also handles many issues in society. It is superior to most of the current situation comedies because it often presents a problem and then has the characters attempt to solve it. I am sick and tired of the totally disfunctional characters and families of current shows. There has been a constant deterioration of television for years. This is quality comedy and worth viewing by young people as well as those of us who viewed it when it was first aired. Some of these shows really make you think.
5,for my daughter,She loves this show! My daughter watches this show all the time. She can still laugh even if she has seen the same show 100 times
5,Golden Girls Is My Life,"I watch Golden Girls every day of my life. It is by far the best tv show of all time. Season five has two of my favorite episodes, which are.....when Blanche discovers her husband is still alive, and when Phil dies. I love them all, but those two are dear to my heart. I hate that I only have one more season to look forward to. ugh!"
5,Love Estelle Getty,I ama Golden Girls fanatic. I have 1-6 of all the episodes. I have the last Season on my Wish List. Estelle Getty makes me laugh hysterically.
5,"Golden Girls, Golden Years!",I am a huuuuge Golden fan and this is one of the BEST seasons out! This series got me through some hard times. It always made me feel good when others failed to..Recommended to all!DONT FORGET TO BUY THE SEVENTH SEASON OUT SOON!
5,Just what I ordered,The Golden Girls: The complete 6th season -- just what I ordered I will order again when I need a gift
5,golden all the way,"Excellent show worth watching. Catch Rose, Dorothy, Blanche and Sofia getting in and out of troubble and sharing life experiences."
5,Great Pack!,"I bought the Kelty Red Cloud ST 5000 first and it just didn't fit right. Then I got this one made especially for women and wow what a difference in the fit. I would recommend this pack for anyone taking a longer backpacking trip. Mine is'nt this pretty purple and grey color, I got mine when they were still blue and dark gray. I'll have to say I prefer the darker colors because of dirt."
5,Cannot be beat for the price.,"For the price, it would be difficult to beat this one. It rides well, is comfortable, and since I am a rather small person (very, very strong, but small), it fit quite well. There are plenty of side pockets and it wears quite well. It is perfect for a week long trip but I did take in on a three week jaunt and while I did have to resupply twice, it got me through. Suggest you choose a darker color due to the dirt situation. Suggest that you purchase an over-tarp for rainy weather since this pack, like ever pack that I ever owned, does leek somewhat. I will say that this is the easiest pack I have ever used on my back. Women are built a bit different than men in this way and the design needs to be a bit different. While I am sure I will try others in the future, I am certainly satisfied with this one at this time. This pack can also take quite a beating."
3,"Good product, bad package","Carmex is a great product. It's effective yet not harsh so you can use it everyday. However, the Carmex Tube is not a product I would wish to use everyday.Unlike most lip treatments in stick form, this tube contains extremely liquid-y and greasy. It's not something I would like to use casually as it's extremely messy. The tube isn't good for precise control over how much product is squeezed out and the product tends to build up outside of the lips, on the surrounding skin.Additionally, this product also has the chemical smell of most Carmex products and the scent is more harsh than, say, the stick version of Carmex.Overall, Carmex is a good product but it doesn't work well in the tube form."
5,fun and educational,My four year old loves this toy! I was unsure at first but she suprised me at how well she can make the city and people. It's a toy I feel good about because it makes her use her imagination and creativity.
5,Maxicrop Seaweed Soluble Powder,"I use it on seedlings, established plants, vegetables, berries...any plant indoors or out. The plants respond within 24 hrs, never see burn, wilt, yellowing. A fantastic organic food for plants."
3,Great overview of what is wrong with accounting...,"The Good: It provides a decent overview of the history of Arthur Andersen leading to the Enron debacle, and a good historical perspective of events leading to the downfall of AA. Also reaches some interesting conclusions at the end.The Bad: Like another reviewer said, there's no in-depth ""inside"" look at what was going on in the Houston office, or really any explanation for the Waste Management, Sunbeam or WorldCom restatements beyond what's presented in the overview. It's not so much ""Inside Arthur Andersen"" as it is ""The Rise and Fall of Arthur Andersen"".The Ugly: It's really far too short, and too heavily reliant on newspaper and internal AA documentation. I found a lot of things informative and enlightening about the book--but I admit I knew almost nothing about what happened before I read this book. It's a great starting point, and it raises many more questions and paths of inquiry than it does answer or solve anything."
1,A total yawn,"I think it's a pity how one of the world's most esteemed brands was wrecked by greedy, unscrupulous people and uncaring managers who checked their values at the door (if they ever had them to check). I was actually looking forward to reading the inside story. But this book reads like a patchwork quilt of news articles and interviews that are in the public domain. If you've kept up with the business press you'll likely find little that is new. The publisher should have asked for more rather than rush this out to capitalize on the corporate scandals."
1,Big dissapointment,This book fails to live up to its promise - there is a good deal of repetition throughout the book both in terms of assertions and content.
5,This CD really lifts your spirits,"I love the variety of heartfelt songs in this collection. When I am down, they really remind me of how to be positive again. I would drive around without it in my CD player."
5,Worth it.,"A shoe bag seems like the kind of superfluous travel accessory that only the genius possess and the insane lament. Well let me tell you, for the many summers I've spent in Rangoon, it's turned out to be indispensable. I've owned this bag for years, and I""m just now writing this review, since I just noticed again how useful it is. You're most likely always going to travel w/ two or more pairs of shoes (business/casual/sport) and plastic bags work, technically, but they look like crap and float around the hotel room (when you're not looking, like ghosts in Super Mario Brothers) and make a mess. The shirt-folder things are really great, too. Get 'um all! They make packing and orgaizing much easier."
2,disappointing,"I pick up MAW albums without any hesitation because my past expeience has always been very pleasing, so I picked up this one as soon as I saw it in the store (I didnt even listen to it). The album is very disappointing. No good flow, the track selection is poor and it doesnt get you moving at all. I recommend you better save your money for something else, even though it is from the past summer, Juniorjack/Kid Creme in the house is 5 times better than this album.It has become very difficult to get a good house compilation lately and the best names comtinue to surprise me with very poor albums. I would also recommend ""el divino ibiza 03"" and ""saaed & palash - additive beats"" if you still want to listen good house music."
5,casey is great.,ok if you have trouble fitting his golfbag over his head it doesn't fit over his head! you have too unsnap and snap his strap so it can fit i tried putting the strap over his head and it snapped so i asked my dad to help and he snapped it back over casey's shoulder across his chest and over one shoulder that's how they did it in the picture if you didn't figure it out yet.
4,Casey Jones better than ever!,"I bought this toy not too long ago and it has lived up to my most wild expectations. I have all the other toys and Casey is a perfect addition to any toy collecters...collection. Casey comes with a variety of things, like a hockey stick and a goalies mask. This toy can take punishment too, it is quite well made together, so all in all it is a magnificent toy."
5,My 4 year old LOVED this one!,My 4 year old son had the best time trying to find the hidden pictures in this book. He wanted to look at it every night before bed for about 2 weeks. The book has lots of hidden pictures that you and your child will both have lots of fun finding! My 2 year old even liked it! We're going to get other books like this by the same author for sure!
4,Pretty Impressive,"Well well well... here we go again with the Wraith, both versions, with the majority of both records remixed by an impressive list of talent. To be honest, I feel like the Shangri La record is the better of the two, considering I wasn't a big fan of the original, so it's cool to actually hear decent beats and a different take on it. Hell's Pit, my favorite original of the two, got the lesser makeover. A lot of the remixes are very lazily done, with the exception of The Witch, Burning Up, and Manic Depressive, which was a HORRIBLE song, but thanks to Fritz, gets a breath of new life. Overall it's an impressive album that I think all juggalos will enjoy, and man, it sure sounds good on the stereo system with a decent amount of bass, don't be afraid to crank this one up and enjoy the wraith all over again. 4 outta 5. NOW RELEASE THE F***IN' TEMPEST!!!"
5,The Best Of Both Planes Of Existence,"The Wraith: Remix Albums are amazing, both discs are filled with amazing remixes of songs from both Shangri-La and Hell's PitI enjoy Almost every single remix on both CDsI Highly Recommend this for any JuggaloMMFCL!!"
4,good remixs,i reckon it was a good idea for icp to do this they dnt remix much of there music.mike e clark is a god on this.kottonmouth kings remix are awesome also the wolfpac remix are cool.any one into icp should give it a go i think you will like it.
4,HIGH QUALITY AT A LOW PRICE,"I bought these diffusers as well as a similar white diffuser to use with an ALZO Digital zoom/tilt/swivel Porta-Flash rather than the Canon 580EX flash that they are made to fit. They are a very tight fit on my flash but they do fit and I like the tight fit because I don't have to worry about them coming loose under use. If you don't understand why you would need diffusers in these colors the truth is that you almost certainly don't need them if you have any kind of modern electronic digital camera because these cameras are intended to adjust for existing light that is either too ""cool"" or too ""warm"" - most digital cameras do this automatically. However,these diffusers still might be used for insurance purposes by photographers who need to have certain photographs turn out with the correct color balance. I haven't tried it yet but I intend to use them for special effects photography. They didn't cost much so I felt that it was worth a try."
3,Doesn't hold my attention,"I've come back to this CD a number of times over the years, and I always lose interest. As a resident of greater Boston I was predisposed to love this recording, so I felt guilty about my indifference. I figured the problem must be that the work is not to my liking. I was proved wrong by the recent box setEugene Ormandy Conducts 20th Century Classics. Ormandy's performance of the second suite with the Philadelphia Orchestra shimmers with all the tiny details of the score, and the ah-ooh-ah of the chorus is simply gorgeous. There is nothing particularly hateful about Haitink and the BSO, but they don't seem to tap into the same magic."
5,Great product!,"This is exactly what I needed to create gift tags for Christmas - using both cardstock paper and canvas material. I can stamp a design on it, write ""to/from"" with a Sharpie marker and I'm set! I've also used the set to create price tags for a care center gift shop that I volunteer at. The staff and residents love the new look of the price tags!"
5,Finest kind of reading,Fiercely intelligent book but better than that -- it's a great read. I like it when a book is both intelligent and readable; I like it even more when it's this finest kind. Randall's chops rock.
4,Nice Photos But Lacking in Completeness,"The size (length and breadth) of this book is good for showing artwork --- big enough to show detail, and the photos in the book are very well-taken. Such a standard in photography is commendable.On the down side, this book is no ""encyclopedia"" of goddesses; it is not exhaustive in collection of pictures/photos of various cultures, but shows only the well-known ones.I would give 5 stars for the pictures and 3 for coverage of the various goddesses. Hence 4 stars.On the whole, it is a nice book and worth a place on your bookshelf."
5,I heard it on public radio and rushed home to order it!,"I heard the Cincinnati Jazz Ensemble of the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra version on Public Radio in Mississippi on my way home from work. As soon as I got in the door, I went to amazon.com to look for the title and order. I think it's the best arrangement and recording of ""Rhapsody in Blue"" I've ever heard. I loved it!!"
3,Not as expected,"Though I'm glad music fan enjoyed this disc, and while List is excellent as always and the Cincinnati is up to the task, the Rhapsody in Blue is done with full orchestra, not Jazz Ensemble. Anyone looking forward to the original and rarely heard original jazz version will be disappointed to hear yet another full though not necessarily overblown orchestral rendering."
1,Hose too small!,"It appears to be a large hose, but when I got it, it was really small, wrong hose, does not fit."
4,A great book to hold,"Not only is this an interesting and moving story, but the book itself is lovely. Its cover is handsome enough to frame. It's a great size, small enough almost to carry in a pocket, and is on good paper, with an interesting type that doesn't distract."
2,this book art boring,"What a great concept! What a lame book!I thought this was going to be a fun read. It starts off great, with the spirit of the deceased father hanging out in a tree- communicating to the family, but it just doesn't really go anywhere from there.It's all about the tree & what could be a fruitful (pun intended) plot point just falls dull.Coming of age? barely. Dealing with death? not in the interesting way it could have been. Lots of books out there to read? yes. Should this be one of them? Not unless you've never read a book about a child whose parent dies, and you can't find anything better.Skip it."
5,The Spirutal Side Of Louis,"Hello jazz fans,This one is for you.I am a very big fan of Louis Armstrong and Universal CD'S and this is a must get.Why-this is thespirtual side of Louis that you must hear.Very excelent sound quality CD also, amazing.Mark Greenidge (from Barbados)"
2,Not his best by a mile,"I think there were maybe two songs out of the 27 that I really thought were worth listening to. I was very disappointed with this group of songs. Jerry Lee is out of his league when he tries to sing gospel songs,he should leave those to Jimmy Swaggert. I prefer The love songs that Jerry sings; some of the more up tempo songs just give me a headache.I wouldn't buy this again, no way."
4,"Good, easy to use book","I bought this book as a requirement for a class, but am finding it easy to read and full of useful information."
4,Super Reader,"What sort of woman would a rogue and a thief and now a secret agent super-operative type be interested in? Well, in the case of Slippery Jim di Griz it appears that the woman is an uber-version of his old self, and he did end up pursuing in more ways than one.The Rat was not a violent man, the one who set his hormones aflutter didn't mind a bit of shooting. After a bit of readjustment, they married, save the universe, and have kids.Amusing, again."
5,Tarragon Vinegar is so hard to find,"I was pleased to locate a source for tarragon vinegar. I enjoy using it on salads and this one was particularly good. It seems to have just disappeared from the stores to be replaced with balsamic vinegar in a variety of formats. Sometimes, you just need something different from balsamic or apple vinegar. It was great to find it on Amazon."
3,Worth the Battle (and the Forrester),"As others have noted, I found the recording level to be low, but also the dynamic range to be quite high. Setting the volume to about 11 o'clock on my dial (NO other CD needs to be set past about 9:30) in order to hear the quiet passages, I get blasted by the louder passages. I don't agree with some others that Slatkin is plodding; I think he feels the music and conveys that feeling through the orchestra. But I don't think he's any better in this regard than my unsung favorite for the whole Mahler cycle, viz., the Gary Bertini full set on the EMI label. Here, I found the vocal parts by Forrester and Battle to be superior to any other I've heard. They save the disc as far as I'm concerned.One other downside is that the last movement, which is very long and contains a number of themes, is not broken up into several tracks as it is on the Bertini-EMI set.Bottom line: the artists are good to excellent; the engineers/mixers/editors get a C-."
5,Straightforward approach,"Worth buying and treasuring just for the amazing, disciplined playing and singing, coupled with gorgeous tones all around.Slatkin's approach is, not unusual, straightforward, concentrating on the letter of the score. That does not to say that he doesn't mine the emotional content--he does. I prefer a more characterful approach--and Gielen's most recent recording certainly delivers that in spades, as does Scherchen's ancient MCA recording (which can not be said to have decent engineering or flawless playing)--but this performance serves quite nicely. It is in the same mold as Litton's in Dallas.The recorded sound is fine, although a little more impace would've been appreciated.Excellent all around."
2,"A good way to kill your time, but it may kill your brain also","If you want a no-brainer book with lots of action, lots ofblood & lots of sex, than this book is for you. Because this bookhas a lot of those elements, but nothing more. It offer absoluatly nothing new concerning the tactic, the technology or the thinking of special operation. It seems that all the female agents in the world only use sex to collect intellence. So, if you want only sex & blood, this is your book. Otherwise, avoid this."
1,Not waterproof,"One of the barrels got condensation on the first outing. Even more annoying is that the warranty does not cover shipping back to Pentax for repair/replacement. And Pentax call themselves a ""Premium Brand""!"
1,Boring!,Found this book bland. The romance between H/H was unconvincing. The sexual chemistry & overall sensuality was tepid. I skipped pages just to get it over with. Not recommended.
5,"Beautiful and interesting, not schmaltzy at all",".Those familiar with Brubeck's light touch will be pleasantly surprised here. Brubeck consistently delivers that light touch, but avoids the schmaltz so often heard on 'pretty piano' Christmas albums. The left hand is used judiciously, the improvisations (if they are improviations) are interesting, and it's a nice mix of well-known and less heard music. We play it frequently during the holidays. (Solo piano only, by the way.)"
4,Nice package,"I was hoping for the inclusion of Dave Brubeck Quartet's hit of ""Santa Claus is Coming to Town"" because that is nearly impossible to find on a CD. Otherwise this CD is a nice selection of holiday favorites done by Dave on the piano."
2,Sounds like Dave had too much turkey and eggnog,"This is awful. Anyone who is a fan of Brubeck, or jazz, or piano in general will be disappointed. The songs are limp and uninspired. The music quickly blends into the background as it is so poorly produced and played there is nothing worth listening to. Get The Charlie Brown Christmas or, if you're more serious, the George Shearing Quintet's Christmas album instead."
1,You do not need this CD,"Unfortunately, I did not heed the comments of previous reviewers. This CD is just ""Christmas Musak"" of the most insipid kind. The original songs are so much better. Too bad."
3,Enjoyed the more current recordings more than the early music,"I didn't enjoy enough of this music to give this a great rating. I enjoyed the later recordings such as The Christmas Song. I actually hated Santa Claus is coming to town. This is a broad selection of Dave Brubeck's playing styles so that is something to consider when listening to this album. Personally, I wasn't that happy with it because of the mixed bag of playing styles but that could be just me."
3,Great music but volume is too low,Great piano music for Christmas! Brubeck was incredible.But the volume on the MP3s is much too low. Hardly audible in places. And why is there at least 10 seconds of silence at the end of the first track? Somebody messed up in translating this from the CD to MP3s.
3,Solid piano playing but boring overall,"I love Dave Brubeck and was hoping for a lot more from this disc. It's like he just opened up a book of Christmas standards and started to play note for note. Sure, it's good solid piano playing but Dave doesn't seem to add too much. It's just kind of there and everyone I know gets bored of it after the first few songs. If your looking for a great jazz piano X-mas disc, and you don't have it already, get Vince Guaraldi's Charlie Brown Christmas instead."
3,Decent music -- awful engineering,"Pretty good solo piano Christmas music.The CD, however, is horribly mastered/engineered. All the tracks are FAR too quiet. If you rip it onto a PC and normalize it to a decent level, it will sound dramatically better."
5,None Better,Dave Brubeck all alone playing Christmas Carols. It doesn't get any better than that. There are no disappointments in this beautiful album.
3,Bell,"It was not comfortable, and not soft enough, and the ribbon was tight and very hard. It says- made with pride in China, if I knew I even would not buy. I had to return it. I am very pleased with Majamas organic easy bra made in USA."
3,A glorified sports bra,"I returned this. Somehow I can't imagine being engorged and wearing a glorified sports bra. Had I realized it fit over the head, I would never have purchased it. My fault for not looking more closely."
1,Returned it...,"After reading and hearing so many excellent reviews, I was excited to order this bra. However, I don't know what all the raving was for... Was not impressed one bit. Sizing was awkward, hated that it was a slip-on style. No support whatsoever. Not meant for larger chest sizes even though they carry the size."
3,nice bra!,"was very nice but sizing is incorrect, It is well made. The color was correct and it seems to me if the sizing were correct I would buy it again."
3,Meh,"Not a fan of the strap that's too long when hooked. Poor design and unnecessary. Bravado's other bra is much better than this one. That being said, I own 2 of this one, and it's ""ok"". I seem to have a problem with falling out of this one."
4,Great Bra - Not Great sizing info,"I really love this bra, but I don't love the sizing info.. What is written on the bras is different from what's on the amazon listing, and it's different depending on who is selling the bra.. it's confusing. I knew what size I wanted but wasn't sure when ordering that I was actually ordering the size I wanted as they were called different things from the bras to the listing."
1,Sent the wrong bra!!!,"I ordered the Bravado Original Nursing Bra size M++ in white. I got a Platex 18 hour bra size 36DD in blue. It's the wrong brand, wrong color, wrong size. It's not even a nursing bra! And now, I have to go to the post office within 28 days to return it in order to get my money back - not very easy to do with a newborn."
5,Great nursing bra!,Great nursing bra for large chested ladies. Comfortable to wear day & night. Good fit. Easy off & on. I have washed numerous times (cold water in a delicates bag then hang dry) & it still fits like new.
3,Poor support,This bra works great for a sleep bra but it does not provide great support. I am a size G and this bra does not provide any support but it does provide comfort when sleeping with the bra on.
5,Good bra!,"I am very large breasted (38 E) and this bra is a miracle for me. I hate bras--always have, but this one is quite comfortable and convenient. Definitely worth the money. I'll have to spoil myself by ordering a couple more at some point."
2,Would not buy again,"I imagine this bra would work well if you had a small or medium bust. I do not and found it less supportive than I would have liked. Also, I did not realize it had to be pulled over your head. I find that awkward and uncomfortable, especially in the early months of nursing when my breasts are sore and hurting. I would not buy this bra again."
2,didn't last long,The bra was the correct size I needed and could use for nursing. After 2 weeks the bra ripped and was no longer useful. I was very disappointed in the quality.
