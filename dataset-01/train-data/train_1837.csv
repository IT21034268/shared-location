2,didnt look like the picture,They didnt look like the ones on the picture. Maybe you need really long legs for them to stretch so that look like the ones in the picture. On my wife they looked like pantyhose with a couple of little cut-outs on the sides. She didnt like the style.
3,Not quite long enough,"These pantyhose have great potential, but potential buyers and wearers need to know that ""one size fits all"" doesn't. I'm 5'9"" and weigh 150 pounds. These panythose just barely fit. I'm afraid to sneeze in them."
4,Sheer Suspender Pantyhose,"WONDERFUL product. I had so much fun wearing these. I only wish the toes were reinforced better; but still, I loved them. Thank you so very much!"
2,Not for short legs,Why is it that not one hosiery maker realizes that there are short people. These will cut into inner thighs on short people.
2,Not plus size,While it says plus size it does not fit a 5'3 woman with a size 14 waist at 165#. Too tight!
5,Thrive Diet,"Brendan's book Thrive Diet has become my BIBLE for Vegan nutrition.As he is a very successful athlete who personally explored many different approaches to getting the nutrients he needs for peak performance.I appreciate learning from his experience - especially when it comes to endurance which is critical for a participating in triathlons.His recipes are simple and easy to prepare and his explanations of the function of various foods are easy to understand. I love the fact that when I eat some of the dishes he outlined in his book I felt very full with small portions, leaving me with so much more energy.This book is a MUST have for anyone who wants to understand vegan nutrition and take their athletic performance to the highest level.Raw vegan food will completely change your life and Brendan's book Thrive Diet will quickly assist you in a smooth transition."
2,Good but.....,"The concept is good and how hi marketed is just brilliant.But he is now selling his own products what is not ""natural"" in of terms of eating fresh vegan food.The second failure is that he is not tells nothing about B12 what is unforgivable for my point of view if you do such a book about proper nutrition and with analytical systems.Personally I think that was a good way to cash in the yeas of training after he stopped.Go to the [...] these guys doing much better job for 30 years or more.Good luck"
2,Turkey Chair,I was looking for a chair that is light enough to take out in the woods with me when I go out to take pictures of the animals near my home. The chair needs to be comfortable in order for me to stay still. I'm 6' tall. The back of the chair hits me right in below the shoulder blades and is terribly uncomfortable. I'll keep looking.
5,The Coil....,"A wonderful tale of suspense! I never thought I'd get so sucked into the story as I did. I rarely read suspense, but THE COIL is an engaging fast paced story. I read at night before I sleep, and there I was at 6 a.m. still reading. I was fighting sleep to read it. I wasn't expecting Gayle to kill the Secretary of State. It was surprising. She can be VERY proud of her work. She writes a wonderful, intriguing tale...."
1,"Don't waste your time, save your money.","I don't like Robert Ludlum. There, I've said it! His style is too detached and I just can't get into it.Having said that, and being that Gayle Lynds co-wrote several novels with Ludlum, I should have known better. That a protege of Ludlum's could write something that I would enjoy... Fat chance. If I could give this book zero or negative stars, I would.I tried to get into/inside this book; really I did. I lasted halfway though, but the damn thing just wouldn't take off. If blood and guts is your thing, there's plenty of that. Nearly everyone that Liz meets or is acquainted with gets killed. I swear, someone gets offed on nearly every page.In spite of my bloodlust, the plot never really took off. I lasted halfway though it and finally turned to Jack Higgins, who knows how to cut through the crap and make the plot go. Higgins' book made me abandon other possibly more important things to find out what happens. The Coil never even came close.You have been warned."
1,Bad Author,"The Book should be good. it's such a blatant rip-off of Robert Ludlums ""The Chancellor Manuscript"" I'm surprised she bothered to change the names of the charactors!!!If you want to read a good book the the original, NOT her copy!!!!"
1,Very poorly written,"I love spy thrillers, but this one fizzled out after a strong start. The writing was so poor starting about 100 pages in, I gave up soon after. Lynds repeatedly tells us what the character is feeling rather than showing us, and I hate that, it is a hallmark of poor fiction writing.The first several chapter though, were quite strong, and very reminiscent of Ludlum. Did he write the first few chapters for his protege before he passed away? I don't know, but it's hard not to think so when the book took such an abrupt turn for the worst."
5,Eye opener,"As times become troubled in this tiny corner of the world (or maybe hub of the world) we all start to think why do we have to go through all this? Isn't there a way out? So I sat and read the book and although the book told me, in so many ways, there is no light up the tunnel, at least now I know why... Although I know the Author for some 36 years, it did take a good book to finally clarify some of his words to me."
5,Awesome,Excellent series of BOOKS!!!!! Manfredi is the MAN!!!!Only he can truly portray the GREEK days with such detail. OUTSTANDING!!!
2,A Big Disappointment,"I bought this with the expectation that I would be rewarded with a lot of great performances but what I got was just bits and pieces of performances and lots of documentary. I was especially looking forward to seeing Brian Setzer perform, but there is next to nothing by him on this DVD... I want music, not jibber jabber!!! Don't waste your money."
1,disappointed,I was very disappointed the first time I used this. The foam roller is too soft and did not hold it's shape. I found that it couldn't not be used to work out knots and massage sore muscles because it became indented as soon as weight was applied to it.
4,A Keeper,"This is an wonderful addition to a music collection, each movement is superbly performed by Yo-Yo Ma. It is a must have for the Bach and cello lover. If you are only a mild to the unaccompanied cello, it may be best to go with another CD.This collection of suites is often compared to The Suites for Solo Cello Suites by J. Starker;in my opinion, it's a draw on which version of the unaccompanied cello is better. You can't go wrong with either."
5,Perfect performance,"This relaxing music makes me move from work to rest. It's really enjoyable when I am extremely tired. It turns my mindinto the wave of the Cello. All the trouble goes to my back.Surely, it's worth to collect."
5,Inspirational artistry matched by superb sound quality,"a wonderful combination of a great artist and a great recording.There are other artists that may match ma's playing, but the recording quality of this CD set makes it shine above the rest."
2,Yo-Yo Ma is just a youngster,"Although Mr. Ma may try to hit depths only found in Bach's time, I personally believe he lacks the true experience needed to play the renowned suites. I personally believe that the only way to truly experience such amazing 'cello music is through an amazing 'cellist, Mr. Pablo Casals. Only then can you really experience the beauty of a rarely noticed instrument playing a timeless classic.Mr. Ma stick to what you are good at, and let the professionals do the suites. ...."
1,Bogus recordings,"While these might be better than something you'd hear in a high school gym, they're hardly recommendable."
2,Better performances available,"Although some would call this performance ""straightforward,"" it lacks the depth and richness of available recordings by Fournier, Casals, and Rostropovich. Before purchasing, take the time to listen to the Suite No. 1 Prelude of all four cellists. Whereas Fournier, Casals, and Rostropovich are movingly expressive, Yo-Yo Ma's is ""on point"" but lacking emotion.I wanted to buy this CD but had no performer in mind. I first chose Yo-Yo Ma just because I'd heard of him. After a quick review of other customer comments and my own test runs, I decided to buy Fournier, Casals, AND Rostropovich, just because I was excited to hear a familiar piece played so beautifully in three different ways. Note that Yo-Yo Ma didn't make the cut."
2,Ho Hum.,"Remove the name ""Ma"" from this album, and you have just another mediocre recording of Bach's cello suites. The interpretation seems contrived, marred by awkward interruptions in rhythm and sentimentalized phrasing. A self-conscious performance that tries too hard and falls short."
5,Music for the Heart,"The experience of music doesn't get better than this, and rarely as good. The Bach cello suites take you into an inner space that most folks in this culture never visit, and Ma takes you there effortlessly, with nothing to separate you from this imperishable gift that Bach gave the world. Listen to it over and over again, and you will only grow deeper into this music. Mediate with it, and if you have animals in your life, play it for them and just watch what happens."
3,To much dependence on vibrato scarifices the music,"Yo Yo Ma is a great cellist, but this work was drowned in vibrato which made these ever so unique suites seem dull and repetative. I bought this recording for a friend and after hearing it I went out and bought her the Janos Starkes recording. (SEE MY REVIEW 5 STARS).I really liked the Soul of Tango Recording of Yo Yo Ma and I see him at least once a year in chicago. But this recording does not compare to Janos Starker."
1,Look out for leaks,"After installing a LTA pump and having it and the next 2 leak, I would check to see if the problem was fixed before ordering one. The folks at Plumbing Planet could not have provided any finer customer service (every business should be like them).The Hartell representative contacted me after my problem was solved by Plumbing Planet and said that they had a bad batch of pumps manufactured and were addressing the problem which should be solved by now, however I would check first. The pump was very easy to install, by the time I was done with my third I could do it in no time."
5,Pump works,The pump was exactly the kind we needed and it arrived promptly; more promptly than anticipated. It is now installed and working.
5,Works Hard for a Long Time,"I've live in an area with extremely high ground water and need a basement sink pump to pump drainage UP to city drainage levels. Furthermore, my air conditioner drains into the sink served by this pump. that means more work for the pump. I bought my first one of these, installed, for about $700 from a plumber it lasted 15 years, and I was satisfied.Got this one on Amazon for a little more than 1/3 the price of my first one. Identical, but with one key improvement: an included backflow valve. That means the pump doesn't operate nearly as often. I expect this one to last forever."
1,New design in works.,"I was told by the manufacturer that they have pulled this pump out of production and are redesigning it because the original design was defective. Evidently some pumps leak profusely as soon as you install them and others develop cracks and leaks soon after installation. Although that is a big problem, I have to say that their customer service was extremely responsive and a pleasure to deal with. I would advise waiting a month to order and making sure the vendor doesn't ship you one of the old stock."
4,laundry tub motor,this motor is very quiet and the instructions allows you to adjust the discharge volume.the motor was easy to install and works very well.I would recommend it to anyone who has to use an ejector motor to pump out the water used in washing clothes.
1,Whats the point?,"Eve though I'm a Spider-Man fan, this game isn't really that good at all.Edward Park"
5,Astounding,"Perahia's interpretation of the 'hunting horn' third movement of the Bb concerto (No. 15) is the closest thing to *perfect* Mozart on the piano that I've ever heard. Alive to every rhythmic nuance and shade of tone, everything sounds sponataneous and alive. His take on the first difficult cross-handed passage (which reappears later in the movement) is so personal and inevitable that it'll make your ears tingle for sheer joy. The ECO play with total commitment.The rest of the CD is extremely fine, as is the digital recording."
4,Excellent Accessory,"This is an excellent addition to my iPod Touch. I use it primarily in my car where my pod is connected to the aux input of the car's stereo. Power connects to the pod via this unit so keeping the pod charged in a non-issue. I use the remote (fob) to change/replay songs and adjust volume and it works great because I don't need to touch the pod at all. I've been recommending this gadget to my friends. It also works great outside the car and I've used it to listen music, again, without actually touching anything other than the fob.For those who are somewhat put-off by the appearance that this thing straps on to your steering wheel, you should know that it doesn't have to. you can use the remote independently. The remote (fob) is approximately 1 inch tall, 3/4 inch wide and 3/8 inch thick. It works great."
2,Awful range,"I purchased this for use in my car. I had planned on keeping my iPod in the glove compartment, and use this remote attached to the steering wheel to control it. This turned out to be almost impossible. The remote only works reliably around 2 ft away from the ipod, any further away and it will start ""missing"" commands.On the bright side, it was very easy to attach to the steering wheel."
2,Does not work with the pass through,"The product works but when I connect a charger to the pass through port, the remote ceases to work, rendering the product useless. I would not recommend the product to anybody else because of this."
5,Perfect iPod Remote!!,"I have a fourth generation iPod Nano and I recently got this remote for it. There's a lot of speculation over the distance of this device, but this remote actually does work up to 100 feet as advertised. Those who found the remote to only work up to 2 feet might not have a newer ipod. This is just an assumption. I know it works for the 4th gen for sure. In fact, it works perfectly. Through walls and ceilings, it doesn't matter. This device will be detected up to 100 feet.Also, I tested to have the iPod play for a bit and try the remote again. There was no delay and there was no need to ""wake"" it up before using it again!For anyone else out there who has this for a a different model iPod, please post up a review for others to know that it works."
5,Great Motorcycle Product,"I have this on my motorcycle handlebars, my iPod is attached to a handlemounted rack by use of an armband made to fit the iPod. Works as described, very easy to reach, buttons are easy to push and work as expected. I have NOT made use of the playlist button so I'm not sure of it's useablilty. I simply use it for ""play/pause"" and volume control when entering or exiting the freeway. I also have not tested it in bad weather conditions as it remains hot and sunny 90% of the year.Good job Scosche"
2,Works great until.....,"This remote worked just fine until I plugged an Apple Composite A/V Cable into the pass through slot.I use a Composite A/V Cable to plug into my car stereo and to charge my iPod classic while in the car. This remote didn't work with the cable plugged in. Worked fine without the cable, and when plugged into a regular sync cable for charging, even when placed into my iHome alarm clock; but plugging in the A/V cable caused the remote to stop working altogether."
4,Wanted safer control of iPod for my motorcycle,"This Scosche wireless remote works well to control my iPod while I'm out for a ride. Before I installed it, I was fumbling in my tank bag for the iPod scroll wheel - a dangerous maneuver with a gloved hand while moving through space at 75 mph. The remote gives me control right next to my left hand on the handlebars and the iPod remains secure - zipped inside the tank bag. The gloved hand is still a bit of a challenge given the small size of the remote, but it's doable. So far, vibration has not jostled the remote from its cradle. Thanks for a great product!"
2,Two of the seven buttons do not work,"I like the idea of the product. However, maybe I am missing something here, I could not get two of the seven buttons to work. They are the ""Play List Song Select"" and ""Play List Random"" buttons. I've read the manual and searched Scosche's website and could not find a solution.The basic functions of the other five buttons do work. These are the Volume Up and Down, Track Forward and Backward, and Pause/Play/Sleep buttons. However, I could not do ""press and hold"" to move forward or backward within a track. According to the manual these should work.Also, from my remote although I could put my iPod to sleep, I could not do the reverse action of waking it up."
5,Well Thought Out & Well Made,This product met my needs perfectly. The remote and receiver (the piece that's connected to my ipod touch) work great. I love that the remote's batteries are replaceable and that it can be taken out of the cradle that's attached to the steering wheel. And the amazing thing about the receiver is that it allows you to piggy back a power cord while it's attached to your ipod - great idea! I recommend this product without any reservations.
4,2 For the Price of 1 !!!,I have owned this remote for over a year now and shared the same headaches and disappointments as other reviewers as to it's inability to charge and operate when plug in with a car charger. I had written this device off as one more device that apple chose not to make compatible with it's many ipod models and was in search of another option.But nothing gave me the convenience of wireless control and simultaneous power charging! That is until I recently updated my iPod Touch with the latest 4G software and purchased The new Belkin Auto Charger for iPhone/iPod and now the remote operates seemlessly and charges with no problems. No more connecting the RF adaptor first and then the audio cable. Just plug and Play!!! All features work albeit your iPod must be already set for music and unlock the screen because the playlist function will not operate. This shopuld be of little concern since now the unit will be powered of the charger.
1,blotchy dye job,I followed the instruction on the label but the result was really blotchy with uneven patches of faded white . i dyed 2 white tshirts btw. A little disapointed but oh well I can wear the shirts to sleep.
2,Not unless your a total fan,"This is not a CD of songs - don't be fooled. This is a reading of an unauthorised biography and doesn't even use Evanescence as the background music. If you are a total fan and want something about the band, but not by the band, go ahead. I know I love the music and would not have purchased this if I knew it was not a music CD."
1,Doesn't look like this,It doesn't look like this in real life. It's smaller and looks gold not copper. I returned it. I'm still looking for something that actually looks like this.
5,Spode Christmas Tree Platters.,"Thanks for the good service Amazon for the prompt shipping service. They saved our Christmas!! We saved a bundle on price and shipping cost on three Spode Christmas Tree platters.They were beautiful and all that we expected. E Dillard, South Carolina"
5,The Perfect Christmas Present,This is the platter I was expecting and it is beautiful. It arrived faster than expected and will be on the table for Christmas. I was afraid of it being broken during shipment but it arrived safely with a minor dent in the box.
2,Made in CHINA!,"This is the same pattern I had hoped for, but it is all made in China now, not England or Germany as I had hoped. I guess you get what you pay for. Otherwise, it is a beautiful piece and I will use it each year."
2,It isn't that great,"I like my flat trays better, the sprouts grow so much better and can breath better too and become much greener and heather."
5,Works well. A smaller one would be usefull.,"It works well as a sprouter. The design is well thought out. You will get good results in you use the right amount of seeds and follow the rinsing scheduled. When in doubt use less seeds. They expand greatly as they sprout. The small seed inset can flip if you do a rinsing with a strong water supply. This item is larger then a quart jar. I would like to try one that was shorter and had a bigger base.I cook my sprouts withKoshihikari Premium Sprouted Brown Gaba Rice, 2.2-Pound Pouches (Pack of 2)and seasoning in aProgressive International Microwaveable 6-Cup (Cooked) Rice Cooker Set.I use 2 teaspoons of sprouted beans, 1/2 cup of Gaba rice, a little more then one cup of water and seasoning. I put it all in the rice container and let it sit for a hour. Then I put it in an 800 watt microwave and cook for 15 minutes at 70 percent power. When done cooking I let it sit for another hour."
4,Works good if you use the right amount of sprouts,"Follow the directions for how much of what kind of sprouts you are using. I sprout alf alfa all the time, and I've used under the recommended amount, and over, and they are either unhealthy and dry, or tiny and wet.. yuck. Use the recommended amount, and you'll get some good sprouts. I bought two of these to always have some ready. (rotating by 3 days apart)"
2,"Worked sometimes, but not always",This was a strange one. The seeds did not aerate as well as one might think. Tested more than twice and got minimal results {usually seeds were so soggy--EVEN WITH THE DRAINAGE HOLES AND FOLLOWING INSTRUCTIONS TO THE LETTER--and the yields were minimum. Ended up purchasing two sprout masters; they are GREAT. thx- MLA
2,Very disappointed,"I hate to say that I'm very disappointed with this product. I've been sprouting for years with just a 1/2 gallon glass jar, and screen lid. I watched the video on how to use this sprouter several times. I followed the video to the letter. I'm on the third try. First, even with the small seed insert, when rinsing and spinning the sprouter to get the water out, the small alfalfa seeds fly out in droves. Alfalfa comprises the bulk of my seed mixture. Even after they've been sprouting for several days I still lose several when rinsing and spinning.With my jar sprouts, I can usually keep them in a plastic bag for up to 2 weeks in the refrigerator. With this sprouter, when they're ready and I put them in the fridge, I'm lucky to have them last even a week before getting slimy and smelly.It's just too bad, because this looked like such a good and easy solution to sprouting."
1,a piece of trash,"This is actually horrible. I would have been better off buying a cheap plastic container and punching holes in it. It is awkward and messy. The lids don't fit correctly and my sprouts kept getting mushy instead of growing. I have been growing sprouts for over 30 years and wanted something neater than a ball jar and lid, but now I'm back to that and having great results. I'm throwing this thing in the trash!Easy Sprout Sprouter"
1,Not a Happy user,I used this product for couple of months. I bought it because it looked like a easy way to sprout seeds. But only 60-70% of my seeds sprout even after using high-quality germinating seeds and following their instructions. I was better off with my previous method of using a bowl/sieve to sprout where I was able to sprout 80-90% of my seeds.
3,E-Z if you know how,"The parts in this item are not clearly identified and the instructions are vague. Although it seems simple, you can't readily figure it out."
1,Mine Broke,Mine broke after about 100 minutes of use. The chord broke at the spot where it enters the handle after fraying cause by the rotation.
4,Jump rope,"This is my first jump rope and I'm quite satisfied with it. Size is adjustable. Handles are hollow plastic, but should last awhile."
1,Do not buy if you work out daily/ serious user,"Too bad this nylon rope wears out and tears apart at the handle after a solid week of half hour work sessions. the beads fly out all over once broken and I collected them up and sent for replacement. i liked the weighted feel, and it was VERY comfortable to jump and run-rope with. So I even tried a replacement rope of the same brand and it broke again in just a week. I requested and got a refund for the 2nd rope failure.DO NOT BUY THIS ROPE-it's fun and enjoyable to use UNTIL it breaks. The failure of the nylon rope makes this a waste of money. TOO BAD!!!"
1,Not as described at all.,"The box describes steel ball bearings AND the photo shows them too. But guess what ?........ there are NO meatal bearings at all. Therefore, the ""weight"" is absent and the actual length of this jump rope is only 8 ft. instead of 9 ft. Too short and lightweight for me to use at all. A disappointment."
1,Not as described,The description on Amazon website said that it was adjustable but when I received it there were no instructions to adjust it. I called the company and they said it wasn't adjustable so I had to return it.
3,Sturdy jump rope,I got this jump rope for my daughter and she loves it! Sturdy construction and good length for a single person.
4,Nice Jump Rope,"This is nice, but a little long. I love the weight though and adjusting the length isn't that hard to do.."
2,This thing isnt that great,It supposed to be 9 ft long and seems shorter I tried to make it longer but havent been able to untie the knowts becouse the beads are too tight.
1,Who built the pyramids?,"My six year old pointed out the following 'bold' statement by the authors of this book:""Many people think the work on the pyramids was done by slaves.This is not true."" p.81.No mention of slaves!Revisionist thinking?Certainly not the book I want my children learning from."
5,great,"This book is great for all ages.This 119 page book is filled with lots of information from everyday life to egyptian religion. this book talks about the pyramids, funerals,and the most famous mummy of all king Tutankhamun better known as king Tut. If you have children you should buy this book."
5,That cover is SO funny!!!,I started listening to this band because I saw them at the Ventura Theater and their cd is amazing! They are lucky enough to be born with a very rare Gene called 'the melody gene'. They come up with really really really good hooks to their songs and obviously they know this because they named the album 'embrace your hooks'. These guys will be huge.
1,Barbie inline Skates,My daughter had these but a few months before they started to come apart. the brackets that the straps insert into have come off and I had to drill a hole and use zip strips to hold them in place. Also the buckles for the straps have come up and I've had to repair them many times as well. Maybe for a 4 year old beginner but my 6 year old skater went through these to fast for the money. This time I'm going for a name brand!
4,pleasantly surprised,These are good beginner skates for a little one who has outgrown the adjustable shoe-in skates. The wheels have a lot of friction which is good for my fearful 4 year old. They are more comfortable than i thought they would be for her. They may not provide adequate performance for more experienced skaters.
4,A good read...,The author has done a great job. This book is full of obscure facts and some suprising opinions that will get the reader thinking. It has filled a void in the field and I recommend it without reservation.
5,Invitation To Eavesdrop,"This masterful singer-songwriter shares his dreams, hopes, fears, and failings on 10 emotionally honest, uplifting and exciting modern worship songs. From the open exploration of personal weakness in the hit ""Welcome Home"" to the heartfelt praise of ""Your Renown"" and ""Abba Father"", Shaun Groves raises the bar for all of CCM with this amazing album."
2,"Great sound, flimsy cord","These worked great for me for about a month. I was amazed at how much sound was blocked out--I was able to listen to my Sansa at about half the volume as with my old headphones. The reason for the two stars is that the wires lost connection right where the Tune Buds plug into the MP3 player after just a month of use. The cords really do seem terribly thin, and there is no stress reliever at the point where the wires lost connection. It's a pity, because this is otherwise a great product.By-the-way, Amazon was great about the problem. I just missed the return period, and I sent them an e-mail explaining the problem. They graciously agreed to take them back and give me a refund (although I'm still waiting for the refund, but I just sent them earlier this week.)"
3,The picture indicated a different item :(,The picture indicated a long and short length for the two earbud wires which is easier to use around the back of my neck. That keeps the wires from getting in my way. The wires are the same length and I cannot put a longer wire behind my neck :(
3,"Great sound, but poor durability","I bought these headphones 3 months ago and was initially impressed. There was considerably good sound quality for the price and they were comfortable. However, I noticed recently that the rubber coating of the wire wears too easily. From just wrapping it around my iPod gently, the headphone jack has bits of exposed wire, and for some reason the same thing has happened near the earbuds. I suggest buying a better pair for a higher price rather than spending money on these and having to buy new ones."
3,"ok, but not great","I bought these a couple of months back because they were on sale. I wanted something that kept the noise away better than the stock iPod ear buds. These do keep away the noise, but the sound that they produce is very lacking. They sound very tinny to me with very boomy bass both overpowering any midrange. I know it's not a one-off issue since I also purchased a set for my wife (she's fine with them -- she's not picky at all about sound). I eventually purchased a pair of Sennheiser CX300 which were about twice the price, but 10x the sound quality.Now, if only I could find a pair of in ear headphones that wouldn't transmit the cable sounds!"
1,No lows!!!! Terrible sound!,"I expected these to be pretty good based on the other reviews. There were plenty of highs, but NO LOWS at all! Absolutely no bass. I was really disappointed -- assume they were defective since everyone else seems to think these are decent. At least Amazon let me send them back and refunded my money. Yay Amazon!"
1,the lines are old and useless,its a shame that the book is useless. it starts out great but so many moves are left out that u can't even play them. I guess thats what is to be expected with opening books the theory keeps upgrading and the book remains the same. Dont waste your money like i did.
2,Giant Bubble Wand,This bubble wand can be messy but it is worth it! The bubble sop may run out fast! I loove this toy! It keeps me and my brothers occupied. I hope you have just as much fun as I did with this toy! Enjoy!
1,Very Dissapointed 2 year old,I got this for my son last year because he loves bubbles ... It really looks cool because kids can play 3 muskateers or fencing games the bubbles go in the sheath and the stick comes out like a sword...Well it only made a few good bubbles and the rest of them just popped before reaching large size... Needless to say my son was very disappointed and so was I... I would not recommend spending the money on this item...
1,lack of tracks,One star! beacuse there are no tracks... One does not have the time to listen to a whole act or is willing to when using a CD... so this CD becomes one of those forgotten on the shelf! What a pity.
5,Simply awesome,The best recording of this lesser-known opera that exists. Kiri Te Kanawa and Domingo produce some magestically moving duets and her arias are awe-ispiringly fine.
4,Adequacy,"An adquate game guide for an average GNC game. The guide is actually very helpful. There always times in game play when one becomes stuck, so a game guide is useful."
3,Like the game... not as i wish...,"At first i'll say i'm Italian so my english could be not so good to understand!!!I hoped to find a book such complete as the edition released for the first pokèmon series games, i know that pokèmon repeates itself for many thing like moves, items and many other things so yes you'll find it all in the guide.But as you find so many picture and a near complete walkthrough, the book lack in strategies for the most important battle and for the solution of the 50 battle cd!!!You want to do a STRATEGY GUIDE so write it COMPLETE!!!!Buy it if you are a collector if not leave where it is...."
5,Its not all about recognition,"What I liked about this book was that it makes a point to people that are concerned with being seen. Its not all about everyone seeing who you are and that you are a part of ______Church. To often in our contemporary christian climate we do ""good works"" but we want to make sure that people see us doing them. This book points out that that is not the point of good works. Rather, they focus on what your church is doing, and why is it doing it. More importantly it asks what are you asking of your members. Commitment isn't about wearing the t-shirt, embroidered polo, baseball cap, etc. with your church name. Commitment is about a deep abiding love of God that is shown in who we are."
4,Ideas For Being Externally Focused,"I agree with the premise of this book. The church is to be externally focused. This book offers many real life examples for churches & church members. It's practical & inspiring. I found myself wanting to go out & get started! I'm not in church leadership, but I feel that I've gained insight, perspective & some ideas on how to help the church, any church, be externally focused."
5,Practical and on target,Good book. Right on target in describing where the church needs to be going. Lots of examples; practical.A Call to Arms! Out of the Pews and Into the Streets
5,cheap and work,"installed these on a 98 subaru impreza, they were cheap and seem to do the job! very quiet, you do not hear any operation of the strut as compared to the monroes which let out an audible atmospheric sound when compressing"
4,A wonderful first aquarium,"My daughter received this item for Christmas of 2000 and ithas held up very well. It is just now getting a little bit wornand we are thinkin that we should replace it soon. My daughteris an aspiring marine biologist and has found observing hervery own fish absolutely fascinating. She started off with 2 goldfish, but 1 died within the first week. We then went back to thepet store and got a good filter, which has done wonders as faras keeping it clean and keeping our remaining goldfish happy andhealthy.He's been around for over 2 years with no problems!I think that this is an excellent product and a great introductionto having a first pet. So much more fun than an ordinarygoldfish bowl! It is only large enough for 1 or 2 small fish,so keep that in mind before buying!"
4,Fancy Goldfish Bowl,"You are very limited to the kind of fish due to there being no heater, filtration system, or lights with this. In fact we were told at the pet store that we could only get goldfish or a betta.We were a little disappointed at that especially since they don't last as long as other fish. We also were told to add 2"" of stones to the bottom which covers up all the fancies at the bottom. Expect about a 15 - 20$ expense in food, fish, water chemicals, stones, etc.Even so we are enjoying our fish and are inspired to get a ""real"" aquarium or when these fish are gone. We may take the bowl into the pet store and see if we can attach a heater and such.We are learning a lot through observation and about pet care, responsibilty, and just plain fun. Exciting for any age but especially first time pet/fish owners."
1,Save money buy a 20 gal tank,I have been an aquarium enthusiast for a while and whenever I see things like this it drives me crazy. Anything smaller than a 20 or 30 gal tank is a waste of money. Anything smaller than that is difficult to sustain. It would be very disappointing to your child in the long run to buy this. Go buy the real thing!
2,Picture looks better than the real thing,We purchased this for our nephew who loves fish and thought this would be neat to see inside. Well it was a lot different than the pic shows..1. a lot smaller 2. the scope was not very well made so kids could not see well inside. 3. it was cheapy made & looking. The price was not bad considering but lets just say they used it for only a few months and now it is in the garage.
4,GOLDFISH TANK,WELL GOLDFISH GROW LARGER IN A POND THAN THEY DO IN A TANKAND THEY GET BETTER COLORING TOO.in a tank they get about5 inches long.(but this is a better guppy or betta tank because of its size).
4,"""EM2"" YOU ARE WRONG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",GOLDIFISH COULD NOT LIVE IN THIS TANK BUT....THEY CAN BE HOUSED IN A 10 GALLON TANK ANDTHAT WOULD BE FOR ABOUT 4 FISH. BECAUSE IF YOU WERE TOUSE 10 GALLONS PER GOLDFISH AND YOU HAD 5 FISHTHAT WOULD MEAN YOU WOULD NEED A 50 GALLON TANKWICH YOU DO NOT.BUT I DO HAVE TO AGREETHAT THIS IS MORE OF A BETTA FISH TANKBECAUSE OF ITS SMALL SIZE (1.5 gallons).
5,Fine Item,"This item was received in fine condition.The book was very good, if you would like to learn something about foosball :)"
3,Good but not great.,"I've had these bulbs for about 2 years now and most everything written here is true. A bunch of mine were DOA or failed within a few days (about 10-20%). When they work they are great, nice and bright. When they dim beyond a certain range they buzz. And now that I have used them for 2 years, I have had about 50% fail well before their rated useful life. All of that said, they are still half the price of the home depot CFLs which don't dim, so I figure that it's a wash even with the premature failures. I'm ordering extra this time."
2,Save money but put up with flicker,"These bulbs are unique in that they are dimmable. Most CF bulbs cannot be hooked up to a dimming circuit. While this feature is good, keep in mind, they will flicker like crazy when they are not on full power. Also, they have a tendency to hum. I also got a bad bulb in my 4-pack, which only lasted a week."
1,Cause I can't get to 0 stars,"Bought several of these. All failed within 6 mos. Thats all I can say about them, they just don't dim..but then have not found a 'diimablel cfl that did not fail quickly."
3,Every Piece of one of the 20th C's Great Artists Important,"I had already seen a documentary about this case on the History Channel. When I viewed Welles' version for the first time it made me realize something I already knew: genius is also a wonderful aid when simply confronting reality (documentary). In the History Channel version, you are left with the impression that the crazy peasants just went off their rockers. Welles zeroes in on a crucial detail: one of the idiot sons undammed water and forgot about it, flooding the property. The old man paced around convinced ruin was upon him. The shots of him wondering what was going to happen to the land at the end, in a psychotic daze complete the picture. Too bad Welles didn't make about a hundred movies like this. This is a fascinating vignette; almost like finding a set of characters from a Zola novel, still alive in the 20th C, facing the end of the line."
1,Didn't work,I purchased this product to remove an ink stain from the sleeve of one of my husband's dress shirts. I followed the instructions on the label. It did not work.
5,Fantastic Stuff,"Soilove is great for all stains. With a family of 6, I've used it on everything and it always takes out the stains! Great stuff!"
5,so love it,i love this product i too live on the east coast and can not buy it locally please think about stocking itthanks
5,Nothing on the market ist better than this!,"This product is amazing. Lived in CA all my life & moved to NC. Brought about 50 bottles with me 'cause NC doesn't sell this. Was ecstatic to find it on the internet for about 80 cents & can finally let my daughters have some of my precious stockpile. They don't advertise - strictly by word of mouth & it is the BEST kept secret. Many are hesitant to buy it in the store because it's so cheap - figure if it's not expensive it must not work. Soilove removes old set in stains that have been in for years & dried on(old baby clothes, formula, grime, etc.) Have never found a cloth that it is harmful to. Goes on like water so it seems like it won't work, but just completely wet the stain, wash it in hot, cold or warm & voila it is amazingly gone. Some stains are extra tough, so I soak first then may rub a stain stick on it - but always soak (& by this I mean completely wet it)it first."
5,Soilove is GREAT,"We discovered Soilove through Mary Hunt's column, and it is wonderful! My husband is in HVAC, and it takes care of all of his oil and whatever else stains the first washing. I highly recommend Soilove!"
4,Best on the market--with a caveat,"I discovered Soilove in 1983. I was looking for something to remove large grease spots from clothing. I've been using it ever since. This stuff does exactly what it is said to do: takes out grease (may require two washings), red wine, gravy, what-have-you. It was a buck a bottle when I started buying it; now it's up to a buck-eighty and still a bargain. I buy several bottles at a time because you kinda need to use a lot.Just one thing. Guys, would it kill you to use a bottle that doesn't leak all over the place? I'd happily pay the extra ten cents!"
5,Miracle Stain Remover,"Before leaving the US for three weeks, my husband spilled a great deal of red wine in his white dress shirt. We had to leave the shirt in the trunk of the car for all of those 21 days. When we returned I washed that shirt after treating it with Soilove. All of the stains came out and there was not a trace of the red wine that had soaked into the fabric for many days."
5,All these review are true!,I've used this product several times and every review posted here is true. It works as advertised and does no damage to the fabric. It's the best stain remover I've ever come across.
3,Doesn't say a whole lot.,"I got the book so I could improve my photography skills for a online jewelry business. I learned a little about paying attention to shadows, but overall I didn't get a whole lot out of this book."
2,Fair,I didn't dislike anything...It was just not a good product. Basically nothing useful in it for Ebay or Etsy. Better books out there.
4,The Silk Vandetta,"The two main characters in The Silk Vandetta by Victoria Holt are Lenore and her grandmother. They spent all their lives together. They were the only real family they had. One incident that made me really like the book was when Lenore's grandmother found Lenore's father. Lenore then met her father for the first time in her life. When her father found out that she wanted to open a branch of her clothing shop in Paris but she and her grandmother didn't have the money to do it, her father offered to pay for all the expences. At first her pride kept her from letting him pay. But after time her grandmother and sister-in-law wore her down. She then accepted the money from her father so that she could live out her dream. This book took me in from the first page. I love the discription. The scenes it describes seem to jump off the page and into reality. The charcters are so lovable and real. I highly recommend this book to anyone who loves romance and suspence."
1,Am I the only one who thinks this book is crap?,"This is the first V. Holt book I've read and I might not make it all the way through. It's colossally stupid and I get the impression that the author read a few paragraphs about silk somewhere and tried to make it fly as a plot. It could have been a good plot but the characters and situations are so far from authentic, the dialogue is awkward and often pointless, and the plot is beyond predictable. The one good thing about this book is that it is so massively amateurish yet obviously popular that I think I might just have a career in writing romance novels. They couldn't be any worse than this. I'm going to give another Holt book a try just in case this one is an awful fluke."
3,This is a fairly good book.,I have read better but no doubt its a good way to learn how to become a taxidermiest.
5,Truly an effectice program,"I can say in all honesty I have battled my weight and low level of fitness my entire life. I have been in every organized program, tried every diet and supplement, prescription or otherwise, and I have never been successful. Until now, when this book showed me the missing factor in all of it: God. In her book, the author leads you to see how fruitless it is to seek such life changes without the Lord. I find His strength pulling me in all the right directions now, and I feel this author has been truly inspired to help everyone."
2,Not impressed with this book,Doesnt tell anything I didnt already know.Has some pictures of stretches.Kinda a waste of money.......sor-ry!
1,Just another way to make money out of your religion,"As a christian man, I think, making money out of your religion in a way other religions do, is the wrong way.Christian people should help other people to understand the sacrifice Jesus Christ made for us and not how to get fitter through your religion. This review is ment for all books like this one and people, who read or write this books should think about their believe, do you really think you are on the right way?"
5,Great book at a great price,It is what I expected it to be at a very great and affordable price! Love the stories and the explanation of each section of the Pathfinder's Law and Pledge.
4,keeps pets cool,"Now that Summer is here, I resort to this Cool-It Bandana for my dear Westie. This product really works and will keep your dog cool. The only thing I learned when I purchased my first one is to NOT put it in the freezer. It does swell when it cools and adds weight for the dog, otherwise, it's terrific!"
4,Get it for She Wore a Yellow Ribbon if nothing else,"Nice, bargain priced collection of John Ford. She Wore a Yellow Ribbon has some of his best cinematography (up there with The Searchers and Cheyenne Autumn) and one of John Wayne's greatest performances. Wagon Master is another solid Ford (supposedly one of his personal favorites), that gives his usual cast (Harey Cary, Ward Bond, Joanne Dru, Ben Johnson, et al) a chance to shine on their own. Anyway it's a pretty good collection for the money."
4,Enjoy it still today,"Soft gum in a roll dispenser. Doesn't get hard fast and keeps it's flavor quite a while. Good for road side sale, fair or flea market stalls. Kids will get it even if they aren't old enough to remember it's popularity in the 90's."
4,Works as it should.,"Don't know what more to say about this - fit right in the Weller soldering iron, heated right up, worked well. Recommended."
3,Would rate higher if the price was better,OK an excellent choice just not at this price. I would have rated higher if the price was more competitive
2,THIS IS NOT A MUSIC CD IT IS A AUDIO BIOGRAPHY,"Lots of good info on all members of both Operation Ivy and Rancid but do not be deceived as I was into thinking this contained unreleased Rancid music. I does not even have interviews with the bad, just a British lady reading their unauthorized bio."
1,shipped part did not include y pipe,"The part that was shipped did not include the y pipe pictured, only the catalytic converter."
1,Not worth the money!,"I own over 750 karaoke songs and the three karaoke ""Chartbuster 70`s karaoke disk"" are the worst I have heard. The backround music is very poor as though they were copied many times. I have a very good Player and most all my disk play and sound very well so it is not my Machine. These disk are awful.I bought a Big & Rich/ Toby Keith Karaoke at Amazon and it plays great."
5,A good book-but a condensation of three previous books.,"Buyers should be aware that this is merely a condensation of Dr. Wink's three previous larger works on the subject, and not a new vilume in that series. Its usefulness will thus be restricted to those who have not read his excellent books previously."
4,"Insightful and powerful, even if some might disagree with his theological conclusions","A previous review spoke highly of Wink's book, with the caveat that the reviewer wasn't impressed with certain aspects of Wink's theology. I'd agree. Even though I disagree with Wink's uderstanding of the atonement and God's soveriegnty, I recognize that there is something powerful and important coming across in this work. His exploration of the ""Powers"" behind the plethora of the world's systems and casting these in light of ancient understandings of angels provides a powerful context for Christian prayer and interaction with these ""Powers.""Perhaps his greatest contribution in this book is to the concept of Christian, non-violent action. Many of the more popular speakers and authors (like Claiborne, Bell, and others) seem to draw a great deal from what he writes. Wether you agree with his conclusions or not, I believe his is an important piece in the developing scene of popular theology today."
5,Non-Violence at it's best,"This book is amazing. If you haven't read it . . . you need to soon. Although have patience sorting through the first 2 chapters as it takes time to build Wink's case for a creative 3rd way of non-violence. The book is rather short and focuses on Walter Wink's thoughts on ""the powers that be"" in our world. And how we are to creatively oppose them through non-violent means. It was like a drink of fresh water after watching, reading, hearing, and seeing what Washington deems to be the best possible solution to violence . . . namely more violence. Wink put into words so much of what I've been thinking over the past few months. And gave me hope that while it is truly a difficult and apparently non-realistic way to engage in conflict . . . it is in fact way easier and extremely realistic when seen from the perspective of the crucified Christ."
3,Not very impressive,"Mr. Wink makes some interesting points in this book, but I found it flawed. While his ideology seems similar to my own, he seems rather selective in his use of scripture. I don't expect a biblical scholar to pick and choose in deciding what's relevant, putting enough spin on a verse to make it match the viewpoint of the one reading it. Wink does plenty of that, and at times seems to read the bible to defend his opinion rather than reading it as a way to formulate opinion. He makes a number of good points but I can't wholeheartedly recommend this book."
5,U.S. government vs. the American people,"This excellent documentary leaves little doubt that the American government has metastasized into a monster that swallows up the property, liberty, and lives of its subjects. The America of Madison and Jefferson has been replaced by a militarized menace which permits ever diminishing dissent. As the film shows, there is no recourse to elected officials, and the news media are shills for government authority. In the aftermath of 9/11 government power has been further concentrated and militarized. It has happened here."
3,Thought-provoking documentary,"I'd seen this movie before, but wanted it on DVD. It's one of those interesting documentaries that make you wonder what really happened. I took most of their ""facts"" with a grain of salt. Though I think the movie raises enough questions to make you want to check into it further. The filmed government hearings alone are enough to make you want to know more. So it's worth watching, just to get somebody else's view of what happened."
4,Tendentious but unforgettable,"First, the flaws. The (very dramatic)FLIR section--purporting to show that the Davidian compound was fired upon by the government's forces during the catastrophic fire--has been shown to be meritless. Interviews and testimony have been edited so as in some cases to misrepresent the opinions of those shown and quoted. The dishonesty, incompetence, and venality of the US government and its agencies in this ghastly, sickening tragedy are glaring enough that there's no need to distort the truth in order to get the point across.Nonetheless, what happened to the Davidians was so horrible, and this film is so powerfully made, that it will haunt you."
3,This same corrupt government...,"Has killed alot more people in Iraq than Waco. Ours and theirs all for some made up excuse about ""Weapons of Mass Destuction"" and Religous Zealots. Sound familiar? The only problem the war is taking us down a terrible path."
1,What A Crock,"This video makes masterful use of inuendo and manipulation, a truly excellent propaganda piece. Unfortunately, this work by people I have no reason to rely upon contradicts the evidence uncovered by Congress (although they quote selected segments out of context), and the evidence (even the negative evidence) reported by the Treasury Department. The Justice Department, unfortunately, whitewashed the FBI's actions with a ""nobody did anything wrong"" report. Nevertheless, the contrast between evidence supported by facts, and the slanted foolishness of this video, is astonishing. Having read some of the reviews by the video's makers and that odd assortment of flat-earth conspiracy freaks, I'm tempted to sell them tickets on the moon bus leaving next month. I'd make a fortune :-)"
5,Lies liars lie,"Above all, this film demonstrates that the US is not in danger of becoming a terroristic police state. It already is one."
5,A WAKE UP CALL FOR ALL AMERICANS..,"After viewing this video I was upset at what the ATF and FBI had done to the people inside that building. It wasn't a compound. Just a wooden building. Using the military against women and children! Shooting CS gas into a building where kids are present! Sen. Charles Schumer's remarks during the hearings were so arrogant and one sided he should have been gagged. More recent developments in the Waco case have proven several points made in this tape. Sadly (for us) they show the FBI and ATF lied about what really happened. After watching this tape,you may not feel so secure anymore."
1,Slander,"This documentary contains the infamous FLIR allegations that claim Federal Agents massacred Davidians as they tried to exit the compound. However, with the work of expert Ian William Goddard and the Maryland Advanced Development Laboratory (among others) conclusively showed that the FLIR ""gunshots"" were actually reflections of the thermal exhaust of the tank. This, along with the coroner reports (in public domain) of the Davidians show that they all died behind a brick wall with single shots to the head. This was ruled as suicide, seeing as how it would be impossible for Federal agents to fire through a brick wall and hit each of them in the head without missing a single shot.Thus, this documentary is slander against the US government and lies about the tragic fate of the Branch Davidians."
1,Need I even.....,Need I even write a review for this piece of trash? You people have problems if you are seriously thinking about buying this.
5,Blessed are the Prophets,"This is just an example of how ""religious fundementals"" of any kind are persecuted by our corrupt government. This film exposes the dark side of our ""big brother"" government. I say this is a must see for ANYONE who resides in this country. May the spirit of the lord keep all those who perished at the hands of Evil. Although I do not agree with all of the teachings of brother Koresh, may he be blessed, for standing for the lord and not giving in to politics! ""Blessed are the prophets""."
5,"Shocking, revealing...",Should be required viewing for all concerned citizens. What is the role of government? To murder its own citizens? Apparently.
2,NOT an all region DVD,"The DVD itself is a great purchase, but only if you are able to watch Region 2 (Europe) DVDs. It's described here as an All Region DVD, but I can't watch it on my regular DVD player. I have a portable DVD player from Switzerland, and using that is the only way I can watch this DVD. I was very disappointed that Amazon lists this as All Region, since I wanted to watch this on my big screen tv; unfortunately it seems like I'm stuck watching it on a 7 inch display on my lap. Better than nothing, I guess."
1,Terrible construction and spread control,This product is so poorly made you thought it was made in China 25 years ago when they just started manufacturing. Used it 3 times after I had to modify it myself out of the box. I'm throwing it away with recycling material so maybe it can be turned into something useful like carpet padding.
4,DS1000DGY Economy Drop Spreader,"It was the item that I wanted, and was delivered in an acceptable manner. Thanks"
5,Hero Factory the Best!!,My grandson absolutely loves Hero Factory.. Great animation. Wish the story line would continue.. Was so glad to find it on DVD since I lost the recording on my DVR.
3,Its No Bionicle,I bought this because of the high quality animation and great story of the Bionicle films that it resembles. Though the characters look similar the story sucks. It is so superficial that despite the cool animation I was baffled about how they canceled Bionicle for this. PLEASE LEGO!! BRING BACK BIONICLE. How could you destroy the great story and keep the same type of robots? This film is worth watching but remember IT IS NOT BIONICLE SO DON'T GET YOUR HOPES UP!! Maybye Lego will come to their sences and bring Bionicle back but I doubt it. I'd sign a petition. Judge for yourself!!
3,bandolino,"i tried this one on and it looked great all except it was too big, had to give it away my heart was sore cuz i love the shoe. ill have to get one a size smaller. it looks great , i got exactly what was on the website."
4,David Hockney: A Bigger Picture,"I've watched this dvd 3 or 4 times since buying it last year. It follows Hockney at a gentle pace as he shows his approach to painting. Many of his later paintings made during the trip to England when this film was made are simply beautiful and the film itself is beautifully shot. Hockney the man was not so inspiring. The more I watched it, the less I liked him. He speaks quietly but you get the impression that wherever he is, it's his way or the highway. It was not explicit in the film but it seems his elderly sister had to hit the highway when he got back home. But I guess the artist cannot be separated from the art. All of it, personality, eye, skill, is necessary to make the career and it was helpful to see how art careers are maintained."
3,under-titles required!,This program is very well designed and very interesting.But it is bad luck for french readers... no french under-titles!
4,Most Interesting Reading,"This bit of American history was unknown to me until I read this book. That alone made it worthwhile. Why it remains under-reported is unclear, but anyone who wants to expand their knowledge of the Civil War beyond the Ken Burns basics should grab this book.Especially interesting were the descriptions of living conditions in New York, the rabble-rousing, solicitous nature of democratic politicians and the history of urban violence. Many will find irony in the fact that at that time, the Republican party was considered socially liberal and had the support on New York's newspapers.The only fault I can find with this book is its sometime tedious treatment of minor events and details of the week-long riot. The reader can easily fix that by skipping pages and quickly get caught up in the flow of events. The immensity of detail makes that easy."
1,Waste of Money,This product is an overpriced box of sugar and food coloring. The same effect can be achieved cheaper by using 1 part sugar to 4 parts water and not using red food coloring. Hummingbirds will be sufficiently attracted to the feeder without the food coloring.
5,Good Stuff,"This is great nectar. It mixes smoothly, and forms a nice bright, attractive liquid that does a good job atracting hummingbirds. The powder comes in a heavy plastic bag that is good for closing it up between feedings."
1,May be harming the hummingbirds,"Feeding them sugar and water may be insufficient. One manufacturer of nectar says that such food does not contain the vitamins, minerals and liquid organic compounds necessary for hummingbird diets. Good intentions and enjoyment derived from feeding the simple nectar may be shortening the life-span of the birds.If anyone knows more about this, please post a review, thanks. Tgrnry"
4,Armitage At His Best!,"This disc truly captures the wit and wisdom of one of America's premier perennial gardeners, Dr. Allan Armitage of the University of Georgia.

2,the great Mass,"I bought this DVD expecting too much. I miss bach throughout the performance. The chorus seem to be training not performing. The solemnity of the composition isn't there. The sound quality could be much much better. And where's the conductor by the way??The bottom line, this DVD is too pricey for what it offers and I do recommend watching other versions for any serious Bach lovers. I was rather disappointed."
5,A great performance,"If you love Bach you will love this performance. Visually excellent, with some echo but not disruptive. Listen to the bass Klaus Mertons, he is just the best there is. If Bach can hear him he is happy too. The cantor, the choir, the orchestra were all outstanding. By the time the performance was over my heart was pounding with excitement."
1,Poor performance,"I bought the DVD from Amazon.de and, as I also own the Philippe Herreweghe's version, I must say that the Leipzig version by Christopher Biller is, by comparison, extremely disappointing. The recording is of so bad quality that it is diffult to say who is to blame between the recording and the performers. The concert is only partly saved by the very promising alto mathias Rexroth."
1,Poor performance,I agree with the other one star ratings. The soloists were probably amateur. They are too low quality to be paid. There is only one woman in the entire performance. She is the soprano. The alto soloists are men. The soprano and alto parts in the choir were sung by the boys choir. I think I will either throw it away or give to the library. This is not worth keeping.
5,One of the best DE albums,"If you like rockabilly and good twanging, play it loud and wake the neighbors up. If they don't come out dancing it won't be your fault! My favorite DE album and still great after all these years."
4,One of the best albums you've never heard of,"So excited to have found this hard to find golden oldie for only $8 through the Internet.One of those recordings that has nary a throw away tune, although 'Me and the Boys' comes close. The rest of DE7th is top notch rockabilly and certainly Edmunds' best recording. 'Deep in the Heart of Texas' and the piano ballad 'One More Night' are my favorites. Snatch this up, if you can find it, and decide which ones are yours!"
4,Great Value,"We have just purchased a new CA King mattress and I wanted to make sure it was protected. I searched all over online for a mattress pad and finally decided to take a chance on this one. Our mattress is a pillowtop and is nice and soft. I personally like this product, but my husband seems to think it's taking away from the softness of our new mattress. I have opted to leave it on for a while to see if he either ""forgets"" about it or it breaks in a little more. If he opts to remove it, that's fine - it's a great product and well worth the money - I vote to keep it !!! This pad fits fine over a deep mattress, although it took just a little effort to get it over the mattress - but it hasn't come off at all. I would recommend this product."
1,Poor quality,The side ripped putting it on for the first time. The label did not have a company name on it and the package didn't have a label with the company name on it. I think it was a rip-off. Next time I'll buy in the store.
4,Beautiful Pad!!,"I did alot of research before buying this mattress pad. I looked at so many because I am very particular about what goes on my mattress. This pad looks beautiful, and does not add any significant bulk to the mattress. I didn't want bulk interfering with the comfort of my mattress. It's really nice and very well-made. The price and quality is better than most department stores. I can't comment on washability yet because I just got it, but many others claim that it washes beautifully. That was also another concern of mine because so many other pads shrink or come apart in the washer and/or dryer. It feels nice, looks great! Trust me on this one! Buy it! I love it!"
2,Croscill Pima Cotton Stripe Mattress Pad,"At first I thought this would be a nice mattress pad. Everything was fine, except when I put it on the mattress, my finger went right through the elastic on the side. It was paper thin. I do not have long fingernails to poke through either. I was so disappointed. The rest of the pad seems good. If you purchase this pad, just be careful of the sides."
1,certainly isn't what the reviews said,"I am so very disappointed in this item, I haven't had this Mattress Pad on my bed for less then 2 months,and the sides of the pad are already ripping. I have about 4 of the already. They are ripping right down the elastic seam. Having a hard time trying to figure out how I can return for a full refund. I don't maybe someone can help me."
1,The sides just tore apart,"This mattress pad looked great coming out of the box. When I tried to put it on for the first time, the skirt just tore apart. The skirt seemed to be made of tissue paper. My wife and I couldn't believe how the skirt just seemed to disintegrate when we stretched it to put it on our Cal Kind mattress. Unbelievably disappointed."
4,Croscill Pima Cotton stripe mattress pad,Love the way it fits on the mattress. Would like to buy more in the future for the other beds in the house.
5,Thick and Comfortable,"This is a rather hefty pad that fits well on the extra-deep mattress that we just purchased. Since I launder the mattress pad frequently, I put our old mattress pad on top of the new one, because it can be washed in my home machine. The new one will have to go to a laundromat with super-capacity machines."
2,Side construction is flimsy,"A discussion thread from 2007 claims that the skirt is made of cotton, and not ""that horrible stuff that melts and tears in the dryer"". But not the one I got yesterday. Or if it is cotton, it's tissue-fragile cotton, and it tore while I was putting it on. I'm not a surgeon, but I'm not clumsy. The skirt is way too flimsy. It's magnitudes flimsier than the skirt on the cheap old pad this is replacing. Did I get a bad one? Nobody else I've seen has made this non-dryer-related complaint, after all. I don't know. I duct-taped mine up and will try to go with it. But while the rest of the thing seems pretty darn good, this is unacceptable. At any rate--be very careful putting it on the mattress."
1,Bad Flash BEWARE,"I too had the issue of not getting good light.. ANY light out of this flash. I would do better holding a flash light over my head. In fact.. a Lighter would do too. It was my first External flash unit, so I thought maybe I just wasn't using it. I'm thinking that it might not be designed to work on DIGITAL cams. I have Canon 30D. I guess you get what you pay for. A good starter flash would be the Canon 430 ex. The 580 ex II is a better flash ( more light output, more features.) I have both now. The 430 is my back-up flash. Good units. Spend the $$. U'll be glad you did."
4,A useful Book!,"This is a useful book for the non-American people, like me, to learn how American use these daily phrases. The Phrases showed on this book can be heard every day and have high frequencies. I really like this book. It helps me understant what my American classmates talk and the speech which my professor addressed in the classroom."
4,A step into Fairyland,"I first had to read Phantastes for a college English class, but i've since reread it dozens of times for my own enjoyment. MacDonald virtually transports the reader into the mind and heart of Anados (the main character) as he journeys through Fairyland. Here, Fairyland is a deeply dreamlike, sometimes nightmarish place where everything and everyone has a signifigance far beyond the surface. For me, the best part of this story is the fact that one can read it as a simple adventure or as a spiritual journey. The allegorical aspects of Phantastes are everpresent, though not blatant. MacDonald's flowery, Victorian prose allows the reader to draw only as much from Phantastes as he would like to get. However, if you read this, it will probably suck you right into the heart of the story. If you are looking for a dark, rich fantasy, this is the original..."
2,Disappointing edition,"If you didn't read the preface to this edition, or you weren't shopping for an illustrated copy of McDonald's wonderfully engrossing story, perhaps you wouldn't know what you were missing.Sadly, I did both. The ONLY illustration in this book is on the cover. McDonald's son wrote the preface (to the 1905 edition, bewilderingly included in this version), and made pointed mention of the fact that illustrations had been added in by McDonald's good friend.However, illustrations are nowhere to be seen in the pages of the book.I am VERY curious to know if there are any editions out there that have illustrations throughout. I would love to read the version that this preface accurately accompanied. That being said, the story is fantastic thus far, and I certainly am not disappointed with the author's content.This is not the edition you want to own!"
2,Margins too narrow hard to read near binding edge,"This is a great story by George MacDonald but if you want an easy to read large print, look for another edition. First it's a wide format paperpack (I should have checked the dimensions). But worse than that, the margins are too narrow sothat it's difficult to open the book wide enough to read the text near the bound edge of the pages."
4,perahia does in once again,perahia is one of my favorite pianist. it is a shame he did not records all 3 sonatas. they are avilable on Harmonia mundi (Chiu) and on Koch international (Dana Protopopescu -all 3 sonatas on Koch international for less than $. Out of print but maybe can find used). All in all these are lovely examples of early mendelssohn. If you are a fan of perahia this is a good cd to own.
4,I love Denki!,"I first heard this CD when I was 16 yr old, and I found it on Amazon, I couldn't resist.I still like it a lot and their lyrics makes me laugh."
3,Cracked cover,"The cover was cracked when I received it. Didn't bother to send it back, 'cause I live in Norway. However, I think CDs should be wrapped more tightly than in a bubble-wrap envelope."
4,Nice product but expensive,This small(same as cell phone) informeter gives you much more information than your cars dash. it is very easy to fit and operate. The only down side it the price.
4,A Well Done Thriller,"Jack Allen's Change of Heart is a very well done spy thriller, complete with a likeable hero and a very plausible, yet still very exciting storyline. Josh McGowan has been assigned to bring a young female former Soviet operative to the US after she escaped from a Russian prison. Of course, nothing is ever easy, and Josh meets with many compelling roadblocks along the way. The story is told in an engaging fashion--readable, detailed, exciting. Josh, and the story, were not overwhelmingly ""macho"". The plot is full of many interesting twists, which are all grounded in reality. Enjoy."
4,Action from the opening line,"Josh McGowan: international (and yet patently American) man of intrigue.Your mission, should you choose to accept it: Brave the action, adventure, and breathtaking stunts McGowan executes as he works to rescue a young Russian, a woman of mysteriously high importance to intelligence and military figures of the former Soviet Union. But why is she so important to them? What secrets does she hold? McGowan would like to know, but she's not talking.What we're talking about here is an adventure, a spy/military/political thriller, and first and foremost, an action novel penned with a gift for the mode by author Jack Allen - so much so that this novel might easily translate into one of the action flicks Hollywood is so fond of turning out.If you are a fan of spy novels or action flicks, take Allen's ""A Change of Heart"" out for a spin. But be careful; on Allen's roadways, the rules tend to disappear."
2,Pretty Far-fetched...,"Altho I found this book somewhat entertaining I found it pretty far-fetched in that SO many unlikely things happened and that Joshua McGowen was shot, cut, knifed, beat up, blown up, crashed airplanes, boats and cars and whatever else and he still prevailed over the ""Bad Guys"".And all this happened in less that a week?And, of course this is just my 1 worth."
1,Poor quality,"I purchased this item, because I have a glass stove top that is a hassle to clean. It immediately became apparent that it was of inferior quality in construction, but I decided to simply cope with it...Unfortunately after only a few uses the non-stick coating began to peel off and I threw it in the trash.....After a year and a half, I decided to look for something similiar, but better quality and saw that it was still being sold by Amazon....I would not buy this item, if I were you."
2,MINI FRY PAN,UNIT IS NICELY MADE BUT NEEDS A MUCH MORE ACCURATE THERMOMETER AND WAY OF HEATING THE PAN EVENLY RATHER THAN THE CURRENT PERIMETER HEATING RING
1,Maximatic,"Returned this item, as it was of poor quality! Smoke came from the bottom of pan and the element was open under the bottom of pan. Seemed to be a fire risk. Very unsatisfactory, but the return process was easy and more than satisfactory. Thank you!"
1,Bad deal.,This little pan looked so good but ended up in the trash. The vendor offered to pay the shipping costs to return it but alas the vendor never followed through. I sent several emails and even telephoned and no results. The pan was not non stick and heated unevenly. A very bad deal.
3,Compact cooking,Skillet just right size for 1or2. Would like a longer cord. The thermostat won't maintain a contstant temp. You set it and when it reaches desired temp. it cuts off. It just works like an on off switch.
2,Maxi-Matic EFS-400 Elite Cuisine 7 inch non stick electric skillet,I really wish I had not purchased this little pan. The cord attaches in a complex manner...has a little plastic lever attached to a little metal curved rod that locks it in place once it is plugged in...and comes loose with a sneeze. I bought it for my year in campus housing while I complete my degree. I have only been here on campus for a week; have attempted to cook in the little skillet three times...and only once was successful. I made some gravy to go with some meat I had cooked (the meat being the one successful time)...and the skillet lost power due to the above mentioned problem so many times I couldn't get the gravy to boil or thicken. It looks cute. It looks functional. IT ISN'T FUNCTIONAL! I do not recommend this little pan.!
1,nothing but junk!,"When this came, there was no return adress on it, and no sales reciept. It only took me two minutes to find out why. The temperature control had a paper on it to show where the temperature was set, but no numbers. The paper would not stick to the control. The lid had no handle on the top to take it off. I was stuck with this pice of junk because I could not get an answer from amazon, and still havent; and it't been way over a month. I finally went ahead and used it cause it looked like I was stuck with it.First time using it, the teflon started coming off. I couldn't even use the spatula you use for teflon pans cause it brought the teflon off. I threw it away.Never seen such a piece of junk. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY,IT'S TOO HARD TO COME BY."
2,should have listened to the other reviews,"Had to return the skillet. Nice idea of a small skillet, but it did not heat evenly. Low did not work, high burnt everything. Got my money back so at least that worked out well."
2,Too Small,"Small, also did as instructed before using it, and the food still stuck to the pan. No thermostat. Not a product for anyone that likes to cook."
1,Maxi-Matic EFS-400 Electric Skillet,"Was excited upon ordering this small skillet, but the handle will not stay locked on so very dangerous and therefore one cannot use. very disappointing. Very poor type of electrical cord and the way it has to be attached because you can't lock it in place."
3,Mini-skillet review,"We returned the first one for obvious pitting in cooking area, which was noted in a previous review-but we wanted to try a second one before giving up. The second skillet had very minor pitting, but was acceptable. Inspire of proper seasoning , the food being cooked still tends to stick."
5,Great small frypan,This is the most convenient small electric fry pan. It's just right for a single person. It allows you to cook two pieces of chicken. I love the size.
4,works well but...,"This skillet works wonderfully, it is very easy to get the exact temp you want with it- the only problem I have had is that the coating has bubbled up and flaked off. I use it daily at about 130 degrees so the flaking problem is not that I'm using it too hot. I love it otherwise though, besides the coating, it is perfect for what I use it for!"
2,T.,"Love the size. Cooked scrambled eggs and a lot of the coating came off when I washed the pan. Even more of the coating came off the second time I used it. I am afraid to use it any longer because of the coating. Waste of money, should have returned it after first use."
1,Is it defective or are they all like this?,"I can't tell if I received a defective specimen or whether they're all like this. It looks like several recent reviews have been quite negative, whereas the older reviews are more positive. Perhaps the recent model is different from older versions.It looks well built and the lid is especially nice (heavy). However, I have the following problem each time I've tried to cook something with it:It heats up quickly, but once the dialed in temperature is reached it shuts off power. Sometimes jiggling the handle helps but usually not. I bought this from a supermarket and threw all the packaging away so I may be out of luck.I definitely cannot recommend this."
2,ok skillet,"worked ok for awhile, but nonstick coating is falling off and the bottom is rusting. spend more for something better"
1,don't buy this,"The Maxi-matic was purchased to cook breakfast and reheat leftovers, but it does neither satisfactorily. The pan is either on (high) briefly or it turns itself off, too hot for an egg and doesn't stay on long enough for safe reheats. Part of the problem may be a faulty temperature control,but the thinness of the pan itself is probably to blame for the super fast cooking; too bad, because the cost of returning the item from Hawaii means it will just sit on the shelf until I can replace it with another small skillet.....that works."
1,cheaply made food sticks excessively,this product is cheaply made and no matter what I cook IT STICKS!!!! wasted money
2,I don't recommend this skillet.,"I like the size of this skillet but it's not staying ""on"". I would send it back but unfortunately I have thrown the box out. I received it at Christmas and I am very disappointed that it's not working properly. Something to do with the handle and it's connection to the side of the skillet."
2,Did not work for me.,I bought this looking at all those good reviews. But did not work for me. It got jammed and did not spray fertilizer as it should be. I ended up with using trusted manual one. I returned it back.
3,Death Rage,Death Rage is the Last film that Yul Brynner made. In fact Yul is the only good thing about this movie. There is action in the movie but the Italian Mafia gunmen are easily taken out by Yul until the end of the film. Marin Balsam is unbelievable as the Italian police captain.
2,Terrible value,"This is pretty much what they cost at any grocery store, if not slightly more. Not a good value, very disappointing from Amazon. Also, they arrived in a bag with quite a bit of damage, with the batteries spilled out all over the place!"
2,Missing Most of the Good Hits,"I don't see a lot of his hits in this set - Annie's Song, Fly Away, Thank God I'm a Country Boy, Calypso, and Grandma's Feather Bed - these just off the top of my head. Definitely not a definitive collection. Too many good songs missing considering this is a 3-CD set.*11 Mar 2012 - Modified to correct spelling in title - no new information entered."
3,Tricky but interesting,Crary presents some interesting views on the perception of art. I found that it took a while for his ideas to formulate - the writing tends to be a bit wordy. I would recommend the book with reservations - really only for the serious academic reader. Not a casual bedside book.
4,Techniques of the Observer: On Vision and Modernity in the 19th Century,"lt tall me how to see,who to READ the wold.I get many important concept."
2,Minor minimal,"2 1/2Aside from a few powerfully implemented moments, this project just doesn't stick for me. Working from typically beautiful elements, here there is a little too pretentious application of vocals, coupled with melody and time changes that feel comparatively less immersible, if building to the logically satisfying conclusion."
2,"Fun, but cheap","I bought about a dozen of these to use as party favors for my daughter's birthday. Several arrived non-functional. I was able to open it and fix the loose connections and get them working, but these are far from durable. Yes, its cool that they light up and make noise, but there are more substantial Harry Potter wands that more closely resemble what's used in the movies that I would recommend."
2,Not sure,My son loves this wand as he is a Harry Potter fan but as others have said I do not like that there is no on/off switch. I think ours is defective as we have gone threw 3 sets of batteries in two days so I will exchange it and see if we get a better battery life otherwise this wand is no good at all. My son will be very disappointed.
3,Harry Potter Delux Wand with Light and Sound,This product came in a timely manner. My son had lots of fun with it at Halloween but it broke pretty easily. All in all it was worth it.
2,Not that Great,"Agree with other reviews, batteries are very hard to install so that the wand works correctly. It either goes off very easily or not at all - not on/off switch means you have to take the batteries out to put it up and each time seems to degrade the abilty to function. worked for halloween costume, but probably not going to get too much play time after that."
4,Very helpful.,"With this book in addition to Chapelle's and Stewart's books, I am beginning to grasp round bottom traditional wood construction."
2,Boat building,Buy only if you are really intent on building a sailboat the old fashioned way. Virtually wortless for wood power boats.
1,Wrong set,"I read all of the reviews and I thought that this company would be reliable. But instead of giving me all of the episodes, they gave me two of the first boxes. I did not recieve episodes 109-167. I am very disapointed in this company."
1,This screams bootleg...,"I love Inuyasha, and it would be great if this were legit, but I'm sorry to say that a boxset with all the episodes and movies that's ""All regions"" and lists no company is pretty much 99.9% positive for bootleg... Just an update, ""Chinese"" subtitles should be another dead giveaway, this is a bootleg folks..."
1,This Is A Bootleg!!!,"Review for Inuyasha TV Series Collection(1-167 + Movies)I love the Inuyasha series,but the fact that so many people make bootlegs of it pisses me off. I gave this one star because it is clearly and obviously a bootleg. If I were rating the series itself, I would have given it 4 stars. First off, I am a huge Inuyasha fan and I know for a fact that the entire series hasn't been officially released in a pack ever. Second, the cover, if you look closely, is the same box cover for the official Season 2 box set. It even still says Season 2 on it. Please support the series and buy the real official DVDs and not this theif's excuse of a box set."
2,DISAPPOINTED,"Picture used is not what I received, plain and simple, it's a different version than what I got even though all episodes are there. It's that simple."
1,Illegal Imports .... aka Bootlegs!!!!,"Don't buy this illegal, bootleg crap ...Support Viz by buying the official R1 product!!!Don't support the scum who are nothing more than a bunch of thieves so you can save a few dollars .... your only hurting the folks who actually produce these great anime series.Amazon ... why do you allow people to sell this copied crap???"
4,"""THE COMING ISLAMIC INVASION OF ISRAEL (END TIME ANSWERS)""","Mark Hitchcock always is well prepared when he writes a book and this is no exception. It was well written, concise and easy read! Well done...Hal"
5,Excellent Book Without All the Complicated Details!,This book was excellent! Mark Hitchcock did a fine job of explaining what is to come in the near future but in a way that was concise and not complicated. I highly recommend it to those who don't want to be bogged down with all the details but yet have an understanding of Ezekiel 38 & 39.
3,"Some Art, Alot of Boring Scenes","This film is not one of the better humanist war films because it doesn't entail much except lurid shots of the protagonist in his former self before the war. Ivan, who is a rabid, little self-defeating skunk who gets angry at people, has no endeavor to show us his true self. Tarkovsky does some fine work in certain scenes but there is just too much mundane glamor like the soldiers talking about nothing. There is not enough sense of anxiety, artistic form or even conflict to stimulate an interest and the contrived, typical European art house ending was wholly un-original."
2,No Band included,"Buyer beware. I had rented this dvd previously, so I knew basically what I was getting--except I thought I was getting the exercise band. The strength workouts are good. The short lower body workout is a killer--that is, if your DVD comes with the band. I don't know why some people received the band included in their DVD boxes and some didn't. I was one of the unlucky ones who didn't get one. I don't know how you are supposed to do these exercies without one. I feel like I've been gyped. I happen to have a band from another DVD, otherwise this dvd is useless. Tamilee has never been a good at cueing her aerobics. This one is no exception. The first cardio is a little easier to follow--the second is probably impossible to follow without several practices."
2,NOT tamilees best work,"This video was very slow paced, great if you are just starting to workout. If you are at an intermediate level buy Tami's ""I want that body"" vidoes. They are much, much better and to a faster more upbeat pace. I have to say this video is one that didn't take a whole lot of time or thought, I think she just put it together for some extra dough! NOT one of her best works."
5,Workout in Hawaii,"This workout is perfect for the workout-phobic. I can do this workout! And do enjoy it pretty much every time I do. Every time she says ""come on, you can do it - I believe in you"" I honestly believe her (unlike Denise Austin and a lot of others).If your workouts are sporatic and you are looking for motivations instead of painful workouts that feel like major work (i.e. make you feel like you're going to keel over and pass out), I highly recommed this workout.With that said, the other reviews are correct - the workout is not as hard core as other videos like The Firm. But!This is one of the first videos of hers that made me really like her. Since then, I've been able to tackle her other videos like her I Want That Body series (which I found too challenging when I first started working out).The only part I don't like about the video? She says the video is for the over 40's. I am definitely not over 40 (was in my 20's when I first bought this DVD)."
3,its ok,its a pretty good video. very disappointed though - it says it comes with the exercise band you need but it doesn't now i have to go find one.
4,Same material as Championship No Limit & Pot Limit Hold 'Em,"I really enjoyed Championship No Limit & Pot Limit Hold 'Em and was looking forward to reading this book. The book is about 1/2 limit hold'em hands and 1/2 no-limit hold'em hands. The no-limit hold'em hands are the same as the material presented in Championship No Limit & Pot Limit Hold 'Em. So if you are looking for different material on no-limit, this book is not it. It also contains actual hands played from many different WSOP championships, which are interesting. It's a good book, just not much different from Championship No Limit & Pot Limit Hold 'Em."
4,easy grammar in daily bits,"The Daily Grams are a series of books that make it possible to insert a ten minute grammar lesson into each day. The lessons may include correctly punctuating a sentence, correcting capitalization, identifying the parts of speech in a sentence or combining two simple sentences into a complex one. Each book contains 180 lessons- one for each day of the school year. A fun and simple way to keep grammar skills practiced and reviewed or to reinforce skills recently acquired."
2,Dissappointed,"Bobby Collins used to be the #1 comic in America to me a few years ago. However, with the last 2 DVD's and last 2 cd's, all with duplicate material, it is a shame that I can no longer say that. he is still one of my favorites but this DVD has the same old material he was doing years ago. I'd love to see a new and improved up to date Bobby."
4,Collins is on fire!!,I have always likes his standup. It's not heavy on the vulgarity and really gets his audience laughing. Wish I could see him in person.
1,DVD doesnt work,"I received the DVD quickly after purchasing. I didn't watch the DVD immediately, but when I tried to watch it a few days ago, the DVD will not play."
2,Hand Held Broadcast Spreader,"I received this order, but not before I ordered another like item froma different source!!!!"
1,Buyer Beware ... product quality and warranty policy,"I ordered this product when our printer indicated that fuser needed to be changed soon. Our computer tech changed the fuser within 2 to 3 weeks of receiving it. After 4-5 months use, the printer began jamming. The problem continued to worsen until we're unable to use the printer because every print job jams. Two different techs said the fuser was the problem and must be replaced, cogs not turning, yada-yada ....Contacted Seller to make right. Response:""We warranty our products for six months from the date of sale with core exchange and three months without."""
5,The Perfect Baby Shower Gift,"As a first-time grandparent I was thrilled to discover FIRST STEPS, a delightful ""giggle wiggle waggle"" of a story. Together my grandson and I chuckle over the lively and engaging text -- perfectly blended with child-friendly art. FIRST STEPS is the perfect gift for a baby shower or a new grandparent."
3,"with digital recording, can't errant brass be removed?","Re tempo of the Shostakovich concerto's 1st movement (Allegretto), I prefer Ma's to Rostropovich's (especially in the second half where Rostopovich's feels heavy/plodding by comparison). My ideal would be the Yo Yo Ma 1st & 3rd movements with the Rostropovich 2nd & 4th.But quite apart from the question of tempo, Yo Yo Ma's recording is marred by an unmistakable (loud!) mis-entry by the horn 7.5 minutes into the 2nd movement (Moderato).CBS has issued Yo Yo Ma's Shostakovich concerto twice -- this one paired with the Kabalevsky concerto, the other paired with the Shostakovich 5th Symphony -- but it is the same performance (Philadelphia, 1982) in both recordings, and the same engineering. With digital recording technology, couldn't CBS have removed the performance error?"
5,XT10 Intelliscope a great scope!,"This scope is well made and well designed. One of the few dobsonian scopes with computer control. If you are looking for a nice scope that won't break the bank and let you see planets and DSO's, this is the way to go. Easy to assemble, easy to setup, and fun to use. Perfect height for kids. What more can you ask for for only $650.00. Even the two eyepieces included are decent. The only options you will want are the hand controller, now only $99.00, and the $89.00 carry bag. Other than that, have fun!"
3,very small for an extension,I like the quality of the gate but I ended up needing to buy two extensions to fit my entry way because it only extends the gate 9 inches.
3,well written but poorly lay out. No index or cross reference,"The author does a very good jop at trail discriptions and gives a good feel for the lay of the land. How ever the guide would benifit greatly with better maps, specifically a much more detailed overview map which shows the major peaks and their relationship to the trials dicussed. An index with the trials and peaks that is cross referenced would make it much easier to plan trips. The author should take a look at the AMC White Mt guide book, the bench mark for all guide books. This book did not met my expectations and I am looking into others."
2,"Detailed trail descriptions, but poor maps, no index","This is a frustrating book to use although the meat of it---the trail descriptions and stats---is very detailed and well written. The lack of an index, or any way to use all the maps together, and the fact that the maps are very incomplete, make it very annoying to use. Add to this that there is an almost explicit LACK of information or routes for any of the peaks, and one wonders why one bought the book at all. There is no route to the top of Square Top Peak, nor over Dinwoody Pass, or up to Gannett. Even the non-technical peaks are omitted. There is also no ""About the Author"" section (although it says that there is one), and this is important when one is going to rely on him to guide you into the Wind River Range."
2,A pain to use,"This guide book is a pain to use. Mainly because of the poor maps. The hiking guide is organized by trailheads, but the overview maps that are given do not cover a large enough area to plan a 4 or 5 day trip, which is the main reason I bought this book. I find myself flipping from section to section trying to piece together the trails in my mind. I've bought many other Falcon guides, and have been happy with all the rest. Since I know of no Wind River alternative guidebook, I bet you'll probably still buy this; I would, it does have some good info. But, I recomend buying a Wind River map while your at it, or use some sort of computerized map (google earth)."
3,Helpful,"The trail descriptions are great and very informative. The distances are highly innacurate. I checked several of them with mapping software and they invariably are 10-15% on the low side. I like the descriptions and the profiles, but I use mapping software for the distances."
5,A patriots must have!!!,This is the best book on our country and its boiled down to an hours reading- exceptional quality and information.
2,Nice Pictures - Litte Substance,"The amount of information on the use of a biscuit joiner is minimal at best. The book has excellent photographs of several well designed projects that can be made with a biscuit joiner, if you choose to do so. Also, all dimensions listed in the book are metric. The book is more about design than it is about how to use a biscuit joiner."
3,Falls short of information,"Although well done, I expected a greater amount of information on the use of a biscuit joiner. Only one chapter was dedicated to use and the remainder to projects which are primarily good or bad, depending on your tastes."
4,exactly what you'd expect,"The only way to be disappointed with this would be to order it, not knowing what tenors are. Everyone else will be delighted."
2,Beware,I bought this thinking it was exactly what I was looking for. But you can't tell from the photo that there are these really stupid looking bumps in the shape of the PSP's buttons on the front of the case. Trust me: it looks awful. I'm not sure why they did it; it probably cost them more to stamp those bumps into the case. I'm returning mine and buying a case that doesnt look ridiculous.
1,Hoodia - Is There Really Any Hoodia In This?,"I used this for a month. I took the full daily recommended amount, and then increased the amount by two. So I was taking three times the recommended daily amount. Nothing happened. No appetite suppressant effects were felt. I wonder if this has any Hoodia in it?"
2,Doesn't Work,I have been using this product now for almost a month and I have yet to see any type of difference in hunger or helping to control my cravings. It might work for some but it hasn't done anything for me. Dexatrim works better and it cost's lest.
1,Hoodia Gordoni plus???,"After reading all the wow reviews on the internet, I decided to go with this product. Well, it did NOTHING for me. It did not suppress my appetite at all. I stopped after 3 weeks of regular use, when I noticed no changes. I had to stop as I could not justify popping pills that did not work."
5,Glorious Echoes,"I purchased this dvd for an alumnus of Notre Dame whose relative was part of the original dream team. She thoroughly enjoyed it, especially seeing the buildings of the campus as they were. Quite a comprehensive history of the fighting Irish football teams. It contains priceless old video footage from the early days of college football. I wish I could be more specific, but I've only seen the dvd once after gifting it."
1,Randomly switches tracks,For whatever reason while music is playing it always tries to switch tracks. Threw it away. Don't buy. I owned one from a different maker that did work.
3,Completely Depends on you Cassette Player,"I drive a '97 Ford Taurus and this device works great in my cassette player. It was a plug and play kind of deal, very easy to use. The sound quality is decent. There is a light lo fi mist sound in between tracks. Overall, it's a treat for me to listen to my I-pod in my old hoopty. It may not work for your ride though.CAUTION: Before you purchase call Griffin at (615) 399-7000 to check compatibility. It didn't work in my wife's 2002 Toyota Corolla."
2,Cheaply made,"Despite my almost fanatical attention to pulling on the plug and not the wire over the six months I've owned this thing, the sheathing on the wire came loose anyway and exposed the wires inside. Also, what may be related is that SmartDeck seems to have lost its mind: it now seems to send the iPod all kinds of strange signals; songs skip and repeat at random."
1,"lousy item, lousy seller","wasn't clearly advertised as not appropirate for nano, not even worth the postage to return"
3,Works for what I need...,"OK - I hit the ""Buy"" button before I read the tons of bad reviews on this product. So, I approached the use of Smartdeck with some trepidation. Guess what? It performs just as well as my 3 year old Sony cassette adapter. The sound quality is good on my factory Monsoon deck in my 2003 VW Passat. There was a large amount of clicking and noise when I first inserted the adapter, but switching to side B eliminated it. No hissing or muffled sound.What makes me happy with this product is that it automatically pauses my iPod when I switch off my stereo. It was a pain to have to remember to manually hit that pause button each time I got out of my car. I am also impressed that it automatically adjusts the iPod volume to optimum settings. The track skipping feature does not seem to work as advertised. I've managed to make it work on odd occasion but overall it seems non-functioning. Oh, well - 2 out of 3 ain't bad!"
5,Do you love poor sound quality?,"If you're like me, there's nothing you hate more than great sound quality. Frankly, nothing bothers me more than listening to music on my iPod via my really high quality car stereo without it sounding like I've got a burlap bag over my head, just like the one from Missing in Action -- in fact, the only shortcoming of this awesome device is that it doesn't come with a hungry rat that'll gnaw your face off!"
1,Did not perform as advertised,I'll make this short...1) Noisy2) Doesn't skip songs as advertised3) Major disappointment4) Returned
1,Didn't work in my 2004 Infiniti FX35,"I pre-ordered this over 9 months ago. Amazingly enough, it arrived yesterday. I was really hoping to have the shuffle controls on my steering wheel. What a huge dissapointment. Aside from the fact that the controls didn't have ANY affect on the IPOD mini 4GB (as in Zero control), the normal operation noise coming from the cassette adapter was louder than any regular cassette I have ever played. The device practically screamed compared to the rest of the noise level in the car.I will return the SmartDeck, sadly, as it offered great promise but didn't turn out to be so Smart. My next car will have the IPOD integration from the factory, so until then, I'm back to my regular cassette adapter that came with my old XM Car Adapter kit. This unit I think sells for about $10-15 and works well."
1,it truly is a piece of garbage,"i didn't read these reviews before buying this ""product"". i wish i did. i also have a 2004 Acura TL and tried this thing in the cassette deck. it made that infamous whirring/clicking sound. i gave up after 5 minutes. wrapped it back into it's packaging. i'm returning it tomorrow. don't buy it, don't buy it, don't buy it."
1,Didn't work for me,"I have been waiting quite a while for this little gadget. Sadly, after all this time waiting, I was disappointed.I have a 2004 Highlander and an Ipod mini (4gig), this unit did not work in my car at all. It just spins arond in the cassette deck for about 10 seconds, trys to fast-forward, then ejects itself. Very dissapointing.I find it somewhat misleading that the company clearly states that the device does not work in some vehicles, yet does not publish a known list of cars it works/doesn't work with. Basically leaving it up to the consumer to try it out themselves.I will think twice about buying any products from this company in the future."
1,Don't buy it!,"I purchased this cassette adapter to replace the iPod FM transmitter I had been using, because the FM signal was weak and would sometimes fade out. The SmartDeck is far worse. The sound resulting from this adapter is very distorted, from what appears to be severe overmodulation. I contacted support off the Griffin Technology web site (from where I purchased the product) multiple times but they will not respond. Don't waste your money. I have already tossed mine in the dumpster out back."
2,Does not work as advertised.,"I bought this ages ago and it has finally stopped working completely. It's okay; I got about nine months of use out of it.The use, however, was disappointing. It doesn't do the fast forward/skipping business AT ALL. Okay, about one in ten times, which is enough to dissuade me from even bothering.The ONLY useful thing about this adapter is the automagic pause feature. If I turned off the stereo in my car, it would pause the iPod. Which is useful if you want to just put it on hold and stick in your bag.If you're willing to pay for that feature, then do it. But if you think you're getting something that will skip tracks, think again."
1,BULL CRAP....DOESN'T WORK... grrrrrrrr............,"I own a brand new Nissan Maxima 2006 and it comes with a BOSE stereo system. I had a fm trasmitter before and it always has this static sound which is quiet annoying.I went to Staples today to do some window shopping and saw this griffin thingy and thought it would be cool!!I was SO excited and came back home immediately to check this thing out. I ran to my car and used this...and guess what, VOILA.. this piece of crap kept auto-reversing three or four times and my car spat it out :-(too bad.... UTTER WASTE.... DOES NOT WORK... DON'T WASTE UR MONEY..I'll be returning this the first thing tomorrow....boooo.. I don't know if they'll take it back cuz I didn't get the receipt!!Anyways, stand clear from this piece of crap... useless piece (...)CURRENT MOOD = MAD... VERYY VERYYYYYYY MAD!!!"
1,If only it worked!,"I'm sorry to say I'm really underwhelmed with the SmartDeck. I pre-ordered mine at Griffin as soon as I heard about it at Macworld in early 2005 and received it last week, nearly a year later.The Skip and Scan features simply do not work. My car's tape player sometimes spits it out when it's inserted. The sound response is ok on the bass, but the mid and high levels leave a lot to be desired. (The Sony tape adapter that came with my Discman when I got it, oh, 7 years ago, sounds much better.)About the only feature that works as advertised is that it turns my iPod on/off when the tape player is turned on/off. I also noticed that If I fast forward my tape (not skip it) and then hit play after about 5 seconds, it *sometimes* skips to the next song.I'll be returning mine."
1,What a piece of junk!,"I was very excited when UPS dropped off my SmartDeck today, but had to wait until after work to try it out. I decided to hop on here to read some reviews while I waited for the clock to hit five. Everyone was complaining about their highly anticipated SmartDeck not working in their cars. I knew that I would have better luck than everyone else. Mine was going to work. I raced to my car, plugged in my iPod, popped the SmartDeck in the tape player of my '05 VW GTI. IT DIDN'T FREAKIN' WORK!!! It did everything that everyone else was complaining about.1. It was noisy2. It randomly scanned/skipped songs3. Was completely unresponsive to any activity from the tape deck.4. Caused my tape deck to report ""Error"" on the screen and eject the SmartDeck.In conclusion, this tape adapter was a complete waste of money. Griffin is trying to pull a fast one on a very anxious iPod community. Please save your money, and save yourself the trouble of having to return this product."
1,Listen to other user's reviews!!,"I pre-ordered the Griffin SmartDeck two months ago and it really seemed like a good and inexpensive alternative to having my Infiniti factory radio modified. About a week ago I read other user's reviews and sadly dismissed their opinion thinking how bad could this product be? Oh My God, what a hunk of junk!!! the advertised controls do not work at all and if you like hearing your tape deck run more than listen to your music, you bought the right adapter. It's not fair that you can't give a product minus stars. Don't waste your time!! Don't do it!! Don't Buy it!! Retailers will be giving them away or paying you to take them in another month.Later that year...Is Amazon still selling this piece of...!!! Amazon, end the pain, please!!! The highway patrol should force these on the people they give ticket to. No wait, they should give these out instead of tickets and make them use it for a week. Nobody would drive or 55mph again."
1,Horrible!!!,"The main reason I wanted an ipod was for listening to it in the car. I just used it tonight and it is going straight back to the store. The background noise was horrible, it only played out of the front speakers and I had to turn the volume almost all the way up to listen to it at the volume level I normally use THEN it kept skipping tracks when I wouldn't even touch it. It would play sometimes only seconds of a song or about a minute of a song and then skip to the next. Not once did it let a song play through. What a piece of CRAP"
1,Worst...Adapter...Ever,"Griffin is not lying when they say that this adapter will not work in some cassette decks. They could have been a little more honest and said ""most"". I can't fault them too much for this though; they at least mention this problem.My biggest gripe with the product is that, even when it will work, it makes an incredible amount of mechanical noise in the deck. This would be more annoying, if you could hear it over the god awful hum coming from your speakers. Honestly, I never even checked whether the song skipping/seeking worked properly; I couldn't get past the abysmal sound quality. Play/pause did seem to work as advertised, but that's not worth paying double (or more) the cost of adapters with higher sound quality.This is a fantastic idea that's been horribly implemented. I would probably try a similar product from a company that performs quality control ."
2,Barely works,"Infiniti G35 with Bose audio - the only smart feature is that it usually pauses my iPod when I turn the stereo off and also resumes when I turn it on (both with power button and ignition). Track skipping never worked.The spinner rattling sound is very loud, however, and removing the spin wheels would probably break the play/pause feature. I think I'll return this and spring for the wiring into my stereo's SAT function."
2,Does not work in 2005 Toyota Prius or 2004 Honda Pilot; *does* work in home stereo,"I have 2005 Prius with the upgraded stereo; in my setup, my iPod skips to the nexts song every few seconds even if I don't press any buttons. In my dad's Honda Pilot, no sound is ever heard; they tape is automatically ejected after a few seconds. But I tried the setup in a home rack system, and it worked as advertised. Conclusion: it's extremely picky about the tape deck its used in. Griffin tech support acknowledged that there was nothing they could do to help me and suggested I return it, which I did."
1,Kindle version nearly unreadable,"Just about the time you get to relaxing and get into the story, another incomprehensible typo jangles the storyline. I've applied for a refund. The sad thing is that I'm an avid Dan Simmons fan.Here are some sample sentences from the first 7% of the book*T11 get an orderly and a gurney.But he had to admit that tins old man was a finalist in that contest.Later, he told himself that he should have known that die universe was gettingready to readjust its balance of pain at his expense.It had a Confederate flag hung on die side of it and a clapped-out '72 Camaroparked outside.""How about die cheerleader?"""
4,Now We Know Who Kurtz's Daddy Is....,"This is the third in Simmons' hard-boiled series of Joe Kurtz books, and it's another winner. It's a little more predictable than the first two (not surprising with later series entries), but still a good read-- and we now know who Kurtz's father is (or we do if we are fans of Richard Stark).I'm used to noir heroes getting beat up and abused: Philip Marlowe and the Continental Op and Travis McGee and every two-bit gumshoe gets pummelled into unconsciousness or winged by a gat or tortured unmercifully on every other case. But Simmons is REALLY cruel to Kurtz. In every book, he's so abused you just wanna tell him to sit down and have a beer and watch Oprah and recover a little. Hell, I thought he was pretty much dead at the end of the second book. Now, here he is, back again. Ten pages in, though, he's pretty much dead again. Simmons: Give Kurtz a break!Simmons is always worth reading-- if you've read the first two Kurtzes, you'll want to read this one."
3,"Useful, but...","The stand connect securely to the window and holds an iPhone well. However, the small feet at the bottom of the holster are on a track that has no stops, so they easily fall out. Haven't lost them yet, but fear that I will."
5,A smart person's guide to choosing childcare,"If you're the kind of person who likes to research things thoroughly, this is the book for you. It's far more comprehensive than any other childcare book on the market, covering important issues that most other books ignore, like how to prevent problems in your relationship with your childcare provider (whether a nanny or a member of the daycare center staff) and how to troubleshoot any difficulties that happen to arise. There are also tons of great checklists and valuable resources (e.g. a list of caregiver-child ratios for various ages and for each state; lists of the most useful childcare web sites; the inside scoop on what to pay your childcare provider; and more). I think this book should be required reading for every working parent in America!"
2,A big disappointment,"Why is it so difficult to find a book that is succinct and gets to the point quickly? I could not believe how much useless information was in this book, burying the information I was really looking for.I am an intelligent working mother. I want answers quickly. I don't have time to wade through so much stuff that is irrelevant to me. Who has time to read all this stuff? It seemed like the author kept adding more ""stuff"" so the book would be longer. Some chapters... like returning to work while breastfeeding... were completely irrelevant to the topic of locating childcare.What I did like about this book was that it made me feel ""normal"" about the feelings I am having. However, there was way too much of that kind of stuff in a book that I hoped would be a more hands-on guide that would help me understand all my childcare options and guide me through the minefield of locating somebody I could trust.I'm still waiting for the ""official"" guide to childcare!"
1,Not worth the time,"This book is a 20 year old, scholarly look at a subject which has changed dramatically in that time frame. I was expecting more personal insights, which might have kept the book current on an emotional level."
1,broke and uncomfortable to wear,I bought this thinking it would be great. Unfortunately the clasps has sharp spikey bits on it that dig into your skin and hurt. It also broke.Don't buy it
1,arrived broken,"Nice. The CHE arrived broken. When I plugged it in, it remained cold. I shook it and heard a broken part rattling inside. I guess ordering light bulbs is a bad idea. Next CHE I get will be in a store so I can return it if it doesn't work."
1,Buy a light fixture that is double the wattage,"Number one you need to buy a light fixture that is at least twice the recommended wattage of the heat emitter. I have a 150w hooked up to a huge 300w fixture, now after this one fused it's self to the light fixture and then blew up."
1,Heat and dry my whole house up,I place it in my house and it is so powerful that it just heat my whole house up and I got so dry that I cannot use it anymore. I return the item after using it for a day. I think you don't want to see your pets' skin crack because of extreme dryness.
5,GREAT heat source!,"The Zoo Med 150watt ceramic heat emitter--EMITTS HEAT! It is GREAT! If you are looking for a strong heat source, this is it! I enclosed my outdoor pond during the winter months, and this provides excellent heat for my pond critters."
1,Garbage,"These must be seconds because they separate off of the metal socket threads, and the socket threads are smashed down so you can't even get them screwed in easily. These are junk, broken and I'm returning all of them. What a waste of time."
5,heater review,I use this heater for my birds in the aviary. It is very safe and the heat is very even.
2,Get it close,"I wanted to use this on a red tail boa that I had in a 40 gallon breeder tank. I had it on for several minutes (probably about 30) and it would not heat the basking area of the tank sufficiently which is about 16 inches away from the lamp. I replaced it with what I had before and am currently using, a red heat lamp bulb. I gave this 2 stars instead of only one because it DID get hot, and I mean scorching hot, but it didn't radiate heat much past about 6 inches."
4,Great Dog House Warmer,"I installed a greenhouse thermometer and a drop ceiling light fixture for keeping our dogs warm in the winter and this bulb works better than anything else I have tried. Lasted the whole winter and doesn't emit any light, which I imagine the dogs appreciate."
4,Tiny chipped spot but otherwise good stuff.,Seems to work exactly as advertised. Arrived with a very small chipped spot but doesn't look like it will affect performance. I'm happy with the purchase.
1,it stopped working within 2 months,This stopped producing heat within two months. The info says it should last up to 5 years! I can't believe it broke so soon.
4,Chicken coop heater,"This item was purchased to replace a 150W infrared bulb in a chicken coop. It seems to put out the same amount of heat (150W), and has the added bonus of not producing any visible light.So why did I give it only 4 stars? I just can't bring myself to writing that I love a ceramic heater."
1,Fire Hazard!,"Zoo Med ReptiCare Ceramic Infrared Heat Emitter 150 Watts.I liked this bulb when I received it and thought it was of good quality.It worked for about two weeks and quit one cold night.When I removed the bulb from the lamp socket I noticed that the metal base was loose and there had been electrical arcing that burned through the meal screw thread base on the bulb in a couple of places.It seems to me that this represents a fire hazard.My guess is that the manufacturer is having these made by the low bidder in China and they are using inferior materials.I looks like the metal base is glued on with some sort of ceramic adhesive that did not work properly, this let the base come loose and the neutral wire from the bulb element is just stuck under the metal base, not soldered or welded.All in all a nice looking heat bulb that has been ""value engineered"" to the point where it is not a good product and seems likely to be a fire hazard."
2,Great product--with a flaw,"I just bought my fourth Zoo Med heater, which does a great job of taking the edge off the cold for my small chicken coop. The problem is -- they all fail the same way -- the bond between the ceramic and the metal screw base lets go. I haven't gotten around to exploring a way to mount it differently, maybe place it in a metal basket so the weight of the ceramic doesn't bear on the base seal. Anyway, it's too bad such a great product isn't more reliable."
1,Deceptive advertising,"The batteries were loose, not in the package as shown. Moreover, they were weak and corroded the connections to my rather expensive remote for my hearing aids."
3,You get what you get.,"Well these are batteries, they were new like they said, so i guess it was a good product."
3,Zen? Nothing to it.,"I lived in Europe for a number of years and one of my closest friends was a 'zen'monk. He would say..'Wolff, so many books in the west on Zen..Enlightenment..having made the leap.... They never speak about those that did not make it to the other side..went crazy. This book is no better or worse than the myriad of writings on this subject. To have a better understanding on the writing on the writings(almost all writing for the west is translation, and that is a big problem in itself.), I might recommend BUDDHIST HERMENEUTICS(Retrieval of meaning, especially from a text)Donald S. Lopez, Jr."
5,Sing along with Handel,"I just bought this CD set as a replacement for an old cassette version that I'd simply worn out after many years. This opera has no dead spots. The music is bright and effervescent, and just rolls right along. It's a beautiful recording with lovely voices and sprightly musicianship, played on period instruments. NOT a big head trip, just fine, fun music. You'll soon find yourself singing in the shower!"
3,Excellent software,"The sections dealing with orbit estimation are very sketchy. Needs to filled out with specific and detailed computational algorithms (e.g. Escobal).Excellent! software, however."
5,Covers Everything I Needed,"I am just a programmer. I use some of the older, classic literature to write algorithms to track low-earth satellites. I'm not a math major. This book is an excellent addition because it helps me to understand how to connect orbital concepts with the math. It is short and to the point. The book's construction quality is excellent!"
5,the best biochem review book,This book is outstanding for use while taking class and then reviewing material for Boards. Clear and concise. The diagrams are clear and somehow stick in your head. Questions at end of chapters are really good. Good explanations too. Easy to read. Better than Lippincott for Board review...many more questions and more high yield material.
4,Good Book,"It's a good to help review before a test. Not very good for intro biochemistry (amino acids, protein structures, post-translational modification, etc). Has good clinical applications."
3,Too old,"Buy the new one. The older version (Version 3) is far inferior to the new one (Version 4). Regardless neither version was extremely helpful or relative to my class, however they might come in handy when studying for boards (I am keeping my book till then)."
3,Fun but not exactly what I wanted.,"As a former cheerleading coach, I was looking for some simple instruction for my grand-daughters who are in elementary school but into gymnastics. It was OK, but I was looking for more cheer routines they could learn from and more information on correct positions."
2,MEDIOCRE,"NOT THE BEST OR THE WORST, JUST DID NOT KEEP MY DAUGHTER AND HER FRIENDS ATTENTION LONG ENOUGH OR ENGAGING TO WANT TO TRY AGAIN. SHE HAS WATCHED THE VIDEO LESS THAN A HANDFUL OF TIMES. WANTED TO LOVE IT, BUT THE GIRLS WERE NOT IMPRESSED."
5,Good video,This is a good instructional video it starts out slow with very basic cheerleading skills and how to perform them correctly. It then progresses to more advanced moves and also shows how to do them right.
5,Greek and Roman Plays,"I bought a copy of this book several years ago, but decided when I moved that it was one thing I could sacrifice. Unfortunately I regreted this decision and when I checked, it was a terribly expensive book to replace. I checked Amazon and was able to get a replacement copy second hand for about 14 dollars.......Lucky Me!!!"
3,Bali the Hollywood way,"This video does a good job in explaining the variety of Balinese culture and geography. The pace and tempo kept me interested but the information was a bit shallow. But how much can one say in 1 hour on Bali. I've lived there since 1974 and reside also in California, when i do miss Bali I throw this video in the VCR to remind me of Bali"
5,Great multi-function player,It took a lot of searching to find a player that would play from a memory card and didn't cost an arm and a leg. This player lives up to my expectations. It is currently doing slideshow duty attached to the back of a TV in the corporate lobby.
5,Relible and Easy to use,"I liked the item, and I gave as a gift to a friend. He likes it so much too in comparison to the Philips, this one is reliable and cheaper with USB capability."
1,USB port does not work,"I have been able to play movies from DVD or SD card. Cannot use USB to view picture in JPEG (accepted format). Called COBY, who said they would replace it but that I had to pay for forward and return shipping. Since I bought this item for its good price, and since it's performing well as a DVD player, I have decided to keep it.I was tempted to rate it higher, but the simply MALFUNCTIONAL USB port warrants the lowest ranking."
2,Coby TF-DVD7377 7-Inch DivX Compatible Portable DVD,"I gave it a 2/5 because I don't think the company is seriously about quality. The biggest disappointment I had with this portable DVD is its inability to use the A/V input. Make no mistake about it, it has the A/V input and output switch, but the A/V input simply doesn't work. The box/manual never confirms it has or not, but it has the notation ""--"". The 2 dashes tell me nothing. I called their support - 1st, not sure. 2nd try - it doesn't support A/V input. I went on and ask what's the A/V input for - he (support) said I don't know. It sounds like it's time to push the product out to market, and they could carless about a defect (the AV input) used by less (say 10%) ppl use it."
5,Better than i expected,"i really like this portable dvd, because i use it to play video-music with a 4GB usb memory and i can store about 80 video-songs, im gona buy a 8GB usb memory now that they are cheaper, with this memory you don't scratch DVD's and you can delete and add new songs easily, i download'em from youtube and convert them to divx, you can also make folder for the songs and it recongnize'em and play the folder that you want, something else wath i did is that i conect the audio from the DVD to the car stereo spekers, you need somebody that knows how to do this job and you need to plan a good area to hold the DVD so it will not be in your way."
5,Excellent Divx Player,"This player exceeded my expectations. I expected it to play my divx files, which it does wonderfully. It outputs to TV and has a nice and easy to use remote. It came with all the necessary cables and was extremely easy to set up. It plays my regular DVD movies with ease.The drawbacks? If you pause for too long, even when not using the battery, the unit shuts off after a while. If I have to walk away for 15 minutes, I'd like to resume when I return. There is no option to keep power on. Occasionally, a disc won't play right until I remove and reinsert the disc, although the menu has displayed perfectly.Still, I'm very very happy with this unit and highly recommend it."
2,Portable DVD,"The devise is compatible with all media types as declared. The only problem, that after 3 month of use is started to show strange lines and ""pausing"" while playing. I'm writing letter to the manufacturer right now.Update: The manufacturer said is nothing to do, the warranty covers only 90 days.This player is not good purchase - do not buy it."
1,Crap,"This thing broke on me the 4th time I used it, it wouldnt turn on. Its nice that it has the USB and SD card slots, so you can see any pictures you take. I am surprised at the other reviews, I thought the screen quality was lousy. Wouldve sent it back, but didnt get around to it on time. Next time I am just getting something that plays DVDs, the SD slots are nice but not what you will be doing most of the time (at least me)."
2,You get what you pay for,"After taking this player for a test drive on a plane trip, realized it's not the player for me.Pros: Video quality is decent. Speaker quality and volume is pretty good for small speakers. Ability to read images off SD cards is nice. Charges to full battery pretty quickly. Two stereo headphone jacks is a plus.Cons: Battery life barely lasts through a 2 hour movie. Couldn't make it through 40 Year Old Virgin without dying and that's using headphones the whole time. Play resume function didn't seem to work reliably when powering off the unit. Had to turn the volume up to the max to hear it over the noise of the plane. Unit feels a little plasticy and cheap and the latch to close it needs to be readjusted every time you want to shut the unit again.Overall, meh.... gonna try the Sony next."
3,"Good player, but read the fine print!","This works well, and pulls movies from both the USB and SD card + the DVD player. The screen and sound are good.But be careful! I'm actually annoyed with Amazon, because they advertise SDHC cards (like the 8Gb ones) on the same page as an ""accessory"" for this item, but in reality the unit will only read from regular SD cards (i.e. 2Gb or smaller). So now I have an 8Gb card (that I bought from Amazon when I bought the unit) and it's full of movies that the unit won't read. Annoying."
2,disappointed on receiving a faulty product,"this model has good features and is value-for-money, as it hasa swivel-able screen, usb and sd card support, all that i wanted.but my only mistake before gifting it was to not have tried it out.to my horror i came to know that it couldn't play a standard dvdand was showing a flicker on the screen with an uncontrollable 2Xrewind due to some malfunction. the moment the dvd starts playingit plays for a second and rewinds at 2X i tried pressing allbuttons but to no effect.i'm embarrassed and have got this product to India and gifted it now,will have to return it back and get it exchanged as it is in warranty.bottom-line: no doubt about features or value-for-money, but make sureyou try the product as soon as you purchase it and before you gift it."
2,portable dvd plyr,great great greatplays my all dvds including dvd+ ntsc pal etc on my big tv screen too!!plays my 8gb usb having all kind of formates.cute portable.remote works from 8 ft. may be more.i cold not find volume controll on remote.reducing stars because wire which developed defect was not replaced by seller sayinh MORE THAN 7 DAYS HAVE PASSED AND IT CAN NOT BE REPLACEDREAD MY REVIEW OF PYLE BACK UP CAMERA TOO!!!!!
5,Coby TF-DVD7377 7-Inch,"Great little player, Only unit to play all disc type.My only wish is for Coby to make a 10"" player with all these features"
3,Portable dvd player,"I like the DVD player, unfortunately, the fast forward button does not work. Besides that I'm still enjoying it."
2,Save for the SDHC capabilty,"This is a piece of junk. The screen is intermittent and bad qualtiy. The disc stops working with very very little usage. If not for the SDHC capability, I would rate this a one star."
4,Skeptical,I was skeptical buying such a cheap unit. I have been pleasantly surprised. the picture is great and all the features work well.
2,Coby portable DVD player,I used the unit to play books recorded on CD's (MP3). It worked well for 30 days. Then it stopped working.It also has the annoying problem of of not returning to the place where you stopped. Thus necessitating fast forward to your place.Am trying to get a replacement.
1,non-functionable after 1 month,"This was a gift to my daughter in Utah ... I send her $100.00 every month to help her out in this recession. She has no car (walks to work and everywhere else).I believed at the time, that I was giving her one of the best available portable dvd plavers ... guess not.Thank God I got the warrantee!!!!"
1,Returned DVD player...,"The sound worked, but there was no video, it was exactly what I had wanted to get my daughter and family for Christmas. BUT Christmas morning it was a disappointment when it didn't work."
4,Versatile product for the money,"This player is nice, the build quality leaves a little to be desired, but for the price it's alright. Great features and it plays everything I've thrown at it so far via DVD, USB and SD. Recognizes SDHC cards (I use an 8gb) full of Divx files no prob and plays them back to back without having to use the controls or remote. This is a great feature because we use it for our daughter in the car with the included headrest bag (nice accessory), but in order to use the bag you have to swivel the screen 180 degrees and fold it back on the main unit (works well).Overall a great a great buy for the money, hopefully it lasts."
2,Unreliable,"Theoretically this is a great product. All the good stuff that has been said is pretty much true.However...The first one I bought lasted about 6 months. Then, it just quit playing dvd's, cd's. So I bought another one. August 30,2008. November 1, 2008 it simply doesn't even play any kind of disk. Bought it brand new. 2 in a row???Maybe I should change the title to Reliable - you may rely on it to crash.Fortunately, I bought a 2-year replacement plan (after the product's 1-year warranty). Wish me luck.Amazon's customer service, by the way, has always been top-notch."
1,Complete Garbage!,"This thing is complete garbage! I had reservations on buying a no name brand player in the first place, and was considering the Sony equivalent. I decided on this one because of the good reviews, and it was cheaper than the Sony. Boy am I ever sorry about going with this one! First off, the battery never worked, so it had to be plugged in at all times. After about 90 days, it just died completely. It is very hard to find any warranty information on this thing, but it is 90 days. Coincidence!? I don't think so. That is about how long the manufacturer expects this thing to last, and this one stuck to the plan. I bought a Sony at Costco to replace the $100 I lost on this piece of sh**! Don't waste your money and buy this!!"
3,Doesnt work after warranty period,"Very interesting device. It is what we were looking for for the kids in the car. Simple, with a remote control, possibility to use USB drives or SD cards.It worked just fine for the first 6 months but it stoped reading sd cards and usb drives one day and I have no use for it anymore unless I play DVDs.I ve read in some forums it happened the same to other people.Unfortunatelly the warranty period they have for these devices is just 90 days."
2,Didn't last long,"We bought two of these units for our kids, and one has stopped working. When discs are loaded, the unit continues to display ""no disc."" We didn't get it for anything except playing DVDs, so it's now completely useless to us. The kids took good care of the players, so I can't blame the problem on abuse.While I realize they are a fairly inexpensive product, I was hoping for a little more. I liked that these units came with adapters for use in the car and home. It didn't take my kids long to understand how to use them.I am curious at how the positive reviewers felt six months or a year later because I have read elsewhere about this product failing. A 90-day warranty is basically useless."
5,Excellent!,"Very impressive! Plays them all, then some more... Download any AVI movie, drag it to your USB drive and it will play with no problems. No need to convert your movie to DVD format and no need to burn/waste the disk! Or, you can burn 4-5 AVI movies onto DVD-R disk as data without any conversion, and then play them from the disk if you don't have USB drive. Love it.On the top of that, when I use USB stick to play movies or music, the batteries last much longer, because there is no need to spin the disk and power up reading head, all that consume a lot of power, but not when you use USB drive. So, it's win-win situation. It plays any region and any system disks too. You can't go wrong with this one."
1,CRAPY,"This item has never worked properly from the very beginning. We bought it on the 24th of Nov. for Christmas. We used it on NEW YEARS DAY. It would freeze and not read dics. We've tried every disc in our library, 200. It would only play 30 and then freeze on half of those. We now have to pay to return and if we are lucky, we get a whoppin 1/2 of the sale price back. STAY AWAY from this product."
1,YES IT IS CHEAP,COBY PRODUCTS ARE GREAT FOR THE FIRST TWO WEEKS WHEN MOST PEOPLE WRITE A REVIEW. IT WILL NOT LAST MUCH LONGER AND THE COMPANY DOES NOT STAND BEHIND THE WARRANTY.
2,Not that great,"First off, this case is cheaply made and doesn't really fit the PSP well. I have a PSP Slim and if you put it in the case as it is, the PSP will move around inside if you tip it upside down or to the side. It's like you found some little case to use on a PSP that really isn't made for a PSP. Description says room for 2 UMD's, but I guess they mean just laying them in the bottom of the case and sitting your PSP system directly on top of them. Poor design and mine came already scratched up in the cheap plastic packaging."
2,get something else,"This book reviews II Samuel and looks at the last half of David's life. (No Goliath story). The questions mainly ask what happened in the passages. There are few thought provoking or group discussion questions.I think this is better suited to an indivdual study rather than a group. If you are looking for a group study guide, get something else."
2,Very messy story line.,"Sorry, I did not like this story line. The subject of the story, ""amber"", was confusing so that I could never get a grip on what she was talking about. The story built around it was just as sloppy."
2,plot is hard to follow; characters are not that likable,lowell's description of the characters become repetitive throughout the entire book. the plot is a little hard to follow. i feel i needed to have a more than solid understanding of wordly events. scenes dragged on a little without enough emphasis on the characters and how they are growing together throughout the story. ending was not satisfactory for all the reading that i did.
1,I WAS SOOOO BORED!,"I did not enjoy this book. I did not feel attuned with the characters, as I usually do when I read a very good book. I found all the scenes dealing with amber to be quite long and tedious. Granted, they're meant to be informative, but I felt that they made the story drag. This book just didn't click with me. I was a bit disappointed since I usually enjoy Elizabeth Lowell's work. I was tempted to buy ""Jade Island"", the sequel to ""Amber Beach"", but I dare not risk another boring read. Sorry, Elizabeth."
2,Needed more romance and less history,I am a avid fan of Elizabeth Lowell and this book was not up to par. Thank God I did not buy it in hard cover. I would have been very disappointed to have paid such a price for this book
5,Book in excellent shape,"This book was for someone else, but I was extremely pleased with the way it looked. It was a used book, but it really did look new."
2,"A dissertation on amber, boats and fishing...","That's what I felt like this book was, with a bit of hot sex thrown in. Disappointed because Lowell can do so much better. At least this book was a bit better than 'Jade Island', but not by much. If you want to learn IN EXCRUTIATING DETAIL about amber, boats and fishing then read this book otherwise don't bother. (Same goes for 'Jade Island' EXCRUTIATING DETAIL about jade and Chinese culture, plus offensive dialogue) If you want GOOD Lowell material, go back and read her ""Only"" or ""Untamed"" series, they are MUCH better and believe it or not they have some ROMANCE!"
3,Another delight from Elizabeth Lowell,"Though I preferred Jade Island and Pearl Cove to this first book in the Donovan series, it was still an enjoyable read involving international intrigue, quick wit, and explosive emotions. The plot moved quickly and the history Lowell provides about amber is interesting without being overwhelming or tedious. I have only two complaints. One, though Lowell has depicted Honor as a clever-tongued, intelligent woman, there are a couple of instances in which Honor is so naive as to be downright foolish, and the inconsistency leaves the reader shaking their head. Second, since brothers Kyle and Archer make only a short appearance at the end of the novel, I didn't feel as drawn into the close, fun-loving Donovan family as I did in Jade Island and Pearl Cove. Overall though, I'd recommend it and read it again myself."
4,I FOUND THIS BOOK VERY INTERESTING AND A NICE LOVE STORY,THIS BOOK WAS DIFFERENT AND INTERESTING. I ENJOYED THE LOVE STORY VERY MUCH - IT WAS NOT THE TYPICAL ROMANCE. IT WAS VERY ENJOYABLE AND I LOOK FOWARD TO READING THE SEQUEL -JADE ISLAND.
2,What happened here?,"I am hopeless college student and have been an Elizabeth Lowell fan for almost five years. I usually can't put down her books. I bought this book about a month ago and still haven't finished it. There is definitely something wrong here. I am used to her characters being deeper more mature than these characters were. Hopefully, her next one will be a lot better than this one."
2,Not what I expected from Elizabeth Lowell,"Like other reviewers, I have read many if not most of Elizabeth Lowell's works. This book was not up to her usual standard. The plot was labrinthine, the romance limited, and the characters boring. I'd rather reread the ""Only"" series than this tripe. Get it from the library rather than shelling out good money."
5,Amber Beach,This is the first book I read in the Donovan family series. They wrap you up in the family and keep you hooked. There is some hot romance and a pretty good plot.
1,Amber beach,Elizabeth Lowell has absolutely awesome research in each Donovan series book. Excellent reading with lively plots to keep the reader interested.
1,"Sorry, but I didn't like this series,","I probably stand alone with my review of this book but I didn't like this series. I thought the story was predictable and boring. I was very disappointed. As a rule, I enjoy most books written by Elizabeth Lowell just not this series. Sorry."
5,I loved the book!,This book takes some characters and ties some history into it. It involved intrigue and some suspense. I believe it is well worth the time. I wasn't disappointed and I'm glad in this case I didn't listen to the other people who reviewed it.
2,The same old low fat advice which only increases BS levels!,"I cannot fathom why the medical field along with dietitians continue to advise diabetics to eat low fat and to eat grains and fruit. Any experienced diabetic who tests regularly knows that the only true way to lowering blood sugar levels is to eat low carb (and NOT low fat). As a calorie is a calorie, so is a carb a carb as far as a most diabetics go. Obviously a serving of broccoli is better than one of cake, however, intake of carbohydrates will raise blood sugars (it depends on portion). This is simplified however, new diabetics, your best bet is to test, test, test. I guarantee, you will see lower numbers when you eliminate most bread, pasta, and keep fruit portions tiny. You will also stop having carb cravings and lose weight. Bottom line, look at labels and account for all carbs (not just sugar)."
3,UMMMM,This movie is ok. There wasnt a real set plot it felt like it was just filming scenes and sticking them together.
2,Not worth it,"If you're looking to learn how to play songs from Are You Experienced, you're better off buying Andy Aledort's ""Jimi Hendrix - A Step By Step Breakdown of His Guitar Styles and Techniques"" book and CD for [PRICE]. The problem with this DVD is that while Andy obviously knows his stuff, he spends less than 5 minutes per song (they cram all 17 songs into 2 hours) and there's no real ""analysis"" of how to even play it. What's worse is that there's no on-screen transcription of what Andy is playing -- he just plays and you're expected to mimic what you see. You might as well get a Hendrix concert DVD and learn from that. A better idea would have been to package the book I mentioned above with this DVD."
3,delete Velvert....,It was a big mistake to include Velvert Turner in the release. He's a huge distraction who contributes little aside from awkwardly reading things obviously written for him. Andy Aledort is mute throughout the DVD but it's he who undoubtedly did all the work and he should have had the freedom to present this material as he saw fit. I guess Velvert is a family friend who knew Jimi at some point?The DVD's really for entertainment and curiosity purposes.....
4,all visuals no narrative,"I have the other ""official"" Jimi Hendrix Experience instructional DVD, the one based on electric lady land, with the same guy, Andy, doing the guitar. On the lady land one, Andy walks you through everything, showing the fingering and providing a narrative on what's going on, often saying which string and fret to play on. This DVD only shows you his hands; so if you are good at following someone's fingers, without any verbal clues, this is a great DVD. I find parts of it to be dead easy, and parts seriously challenging. But for pieces like Red House, this is as good as it gets."
1,Should have known better!!!! Waste of $50!!BUY THE BOOK!!!,"I should have listened to some of the bad reviews. One review said that they spend about 5 minutes per songs. I think it's more like 4. They don't ""Teach"" you anything. They just show you how Jimi played the song. Thats great and all but I'm not Jimi Hendrix. I would like to learn how to play like him, but the DVD does not teach. It actually gets annoying after a while because Velvert Turner, just keeps saying. Jimi then does this, Jimi then does that. Like I said before I'm not Jimi. The guitarist that plays the guitar to show you what Velvert Turner is talking about, just plays. I have to constantly play the DVD in slow motion but then I can't hear the sound. I hate this product. I also bought the book because the book has the TAB's and sheet music for the songs. The Book is excellent. I wish I had never bought the DVD, I spent $50 and I can't return it. BUY THE BOOK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,How great......still need tabs to find out how to play !!,I agree with the comment of Lloyd Gomez. A total waste of your money !!!!!
4,Martin van Buren,A good book about one of America's first true machine politicians. Again of the American Presidency Series a somewhat short book of the intrigues of American Politics
5,Try it with coffee,I used sometimes with coffee and if you don't believe me try it. The best coffee you drink is with goat milk and not cow's milk.hakim talbi
1,TOO TIGHT!!,THIS CAP WAS WAY TOO SMALL FOR MY HEAD. I ALSO BOUGHT THE BLACK CAP AND IT FIT JUST RIGHT. THE ELASTIC ON THE RED CAP SEEMED TO BE SEWN IMPROPERLY.
4,Great for making a Mario hat!,"Used this hat as the base for my Mario costume.I simply bought some cheap felt squares at the craft store and cut out the M logo and used some craft glue to glue it onto the front of the hat.Everyone loved the way it came out and it was much cheaper than buying the cheap looking premade Mario hat.The hat seemed to be of good quality and fit well, it has an elastic band to fit multiple head sizes.Overall its a great hat."
5,Perfect find !!,This is what my nephew has been looking for; we were surprised to find this great looking hat. The quality is very well made.
1,Too small. Not Cotton.,The cap is too small even with the elastic fully stretched.I ordered the hat believing it was cotton but it is NOT cotton.
5,"Mario, cheap.",Works for Mario and came in a reasonable amount of time. I would buy it again if I ever lost my current cap and wanted to be Mario again for Halloween. Did I mention it was cheap?
5,Love this hat.,Got the hat for Super Mario costume and ended up loving it just as it was. Wear it all the time.
2,it's ok.,"feels pretty rough. i figured since it says its 100% cotton, it would feel a bit softer. the material is a bit thin but the bill feels sturdy. bought this for a kid that loves mario, i'll just need to add an M on it. not too impressed myself."
1,Not worth the money,"The head of this gizmo snapped the second time I used it. It was too inexpensive to warrant the trouble of returning it, but consider my review a word to the wise."
3,Crazy times!,"An interesting survey of the 60s/70s - my own times. Interesting portrayals of people, places and events ,still with me now, some weeks after I read it."
4,"Beautiful shoes, well made","I've purchased these for my August, '08 wedding. They were a great! price, are well made and fairly comfortable for 4"" heels. Make no mistake, they ARE high and somewhat fatiguing. (even though I do enjoy wearing heels) I've worn them around the house and for my dress fittings. I plan to get some sort of gel insert for additional cushioning. That should help for the big day and were a huge hit at the bridal salon. Why buy $250 Kate Spades?"
1,ROWING THROUGH,"My name is XENO and I took part as an extra in the movie.Once I sat through the movie, I can safely say that Rowing Through is deadly boring. The movie drags on for ever. To us rowers, it is a known fact, that rowing skills shown by actors in motion pictures are mostly horrible. (The only capable actors were M.Streep and G. Davis.) Besides having made some pocket change back then as an extra, I am VERY HAPPY that NO ONE (in the small world of rowing) can tell that I was even remotely part of this failed attempt to portray a phenomenal Olympic effort.XENO"
2,A flawed effort,"As a former oarsman, this film is a major disappointment. While visually stunning, it suffers from a major flaw: none of the actors can row at a level anywhere close to the one they are supposed to be at. As a result, despite grunting and grimacing, they cannot convey the true spirit of the sport: the combination of pain, power and grace. Besides making the story difficult to believe, it also prevents the director from getting us into a ""rowing rhythm"" as what would otherwise be flowing scenes must be shortened and edited to avoid showing too many obvious ""crabs"". Too bad."
1,"Read ""The Amateurs"" instead","I guess things must balance out for Tiff Wood. After having his Olympic efforts being beautifully chronicled by David Halberstam in ""The Amateurs"", he is portrayed as a childish, selfish buffoon in this pointless movie. The novice level rowing aside, this movie makes ""Oxford Blues"" look like ""Chariots of Fire"" or ""Breaking Away"" as far as a well made, inspiring sports movie. Unfortunately, I know of no decent rowing movie that has been made. ""A Fine Balance"" by Brad Lewis is a very good film but it is a documentary.To summarize, the rowing is terrible, one develops no affection for any of the characters, and the historical facts are skimmed over. Brad Lewis, the only main character in Halberstam's book to win an Olympic gold medal, is mentioned only as ""Paul Enquist's partner"". I consider Mr. Lewis one of the lucky ones in this regard. Save your money and read the book instead. Or you can have my DVD copy for free."
3,"Beautiful visuals, sad story","I felt that there was too much unsaid concerning the relationships among the characters and the circumstances, and that this left the story murky and unsatisfying. Since the book is well rated, I assume that the story was not well translated into film."
3,Works only for silver I-pod,The cases are transparent. Looks weird when you use them on colored I-pod. They are made to work only for basic salver I-pod
3,good but not best,"I am an avid Anne LaMott reader. The commentator who said they were off to read ROSIE will NOT be disappointed. That is an extraordinary book. Although I enjoyed these characters they didn't have the usual depth of LaMott's characters. They were all full of flaws, yes, but I didn't actually believe how they felt about each other. And I could find little in me that even liked Joe Jones. I would've rather seen Louise in a book all by herself. Anyway - I am not swayed from my love of LaMott and her work but this wasn't my fave and I certainly don't reccommend it to forst time readers of her work. Do not stop go - go directly to ROSIE."
2,Dissappointed at best,"After reading Bird by Bird and Operating Instructions, I was thrilled to start on Joe Jones.I've been terribly dissapointed by a flimsy beginning, void of storyline. I've labored through the belly of the book and now find myself wondering whether I'll ever finish it. (doubtful)I still have faith in Anne Lammott so I'll be trying out ""Rosie""... it's hard to imagine that the writer who put out Bird by Bird and made me think and wonder and laugh out loud could have written this boring story where none of the characters mean a thing to me.oh well I guess we're all entitled to bad moments. My advice? don't read this one if you appreciate her work, it might put you off her completely."
1,A painful read,"I had just read my first book from this author entitled ""All new people"" and had loved it when I picked this book up. I hated it. I didn't even finish it. I kept waiting for something to happen and nothing much ever did. I kept reading it thinking that even if nothing happened I would get involved with the characters and cherish the description of their everyday lives but that didn't happen. The writing was just too abstract and.... weird. The characters had some off-kilter characteristics about them that should have been lovable but I just didn't find endearing. Things weren't explained that should have been explained and things that I didn't care about were expanded upon. I was very disappointed since I loved the first book of hers that I had read but I will read others from this author to see if this is the exception or the rule. Overall, an extremely tough book to even start, much less finish."
5,Nujoint capsules take the pain away,These pills are amazing. 3 a day and my arthritis and swelling in fingers disappears. My husband has knee issues and swears that his pain disappeared after 3 days. He just started running again after not being able to for the last 5 years. I have recommended these pills to many people and no one has been disappointed.
2,Not what you get in the picture,"I purchased this thinking I was getting both gonis not just the 180 Goni. I really just wanted the small 360 one. Oh well, it was cheap."
3,It was what I could locate when needed;it was adequate and much better than improvising.,"I bought this while helping a friend add a bath exhaust, where a wall vent was impractical and a roof vent unthinkable.Soffit venting exhausts (properly)was still a misunderstood technique around here; with most relying on standard soffit vents to accept bath exhaust (and to rot out the soffit - but that a bit later and generally unexpected).This worked well to get the exhaust outside the soffit and has held up well. However, it seemed a bit fragile to me, working with it. The bathroom was on the outside wall, so we had no end of obstacles retrofitting the duct through the cramped space in the attic. It was probably having to work with it in an awkward situation that gave me the impression of less than robust construction; probably unreasonable, in retrospect. I'm sure it would be perfectly serviceable in new construction.Incidentally, I still regularly see these ducts improperly vented into the soffit."
4,"Good, simple, daily affirmations","I purchased ABCs To Positive Living last fall. I began to use it every morning and night and have noticed a huge difference in my outlook on life. The affirmations are simple, yet fitting for everyday situations. There are three affirmations for each letter of the alphabet, which helps me to memorize them with ease. Also, the binding on my copy has stayed together quite well over the past several months.The authors also have written other materials, but Creative Works Publishing's web site shows a variety of authors, not just these two. I plan to purchase more of their titles through Amazon.com.I recommend this book to those who need a daily boost!"
3,"Beautiful illustrations, writing is poorly done","I bought this book because I wanted something substantive for the little girls in my life who dream of being princesses... (really, how many tiara's does a four-year old really need?) I read the first few pages and was smitten with the illustrations. They are beautiful. Well done Mr. Collier. Since beautiful illustrations go far in this age range, I would give this book three stars.The Rosa Parks story stands alone as one of substance. But this book falls short of providing a readable story for children. It doesn't flow as good writing should for any age group, but rather jumps around and tries to provide so much data, that it fails to actually tell a story about the great lady it was written to commemorate.If you have enough history about the story and can tell it yourself to your children, the book may be worth buying for the illustrations alone. For my money, I would rather find something that is also a good read for my kids."
3,"Beautiful prose and illustrations, but...","if you're looking for an children's biography of Rose Parks or of the Civil Rights Movement, this books isn't it.Buy it for Giovanni's magical and powerful words.Buy it for Collier's amazing pictures.Don't buy it if it's intended to teach children who are wholly uninformed about American history. I had six immigrant teenagers read this book, and all they could tell me after they were finished was that Rosa Parks was a lady who was thrown off a bus because of white people. They weren't sure why. And then a bunch of people walked to Washington D.C. afterwards, but they weren't sure how this connected to Rosa getting thrown off the bus. In the end the teens were really confused."
4,Rosa,"Good book, beautiful artwork. Get the book if nothing else for the pictures. The book itself was ok, it was a little jumpy and didn't go into very much detail of the actual event. However, it is a nice book for young children who don't need or want much detail."
4,Rosa,"Everyday Rosa Parks rode the bus to work. There was a black and white section. She sat down in the neutral section and a man didn't want her to, but she stayed and got arrested. She was arrested for the wrong reason. People made signs and walked to support Rosa. They stopped riding the bus too.I liked the book. The pictures were good. I learned that white and black people were separated. That's wrong. Since I read the book, I now want to watch a movie and learn more about Rosa Parks."
3,Great book-Poor binding,"It is a well-written book with great illustration. However, the second time I picked it up to read to my granddaughter, the inside pages fell away from the cover."
3,Beautiful Illustration,"Rosa is a story about Rosa Parks' fateful day on the bus. I like that this story gave a little more background into Rosa Parks herself and how she was from day to day. It added a little something different from the other versions of Rosa Parks' story. The illustrations were my favorite part. I love the texture each page has with the different patterns. The warm colors on every page gave a very relaxed and calm feel when I read through the story which followed the author's portrayal of how Rosa Parks was feeling. I will say that as much as I liked the little look into Rosa Parks' life and personality and loved the illustrations, I felt the story would be a little dreary for a child to read. There was no moment when I felt I wanted to keep reading to see what happened, maybe it was because I've heard the story many times now or maybe because the story itself was a bit lackluster."
1,ehh... no,"bought this for my 80gb 5.5 gen ipod, and it fit fine, i used the right back, but it wouldnt come out of the case! it was stuck, and when i called belkin for help all i got was 3 hours on hold!ablsolutely horrible, i dont know if the 30 gb works any better, ut stay away from this case"
5,Pomp and Circumstance with Panache!,"These invitations are phenomenal! They're unique, classy and very easy to print. The tassels take some time to put on, but the final effect is well worthwhile! For wording ideas, check out ""verseit.com."""
3,Not so much about writing a story,"This is a pleasant read. However, I purchased it to influence my students to write stories, and this book is more about the influence of friends than story writing."
4,Invicta 3215,"I am very pleased with this time piece. You have to be careful with the band release, however, it's a very attractive high quailty watch."
4,Very nice attractive watch; excellent bracelet,"This is a very nice watch; has a great solid feel. This is not a lightweight watch. Great shiny finish on the metal and the crystal is domed, not flat, creating a bit of a magnifying effect. The face has very nice detail and the chronograph feature works well. This watch has a fantastic bracelet! Very nice feel to it. I've not had any problem with the clasp popping open; mine works very well. This is a lot of watch for a great price and it looks great."
4,nice watch,"my band does not pop open so maybe I got a more sturdy clasp or the build of my wrist does not cause it to pop open. I purposely tried to pop it open by moving my wrist all around and nada. Maybe the other reviewer got a bad clasp or has a differnt shaped wrist. This watch fits well, not too large or small and very sharp looking. I wish it came with half links but still got a decent fit."
2,not as good as Larry Ullman,"While this book covers both ASP and PHP coding and the use of MySQL and ACCESS, the author does little to explain the 'why' behind much of the coding. This means that using the coding is not as straightforward as she would like it to be.To start a book with the basics of HTML and then take a user through to complex database design would require more explanation and peripheral information.I find that Larry Ullman's books provide far better explanations of the coding and help the user to understand how the coding fits in with a) the rest of the coding on the page and b) the coding that relates to subsequent pages.I used this book as a textbook in a class, and most students encountered similar problems. If someone were to purchase this book, I strongly recommend another more hands-on book in tandem with it."
4,dog cookie cutter Dachshund,I used the dachshund cutter only once but I love the cutter. It looks like the real dachshnd dog.
1,Awful - Terrible - Waste of Money,"When I first started listening, I was reminded of the Junior High music teacher duo skit on Saturday Night Live. I should have known what was coming when the liner notes added the phrase ""(as made famous by)"" in front of each song's supposed performer. The tracks are digitally created instruments (on the first disc). The recording quality is way below par. The mic placement is totally wrong. The mix is shabby and un-balanced. The third disc (Celtic Harp) is the best of the three until they hit gut-wrenching sour notes at critical phrasing points. I'm looking forward to using these discs as expensive targets at the shooting range."
1,horrible.,"pretentious, pretending, purity wannabe, bored-to-death songs, one after another. i'd rather hear myself singing in the shower. could hardly hold back the yawns again and again. i got teary eyes not from the songs but by my constant yawns. as boring as listen to those catholic priests reciting latin mumbo-jumbo in the church on the x'mas eve, or monks in the temple or monastery singing mantras."
5,THE inspirational album,"Two Wolves by John Flynn is the most inspirational album I have heard in a long time. Each one of these songs has a very clear, important message. While each of these messages is different, they are each equally powerful. His music grabs hold of you and gives you something to think about as well as lifting your spirit. ""Two Wolves"", ""Dover"", ""Blink"", and his version of ""Hall of Angels"" are beautifully performed. I highly recommend this CD to everyone."
5,"Thanks, John","Some of my favorite singers have been Harry Chapin, Phil Ochs, Jim Croce, and Phil Ochs. I never thought I'd have the opportunity to listen to a living singer touch me like those men did. John Flynn is like all four rolled into one, yet remains an individual artist. This recording is great!"
1,don't waste your money,"I have now bought 4 of these and 3 of them did not work. I am so disappointed in them-Amazon made it really easy for me to return, but ""Coach Dave"" should also be reviewing the product and should make sure junk isn't being sent to customers who are looking forward to their products. I even reached out to Coach Dave and his website and I have yet to hear back from them. They seem to be really professional about their products and they have done nothing be let a customer down."
2,Great idea Poor life span,"The Unit died after one season, This was not a battery issue. the unit simply died. the features are good but it gives balls/stikes in a percentage not an actually B/S type count which is not ideal for me."
4,Cool album!,The most memorable songs from this album are DON'T FIGHT IT which marks the solo debut of Journey frontman Steve Perry in a duet with Kenny Loggins. Also I GOTTA TRY written by Loggins and his close friend ex-Doobie Brother Michael McDonald. McDonald also recorded the track for his solo debut IF THAT'S WHAT IT TAKES. HEARTLIGHT was also a Top 20 hit. The other songs are good.
4,Great for eczema,"My one year old has a pretty bad case of eczema, and this is the only lotion that I have found to show marked improvement in his condition. I use it in combination with the Aquaphor gentle wash for a one, two punch. My only complaint is that it is so greasy."
2,Mistitled and disappointing,"Fans of the original work and its groovy synths will be disappointed to learn that it has been cut up by the various artists. The original music isn't presented unedited, so the average listener won't have any idea what it sounded like unless he happens on a vinyl copy of the album. The closest comparison we have is the Futurama theme song, which stretches fair-use laws to rework ""Psyche Rock."""
1,Printing was backwards and upside down.,The printing was backwards and upside down. To read the book. I had to turn it over and begin at the end turn the pages in reverse. It was too much trouble to box it up and return it so I will just live with it.
3,complex,"Bit long, overly complex for anyone not familiar with this part of the world, too many characters (who was that? how is he/she connected to...? why are we here again?). Frankie Machine's a better read."
2,A literary 2x4 to the head- not for the squeamish,"I've read other novels written by Don Winslow and enjoyed them, most notably The Winter of Frankie Machine. Not so this time around- Power of the Dog bludgeons the reader from the first page and never lets up- savage beatings, torture, gruesome murders of women and children, the ravages of drug addiction- and delivered in hundreds of one-sentence paragraphs. I just wanted to put the book down and take a nice, long shower. The world of narcotics trafficking seeems ripe for a great thriller, but this isn't it."
2,Disappointing,This was recommended to me as THE BOOK to understand the drug culture and big time cartel system in Mexico. All I got out of it was old news and overwrought soap opera characters.
2,Let Down,"Don Winslow seems to write in two completely different voices, voices so different that it is hard to believe these books are by the same person. If you liked ""California Fire and Life,"" you will be very disappointed in ""Power of the Dog."" If you liked ""The Death and Life of Bobby Z,"" then you may enjoy ""The Dog.""Unfortunately, the voice I liked was the original, snappy one that gave ""California Fire and Life"" one of the sparkiest openings I've ever read. ""Bobby Z"" seemed standard and disappointing-albeit busy and bloody-and I didn't finish it. ""Power of the Dog"" covers twenty-five years of battling Mexican drug cartels, including the death-by-torture of DEA agent Enrique Camarena in the 1980s. Ambitious, but ultimately pretty standard. If you want a really, really scary look at the Mexican cartels, read Arturo Perez-Reverte's ""Queen of the South."""
1,Poor translation of Mexican Terms,"Translation of Mexican terms could not be worse, I started in the prologue, and had to stop inmediately when I read ""cuerno de chiva"" instead of ""cuerno de chivo"" (correct term in mexico for AK-47), this was done repeatedly over thefirstfew pages.Further more, at the end of this section, they write ""El poder d'el cerro"" when its quite obvious that they are trying to refer to the tittle in spanish ""El Poder del Perro"". Maybe I bought the wrong edition, but the poor use of Mexican terms makes the book seem stupid. One would think the author would investigate a little bit better when writing about country.Complete turn off."
2,years preparing this?,"Gripping. Might be. Teenager coincidences (is any american trauma left out?). Naive. But one of the worst characters is a member of opus dei? I read that it took several years to the author to prepare this book, which makes me hesitate even more about the author or the editor. I know people who join the opus dei, and they can be nice or stupid, but there's no place for mafia and CIA members, cold-blooded killers. Maybe in 80 years there is, but not now. So I couldn't buy it any more. By the way, not a single word in Spanish is spelled correctly."
4,Excelent novel,Based on actual events is a great way of understanding War on Drugs and the rise of mexican cartels. Deep and carefully crafted characters and a moving story. It has some flaws in historical accuracy and mexican idiomatic expressions but nevertheless an excelent novel.
3,The Power of The Editor?,"This book a a ramshackle, hectoring lecture on the failed drug war. While I agree with most of the author's points, I was looking for a good novel, not an essay with plot points thrown in - almost at random - to advance the story. We have a Green Beret, Made Mafia wise guy who works for the CIA and pops up like Obi Wan Kenobi anywhere in the world to move the story along. If that is not good enough, turns out that he is a member of Opus Dei. That's when Winslow lost me. I give him credit for great writing, (some) well developed character and excellent research. But, it just became a mush for me. By the way, our stone cold killer uses a .22 in a firefights to take down armored guys across the room. Really? I wish a good editor had pushed Winslow to tighten this up."
5,Action packed,"This is the first time I have read Don Winslow. He's good, very good. I burned through this epic tale of grim carnage in the drug trade centered around Mexico. Without preaching, the author makes you reflect on whether the war on drugs is worth it."
4,Facts fictionalized..,"at a fast pace. I wonder when HBO will grab this for a few seasons worth of action and intrique? If so much of this hadn't hit the papers, we wouldn't believe it. Well done."
5,WOW! An Absolute Page Turner...,"If you are interested in this genre, read this excellent story. I won't review the details as others have already. TPOTD is a fast moving, action packed, educational, stay up late 'page turner'. I have read lots on the subject matter offered here, and the 5 stars for ""The Power of The Dog"" are not exagerations.I'm ready for Frankie Machine; Winslow is really good!"
5,Sets the Standard for a Great Thriller,"Amazon recommended ""The Power of the Dog"" after I had purchased ""Beat the Reaper"" by Josh Bazell. As soon as I began reading, I couldn't put it down. I didn't want it to end. This is the thriller/mystery book that I compare all others to. So far, nothing has left a bigger impression on me.First, the elements of Italian mobsters and Mexican cartels immediately makes for a great story. Add in Winslow's writing style and suspense, and it's a recipe for a truly awesome book. The characters are well-developed, both the good guys and bad. I don't claim to be an expert on book reviews, I am just a person who enjoys a good thriller that grips you from the start.I read every other Don Winslow book after this one, and he is absolutely my favorite author. But this book is the best of them all. I highly recommend it to anyone like me, looking for a captivating book that you can't put down."
4,fast paced and captivating,"there is a lot going on in this book but Winslow weaves it all together masterfully. I ordered this after reading Savages and The Kings of Cool because i wanted to see what else Winslow had to offer. Its obvious that this guy has done his homework on the drug trade and the cartels in Mexico. I buy books to read while im on the elliptical at the gym to make the time go by faster, and on many occasions my time would be up and i'd still be standing there motionless on the machine while i kept reading because its tough to tear yourself away. i'd definitely recommend it."
5,Great read!,"Excellent story, well written. I took this with me on vacation to Mexico, coincidentally, it was a perfect pool side read. I was entertained from start to finish."
5,Brilliant but on the violent side.,"My introduction to Don Winslow came viaSavages: A Novel. And while I liked ""Savages"" enough to look into his other novels, ""The Power of the Dog"" is, at least to me, vastly superior. Although the staccato writing style is somewhat similar, Winslow isn't as over the top with it in this work. Moreover, the subject matter is fascinating. Winslow obviously did a great deal of research to piece it all together and took the time to craft a great storyline. It reads like a fleshed out non-fiction work more than anything else and that's largely due to Winslow's incredible gifts as an author. The book does have scenes of graphic violence, but I'm not sure how you could write an honest book about the cartels and drug trade without including them. If you're interested in historical fiction, history of the drug trade/cartels/government, or just a fan of well written fiction, consider giving it a read. I don't think that you'll regret it."
3,"Gripping story, terrible spelling","The plot is beautifully developed and I couldn't stop reading it!However, I must say the Kindle edition has ample room for improvement. There were typos all over, and not one Spanish word was spelt right. Definitely not worth the money, I thought I was paying for an edited, published book, but the Kindle edition certainly is not. I haven't read any book by this author in paperback, so I can still hope those editions do not have the spelling issues."
4,helpful book for the most part,"Although it is an old book, marriage has been the same for years so what does it matter. The book overall is full of a lot of common sense things for those who are in good relationships already - but the points are still great reminders- and it is all backed up scripturally. If you have no one in your life to talk to about this kinda stuff...this is a great choice."
5,WOW! What a great book.,"This is just the book I've been looking for. I've bought other books on Russia that explained the change from communism to capitalism but they only told how it affected the government. I wanted to know how it affected the people. This book does that. Although there is a lot of text, there are a lot of pictures. Between the two, it tells the story. The only thing is I wish it was more recent. It was published in 2001. I'm sure some more recent stories have been put out by the author in the National Geographic Magazine. I strongly recommend this book to anyone interested in Russia and geography."
3,"bonecrushingly slanted, I get the message","astonishingly shocking at times and bland at others, is this the Russia of modern day or is this the image the author sees? Certainly the latter and probably not the former. Wonder how the people of Russia feel about this commentary in pictures on their existence? Bleak and disheartening comes to mind. Could a similar tome be assembled on America...of course if one looks hard enough at any topic the horror can be visualized."
2,wrong focus!,"No doubt, Gerd Ludwig is a very talented photographer. However the Russia he shows is packaged to fit expectations of a clueless Westerner. Ludwig shows the disgusting reality, the poverty, and philistine Russian entrepreneurs to contrast all this. A perfect photojournalistic essay!Ludwig is himself clueless. By bringing up all the dirt he forgets that Russians are much more complex than his ugly pictures. Russians know that they live in substandard material conditions! However the drama is that their will power is so exceptionally strong that they are able to ignore the dirt in life, and enjoy its most wonderful moments: a beautiful sunset, a meadow full of flowers, a pretty cloud. Where is all that in this book? Instead, we see a hustly society that's struggling to be like the West with some dubious success."
1,crushed in transport,"The table was the last in stock at the time, and arrived crushed into splinters on several large edges. We returned it and got the Pottery Barn version for a little more money. I'm glad we got the better one."
2,Looks great from a distance,"I ordered this table in honey and it arrived damaged. Customer Service at the supplier was excellent and they shipped another table to me immediately. The second table also arrived damaged. In both cases the top was split along at least one side starting at a corner (like it had been dropped on a corner). Both tables had damage to the corners on several side and top trundle pieces. One table came with instructions for a mission bench (not the table). Unfortunately, I was told that the table is no longer stocked in the honey finish so the vendor is having UPS pick both damaged tables up from my home (free of charge).The quality of the table is not high, but it is attractive for a play table. I'm disappointed that I wasn't able to get a complete, unbroken table because the look is great--especially for the price. In the case of this table you do get what you pay for. I cannot speak highly enough of customer service at the Amazon vendor, though!"
3,Sweet Jane,I thought the movie was good. I like samantha mathis movies it was diffrent than what movies i seen her in..
3,not what I expected,"Fast and painless.But ordered the newer edition of this cd with more songs and, I assume, better sound quality. Received the earlier, unremastered version without extra tracks, which was available elsewhere on Amazon for $4 less."
3,i liked it,"i like this record. men at work are not bad, but not as good as business as work. it's a band, that is performing in my head right now, and oh yeah, they rock. anyway, get this if you're a rock fan, it's pretty good. better than duran duran."
5,A GREAT AUSSIE BAND,"What can one say about men at work. For any aussie who has travelled and lived in a foreign country ""down under"" is our national anthem. The album is pure AUSSIE class and just simply one of those absolute CLASSIC groups and albums of the 80's. I am a HUGE 80's fan and this particular album you simply just CAN NOT MISS!."
4,Do You come from the land from of Downunder,"Business as Usual is thirty-eight minutes and eleven seconds long and was released on August 24, 1982. Business as Usual reached #1 on the U.S. Billboard 200 Album charts (spent 15 weeks at #1) and went 6x Platinum. Men At Work won a Grammy Award for Best New Artist in 1983. Four of the songs charted from the album. The album has a reggae\New Wave Australian sound to it. The music is good to listen to and I am giving Business as Usual an AA++.Side OneWho Can It Be Now?#46 U.S. Billboard Mainstream Rock Singles#1 U.S. Billboard Pop SinglesI Can See it in Your EyesDown Under#13 U.S. Billboard Adult Contemporary#1 U.S. Billboard Pop Singles#1 U.S. Billboard Mainstream Rock SinglesUnderground#20 U.S. Billboard Mainstream Rock SinglesHelpless AutomationSide TwoPeople Just Love to Play with WordsBe Good Johnny#3 U.S. Billboard Mainstream Rock SinglesTouching The UntouchablesCatch A StarDown By the Sea"
5,Great,"I got this cd for Who can it be now? and Downunder. However, I was very happy to discover that all of the other songs on the album were just as good. You will not be disappointed."
2,it is a cheesy album with the time passed,"I thought back in '82 when this came out that Men at Work were pretty cool but I was 14. What did I know? Now I have to say this album is kind of funny in a ridiculous way. ""i come from a land Down Under""and on and on with the lyrics. Corny---""Who can it be now?"" The paranoid track. And I still remember the stupid video that came with it. OMG give me a frigging break. So you can listen to me or listen to a kid because its a kiddy album. ENJOY!"
5,One of the best albums of all times,Too bad they broke up after 2 blockbuster international albums!! We all miss Men At Work.
4,World-class pop.,"The phenomenal ascent of Men At Work had to be seen to be believed. I was present at their Universal Amphitheater concert during one of the first weeks this album was number one, and I saw a group of guys completely taken aback, but genuinely appreciative towards our applause and enthusiasm.In retrospect, their first album is world-class pop music. It had a definable, unique sound...borrowed from a few sources, sure, but gelling into a wholly original package. The singles were marvelous radio singalongs, but the rest of the album has variety, depth and some impressive musicianship!The remastering has resulted in the crisp sonic reproduction of a sound that will take you back twenty years, in the time span of a sax break. If the name ""Men At Work"" gives you any sort of fond recollections, this will be a most worthwhile purchase."
5,One of The Best Albums in the last 20 years!,"Although the bands popularity has faded through the years, this album is an icon of the 80's. Known for its chart topping songs, the album also boasts 8 other very good songs, such as ""Be Good Johnny"", ""Catch A Star"" and ""Down By The Sea"". This is one of those albums you can put in your CD player and just let it play the whole way through. Most bands like to have a consistant sound, through instuments. This band uses it's vocals from lead singer Colin Hay. The instumentation varies throughout the entire album so it doesn't put in a ""trance"" with the same old sound. If you like musical variety with great vocals, then this is a MUST HAVE for your CD collection."
5,Stands the TIme Test,"This album is much more subtle than was appreciated in 1982. Now, 17 years later, it stands the time test. I got to hear Men At Work at a small concert they put on in Houston in 1999, and they were every bit as good as when I heard them in concert in 1983. This album had the monster hits Who Can It Be Now and Down Under but my favorite song was I Can See It In Your Eyes, the greatest morning ski song ever made. Plug it in when you first hit the slopes for the warm up run--amazing...[Winter kisses when your lips were blue/like chasing wild geese in the snow/Faces, places on the windowpane/but that's a long long time ago.../We go to a restaurant, but you don't like wine/you say it's love you want/but there is no time/I realize/I can see it in your eyes/You're moving on to something more...]"
5,Pot of Gold,"There are so many Australian bands that have a definitive, obscure and original sound. They have an eclectic style, all of their own! Australian bands are not influenced by commercial genre's. Men at work were so popular in the early 80's because there was nothing else like them. You should try to experience other Australian acts, Mental as Anything, Spiderbait, Cold Chisel, Midnight Oil and even todays contemporary bands that dont (but should) gain American radio air-time... but then again it's great to discover something for yourself that doesn't get repeated over and over again. If you want something that you CAN listen to repeatedly, start with a 'Men at Work' album... it's bound to put you in a chilled out mood!"
5,"Men At Work's ""Business"" Is More Than ""Usual""","This album is a milestone in my life. I bought a cassette copy of this when ""Down Under"" was big in early 1983. I wore it out! I later on bought the CD version and my life was complete. Every track is wonderful, from the catchy ""Down Under"" to the metaphoric ""Catch A Star"". The haunting ""Down By The Sea"" really indicates how Colin Hay's voice can wail. Outstanding all around."
4,I liked it,"While I did not read its predacessor ""formally the justice league"" I had no trouble following the joke behind this. Like most comics I enjoy this book contains characters that are under used and under appreciated on the whole, and they are funny. I am disappointed only by the fact that three of the main characters in this, Sue Dinby, Blue Beetle, and Max Lord are all now dead. And others have gone into space (Guy), joined the justice League (power girl), gone a little crazy (Elongated man), or have devolved into the most hateable super hero ever (Booster Gold).This is the last time any of these characters will be able to be funny, and that is a little disappointing. I want there to be more to this series. Discovering this comic was like discovering an old television series that was canceled before its time, you watch the episodes, you like them and then your left wanting more."
3,Not as good as Formerly Known As...,After reading Formerly Known as the Justice League I was expecting something as refreshingly funny and original in this but was disappointed. It is funny (at times) but not nearly as funny as it could have been. Not bad for a final outing since the events in Infitine Crisis really played havoc with these characters. Guess we will never get to hear another BWAHHAHAHAHAH in a comic again for some time. Sad.
3,Cool characters saddled with a weak sitcom sensibility,"The idea behind this graphic novel is appealing. Take some of the more obscure heroes of DC comics, put them together in a team, have them bicker with each other while stumbling through their adventures. It could've been great. Instead, it's just so-so.My biggest problem here is with the characters. They don't have personalities. With the exception of Mary Marvel (naive) and Guy Gardner (arrogant), no one else seems to have any character whatsoever. Instead, they spend most their time delivering Grade B sitcom lines that are not only not funny, but sound hollow and uninspired. When characters become mouthpieces for the writer's ""clever"" dialogue, I get bored very quickly.I guess I was disappointed because I actually like these heroes. They may not get the spotlight, but they deserve better treatment. Blue Beetle in particular gets underused, having absolutely no depth whatsoever.The art was cool though."
3,ok,It fits perfectly in my car but after continued use it has started to sag and doesn't block the sun as well anymore. Living in Texas these are a necessity
5,A MUST READ,"This book is many things - amazing, shocking, overwhelming and so much more. It was written with unflinching honesty and emotion and will give you an intimate view of the life of a police officer. We see them almost everyday of our lives and are often oblivious to the pain, emotional scars and demons they face on our behalf. This will open your eyes to their world and, hopefully, will help all who reads it appreciate them for all they do for us. They pay a very high price in their efforts to keep us safe."
1,Still Waiting,I've read all the great reviews of this book and it was a must buy for a stocking stuffer for Christmas.....It has yet to ship and I refuse to cancel my order!! Crossing my fingers it ships soon.
5,"Amazing, but not for the faint of heart",I found this book incredible. I'm at a loss for words. I read it in two days after work. He does an excellent job showing what officers have to go through during their career.
1,Bummer,I ordered this book over a year ago and never did receive it!!! I had an address change and it never came to me and no one would fix the problem. I never got the book or my money back...
1,Missed the nail!,"Just by looking at how only the author himself reviewed the book twice, should have told me to stay away, stay away! But, intrigued by Taoism in general and a graphic designer by trade, I decided to give it a chance. The meaningless rambling from the reviews continued on into the book, and on and on in a downward spiral. I thought it would get better once I got into it, but it ended up being a waste of a day of my life."
3,Who are thse guys? a post script,(...) I think this is a good read and I look foreward to reading more from Garant.
1,not good!!,"I received this carrier as a shower gift (and a baby bjorn as well). We're in the process of moving so I packeged up the Bjorn in the boxes and sent them to the new house (US-Belgium). BIG MISTAKE!!!! W/ this Eddie Bauer carrier, the tightening straps don't stay tight!! They slip down and I end up tying the ends in a knot behind my back. The head support comes too far down to support my baby's head and even now when he's comfortable holding his head up, I still have to support it myself w/ my hand. I haven't tried facing my baby out yet since he's only 8 weeks but I have noticed that the front does not stay down and pops back up. I really wish I had tried both of them on with the baby before shipping the Bjorn."
2,save your money,"This carrier was fine until my baby was about 12 pounds. The shoulder straps became so uncomfortable I could only wear it for a few minutes. The back support is just an extra piece of fabric... it did not support anything for me. Plus, once my baby could face out, the flap would not stay down! I bought the Baby Bjorn carrier and am much happier. Save your money and don't buy this product... put it towards something else!"
2,Not Recommended,"This carrier had some nice features, such as the great lower back support and padded straps. However, the adjustments on back/shoulder straps would not stay in place, regardless of the weight of our baby. We were constantly having to adjust the straps to bring the baby back up to a comfortable level. Also, once baby was able to be forward-facing, the front flap would not stay folded down out of baby's face. This is a rare case where ""more expensive"" does not equal a superior product."
1,New Mom in NY,"I gave this carrier only 1 star for 2 reasons. First, it's a hastle to put on and an even bigger hastle to get our baby into. There are 2 clips to strap the carrier to yourself and 4 to strap your baby into. Babies aren't the most patient people so be prepared! Second, my baby hated it. Every time we'd put him in it (no matter what mood he was in to begin with) he'd scream his little head off. We tried different adjustments - nothing seemed to work - except for taking him out of it.We haven't tried other carriers yet but we're still looking for the perfect one."
2,Not a good purchase,I thought that maybe I was the problem until I read the other reviews. This is way too complicated and cumbersome. There are so many straps and buckles that by the time I get it all situated and on me I've lost interest in using it. My son is 4 months old and it seems like he's soon going to be too large to fit comfortably in it anyway. I like the other Eddie Bauer products we've purchased but this carrier is horrible.
3,So-So,"I registered for this item b/c it was cheaper than the baby bjorn and looked just as sturdy - I have used it a few times when my little one was just born and I had to help support her while in it - support wasnt there. Now that she is 6mos old she likes it - but I can't help but feel she will be out of it soon and she isn't near the weight limit. There are a lot of straps, but once you get the set to where you need them its not too bad to get on and off - I use it by myself to take her for walks - she loves it. I haven't tried the baby bjorn, but for the next lil one I think I will look into that one. Overall, it works, I just can't help but feel it could be alittle easier to put on and off - less straps - and have a little more support for the child as well as your back."
2,A bit of a pain to use,"I registered for this one over the baby bjorn b/c it was cheaper and seemed just as good. I wish I had just registered for the bjorn it is way less confusing and is just a better product. It is very confusing to use, once you get the hang of it, it gets easier to get on and off, the staps are soo long and hang out all over, the part that folds down when the baby is front facing does not stay down and ends up in her face. I guess you get what you pay for, I wish I had read the reviews before I registered for it."
3,Description is a bit off,"At the time of writing this, the description forThe Velveteen Rabbit Gift Set: Hardcover book and plush packagehas Product Dimensions: 17.2 x 8.2 x 3.7 inches. So I figured the plush doll would be 17.2 inches tall from base to ear tip, about the size one would imagine it to be after reading the book, it's not, closer to 10 inches total. Besides that, it's a great book, one of my childhood favorites."
2,disappointed!,"I have no problem with Amazon, they only sell what is produced.However, over the years I have bought this item and given it to children so that they can enjoy the rabbit and be read to by their parents.Well, my great niece who will be 5 yrs old in April told her Grandmother, my sister, that her rabbit, was begining to fall apart and her Mommie was going to put him away and she was very sad. When my sister told me the story I told her I would see if I could find a replacement. I immediately went on Amazon.com and found the rabbit and book, and in fact I purchased 3, to have on hand for other children.My purchase arrived and I opened the box to find the 3 sets, and was very disappointed to find that the rabbit not only shrunk in size, but the quality also was not the same. My great niece will know the difference, other children will not, but I know and I am saddened to see this happen!"
3,Velveteen Rabbit book and animal,"I know the book and am completely happy with the book, but was disappointed at the small size of the stuffed rabbit that came with the book. It appeared to be larger in the advertised picture, and was in fact only about 6 inches tall - rather small for a young child."
4,very small! made for a nice gift still,"This set made a nice gift. Photo is deceiving, however; stuffed bunny is much smaller than you'd expect, and the book is smaller still."
3,cute but somewhat disappointing,"It came in a cute red gift box set, but the book is small....as is the plush toy. Great deal for the price. But the book is mostly without illustrations, geared towards an older audience probably."
5,The Velveteen Rabbit Gift Set,"I bought this for my little niece who is 3 years old. She liked the little stuffed rabbit. She also liked the illustrations in the book. She listened to some of the story being read, but I believe she will enjoy it more as she gets older. Her (my) nephews of which one is 2 and the other 4 loved both also. My sister has a 23 year old and a 3 year old daughter. This is a very good set, and priced nicely for any budget."
4,Great but short,I really love to read the felicity book's . But l wish they were longer and less expensive for kindle
4,Felicity's Surprise Was Good,"It was very finely written. I read it about 20 times now. I liked the other Felicity books better, though. -Jessi"
1,disappointment,I bought this video off ebay and regret it. There are a couple good crashes here and there but 90% are filler. ie: Vert skater bailing on a frontside air and sliding down on his kneepads...wth...save your money and time.
3,Very difficult!,"I've been doing yoga for years but found this workout extremely difficult.The instructor moves very fast(too fast) between moves and unless you're capable of balancing your entire weight on your arms you won't be able to fully complete or keep up. A much better workout is Brian Kest's Power Yoga series; very challenging, but great instruction."
2,Wrong Description,Listed capacitiy is 1/4 in to 1 1/8in. It actually is a minimum of 5/16in to 1 1/8 in. Same part number as other robinair's. This item has the wrong description and now i will have to return.
3,"Good movie, shame about the DVD!","I'm usually a Jet Li/Yuen Woo Ping fanatic, but I figured I could do with a change, so I got this to see some sword play, as opposed to my usual fill of straight up fisticuffs.The film was alright, but if you haven't seem them already, I'd suggest seeing 'The Swordsman 2' or 'New Dragon Gate Inn' before seeing this.My major gripe with this movie is with the format, this is basically another bog standard VHS->DVD conversion. The picture is grainy, the sound is so so, and the subtitles are white and imbedded in the picture, as opposed to being selectable. As is always the case with these types of subs, there are sections in the movie where they're unreadable!To sum up, if you've 'seen everything' and feel like a change, go ahead and give this movie a spin, but if you've already got/seen the VHS version or like your Hong-Kong action without the tongue-in-cheek, I'd give this one a miss."
2,sonnyreview,"If you gonna get good action movie titles from Brigitte Lin ,buy - Dragon Inn,The East is Red(SwordmanIII), Swordman II, The Bride With White Hair(skip the part 2) , The Dragon Chronicles The Maidens of Heavenly Mountains, Deadful Melody, and for Zu: The Warriors From Magic Mountains - I find myself falling asleep not because of the plot but of age. If there is a remake of this movie by Yuen Wo Ping as martial art director with Brigitte Lin is gonna be a hit(it is my wish)Anyway, With The Three Swordmen, you have to force yourself to watch to the end just to understand the plot. The martial art action is not so .......If you want my opinion, you can skip this one; unless you want it just to collect DVD."
2,Too Simple,"Zen in 10 is a very simplistic book. It gives a very light overview of what Zen is and it appears it's intended only as a primer. While it does give a brief history and philosophy of Zen, it seems its intent is to make sure it gives the reader Zen for aesthetic purposes rather than any serious discussion of this branch of Buddhism. I can't recommend any books on the subject since this was the first one I chose to read but I know that if you are serious about learning about Zen this is not the book."
4,Great book,This is the second book in the series and one of my favorites. It was an easy read and the two lead characters had great chemistry
3,"I wish I could give half stars, this would be 3 and a half","I really enjoyed this book for most of the way until the h became extremely annoying. I had been prepared to give this book 5 stars like the previous bookMuch Ado About Youuntil the h decided that the H didn't truly love her. Although I was happy with their hea, I felt that this unnecessary part of the book detracted from it. Overall the book was well worth reading as the author really writes well. The supporting characters add to the story and I adored the H."
2,What happened to the main character?,"After reading the first book, I expected Annabel to be much more bold and brash like Scarlett O'Hara. Instead, I get Melony. She just gives up her dreams and runs off with a penniless Scotsman. Her comic seductiveness has somehow disappeared between book one and book two. Ewan's character is kind of wimpy too. He's not a rake, just a rich spoiled lord. He is also religious, which is not a bad thing, but I tend to like reading about the bad boys not the choir boys. He definitely does not have the character strength that Annabel in the first book would have required.I'm only half-way through the book, and I don't think I can finish. The only thing that keeps me going is the interplay between the other characters.Now Imogene has the Scarlette touch, but she'll probably loose it in the third book. The author does not seem to be able to maintain a characters personality throughout a series of books."
1,Boring,"The movie was a desappointment, it is more like an slide show than a movie, no one talks, there is no story to follow, there are some shots of Ibiza but they could be more since there was no story, it is not even erotic, as far as I am concern it is a low budget soft porn that I was sorry I purchased."
3,Over the Top but Fun,"This is an over the top movie, so you have to expect the soundtrack to be the same way. It is fun though. It has all the songs from the movie, so you won't be disappointed if you like them."
5,It's a classic and it was brand new when it arrived! I'm happy!,Bought this item for my 4 year old niece after she watched Annie the movie and fell in love with it! The CD is now the only thing she wants to listen to in the car and often starts reciting the songs while shopping or playing in her room. It was a great purchase.
3,"Fun, but not the Broadway musical","I got this for my daughter who's getting into musicals, because it's the ultimate girls' musical. I had the Broadway show album as a kid, but that isn't available at all. That album is great, so I hope they'll reissue it. This movie soundtrack is like the movie: it's a way to get the gist of ""Annie"", but it's a bit disappointing."
4,enjoyed,my granddaughter is in love with this movie so i bought her the sound track..she listen's to it daily..it is straight from the movie and sounds great..i know as i have to listen to it quite a bit
5,We love Annie,We love it...my four year old daughter watches it 3 times a week! We also purchased the music CD. Great!
5,Great for little ones,"I am not a fan of little kids (under 5) sitting and watching a 2 hour movie. However, listening to soundtracks of musicals is a great thing for them. There is nothing cuter than hearing a toddler belt out ""When I fink of a day that's gray and wonely I just pick up my chin and grin and say..."" while you are driving. I love it! Plus, there seems to be a small window of opportunity for this since the kids become more inhibited as they get older."
4,Not as sharp as the Broadway version,"First of all, the score is brilliant. Charles Strouse is a mastermind of melodies (Bye Bye Birdie, another example...) and he caputred some of the 30s feel here. The people that are writing in with bad reviews are morons who heard Jay Z's sample of ""Hard-Knocked Life"" and for some stupid reason bought this soundtrack thinking it would be beats. Jay Z is probably one of the most talented rappers out there but maybe he's a bit too sophisticated for his dumb-ass audience.With the exception of ""Hard-Knocked Life"", the original Broadway musical is a better rendition. They added some songs for the movie which are relatively forgettable...I don't know if Strouse was involved in that."
5,Daughter's favorite,My daughter loves this CD and listens to it at least 5 times per day. Mailed quickly after purchase and in excellent condition.
5,Loved it since Birth,"I have been an Annie fan since my parents could remember, i probably came out singing ""Tomorrow"". The songs from this soundtrack are very singable for those who like to follow the music, and can be compared to the classical Grease and Sound Of Music. The music has a catchy tune, great lyrics, and the songs are transcendent of time. Everyone from little kids to the elderly can enjoy listening to this soundtrack and make their ensamble complete with a smile."
2,ICK - SAME THING I SAY ABOUT THE OVERBLOWN MOVIE,"This soundtrack pales, GREATLY pales, against both the 1999 Disney movie soundtrack and the 1977 Broadway cast. John Huston was the WRONG choice as director, Al Finney as Warbucks can barely sing and why did Houston & the producers dump such winning songs as ""NYC,"" ""We'd Like to Thank You, Herbert Hoover,"" ""You Won't Be an Orphan for Long"" ""Something Was Missing"" & ""Annie"", only to replace them with murch worse songs like ""Sign,"" ""Dumb Dog"" ""We Got Annie"" ""Sandy"" & ""Let's Go to the Movies""? UGH! Avoid buying this cd soundtrack & the movie video at all costs. Go out instead & buy the video to the 1999 Disney TV movie. A MUCH better choice..."
2,Disappointing sounndtrack from a disappointing movie.,"The movie version of ANNIE is one of the biggest stage to screen blunders to emerge from Hollywood. A great stage property was destroyed by producer Ray Stark and director John Huston. The ANNIE movie soundtrack should not be your first choice when purchasing an ANNIE recording. The original Broadway cast is the way to go. Even the latest recording from the ABC-DISNEY special is better. The movie version dropped some of the best songs included in the stage version (NYC,HOOVERVILLE, etc)and were horribly replaced (DUMB DOG, LETS GO TO THE MOVIES, etc). The awful musical scoring by Ralph Burns does nothing to evoke the 1930s setting(believe it or not,Burns was up for an Oscar for this work). The vocal performances are generally good, but Aileen Quinn tries to hard and tends to be unbelivable as Annie. Forget about the movie misfire and its soundtrack album, stick to the Broadway original."
2,Different Version than I was used to,This is the version with Carol Burnett and not Kathy Bates as Miss Hanegan so the songs sound different.
5,ANNIE REVIEW,"I grew up in an orphanage as a child. When I was adopted, my parents showed me this play. I have loved it ever since, Annie seemed real to me back then. When ever I was sad I'd listen to the Annie record I still have. I still listen to Annie songs over and over again. Annie changed my life, now I am an actress, and I love every moment of this life that Annie gave me. It is an exquisite play, everyone should see, young and old."
5,I LOVE ANNIE (1982),"I'll make this short and simple. I was 7 years old when Annie hit the big screen, it was instantly my favorite. I got the record, my grandma made me all the dresses from Annie dress patterns. I was in my own little Annie world for years and loved every moment. I always go back to the Annie songs from 1982, I've heard others, but in my opinion they don't even compare to the Annie that I first heard."
4,I am hearing Annie in my head,"My daughter (5 yrs old) is in love with this CD. She plays it nonstop. TAking a bath, going to sleep, getting dressed, etc..... I am starting to hear ""Tomorrow"" in my head."
5,The Guns of the South,Its an excellent book says my husband who I got it for. He likes books like this one so therefore that is why I got it.
3,An interesting story but certainly not alternative history,"The Guns of the South begins in 1864, Lee has just lost Gettysburg and the Southis reeling. However, he is approached by a man, from the future, who offers him a service. This man promises a fully automatic weapon unlike any the world has seen, the AK-47.This book is entertaining but it is by no means an alternative history. If you'd like an accurate alternative history book dealing with the Civil War I suggest a book called Gettysburg, the author's name illudes me however."
4,Neat Book,"I read this book while in eighth grade. My one friend who is a Civil War freak told me about it. At first, the idea of R. E. Lee holding an Ak-47 seemed really retarded. I did get the book, though. After five pages into it, I couldn't put it down. I recomend it to any Civil War Buff. The only thing that I didn't like was the politics. I found them boring as Hell! Other than that, Harry Turtldove knows how to make something that sounds totally stupid into a really cool story."
4,Guns of the South: good history and good reading,"The author takes a science fictional premise: what if the south would have access to modern weaponry during the civil war?, and applies an obvious understanding of the history and causes of the civil war. The result is a completely enjoyable book that offers insights into the life of soldiers, generals and presidents (yes there was more than one, Jefferson Davis had a northern counterpart called Lincoln something). The one thing that seems a little hokey is the use of Afrikaners as the bad guys, but Mr. Turtledove knows better than I and who can argue with this very talented author. My recommendation buy this book, read it and then buy as many of Turtledove's books as you can get your hands on, trust me you won't regret it"
3,"Great for what it is, but...","I really enjoyed this book when I read it back around 1995. However, I was disappointed that Turtledove, with all his historical expertise, couldn't find any better way for the South to win. The book starts out reading like a power fantasy, as the rebels suddenly find themselves able to overpower the Union troops who have been grinding them down. It does get better once the war is over, and Lee has to face the long-term consequences; but the premise still feels pretty gratuituous.Turtledove went on to redeem himself with How Few Remain and its sequels. How Few Remain starts out with a short scene describing a much more reasonable horseshoe nail (the North fails to find a dropped message carrying the South's battle plans), and moves on to explore the horror that would have ensued if the US had been divided. Trench warfare in Kentucky in 1881..."
1,The proof reading of the Kindle edition is abysmal,"I won't review the book itself, as it has been generously covered by others. But in reading the Kindle edition, I have to ask if they even bothered to proofread it.Obviously hardcopy pages were scanned and OCR'd but it is rife with errors: Proper names appearing incorrectly and/or inconsistently (""Gait House""?), what appear to be some dropped lines or partial lines, incorrect ""correction"" of deliberately misspelled words (e.g., Forrest's ""skeer"" turned to ""sheer""). And then there's the place where they appear to have scanned in the wrong page or two, replacing the text for half of one scene with duplicated passages from several scenes earlier. Just brainless error and no quality control.Should I quote my proofreading rates to the publisher? Apparently they don't have anyone in-house doing it.The rating is for the quality of the Kindle edition, not the book itself."
5,Sometimes the cause you support is not the cause you think.,"This was the first Harry Turtledove I read, like many other first reads at the suggestion of a friend. The story revolves around how South Africans discover time travel, and go back to the American Civil War to offer Lee a supply of AK47s. The South of course turns the tide of the war, and South Africa expects to have a new allie in their future world. And that is where the twist comes in that I will not give away. Turtledove is a master of Alternative Fiction. It says so right on his book blurbs, and I have found it to be true. One of his few stand alone novels with no sequels, I recommend this to anyone who would like to discover this writer without being pulled into a series."
3,Interesting Premise,"The second half of the book is interesting, as it begins to dive into the consequences of a Confederate victory during the Civil War.While I have not read much on the Civil War, this book served a dual purpose: that of a slight primer towards the motives and misconceptions towards the war, and an entertaining look at one more what-if in world history.People say the story is not bad if you can get past the time machine theory. But then again, why should one have to get past that? It's almost like asking a Confederate soldier to get past the unachievable notion of an automatic rifle. What will we be capable of in the 21st century??Good book, even for someone (like myself) that has not read much about the civil war."
4,Guns of the South ROCKS!,"I cut my teeth in the early Eighties with alternate history from the late Randall Garrett's Lord Darcy books. Ever since I picked up Harry Turtledove's alternate histories of the Civil War starting with this book right here, I'm hooked. I've got a BA in American History so for me, knowing the world we live in and it's past and being able to compare it to Harry's world is great fun. I've loaned my copy to other friends to get them hooked too! Thank you Harry for a world that could have been. When I pick up one of your books, I can't put it down till it's done."
5,Excellent Alternative History,This is an excellent example of alternative history. Being a dedicated student of the Confederacy it is nice to read such a book as this. Thanks Mr. Turtledove.
2,"If this is his ""best"" I won't be reading any more from him","I slogged to the end of this book, hoping for some nugget of goodness to redeem it. It never came.The most glaring problem, among many, is the fact that the South African villains are so cartoonishly evil. Other than delivering AK-47s, they serve only as a miraculous way to sway all the pro-slavery political leaders toward abolition. So the thing feels more like a fairly tale than a serious ""what if?"".Many have commended the opening chapters' battle scenes, but it's not as though the world needed a novel to explore what war would be like if massed infantry charged automatic weapons.There was obviously a lot of painstaking research done on various Civil War units and soldiers, but the silly plot and weak, weak characterizations detract too much."
1,"Great concept; starts off well, bogs down, spurt at the end.","Turtledove has to spell out every detail of his alternate world. When I say spell, I mean S P E L L it out. Did I mention he goes on and on and on...If you get this book, I recommend reading the first 100 pages, then skipping to the last 50 pages. Without spoiling anything, here's all you will miss:The bad guys are B A D, but some are worse than others.The good guys have to fight against prejudice and greed.The wheels of change turn S L O W L Y, especially in a Turtledove novel."
1,An unbelievable Premise,"I tried to like this book, I really did. But the ridiculous premise was just too much for me. Typically alternate histories follow a more or less believable plot. For instance what if Abraham Licoln had not been killed or what if america lost the Revolution. Somehow, ""what if neorascist South Africans brought hundreds of thousands of AK-47's back to 1864 in their time machine"" has got to be the stupidest idea ever. However, if you can hold your nose and get past this its not the worst book I've ever read. It attemts to depict life as a Confederate foot soldier in a realistic manner and the author obviously did his homework with the RE Lee character."
4,Alternate History,"I'm all up into this kind of thing (""Fatherland"", & etc.) ""The Guns of the South"", is sure enough an entertaining read, but kinda glosses over time-travel paradoxes. On the one hand, it seems the 1990s books, brought back to the 1860s, should have reflected the changes wrought by the time travelers. On the other, as the tomes had already been printed & extant when brought to the alternate past, one might assume the material contained therein was immutable (as opposed to the, ""Back to the Future"", or, ""Frequency"", theory, where an act undertaken in the past would cause printed text, images or even objects to alter before one's eyes. That's a lot to try getting one's head around, if considered too seriously, so my advice is to put all technicalities aside. You'll only drive yourself nuts trying to over-analyze all the nuts & bolts of time travel, so don't. Just enjoy the stories!"
4,Intriguing,"The interesting part of this novel is Turtledove's explanation of how the victorious South deals with their freedom and, more importantly, the question of slavery. Passages on the time-traveling South Africans are kept to a minimum, so hard sci-fi'ers may be disappointed here. This book is more for history buffs.Questions: Would Lee and the South have been as willing to change their slavery views had they not stumbled upon the trove of books that they did?Why weren't the South Africans more subtle -- thus, more influential -- in their attempts to control Southern politics? With the power at their disposal, what they resorted to seemed outright silly."
5,Genus,"A work of alterative history so good that it sould be use in history classes. Even with the sc-if elements, needed to change the fact and focus on stuggle of the south to find out what kind of a nation it wants to be."
4,Clever and entertaining,"Above all this book's authentic style highlights the fundamental greatness of some of the leaders of the period. With or without AK-47s, Robert E Lee was a man of integrity and firm convictions, and so was Lincoln. The introduction of the AK-47 into the 1860s changes the course of history, but human nature, good and bad, remains the same throughout a very interesting read."
4,Interesting View of the Confederacy After Victory,"From the onset, it's all too obvious that Confederates armed with automatic weapons will slaughter their Union opponents & win the war. The great interest in this book is it's story of what happened after the war: that Abraham Lincoln lived on as a discredited advocate of north/south friendship; that Lee became the Confederacy's progressive president; and that the South was, 1st, to defeat their S. African racist allie, and, 2nd, to learn and apply the 20th Century technology that the S. Africans had bought with them."
4,A Great Book . . .,"Very well written. Once again, Turtledove draws you into the action by allowing you to experience the big picture through his characters. I don't read as much fiction as I used to but Turtledove makes me want to spare the time . . ."
4,An excellent alternate history book,Anyone who wishes to write time travel fiction or alternate history should be required to read this book as part of their homework.Harry deals wonderfully with the problems of ethics that pop up when dealing with the paradoxes of time travel.
1,I should have known...,"I should have known what to expect when I saw a favorable review by James McPherson on the back cover. (Has anyone ever seen Harry Turtledove and James McPherson in a room together at the same time?) Whether it's ""Alternate"" history or the other kind, I would rather not have to view the past as a reflection in the fun-house mirror of 60's liberalism. I thought this book would be an interesting intellectual exercise but it is just politically correct silliness."
1,"Implausible story, and awful portrayal of people","This book has a very implausible development of the story. Furthermore, the character portrayal is very bad. Nathan Bedford Forrest is made into some monster, which he really wasn't. Also, Lee is not the Lee that we find in history. If you don't want anything to do with what really happened, then you might still be interested in it. But, then, why abuse actual people? Why not just make up your own whole world? I never liked time-machines anyway. Also, in the 1860s people had the technology to make AK-47s. They just didn't have the idea. Instead of making someone bring the machine-guns over with a time-machine, the author should have just made them make it at the Southern factories."
2,Man Beat Up By Book!,"I've been assaulted by a paperback! I could (and not just for my anti-confederate tendencies) relate to the plight of the Federal infantry pushing through the walls of lead on that Wilderness road. ""The Executioners Song"", is a great example of a novel that seeks to recreate events in a nearly minute to minute basis... Guns of the South, in spite of it's promising premise is not. Written like the old Cheech and Chong ""Summer Vacation"" skit, it attempts to wring extensive exposition out of everything. Leaving the reader no choice but to skim first paragraphs, then pages, and nearly entire chapters at a time- with no signifigant loss of overall comprehension. As tiring was the constant use of AK-47 throught the novel. Granted, there's no way to spell it out, but perhaps more use of the term ""repeater"" or some local slang added more character, and a greater sense of integration into the time period...PoZi (;="
4,Great Book.,This book was great. I was at scout camp when I read it and I had the whole troop sitting around listening to me (they liked it to). I dont really like the idea of the south winning.
4,Can't Beat The Price,I thought I was ordering the thermostat unit.....my mistake it was not.. The price is OK and unit works good. Easy to hook up and use.To do it again...... I think I would order the Procom unit (looks the same as the Kozy World unit) with the thermostat for around the same price.....
3,Great,It works good but goes through a lot of propane but heats up really fast and stays very warm just on low
2,six pack long way for men only,"I got this set hoping it would give me something different. The preview was motivating and inspiring. I felt having a personal trainer advise you is much better than some model showing you some of their routines they have learned. When I viewed the tape, I realized it is mostly geared for men and you need heavy weights or gym equipment to do them. Spending almost $100.00 for DVD and still needing to buy equipment, I was not interested. At least mention it at the beginning so the consumer won't be disappointed. I will give it to my husband I guess."
1,Not for a non Gym Member,"As I pop in the first disk I'm listening and getting hype to workout, but soon as I see the start of the workout I read bench press.. WHAT!!! I buy a dvd to do at home workouts not gym workouts. Don't recommend at all, unless you have a gym membership. I mean what else is the point of a dvd? To watch and do the exercises at home! Come on Man!"
2,I would buy it on the official site rather,"The disc does not come with the eating system ,and it kind of made me feel like I'm not getting what I paid for."
2,Not Marvin's Best,"Two songs are great on this CD (in my opinion, and I'm a huge Marvin Gaye fan!) - but this is my least favorite of all his recordings - and I own them all. However, I only play the two I like - which is worth to price to me :)"
3,The content is almost identical to the second edition,"It was with great enthusiasm that we ordered the 3rd edition of Professor's Webster big hit. With all my respects for Professor Webster, I was personally disapointed to observe that this edition has almost the same content as the second one. Maybe it is worth mentioning that I have adopted this text for my bioinstrumentation course from the very first edition. It is amazing that some of the very good and recent works done by Prof. Webster's team of engineers and students was not at all included. Even the references are almost the same as the second edition. As the second edition had really something to say compared to the first one, the natural expectation was to see a 3rd edition much more elaborated in terms of novelties in the field. The amount of new material put into this edition seems not to justify the publication of the 3rd edition."
3,Could be More Simple,"Explains dynamic characteristics of circuits very well. It has a ton of information - which can be too much. If you are just starting out in a course on instrumentation, I would recommend, ""Principles of Bioinstrumentation"" by Normann. His book is much simpler. Ideally, you should get both,..., it depends what level you are at (as a 4th year bioengineering student, I preferred the simple version...)"
3,"Coulda been bigger, but still loves it","I recently bought this cute orange hat for the cold weather we're starting to get, but its smaller then I thought and tight around my head as well. I have afro textured hair that's really bulky and chunky at times so I try to wear hats that are loose or somewhat big enough to fit my hair and head in the hat together comfortably. This hat fits my head just fine but its really tight around the back where it has the elastic strap. The strap squeezes my head a bit and makes it uncomforatble to wear the hat. I'm ordering a black one that has a size choice so hopefully its big enough to fit my head and hair. I love my orange hat but I'll have to wear it when my hair is straight or in a more flat hair style then what I usually wear. If anything else I wish that the company that made this hat could make it at different sizes for different types of head/hair sizes if possible."
3,"Gatorade works great, but quantity is skimpy for the price","While exercising in the hot southern California sun, it's vital to keep hydrated and to replace salt and other minerals lost while sweating. I bike ride for two to three hours on weekend days and drink quarts of Gatorade. Gatorade mix is the most economical way to do this. Previously, Costco sold big $12 jars of Gatorade mix that each made 6 gallons, but now I can't find that size anywhere. These small jars (each makes two gallons) look a lot bigger online than their real-life 4"" height. Counting shipping, each costs about $11. Not worth it; I'll keep looking."
5,Thisis a great read!!!,"I was fortunate to have read ""In the Lord's Library"" quite some time ago and thoroughly enjoyed the entire book. I feel that MARSDEN did a superb job in creating this storyline and was able to put into writing a very believable tale. It is evident that MARSDEN spent a portion of his career as a police officer and he has been able to bring to life some of the situations which he faced while in service.If you are looking for a great story to read during these rainy winter months, look no further than ""In the Lord's Library""Enjoy!"
5,What an awesome book!,"You can certainly tell the author of this book is a veteran police officer. The places he takes you, and skillfully I might add, could only be achieved by a cop who has been there, done that, and yes, even took the pictures for his file. While there was certainly a lot in this book for me, I can easily say there lays within these pages a little something for everyone, as well as the lesson that we can all be as strong as the main character Judith. We just have to allow our free will and inner strength to take us there. The author skillfully weaves this believable story by leaving you hanging at the end of each chapter, challenging the reader to abandon the pages but I would have none of that. I kept right on reading!"
4,Too Big but ok,"I got this for an upcoming trip to Disney since the heat is acting up the 2 water bottles come in handy. Only drawback I see is that it is too big, you can't get a feeling from the pictures of how big it actually is but aside from that it is exactly what I needed. Lot's of room and pocket and it can be adjusted in a lot of different ways to match our size."
1,This is gardening with Allen Armitage Hosta CD ROM,I was diapointed with the CD.There was to much show and not enough coverage of the Hostas. I feel I wasted my money. I can go to the Hosta Library on line and see a greater selection of Hosta. Also you can print pictures from the Hosta library. I wish I didnt buy this CD.
3,Not that much useful information,I was recommended this book for reading and did not find it that useful. If you are thinking of starting your own company most of the information is stuff that you have read through magazines or on the web.
4,"Great bag, larger than expected though","Pros:-Relatively lightweight-Warm (fine sleeping in a t-shirt and boxers at 38 degrees w/ 20mph winds in a hammock)-Both bag and compressions sack seems well stitched-Roomy compared to some of the other compressible mummy bags (I'm 6ft, 205lb, average build, and it's pretty comfortable)-Pillow pouch makes anything into a pillow (can even make plastic water bottles feel comfortable as a pillow)Cons:-Zipper sticks unless you pull up carefully-Bulkier..but manageable (compresses to about the size of a basketball)Overall/Comparison:Perfect three season bag for the average back-country camper/hiker/bushcraft enthusiast."
2,Not as warm as advertised,"I recently went camping on a night when the temperature hit about 39 degrees and I froze my butt off in this thing even while wearing long underwear. It's simply not as warm as the manufacturer claims. Other than that, it works fine, but that's a big ""other."""
4,The best one so far,"Easily the best volume of the three Avengers Essentials to date, we now see Rascally Roy Thomas at the scripting helm, along with Awesome John Buscema doing most of the art chores. Say no more! This duo is one of the greatest in comics lore... and even demi-gods Barry [Windsor] Smith and Gene Colan show up to help out on art.This collection contains the spectacular introduction of the Vision, the Avengers vs. the (old) X-Men, several battles with arch-foe Ultron, and the classic Avengers vs. Avengers thanks to the machinations of the time-spanning Scarlet Centurion. I'd give this compilation five stars, but the several issues featuring Hercules and the battles in god-ville are just plain dull. (Avengers #50 featured this crap? YEESH.) But don't let these few pages spoil the rest of the great fun."
3,less than just Black + White,"Yes they're super cheap, yes you get a ton of issues, and with the right volume a ton of classics. But all of these Essentials were originally drawn by the artist with a mind towards color. And these aren't just color comics muted to shades of gray. No. All color is removed. A bright yellow explosion: white. A dark blue, almost black background: white. One of the originals books I own, Avengers #61, is rendered unreadable by this process. Essential? Hardly. But I'll look at the glass as half full; I've just bought the worlds best coloring book."
3,"Good cover, but not much of a case.","While this cover will provide a cosmetic cover to virtually everything but the slider ""button"" and screen, expecting it to protect your Zen Vision in case of a drop seems very far-fetched. Utilizing the arm band is a joke. I felt like the silicone was going to tear at any time."
2,Better than nothing,"As this was the only case I could find for the 60gb Zen, there wasn't much choice: have one or don't. Since I am in a war-torn, third-world country, I didn't have much to choose from. The armband is too small. To use it I almost cut off circulation to my arm. I, by no means, have big guns, but in trying to make it fit around my arm, tore the stiching at the loop. (Fortunately I know how to operate a needle and thread.) The slits in the cover are placed too close together. If you aren't moving your arms it is fine, but when I am doing any type of activity (like cardio), it bounces all over my arm. I would have to say that it is better than nothing, but only marginally. More research should have gone into this product."
5,Simply one of the best Comedians!!!,"This is a hilarious cd every track on this album is good and hilariously funny it was done in the 1980's and is still one of the best Comedy albums today I would recommend anyone who likes Eddie Murphy to buy this album because this is a very good album and I really enjoy it I laugh so hard that I end up crying this is vintage ""Eddie"" when he very first came out and he was wonderful with his comedy so buy this album you will be glad that you did!!!"
2,Early Eddie,"Murphy was getting hot on ""Saturday Night Live"" when this was released, but you won't be able to tell it from this first album. Includes the unfunny single release of ""Boogie In Your Butt""."
5,Great for acne!!!!,"I don't have a big acne problem but I used to get one or two a month in the same areas. And they were not small. at least until I started using Really Really Clean. I will say that I started using it (the whole anti aging line from Amino Genesis)when I was doing a test trial for an infomercial. The company itself didn't pay us or give us more product for a year like they said they would and the infomercial wasn't made, but I'm now buying my own Really Really Clean cleanser because when I went back to another face cleanser, the acne was back. I recommended it to my 15 year old neice who was having a really bad acne problem. She had tried Pro-active and that other thing that's out there now too. neither worked. Really Really Clean has cleared her skin up tremendously. she looks so much better. I don't know about the anti-aging aspect (I think that's why they didn't pay us because it didn't make us look younger)But it will keep your skin clean and bright."
4,Surprise Inside,"This product does what it intend to do. I love it, however, I gave a 4 rating because you do not know just how much is in the container and before you know it - its gone without warning. So, therefore I felt cheated regarding the quantity of the amount inside this wonderful cleanser, but the QUALITY is excellent. And, yes, I would definitely purchase it again while hoping that the manufacturer would consider a full dose."
2,HORRIBLE TRANSLATION AND DVD MESSED UP!,"When I bought the first and second season I was expecting them to be good....NOT! This dvd season is messed up and the translation is HORRIBLE! The dvds are really messed up and keep skipping and messing up. Don't make the same mistake I did by having this product. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY! Please learn from my mistake. This is a very good series, but the person sold me a joke. HA HA you jerk! Joke's over, I want my money back!"
5,Just as good as the first season,"This season picks up where the first left off, but as the first left us on a good note, this season is a bit sad at first. Makino hasnt spoken with Domyoji in about a year since he went to new york. The F4 do there magic and try to help Makino meet with Domyoji, with the help of Rui.But to her surprise he his a whole different person and Makino goes back home dissapointed. Not long after Domyoji returns with another suprise this time from his cold hearted mother...hes engaged.Broken hearted Makino tries to tough it out and becomes friends with Domyojis soon to be wife. Plus having to deal with her first love Rui who now has feelings for her. This season has lots of twist and turns and never gets boring. The bonus is you see more into the rest of the F4 boys lives as well."
4,Hard Disco,"Pat Thrall, guitarist supreme, unrecognized as are too many excellent musicians. However, this album is a separation from Thrall's original work with Automatic Man, a cutting edge psychedelic soul rock band from the early 1970s which produced only 2 albums. This album is more reflective of the 70s disco trend in that it has a dance appeal but with some of the artistry of Pat Thrall on guitar to enhance what would otherwise be mundane."
2,Only one great song,"I can't understand why this album get such high ratings. To me, the only really good song is the opening ""I got your number"", but that one is very good. The rest is a strange blend of pop and rock that doesn't work at all. The material is also very time typical. I would not advise you to buy this album if you're looking for steamy rock tunes in the Deep Purple manner."
4,Unique Rock sound from Trapeze/Deep Purple/Pat Travers,"Great Bass work from Glen Hughes, One of the all-time best. Pat Thrall, who worked with Pat Travers on his best albums, excels at his guitar performance. One of the best you've never heard of. The vocals are crisp and original. A great addition to your collection!"
4,"Edgy, hard, funky and slick","Glenn Hughes (former Deep Purple bass player and back-up vocalist) and Pat Thrall (former guitarist with the Pat Travers Band) join forces for an edgy, hard, funky and slick cd. Thrall's clean riffs and Hughes' strong (Rick James does hard rock) vocals really work here. This is a really great cd (for those of you who like that 80's rock sound) that very few listeners have ever heard about. Get it and crank it up!"
5,One of the all time classics.,"This may not be one of the most well known albums of it's time ,but it's one of those masterpeices that kind of fell through the cracks of the busy music business.If you like good rock and roll, or if you're more eclectic of taste, this one will get your attention, and I'll wager that you'll never trade your copy in."
3,"Good build quality, but...needs one modification","Good quality, but missing one small hole, which holds the flash. When you lock the flash, small pin goes to the hole, which is missing.Nikon and Canon both needs this."
2,You Get What You Pay For,"It won't last long, but it works fine when it does. Heavier flashes will pull the contacts out of the mount. Spend a few extra bucks for the Nikon."
4,Beautiful English Cottages,"The English Cottage Interiors book is a great resource guide for gorgeous country living. The pictures are perfect for my art work. When you can't be there, it's the next best thing to being there. A book you'll enjoy looking at time after time again."
2,"Misleading title, lackluster book.!","I was expecting a book with pictures of english decorating style. This is certainly NOT THAT. It is on the small side, so if you're looking for nice photos, forget it. It just wasn't what the title led one to expect it would be. Dissappointing!"
3,Some nice photos and a lot of highbrow hot air.,"As a big Wong Kar-Wai fan, I had to have the book. But most of the ""critical analysis"" goes way too far in trying to ""understand"" his films. He must get a great laugh when he reads about these author's claims of knowing the deeper meaning he was going for. Check out the pictures and forget about the articles."
5,Amazing book!,"This was one of my favorites when I was a kid and it is a shame it is out of print since I wanted to get a copy for my niece.There was another book, also an older childrens book (I am mid-late forties and I read it when I was ten or twelve), about some kids living in NYC and going on Saturday adventures that couldn't cost more than 10 cents each. It was a girl and her brother and an immigrant boy...does anyone else remember this book?"
5,Great Reference Book,"My boys love this book, great way to know where to get what in the different games."
5,Totaly awsome!,"I haven't gotten this game guide yet, but I saw it in borders and fell in love with it! Don't look for lame excuses for free guides on the internet! There aren't any! I've looked everywhere. One thing though, You can get Jirachi from Pokemon Channel but it doesn't say in here! don't be a trainer without this!"
5,Ronson Review,This is an excellent reference for Ronson made items. I really enjoy using it as I collect or try to collect many of the items in the book.
5,stretching!,Great stretch - good to relax to. I use this in the morning to get the kinks out. You'll like it too.
4,stretchin' to the classics,"Fine for pre-walk, but not used as often as other, more heart-pumping videos for exercise."
5,The best book I've read this year!,"Indeed it is the best book I've read this year and I read a lot. I was given the book as a birthday gift by a friend and I thank her for her wonderful taste. I've read it on a flight to Brussels and I could not put it down. The emotions the author expressed throughtout the book kept me captivated. It is difficult to choose few of the short intertwined stories (they'are all of high interest), but if I have to pick only two I will opt for the one on ""first love"" and the other on ""Dick"" the author's dog. Well, I cannot say enough for this exceptional story, the sentiments of a little girl towards war and its results is a cry for PEACE and BROTHERHOOD, the ruined dreams and lost childhood innocence, touch deeply the heart. I loved it! I wish there were many books like this. Beutifully narrated, eloquently expressed! Congratulations to the author and many thanks Anne for making my birthday and travel so pleasant!!!"
3,Promise of book unfulfilled,"I wanted to love this book but I couldn't. The author is obviously intelligent, well educated, and a perfectly fine writer (technically speaking), but for me, she lacks the ability to convey the full depth of wisdom and understanding that these rich experiences must have imprinted on her. The book is a series of short stories that, while interesting, did not truly touch my heart. Given the great breadth and depth of material Ms. Psyhogeos had to work with, I feel she could have done much better."
2,I found 1 that I would watch again,This multi DVD purchase had virtually no topless activity and the plots were boring and slow moving--I will now check out the movies in a value pack
3,Drive-in Cult Classics Vol3 Review,"Hardly Classics. Out of 8 Movies, only 2 were worth watching The Babysitter, and Weekend with the Babysitter. Both have the same theme. Lolita-type Babysitter seduces the Father. Or who Seduces whom? The rest of the movies in this collection are forgettable. Of the two Babysitter movies, Weekend with the Babysitter is considered the best. But it is difficult finding them both anywhere. Video quality was good."
2,Drive-In Cult Classics 3,"The sale, the delivery and the process where no problem. But the movies are not ""Cult Classics"". A few young stars doing movies ok, beyond the quality of the movie (because of the years this was done, and I expected that) I was not satisfied with the movies. Don't get me wrong, the movies were OK, but not cult classics.Thank you."
1,An infuriating disaster.,"This atrocity deserves no star, but Amazon requires at least one star from reviewers. The production values in this film, as well as the plot and the characterizations are appallingly poor. The audio engineering is so inept that one must have remote in hand to adjust volume from scene to scene, and even within scenes. The level of wit is childish and will appeal to all with a taste for bathroom humor. Direction and acting are on the level of a rural high school class play. The central figures, two young ladies besotted with a Japanese boy wonder concert pianist, appear to be in their late teens, but behave like prepubescent ninnies. Was hoping at least to see an interesting performance from Maury Chaykin, but alas. How can this be the same Maury that has since developed a superbly engaging Nero Wolf?..."
1,Not worth buying,This is the worse possible rabbit hutch to buy. Ours began to fall apart not even after a year. Called the Ware company and they would not do anything
2,Meh,"These guys aren't bad, but they lack the sublime, seething energy of the true rock n' rollers (Buddy Holly, Hasil Adkins, Johnny Burnette, etc) which the Cramps seem to have captured. Like most of the Britpunk of their era, the Meteors tactlessly yell out all their lyrics, in effect ignoring the American folk/blues tradition of vocal experimentation, and translating all the effort they put into their music into a constant boring drone. The Stray Cats do the same thing, so youmight not want to waste much money on them either. So, I don't really care if the Meteors want to call themselves the first psychobilly band. The Cramps were the ones who actually nailed the rockabily sound."
2,Don't settle for less than the best,"I'm a psychobilly and rockabilly fan, and the meteors are a very popular psychobilly band. I find them hard to listen to because the singers voice is not inviting and pleasing to the ear. The instrumentals are good, but if you want something really fun to listen to that you won't get sick of, don't settle for this. There's much better psychobilly out there."
3,Consummate dancer poor recording quality,"One of the finest male ballet dancers in the world, Baryshnikov, has generally been ill served by poor definition video recordings. This particular DVD of Twyla Tharp choreography does not really show his great virtuosity, and too little has been released in this medium."
4,The dream 2,"Here in Brazil we could not find this DVD anymore. We looked for it a lot. It was my young friend dream to watch his idol and ""mentor"" to dance. Now my 16 years old Brazilian dancer is happy and doing his job of studying dance -a hard task for a boy, isn't it? - better than ever!!THANKS!!!Vera"
3,On the down side,"The problem I personally have with this presentation is artistic: the choreography seems to lack overall structure and form. Instead of building a dance from, say, simple to complex or simple-complex-simple, the choreographer throws in complexity at the beginning, then tends to alternate helter-skelter throughout. The result is a lack of building toward a clear climax or clearly shaping the work for so long numbers.There's nothing wrong with the dancers, though; they're all great. Perhaps I'm influenced by the great film dance sequences of Astaire, Kelly and O'Connor. Their choreographers (often much added by the dancers themselves) knew how to structure a number.As for Baryshnikov himself, he's one of a kind, utterly magnificent, as are the member sof the American Ballet Theater.(No rating rendered here.)"
4,Felicity Merriman is nine years old and lives in Virginia.,"This book is great! Valerie Tripp tells the story so well that I think she really is real! Felicity isn't a prissy lady like girl, she's a tomboy, which was really un-lady like in those days! She is definatly my favorite American Girl!"
5,Gospel music at its best,This is one of our favorite CDs. We couldn't enjoy this CD more.All of the tracks are wonderful. We're glad we were able to findit on Amazon. Hope the Gatlins continue to produce such great musicfor years to come.
3,"Good Angle mount, but not a gate to be opened & closed frequently","Good gate, easily installed, does a great job for hard-to-gate angled corners. The only problem is that the base of the mount easily pops out of the mounting when you open the gate. It's easy enough to pop back in, but it does get annoying. It would be A LOT worse if we had this gate mounted in a spot that we had to walk through frequently......"
2,Looks a lot better in the picture.,This visor is not as attractive as it looks in the picture. But it is very light and folds up to a really small size so I will keep it in my purse just in case I get caught in the rain.
4,Game Changing,"I used to have a lot of fear/trouble approaching women and having them be attracted to me. I might be able to make them laugh but I couldn't make things go any further. I was seriously lacking this department. This series helped me communicate confidently and generated interest and attraction in women. I was able to go on more dates and eventually found the girl of my dreams and have been happily married for 3 years now. This series is definitely worth it if you have trouble in the ladies department. Also, David Deangelo's stuff is helpful in just building confidence in general and overcoming fears and obstacles in your life."
3,Billy evolves...,"Though this album is packed with beautiful and excellent songs, like ""Pressure"", ""Goodnight Saigon"", and ""Allentown"", Billy shows all too obvious signs of evolution, especially on songs like ""She's Right On Time"". And the sad thing is, he'll never go back. The bettersongs can be found from his earlier years, like on ""52nd Street"" and on live albums like ""Songs in the Attic"".52nd Street: A- Songs in the Attic: B+ Nylon Curtain: B-"
3,"Surely not up there with his best, but a great Billy fix","My fave Joel albums are Piano Man, 52nd Street, and Glass Houses, but the first five tracks on this one are a great 80's fix - I bought this remastered cd and LOVED the ""Pressure"" video - haven't seen it in YEARS!!! The rest of the tracks are not up to his usual standards, but this cd is definitely worth having."
3,preatty good cd,"While there were some songs on this cd that were great to listen to, I found that unlike Billy Joel's other cds, there just was not enough, and I was a little disappointed. There are not enough songs that are worth listening to(compared to other Billy Joel songs). After stating all of this, I still have to say that all in all, I am glad I bought this cd."
4,one of his most underrated albums,"i listen to songs for the lyrics...i like the music, but the best songs are those whose lyrics say alot...billy joel is one of the premier songwriters of the 20th century.he's not a poet like dylan, but he knows how write lines that are memorable and is very adroit at working a cliche..."" pressure "" sounds like a theme for the manically depressed. it's one of tracks i've heard the most on here...""laura "" is about an obsessive compulsive relationship...the narrator knows he shouldn't come running to her aid, but he does it anyway...""scandinavian skies"" is sweet and timeless. but the best track is "" goodnight saigon."" i love the introduction, with solo piano and then the roar of the helicopters. the songs builds and builds until it explodes into an orchestral sonic boom.."
4,An Occasional Need,I've owned this album in one form or another for several years. Months or years will go by and I won't listen to it and then all of a sudden I will not want to listen to anything else. A good album if you're feeling moody.
3,"Good, but...","This is a good effort by Billy Joel, I love so much of his music. My favorite is the hard rock, in-your-face ""Pressure"". ""Allentown"" is another good song, and very true to life.But honestly, Mr. Joel, I could have done without ""Looking like a f---ing fool"" in ""Laura"". I didn't expect to hear that and didn't like it. Other than that, not a bad recording."
2,2.5 Stars- Billy finally starts to go downhill,"Basically, when you get past ""Allentown"" and ""Pressure"" this is a pretty weak offering. I know I'm not going to get very many helpful votes, but I have to write an honest negative review once in a while. I do get a kick out of watching the video ""Pressure"" because I think it works better as an MTV video. Just getting the visual makes it twice as entertaining. ""Allentown"" did kind of have to grow on me. I wasn't impressed when I first heard it, but now after all these years, I kind of like it now. But after those two it's a pretty crummy album if I do say so myself. I just think the creative well finally went dry for Billy on NYLON CURTAIN. Let's just face the facts, Billy just made super albums in the 70's, and this ain't the 70's. Buy anything from the 70's and you'll be overjoyed."
3,Political Writings?,"Admittedly, it is difficult to define what exactly constitutes Milton's political writings, as he wrote on such diverse topics as divorce, freedom of speech, and how to establish a free commonwealth. Oddly, however, none of these works are in the book that I am here reviewing. Only the ""Defense of the English People"" and ""the Tenure of Kings and Magistrates,"" found their way into this edition of Milton's political writings. Despite the injudicious selection of political prose coming from the people at Cambridge University Press, the introduction by Martin Dzelzainis is particularly helpful in terms of situating the texts in their historical and ideological context. Also, the texts themselves are well footnoted to give the reader a more nuanced understanding of these two sophisticated landmarks of English republican political thought."
1,Ok I give up .....,"This book will win a prize as being absolutely the worst Black Lace novel ever put to paper. My goodness, and I have read and finished some pretty lousy books in my time .... I could not get past page 61 of this book ... not unless you tied me downBasically the book deals with Toni, a female private eye that specializes in finding lost teenage girls ... she certainly has a dominant edge and absolutely loves to torture and degrade the men she couples with. Yup the word is 'couples' since the pleasure of sex is definitely secondary to our heroine .... She has to be 'hands down' the most displeasing main character I have ever met ...I have given high ratings to other books I hated since they weren't really written for my tastes, but, this book has no redeeming values ..... pass it up ...."
2,filter gets hot,The filter came quickly and was a good price. However the filter gets hot after vacuuming for a short time. I had also replaced the other filters in the vacuum so it's not that they were plugged and restricting air flow.
2,Not as good as could be,"I hoped, after reading other reviews, that this would be the perfect wireless headphones. Unfortunately, when used as wireless, the sound quality is seriously diminished. The wireless receiver is connected to the mp3 player by a short (less than 2 inches) cord. When the cord is moved, touched, bumped, etc., the headphones fill with static. So if you keep your mp3 player in your pocket, your normal movements will cause static. As corded headphones, these are a good product, but you could get other products much cheaper. But as wireless? I'm still looking."

3,"OK Book, not as good as Chicken Soup for the Soul","I bought this book at the Volunteering conference and read it on my way home. It is OK, it met expectations but did not exceed them. I think that Chicken Soup for the Soul is better, but this is good."
4,"Not not this one, but all the books in the series!","These books are perfect for any young girl (6-10). The girls in all the books are brave, loyal, kind, helpful, and many more quailities you might want your daughter to posess. And they have enough adventure to keep any girl interested. Read them all, get a doll, and discover the world of American girl."
4,Nat - urally,"These are great shades. They have a classy yet modern design, are comfortable to wear, are lightweight, and the optics a crystal clear. For casual outdoor activities and just plain looking good, you can't do much better than the Fossil Essentials - Nat."
4,A Great Memoir,"I had to track down my copy of this book from a rare book dealer. I was part of TF 4-64 Armor during the run-up to combat operations. I shared a tent with Dave Pearson, Paul Vitigliano, and Terry Ward, amongst others. I went to school with Todd Mayer, Bob Roth and others who were in this battalion. I stuck around in the Army, and am an old Colonel now, and still run into members of the Tuskers from time to time. Yesterday I saw Bruce Griggs. I liked Dave's book. It is record of events that I turn to to keep my memories from getting too faded. If you want to know what the Gulf War was like at the battalion level, read this book. If you want to know what it was like at the platoon level, read ""Eyes of Orion"". I'm proud of having been a Tusker, even if it was for a relatively short period of time. I got GEN Craddock to dedicate my copy. If you were in the Tuskers, I'm sure he'd do the same for you."
5,Best Book I ever read,"WOW. I served with the 4-64 Anvil Company. I was with Fiorillo's boys. We were the Wrench. This book brought back alot of memories even ones that I had forgotten that were not mentioned. Thank you. I will cherish this book and pass it to my children. I have lost contact with everyone. I would love to get in touch with anyone who was there with Anvil. Even you Fiorillo, dispite the conflicts we had on board the M113. We had some good memories. Victory to all of the 4-64. .. God Bless and thank you Mr. Pierson.SPC Leal 63E10Wrench 1 (Driver)"
1,"Terrible wriiten and illustrated, not written for students!","This book is definetely not an intro to a seriously heavy topic, the bookis wordy, the diagrams are all poorly drwn in plain black and white. And believe me when it comes to tracing pathways up to the brain a little color coding would help. Even the most simple concept is ultra wordy and is basically there to show how verbose Mr. Webster is. Im an Audiology doctoral student with a Speech Path and Psych background and this book will confuse the fudge out of anybody(and did)but neuroscience undergrads and neuroscientist.Do not buy,read other sources like Barr's The Human Nervous System or if you have to just share a copy and make copies this book sucks!!"
1,Cheap and not worth the money!,This book is confusing and cheap. Buy another book to supplement! The organization of this book was difficult for me to follow. Good luck to anyone who's professor uses the textbook. It could just be my learning style but I struggled to learn from this text book and my professor who required the book.

5,Great first book! Started fast and kept it up throughout.,"For a book to begin by grabbing you in the first few pages and then keep up that pace, gotta be some writer. I will be watching for more books from this author"
3,That's it????,"That's what you'll say after veiwing this video. First off, lets face it, you bought this DVD for the T&A, not to learn about what your favorite diva does for fun or why she is afraid of the dark. And that is one thing this DVD lacks, T&A. There is very limited actual photo shoot footage, just interviews. Rent it, buy it used or just skip it, your not missing much."
3,Mostly a tease,"In the spirit of every other WWF Divas item(website, videos, PPVs, breakfast ceral, beach towel, suppositories), WWF Divas in Hedonism is a lot of T&A tease, only worth buying if you're a die-hard fan(why?) of the WWF divas. Essentially a making-of video, it takes you through the shooting of the latest WWF Divas magazine and website photos. Numerous bikini shots are separated by short in-ring clips and some behind the scenes clips.If you absolutely, positively cannot live without a video of Trish, Lita, or Terri in skimpy swimsuits, go ahead and buy this, bot otherwise, rent it, or buy the magazine, which condeses the video down to just the best shots, and without the diva's voices(a plus, from where my ears are sitting)"
1,Not really a hot steamy video,No this is not a good video like many have said there is just too much talking in this video it is not a really entertaining video at all at the end I was like That's it? I am not being a pervert either it is just that the cover looked rather appealing of these WWF chicks and I was expecting some really nice footage of these women but instead I got alot of tease and pure boredom. I mean come on here like many have said we have all seen hot chicks in bathing suits before I mean I can get this kind of footage free on the E! wild on show? Bottom line some really nice footage of these women here and there but nothing to really scream about the talking and subjects that these women were talking about were just boring and I felt like this was not worth it.
2,Too much talk,"Entirely too much flapping of the gums and not enough substance. Postcard from the Caribbean is much better, and that's says a lot about how utterly boring Hedonism is. Rent it, get it from a friend but skip on the purchase."
1,Too much talk.,"To keep this short, to much talk- not enough action!!!I can hear them speak for free every week on T.V. I will admit that it does have its moments, however I do expect alot more!This item is marketed for guys. So why didn't the WWF give guys enough of what we want to see?"
4,Lots of bonus material,"There are 9 bonus clips on the DVD. Some of them are behind the scenes of photo shoots and wrestling matches.The women get to talk out of the WWF characters, so you can get to know a little about them.The quality of the captured video is clear and bright.Some downsides to the video: 1. There is no Stephanie McMahon in a bikini. I would like to see Stephanie McMahon in a swimsuits segment. Although, she is in one of the bonus wrestling clips. 2. Each diva segment is too short."
5,THE BEST IS YET TO COME,The WWF just open their a new section on their Diva site about this photo shoot. I know the DVD will be out of this world for sure. The magasine was incredible and the carribean video with the Divas was awsome. I expect an incredible collector item once more from the king of sport entertainement !
1,Bought in April of 2008 and fell apart in less than 2 years,I paid $799 from target in April 2008 and it's May 2010 and the cushions fall apart in our hands. Did not last long for the price. Frame has 7 year warranty but nothing for the cushions.
1,hope ur handy,the set is nice looking and surprisingly sturdy but when it came 3 of the legs were broken off 3/4 of them were bent( and to try to bend them back and it just broke them off). I went to homedepot and bought some square wooden dowels and cut them to size and placed them inside the hollow legs to make them sturdy. it will due this season but next year I will bye a better set.I think you should pay more and get a set that will last ( or one you won't have to jimmy rigg.....
4,"NOT AS DESCRIBED, BUT ACCEPTABLE.","NOT AS DESCRIBED. IT IS A NI-MH BATTERY. IT IS UP TO YOU TO DECIDE IF THIS IS BETTER THAN A LEAD-ACID ONE FOR YOUR USE. THIS IS NOT A LI-ION BATTERY. I WAS REALLY DISAPPOINTED WHEN I LOOKED CLOSER AND FOUND THAT IT WAS NOT A LI-ION. NI-MH ARE NOT REAL GOOD IN COLD WEATHER.Lighter in weight than my lead acid ones. It charges fast.....BUT.....not to be recharged when half discharged unless you have an ""intelligent"" charger that tapers the charge as it nears full. The original Panasonic charger just socks the charge to it. This didn't hurt the lead acid, original batteries. IT GETS THIS ONE HOT....REALLY HOT, IF IT IS OVERCHARGED.Anyway...this fits my AG-456UP video camera perfectly. The one complaint with the company is that they add $4.99 for each battery shipping. Several will fit in a Priority Mail Flat Rate box....and the shipping for up to 6 of these should only be about $11."
1,Tree books are the exact same,Illustrated Guide to Building Period Furniture and Building 18th Century American Furniture and Fine Furniture for a Lifetime (Popular Woodworking) are the same book. I bought the tree at the same time not knowing that.This is a racket.
5,Great new way of writing How-to Books,"Great book, I've not made anything from it, but I like the new way that they are printing these How-To books. Lots of pictures 4-5 per page with assembly instructions explaining the pictures. It makes it easier than 2-3 pages of instructions, and you guessing how it all goes together."
5,How Culture Impacts Psychological Processes,"Overall, an informative glimspse of the fairly short history, and important aspects of cognitive anthropology. This work starts out detailing the initial concepts which helped form, what is today, a growing branch of anthropology. Dr. D'Andrade's format for DCA makes its contents and important concepts extremely organized and accessible, respectively. Although many may initially consider this topic dry, when Dr. D'Andrade delves into schema theories, cultural models and psychological and cognitive processes the reader's interest is sure to heighten. This is in part due to the manner in which the information can immediately be applied to an analysis of one's self. Though this is certainly not a text whose value may be truly appreciated with a quick one-time-over, there is a wealth of fascinating, well-structured and exampled information available for those willing to invest some thought."
4,Don't put it through water,Mom 8 year-old son was in awe with this toy. He LOVED it! The pictures show it going through water though. Note...DO NOT LET IT GO THROUGH WATER. He was heartbroken when it broke from running it through water. The water got into the housing and mechanics and wrecked it. It was fun while it lasted though.
5,Chasing Villa - a First Person Perspective,"Great book written ""from the saddle"" by one of the US Army's last cavalry leaders. My grandfather served in the expeditionary force and I have for years tried to learn more about the campaign. This book, I think, completes my collection of authoritative works about it with Col. Tomkins' personal experiences. Frank Tompkins' insight is invaluable if one is attempting to understand this peculiar piece of US military history. The setting is so foriegn to our current 21st century lives it is almost hard to imagine - even through western movies. And yet, it is perhaps, an unintentional cautionary tale about poorly thought out ""expeditionary warfare"" told in the first person. Mexico in 1916 could easily be substituted for Afghanistan in 2001 and the search for Villa in the midst of a civil war proved just as futile as the search for Bin Laden - for at least a decade."
2,Boring! Couldn't finish it!,I couldn't finish this book. I kept putting it down. The book moved too slowly.
3,"the good, the bad and the slightly irrelevant","The intial parts of the book which focus on the diamond trade in collapsed west african states was fascinating and a breeze to read due to it's succinct writing style. However , I was disappointed that the end of the book seems to lose focus and clearly strays from the book's very title. The last few chapters regard not Al Qaida and diamond smuggling, but fund raising for militant Palestinian groups from within the US using various scams in Brooklyn and elsewhere.I feel that defining Hamas as threat to the United States is highly inaccurate and also unbalanced with out al least a mention of Jewish diamond merchants and their support of militant, armed settlers.Overall, a good read but, disappointing in the end with references to people like Steven Emerson, which takes away a bit of the credibility of an otherwise interesting work."
3,You could figure these things out,The book is alright. It's not that creative in terms of giving you better ideas on what you can make. BUT it does tell you how to make different size corking tubes with things you have laying around at home.
2,Needed more Projects,"If you already have a spool knitter and lots of ""snakes"" on hand you will be disappointed. There are not a lot of projects, especially for the smaller snakes. Too much of the book is devoted to making spool knitters."
3,CORKING FUN,It's a short book but with good ideas - good as a reference book for ideas but not too easy to follow - if used with kids Mom or Dad will need to explain what they mean in the directions.
4,Great Projects,"The projects in this book are fun and creative, and the instructions are easy to follow. The only thing I didn't like about the book is that it had all drawings instead of photographs, and the drawings seemed very childlike. They were the kind of drawings you would expect to see in a toddlers storybook."
1,Stop beating around the Bush!!!....,"Burn him!!! It's not 'wisdom' it's 'with doom'. Not even smarter than his father (who was so limited he could not go downstairs and chew gum at the same time) since he could not even think of a new war to enhance his (so-called) presidency, only to resume the one started by his father. And why, when there is no interesting alternative, there seems to be no way of getting rid of both candidates and starting afresh."
1,THE WORST THING I'VE EVER SEEN,I can't believe I spent my hard-earned money on this thing. It is literally a prank. Believe the reviews. It is 30 minutes of hell. Worthless. It's a shame because there is so much content to pull from to have made this a revealing and humorous DVD. Any distributor or retailer (including this one) of this travesty should be just as ashamed as the creators for RIPPING PEOPLE OFF.
1,Universally OFFENSIVE!,"As I watched this I grew angrier with every passing moment. Whether you are pro-Bush, anti-, or nuetral, this DVD is an insult to your intelligence.Some butt-heads with poor video-editing software simply patched together a string of Bush hesitations, overdubbed five phony questions using their schmaltzy fake ""reporter voices"" and looped the entire thing over and over for 20 minutes. Since any of us could do the exact same thing with ANY video of ANY public figure, it makes no statement about Bush at all. It only tells me that the makers of this piece of carp (Melee Home Entertainment) deserve to be at the bottom of the entertainment barrel."
1,Save your money and time,This must be a Karl Rove ploy to separate money from those who laugh (albeit with sadness) at the President's mishaps with the English language. This is as bad as the other reviewers have stated. The same few seconds of Bush reactions repeated for 20 minutes as responses to very lame fake questions. A scale of 1 - 5 stars does not allow a truly representative rating. I am thankful I only wasted a couple of dollars on EBay. Amazon site says more on the way. Return to sender.
1,Waste of $5...,"Same clips of W over and over again... The only thing more painful than the editing in this film is the first several minutes listening to his daughters attempt to be funny... If you want to waste your money on this DVD, I will sell you mine...otherwise it is destined to be a coaster."
1,"TERRIBLE, I WANT MY MONEY BACK",This was the most rediculous film ever made. Don't waste a penny on this awful film. Your pennies will be better off in a donation jar at a fast food joint. There is absolutley no plot what so ever.. it's just a long clip of nobody saying anything actually. DO NOT GET THIS MOVIE
5,A hilarious look at 20-something singledom,"This book is so much fun! I loved the author's humor. Her view of life as a twenty-something is hilarious! I literally laughed out loud. Isn't that the best?The characters are great too. I found myself so involved in their stories, I didn't want to put the book down. It's a great weekend read. Don't miss this one!"
3,the case fit well but..,the case fit well and its hard enought to protect the psp from any scratch or fall; but it doesn't have so much space for the games and the charger.
2,Very tight fit...,"The psp fits in the bottom part of the case, but it's a very tight fit. Some pushing is required to place the psp and once in the case, the shoulder buttons remain compressed.The upper portion of the case is roomy enough for extra umds and memory sticks but I'd be willing to sacrifice most of that storage space for a tiny bit more psp wiggle room."
1,Not Right Size,"this PSP Super Travel Case with pockets, is not the right size. my PSP 3000 barely fits in it. it is a little too snug for my liking. when i put the PSP in the case it puts a lot of unneeded pressure on the L and R buttons. overall its ok, does protect it, but is not the right size, i would recommend getting a bigger one rather than have to always worry if the L and R buttons are going to break. i know i do."
4,Great Travel Case,"I just read the last review here, and that person must be a MEATHEAD! They say (don't buy, PSP won't fit). B.S. I have a PSP3000 and it fits just fine. I also have 9 UMD disk inside, 8 in the case and 1 in the PSP itself. Also when I close it, I dont have any button smashing problem either. So the system and a bunch of UMD's are portable with this case. I also read about you need a piece of cloth to cover a rivot to prevent scratches on back of PSP system. This problem has also been solved, there is small velcro patch to cover the rivot. There's also 2 spots to store memory sticks. Overall i am very happy with this product, and would say it is a good buy."
4,"Travel case, just a problem","Very nice travel case, just one single problem. When you open the case for the first time to store your PSP you will notice that, in the upper right corner, there is a small piece of metal that threatens to scratch your device."
3,Good for PSP but doesn't close with more than two UMD,"I bought this and so far it works perfectly.Just a little detail: If you are planning to carry more than 2 UMD the case might smash the buttons on top.So, good to protect your PSP but not as a UMD carrier.My advice if have several UMD to carry on: keep looking around."
4,Great case,"I really like this case; my PSP fits snugly, and there's a ton of room for extra games. This case gets kicked around in my backpack fairly often, and it's holding up great. Only issue is that metal rivet others have mentioned, but I just put a cleaning cloth between it and the PSP."
2,LARGE CASE,"Bigger than expected. I thought this would be a slim case that would not hold a PSP 1000, so it would slip into my netbook bag easier. Not so, the case is a hard shell and very deep. I think I could fit 2 PSP 1000's in it."
1,So I guess they still haven't fixed this...,"So I made sure to read through all of these reviews, especially the most recent, before purchasing the item. I was under the impression that they had fixed the metal protrusion on the interior of the case. They have not. They also have not increased the space inside of the case to accommodate the shoulder buttons as some other reviewers have indicated. I'm not sure whether this is an item that you either get ""lucky"" with or screwed, depending on which version of the product you receive, but it's not worth the gamble. I shouldn't have to modify any product I receive from any manufacturer for it to function as intended."
4,A decent PSP Case.,"I purchased this PSP case for my PSP-3000 that I purchased on Black Friday. I was a little apprehensive, seeing the mixed reviews on the site, however, I went ahead and bought it. Fortunately, I didn't encounter too many issues with this product.The case I received allowed sufficient room for the PSP, so it wasn't a tight fit as I may have believed. However, the metal ""rivet"" is present on my case, as expressed by other reviews on this product. A quick cover up fixed that problem, and that was the only issue present in my purchase. However, I understand some ""versions"" of this case feature the metal rivet covered up, so perhaps it's a mixed bag.Regardless, I feel this product, for it's low price, and good functionality, is a great buy. I don't regret purchasing this product, and feel it does its job well."
1,Terrible case,"My brand new PSP 3000 didn't even fit in this case. I had to bend it and try and stretch it out just for it to kinda fit in there. The top flap's Velcro doesn't work very well. Because the psp doesn't fit very well there leaves very little room for games on the top. Probably a stretch to fit two umd games/movies (the say four). I purchased a silicone sleeve for my PSP as well (have not yet received) and there is NO way it i will fit in this case. I did not expect it to be this small. If you want a cheap case that barely gets the job done, I guess get this one, but there are MUCH better cases out there for just a few dollars more. Oh, and a lot of reviews talk about a metal button coming through the case. Mine came with fabric over the button, just like someone posted a picture of, so this was no problem for me."
4,PSP on the fly,"Nice sturdy case, your PSP fits snug, has a belt attachment on the back with two sleeve like pockets inside that can hold 2 UMD's in each, plus the inside front cover has a small net across it allowing you to carry even more stuff.As mentioned in other reviews the rivet that the caribiner is attached to is exposed and will make contact with your PSP, I used a small piece of ""SHAM WOW"" (cloth)to cover it but anything will do. Don't let that stop you from your purchase this is a great case for the $$. If I needed another I would get the same one."
4,Pretty Good,"This is a pretty nice case for the price.Pros: No branding, well made, rubber coating on outside and 2 belt options.Cons: Rivet makes contact with PSP and moves when clip does. Tight fit for a PSP 3000. Only 2 UMDs and PSP can fit in case.Overall it's not bad. I would give it 3.5 stars. Just wish it was a tiny bit bigger and the rivet had some fabric over it."
4,"Great case, but you have to be careful with it.","The case is very functional. It has slots for two UMDs making it possible to carry 3. Also has a pocket for headphones, etc...As others have stated, there is an issue with a metal piece from the biner where you store your psp. Where it is located (top right corner of case), it cannot possibly scratch your screen. I can see how it could scratch your psp though. I have been very careful with it because of what I have read in other reviews. I just lay my cleaning cloth between it and the psp, and that seems to take care of any problems. For the price, I would still recommend this product. Just be careful when you are storing your psp."
3,Decent for price / prime FS,"Decent quality product for what I wanted it to do (keep my PSP safe and cozy for trips / periods of non-use). I have to agree with other reviewers in that it has a major flaw. The little metal piece that sits in the same compartment where you would presumably put the PSP. It's the other side of the connector to the clip. I'm never going to use the clip, so I took it off. I then had to use pliers to rip the metal off, leaving a small insignificant hole in the case. I doesn't look TOO bad after doing that, but I'm more about function over form, so it doesn't hardly bother me. All in all, for what I needed it to do, it works well at it's price-point. The little metal piece is kind of a terrible oversight by the product's manufacturers."
5,My boys love it,My boys like how it has the pockets so they can carry games in the case with their psp's. They said they are very happy with it
1,PSP travel case,"Item as described, pockets allow games to slide around and if caught just right the games will bind on each other and they break, so games dont last long in it."
4,good product,"Good product, tight fit for the PSP3000 but gets the job done. Nice amount of room for games or usb cord. Not enough room for power cord. The clip is very nice."
4,PSP 3000 does not fit in the case,"I buy this item last week and I see not all its true about it, the only issue I found is PSP 3000 does not fit in the case."
3,Why no belt clip?,"I find it strange that no designer thought of placing a simple belt clip on the case for a system that is supposed to be ""portable"". It's a no-brainer."
4,Does the job.,"This is not a hard case. Meaning, if I drop something heavy on it, I don't think my psp will survive. However, so far no dust or dirt gets into it when I throw it into my workbag, so for that I give it a five."
4,travel case,"I bought this for my husband for Christmas he likes it, except we had to put a soft cushion cloth inside where the device sits because there is a huge brad or rivet in the corner which would wear on the game console."
5,Great Case,"This case kicks butt and it holds everything very nicelyVery nice material and I have dropped it a couple of times but it holds up good.You can easily fit the psp, 2 games and a usb charger"
1,PSP VITA super travel case,This was a disappointing purchase. The case is very small and you really have to cram it in to get the case to close. I liked the pictures and the fact that it had lots of pockets inside and a hook on the out side to clip it on my backpack but when it arrived I was disappointed. Now I have to keep looking for a good case that provides protection and storage for my VITA. DO NOT PURCHASE this case. Its way too small and kids will never get the device in the case and get it to close.
1,Ugh! This is a defective product!,"Our PSVITA does not fit in this case. Honestly, what is the point in making a product that doesn't even serve the purpose it claims to meet?"
2,REVIEW,"THE APPEARENCE IS GOOD, I DONT USE THE PRODUCT BECAUSE THE PSP Logitech PlayGear Pocket - Slim, IS BETTER IN MY OPPINION, I TRY USE IT WITH PSP AND POCKET SLIM BUT THE SPACE IS ONLY TO PSP."
4,...............,This is a good case for its price. It also can hold up to 6 umds although it looks like just for 4 :D. I think its a better choice than the other travel cases i have seen so far on Amazon :D.
2,Good case but too small and a little cheap,"The quality is good considering how low the price is, it has a good zipper and rugged padding. There is a little metal clasp in the case that scratches the PSP though. It is not big enough to hold the charging cable and that is a deal killer for me, I want everything i need in one small case."
5,Solid Case for IPod and Amp,"Perfect for my 160g classic and Fiio E7 amp. It does have the internal rivet mentioned by others, but I used some Pelican pick and pluck foam to cushion the electronics anyway, so this isn't an issue for me. It certainly wasn't intended, but the little loop on the outside is perfect for looping your headphone cable to prevent unexpected snags that might damage the jacks on your electronics.Can't beat the price to protect your personal audio. I'm sure it works great for a psp too, but I don't have one, so can't speak to this.Recommend."
5,Great thing to have,My son absolutely loves this game case. I searched everywhere for something like this during the holiday season and was unsuccessful in finding one. The time frame in which receiving my products were timely and efficient. Thank you Amazon
4,PSP,Great product. My daughters love it and play with it nonstop. I would encourage the purchase of a case and a memory stick when you buy the game. It's not so clear that you need the memory stick.
2,PSP vita,Does not fit the PS VITA. This should be written outright in the product description. Now I have to deal with return.
4,"For real traveling, sure.","The hard rubber case is a bit bulky, but that means it's sturdy. This is reasonable to use as a Travel Case (as it's called), something you're more likely to shove in your backpack or luggage. There's a corner loop for latches that's fairly awkward to use, but other than that this case is great.But if you're looking for a casual on-the-go case to shove your psp into the very pockets of your clothes, Get one of those soft pouches."
4,PSP Super Travel Case With Pockets,"A nice, light sturdy case. Pockets for 2 UMDs and room for cables. One minus--there is a rivet heaf in the PSP pocket. I easily fixed this by putting a piece of spongy shelf lining in the bottom. This is thin and solved, what I considered, a problem. All in all I am pleased with the case."
4,comment,The PSP travel case with pocket that we bought was just a great idea to keep the PSP console protected. It was shipped quickly and the description matches the product. Thank you.
3,S'ok,The case was what I expected for the cost. The carabiner that came with it broke instantly. That didn't bother me because the case still served it's purpose.
1,Scatch my brand new PSP,"I bought this item and the inside metal part of the case scratch the casing of my brand new PSP. Really frustrated with this cheap case.Buy the official PSP case for 14.99 at target, looks nicer and not cheap."
2,PSP-3000 doesn't fit.,The case is a bit too small for my PSP to fit in the holder section. It has to rest on top of it and while I can still close the case with the PSP inside but I don't have room for UMDs.
5,The Best Case,This travel case with pockets is a must have for your PSP.It is roomy in order to carry extra items and the divider keeps everything organized and it won't get scratched.
5,Road Trip Must,I got yhis for my kids and I have to say this thing is grat hold games and keeps everything safe inside.
4,cool little toy!!,i found that if you remove the landing gear it makes for much better flying. after awhile the battery fits sloppy in the airplane and you have to modify the opening a little with a toothpick. over all it is great fun even for experienced flyers!!
1,Too light for outdoor flying,"Extreme lightweight is not a plus outdoors. My son and I tried this out when there was only the slightest breeze, but this was stll too much for the plane. It often became unstable especially when not headed straight into the wind. After a couple short flights it nosedived and crashed, breaking the wing. Note that this item is sold through a 3rd party seller that does not accept returns once a product has been used.On the plus side it is easy to use and replacement parts are available."
2,Is this a putting competition?,"Watchin this video definitely will make you understand the importance of the putting in golf. But the OPEN is not just putting.Overall, this video contains too much talking by the commentator. The portion of players' action should be more, and much more than the portion they had in the video. And alos there way too many putting segments than full swings and other swings.Very disappointed by the content."
3,"Begins well, but becomes very complex","Java is an incredibly popular, albeit arguably difficult language. Many of us in the 'technical trades' may want to learn Java because of its cross-platform or built-in graphics capabilities, but may be put off by many of the Java books intended for computer scientists or web developers. This book begins well, but by chapter 4 is becoming all too complex. I would have liked to have seen far more 'hand-holding' explanation in the middle chapters, and more information couched in terms that may be more familiar to established engineers and scientists, e.g. more examples showing the similarities and differences between Java and older languages such as Fortran, Basic and Pascal."
5,"A ""Must Have"" For Gross Anatomy Lecture & Lab","THIS BOOK WILL HELP IMPROVE YOUR ANATOMY KNOWLEDGE & LAB SKILLS!! I highly recommend this book for any student (medical, dental, physical therapy, physician assistant, other) who is taking a gross anatomy class involving cadaver dissection. It has photographs sequencing dissection. Photographs are categorized by body part/region. This is very helpful when preparing & reviewing for lab dissection & exams. I recommend you use it with Netter's or Sobotta's (especially Sobotta's CD-ROM) Atlas of Human Anatomy (colored illustrations, not photographs)for additional illustrations & references. I believe you will find this book to be very useful. I certainly did!"
2,Design Flaw,"So, maybe I'm being unrealistic, but I think that a $100 kettle ought to last more than 2 years.Without any abuse (e.g., never boiled dry), the 4 tiny spot welds that bond the entire whistle/forward handle/cover assembly to the kettle body gave up the ghost. So now just a gaping hole where the harmonica used to be.Oh well. They say you get what you pay for, but evidently that's only if you're lucky."
1,"Beautiful, but silent","I received my beautiful Chantal kettle for the holidays in 2007. It was used TWICE and produced it's unique tone. After that, it went silent. Give me a break... TWO uses until it needed servicing. For a hundred bucks, you'd expect a bit better quality. Sorry, but this is CLEARLY not worth the extra expense."
4,Tuneful teapot,My wife and I really like this teapot. We have a stainless steel kitchen so it blends perfectly. We especially like its style and its two-tone harmonic whistle.The reason we gave it 4 stars was its size (3 1/4 quart). We were looking for something a little smaller. This is a minor complaint. It really is a wonderful kettle and we love it.
1,Please save your money,"I bought this item to keep my headphone cord from getting tangled, but this little slip of plastic wasn't up to the task. What was I thinking?"
5,Great book for kids!,"My 8-year-old son loves the animal ark books, and this was one of his favorites. The purchase overall was a success!"
4,This Book I Read A Lnot !,"I just love this book is called ""Changes For Felicity"", andI just love the American Girls Collection of all of them likeJosefina, Addy, Molly, Kit, Samatha, Kirsten, and of couse,Felicity, I hope you enjoy them, as much as I do.Enjoy!"
3,Lady's Tool Set,It's pink and comes with mostly everything you need. Would've been nice if it came with a level. The phillips screwdriver has a little nub on the tip which makes it very difficult use with most screws. Everything else works fine.
1,Not for serious users,"This is pretty but almost usless. Tools are a good fit for smaller hands, but cheap and shoddy~ break with normal use. Good for hanging pictures, but not for ""real"" use. Why can't they make something like this in good quality? The demand is out there. I bought mine to keep hubby's and kids' hands off (that part worked, sort of)."
2,Didn't Fit,"I had an Ash Dump in my fireplace that was old and needed replacement. On the existing Ash Dump unit was printed Hutch C459. I assumed given that name and number I would get an exact replacement. Unfortunately the size of the new one is larger than the old one and it didn't fit. The company was going to take it back but given the postage both ways, it was simpler to just throw it out."
5,Very nice photo study.,"This book, along with other GA books, is a great photo study of the works of one of architectures significant architects. In this case two of Richard Meiers earlier residential works. There are a few pages of text, in English and Japanese, describing the houses but the book is mostly full page photos of the houses. Most of the photos are black and white, what color photos there are they a excellent. At the end of the book are plans and elevations of the houses to help describe the houses in more detail. If you have an interest in architecture, particularly that of Richard Meier, this would be a good book to have."
3,too cute by half,"""Can't we all just get along?"" Not much here beyond that. Reasonably short, can refer to this work when our ""Conservative"" friends get a little too trite with criticisms of Progressive thought"
2,This movie [stinks],"The plot is weak, the script is horrible and bad directing. A big disappointment for a HK film and the film has no originality especially when they incorporated the dodging bullet scenes from the Matrix which spoils the homage of Hong Kong Cinema. Apart from that, they even incorporated a scene from Spider-Man O_o. It happens when E-kin fell off the trailer and he then shoots some kind of string from his wrist to keep him from falling. I can't really explain it though, so sorry.Don't waste money on this DVD, rent it if you like....I seriously recommend Jet Li's Kiss of the Dragon. It really kicks ... and Jet Li really make bad guys cry....hehehehehe! Or catch Spider-Man : the movie when it is release on DVD......the movie is a big success and they did a very good job! Can't wait for the sequel!"
5,A Great Movie,"This movie sort of contain the funny side of Ekin Cheng. Ekin character (King) is a big flirt. Louis (Jack) character is a person who is looking for one perfect girl (If there really is such a girl). Kristy play (Queen) as Ekin's younger sister. This is wierd because most of the movie I watch, they have always been a couple. Kristy have a huge crush on Louis, but Louis already have a girlfriend, which eventually they will broke up. What's so wierd about this movie? I think that the girl (Eleven) who play with Ekin is really ugly. I don't know how he fall for her in the first place. Eventually Louis fall in love with Kristy. I like the ending, sort of."
5,noddy review,it was just what i had been looking for for my grandaughter. she loves to watch noddy on pbs tv . it came in good shape and it was very fast shipping also.and might i say a very reasonable price. i will be buy from amazon .com again . i was well pleased with what i ordered thanks so much . james smith
1,The shipping took incredibly long,I ordered this product 2 whole months ago and STILL have not received it. I will be canceling.
3,Too expensive,"$20 for this piece of rubber is pretty outrageous.The interior of the handles has a spring that is glued by cheap glue, mine already fell off.Overall, this is a good jump rope for $10-15"
2,"Good rope for about two months, then it breaks","Ok, so I've been using this jump rope for about 2 years now and I've gone through four of them. The weighted handles are perfect for post workout toning and fat burning. This is the rope to buy to get shredded...HOWEVER, if you are serious, IT WILL BREAK. I understand if this was catered to a different audience how it might break so easily but it is a weighted jump rope. One assumes that people buying weighted jump ropes are serious about their jump roping abilities. Sadly this product is not made with durability in mind. I jump rope very fast, four days a week and one of these would last me about three months. That's pathetic, considering it's rather high price tag. In short, do not buy this if you are serious, but buy it if you are just starting out."
3,"Not bad, not great","The weights in the handles made a noticeable difference in the effort it took to keep the momentum going. Initially I could only perform 1/2 of what I do before my shoulders or forearms were burnt out. At 5' 11 the rope was not too short, but perfect. The only draw back was that the rope itself broke on me after week 3. The hard, black plastic on the outside snapped in the center and revealed the cloth string. No biggy I just used electrical tape and it was has been fine ever since(5+weeks)."
5,Great Jump Rope,"I haven't had the time to use this much yet, but it has been great so far. I did not see any of the problems listed by other users. The added weight definitely helps"
1,Title Misleading,This product information is misleading because it comes across as a history of why nations made Israel a scapegoat and why their is anti-Semitism. The information should include that from the beginning of this DVD and througout it is about the history of people in the New Testament.
3,I may get shot for this review,"On first listening of ""Sewertime Blues"" and ""Don't Touch the Bang Bang Fruit"", I listened with my jaw dropped to the floor. This is truly a brilliant band with an amazing guitarist. Nobody could possibly find a flaw in the debut ""In Heaven"". This being the third Meteors CD I bought, I am just kind of disappointed. A lot of the songs are bland and tend to sound the same. There are a few songs that stand out, but this isn't an album I reccommend to someone new to the Meteors. I would go with one of the two mentioned earlier."
5,Amazing,"These songs will stick in your head and never go away. It's the most bizarre mix of music I've ever heard, and it still works. Opera, swing, metal, mariachi... The songs are very catchy and are layered enough to be consistency interesting.This is metal you can dance to AND head bang at the same time.If you ever get the chance, see them live. The CD just doesn't capture the energy of their live shows, and this CD rocks. Plus the chaps are real nice as well."
5,"Very, very interesting music - a must hear.","-This CD you will either love or hate... no middle ground here. YOu have to hear it at least once... but give it a few listens b/c this kinda needs to grow on you... it's one of those kinda of CD's.-My first impression was that this was a complete joke... no, no, no. These are serious musicians/songwriters.-The production is excellent!-Imagine drinking an aural smoothie made of of Nightwish, Mephiskapheles, Faith No More, Mr. Bungle, Yes, and Sonata Arctica with classical sprinkles on top.-Cleverly crafted songs blend a very wide range of musical styles... somehow they pull this off well (no rap or country though, boo hoo)-There is NEVER a dull or boring moment on this CD... no filler... at all. All the songs flow from one to another.... This CD is almost too short.-Innovative Scandanavian music at it's best."
1,OUT DATED MATERIAL,This book is now out dated. The Xbox 360 supplied an update on NOVEMBER 19th 2008. The menus are completely different and the Setup has changed. If you buy this book understand there will be a NOTICEABLE DIFFERENCE between what the book describes and what you will actually be seeing.
4,Great book,"I love this book -- everything is well explained. It also explains the concepts in an easy to understand style for parents who are not too game savvy.Only problem though is that the book is too US centric -- the Xbox 360 is sold all over the world with slightly different specifications, and this book just ignores everything except the US Xbox 360."
4,Sleazy Fun,"This is your standard Warner Brothers Pre-Code - gangsters, cops, reporters, fallen women - you name it, this film's got it. Lee Tracy and Ann Dvorak were ideal players for this type of movie. They reteamed for Love Is A Racket, another Warners gem. Molly doesn't make much sense but it's a lot of fun."
4,cute costume,This costume is really cute and reasonable quality for the money. My only complaint would be the straps of the boots to be fixed over the shoes are way too long.
3,aluminum chair,"This chair is very comfortable, and the fact that it is aluminum, hopefully it won't rust so fast. The only problem is that it is a bit heavy to carry around. We have another aluminum camp chair, and it is much lighter."
3,Okay,"This book is about a 15 year-old girl who dies. Although there are humorous parts, it also makes you think. It could completely change your thinking about the after-life. The ending was dissapointing and rushed, but a good book anyway."
2,It had potential...,"This book has an interesting premise - after dying a person reverse-ages until they are born again - but ultimately, something fell very flat. Perhaps it was the writing style: third person present tense seemed somehow alienating in this case - making it more of a story told, than a story experienced. And another part of its ultimately disappointing nature was that there were soo many opportunities for more fun with the premise than actually happened. The idea of ""speaking Canine"" was a nice twist, but another example of a greater potential than its execution. Though it was entertaining enough, it left me unsatisfied by the book's conclusion."
3,Captivating,"Lizie is a victim of a hit and run and wakes up bald on a boat, not knowing where she is and how she got there. She gradually realizes that she is dead and that she along with her mates on the boat, are headed to 'elsewhere' on a one way trip.At first I thought I was going to get into another ""Lovely Bones"" (one of my favs) but I realized that altho both books cover similar themes, they were different and if I wanted to give this book a chance, I shouldn't compare it to TLB.The writing is simply yet captivating, and the storline is very much intruging. It's the kind of book you'd find yourself reading in one sitting. An enjoyable read."
3,inconsistently applied,"The premise of this book is that when we die, we go to Elsewhere where we age backwards until we reach babyhood, at which point we are returned to Earth to live another life. It's an interesting idea that is unfortunately applied inconsistently here, to the detriment of the story. In some cases, the aging backward is portrayed as being only physical level, with emotional maturity at least staying constant, if not increasing as the years go on. As the main characters return to young childhood, though, they are portrayed as both looking and acting their ""age."" This discrepancy wouldn't have bothered me so much except that relative age becomes an issue in the relationships between some of the characters."
5,Waking Up Dead,"Liz Hall wakes up dead one morning. That's definitely not the way to start off the day.At first, she thinks it's all a dream, but then she remembers being hit by a car. The realization sets in that she'll never fall in love, never get her driver's license, and never see her family again. She spends her days on the observation deck where passengers can peek into the lives of their loved ones still alive. It takes Liz's dead grandmother to show Liz that death is worth living and that it's possible to have all the things she thought she'd lost even if she's going to have to live her life backwards.A great young adult and older story about living life (or death) to the fullest."
2,"Great Concept, Poor Execution","I began reading this book with high hopes because of the back cover. However, the more I began to read, the more ANNOYING the way it was written got to me. There were many many times when I wanted to rewrite the parts for the author for the sake of the book's moment. I have never even thought that a book might not be worth the money but this one certainly was not worth my money. I think I just might return it. It's in well enough condition seeing as how little it took me to read it. I loved the dogs, though. Aldous Ghent was also quite hilarious. I give this book two starts, though because I do believe it had some good moments. Overall, I give it a huge PUHLEASE and I WISH I LIKED YOU MORE."
3,Not a fan,"This book has gotten quite a few good reviews, which is why I picked it up. But I don't get it! It's a very predictable story with predictable characters. Pretty corny, if you ask me.The only part I actually got a kick out of was the insight into how our animals really feel about us. Gave it a 3 only because the writing is well done, but the story left me cold."
4,"Flawed, yet fascinating","I won't lie-this book kept me glued to my seat until I had read every single word. The land of Elsewhere drew me in and wouldn't let go.This book has a very unique idea which sounds gimmicky, but definitely isn't. Somehow, the fantasy seems realistic.However, the writing (though engaging) does not challenge you or keep you guessing. It is fairly simple. This might be better than challenging writing, because the idea is so complex that complex writing might be overwhelming. But the simple writing gets worse towards the end and there are no cliffhangers. It takes no chances.Also, you can't really identify with the main character very much. Liz reflects what many of us would do in her situation, but she is not likable and you can't feel very sorry for her.Even though the writing is a little flawed and characters needed to be worked on, this book is able to rise above that. Elsewhere is definitely recommended for those who are tired of the pathetic teen novels."
3,Interesting...,"...but overall, it was pretty boring and didn't describe a whole lot of the situations. I'd have liked it if it were more clear on some topics and if it had more action."
5,"Haven't read whole thing, already have suggestion","I put five stars because I haven't finished the book yet, but my suggestion is that the book should be self-thought. thats all."
4,Great concept; Makes you think,I really enjoyed reading this book. You really feel for the 15 year old main character. It is a great concept for heaven to think about.
2,Tries too hard- and falls short,"While Elsewhere has grand ambitions, it falls short on the execution. Mrs. Zevin seems unsure of where she wants her book to lead, and the plot meanders through job-seeking, romance, and some completely irrelevent pursuits before its very satisfying end (the book is almost worth it, if only for the last 20 pages or so). In the middle, however, the reader must suffer through the annoying dialouge (reminiscent of grandparents and ever so predictable)and a frustrating, omniprescent narrator who likes to switch tenses and/or talk to readers as if they were 4-year-olds. In the same way, the talking dogs and other ilogical parts are a turnoff.Also, as some have mentioned, the romance between Liz and Owen is not only pointless but subtly disturbing. He is a thirty-something. She is a teenager. HELLO?Overall, not interesting to its intended audience, though younger children may enjoy it."
2,How To Stay Young and Healthy in a toxic world,"I was not please with this book. It's views and the things it tells you to do are too radical for the average person. The book has some good points to make about our environment and how it affects our well being. However, if you follow everything in this book you will not be able to be a normal person."
2,Good Vendor Service - Poor Product,"The vendor provided this product to me on time and as advertised, but this is a very poor chemistry teaching tool and is very simple and basic."
2,disappointing,"The book is a pretty basic set of simple experiments with some explaination of the principles of chemistry. The experiments are reasonably well illustrated (a bit over-dramatically) and easy to follow, but the materials that come with the set are randomly chosen, certainly not enough to do all the experiments, and almost none of them are things you wouldn't already have in your house. The one thing that really got my kid's attention was the wax and wicks to make a candle, which we did, but the candle wouldn't light because the wick was just some crummy piece of string that melted rather than burning. Bleah."
2,"Incorrect; Pg 12, ""To turn the solid candle wax into a gas burn it. As it burns, the wax vaporizes. it becomes a gas.""","When the wax burns, and the wax combines with the oxygen to form CO2, carbon monoxide, carbon particles (incomplete burning/oxidation) and water. After it burns, you can't get the wax back! The burning has broken the bonds in the wax and made new compounds."
2,Did not like this product!,"My 6yr old is very much into science and received this as a gift from her aunt. It comes with a book that explains the concepts of science and then let's you do the experiment. The book is very colorful and well written but I did not like the experiments. They were just too boring and some experiments would not work. Eventually, we just gave up on the experiments and my daughter lost all the items that the kit came with. We kept the book for reference. Waste of money!"
3,Grandma Approved,I bought this for my little experimentor hoping to be able to have fun while learning.Even though the package was small it held a great many adventures for me to share with my grandchild.
3,Meh,"Caveat: I'm not already into yoga and if you're not already into yoga, this probably won't push you into it. Additionally, it might be helpful to those whose eyesight is better than mine, but the combination of color and font makes it really hard to read -- hard enough that I really haven't tried using them."
5,YAY,My mom lost my yoga deck and finally I bought this one to replace it. This is the same one as before. I like that the yoga deck came wrapped and safe. I always liked the descriptions on how the poses benefit you overall. Satisfied!
5,Fantastic!!,"I started taking a yoga class with some ladies from work and we've all enjoyed it very much. Since we only have class once a week we were all looking for something to keep us going the rest of the week. I happened to find this Yoga Deck and I love it!! I took it to work and one of the ladies went and bought it at lunch time, the others are looking for their copies.This is not actually a book, it's a deck of yoga cards. There are cards focusing on meditations, breathing and of course, yoga poses. Each yoga card shows a pose, explains how to do the pose, gives a mantra to say if you'd like and then explains what the pose will do for you and your body.What I like most about this deck is that you can follow the pre-made routines, targeting different focuses in your life (such as stress relief, muscle flexibility, etc.) or you can make up your own routines.This is a great deck for anyone interested in learning yoga, as well as for those who just want to learn more about yoga."
2,Not worth the money.,"This deck is NOT one of the better ones out there. If you have any kind of medical/physical problem this deck of cards does not give you the necessary precautions. This deck does not replace a good teacher.If your a beginner get the ""KISS guide to yoga"" book --it's very good at explaining things and DK publishers also have the illustrated Iyengar Yoga book ---which is an excellent choice because it will give you good sequencing of asanas and it covers all sorts of medical/physical problems and how to work with them.If you are set on getting a deck --look into ""Basic Yoga for Everybody"" by Gertrud Hirschi, it's a better value."
4,Useful for starting home practice,"I've been practicing yoga for several years now, but always with an instructor. I am using the Yoga Deck to prompt my home practice, and have been very happy with the deck. I lay out the cards in front of my mat while practicing, and use them to prompt my poses for the day. That said, I would not recommend this product for true beginners to yoga, as I find moving between poses and making a logical sequence as something that only has come with experience practicing with an instructor. I don't know that I would find these cards at all useful if I did not have some background in yoga."
3,Mediocre,"Poses are basic (not a bad thing) but the recommended sequences are pretty weak. However, the explanations on the back of the card are fairly good for the beginner yogi."
2,Waste of money,Know these cards are a waste of money. There are many cards wasted with information that could of been placed on the other side of a card with a Yoga pose. Not pleased at all with the product.
2,Pineapple is not the best scent choice,"While all of 100% Pure's body washes are equally gentle to the skin, I don't recommend this particular scent. It reminds me of those scented markers - one always smelled like death rather than the fruit it represented. Yeah ... it's like that ... Go with the Lemongrass."
3,its average,I'd say this is a good movie if you like any skateboarding being done but it is kind of boring. it just shows you what to do kind of. its not bad.
2,Short; mostly harmless,"A nice little SF novel, with geology/meteorology/earth science as the 'S' value. The next Ice Age, the warming after that, and a novel weapon-gadget that explains Charles Fort's rains of fishes, frogs, etc. Old-fashioned, as SF reads: a puzzle to solve, no characters to develop, admire the coolness of the conceit and then move on. Things that make it feel especially dated: no computers, telefacsimile is the state of the art in information transfer (this a couple hundred years into the future, mind), and the whole idea of ""climate change"" meaning glaciation not global warming. The all-woman military of the far future may have seemed far-out radical in 1973, less shocking now.Harmless, but not much better than that. It took me 30 years to get around to reading it, and I wasn't missing anything in that time"
4,"Extract from &#65533;Books on Bosnia&#65533;, London 1999","Over one hundred poets from many countries contribute to this moving anthology of poems written, in the words of the editors, `in whatever measure of solidarity is possible with the victims of this most vicious of wars' (the title means `Slaughterhouse' in Bosnian/Croatian/Serbian)"
4,"HELLO?! INFORMATION, PLEASE!!","I know this will be good, so here's my 4 stars. But could we PLEASE get a few specifications on this product? If it is indeed the long-awaited conclusion to Sadamoto's Eva manga, then it had better be REALLY REALLY GOOD. If this wasn't worth waiting about a year for, I will deem it necessary to buy a ticket, fly to Japan, and slap the $#!+ out of the author.So let's hurry it up with that product image, PLEASE!!!!"
1,Not in English,"this book isn't in english, it isn't even in japanese its in spanish or whatever language is spoken in Argentina. DONT purchase if you're looking for the american release unless you know the language its been translated into."
3,Excellent,"While it took a long time for the seller to ship the product (almost a month, actually), and I even considered reversing my order, the product eventually shipped and I eventually got my guide. The guide was not new, as was claimed by the seller, it did have a few dings in the cover, but all in all it was in pretty good shape. The book itself was very helpful, I enjoyed a lot of the information found in this game guide. For collectors value, this is definitely worth a look. Even for the casual gamer, both the game and guide are worth a serious look. This is hands down the best video game I have ever played, and I found the guide very helpful, especially in certain tricky spots in the game where I got stuck."
3,very very important to have it if you have the game,"This strategy guide is very important if you want to play the game correctly, otherwise you'll be totally lost (except with Final Fantasy games). It has the maps, chests locations, answers to puzzles, etc.I found many mistakes in this guide and also found that the walkthrough was kinda not well written (wassup with those ME notes at the bottom of the pages? why not put them in the chapters they belong? also why not put all the ME, PA, BB, etc in the walkthrough instead of seperating them into parts so we don't need to go back and forward?)"
5,excellent but to much page flipping,this guide is perfect for star ocean it tells you were all the battle trophies are etc. now just cus it is thick it doesnt mean that the guide is awsome the only thing that makes it thick are the pages(there bigger thant atlas pages) so please buy this guide it really helps.
4,Star Ocean Strategy Guide,"This is a great strategy guide, but it has a few miner flaws. Some of the flaws are; it is a little hard to follow, and it's a little vag on things you have to do. But all in all it's a great strategy guide to a great game."
1,Disappointing,"This film does not seem to be sure exactly what it wants to be. The non sex scenes are so boring that I couldn't even make it to the end of the movie.The sex scenes are bland, stiff, and without a smidgen of sensuality. This is NOT a passionate story. Don't waste your money."
5,Synopsis,"""A passionate story of love, sex and longing... After witnessing the aftermath of a rampant sex session between his raunchy lover, Sean, and a city slicker, Mike escapes to the country on his motor-bike with the sole objective of satisfying himself with sex. Will Mike get enough sex and realize he needs his lover, or will he find that the call of the wild is too much temptation? Eight hot guys star in Stephen Bulfield and Mike Esser's latest erotic masterpiece, ""Coming Together"". There's seven scorching and passionate scenes featuring biker Mike, the local policeman, a couple of sexy young farmers and two cute hikers. All produced and directed by the world's most acclaimed gay erotic video team."" _ From Pride Video"
3,A Diarista,"Os personagens sao bem engraados, principalmente a protagonista, a Marinete, mas as estorias nem tanto, tendo as vezes desfechos previsiveis."
5,5 Stars 4 Mantra 2,"I've just received Mantra 2's CD, and I've got to say that it sounds fantastic. My favorite songs are ""Need You Now"" and ""Chant Mantra 2"". There are several other great songs too, such as the remake of ""Werewolves of London"" and the title track ""This is Called Fantasy"". This album is full of wonderfully diverse songs and should not be missed."
4,This Is Called Unique,"Listen no further than the title cut, ""Chant (Mantra 2)"", and you can't help but realize that Matthew Alexander (aka Mantra 2) has a musical sensibility that doesn't fit into any conventional genre. Am I surprised? No, because This Is Called Fantasy reflects years of cross-fertilization between the music of the 80s and the 2000s, between the music of Adam Ant, Warren Zevon, and, say, Amfibian. What you hear, in short, is something you won't hear anywhere else."
5,Best and only review for RCIS Exam,"This is the only study guide available for CCI's cath lab exam. The format is very readable and the graphics extremely helpful. The real meat comes in the explanations - following the questions. The reader feels that Todd enters into a personal discussion with you on the topic of the question - why it is important, tips to remember, why the answer is correct and why the distracters are wrong. The cost is high, but worth every penny when you consider how much work and dedication have been put into it. If you want to pass the RCIS exam you will need these books. They are also good for training new cath lab employees."
4,Thanks Amazon for a difficult find,Unique perspective of exotic culture. A lifetime spent developing friendships with members of an isolated tribe. Unusual creation myths and hunting techniques.
2,Pointless,"Prevas tells nothing new. He is only following Xenophon without any critical reflections. The bibliography is insufficient. there are many interesting reflections and interpretations in the introductions of the different editions of the Anabasis. The motives of Cyrus, The battle of Cunaxa, the double play of Syennesis and Epiaxa, The obituaries of Cyrus and the Generals, the role of Cheirisophus etc. nothing of this is here. Prevas has no opinions- that is well- but he does not know about the opinions of others. A good edition of the Anabasis with a good introduction and notes is more useful than this.That said, the book is well produced, hardback, good paper and good binding & well written. Not totally wasted, Mr. <Prevas, buy you could have done much better."
5,Intro to Xenophon,"Coming from a place of little to no understanding of this period in history, I found this book exactly what I needed to spark my interest to explore further into Greek history. It was an exciting read and difficult to put down. Prevas did well to capture the motion of the story and keep the reader on track with the movement of the troops and how Xenophon reacted to various situation. I also thought the description of the geography and local cultures were fascinating. For a novice like myself I thought it was a great read, both informative and exciting."
2,Meh,"I really thought this album would be phenomenal, but I was let down by much of it. I had this idea in my head that there would be a lot of hidden gems in there, but it's got a lot of slow tracks with an almost country vibe to it. I haven't made it all the way through because I found myself losing interest"
5,Neil Diamond- At His Best..& He Keeps Getting Better!,"I have been a Neil Diamond fan for a long time. His style is very much his own. He gives his listners all they could ask for and then some! His music tells his story....Neil is a very powerful singer & song writer. He has a way of ""touching""everyone that listens to this CD! He's just awesome!!Just when you think it doesn't get any better than this,Neil can create another collection of songs that will, once again, stand the test of time! ""A Music Icon""Thanks Neil,[A faithful fan]"
4,Diamond A Stalwart Pleaser,"It's easy to pick on Neil Diamond's work. As a culture, we've been conditioned to be sarcastic and ""savvy"". We expect our art dark and jaded. You could even say it is now more rebellious to embrace Neil Diamond's music than to embrace someone more ""dangerous"". This, of course, makes Diamond counter-culture, which makes him cool.Each song on this CD is enjoyable. Light? For the most part, yes, but light in a way that reveals the great skills of the singer/songwriter. Catchy, uplifting, or comfortably melancholy, these songs are wonderful examples of why Diamond has been a success for 40 years. Ignore anyone who tells you this is nothing but fluff. Put ""Neil Diamond: 12 Greatest Hits, Vol. 2"" in your CD player and ENJOY it. It's okay. It really is."
3,"Neil Diamond - 12 Greatest Hits, Vol. 2","This is not as good as some of his other GH packages. It's one sliver of Diamond's career. It does have a half dozen excellent tracks. They are mostly late seventies and early eighties cuts. If you are a fan of that part of Diamond's career, you will love this album."
5,The Best is Neal Diamond!,"I love his singing! How can anyone not love to listen to him? I can listen to him all day, over and over. He just make's me feel so good."
3,Oddly mediocre offering from an excellent artist,"It's difficult to consider these 12 cuts something you could call a greatest hits collection. Although several enjoyed moderate commercial success, there is nothing particular memorable about any of the included selections.Aside from the powerful, energetic America and the nostalgic Yesterday's Songs, this is a strangely lifeless group of tunes that could easily slide out of the pop genre into easy listening. That is not to say that this is a bad disc. It is pleasant listening and Neil's singular voice still brings a smile to his fans. Nonetheless, compared to his earlier works, Neil Diamond's 12 Greatest Hits, Volume II is just that, second rate."
1,Diamond Dogs,"12 more from one of the most overrated singers of our time or any time. It almost seems as if this man has been singing ""I Am I Said"" over and over again for about three decades, now. This CD certainly proves that. This is one of those rare CDs which display a total lack of any creative energy from beginning to end."
1,NOT THAT GREAT!,"The book is small such that the author tries to cramp diagrams and tables several pages later after talking about... I get dizzy flipping the pages back and forth trying to learn what the author is trying to portray. If you want a headache when reading about murmurs or any other topic, then definitely buy this book! This is a POORLY ORGANIZED BOOK!"
3,The Singing Fool,Good to see the real Jolson in action. Early movies are kinda corny but I liked it. Really like his singing.
2,early talky,"The acting in this film seemed to be stage acting, understandable as the talkies hadn't been in long. The story seemed to be simplistic and the concept of dialogue was in it's infancy"
1,It smoked when we used it.,"The paint on the blades started to burn off when we were using it, and it fell on the carpet and the ceramic blade fell out. I had a tru ceramic pro from tv years ago and it lasted 10 years. This one seems like a bootleg iron. It looks smaller, is not as heavy , looks cheaper made, and it gets real hot, I mean hot. I don't think it is a safe product, that is why i'm returning it."
1,not the same anymore :(,i had this same straightener about yrs ago when it first came out...and i loved it! they are not made the same anymore. 10 to 15 min to heat up .. then as your straightening...its gets cooler. nope...not the same anymore :(
5,niceeee,"for the price is a very nice piece, i will recomned any one to purches as a gift...or for daily use"
1,MALA CALIDAD,"COMPRE ESTE PRODUCTO, Y HABIA TRABAJADO BIEN, LUEGO DE 2 O 3 USOS LA PINTURA QUE RECUBRE LAS PLACAS DE CERAMICA SE EMPEZO A CAER Y DA MUY MAL ASPECTO, LA CALIDAD ES REALMENTE MUY MALA"
1,not so good,"you see on tv other thing, you use it and it leave your hair with so much frizz, and for curls in did not work.I watched the dvd to learn how to use it and I waste my time and also my money"
4,Mobile Suit Madness,"The most fun in a Mobile Suit Gundam Game I've ever had. You start out with the basics like a story mode and Versus mode and and a hand full of. You can pick from a number of mobile suits from difrent Series and Universes. As you go through the story mode you start to unlock a stream of unlockable goodies. That will take weeks or months to finsih. I've had mine for a around year now and still haven't unlocked every thing. This great for a fan of fighter games or gundam, but either way parts of the game can get tedious like haveing to go through a certian campign 3 or 4 times to unlock every thing. The game has a good style and enough varity to keep you busy for quite some time. But it still is no match for the newer Gundam games on the PS2."
4,<--- FOR G. B. A. 2. THE DATE THIS WAS LISTED IS,"FIRST, TO ANSWER SOME QUESTIONS YOU MAY (OR MAY NOT) HAVE AND TO CLEAR UP SOME WRONGLY SAID STATEMENTS: FOR STARTERS, GUNDAM BATTLE ASSAULT 2, STARTS A PLAYER OFF WITH THREE FIGHTING MODES: STREET MODE, CPU VS.(YOU VS.

THE OPTIONS MOEDE CAN HELP YOU ""WIN"" MORE M. SUITS"
5,Gundam Maniac,"I Have Been hooked on Gundam since 1998 and my heart still burns a healthy fire around Gundam! This Game here: Gundam Battle Assault 2 sounds like the best Gundam Game (that is in English and not Gundam W Wing Endless Duel) ever! I Can Finally pick my fav MS, XXXG-01D2B Deathscythe Hell Custom! (and GF13-001NH11 Master Gundam from Mobile Fighter: God Gundam) and iv heard rumors of JDX-00X Devil Gundam appearing in the game somebody please confirm this for me please! Since i live in Nova Scotia Canada i must wait a while before i can ever see this game....but it will be worth the wait!"
3,NOT AS GOOD,"THIS GAME,..TO ME IS NOT AS GOOD AS THE FIRST ONE SORRY BUT IT'S NOT BAD IT COULD BE BETTER YOU Cn tell this game was rushed"
4,AWSOME,this game rocks! the graphics are great considering that a lot of effort was put in this game. theres a wide range of unlockable gundams ... and it takes a bit of effort to obtain them but its really fun at the same time. overall this game is realy easy to get interested in and you'll be playing for hours.
5,The large ones fall hardest,"I love this game, you can play as Wing Zero Custom, DeathScythe Hell Custom, Burning Gundam, Gundam Maxter, or Gundam in the street modes. The battles can range from hard to easy(with the hardest one being the battle with the mobile suit that three times larger than you). All in all, I love this game, but then again, I love Gundam Wing and G-Gundam!"
4,almost there!,"This game could be the best gundam game on psx. It is fun, has, action and I think it's one of the best 2d games around! I recommand this game to all gundam fans. It's tight!"
3,"""Okay""","I like Mindy, but I wasn't real crazy about this dvd...even though it looked good, initially. It was alright. I will use it again, but it's not my favorite."
4,very nice,Little smaller than i expected but that is my fault. the description did give the measurements. i have not used it yet but it was a very price and it is a solid pan.
1,do not get from amazon at this time,"I ordered it about 3 weeks ago when amazon said it ""ships in 3-5 days"". But since then the shipping status was always pending, untill this morning I found an order cancellation email. they said they could not found it available through any souces. Actually I am very surprised that amazon did not update item availability.So my suggestion is that if you need it like SOON, go local or try the target.com item that amazon carries. You pay shipping but at least you know it is coming."
5,Exxcellent but....,"I love this product because it keeps things fresher. But I wish that the company would specify by length instead of size. I bought the medium size thinking that they would be longer, but they do not cover the distance across of a bags of chips. So if you want longer I guess go with the large size."
5,way better than anything else.,"I bought these after using something similar that I found in the dollar isle at my local drugstore. These work great. I use them on cereal bags, chip bags, frozen fruit bags, and anything else that I want to keep fresh without a lot of hassle. This size works well for all but the giant boxes of cereal and chips. For those you can buy the large ones. Even my 6 year old grandson has no trouble using them to open and close bags."
1,CRAP,"This bbq sauce is terrible, don't waste your money here. It taste like a strange salty bbq sauce. I don't know what the ""organic"" part did to the bbq sauce, but I am positive it was nothing good."
2,Pay for rush shipping!!!!!,"I purchased a double order of this for a large outdoor pond. I am very familiar with this and the stuff grows FAST. I was pleased with the amount of product as an order consisted of 6 nice bundles. Problem is I just chose standard shipping. They shipped within 2 days of ordering and shipped from Washington State. They flew to the Dallas/FTW airport where they sat for days. Keep in mind the temperatures down here have been close to 100 degrees. I can only imagine what they were in a container or closed truck. I received a nicely packaged bundle of stinky, brown, dead plants. The plants were actually HOT as if they had been in an oven!!!! I immediately got them into the water hoping for a miracle but no such luck. I have not even tried to return as i feel it is part my fault for not choosing faster shipping but I do feel they take some responsibility for offering a shipping option that the plants can not handle. Hence the 2 stars. Wasted my money."
4,Good But Dated Book For Beginners in Web Development,I've been working in the web development business for about 12 years. Programming and tech stuff are more my thing. I bought this book because I thought it would help me with the design/graphic presentation aspects. It helped some in that area but is mainly an overview of how to develop websites. An overview of the things that I already knew. Very dated as well. Covers developing websites using tables and lots of references to Netscape 4.
1,Web Expert...NOT!,"I never write reviews. In fact, this is my first one. But, after seeing the only review for this book, I have decided to tell people the truth about it. In reality, the book will not turn you into an expert, not even a beginner web designer. It introduces concepts of web design in a poor and almost offensive manner. Why tell your readers HTML is like a word processor when it is a Markup Language? Why suggest that you use WYSIWYG as your only resourse when WYSIWYG program create (most of the time) illegal HTML code? Suggestions are not practical and, except for the pictures, you can find better information on the most basic tutorial online. Don't be persuaded by the pretty graphics. This book treats you like a 7 years old kid and really teaches you nothing other than bad concepts."
3,Too much info,"This book is tremendous on theory, but horrible on actual usage. I picked it up several times and was never able to get through it, and I don't believe you could ever get an entire team of developers to read, understand and implement the theories in this book.Unless your sole job is UML, I don't know how one would ever find time to get through this book. Perhaps my view will change after I develop a better understanding of UML."
3,"Some good, some bad.","The animation is bad, the sex scenes are silly & childish, & the dialogue is absolutely AWFUL!! ..., BUT the story & the characters are fascinating & worth watching this for. Very interesting."
3,Not Recomended for Children,"This aname is not recomended for children. The quality of the animation is first rate from the beginning to the end. The story line from beginning to end also involves adult situations as to bondage, submission, explicit sex (not hardcore), and for the adult viewer I would recommend that they consider this movie. If you are looking for lots of sword play look elsewhere, the story line has a different intrigue. I was pleased with the movie and am going to be purchashing the Tempist."
1,ugh,"man this thing sucked. even for porn it sucked. See when with movies of this sort try to make some kind of plot thread in something that its main focus is sex its virtually impossible to look at any artistic value or sciprt for that matter. IT doesnt help the hokey ending (she gives up her posistion as queen to be a sex slave once again.......). and has for porn, the animation detail is ham fisted and simple,never arousing enough or particualrly detailed enough. much of this back lash is the simple idea that the focus keeps saying its the plot. But really who are you fooling, you probablly were better not having a plot at all"
3,A bit of a disapointment,"Well...at first i noticed that most of the female characters in this anime..are barely dressed while the men are decently covered..why is that?..second of all Diana realy got me hooked at first but then she yeilded in being a slave..To Sho? coz he's her childhood sweet heart? ...if he really loved her he wouldn't let her go on disgracing herself..he should have married her..thats another thing...and i think the story would have been ten times more exciting if Diana put up a struggle ..like the one she had at the first episode..i think if she had,...Sho would have been more and more into her...And the sex..God the sex!...Its in every scene.!Note the Diana lets Sho take other woman!!...Iw anted to kill her!!I swear...but i liked the characters...If your bored and need something to watch..take this"
4,"One of the best mature anime, i have ever seen!!!","this is one dvd or vhs you must have.. im not about to give it all away here but i will give you the basic's... it is a bout a prince of a forgotten and evil (to some people) kingdom, and a princess of the reformed evil kingdom these two meet and have many adventures in the two movies but the catch is it is a adult like novel in a movie format great story line no to much xxx rated sex but for you who like that kind of thing it has enough nough said it is a great video i have seen it many times and have yet the money to buy it it is realy great.characters:(main),sho""d"" (diannna)through the movie the princess is taken from her land and ends up in a rape and thiefish gang where in this time and setting it is not rape people are allowed to have love slaves and are suposed to be treated by them acordingly. find out more about this movie by seeing it"
1,More of the same from this series,Most of the photographs depicted could have been taken anywhere. The natural beauty of this state has been ignored. This could have been a great series. Very disappointing.
3,Movie,The movie was good but 3/4 the way through something was wrong with the DVD and I was unable to watch the remainder of the movie
2,Running inside out,I found it to be too worldly for my wife and I. We were looking to purchase a number of Christian DVD's this is not one.
2,Lacking,I own hard copies of volumes 1&2. I thought the ebook would be a great addition. It Lacks the plates and color images of fly patterns. I recommend the hard copies.
4,Great coverage,Excellent detail and reference book. Would be better with photos but they really are not necessary. I am an experienced tier and will use the book a great deal.
4,decent but not great,I found this book to be very informative but a bit dry at times. It has a material list for every fly you could imagine but not very good directions for tying them.
5,"Great Quality, Great Design","I bought this shirt for my husband to wear during the Super Bowl, since he planned to view the game with a die-hard Bears fan. Let's just say that die-hard fan wanted to know where we got it, because he loved the design! The price sure is right, too. And even though my husband is a Vikings fan, this is one shirt he wears anyway."
4,Child's Books,"My 2 year old cousin's name is Lily...so I searched for books with that name. I really liked the size, shape and content of the books and that they all fit in the box that comes with them...but I didn't get any feed back after I gave the gift to her (or from the mother)."
2,A long list of things...,"I bought this used, didn't pay much for it thank God. It is certainly less than I expected, basically a vaste list of things too remeber which is not the way I study or review. No pictures, no colour...sorry, those things help me remember since I have a visual memory."
1,Bad Product,"I had the safety 1st monitors like the one pictured at left. They were so horrible I couldn't rely on them for anything! They recieved all sorts of static, and I often heard peoples phone calls on them. They would make clicking noises, and if you turned off the babys unit before you turned off your reciever it would make a horrible high pitched squeal until you turned the other one on that would surely wake up the baby. I hated these monitors and after only using them 3 times gave them away....fully warning the mother about the problems.I now have the Graco Sound Sleep monitors and they are the best ever!"
1,Gilligans Island Complete 3rd season,"I am happy with the speedy delivery. Unfortunately, I cannot rate this for condition of product as I will not open it until Christmas. It is a present for someone.Sue"
5,Crew of the SS minnow make it DVD on season 3. This final season of this classic show finally gets released,"Finally, We have all of Gilligan's Island on DVD at a ridiculously low price! You can get this season for less than $20 . That equals a lot of classic television viewing for the dollar. This set has been beautifully restored with great picture quality and audio! Season 3 is the final season of this classic show! The laughs are in full color on season three! Great Comedy, Great Price!"
5,Absolutely love it!,I never get tired of watching Gilligan's Island. I already had the first two seasons so now I have the third one.
5,This is the set you've been waiting for,"Not that there's anything wrong with seasons one or two, but season three has all the episodes I loved watching growing up; ""Pass the Vegetables, Please"", ""The Producer"", ""And Then There Were None"", etc. All classic in a surreal way. I guess there's only so much 7 people can do on an island before the fantasy/dream sequences come into play. Great entertainment."
4,More Gilligan,If you like G-I you'll love this season. More goofy situations and slapstick. My wife loves this show and we now have all three seasons.
3,Running out of steam,"Though the series seems to be running out of steam,this season was still just as good as the rest of the show.Gilligan and the rest of the castaways are still stuck on the island,and are getting kind of desperate.This season has many dream sequences,and is still really entertaining.Good Luck Castaways."
3,Third Season Is the Third Best,"Season 3 is the worst of the three. Although there are still some good episodes in it, there are too many dream sequences in this season for my liking. It appears as though the writers ran out of island related topics and had to resort to centering shows around strange and bizarre dreams. For example Gilligan dreams he is a vampire, a super spy, Mr. Hyde, an admiral, a cave dweller. Mrs. Howell dreams she is Cinderella. There are a few good episodes but there are too many goofy plots. The strangest show of all three seasons is the one where a professional hunter comes to the island and makes a deal with the castaways where by he promises to rescue them if Gilligan can avoid being shot and killed. This was a little disturbing and not all that funny. With that being said, Season 3 is still better than anything new you see on primetime TV today."
4,Just sit right back and you'll here a tale,"I have been a fan of Gilligan's Island all my life. In my opinion, the third season contains some of the series' best episodes and some of the all-time great entertainers like Rory Calhoun, Phil Silvers and Don Rickles. I would strongly recommend the DVD set to any true Gilligan's Island fan."
5,Brilliant and Underrated,"Someone was asking how customers could review the third season DVD when it hadn't yet been released. Many of us have seen ALL of the Gilligan episodes, having watched for decadeds and taped on vhs. Gilligan's Island is now getting its due respect as one of the greatest all time comedy shows. The writing is simply brilliant and the acting is superb. Denver and Hale will go down in history as one of the greatest comic duos. There is a good reason that Gilligan is the most re-run show in history: it is simply that good and is very, very funny. I can't wait to finally get the 3rd season on DVD and complete our collection. My two boys love Gilligan and the show is a tradition in our household."
5,72 - The Producer,"Season 3 episode 72 - The Producer is my favorite Gilligan's Island episode.(...)72. The Producergs: Phil Silvers (Harold Hecuba)Famous Hollywood director Herald Hecuba lands on the island during his world-wide talent search. The castaways put on a musical version of Hamlet in order to impress the director, with hopes that he will take them back to Hollywood when he leaves.NOTE: The songs in the play are words written from music straight out of the classic opera Carmen. ""To Be or Not Be"" is sung to the words of ""Toreodor"". Who said there was no culture on Gilligan's Island?"
2,Where is the help with information overload?,"The Overwhelmed Person's Guide to Time Management is but one of dozens of ""you can handle it"" titles available today. However, the focus on information overload per se is lacking. This 320-page book is a good seller."
3,Jewels among the outtakes,"Absolutely right! This is not Willie's best by any stretch of the imagination, but there are songs that stay with you for years here. When this record came out, I worked at Peaches Records in Detroit where we were obligated to play it, much to the New Wave crowd's dismay. This was the first Willie Nelson record I ever heard, and though it was another ten years before I was to actually purchase a Willie album, refrains from Tougher Than Leather have stayed in my mind right up until this year, when I bought it on CD. Songs like Summer of Roses, Changing Skies and My Love for the Rose more than make up for the weaker songs like I Am the Forest and Nobody Slides--not that these are BAD SONGS (in fact, they'd be high points in any other singer's career), but they're not up to Willie at his best. But then again, what is? Still, the handful of A-material songs on this one is more than worth the ten bucks you'll pay for it."
1,U get what you pay for,"Unfortunately the cassette I purchased was in poor shape. The first part of the first song on Side A played fine but with in a minute of play time the screeching starting. Purchasing a cassette was not my first choice, but thought it to be safer than vinyl. Should have went with the vinyl. Live and Learn."
1,Lousy Nelson,"Why is this album available, when classic Nelson like 'Me and Paul,' 'Brand on My Heart' and 'In the Jailhouse Now' are out of print? Go figure!"
4,A great toner for younger looking skin.,"Speaking from a man's point of view this is a great skin toner but moreover it makes your skin look defined and younger looking. I also noticed that if you put it on at night before bed and shower in the morning you still have that soft young skin look into the next day. Unfortunitly, summer sucks because you have to use SPF sun screen everywhere you go and applying sun screen over this product kind of defeats the whole purpose."
3,good,"Pros: Rated 1 by Environment Working Group ([...]). Glides on smoothly, easily, and gently (does not pull!)Cons: Does not last, smears easily (esp after a few hard yawns!)"
3,"Happy with product, nervous it's made in China","As other reviewers have noted, this is made in China. I had been using a kajal eyeliner and loved it, but then stopped using it because of reading reports that they generally contain high levels of lead. The Environmental Working Group lists Honeybee Gardens has having a low-toxins eyeliner which is why I purchased this.I think it's a really nice color, and reminds me a bit of the kajal I loved using. It goes on well and doesn't smudge.But, can we really trust a product made in China to not be toxic? I'd pay more for a safe product made in North America."
3,It's ok,I absolutely love the Honeybee Gardens mascara and was hoping to love this too. It's great that it doesn't irritate my eyes at all but it doesn't go on particularly smoothly and the color is not very vivid/black. I'll use the rest but not reorder.
1,Wouldn't buy again,"Made in China. Need I say more? I also got an infection in my eye soon after using the pencil. Not sure if there's a correlation, but I stopped using the pencil two days ago and my eye seems to bet getting better."
1,Diappointing...,"...I had used the author's grammar books and thought this one would apply her methods to writing...unfortunately, it is basically nothing but the exact same stuff as in the grammar books...useful for learning grammar and sentence structure but useless for paragraph synthesis or composition."
5,Frightfully Funny Collection Volume 2,I grew up watching the groovy goolies every saturday morning while I ate Count Chocula seriel. I love the groovy goolies and have so many happy memmorys of them.
5,A Fun Read,"Interesting comments from others but honestly, I found the book thought provoking and entertaining. I highly recommend it."
1,Tacky marketing,"Whether you agree or disagree with the premise of this book (I happen to disagree), it is really tacky on the part of Amazon.com to include this on its list of gift suggestions for Mother's Day. ""Hi Mom! Happy Mother's Day! Here's something to help you realize you're a selfish [w]itch!"" Lovely ..."
5,"Entertaining, intelligently written, thought provoking","Best book I have read in a long time. Very easy to read. A lot of great information. And it even tugs at your heart strings. Excellent writing.Would be great discussion for a book club. A complex look at several complex topics affecting ""the modern woman.""Many great reviews of the book here too. You can tell who has really read the book and who hates the author for what they have decided she represents! I am new to Caitlin Flanagan's work and I am impressed."
3,"Despite the fact that she is self rightous and contradictory, can you really argue with her?","I am a proud feminist and I really agree with her arguments. One cannot ""have it all"" as an employed mother without exploiting cheaply paid domestic labor--at least in my experience you cannot, unless you are lucky enough to have an extended family that is helpful. Even then your children suffer from your absence.Until women can truly say with pride that they are stay at home mothers, women are not empowered to make real choices. I found this book challenging and at times touching--and irritating and whiny and at times repetitive."
1,"For Your Information, Ms. Flanagan","I don't actually have an ""Inner Housewife"" to ""Love"" or ""Loathe"". I think it's awfully strange of you to assume that every woman has an ""Inner Housewife"". Where's your empirical evidence for that? What I loathe is housework - I always have. (I'm actually allergic to dust and mold) My husband understands, because he hates it, too. We do the minimum and then once a month, we pay $75-$90 to get someone else to do the big stuff. Totally worth it, without breaking the bank. And, it saves the wasted time spent bickering about ""chores"". I highly recommend it to everyone."
2,Lucky Ms. Flanagan,"It must be nice to write scathingly about working mothers, while employing a nanny and a maid, and never even once having to iron a shirt. Most working mothers work because they have to, in order to make ends meet. Ms. Flanagan's dismissive view of women who ""choose work over their children"" is cloaked in flippant stories, but it's there. The writing style is nice, but the underlying message is to be avoided, unless you happen to be a very wealthy woman who has a nanny and a maid, but still feel that at heart you are a stay-at-home mom, and no one else is as good as you."
1,what is her problem?,"As many have noted, Flanagan is not a housewife. She's a well-paid magazine writer with a lot of domestic help. That's no crime, but it does make her a hypocrite, since she blames everything she doesn't like about modern life on the failure of women to do the very things she also doesn't do ( cook, clean,focus every minute of waking life on hubby, kids, and house). She cuts herself slack she won't grant other career women and makes all kinds of unfounded assumptions about their lives: their marriages must be unhappy, their children prefer the nanny, if they get cancer their husbands won't take care of them. If you think she's just kidding about wanting the 1950s back, see her lament for the good old days when women performed their ""wifely duty"" whether they wanted to or not. Basically this is an anti-feminist tract masquerading as sophisticated social comment."
2,Don't waste your money,"Okay, so this author quit work to stay at home taking care of her husband and kids. Except she hired a nanny and a maid. So what the heck does she DO all day that makes her any kind of authority on balancing work and home life???"
3,A great book for a book group,"There were many aspects of this book that frustrated and annoyed me, so why did I give it three stars? First, because I think Ms. Flanagan can write using sharp and precise prose. I really enjoyed the poignancy of her first chapter, in which she goes through the minutia of her mother's life. The chapter on over-scheduling our children also struck a chord with me. Overall, I felt that Flanagan was a bit confused over her identity as a mother and a homemaker even as she wrote this book, but her inner conflicts can translate into terrifically heated and passionate discussion opportunities for a woman's book club. If your club is relatively new, pick this book and see how much you can learn about your friends."
3,Snappy woman writes snappy book,"Well, the author is nothing if not passionate and it cannot be denied that her writing style is enigmatic and magnificently engaging. Although it flagged after the tempetous first chapter and the author seemed rather too preoccupied with providing snappy quotes and future soundbites it was worth a read, both laugh out loud funny and moving by turn. Overall an interesting analysis of feminism and women in the USA and beyond."
2,JUST PLAIN BORING,I lost interest in the book as soon I stared reading about her kids; (and maid) this is it a very stupid book to bad I wasted my time and money in it.
5,LOVE this book!,"After reading the negative reviews of this book, I have to conclude that they (the reviewers) are full of anger, jealous of the author's lifestyle, or both. So what if Caitlin has a nanny, cleaning crew and other luxuries you may not be able to afford? I'm sure if you could afford the help, you'd take full advantage of it, too.This book is superbly written, hilarious and thought-provoking. The critics need to relax a little and not be so uptight. I couldn't put the book down and enjoyed it so much that I even took time away from cooking dinner and ironing my husband's shirts <wink> to write a brief review!"
4,"Interesting, funny, moving","I founds the chapter on her illness and how she coped by putting the needs of her children first to be especially moving. I enjoyed the book immensely; she has a great writing style and is passionate about her subject. Don't be put off by the word ""housewife"" or the unearned reputation the author has of being ""anti-feminist"". She is a strong advocate for women."
1,Pathetic,"A disappointing example of soccer mom Stockholm syndrome. A skillful writer, perhaps, but so are many other conservative apologists, which only goes to show that clever syntax is no remedy for a truly dreadful story."
4,"Harsh, realistic film of the child trade","This is a hard look at the evils of the child trade. A private investigator, who makes much of his money black mailing wealthy cheating spouses, gets a case involving a missing child. He then stumbles into the high stakes world of buying and selling children. High suspense. This film was a wake up call to what goes on in the world.Doug Setter, Bsc.Author ofOne Less Victim: A Prevention GuideandStomach Flattening"
2,No sense of design,"With such a cast, all that was needed was a few good plot twists. But no. Neither the writers (Eric and Margaret Leclere) nor the director (Chris Menges) has the faintest idea of how to create convincing tensions and conflicts. The scenes between M. Auteuil and Mlles Kinski and Denicourt all fall flat: they clearly have no idea of what's going on, and neither do we. The disappearance of a son leads to kiddie prostitution and snuff, but what does this have to do with a junkie from a good family? I couldn't watch the whole thing."
2,Hard to watch,"I like Daniel Auteuil a lot and his charming presence led me into a world that I wasn't sure I wanted to enter...the underside of London and the child pornography industry. His friend, a beautiful prostitute, has the contacts he needs to find a missing person for his clients and in his effort to find the fellow he stumbles into the horrific world of child pornography. Because the film was skillfully made and the acting good I kept watching. But at the point where the detective has to look at photos of tiny, small, boys who are the tricks of the trade, I had to shut off the film. It wasn't worth putting this through my brain. I know this stuff exists and I would do anything in my power to put a stop to it. But watching this film isn't going to do it and I chose not to go any further.This isn't saying this is a bad film and it is definitely on the right side of the issue. It is only to warn prospective viewers, which is the purpose of this site, that this is hard to watch."
3,Handicapping 101; Finding the Right horses and Making the Right Bets,"This book takes some reading to get the concepts of determinig race horses that might win. I like a little more detail about a system but for those that aren't system players the book like I said, takes some reading and re-reading to find some tips."
3,A Book For Beginner,"This is a good book for beginner. I especially like the last chapter of this book which concludes all the author's ideas and experiences. This book is also precise and easy to read. This book is a good 101 lesson for beginner.The only negative comment that I have on this book is that the author, like many other US horse handicappers, believes that turf racing does not favor early speed and biases more towards stretch runners. This is not true in Hong Kong and in any other places where turf racing instead of dirt racing is the main stream of horse racing.One more comment: you can skip this book if you are a veteran horse handicapper and you don't have much extra time."
2,Another wretched Amber Smith vehicle,"Oh, Amber, what horrible scripts you're accepting! You were good in Laws of Deception, but your roles have gone from bad to worse.Former Playmate Amber plays a Santa Barbara college student (she's getting a bit old for this) secretly investigating the death of her sister, who was killed by a campus stalker.Amber gets a job with the college radio station - her own late night call-in show. The killer calls her and threatens her in Play Misty for Me style. It seems that to properly investigate things, Amber has to have sex with everyone, including the manager of the radio station (her sister's ex-boyfriend) and her roommate (who also had lesbian sex with her sister). What a contrived set-up for gratuitous sex and nudity!They even show the cops investigating her sister's death having sex. If you like this kind of thing, then you'll want to see this movie, but be warned, the script and acting suck big time."
2,Tell Me No Lies,Amber Smith is beautiful but the movie is amateur hour at its finest. Poor acting and script. Wait for cable and only watch it if there is absolutely nothing else on.
1,Tell Me No Lies,"A truly dreadful video, a sorry excuse to show bare chested, dare I call them ladies? The worst actor had to be the male cop.And just where was Colin Mochrie? He is listed in the cast on this page, but was NOT in the movie, and NOT listed in the credits at the end of the movie, and Colin Mochrie was the sole reason I bought this video. Boooooo, 1 star is too much."
3,Quick moving erotic thriller........,"Plot line similar to the famousClint Eastwood ""Play Misty for Me"" Beautiful Disc Jockey (played byAmber Smith-good actress!) fears for her life ....obsessed radio listenerturns killer? maybe or maybe not! BUY IT! and find out."
5,there is a mistake here,"Patti Souder co-authored the book, you have completely failed to acknowledge the work of Jana Carman, who also wrote this book. Of course, she could just be recieving royalty checks in the mail for absolutely no reason."
4,"it's keller, but not at his best","with all the covers on the cd it seems as if keller wanted to put out a new album asap. this album is not as good as i expected it to be. however, it is keller and this cd will please you (if you love his music like i do). the originals are the high points of this cd (goof balls and crater in the backyard are my favorites, although new horizons is quite good), so don't buy this cd for the covers. as cool as the bluegrass pink floyd and tom petty covers sound, they did not live up to the expectations that i had of them. keller is one of the most talented musicians out there and anything he puts out is worth a listen, but unless you are a diehard fan (like me) i would steer clear of this one and get either laugh, spun, or breathe, all of which are far superior albums. the reason this gets 4 stars is because it still is a very good album, just not a highpoint in the otherwise amazing keller releases."
2,The Worst Season,"Season three had new directors, and new writers. Only one episode was written by a returning writer.This seems to have completely changed the tone of the show. Seasons one and two are science fiction, season three seems to bear more resemblance to Gilligan's Island or Lost in Space.The approach seems to be to throw in whatever fantastic characters the writers could think of, regardless of how stupid or out of place.The third season features Medusa, a Caveman, The Flying Dutchman, The Abominable Snowman, a fire-breathing dinosaur, a two headed dinosaur and a beetle whose bite makes you evil!Logic, continuity and characterization all go out the window. Sleestak and Chaka talk, Enik does stupid things in the name of 'logic'. The only thing better in this season is the acting.The only reason to watch this season is if you want to see all the the episodes for completeness. If you liked the first two seasons, you probably won't like this."
3,Kid Friendly Yes...Adult NO!!!,"Read the other reviews for more insight into Season 3...I will just add that as a 40 year old man, season 3 made me long for season 1! Season 3 is pure crap! My 5 1/2 year old daughter, enjoyed all three seasons, even this piece of crap!!! So if your like me...Someone who remembers this from the 70's...Buy Season 1 & 2 for yourself. Don't buy season 3 if you don't have kids! If you do have kids, get it. Just cause kids are still too young to know just how bad it really is!"
3,too much fruitiness in third season,"the third season of land of the lost adds too many human characters just about every episode. it lacks the eeriness of the first two seasons, and the interest as well.it resembles kroffts more childish work in the third season,but it is still the original land of the lost so it's still great. undeniably part of the legacy.... if you are a beginner to this program, start with the first or second season before getting this one."
4,"land of the lost, complete 3rd series","it was great to see this series again. i hadn't seen this show since i was a young girl, and after seeing it again, has brought back a lot of memories. the dvd is a great quality and i think i need to get other series as my kids are now in to it."
2,Jaws was the best part ....,"Richard Kiel, who played the James Bond baddie 'Jaws' was the best part of Season 3. Other than that, everything else was horrible when compared to Season 1 and 2. The Marshall's even battle Greek villain Medusa in one episode. This show turned into Gilligan's Island for the third season. Way to many changes (story wise), a stupid new theme song, and the horrific addition of Uncle Jack ... bah ... now I'm upset again. By the way, if they would have killed Gilligan, they would have escaped that damn island. Kill Chaka and get home!"
2,So Sad,"Back in the day, I loved LOTL, still do, well at least the first 2 seasons. Season 3 was when the show took a drastic nose dive into the tar pit. An earthquake destroyed high bluff, Rick Marshall got thrown back to his own time, and left Holly and Will in the LOTL. Uncle Jack came into the scene, they moved from High Bluff into the Lost City, right by the Sleestak, Hmmmm, thats smart. Well, I have to say, it sucked compared to seasons 1 and 2, but you have to admit, it was alot better then whats on now, if you can say anything is on Saturday mornings these days.....The show just lost its magic and appeal when they made all those changes, but hey, I bought season 3 just to finish the set. Im gald I did for that reason, but it could have been alot better, but all good things must come to an end I guess, and LOTL did just that...."
1,Terrible...,"I've never been compelled to write a bad review, but this 5 HOUR movie deserves it. Terrible dialogue, cheesy overdubs, bad acting, and the fact that it only showcases the RISE of Mussollino despite its name ""rise and fall"". It builds up only to end with a stupid fencing match with a monoloque discussing what happens afterwards. The finale monologue discuses what would have been the most interesting part during World War II but the movie just falls flat as if they ran out of money or something. Pathetic. The cover shows World War II military equipment none of which has any role in the movie. I'll say it again, Pathetic."
1,what a BORE~ 5hours yawner~ even Antionio Banderas cannot save this lemon,"PLOT: 5 hour mini series of the early rise to power of Mussolini~(leading up to World War 1 yes WW1~what a total BORE this movie is~ Antonio Banderas plays a young and handsome Mussonini who is busy bed hoping and arguing his 'socialist"" ideas. This moves a long very slow~ too slow to keep us interested. a total waste of 5 hours~ after watching the first sluggish 3 hours I fast forwarded through the last 2~ how do you say total Lemon~ do not bother wasting your time.I highly recomend the GEORGE C. SCOTT MUSSOLINI MOVIE THE UNTOLD STORY~ IF YOU CAN FIND A COPY OF IT!~ MUCH BETTER~I GIVE THIS A 1 ONLY BECAUSE IT IS THE LOWEST RATING AMAZON ALLOWS~(it deserves a MINUS ZERO) .... you can could say this a ""D"" movie~ for ""don't waste your time and money""."
1,Misleading cover and title!!,"This is the first time I have ever left a comment on amazon. I was so disappointed by this film and the misleading cover and title, that I felt it my duty to warn others. The movie has dubbed english which is aweful. The storyline and dialogs are over done and therefore lost their meaning.In short, I fully agree with the reviewer who stated, it was the worst movie ever!"
1,The Worst Movie Ever,"I must have been drunk to order this movie..where's the Fall..its so boring,the acting is horrible..overdupped..I got fooled,its so long winded I fell asleep. There was no ending, two discs, where was his fall and all the exciting aspects of his life..I want my money back and I want to return the most worst movie I have ever seen."
2,Mussolini: Rise and Snore,"Mussolini; we all know who this man is. Antonio Banderas stars in this 5-hour flick about the rise of Mussolini. Now, the title is misleading, there is no fall nor much of a close rise, infact, we get Mussolini's start and personally attempts to portray EVERYTHING about him. Really, Banderas is wasted, the movie is wasted, even the $5 you pay plus tax is utterly WASTED! And why? Because the title will lure unsuspecting movie-goers into a 5-hour sleep-fest. I would give more stars if it just said, ""The RISE"". It must've taken 5 seconds after a quick peek at the script for the creators to say, ""Wow, this is going to be awesome.""The good news is that the acting was fair, though it isn't saying too much. Better to skip this fest and if you really want it, you will probably enjoy Mussolini when it is over."
1,Beautifully acted talking head movie,"Beautifully acted talking head movie. We have varied scenes of Benito and his friends discussing socialism in pastures, convention halls, train platforms, newspaper press rooms and even in a Turkish bath. Amazingly, in the short five hours of this dialogue spanning several years of Benito's early life, they even managed to sqEEEEze in a couple of love scenes. The sub plot of Angelica, on again off again non-relationship with Benito kept the movie riveting.I give it 5 stars, exept minus one for NO TIGER TANKS as depicted on the cover, minus another star for NO HE 111 Bomber fleets also depicted on the cover, less another star for NO INVASION OF ETHIOPIA with GAS and those kludged together but interesting looking Italian tanks and finally lose yet one more star for no COMMANDO RESCUE by Otto Skorzeny."
1,A Real Bait and Switch,"What a terrible movie. Not at all what I expected. Anticipating a sweeping biopic of Mussolini's ENTIRE life (especially considering the 307 minute run time) imagine my surprise when the film ends twenty years before the start of WWII! Instead we get Mussolini as a young ne'er do well aspiring Socialist. This is probably the least interesting part of Il Duce's life story. Rise and Fall? It showed neither. A more appropriate title would have been ""Mussolini in Love"" or maybe ""Springtime for Mussolini."" Also, what is with the picture at the bottom of the box? That (and the title) indicates that this would cover Mussolini's actual rise to power as the leader of Fascist Italy. Additionally, on the back of the box there is a picture of footage of German Soldiers in WWII that isn't even in the film! What is that about? If you are interested in Mussolini I recommend you sit this one out. If all you want to see is Antonio Banderas mug for the camera then I would suggest Zorro."
3,The complete series is 3 dvds long,"Sorry to say that this item contains only the first of 3 dvds which complete the whole series. If you check the title ""a man named Benito Mussolini"" which is an import from Latin America, you'll see what I mean. Unfortunately the Latin American version only has audio in English (aufully dubbed from the originaly Italian), but it is worth watching."
2,HP is misleading you,"I recently purchased this item with the hopes of creating DVDs of family events and such for easier distribution. The drive works fine on CD, CD-R, CD-RW (if proper software installed), DVD, and DVD+RW. The drive however will NOT, I repeat will NOT recognize DVD-R or DVD-RW discs. This is mentioned only by omission in the packaging and if you want to record DVD for distribution you need to get DVD+RW discs which are more expensive and more difficult to find. In a word I am VERY unhappy. I give the drive 2 stars only because it was able to deal with what it was able to deal with fairly effectively and once I contacted HP they did their best to explain the problem. But this is obscenely misleading product labling and irresponsible of the manufacturer to release this without clearly explaining what the situation is..."
2,Wait for the new DVD2002 from HP,"The DVD100i does NOT write to the cheaper and more available DVD+R format. This is due to the fact that HP rushed the drive onto the market more than a year ago in order to gain market share.HP also reneged as I understand on a promise to make the firmware on the drive backward compatible with DVD+R.In April, the new HP drive will come onto the market. This will burn onto the DVD+RW and DVD+R format, saving you a bundle on media and frustration."
1,Avoid this...,"This product is a slap in the face for anyone who has ever believed HP is quality. I am no n00b and this ... has wasted an afternoon of my time being unable to format even the DVD+RW disk that came with the machine, much less a CD-RW or CD-R. If this is Carly's idea of the new HP (i.e., Compaq quality ...), she has succeeded. It has ruined my feeling towards the HP namesake. The install utility is marginal and the drive is not even that -- it screws up more than it suceeds. YES, I am using DVD+RW disks... .... SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!"
1,Compatible - Bah humbug!,"It gets worse. Basically, DVDs written on this drive will not read on any other non-HP devices I own (I've tried four, Panasonic and Toshiba). The first HP tech I spoke to told me to factory-restore my system becaused that somehow would update the firmware in the DVD-writer. Hmm. The second tech told me the problem might be the reflectivity of DVD+RW and I should try DVD-R. I told her twice the 100i did not support DVD+R, but she insisted. So I bought some media and sure enough, it *doesn't* work. The third tech I spoke to (speaking for his supervisor) told me that basically it wasn't really HP's problem if the DVDs didn't read on any non-HP drives.Bottom line: if you are interested in sharing video DVDs with other people, DVD+RW is a waste of money. Stay away from it. Get something that supports DVD+R."
4,Not a bad deal!,"Not a Bad product at all, A little disappointed for the DVD+RW will work on only the most Current DVD drive, I am a Computer Greek, tested the DVD+RW disk with HP OMNIbook 6100, 6000(one year old), Pioneer DVD Burner, Compaq Laptop with DVD, So far only Omnbook 6100 able to play the disk. Wait for the newer product that support DVD-R as well as DVD+RW if you are not in the hurry.Able to purchase DVD+RW media for around $7.00 a piece, I have owned 5 CD-burner so far they all have their weakness.Now I can put 7 cd materials into one media, it really save my time.The suppled software are laughing material and will not work on my NT, Window 2000 server. Instead I am using Nero rom to record my stuff now.Guy, there are no perfect product anywhere."
2,Don't buy this if U are looking for compaibility with dvdrom,"I purchased this writer and I am sending it back, it came with 1 DVD-RW and 1 CD-RW. After using the DVD-RW for a few times it stopped working, the DVD-writer damaged the disc...."
2,Missing DVD-R compatability,"I was impressed by the price and features of this new HP product, until I found out it was not compatible with DVD-R.I have to give it 2 stars for HP's decision not to make it clear in their documentation of this product. It is easy to overlook it's omission when comparing DVD recorders.Aside from this shortfall, I have found my other HP products to be adequate performers, and have good customer support behind them. I would trust that the product performs as described, but I cancelled my order due to lack of DVD-R support.If your archiving videos, DVD-RW is an expensive alternative to DVD-R."
1,Hewlett-Packard DVD100i DVD Writer,"HP tries to give you the impression that DVD+RW is compatible with ""most standard DVD players and computer DVD-ROM drives"". Well, in my experience that's not true. I've tried two different Panasonic DVD players and two different Toshiba DVD-ROM drives. The DVD+RW discs won't play on any of them. All of the equipment is fairly new - most of it bought within the last year. So, if you're hoping to play your DVDs on home video equipment, I strongly suggest you get something else. The HP drive can't write DVD-R. Mine is going back..."
1,A big loser,This drive does not record to DVD R disks it only wrights to DVDRW disks these disks do not play on home DVD players. If you plan to record DVDs to play on home DVD players this is not the product. a realmisleading product.
4,DVD-RW Drive,"Product has excellent backwards compatability with current on the market DVD's (70-90%). Installation was not that hard. Would have given a 5 except that current support for Windows XP is not documented well. In general most of the documentation is lacking. 5 for hardware, 2 for documentation, 3.5 for software, which is included, but needs to be upgraded if you use XP."
5,Brings Back Those Old Memories...,"I remember being a youngster when my Dad brought home this album for me and my little brother. I was so young that I was still in pajamas with feet! That year it became a staple at the Smith household. There were a few things that made CHRISTmas special at our house...all of the goodies Mom made, favorite ornaments, seeing Peepa up from Texas, going to church on CHRISTmas Eve thanking God for the gift of Jesus, and three records: The original Johnny Mathis CHRISTmas album, The Captain Kangaroo CHRISTmas album, and Holiday Sing-Along with Mitch Miller. When I hear the beautiful music of this last album I am immediately between the ages of five and ten and then the magic is back. What a great feeling! I have since added MANY CHRISTmas CDs to my collection, but this is one of my all time favorites! Merry CHRISTmas to you all!"
5,Great memories,My sister and I used to listen to my dad's old LP for hours on end when we were kids. One day I was browsing Borders and saw they had this. I had to snap it up. I even made copies of it for my parents and sister. They were surprised I remembered this.
5,this holiday classic stands the test of time,"Like many other reviewers, I first heard these songs when I was a kid, but nostalgia value aside, I think this is a terrific selection of holiday music performed very well. In general an all-male choir sings four-part harmonies of these tried-and-true songs using conventional but pleasing arrangements, and you can easily sing along using the accompanying lyrics. The CD contains three bonus tracks -- Deck the Halls, Silent Night and Auld Lang Syne. Great holiday fare."
5,Brings me back to my childhood,My parents had this record when I was growing up. A few years ago my sister found the CD and told me about it and I bought it last year. It really brings back some great memories when I listen to the music.This CD is a definite holiday MUST!!
4,memories.....,oh what fun to listen to again! Brings back so many childhood memories at Grandma and Grandpa's house.
5,My all-time favorite!,"When I was growing up, my mom would start playing Christmas music on Thanksgiving. The highlight for me was always singing along with Mitch. I loved to read along on those big lyric sheets that came with the record. This was a tradition in my home. I can't tell you how thrilled I am to find this album on CD this year!!! I bought copies for my parents, my 2 brothers, my sister, and me. I just had to share the memories and the joy of the season. I'm sure my children will have their own copies very soon, too. If you can have only one Christmas album, this is the one. Merry Christmas to all!!!! And happy singing!!! Warning: smiling is unavoidable."
3,OK Album,After a while the songs all sound alike on this album and it gives you a headache. I would recommend listening to samples of the songs and only downloading the songs that appeal to you.
5,Brings back memories,"I was looking for a particular Christmas song that I almost never hear. Then one day I heard the song on the radio and the announcer gave the name of this album. That's when I found this album with the song "" Must be Santa ""My son sang that in a Christmas program at school many years ago.Anne in California"
1,terrible,Terrible product bought 3 copies oc cd and after playing them some songs skipped.Tryed in auto plus home stereo and portable stereo all skipped. Would like a refund please. Mike
5,Back to the 60's with Mitch,"Baby boomers should thank the record label for finally releasing this on CD. Each song has that unique Mitch Miller sound that made our chilhoods in the 50's and 60's special, a quick trip back to a simpler time. The album (and now the CD) is one of our most cherished holiday music collections."
5,Mitch Miller Holiday Sing-along,My record of Mitch Miller Holiday sing Along is getting worn out - please bring this back either on cassette or CD and send it to me as the first availability - thank you
5,Holiday Sing a long,"This is an album that my parents played every year at Christmas. The songs are so cheerful, easy to sing along with, and all kids love the corny but Christmas-y songs. It's become a family tradition for us to play this album while decorating the tree or making X-mas cookies."
5,Mitch Christmas rocks!,I used to listen to this music all the time when I was a kid--it really gets you in the Christmas spirit and is a ton of fun to listen to!
5,Family Favorite to Teenage Torture to Nostalgia,"This was a family favorite in our house growing up. We listened to it on a record player. When we became teenagers, to wake us up, my dad would blast it really loud at 8:30 xmas morning as payback for our younger years of getting them up at 5:30 yelling ""He came!"". I can't wait (not this xmas, evidently) to buy four copies on CD for myself and each of my brothers. I hope I'm not disappointed."
4,christmas cd,i recieved the cd in a timely manner and looked forward to having it for my xmas collection . i've heard this xmas album since i was a kid and always liked it .
5,brings back memories,"Remember this album from childhood.had to get it for my 6 yr.old daughter,who loves anything christmas. she loves it as much as i did and still do."
3,Middle of the road,"I enjoyed this album somewhat, but in the end it didn't hold my attention as an ambient or shoegaze album, too much going on that interferes with being able to just chill with it. Some interesting music here, but not my cup of tea. If you like the more experimental side of shoegaze/ambient, then check some of these tracks out. I am more of Eno, or Seefeel kind of person."
4,helpful for repetitive strain injuries.,"great support for carpal tunnel syndrome & tendinitis. however, for me, i have to tighten the braces and readjust the metal pieces for optimum comfort. consequently, the tight braces can cause mild discomfort & excessive moisture accumulation. have to wash them regularly. best ways for repetitive strain injuries are good ergonomics/posturing, decrease the repetitive works, frequent breaks, etc."
3,Not that great,"I have pinched nerves and wear wrist braces on both wrists. So, when I saw these and saw they are reversible I was happy because I could not find a matching set. I didn't want to wear two different ones and the ones I bought from the actual medical supply store were $36 a piece and wanted a pair to wear around the house while cleaning etc. These came and once you reverse one they don't look the same or fit the same. The part you put your thumb through was awkward on the reversed splint so I returned. I just wear the expensive ones at night while I sleep and deal with it the rest of the time."
4,Not for beginners,"This dvd oesnt really explain how to do anything. It shows alot of diferent techniques and positions, but if you are not someone that can learn on the fly then this isn't the dvd for you."
3,Two drawer chest,I think that this product is a little over-priced. I'm curious how it will hold up in the long term. The wood is very light-weigh.
1,Down with whitey!,"Honestly I think that the acting in this movie was done pretty well. I mean it wasn't a block buster cast, but pretty good, they felt real. However, the entire scope of the plot seemed to be about how ""whitey keeps the brotha down"". Give me a break! These kinds of movies are the left fueling the fire of racism when the rest of us are trying to leave it in the past. Racism has no place in this Nation today. Don't believe hollywood."
1,dont buy!,"I just drilled 30 holes in 17 gauge hot rolled steel (soft steel) and 3 of the drill bit diameters I used resulted in both chipped and crushed cutting edges. To top things off the shafts on all three of the bits are soft as well and the jacob chuck clamp created grooves on the shaft 1/32"" of an inch deep. The bits wont even go back in their cheap plastic cartridges because of the mangled shafts. I am looking to replace them with higher quality steel alloy bits asap."
5,Irving Industrial M-42,I was very pleased with the overall quality of this drill bit set. The storage box is very nicely made and works well even when left open as I do. The drill bits have performed flawlessly and cut through 3mm steel with ease. It's early in the game for me but so far I am very pleased with this purchase.
2,Not as described.,"The larger bits in the set did not have a reduced shank to fit a 3/8"" drill chuck, so I sent them set back. I sent Amazon an email of the description error but they have not made the correction."
5,intro,anyone new to his music should start with this cd. it gives a summary of his range and musical influences that made him the artist he is today.
4,"Great Show, ok editing!","This is a Great Performance from Robert plant. However, I don't think this is the complete performance. Also, this concert is interrupted by interview segments between many songs. These two issues is the only reason it got 4 instead of 5 stars."
5,Band of Joy Indeed!,"I saw the Band of Joy play at the Greek Theater in L.A. about two months after this show was filmed. Very similar show and just as great. I've watched the DVD several times, and find myself wanting to watch it again and again. This seemed like a real band, in which all of the members really expressed themselves. I wish Robert Plant had kept the Band of Joy together because they were onto something really good. Overall, the feeling is very warm and positive, as this DVD illustrates."
4,Very nice DVD,"I enjoyed the music and the group, but it is still hard for me to separate Robert Plant from Led Zepplin.... who in my mind is still the best Rock band ever."
5,BEST,DVD I HAVE SEEN IN A LOOONG TIME....GREAT PRODUCTION AND OF COURSE ARTISTS...... I RECOMMEND IT TO ALL MUSIC FANS
4,Robert Plant and Group Rock the Den,"Great Blu Ray of Robert Plant and Group playing some great music. The only down side is it took me 15 minutes or so to get the sound to be decent through adjusting several settings on my system. Not sure why the producers didn't take more care on getting the sound correct. Once fixed, this is very enjoyable and one that I will play for a long time. It doesn't hurt that Patty Griffin is very cute!"
3,No energy,"Not what I expected, I think the performance is lacking energy. If your are a big Robert Plant fan and dont mind a dead concert, then go for it."
1,"Oh, the possiblities!","The Lextrix 0401 SaladXpress Electric Salad Center has such possiblities. However, I did find flaws with the product. First of all, food easily got wedged between the slicer and the lid. Also, you need to hold the button in while the machine is spinning, thereby taking away from the ease of doing something else while the salad is spinning dry. Everytime the lid is lifted, the plugger plops out. So annoying. Also, the chute seems a little too short and too close to the blade. This product could be a handy one with some adjustments to the design. It would be convenient to be able to spin salad dry and hold the baby at the same time. However, the worst thing, once again, about the product is getting food caught between the lid and the slicer mechanism. It would also be dandy to have a seal tight lid to store extra salad. For some reason, it may have been newness, but the motor had a burning smell to it."
1,Lectrix Salad Spinner,"Overall this product is exceptional. Easy to use, assemble and clean. However, the shaft on which the blade spins seems to have a design problem. Out of the three Salad Spinners that I have had and given as gifts, two of them are defective. On one of them the shaft casing has cracked making it all but impossible to change the blades. The second one has a shaft that has too much play in it. When assembled the shaft comes too far down allowing the blade to come in contact with the inside basket and obstructing its ability to spin.Make sure to know the return policy before purchasing this item, or you may be stuck with it."
2,not as pictured,"the ring doesn't look like the same ring from the picture. the black detail in non existent, and the stone is very dull, and has none of the blue hue shown in the picture, mine looks just like glass. i was so excited when i ordered it, but extremely disappointed when it arrived."
4,Moonstone Ring,"It's a little weak and smaller than I thought, but I still like it, and it came quickly."
4,great tool,easy to use only problem it doesent cut all the way thru great tool for the price saves a lot of time
1,Just Say No Phoebe!,"Megadates.com gets 2 stars because of her sense of humor (that's the good part). Then again, if I were _____ing every Tom, Dick (no pun intended) and Hairy (touche') I guess I'd have to laugh about it too.Almost every chapter centered around her ______ing her latest date. Being as old as she is (50 something), you'd think she'd know how to say no. After the third chapter I began to get bored because you basically knew how the chapter was going to end...in bed.I don't want to come across as judgmental, but the book was a turnoff. The author seems like a woman who has a serious problem with self esteem. Megadates.com did nothing to enlighten me about internet dating."
3,It's OK!!!!,This book might help you when you really need it. But I don't really recommend this very much to viewers who read it.
5,Youth Pastor give rave review,"I think this book was written at a good time. If it would have been written in 1985 or even 1995 I think the illustrations wouldn't have been as timeless as this. While media is ever changing I think this book will stand for quite a while. I needed a good book on video games for sermon material and for the parents of the teens in my youth group. Excellent, excellent book."
2,Great,"This book, and the idea it supports, is garbage. Video games are becoming yet another excuse for bad parenting, following in the footsteps of television.Parents: stop trying to play the victim and raise your damn kids yourselves."
3,"Good, but...","This book seems to have potential until chapter four, where it loses its momentum as the authors bring in religion to their argument. There is current research on computer and video game addiction - it is a real and serious problem. Unfortunately, this book, with its religious undercurrent is an immediate turn-off for those searching for objective science on the topic."
5,4192,"Pete is the man. Great video, a lot of history with the man. If your a fan of baseball pick up the movie."
5,Didn't Disappoint!,This was a Christmas gift for my father and he LOVED it! Would definitely recommend it to any Pete Rose or Reds fan.
5,Great watch,Very good film about an often overlooked part of MLB history. Despite what we know Pete did to end his career there is no way you can overlook his accomplishments. The best part about this film is how vividly he recalls memories of his playing years.
4,important skill,"for preschoolers as a pre-reading exercise. helps kids to read, write books, tell a story...."
5,Mathematics for Business,"This is a very good text that provides useful and practical information for the real world of Business. It is good for students who majored in accounting, finance , economics ...etc."
1,DOES NOT COME WITH MY MATHLAB ACCESS CODE,"Beware before purchasing this book, it does not come with mymathlab access code! If you're instructor wants you to access mymathlab throughout your course, you need to purchase it separately for $80 at the book's website. Don't waste your money, buy this book with the access code at your college bookstore."
4,Excellent introduction to the world of Zuni fetish carvings,"An excellent guidebook of the wide variety of Zuni fetishes carvings available today. McManis goes into some painstaking detail of Zuni cosmology in the introduction, then gives details on each of the animals that are frequently carved now in Zuni, and finishes the silm volume with a discussion of four Zuni carving families accompanied by genealogical tables and a list of active carvers as of 1998. Photographs are extremely well done, however, there are no close up details of fetishes, given that there are families like the Cheamas and the Kaamasees now producing extraordinarily detailed and lifelike ""non-traditional"" fetishes. A must have reference for anyone beginning or enhancing a collection of these fascinating carvings. Volume #2 covers the extensive range of materials used and details additional family groupings."
3,A small bit of nice spice,"I was looking for parsley flakes in bulk. The .25 oz bottles at the grocery store are too small, so I thought a 1 oz bag would be fairly large. It's not. The bag holds a little more than what you would get in a bottle from the store. (It was about the same amount as the 7 oz bag of mustard seeds.)"
5,Finally zinc at 100%,"This is a very well balanced formula of zinc and copper that will make your skin look amazing, I use to have some normal occasional breakouts in my face and in my back, it was really not that bad, but it cleared it like BAM!, It makes my skin looks amazing and that was what I was looking for as well as I feel overall healthier with this product, I'm now taking it every single day LOVE IT... :D"
2,"FYI, not vegan/vegetarian","Bought it thinking it was a vegan option. It isn't. My bad, should have looked closer as they use gelatin capsules."
1,You better already know your classics or you'll be confused!,"This book was really irritating. If you already know your classics, then perhaps you too will think ""it's funny""; but it is hard to dissect which is the ""funny"" stuff input by the author and which is actually from the classic."
1,It would be good if this were funny,I admit I didn't buy this book---I leafed through it in a bookstore. I read enough to know that you better have actually read the Iliad to appreaicte this. And I suspect if you had read the Iliad you'd probably think this was a waste of time.
3,Is DEFINITELY Hysterical If ...,"... you've read the classic upon which the 5-minute translation is based. If you haven't, THE 5-MINUTE ILIAD AND OTHER INSTANT CLASSICS still provide plenty of merriment -- with maybe a touch of confusion. (In particular, Bram Stoker's ""Dracula"" is an absolute howler and George Orwell's ""1984"" might even have you running to pick up a copy of the original to find all of the hints.) While a few of the 'instant classics' do feel like one-note jokes that go on for several pages, it's still all in good fun at no one's expense ... other than a few of civilization's most revered authors. Nagan's observation's about Western Civilization and the expanse of its subsequent culture, however, are perhaps the finest notes of pure mirth in the book ... I'd almost wish he'd dedicate a book to that subject alone!"
4,Cliff notes for smart alecks,"I was at a restaurant tonight and there was a drunk guy at the bar talking very loudly to a woman about classic works of literature. His summaries were unintentionally very similar to the ones in this book. If Monty Python's ""Gumby Cherry Orchard"" sketch makes you chuckle, you'll probably find plenty to laugh at here."
2,A girly book,This was ordered for my book club selection but I personally didnt like it. Nor did many others in our group. So there's that.
1,Stay far away from this thing,"I bought this for our office. Worst expenditure we ever made, despite the cheap price. WinFax hasn't been supported for years. This version was the first (and last) to support WinXP, so you can imagine the bugs. On most machines, we couldn't get it to work. On one machine, it would try to reinstall itself every time we restarted the computer - even if we allowed the reinstall to happen.By the way, this software uses your phone line to send and receive faxes. Very old tech. Better solution: subscribe to an online faxing service. That's the present and future of faxing.[...]"
2,Suprisingly disappointing Kit,"I'm not sure if Model Companys subcontract their kit production, but this kit isn't like other Minicraft models I've built. Poor quality casting is my big complaint, especially with the rubber tires. Fit is another problem, I can't believe the amount of cutting, sanding and scraping I had to do to get a lot of assemblies to fit and I'm not talking about flash or spru stubs. Also, design of some parts was questionable at best. Some of the major stress points such as door and hood hinges were so small that no amount of super glue could hold them together for long."
4,Most of you seem to miss the underlying point,"I find it shocking that almost everyone saw this as a retread of the Romeo & Juliet or West Side Story kind of forbidden love tale when the device the plot actually hinges on is the Biblical Song Of Solomon and the Ethiopian legend of Solomon & Sheba. The story and plot follow the story told in the Song Of Solomon much more than they do Romeo & Juliet. As a Jewish man, who happens to be a hip-hop artist, that is married to a Jamaican Rastafarian Brooklynite woman, maybe I found this story just way too irresistable.No Brooklyn Babylon isn't a cinematic classic, but it beats almost everything else geared towards the young urban demographic with it's intelligence & relatability."
4,Wheres The Soundtrack?,"Excellent music, excellent performances by the roots and even Spragga Benz, I'd like to get the soundtrack if its available. The story bases itself loosely around the Song of Solomon, and lets you know of how the rastas see themselves as descendant of Solomon (jewish king) and Sheba. The garden scene and others all mirror that earliest and greatest of love poems, and that's where the narrator gets his stuff from. I thought the movie was better than most people did, maybe a little cliche, but well acted, not overacted, and just good to watch, good brooklyn scenes. Even the cameos are well done (slick rick)."
3,It is okay,This dvd contained only three shows were as Friends and Enemies and Little Green Girl each has fives shows. I recomend buying Friends and Enemies and Little Green Girl which have everything on this dvd and a whole lot more.
1,STREETS OF FIRE,"I HAVE BEEN BUYING DVD'S FOR SOME TIME ON AMAZON BUT LATELY I HAVE BEEN RECIEVING DVD'S THAT CAN'T BE PLAYED,THIS IS THE 5TH ONE I RECIEVED. I SENT BACK TWO AND EAT THE OTHER 3 AND I'M TIERD OF THIS HAPPENING.I RECIEVED REGIONAL DVD'S,HD DVD'S, VHS, AND NOW CODE DVD'S THAT I CAN'T PLAY, WHEN ORDERING YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO EXPLAIN TO THE SELLERS WHAT YOU WANT,I'M SURE I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE WITH THIS PROBLEM. THANKS HAROLD LOGINS"
5,"If the women don't find you handsome, they should at least find you handy . . .","If you ever saw the show you know . . ., if not, you're in for an unexpected treat. Just be sure that all your food is safely put down and tray tables are locked and seats in the upright position as the ensuing laughter can be dangerous to furniture, family and friends alike. A must have for every would be 'handy' man."
3,Not great / not quite what I was expecting,"Another reviewer mentioned the low quality footage of this DVD. That doesn't bother me too much - the picture is clear enough to get the point across.This DVD did have a few useful tips - I did learn a few things. But only about 7 or 8 of the ""60 Tips"" were relevant to me. There was no advice here regarding water skiing or fishing safety.And, there really weren't 60 tips (i.e., Tip #1 is Be Careful, Tip #2 is Different Sized Boats Behave Differently).Also, about 1/3 of the tips were about dual engine boats, which didn't apply to me. And, another 1/3 of the tips deal with leaving the dock/slip. I don't have a dual engine boat, or a slip, so none of this was useful to me.But if you are fairly new to boating, have a dual engine or larger boat, and experience a lot of traffic in the marina, there would be a lot of useful information here for you."
5,Great movie...,Get some tissues for this one as it will tug at you tears.... Great story of love and dedication. Based on a true story.
5,one of my favorites,Grab a tissue while watching this! True story about a dog that waits for his owner at the train station every day after the owner dies (Richard Gere). True love. A must see.
1,"Not for children, not really that great for adults either",We watched this with our children not realizing how sad and depressing it would be. It filled them with sadness. As for an adult perspective the movie moved slower than slow as a story that could have been completely told in about 10 minutes was painfully stretched to 90 minutes. I wish I could have back the few hours of my life I wasted watching his movie!
5,Powerful,This movie made a huge impact on me. Its simplicity makes it one of the best movies I've seen in a very long time and I've been recommending it to everyone. Please take time to watch this one. The only thing that could have made it better was to have seen Clint Eastwood in the lead role! :)
5,Hachi,"I loved this movie with Richard Gere, it is sad at the end when the dog dies from old age waiting for his owner to come back home who had died!"
4,Good movie for dog lovers,A well-done movie--especially good knowing that it was taken from a true story. Good for both children and adults; dog lovers will like it.
3,"2/3 Great, 1/3 Bad","I don't see what is so great about the last third of a movie that is quite depressing and drags viewer down, down, down. So that if is how the real story was (supposedly), they could have summarized that part in the last few minutes with the kid telling the story and focused more on the bond between Hachi and Gere's character. As some have mentioned also, it seems the other people in Hachi's life were stupid and the dog needlessly suffered because of it. This could have been a great film, but the ending sinks it."
4,a fine remake of an adorable dog,"I saw the original Japanese version a long time ago, which is pretty awesome. And I think this US remake did a pretty good job. With a touching story like this, I guess it's hard to go wrong. I especially appreciate the director and the cast for not having made it too sentimental. For those nippers out there, you can't miss it. Hachi is so adorable and dignified, although it pains me in the end because I wished the dog hadn't done what it did. But dogs are dogs,they have their own mind, which makes them so precious. As an animal lover myself, I hope everyone who has a dog can just treat it the way it deserves. Of the animal kingdom, human included, dogs are definitely a better being."
4,Dog Tear Jerker,"This IS NOT an action-packed movie. There are no multi-million dollar special effects. It's a slow and methodical story, based upon true events, which portrays the dogged (pun intended) loyalty of Hachi. I believe that the true story occurred in Japan, but for purposes of this movie, the story was ""transferred"" to the U.S. If you're looking for action, this is NOT your movie. If you're interested in a story about the connection between man and dog, it's a great watch. There are moments that will bring tears to your eyes; well, if you're human!"
3,SLOW plot,"This movie is well made but drags on and on. While there were some cute scenes, I wanted more from the story. I would like to have seen how the original story in Japan played out."
3,Haven't Had A Chance To View It Yet.,I know I'll love it but just been gone & haven't hada chance to view it yet but will by this weekend (Feb 8-10th).
4,wish for another Hachi,i saw this movie long ago so i wanted it in my Blueray collection. the product is good and it didnt take long to receive it. i live in New York.
5,Hachi: A story of loyalty,"For anyone who loves dogs and understands their loyalty to their owners, this movie is for you. It is based on a true story of a dog named Hachiku that waited 10 years for his deceased owner to come back for him (look it up on the internet). Of course, this is the Americanized version of the true Japanese story, but it is, by all means, a fair account. Be prepared to cry your eyes out, though, because as this story proves, the true loyalty and unconditional love of a dog for its owner is very special."
5,Hachi: A Dog's Tale,"Loved this movie! Liked it because it's a true story. So touching, artfully done. Makes you cry every time you see it. Dog lovers will especially enjoy it. Just a good story that touches the heart."
4,Great Movie,"This movie was a true story of loyalty at its best. I shed many tears throughout the movie. There is no doubt a dog is our best friend, male or female."
5,please watch,"I will not recap as others have been sufficient.All I can say is that Field of Dreams is may favorite movie ever. I am a dude, and I did not cry during it.I cried like a little girl watching Hachi. Anyone that loves dogs or animals in general needs to watch and have your best friend nearby."
5,Beautiful story,You can't help but fall in love with Hachi and feel the gamut of emotions as you watch this move!! Don't forget the kleenex.
5,best dog movie,"I love this movie and so does any one I know that sees it.very emotional,heart warming and entertaining Highly recomended for anyone who loves animals"
4,Very Good Movie,"Very good movie, but also quite sad, just to prepare you. Great acting on the dog's part, the people did okay too."
5,one of the best movies ever made,"Seen it several times, and cry like a baby each time. When I ordered the movie, I also ordered a copy and had it sent to some relatives. I just had to share what I thought was the most enduring and touching movie ever!"
5,Loyalty to the nth degree...,My 12 year old Staffordshire Terrier died not too long ago and this movie allowed me to memorialize him once again and to remember how he was the essence of loyalty and unconditional love. This story is a great family film and more than that it speaks of living in the now.
5,Hachi,This was a beautiful story....I gave a copy of it to my granddaughter who thought it was wonderful.I really enjoyed it.
4,"good first half, upsetting second half","I saw this movie on the Hallmark Channel this weekend. It's based on a true Japanese story.Plot:One night, after returning home from a trip, a college music professor finds a stray Akita puppy at a train station. Several years later, after forming a very close bond with the dog, the music professor dies. Hachi keeps vigil outside the train station for about 10 years, until he passes too.I enjoyed the first half of the movie. However, I found the second half to be rather upsetting, seeing the dog grieve himself to death, living life as a stray. Definitely be sure to have plenty of tissues on hand for the second half of the movie."
4,Amazon,"This movie seemed so interresting and glad to own it. Cant wait to see it, and now can watch it all we want."
5,Boo Hoo,Man what a great movie. I can only handling watching it once a year. For the dog lover in all of us!
2,depressing!,"I was really disappointed with this movie. I like the Japanese tale much better.This movie was not about loyalty, it was about not being able to let go or move on. Ten years later the wife comes back to the same small town to visit, and she looks like hell, still as depressed as the day her husband died. Why hadn't she tried to move forward in her life? The dog got older and more beaten down as the years passed him by.Loyalty is one thing, but living in the past is another. Could have been so much more."
2,Just does not click!,"My wife and I were really looking forward to viewing this movie as we love animal movies of all kinds, especially dogs. Hachi is one lovable dog, extremely cute and full of acting ability. But unfortunately he is the best and only good part of the movie. The plot is non-existant with a movie that is so slow with no sense of developing the characters of the movie. Richard Gere does a pretty good job as does his ""daughter"", but his wife never warms up to the dog and we never learn why. Rent the movie, but just do not see why one should purchase it."
1,overrated and dull as heck,"How on Earth did this movie get such high ratings??It's slower than a snail in molasses and nothing major ever even comes of it. This movie is a Lifetime level movie, but I was forced to buy it instead of rent it through Amazon.I wish I could get my $6 and those wasted 90 minutes of my life back, and invest it in watching a can of paint dry instead."
1,dog is loyal and abandoned,"Everyone says this film is about loyalty. Well, the only one who is loyal is the dog. His owner obviously loves him and cares for him. After the owner passes away the family abandons Hachi. Those who make their living at the train station; the hot dog vendor, ticket vendor, etc. say hello, pat the dog, feed him scraps (at least this is what is depicted in the movie) but no one takes him in. This dog was left to live on the street in all kinds of weather for 9 years. The owner was let down by his friends and especially his family who should be ashamed of their disregard for the dog that made him very happy through his life. I may be the only one, but I don't think this movie is about loyalty at all. Quite the opposite"
1,either/or,"my oh my, i usually don't find myself this much in the minority, but this story just didn't work on any level for me. Sentimental stories, more than any other types, really are an either/or, with little room for a lukewarm response. You either buy into it and find the story compelling or you don't and find it a big bore. I'm not enough of an egotist to claim my opinion is worth more than the overwhelming majority, i just want to say here is another dissenting vote."
4,Amazing Story!,"An amazing story off a dog's loyality and devotion to his master.I love movies based on true stories especially true stories about animals.If your a dog lover,you will love this movie.It will definitly pull at your heart strings.Richard Gere was excellent in this movie.Don't pass on this one!"
5,Amazing True Story!,"Not much to say other than the title of this review. This might be ""Hollywoodized"" in parts, but knowing the true story, this was an amazing dog."
5,Heartwarming and great!,This story is what a dog is all about.. a true unconditional loving companion. I'll never tire of watching this movie...
5,One of the few good ones,An outstanding movie! A story of a dog's true devotion to his master. It is one of the few good movies for suitable for all ages.
5,Beautiful Story,"One of the most beautiful, heart-warming, and moving stories that I have ever seen! This made me cry so hard that I have a headache!! The fact that it is based on a true story makes it even more touching! It's very sad and heart-breaking and it's almost guaranteed that anyone not made of stone will cry in this movie. There are some animal movies that are sad and make you leave upset and thinking what the point of sitting through that was. However, this is not the case in this movie. Although it is tragic, it touches your heart and it really shows you the power of love and loyalty. It's a story of transcending love that will move your soul. Also, it will make you want an Akita dog!"
5,Hachi,Very underrated movie -- beautiful story produced and filmed incredibly well -- magnificent acting by Richard Gere -- clearly five stars!
4,what a surprise,"I read about this movie on ""Movieguide"" (a Christian movie review site) and it truly piqued my interest....I had never even remembered this movie being advertised when it was first released!The story is excellent (and a spin-off of the actual ""true"" story, that really happened many years ago in Japan)...what surprised me were the interviews with Richard Gere on making the movie, and his working with the dog trainers to make the story as real as possible, I found those interviews and stories fascinating.If this movie has piqued your interest as it did mine, you will NOT be disappointed in making this purchase. I am looking forward to watching it again with my college-age daughter, (another dog lover) when she comes home this summer."
5,"Excellent, heart moving, and a true story.",Very well done and its power caught me by surprise. There is so much good in animals (dogs) and we can learn a great deal from them.
5,a heart-felt movie,"OMG! when I saw the trailer of the movie, I already cried. So basically, I was crying the whole time while watching the movie. If you have a dog, you better watch this film because it's something you can relate to. It's a great movie!"
4,Met my expectations.,"Good acting from Richard Here and Joan Allen. Hatchi, A Dog's Tale met with my expectations.For me personally, better than ""where the red fern grows."""
3,TEAR-JERKER!!,"If you ever wondered about your beloved pets remembering you throughout their lives, this movie has answered that question. True Love and Loyalty abound in this flick! Get the tissues ready, People."
5,"Well, we cried over this one!!!",Excellent movie. We have mailed it to our great grand daughters in Indiana and they enjoyed it as well. Thank you
5,Heartbreaking,"Many of the reviewers call this movie heartwarming. On the contrary, this movie is very heartbreaking and sad. I watched this movie about a year ago and I still get choked up just thinking about it. Haichi will leave you sad for days. I gave this movie 5 stars because I am an animal lover and this dog was fantastic. I could not watch the movie again because I would turn into mush. You will fall in love with the dog but be warned, you will cry."
5,Hachi: a Dogs Tale,"A heartwarming story to begin with, followed by superb acting, particularily the dog playing Hachi. I would recommend this movie to all ages. Possibly a huge moral to the story--that of love, devotion and never giving up!"
5,Truly Heartwarming story,I have a little dog and I love dogs. This true story is beautifully told and acted and the magnificent dog who played Hachi was exquisitely trained. This is such a moving story and I would recommend this movie to all dog lovers. This film makes you realize how much a dog truly loves their master.
3,Not as touching as I thought it would be,I dunno if I was just super emotional when I saw the trailer for this.... but I cried just watching the trailer lmao.I thought this was going to be an emotional roller coaster but it was sort of bland. It's a beautifully touching true story but I feel like it as just mssing something. They didn't develop the dog's personality like they could have I feel. He sort of just came off as a normal dog... a lug that ppl sort of resented... but not in the cute way like Chance from Homeward Bound... this was in the sort of dog lacking some personality way. I dunno. Just my thoughts. Very cute film. But I didn't bawl like I was hoping to.
3,I havent seen it yet.,"I thought it was a childrens movie, but for I can see it is not.Havent had time to see it yet, but its probably o.k. I bought it for my grandson but I dont thinkhe will like it just yet."
2,If you enjoy unimaginable loss and tragedy...,"This movie starts out sad and only gets worse. Death of people, death of dogs, homelessness, neglect... you got it! If you enjoy choking heart ache and sobbing and movies that will ruin you for at least a week, Hachi is for you. Don't be fooled by the healthy pet and smiling actors on the cover. All will have masks of misery on about fifteen minutes in until this movie mercifully ends at last. It's the Terms of Endearment for dog movies, only without the humor and with a happy ending. Oh, that's right, there wasn't one."
5,"Hachi, a dog's tale","I had seen ""Hachi, A dog's tale"" through Netflix. I so enjoyed it, I purchased a couple DVDs to give as gifts to other dog lovers."
5,Great movie for the whole family,Ordered this movie for family movie night. It was fantastic- a movie story with great actors & actresses. My kids range in age from 5-11 yrs old and they all enjoyed this movie. Does deal with the death of the owner at the end so be prepared with the tissue box but all of mine can't wait to watch it again. I highly recommend for families of all ages.
5,Hachi,This movie was awesome and I would recommend it to anyone. A real tear jerker. I also love Richard Gere. He did a great job.
4,"Overall, a great story!","This is a heart warming and yet heart wrentching movie. I cried through the last 25 min. It is a great story about true loyalty, but very sad towards the end. Caution, there are a few scenes of social drinking, and it tends to lead to the idea that everyone goes to heaven, or at least to an eternal existence as wandering spirits. It also shows how ""people like to take credit for things they had nothing to do with"" once someone is gone from this life."
5,Hachi: A Dog's Tale,I have never seen such a movie so moving and I balled my eyes out! I am the greatest dog lover ever along with many others I'm sure. Wonderful movie but a tear jerky.
5,Very Sweet Movie,"This is an adorable movie, wonderful for the whole family. But be warned; you will inevitably need a boxful of tissues. It was so refreshing to find a heart-warming movie that was totally clean and appropriate for a family setting. Besides, who doesn't love Richard Gere? I gave several DVD's for Christmas presents."
1,Know what you are getting into,A horrible sad movie. This is a thousand times more sad than old yeller. Made my cousin's 6 year old cry and cry.
1,Sad kind of sad,"These people put a horrible American spin on a sad, but true, Japanese story. I bought the film, but I will never loan it out to anyone. I might just break the DVDs, so no one can watch it. Although I'd rather not hear a sad animal story, I can withstand them. But this was a sad story made into awful. It had me upset for days."
1,This is a Movie So Bad Our Family Still Talks About It,This is one of those movies so incredibly bad that whenever my wife talks about watching a movie the kids remind her she picked out this one and she should not be allowed to choose any more movies. The kids don't yet get the nuances of bad acting but they certainly recognize a horrible movie when they see one. I don't know what people are thinking who rate this more than one star. Maybe they feel bad for the people who made this and think they deserve our pity. I pity the people who wasted their time watching this. Don't be one of them.
5,Hacgu,"I have watch this CD many times. I love it. I cry, and think itis so wonderful that Hachi was picked up and taken home. What alesson for all of us. I love dogs or animal movies.To know thatit is a real stories. Many of us have had a wonderful dog,butHachi was special. Thanks for the CD."
5,Love This Movie,I ordered this move for gifts. I have this movie and wanted to share the store with my friends of this amazing dog.Anyone who watches it will be touched. This a must have movie.
5,"Beautiful, Moving, Spiritual Winner, but kind of sad","This is one of the best movies I have seen in many years. I bought this after seeing the movie on TV b/c I loved it so much. I watched it again as soon as I received it and cried again. It is heartwarming and despite the simple story very complex in terms of the emotions it brings out. It is a great story of tremendous love and loyalty - although it is sad mainly b/c the other humans in Hachi's life aren't very loyal to him despite his loyalty. But, there is also a deeply spiritual message - especially the way it ends.It is simply a great movie - the kind that affects you for a long time. I highly recommend this. And if you are a dog or animal lover add a star. If you aren't, you will be by the end of this movie. The fact that is based on a true story only makes it even better.My two cents,Henry"
4,HACHI,"MY FAMILY AND I ENJOYED THIS MOVIE. VERY TOUCHING, MAKE SURE YOU HAVE A BOX OF KLEENEX HANDY. THIS MOVIE NOT AS DETAILED AS THE JAPANESE VERSION BUT, STILL ENJOYABLE. IF YOU LIKE THIS STORY, TRY AND GET A HOLD OF THE JAPANESE MOVIE. RON"
1,Sweet and Touching,I've seen this movie several times and I love it. Hachi is an amazing dog. I ordered this dvd for my son who had a doglike this. I know he and his wife will enjoy it.
5,Loved it,Best movie ever!!! Is sad but impressive!! The actors were well chosen! A movie that must be seen...enjoy!Awesome awesome awesome
5,loved this movie before & love it now!,"i would tell anyone, this is one of the best movies for family & dog lovers since (old yeller}! ."
4,A fantastic find,I can't remember how I stumbled onto this but I'm glad I did. This is a fantastic album from beginning to end. For fans of Explosions In The Sky.
1,wrong item in every way!,The picture shown is not what is actually sent to you. I basically tied up $90 in funds so I could get the wrong thing and return it. The people sending this item are aware that you will receive an item different than pictured but have not managed to change the picture or description. It is DEFINITELY not a direct fit anything. I am extremely annoyed with the whole transaction and hope that for future buyers they know better than to buy this and get the wrong item.
1,Not what was ordered.,"The converter I received was not the one I ordered and it doesn't fit on my (vehicle as it should).The specifications say the length is 23.9"" while the one I received was just 16""."
1,The worst X-Men story I have read since Bishop showed up,"Boring, derivative, Uninspired, stupid and worst of all childish. Go buy the Essential X-Men with the Paul Smith and John Romita Jr. art work with Claremont writing. If Claremont was dead he would be turning over in his grave. Extremely disproportional art. What has happenedd to the Kuberts, they draw like Liefeld now. Whats even sadde is that the Kuberts teach at the Joe Kubert school now."
2,Review of Kindle version,"An entertaining book, marred by some formatting problems. There are multiple instances of strikeovers from the editing process that have left in the book. There are left-hand margin problems, also. The book was apparently taken from the British version, as it uses single-quotes all the way through (very distracting). It doesn't look as though anyone proofed this work as an ebook.This is the fourth (?) volume of the adventures of Lee Olmstead, golf pro. I've enjoyed them all. I'm knock off one star for formatting issues that should have been caught."
4,Ripoff,I think that twelve dollars for the shipping and handling for one book is excessive. Book was an excellant price but the shipping and handling charges were a ripoff. I won't use this business again.
2,Not what I was hoping for,I was hoping for a book to assist in writing a good toast. This book simply offered toasts for use. Not exactly what I was looking for to assist me in creating toasts for two very special occasions. Could be useful if you are looking for something quick and impersonal.
5,The book on Ferromagnetics,"As an MSEE working as an assistant professor at a university, it is vital to be able to anwser a broad range of questions. These questions beeing your own or your students. This requires that you have ascess to a wide range of text-books. I have found Chikazumi's book very usefull as a reference, AND it is written in the SI-system of units!"
2,Wish it worked better,"Great idea...it just doesn't work for my nails.Does not clip unless perfectly placed.If not placed just right, nail is simply bent...ouch!!!Sorry!!"
1,Not for fingernails,I bought this product because I have difficulty holding on to the usual style of fingernail clipper. I thought these would be ideal; the picture showed them being used on a woman's fingernails. BUT the cutting blades are so thick that I couldn't get them under my nails and they removed parts of my fingertips instead. These might work better as toenail clippers but I use nail scissors for that task. I'll put these in the Chinese auction at my reunion. I gave one star because they are easy to hold.
3,"Has great leverage, but","These clippers have great leverage for us with arthritic fingers, but the plastic guard around the cutters makes application awkward and slightly hazardous. So, I had to break the guards off to get proper results with trimming."
2,Disappointed,"The large handle and the angle of the blade are great but the blades don't line up with each other so instead of cutting the nails they just break them off. I had put this item on my Amazon "" wish list"" and received it as a gift. Now I'm not sure how to go about returning it without causing a lot of hassle for the gift giver."
1,nothing like advertised,"It turned out to be nothing like described. The jaws do NOT open wide enough to handle thick long nails. There was no sharp clipping. My nails were completely mangled...shredded, ruining several pairs of socks. The grip is comfortable, but what good is that if it doesn't perform to specifications?"
1,cannot cut toe nails with this nail clipper,"this is an impossible item to cut toe nails with.the opening does not accommodate the thickness of all toe nails, and it does not make a clean cutwhen you can actually use it.you have to really exert pressure and hope it will cut the toe nail off,but many times it does not.this nail clipper went into the trash, cannot recommend it at all."
1,denco easy grip nail clipper,"These did not perform as promised. They were not exactly easy to use, they did not provide an accurate cut, they were less useful than the old-type clippers (which is what I was hoping to get away from). I believe it was a waste of money."
2,A let down,"Story was really short, lacking a lot of content. The illustrations were interesting but the actual story was lacking, in my opinion. So far I have only enjoyed Lenore by Dirge and have not been a big fan of his other works."
5,WE ALL FEEL...,"BEING A ROMAN DIRGE FAN FROM WORD ONE, I HAVE A FEELING THAT EVERYONE SHOULD READ THIS BOOK. GUARANTEED, WE ALL HAVE FELT THIS WAY AT ONE TIME OR ANOTHER. IF NOT, YOU'RE EITHER VERY LUCKY OR IN DEEP DENIAL... ENJOY."
5,A wonderfull book!,"This delightful book gives a wonderful glimpse into the Mexican culture of fireworks, as seen by a little girl whose family are deeply involved in that culture. As a fireworks professional, I appreciated this warm and sympathetic view of fireworks. When people ask why I am involved in fireworks, I get out this book and show them the picture on the cover. Fireworks is the only way I know to put that expression of joy and awe onto the faces of children. A truly wonderful book, which captures that wonder."
2,Code isn't easy to follow,"In the opening chapters, it is difficult to see what code is generated and what code needs to be written. After trying to use this book for a few hours, I turned to the Client/Server Programming with Java and Corba book by Orfali and Harkey and quickly was up and running. The Vogel book just isn't as clear."
1,Obsolete,This book refers to obsolete technology. It was published in 1997. Much has changed after that. Get the third edition.
2,Not good for teaching,"This book is good for the expert or people who are faimiliar with the CORBA. Altough the authors are the professional programmer, they need to pratice how to teach the audiences. If you go to the Java web site, they will describe you step by step. This book is not a good programming. It is only the theoritical book."
