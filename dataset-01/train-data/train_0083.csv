4,Great cream and nice scent!,"I have combination type of skin and my face gets really dry during winter time, so I need rich cream for the winter. A friend of mine got this lavender cream for me from Japan and it worked so well that I was convinced that it was the lavender that did the wonder to my skin. After finishing that cream, I started looking for other lavender products on Amazon and found this one which fit my budget at the time. I remember the first time when I applied it to my skin, there was a tiny bit of ""burning"" feel but it went away very quickly. Throughout the winter, I used it every day. It kept my face moisturized for the entire day and it also didn't feel too thick or anything. I was hoping for some more improvements on my complexion but frankly speaking I was sleep deprived most of the time during the usage of this cream, so I really shouldn't blame the cream. I will consider purchasing it again for this coming winter."
3,Its okay.,"I like the fact that it is light, not oily. It goes on smooth as i use it under my make up. I also like that the ingredients are natural and does not contain parabens. The only downside is that while the smell of lavender is wonderful, the scent of this cream is so so strong. After a while u get used to it but the first few times its very overwhelming to the senses. So be prepared for that if you get it."
5,High quality and divine.,"This cream is exceptionally high quality for a comparatively low price. The lavender oil in it its extremely therapeutic, and has a divine scent, which is also relaxing. I found that it is very soothing for sensitive skin, like mine, since I am sometimes allergic to face cream ingredients. Lavender oil not only has a gorgeous scent, but, helps skin heal. I absolutely love this product, and the very reasonable price makes it a win-win."
3,Too oily,Overall it's a gentle and hydrated night cream and I like about its natural ingredients; but its way too oily than all of my other moisturizers. I think it's good for dry skin but not for combination/oily skin. Now I use it as my night hand cream:)
3,Formla is changed,"I'm a little disappointed because the formula has changed. It is now called lavender ""Luminosity"" night cream. It has a sticker that says ""NEW more sustainable"" on the box. I don't know if the product has become better or worse, because it's my first time buying it. I specifically bought this product due to its near 5 star reviews, so I'm sad that I don't get to try out the original product everyone was raving about. As for this new formula, the scent is mildly pleasing, and it moisturizes my skin well. Takes a while to sink in. Lavender might burn your skin a little at first. I wish the formula didn't change. It's unwise for any company to change a perfect product that's loved so much. Chances are high they will not make it better, but worse."
1,Disappointed,This recording did not sound authentic. It sounded like the Mormon Tabernacle Choir singing Sufi chants. This is not what I expected and I am not likely to purchase another recording by this group (On Wings Of Song).
1,What the f?,"I'm appauled at the person who approved this screenplay. He probably thought they could capitalize off the success of Barbershop.I didn't laugh at anyone really. I thought Alicia Silverstone was awful. She wasn't her usual jovial self. Queen Latifah's role as the strong black woman who thinks white people are crazy is getting old. The rest of the cast seemed to try to parallel Barbershop's cast. I saw one woman trying to be the old wise person(Cedric the Entertainer), but she couldn't pull it off because she just came off as ignorant and annoying. For the most part, the hair masters did their best to live up to the stereotypes we all have in our minds. It wasn't outrageous.Skip this movie."
2,"It stunk on ice! (but, not quite)","(The title of my review (minus the stuff in parenthesis) is something I heard on a nickelodeon show called Rocket Power) Anyway, the only things I liked about this movie were the black women (and the white women trying to fit in) and the jokes about Queen Latifa's butt. (Also it had a person from a show I like called Faerie Tale Theatre, but i didn't know which character it was.) It was boring and I didn't understand alot of it. Only take teenagers to this movie."
2,Six degrees?,The raison d'etre for this movie must have been to give fans of the Kevin Bacon game an easy way to connect actors. Why else would so many name actors appear in this formulaic fluff? It is not as bad as Barbershop but not much better.Watchable if you have absolutely nothing else to do. Or for the very amusing performance of KB as Jorge.
4,Great Family Movie,"Queen Latifah puts her all into anything she does. She really shined in this production, as well as all of the other cast.I could not get into Kevin Bacon in this type movie, But I got a lot of chuckles from this movie .The movie was good and the actors were superb, but I wish that the parts were stronger.The movie was predictable."
5,Beauty Shop,"Fabulous movie, which is so similar to myself and my friends, movie came to me in a timely fashion and was in excellent shape, I would highly recommend this company for future purchases."
5,Beauty Shop DVD,They were very quick sending the package....it was not damage cover nor DVD. Will use them again.
4,I love this type of comedy,"I really really liked this movie. QL is great again, and there is an interesting mix of actors in it. Everyone from Golden Brookes to Kevin Bacon to Alicia. It's funny and entertaining, but admitedly it does lack something. If you watch this without overly analysing it, you'll enjoy it and have fun. It is worth taking a look at."
3,1/2 & 1/2 + Stars we know & love,"It's a nice film with a decent villian played by Kevin Bacon. One of the reasons I liked this movie is because of Queen Latifah & Keshia Knight Pulliam (mostly because like most people I grew with her on The Cosby Show). I'm not at all too thrilled with the racial talk either or the slang. I'm definetly not happy with that little boy. Now you should see the ending, it was clever, and it had to do with one of the customers. Overall, not a bad film. I only wished it did more."
3,Charmingly funny,"This is cute and funny. Kevin Bacon's character ""Jorge"" was different for him but very amusing which you enjoyed hating. This isn't ""The Queen's"" best or funniest, but is still entertaining and worth watching. Queen Latifah plays a beautician that gets discouaged working for Jorge (Bacon) follows her dream and opens up her own salon. There are many other entertaining characters in this film which makes for good fun watching."
1,racist movie,What is the deal with the black women in this movie being so cool and the one white woman being an idiot? If there was a movie like this with all white women and one black woman as an idiot then everyone would scream RACISM!
1,I wish I could give it a zero,"A friend of mine loaned me this movie and to be honest, it has made me question his character. The preceding rave reviews of how great this movie is proves unequivocally that Black people are always going to be on the bottom in America. Our minds are not right. This movie is silly, mindless, poorly written and filled with even more Black caricatures. There is a faction of Blacks working against the mental advancement of the group and they are doing a hell of a job."
2,A Definite Hair Don't,"Wait for the DVD; this is OK. It's not good, but it's not horrible. Queen Latifah is great, but even she can't carry this predictable fare."
1,Queen Latifa deserves better than this,"This ""movie"" gave me headache. So predictable and formula-matic. Queen Latifa has so much talent I hope she gets better scripts. My kingdom for a good movie!"
3,Beauty Shop with a Message,I enjoyed the message of this movie. Never give up your dreams no matter how hard the struggle. Queen Latifah plays Gina who dares to strike out on her own. After being dissed by the very funny Kevin Bacon. The different persons working at the shop. the standouts were Golden Brooks and Alicia Sliverstone. It was good not great but nevertheless if you are a Queen Latifah fan you will enjoy this movie.
2,Bad hair day,"Definitely a split decision with the wife, who loved it...I'm not sure what it was that turned my stomach -- the crude (and constant) sexual commentary, the racial stereotypes and overt racism, the preoccupation with rear ends, the lame acting or the predictable and formulaic script and character development. Maybe it was just a bad batch of popcorn. Whatever it was, by the time I left the theater I had literally lost my appetite.The best that can be said of this unintentional disaster movie is that Queen Latifah kept her dignity in the rubble."
1,Disappointing device,"I bought this item so I could quickly digitize my slides. Not in the best possible quality but fair enough for a catalog. The first and biggest problem appeared to be that only automatically framed slides thinner than 2.5mm fitted into the frame-holder. 99% of my slides are manually framed (by myself)and didn't fit in. The test I did with the other 1% was disappointing. My Nikon D3100 does not focus well on the surface of the frame. I should focus manually, which is very difficult on such a small picture. The last thing is: the slide uses only a small portion of the image with my 19-35mm lense. That's a waist of pixels."
1,clumsy to use.,"While the concept seems good, it just will not produce a good duplicate picture no matter what lens I used and I have many. It is also clumsy to use, it does not lock in one position adequately. When you think you have it set, and then try to move the slide carrier to the next slide, the device moves resulting is loss of the rotational setting. I have hundred's of slides and this device will take way to long to get them all digitized."
2,Slide copier,"I am disappointed in the quality of the copies of my slides. Hopefully as I get use to using this unit, I will get better. But now not very happyJames"
1,A piece of junk,"It is a slide copier, you cannot put regular film in it. It is very heavy and the parts move, very difficult to center the image. A waste of money."
1,Bad design,"This device has a very limited use.They say it's suitable for 67 or 52mm thread lenses, and it's true.But what they don't tell you is that you need about a 70mm focal lens to get the rectangle of the slide in a decent view size.I have a tokina 50mm lens (52mm thread) and what I got is a very small image of the slide, about 1/3 of the whole camera view. Not to mention a lot of ligth comming from the edges of the slide.So, now I have 2 choices: To buy any lens with longer focal distance or to do a huge digital crop of each picture I get from this ""copier"" (having a loss of quality, of course).Opteka could build a better desing (maybe a set of threaded rings that allow the user to choose the right tube lenght, instead of a sinle pipe). But at least, they must warn the customer about the focal lenght needed for this copier to work properly."
2,I suppose OK,Very hard to find adapters that would fit my 18-200 lenses (Nikon and Tameron and using it on the 18-55 did not produce the expected result (think black frame around the slides). Expected a better made product
3,Good Inexpensive Slide Copier,"This is a good slide copier for the money. You will get better results if you want to pony up a few hundred dollars for a professional side and negative scanner. I found it a bit laborious to insert each slide, then refocus my camera for each one. I wouldn't want to tackle the job of copying a few hundred slides with it, but if you have a couple of dozen at a time to copy, then it will work fine. I thought the overall quality of the copies wasn't bad. I used a Nikon D40X with the 18-55mm lens."
2,hard to use,Very hard to use. Single slide hard to push in and pull out. Did not fit properly over lens on camera body. Needs a light box for proper illumination of slides.
1,Slide copier,Not quite as simple to use as I expected and it doesn't work as well as I had hoped. I can't recommend this product.
1,Tentative review,"I don't know what to make of the Opteka Digital Duplicator. I am trying to use it on my Nikon D60 DSLR. I have a 55-200 mm zoom lens and an 18-55 mm. I have been trying to get a decently focused image, but, try as I may, I get a blurred image using either lens. I write this hoping somebody will tell me what I need to do."
4,Works well for the money,"For the money, you can't beat the Opteka slide copier. It worked as advertised. I copied several slides made back in the 1960's from a 110 film camera. While the slide frames fit in the copier, the opening wasn't large enough to get the entire image top to bottom. If the detail I wanted was on the very top of the slide, I inserted it into the copier upside down and vise versa. However, slides produced from 35mm film fit perfectly. I used a Nikon 35-105 macro lens in macro mode on a Nikon D3. Had to manually focus, but it worked fine. I only used that lens because it was the only lens with 52mm filter size. Bottom line, for the money this did the job. It was much quicker than a slide scanner."
2,There are some problems,"The Opteka HD2 Slide duplicator has two problems.1. Some old paper mounted Kodak slides are slightly too large and must be forced into the slide slot. Pliars must be used to remove them.2. The slide is not in correct alignment and cannot be pushed down far enough to fill the viewfinder, leaving a black band across the bottom of the frame. Thus one must either zoom in slightly to fill the frame thereby loosing part of the picture, or crop out the black bar afterwards using a photo editor.If I bought another slide copier, it would be the model with the movable slide receiver."
4,Useful tool,"There is some assembly and experimentation required: I find that shooting a nef (raw) file and adjusting the color makes old slides come back to life. It's way better than the scanners I've tried, but probably not the same as a dedicated slide scanner. If you have a high resolution digital camera, it's a good and inexpensive add-on."
3,Vietnam in Russian,Take all the American war movies about Vietnam with the standard characters and have them become Russian paratroopers in Afghanistan and have it made by a Russian film commpany and you have 9th Company. Not as good as the Boys in Company C but a little closer to the Siege of Firebase Gloria. However it still a pretty good war movie. Given our present involvment in Afghanistan the briefing given by the Russian intelligence officer was pretty good.
2,Who did da dub?,"Transfer is OK, although colors are a little 'washed out' (maybe a conscious decision by the director.) English audio dub is a real hack job, with horrible lip sinc and dialogue that was definitely 'lost in translation'. Even with the horrible dialogue, the film has some very good action sequences and some pretty good acting. Definitely rent this one unless you are a combat junkie and speak fluent Russian, then it might be a buy."
4,The Other Side of the Mountain,"Based on true story, this tale takes the viewer through a coming-of-age oddyssey of young Soviet soldiers, conscripted into service during the final years of the war in Afghanistan. Terse training sequences, the pronounced effects of post-traumatic stress disorder in veterans, and social unrest characterize their preparation for combat. Once in country as elite air assault troops, they experience the grim realism and sometimes counter-intuitive behavior of the ""muj"" or Mujahadeen tribesmen, who prove to be an extraordinarily adept foe. After the pivotal battle atop a remote outpost, only one soldier remains alive and is rescued by Soviet forces withdrawing as the war ends. The viewer is left with a feeling of hopelessness and the absurdity of war--not to mention the irreversible damage this particular conflict had on the USSR."
5,Good war movie,"Lots of action, good effects, a good look at Soviet small arms of 1980's. The chick was hot and sort tossed into things to make it a real guy movie. It worked. I wish I understood Russian now. I watched it minus the English dubbing that was not done well and had do do with subtitles, but not a big deal."
3,VDV in Action in the Khost-Gardez pass,"The film is loosely based on the 9th Company/345th Independent Guards Airborne Regiment. After training, arrival in Afghanistan, etc. they are assigned the mission to hold Hill 3234 during Operation Magistral, largest effort of the Soviet Afghan War. This is a Russian film, and American audiences often have trouble with them. What helped me is the historical importance of the fight for Hill 3234, which I have been to (a plaque is now there for 9th Company), a longterm interest in the Soviet Airborne Forces and Spetsnaz, and having some close Ukrainian friends - all of them former VDV or Spetz - who love this film.I don't care in the least that the lip sync is not great, or that the plot is a little sappy from time to time, or that no one from the Hollywood A list is in it. To me it's worth the price."
3,Chaos in the 9th Company,Havbing worked for the US Army for forty years my review concerns the lack of disapline in the Russian Army. The company seemed to be in constant confusion and in the final attack they seemed lost on what to do.
3,Interesting Russian Filmaking,"Its interestign to see the war in afghanistan from the russian perspective. Not that well made, but the intend is there. I enjoyed it but I think all the great shots are in the trailers."
3,Godzilla like over acting and dubbing,"Pretty lame, unbelievable action and segues. The standing full frontal assault by the muj at the end must be a director's statement of something I missed. Newer Godzilla flicks are better. Amazing scenery."
1,How the 9th Company is understood in Russia,"This film is not based on real events, it's based on Bondarchuck Jr's impressions of what was real. Significant portion of movie budget was spent on advertising and TV buzz, without which this movie would be a financial disaster. As a result, the movie is not well appreciated in Russia.Many scenes in the movie are objectionable, and have little relation to how it was in real 9th company story. Several survivors from that battle were really disappointed and refused to acknowledge movie similarity to real events.The main issue is that they knew that they were not forgotten, and help was on it's way, and the fierce fight was not futile. Every other lie in the film is simply eclipsed by this fact.You should know this when watching 'The 9th Company'."
2,poorly produced,"film made with good intentions but is very poorly put together. Very choppy dialouge synching in english, subtitles hard to follow. Acting was at best mediocre. This DVD is better rented than puchased."
4,Russian in Afganistan,Not bad for a Russian movie. No subtitles but the enlish paste over help and done well. Shows the problems of the Russian Army of the 1980s and the personal feelings of the soldiers in the 9th Company. Good movie if you like action.
2,I should have bought the subtitled version,"This movie is great, it really is but unless you REALLY need to here english and don't like to read, get the subtitled version. The english voice acting makes this movie extremely difficult to watch. Imagine trying to watch Full Metal Jacket in Vietnamese..."
2,Amateur war film,"I just rented this movie last night and I was very disappoint. The pacing was very slow, it took more than an hour for the main characters to finally make into Afghanistan. Unlike Full Metal Jacket, however, there wasn't a whole lot of character developing, just a bunch of random events. There were couple of good moments but it wasn't enough to overcome the bad. People who think the battle scenes are realistic needs to watch more modern war films like Band of Brothers and Flags of our fathers. The battle scenes felt very amateurish, the Mujaheddins attack at walking pace like they are strolling at the park, and the characters likes to shoot wildly in the open without cover and bunch up together. I was going to add this to my collection but I think I'll skip it."
1,Worse than The Hurt Locker,"This movie is absolute garbage. I just finished it and am pissed I spent money on it for the Blu-Ray version, when I would have been mad I spend a dollar on it at redbox. I have never studied Russian military history but am sure that they are more disciplined than the ""soldiers"" portrayed in the movie. It makes me think that if we went to war with the Soviet Union we wouldn't have had that hard of a time. I think that this movie is similar to ""The Hurt Locker"" (worst ""war"" movie ever) in that someone (who must have never served in the military) tries to portray to the general public what war is about and goes on searching for a deeper meaning to war and doesn't ever come close to finding it. I know that this movie and The Hurt Locker are movies, but the technical inaccuracies in them are absolutely terrible. You may enjoy it if you have never been in the military, however if you have ever served I am telling you that you will be disappointed."
1,No quality control,"I tried to play this on two of my DVD players, plus two of my computers, plus I took it to work and several of my co-workers tried to play it AND NO ONE COULD! So much for Amazon quality control (or who-ever is responsible for selling this piece of garbage). We used it for a frizbee until it broke."
5,HIM STRONGEST STAND,this is him's heaviest song and it is brilliant!but not for those new to him because this is an alternative!
5,Rocks in His Head,"This is an excellent book for teachers of 3rd and 4th graders to use as a supplement to teaching a science unit on rocks. It introduces some of the scientific terms used to assist with the content of the unit. A good lesson is also taught about how a hobby/passion can lead to unimaginable heights, even in difficult times."
1,Don't make em like they used to.,"I had a Schrade Barlow for 40 years. It was my father's before that. So I don't know how old it was. It my husband's favorite picnic knife, but we lost it. These Made in China knives look pretty much the same, but the spring action is disappointing and the thumb groove not deep enough. I'm now looking for an old knife."
4,A great book!,"I recently finished reading this book, and really enjoyed it. If you enjoyed the movie (or maybe even if you didn't) and are interested in ""behind the scenes"" information about it, I'd definitely recommend getting this book. It has lots of great pictures, and it's interesting reading, too."
1,Hed the warnings,"I don't do many reviews but I have to put in my 2c on this item so here I go, the quality is soo poor its un-watchable. I've seen clips of this movie on youtube that sparked my interest but these dvds that come from SINISTERCINEMA are of the Worst quality and almost killed my interest until I learned that the original films (the tiger of eschnapur+the indian tomb) were remastered into ""Fritz Langs INDIAN EPIC"". Google it and you will find it, its out of print but you can order it or find it on ebay as I did.Again a good movie from 1959 that you should have in your collection but not this one.Oh yes I forgot to mention that this dvd ""the journey to the lost city"" has almost all of dance seens cut out."
4,Pretty good movie.,If you like Debra Paget you will like this movie. She also played in the Ten Commandaments. I didn't know she wasa dancer. In this movie she does a great dance performance.
4,Easy read,Easy read that had some interesting parts about life in the bush. Fun to read the chronicles of daily life!
3,Unclear book,Not my favorite arthritis book. Too scattered in its approach. I was left confused and a little overwhelmed...but to be fair there is also a lot of very good information to be found within the pages...
1,The Users- not as advertised,"This product was not as advertised. It was advertised as between ""very good""and 'like new', and in ""excellent"" category.There was some picture static through out tape which tracking did not fix, and some sound static at beginning and end.The tape was not even re-wound, it was stopped in middle of tape. I did watch it twice, and then donated it to the thrift store.I will purchase a better tape for my collection elsewhere, but will not deal with ""Movie Basket"" again."
3,I do not think their like will be seen again....,"I'm with Micheal - had to wade through it at school in Irish. I don't feel any need to revisit the experience in later life. It is the template for Angela's Ashes, and all the other epics of Irish victimhood. If you want to explore the themes and not feel like slitting your wrists at the end of it, read Flann O'Brien's ""The Poor Mouth"". He piles on the misery, and takes a pot-shot at all of them in a side-splitting parody. And this was also originally written in Irish, so he knows what he's talking about.The Poor Mouth: A Bad Story About the Hard Life (Irish Literature Series)"
2,THis cd is not good.,"I guess this cd is made from some underground rappers of Wu tang. I thought I was goin to like this cd cuz I am a Wu Tang Clan fan. I do not like this cd and I will be taking it to Hastings to get some money back from it. Don't get this cd, its junk."
3,Third One Is Alright,"I liked the first and second books quite a bit. This one was OK. They seem to be getting a little sensational though and off the track of normal everyday life. I just wished Hardy wasn't always putting in jabs at white people, like we are all an enemy or to be suspect or guilty of every problem relating to blacks. He sounds like a man that detests whites."
3,PAT ON THE BACK TO MITCHELL,I ENJOYED READING THIS BOOK BECAUSE IT BROUGHT BACK MEMORIES OF MY FIRST LOVE OR SHALL I SAY LUST. I REALLY THINK MITCH'S RELATIONSHIP WITH RAHEEM IS ADOREABLE AND HOPE THAT BLACK BROTHERS OUT THERE TAKE FROM THIS STORY THAT YOUR PAST RELATIONSHIPS ARE ONLY IN THE PAST AND THAT IT IS USUALLY BETTER TO CONCENTRATE ON YOURSELF AND WHAT YOU WANT OUT OF LIFE BEFORE TRYING AN ATTEMPT AT A LONG TERM RELATIONSHIP.
3,NOTHING COMPARED TO B-BOY BLUES,""" B-BOY"" WAS SO HOT IT SCORCHED MY FINGERTIP &. SO FUNNY I BUSTED MY GUT. THE CHARACTERS WERE SO REAL, I FELL IN LOVE WITH THEM ALL. EXPECTING THIS STANDARD, I TURNED EACH PAGE OF ""IF ONLY FOR ONE NITE"" IN LIMP DISAPPOINTMENT. THE STORY WAS RUSHED, CHARACTERS SKETCHED, THE HUMOR MINIMAL, AND THE SEX WAS TEPID. I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE SEEN MITCHELL TESTIFY AT W.A.R.'S TRIAL. MAYBE THAT'S THE NEXT NOVEL."
1,It should be less than one star,"This book is more than erratic. Some awful books are at least readable, but that can't be said of this book. Mr. Hardy is a better writer than this, but unfortunately you wouldn't know it by this book. How anyone in good conscience could publish this book is truly beyond me. I truly felt like throwing this book away, or writing the publisher for a refund."
1,Broderbund stonewall,Product may be OK but I will never know. Could not get it function although it installed perfectly. Broderbund is immpossible to contact if you have a problem. Their software support (Encore) does not have an 800 number and you can hang on long distance for an hour before talking to someone.Frustrated and waste of time due to Broderbund lousy support.A. Adams
1,Louisiana Residents beware,If you live in the state of Louisiana don't buy this product you can not use any of the forms. You will not find that out until you purchase the product.
5,Perfect transaction,"I knew when I bought this that it was an older version, but it works great with Windows 2000 and Vista. It is a little tricky to load your existing files but they are in there when you find the way to load them. What you do is double click the category of the document from the list on the left, then your saved document will pop up. Software came in a factory sealed box and you can't beat it for the price."
5,"Great CD, but Andrew's gone...","Time 2 Go is a great mix of music providing something for everyone's listening tastes. But we must remember that this CD was made WITH ANDREW FRANCA!!! The driving bass that is heard thru-out the CD and keeps the music rockin' is ANDREW, not Steve. One has to wonder why, with such great new material, the band hasn't been playing nearly as many venues as in the past, when ANDREW was part of the band. Hmm.....maybe they should rethink what they did. Once an ANDREW fan, always an ANDREW fan.Nuff said."
4,The Start of TA,"Interesting book. A bit technical and outdated, but you will learn about your fellow man. Can get through in a day."
3,A sign of its time,"Boy oh boy! If you are a ""liberated"" man or woman, this book (audio) will remind you, in a hurry, what the femenist movement was fighting. While the information is as valid today as the time it was written, the examples are awful! Berne's use of stereotypes of women and their roles is a real distraction. This book deserves a thorough editing or rewrite to make it palatable enough to reach a more enlightened audience.When buying this audio, the buyer should keep this disgusting defect in mind... and choose something else."
2,Boring and very technical,"I could not finish it, it was confusing and boring. The nice title it has, promises a lot, but underdelivers."
3,"Dealing with Life ""Games""","I read this book many years ago. As an engineering student, then manager, it gave me some people insights I didnt get in college. And it's in more or less laymen terms.Good reading. You'll recognize yourself and maybe that person/persons that are driving you crazy."
2,Games People Play,"Found this a bit boring and technical, I'm afraid. The basic principle is true enough, but the book was in psychologist-speak."
3,"""Brilliant"", but not an easy read","Take my three-star rating with a pinch of salt. There's plenty in Games People Play that's fascinating. Kurt Vonnegut apparently called the book ""brilliant"". But long passages, I confess, sailed over my head. And if sometimes I was inspired, on other occasions this newcomer to psychology was left lost and a little puzzled."
4,Little Froggie,"The seller was very quick with shipping my item to me. My doggie loves the little frog. The squeaker is a little hard to find, so if your dog HAS to have a squeaky toy, this might not be the one. It's in there, but near impossible to get to squeak. Overall, it's a good product and is very durable so far."
5,The Best Grammar for Intermediate Students,"I learned Greek grammar from the golden gems of knowledge by Dana and Mantey. Having already studied Summers and Sawyer, this book by Dana and Mantey proved to be invaluable to describe the nuances of Greek grammar which in turn led to clearer exegesis. Thanks to Dr. Delnay, who was taught by Dr. Mantey, for using this book in second-year Greek class at Clearwater Christian College."
1,Don't touch it,"Dana and Mantey know little about Greek grammar. This is one of the worst grammars available, no matter how easy it is to read it is bad grammar."
2,Not really what I expected,"I knew this was an old book, but the condition was okay. Kind of smelly, very old, like maybe it had been sitting in the garage. This was my first time ordering, so maybe I just didn't know what to expect."
4,"An ""Oldie"" but still a ""Goodie""!","I read this book a long time ago, but recently revisited it.We have to remember that ""Bittersweet Rain"" was first published in 1984 under the name of Erin St. Claire, so the writing and style reflects Sandra's writing of that time period.It is a straight-up romance, and a very good one.Caroline Dawson, the daughter of the town drunk, has always dreamed of living in a house like The Retreat, where the Lancasters live.She is also ""smitten"" with Rink Lancaster, but although he could meet her secretly during their magical summer, she knew he'd never want to be with her in public.She realizes her goal of living at The Retreat... but is it worth losing the only man she's ever loved?"
2,Not very convinving,Characters didn't seem real and the sex invoved is too much like her other novels. Seems formulaic.
4,Very Good Story!,I am always looking for stories that have a bit of a twist and this one does.Good character and plot development. I enjoyed reading it.
4,YOUR FATHER'S WIFE OR YOUR FORGOTTEN LOVE?,"WOW, WHAT A PREDICAMENT. WHAT WOULD YOU DO IF YOU FOUND THE WOMAN YOU ONCE AND STILL LOVED MARRIED TO THE MAN YOU HATE TO CALL YOUR FATHER? RINK'S SOLUTION WOULD BE TO STEAL KISSES HERE AND THERE AND OF COURSE EVENTUALLY BED HER.I DIDNT REALIZE THAT PARENTS COULD HAVE SO MUCH HATRED FOR A CHILD TO DO SOMETHING LIKE WHAT HE DID TO HIS OWN SON. I'M GLAD THE WAY THINGS ENDED UP IN THE END. IT SHOWS THAT REGARDLESS OF WHAT OTHER PEOPLE SAY LOVE OUT WEIGHS IT ALL."
1,Disappointing,"I read all the bad reviews as well as the good ones. I make up my own mind, but this book definitely leaves A LOT to be desired. I like a light 'feel-good' romance. This was neither. I'm 3/4 finished with this book, and the hero and heroine are still lambasting each other. It's disgusting. There's nothing 'feel-good' in this book. It would be as satisfying to read a gory mystery.When I'm finished I will go back to Shadows of Yesterday. That is a 'feel good' romance."
4,"Sandra Brown's Book, Bittersweet Rain, Abounds with Errors.","The story line is strong in my opinion, and the characters are appealing. I read a Kindle version of Bittersweet Rain. I don't know what procedure is followed when a novel is issued in Kindle. However, there were so many typos and gramatical errors that they were a distraction. I found myself counting them up instead of paying attention to the story. In my opinion, Sandra Brown needs to hire a new editor. In 50 years of reading, never have I seen so many errors in one short book."
3,Confused,"The story line was OK but so many of the words on the Kindle edition were mis-spelled that I couldn't enjoy all of it! I've never come across the spelling distraction to this extent before, I don't appreciate the read nearly as much as usual on my Kindle. Am I the only one this has happened to?"
5,I Couldnt Put It Down!,"I bought this book today and I've already finished it. I have read one other title from her and I am now addicted to her work. Her writing flows and has an energy that makes you laugh and cry at the same time. I will now buy anything I can find of hers. If you wanna read a sassy story that has chin dropping romance, read this book!"
3,A Bittersweet Disappointment,"I am a huge fan of Sandra Brown, and I have read almost all of her books. I was a bit disappointed in ""Bittersweet Rain"". The plot itself was a great idea with a lot of potential, but the story did not follow through. The story had a good opening, but then it didn't really go anywhere. The sub-plot of Laura Jane and Steve was more interesting than the hero and heroine. I'm still a big fan of Sandra Brown and on the whole it's a good book, but I've come to expect more from her work."
1,Bittersweet Rain,"Wow, that was terribly hard to read. I had no idea it was going to have so many lame sex scenes. They overtook the story and frankly I completely missed the point. So sorry to have bought it. I dont need a picture painted, I have an imagination."
3,High Cliffs,"I belong to a monthly bookclub with sixteen members. We try to pick books from a list of authors with bestsellers. This is the first that over half of us did not like. I felt it started out with the ""I cannot stop reading"" feeling. I wish Caroline's husband, Roscoe had been introduced before his illness. I think he would of added so much more to the story. Roscoe and Rink had a father/son relationship that the author missed. Why the daughter and caretaker? I feel no point was made. We were all put on a high cliff and left without a parachute. Disappointed club member."
4,"Basic, typical Sandra Brown, which is a good thing!","""Bittersweet Rain"" was another typical SB novel. Not that that is a good thing or a bad thing either way. Rink was gone for twelve long years after breaking Caroline's heart. But things still aren't in the best of shape, due to Roscoe's deteriorating condition. This is the one thing that brings Rink and Caroline together once again. I like these books but they all sound the the same after a while."
5,Bittersweet Rain,Great read! I would recommend this book to anyone of my friends! I look forward to reading all of Sandra Brown's books!
2,Disappointing,"I have been buying this version of radio from Sony for 20 years and loved them. The last version was discontinued and on ebay were over $100 dollars. I bought this one. Sounds great , great design, but has no AM of distance. very disapointing"
1,Product is terrible give it no stars,If you hold it right and press on the outside shell just off center it MIGHT work or not. Worst SONY product I have ever owned. Ans no one accepts -- return it to me to be fixed....I sure will not use Amazon retailers again!!
2,Not for beginners !,This tape is more of a demonstration rather than a teaching program. The music used is rather complicated and the steps are combined into routines rather quickly. If you are quick on your feet and have had exposure to Celtic dance than this tape is for you.
2,Grandchild has enjoyed it,While I was bored to tears watching the video my grandaughter (10) seems to enjoy dancing along to it. Most of the lessons are for adults and complicated but she does seem to have fun.
2,dance instruction for dancers.,"I bought this DVD because of all the celtic dancing DVD reviews I read, this one seemed to be the most accessible. If so, then maybe I'm not cut out for celtic dance. The instruction given seems to be aimed at people who already know how to dance. It's brief, done only once, covers 8-9 moves at a time, and when Dunne lets you try it out, the music is at full tempo. This is pretty frustrating and not made more helpful by his frequent use of ""this very simple step..."" ""the most basic move...""It's a fun DVD, and he's a great dancer. And I'll probably try it again. But if you're looking for an easy 'in' to Celtic Dance, as I was, I'd look somewhere else."
2,NOT for a beginner,"If you want to learn the basics of Irish dance, this is not a good choice. Colin is an extremely gifted dancer and his moves are impressive. However, he flies through the steps far too quickly and you will find yourself hitting rewind over and over and OVER to pick up a step.If you are already familiar with all the basic steps, this could be a good tape to practice along with and enhance what you've learned elsewhere.Incidentally, the quality of the video isn't great - the lighting is poor and it seems more like a home video than a professional recording."
3,"Dancing is inspiring, but instruction is hard to follow","I have both tap and modern jazz experience under my belt, and I still had a very hard time following this tape. He only demonstrates each move once and then puts it with very fast paced music. It takes alot (and I mean ALOT) of rewinding and repeating to get these steps. If you are really serious about learning this style of dance, and put in the time and effort, then this tape will probably be useful. If you're just curious, then this video has some great performances."
2,Pretty Dance but Pace Too Fast,"I own Celtic Feet. Colin is a very attractive man and a very good dancer. But his instructions are for people who already have experience. He shows you a step slowly, explains it once and then his and his background dancers' feet are a blur of too fast to follow motion. This is not a beginners tape by any means, despite what he says. If you have already studies the dance and are just refreshing yourself, then it is nice. Otherwise, I'd just watch the tape to see what I should look like when after have I already learned."
2,Too fast-paced and not nearly enough instruction,"This video is very hard to follow and is much to fast-paced. They assume a working knowledge of dance which I certainly don't have!And I know this is very sophmoric of me, but everytime I think of the fact that it's by Weinerworld Productions...I go off into gales of laughter! She said weiner...hunh, hunh.But Colin Dunn and everyone in the video are undoubtedly very gifted dancers!"
3,Not for the Beginner,"I am a complete novice and while I could follow and learn some of the steps, there is no attempt by the instructor to teach the rudimentary steps. Without a basic introduction, it is very difficult to learn the dances as a whole. While I enjoyed the video, I believe that some Irish dance experience is necessary to appreciate it fully."
1,Celtic Feet DVD,This DVD is NOT for beginners!!! Collin moves way to fast for anyonewho is just learning to catch on to anything! I would suggestwatching youtube if you want to learn how to do Irish dancingit is easier that way and a lot easier to follow!!!I gave this item one star because you have to give it something.
2,Moves much too quickly!,"Colin Dunne is obviously on top of his game as a dancer, but is lacking in instructional techniques. He just progresses much, much too quickly. Definitely not for beginners."
2,This is NOT for beginners,"I have had this video for years. I only did it for six months. The moves are hard to learn, and if you don't have the proper shoes and the proper floor to practice on, you WILL injure yourself! I got pretty good at the moves but the stomping resulted in Achilles' tendonitis for me, which I still suffer from. If you truly want to learn Irish dancing, take a class from an instructor in a proper setting. Don't risk injury with this video."
2,Not for beginners,As a beginning celtic dancer I did not find this DVD to be helpful. I thought he was hard to follow and he doesn't call out the steps consistently. I don't recommend this for beginners.
2,Too fast for me!,"The steps on this tape move along so fast, it was frequently very difficult to keep up. It needs to explain things better and more clearly. Definately not for beginners or for people with two left feet. I'll pass."
3,Good~ for the first 10 minutes,"i bought this video about a year ago and it was good for the first couple times I saw it~ but no matter how hard I tried~ his steps were too hard once I got past the first couple steps. They are way too advanced and the quality of the video isnt all that great. I would maybe recommend this vieo for a student of irish dancing who already knows the basics, but to a beginner, this is just too difficult."
2,Tea mix for your plants,"The stuff looked like it came from the same bag, it I were asked if there were a difference between the two, the stuff looked sandy and did not mix well with water. My plants showed no effects, ill or good. Not enough change to say it was worth all that money. I think it did not help my plants by using this stuff. What can I say"
5,Top class product - great for home use,"Wireless LAN for the home is going mainstream, with a wide range of compatible 802.11b WiFi products now in the marketplace there is plenty of choice and competitive pricing. 3Com are a big corporate networking player but don't be put off by the ""Officeconnect"" tag. This product was keenly priced and met my needs for a simple home network setup sharing a broadband ADSL connection. Neat slim design, easy setup with the online wizard, good documentation, up and running within an hour or so including encryption and printer sharing. Latest drivers and firmware can be downloaded from the 3Com support website and upgraded without a hitch. The unit will work with any WiFi card in your laptop but I particularly like the associated 3Com card which has a nifty xjack retractable antenna. Wireless range also seems to be good, with strong signals on three different floors, even with concrete walls. Highly recommended."
2,"catchy,but forgetable","while it's cool Snoop has a Big Hit with this cut,i can't feel this cut lasting like some of Snoop's past hits have.it seems like a Jam for the Moment&then forgotten as quickly.catchy Groove but like much of the Neptunes Productions more on a Quick Groove&Beat but less on substance of Songwriting."
3,Very far from Snoop's best work,"The kickoff single for Snoop's new album, ""Drop it Like it's Hot"" is a pretty nifty track produced by the Neptunes. The beat is very simple but fresh and accented with... tongue clicks of all things. Snoop doesn't sound too motivated here, his rhymes are very elementary and he's drastically slowed down his flow too. Pharell gets on the mic here too, and drops some pretty average rhymes. Overall, it's an alright single, but I expect better from a veteran of the game like Snoop."
1,The worst song I've ever heard,"Songs are supposed to have MUSIC, not drum machines and the occasional lame keyboard sound. The video is just as bad, if not worse. AVOID THIS!"
1,"I'm surprised Amazon called this item ""music""","This track doesn't even change in pitch for goodness sake! The background sounds get old in the snap of a finger, Snoop is a terrible rapper as if the genre was open for appeal, and the lyrics especially are just so unbelievably annoying. There is no way in the world that the U.S. can be free of schizophrenics if this song actually got in the Top 40. Guess what? It did! That is so sad. The radio used to play music until rap came along! About ninety percent of rap is useless vulgarity, profanity, and just plain boring beats which really tick me off. I'm guessing this review is going to get a ton of disagrees if people look at it, but that's okay because anyone who supports this rap-crap dynasty hasn't a worthy opinion in my book."
4,Feeling the Cold.,"While Jim Hunter's book is a small one, it packs a powerful message . The poetry is so realistic that at times you can feel the cold as you trudge along beside him. Some would be best read aloud, the better to feel the lilt and rhythm.The works on hunting ""No Fourth Morning"" and ""The Black Box"" left me feeling slightly sick thinking of the trapper and his helpless prey."
5,IS IT POSSIBLE TO WEAR OUT A CD??!!?,This album is amazing! My favorite three tracks on this album:1. Alleluia2. Kyrie3. Om Namaha ShivayaI would have paid the price of this CD for each of the three tracks. Therefore this CD is a real bargain!! I would also recommend the Bliss cd (om namaha shivaya II)
5,Enchanted: The Best of Robert Gass,I have recently discovered sacred chant music and this CD definately takes one beyond the banal music we are bombarded with everyday. One can enjoy this music to lift themself up beyond the mundane and rediscover their inner beautiful place where they can connect with Spirit. This music is soothing and healing. For someone who is new to sacred chant this is a good one to start with.Melissa Lundberg
1,False Advertising,"Does not contain the FULL length songs... very disappointed Kyrie is suppose to be 29 mins long.. I wanted this for my yoga meditation. I expected the full length version for the price.. I hate Amazon.. messed up my perfume order twice. I order the PARFUME not the toilette spray which is cheaper than real parfume and the price..still kept sending me the toilette spray and I went through 3 different vendors, paid for the expensive version as well.. and they never corrected it. I kept sending it back , reorder it still wrong wrong and wrong price.. not to mention ALL the weeks wasted n doing that..."
3,Good movie... if you have patience.,"This movie is rather tedious, as is the low budget 50's films it seems to take after. The dinosaurs LOOK good, but their performances are MUCH too stiff. Gore level is medium, a couple of scenes are a bit nasty. Acting... well, what do you expect from a Corman film? Same with the dialog. An okay movie."
4,The Best Of them All!,"This sequel is much better than the original ""Carnosaur"". Part 2 has some fine special effects & exciting chills.The plot is about a group of technicians who attempt to restore power at a top mining facility... The best in the series."
2,Not bad. A definite step up from the first film.,"You wouldn't think, given how offensively awful the first film was, that anyone would bother with a sequel. You, however, are not Roger Corman. He along with Director Louis Morneau have surprisingly managed to pull off a fairly decent follow-up.It benefits from tighter pacing, an entertaining story that borrows heavily from ""Aliens"", and slightly improved special effects. Even without the generously gory carnage the movie offers, I would still recommend it for the fun back and forth between actors John Savage and Cliff DeYoung. Their dialogue, alone, is nothing short of priceless and adds to the reason why I've given this movie an additional star.All in all, a pleasant surprise."
2,at least it was better than the first!!!!!,"not as good as i thought it would be.Not very good effects,same as the first.It did have a different storyline and better ending than the first.Only if you liked the first!!"
2,A mistake in the movie...,"I was wondering if anybody else saw the mistake on the box. on the side and back of the box, there is a picture from the movie, of a T-Rex picking up a woman in its jaws...but that scene is nowhere to be found in the movie! whats the deal? now my review, it was better than the first by far! the first was a good movie, but i didnt like the ending. it was senseless and didnt apply at all."
5,A B-movie Lover's Feast!,"If Aliens and Jurassic Par were thrown into the mix, Carnosaur 2 would sure to be spawned! This is such a great flick for those of you who din't like everything so ridiciously big budgeted. The sets are convincing, the actors are decent, and while the dinos look rubber as hell (They really steal the show.)During the whole ordeal of a repair group sent into the Yucca Mining facility to fix up the communications and coming face to face with a load of velociraptors and one pissed off T-Rex, this is a B-Movie fav of mine that should not be missed by anyone!"
1,"Lame, Lame, Lame","So much for relying on the stars rateing system. I paid $.79 and it was worth every penny but I got ripped off for the dimes, nickels and quarters. The plot of the evil top secret government instalation is so old that if I had known that was what it was I wouldn't have paid even that much for it. If you like that kind of thing get Resident Evil it's much grosser and equally plotless."
5,Elementary is superb!,"Ill keep it short. If you like Tool, Oceansize, Khoma, Mastodon, Isis, APC etc I really think you can find things on this record that you will really dig! I like most of the above mentioned bands, especially Tool, and this record is a favourite for my top 5 of 2007 and its only feb...:-) Combining crushing riffs, really cool rhythms, melodies, build-ups, different vocal styles (i think Aaron Wolff has a really good voice both his superb ""screams"" and his melodic style. I can put on this record and don't skip tracks because it's so good and that is very uncommon for me!Give this album a couple of listens before you decides if you like it or not, because it REALLY grows on you!!!Standout tracks: most of them but listen to these and if you don't like them you probably won't like the rest so much either - ""The Never Ever Aftermath"", ""Animals"", ""A fell wind"", ""Throwing stones"" and the really slow but extremely beautiful ""And Always..."""
2,OK,"I haven't heard this CD yet, but I was told it features Ernie Krivda on the Sax and Dan Wall on the piano (instead of organ). No drume etc. They play as a duo on the album. Very plain sound !"
2,Telling the ending first ruins the story,"David Ellis attempts to use a different approach to the telling of this story. He begins at the end. But once the cat is out of the bag, there is nothing left of this tale. It could have been an interesting mystery told if told chronologically, but in this manner it was tedious. The confusion is in trying to remember how something was told - was it during another conversation? Was it by the narrator? And with only two people on the audio, it was sometimes difficult to tell the difference between the characters.I was also not very keen on the abridgement version either. The dialogue was trite, the setting non-existant, and the characters stiff and without life. It could have been partly the fault of the voices, but most of the blame belongs on the writing.Very poor effort and barely good enough to finish."
4,Original idea and style,"I generally don't like stories written backwards chronologically, but this was the last David Ellis book that I hadn't read, so I had to try it. About half way through I could see the wisdom of writing it in this fashion. I think in the hands of a lesser author, it wouldn't have worked, but it is very well written and developed. It's an intriguing story with many surprises as you move forward - really backward - that keeps the tension level high throughout the entire book. There were a couple of questions I had at the end (which would be the beginning of the book but the end of reading it) that I would have preferred were made clearer. I felt like I needed to find someone who had read it to discuss it with. But, as with all of Ellis' books, I was always interested and very glad I read it."
2,backward reeled the chapters,"until my mind boggled. reverse chronology only adds to the disjointed plotting in this novel. the setting is non-existent and the characters are not developed well. this tale of murder, suspicion, government graft and international terrorism might be readable in a chronological or backflash order.i am not against ingenious and original writing styles, but in this case the device seems to be used as cover-up for a sloppy plot and cardboard characters."
2,Yoda a Book Writes,"Ellis can usually be counted on to write a riveting thriller with plenty of unique twists. This is a thriller with one unique twist: the chapters are written backwards.It's possible that Ellis first completed this novel in regular format and then inverted the order of the chapters in order to give the book a gimmick. If so, I hope it never happens again. The story itself is convoluted due to the chronololgy being mixed-up, and the twists seem to be a deus-ex-machina.It would have helped Ellis if he'd done more to make us like the characters, but he didn't.This is the first of his books I won't be giving to my friends to read. I'll give it to people I don't like."
4,Outstanding! Ignore the low reviews.,"This is mostly a comment on the other people who supposedly read this book. HOW can you have read it, and comprehended the story, but still have no idea even whether a certain character was alive or dead??You have to pay attention and you will be rewarded with a great story, told in an interesting way. Every time you make an assumption about what is happening, think again because you are probably wrong."
3,"Too clever for its own good, but still an enjoyble read","For reasons best known to himself, David Ellis decided to employ a reverse chronology in this mystery. This is an unfortunate decision I think because it makes the novel very difficult to follow and far less enjoyable than it should be.The story itself is adequate. It opens at the scene of a suicide: a famous author on trial for murder takes her own life. A female cop paired with an understanding male partner feels guilty because it was her job to keep the woman safe.You see, the woman on trial for murder really . . . well, I'm not going to tell you. The plot is solid, the characters not too unreal. I think the story would have been better told without the reverse chronology, but it's still a fun read. Just prepare to be in a mild state of perpetual confusion about what happened when.Jerry"
1,I did not like the reverse chronology,"Agreed - the reverse chronology makes the book difficult to follow. If I want a book that is extremely challenging to follow, I'll read Faulkner with Oprah. A thriller full of scandals and terrorists shouldn't be this hard to read."
2,Original but Confusing,"I have just finished this book, and I found the author's idea of starting at the end of the story and finishing at the beginning was original, but frustrating to me.It seemed the plot changed from chapter to chapter.When I finished the book, I really wasn't positive who lived and who didn't.I found the book interesting, but it was so full of twists and turns, I couldn't seem to enjoy it.Possibly, my brain was either tired or overworked, or just sour grapes.Since so many people seemed to enjoy this book, I may just go back and read it from back to front. Maybe this is a ""novel"" idea. LOL"
1,No and No! Too Ridiculous!,"As others before me, I really hated this book and only finished it because I have enjoyed Ellis' previous books and thought he might somehow pull this off. The backwards episode was one of the few - perhaps the only one - on SEINFELD I did not care for. It was fun the first time, but that was comedy!! Why David Ellis thought this was a good idea I cannot imagine. Perhaps he was bored and liked the novelty of the idea. NO! It was at his reader's expense It was terrorist/politician/scientist/lobbiest all pulled together; a subject I would find boring in the usual format. This is an excellent way to lose the respect of his readers. Forgetting the backwards format, I found one-half page chapters unacceptable, and the writing seemed stilted andamatuerish. Outside of that, well read at your own risk. Oh, in addition I take issue with all the favorable professional reviews. I guess they were afraid to pan it."
1,"Too Stiff, Edges Too Sharp","Spectre 4606 Wire Divider Set - Blue SeparatorsI bought a set of these for use on my '81 Camaro 305 V8. The engine has 8.5 mm Braided Core Spark Plug Wires, so they were somewhat larger in diameter than stock. They also have Silicone Jackets which make them more flexible but softer than stock. Because the molded edges are too sharp on these, combined with a lack of flexibility that would not allow wire engagement without a lot of pressure being applied, I ended up damaging the wires while installing the dividers. Consequently a new set of wires and dividers will be needed. Not good!"
4,Fantastic though pricey,"I regularly take stomach enzymes. Digest Gold is a power house of a product, but it does work. I specifically took them on my trip to China. No stomach problems the entire time! The best, though is that most people, even the locals, get stomach illness when they eat the spicy food of China. This worked like a charm.It also works for the other female reasons that you would want to take the product, though you might just go with the cheaper Acidophilus if you need it for that.One thing to note. Even though the bottle says that you don't need to store in the fridge, if you're going some place particularly hot, you'll want to put these in the fridge in the hotel. Also, if you're going to some place humid for a longer period of time, you'll find that a normal vitamin case will not be adequate to store these pills. Mine did change colors after 10 days of being in the humid and hot areas of China."
1,AWFUL service.,"I ordered this item from Top Team Health & was told within a day or two of ordering it that it had been SHIPPED. Two weeks later, I still had not received the product. When I contacted the company, I was told that the product had in fact NOT been shipped & that the person handling their Amazon orders had quit unexpectedly. So, basically, they LIED to me when they told me initially that it had been shipped. Will NEVER use them again."
3,Russian: A Self-Teaching Guide,"Very good book, useful in teaching a class also in addition to being well arranged for self teaching."
1,Do Not Buy This Book!,"As a native Russian speaker, I can confidently say that this book is awful. People who learn Russian should not waste their money on it.When I was in a book store, I found this book by chance. When I opened it and read couple pages, I was unpleasantly surprised with a huge amount of mistakes. Some sentences looked and sounded so weird. A lot of sentences were written in a strange way that the native speaker would never say like that."
1,Wish I Hadn't,"I hated this book. It's hard to read, and you have to back to previous pages to make your own translations of phrases they give you to ""fill in the blanks"" to complete sentances.I picked this one because it was less expensive. I already had the actual book of Idiot's Guide to Learning Russian, so I figured I'd give something else a chance. I would have been better off getting the same book I had for my iPad, so that I could study it when I was on the go with less weight to carry around.If you're shopping for a beginners lesson book, get the Idiots Guide to Learning Russian."
4,A Great Gift!,"This cloth book is such a good idea for teaching little ones different colors, textures, and how to button, unbutton, zip, etc. I only gave 4 stars for overall because I wish the little parts to the book were attached somehow...they could easily be misplaced. But I would highly recommend this book."
1,Not well-constructed,"This is not well-made. Hems are unfinished, the belt ends were not finished at all and frayed right away. There are no metal rivets around the holes for lacing making it almost impossible for a child to do. The snaps are very difficult for an adult much less a child and as a result, the fabric just ripped around the snap. The only things my child can actually do are the zipper and the train pockets. Not worth the price."
3,"Fun for a while, but strange.","Mine has a:1. Flower button page2. Lady bug zipper page with a baby ladybug inside (best page, so cute!)3. Velcro balloons4. Plastic snap-on shapes (that are so hard to pull of I'm afraid I will rip the shapes right off the snap)5/6. A train with a stuffed girl and boy to put in pockets (the girl and boy kinda look strange)7. Lace the football8. Buckle the belt on the shorts9. Feel the 4 squares (worst page, there is not really a difference in the textures at all)10. Sun/clock looking thing (flimsy)11 and 12 are considered the front and back cover.This book does zip up which is nice, but the cover is weird (lace easter egg heads?)"
2,Disappointed,very happy that i received my box set so fast. but was extremely disappointed that multiple disk holders were broken and one of the DVDs skips due to scratches.
2,That's it for me,"After being disappointed with the first release, I was hesitant to buy the second. I bought it when I found it for half price and generally found it to be a slight improvement. So, I thought I'd give the season 2 release a try. If anything, it is a real step backward. The quality of the discs has not improved. The set contains 25, 20 minute shows, two of which are a ""best ofs"", so it still does not give a lot of show for the price. The scenes are, for the most part censored, and while there are some funny bits including the Man Show Boy there is also a lot of filler, heavy on the monkey bar and Karl Malone. The ""extras"" are basically nonexistent. As far as I'm concerned, they need not release season 3 - I won't buy another."
2,Uncensored Please...,"I'm holding off on buying any of the Man Show seasons on DVD until they release an ""Uncensored"" version. I mean, this is a very funny show, but not really worthy of buying. Now, if they were to release an ""Uncensored"" version, they'd sell about 10 million more copies. That was the only thing that bugged me when I watched it on cable. Sure, it was funny, but because it was on basic cable, I got stuck watching countless shots of blurry cleavage as the women flashed the camera, or walked around naked.If this is truly a ""Man's Show"", it would be uncensored. Maybe women enjoy the ""fantasy of what you DON'T see"", but men, we like it all right there in front of us. There's no need for ""mystery"".Just a tip for the producers of the DVD. Give us more than we can get on regular TV (naked Juggies, etc.) and you'll make millions."
5,This was great!,"I have been looking for this book for over 10 years. After receiving it, I presented it to my sisters - they cried over having something that brought back so many good memories. The Christmas Book will now be shared between the three of us.Thank you so much for bring back such wonderful times by selling this book."
1,Don't bother.,"This is just a warmed-over re-issue of the author's Technical Analysis Simplified, which was not very useful to begin with. You probably can learn more about the subject by surfing the Internet."
5,Another Jessica Thomas Hit,"I thought that I liked Jessica's first book, Caught in the Net, but listen...this second one, Turning the Tables, is really fantastic. Of course having Alex, Fargo, Sonny and the others along again was great. But the easy readability and riveting thought keeps you in it page after page. And the details and nuances are great with Peter and the Wolf and the tacky little house boy, Lewis. Great reading and lots of fun. I recommend it without question.PS. John and I use this site together. He has not read it yet but I have.Ciao, Andy"
4,Dog Eye Wash,I have a dog with chronic eye problems and use a lot of eyewash. This is a big bottle and I got it when I needed another item for Super Saver Shipping. It works well. I just need to enlarge the dropper tip hole.
2,Not as good as the others,"I was really looking forward to reading this, and was disappointed. The Samurai Cat series has gone way downhill since the first three books.I got sick of the constant authorial intrusions, and some of the punning scenes were more painful than amusing.I think readers would be better off getting the first book from a used bookstore than buying this."
4,Pretty Cool,"I just purchased an Hp notebook and needed a little volume boost. This product provided that at a good value. Its not earth-shaking sound, but for the basics that I am using it for (a movie and a game here or there)it is great.Ease of use was another positive. Plugged it in, recognized the product right away and sound was instantly improved.Last great thing was J & R music world shipping. Easy, and received the product 1 day after ordering basic shipping"
1,Barely an improvement over built-in laptop speakers.,"When I first purchased it, I liked it because it did increase the sound of my built-in laptop speakers. However, for watching movies and videos, it's just not loud enough, and the range of sounds is poor. I didn't realize how much I didn't like this speaker until I purchased the ""TRITTON SOUND BITE USB 2.1 PORT"" portable usb speaker, which I rated 5 stars.If you've looking for a small, portable speaker for your laptop which really increases the volume and has a great sound range, I would not purchase this one."
1,Keep your money in your pocket,This speaker is only slightly louder than the internal speakers in my IBM laptop.
5,Heroes of Might and Magic - Hammers of Fate Add-on,"This add-on adds new playable races and new creatures, but the two new features that I like the best, are; the random map generator, and the troop caravans. You can now make an endless number of fun to play maps, that seem more user friendly to me. Also, you can now move new troops from towns or external sources to the town of your choice. You no longer need to devote a hero to transporting troops. I have played all of the previous Heroes of Might and Magic, and this new 3D version is the best yet. Way to go Nival Interactive (Software Developer)."
2,"GREAT GAME, JUST KEEPS CRASHING","GREAT GAME, BETTER THAN THE ORIGINAL, BUT HAS A MAJOR UNSOLVABLE PROBLEM, KEEPS CRASHING AND LOCKING UP MY COMPUTER."
2,"Liked the stick, but only received the short one","I was very pleased with the shooting stick I received, but since I ONLY received the short shooting stick, and did not get the tall shooting stick or the camo bag, I am VERY unhappy with my purchase. I e-mailed the company that I think shipped the item, but I had difficulty even finding who to send a complaint to. I never did get a response to my e-mail, or any customer satisfaction on this. Basically I paid a hefty price for one short shooting stick. What I liked about the stick- it's portable, light weight, and easy to set up. The pointed ends help it lodge securely. If I'd received the bag, it would have been even easier to carry. I'd love to have the rest of the kit, because then I'd probably give it five stars. If I hadn't loved the stick I got, I would have given this purchase 1 star."
2,product stinks,"They were suppose to be 6' tall and two sections and were not,not very happy cause of the price,way to high"
5,A good combination of interesting theories and case studies,"The book offers a comprehensive overview of the central elements in the basic marketing process - target groups, culture, market trends, consumer behaviour etc.The book offers interesting description of the branding process in the companies - as well as the markets that follows the ideas behind ""The Dream Society"", created by Rolf Jensen from The Danish Copenhagen Institutute for Future Studies. Some of the markets are: ""The world of Entertainment"", ""the Market for Adventure"" and ""The Market for Togetherness, Friendship & Love"".The case studies covers for example the danish toy producer LEGO, Virgin, GAP, Heineken and the luxury ice cream brand Häagen Dazs.Really a book worth reading!"
2,Poor effort,"Robin Williams usually does a superb job - she's fun to read, has a perspective which is easy for the reader to understand and puts information clearly while not talking down to readers.Not this time. If you want a book which tells you more than the very simplest of info about Tiger, don't buy this one. I'm an intermediate level user and I found that there are many glaring gaps in her lessons. I ran into many snags in getting used to switching over from System 9 and she didn't address any of the problems. Nor was her basic information about how Tiger operates useful in helping me trouble shoot the problems.I wouldn't recommend the book to a new user either, because it was so superficial.A minor irritant is that the editor (or somebody) did a very poor job of proofing it. There were a significant number of typos throughout the book."
2,Basic Basic Basic,"The best I can say about this book is that the author seems to mean well and writes with a light, fun style. If you're a VERY brand new Mac user AND if you're intimidated by more advanced technical information, this book may be for you. Otherwise, save your money and you'll get better info from the various 'help' screeens on the Mac itself."
4,A great book for the new Mac user.,"It's probably too basic and not technical enough for the real ""geeks"" out there, but for someone who just wants to use their Mac and run applications on it, the book is more than adequate. Very easy to read and it makes a great reference book. Diagrams and color illustrations are excellent."
4,About Mac,"I like Robins ways of teaching, and her book is great. For me it is a bit confusing as I have to keek refering back to other sections. Otherwise great."
1,Check carefully before You put any accesories on or you void the warranty!,"Cap that screws in to puncture the co2 cylinder won't screw far enough to puncture the co2 cylinder and it's not cross-threaded, so I guess I will be sending it to crosman for repairs or a refund This really sucks I bought a scope, muzzle brake,and trigger shoe for this now I don't have anything to put them on."
4,Awesome pellet gun,"Awesome pellet gun,easy to use and it's very accurate. The reviews were very very good and there are lots of ways to customize them. Also,it is very easy to get parts for. By my count it gets 50 shots per co2 tank which I think is very good. Awesome pellet gun for the money."
4,Good deal,"I swore last time I bought a single shot pistol I would never buy another one. Guess what? I did. It sure would be nice if Crosman could somehow design one of these that had a tube of let's say 30 pellets, to spring load every time you pull back the bolt.Also, Crosman, somewhere in your advertising, it would be nice if you strongly suggested to prospective buyers, that they also buy a tube of gun lubricant and use it regularly. I found out, by experience, that the lubricant is very, very important to use regularly, if you expect your gun to last a decent length of time. In actual fact, one of two old CO2 pistols I can actually now use again, because I used lubricant liberally on every spot I could think of. It had never been lubed, by the way. Yup! Stupid me, huh? But, if no one ever tells you to..."
5,super!,"First of all I would like to congratulate Crosman for there level of excellence in producing air guns for decades.The Crosman 2240 has to be one of the most accurate air pistols I have ever held in my hands. The craftsmanship is always been a high standard Crosman. This gun feels good in your hands, and is a pleasure to shoot. For the money you cant beat the 2240; The 2240 far out weighs the value that you will get from purchasing this gun. I recommend it for beginners and for shooters who want to hone their skills in the back yard or basement.A super gun,now time to take it to another level by modification!"
1,don't buy this gun !!!!!,"Save your money, it's not worth it. Let me explain why you should save your money for a better gun. One reason is that it gets about 50 shots per co2 tank. another reason is that if you actually like to take your guns out side then you better make a different choice because this gun is very poor quality, the front sight broke right off when I set it down!!!!"
4,1 FLAW!,The set screw on the rear sight was stripped out when I got it...but I plan on getting a scope anyway!
5,A great book for older sibs,Rosemary Wells is my favorite children's author and this is my favorite of all her books (except now that she has written a book with a protangonist named Emily I may have to change my mind). Few books make a frustrated older sibling feel understood as well as this one -- A Baby Sister for Frances is another that comes to mind -- while reminding them that being the older one is an important job. Every pair of siblings should have this one read to them.
1,"NO MORE, PLEASE!","I am getting sick and tired of people making uneeded sequels to movies like the original C.O.T.C. Quit this sequel crap, please. If you want to se a good sequel running series, watch Friday The 13th."
1,not good,"i hate to say this,but this is a terrible sequel.i usually like COTC,a lot.1-3 were good and i haven't seen 4-6 yet so i can't tell you about those.But this one, no i don't like this one.i wouldn't recommend this to anyone(unless you want to see someone you hate suffer)."
1,Not really knowing the rating,"Its pretty bad that Dimension films wants a seventh Children Of The Corn. Isaac's Return was pretty good but revalation? The story goes that a pair of FBI agents track down a serial killer to a small town, and find out about the town's children and their evil cult. Another sequel dozzer and if ya ask me its not worth watching"
1,Terrible...,"This movie was awful. Apart from the bad acting, the killings were funny too. They characters had no development either, they were all unnecessary. It wasn't scary at all, just funny. LOOK OUT FOR THE KILLER CORN! AAAH! The high point of the movie is when you see the gun-nut character in his apartment. If you look to the left of him right after he closes the door, you can see the mic in the mirror! I laughed for about 5 minutes after that one. Don't waste your time on this garbage."
3,Not bad !,"First of all, this is No. 7 of the series and you don't have to watch any of the previous series. The acting of all the children are bad but the leading actress (Claudette Mink) is OK and she looks lovely in this movie as well. Michael Ironside co-star as a priest (appear total less than 5 minutes). The plot is about the same as the others from the series. About a group of children who are possessed and started killing people who live in run-down apartment building in the middle of nowhere.The DVD is ok. The video quality is fine. The Dolby surround is below average as not much surround activity, the sound comes mostly from the center channel. If you are fans of the series, I suggest you wait until they lower the price as it is too high for a movie of this quality."
2,BORING!,The beginning is extreamly boring but the end I would give five stars. The music was good too but other then that BORING!
1,Worst of the series,"Of all the COTC sequels, this one by far is the worst of the series. It doesnt even have anything to do with the other ones, besides a brief mention of gatlin and ""He who walks behind the rows"" but its just a very brief mention and doesnt really tie into the horrible plot. Also let me say that I,m not strict when rating horror movies, I have liked a lot of them, while others hated them, but I dont see how anyone could watch this movie all the way through without falling asleep or simply dying of total boredom. I mean the only words that the kids use through the first hour of the film is ""Kill"" over and over, It really gets annoying, and the death scenes are also very weak with little to no gore, The sequels before had very graphic, bloody murders. Check this one out only if your a DIE HARD FAN of the series.Rated R for mild violence,language, some nudity and drug use"
4,It was an end,"The people who gave this movie such bad reviews obviously didn't watch it or didn't pay attention to what they were watching. This movie with the title of Revelation was just that for the series. It is a kind of ending which explains where the ""child cult"" got started. Many of the kids did not have names that is true but the important ones did. This movie went a step beyond the other movies, it takes you back to where it all started and just may be the end of it all. I enjoyed this movie a lot, from the silent scenes full of suspence to the loud scenes full of screaming and children's laughter. If you aren't into this series and haven't watched them and payed attention you will find it to make no sense, but if you have then it will all make perfect sense and you will be glad you watched it."
3,"Better than 4, not that that says much.","I just finished watching COTC 7 and I must say...well, I'm torn. It's a good b-grade horror movie, but it just isn't very, well, Children of the Corn-y. I've seen every one of them and this one doesn't *feel* like any of the other ones. I liked 6 much better and I had really hoped that this would do something like that. There are a lot of things that were never elaborated on in the series (the two babies in 5 and 6 being a couple) that could have been. I don't get why they chose to invent a new leader and stuff. There is already so much mythology that I don't think they needed it. Definitely see it if you're a fan of the series. If not, well then it'll probably be just a stupid, low-grade horror movie to you."
4,Excellent for one of these,"Don't get me wrong; ""Children Of The Corn: Revelation"" isn't what you'd call a great movie. It is a decent horror movie, and as far as a ""Children Of The Corn"" film goes, it's excellent. Different standards apply here, but it's one of the best in the series. It has atmosphere, plenty of it, and a good lead performance."
5,Swinging with the Hawk and his friends !,"This reissue of 2 Prestige/Swingville albums from 1961 both feature Coleman Hawkins with a great cast of swing veterans. On sax, you get Hilton Jefferson and Buddy Tate: on clarinet, Pee Wee Russell, Claude Hopkins on piano, and many others. The set is made up of 2 albums:""Things ain't what they used to be"", and ""years ago"", both releasd originally under Hawkins' name.It's all loose relaxed swing music played perfectly by men who played this style most of their lives. Lots of good solos and unison riffing.If you're a fan of swing music or Coleman Hawkins, you'll want to include this in your collection."
2,pretty good,"i really like this movie, though i can't say it's perfect. but i think they did a pretty good job,luckily i watched this on the SCI FI channel,and boy was it worth sitting down for 2 hours,and there is even a carnosaur 4,or ""raptor"" i own it. but i especially liked the rubbery plastic dinosaurs, i loved the t rex and i also loved seeing the plastic monster munching on people. all in all i gave his flick a 2 of 5 it's not perfect but it's pretty good. my advise, watch it."
5,Worth Your Money. It's Fun!,this movie is fun. it's got an army style in it. the movie is very violent and there is lot's of F shots in it. so it's not for children. you might be able to rent it at your video store. but if you want to buy it you have to go online and buy it because it has been discountinued. but don't get the wrong idea about it. the special effects aren't good. they use stop motion for the t-rex. but the movie is good. i have a copy of it. so if you see it anywhere. RENT IT.
1,Beware,"I don't know why so many people gave these movies 5 stars, but you will be disapointed if you spend your money on these movies. They are almost unwatchably bad. Go to IMBD and check out the larger body of reviews."
5,My Least Favorite of the Three,"I don't know what it is, maybe Carnosaur has finally run it's course, but this wasn't at all the best out of the series. The dinosaurs look a little better than in the previous two, but the film doesn't really go anywhere. It's just a rehashing of the previous films. Scott Valentine does a horrible impersonation of Sylvester Stallone and it is very clear that he is trying to do so from the facial looks to the talking, pure Stallone. Like I've said in a previous review, B-rated movies aren't meant to be Oscar winners, but even for a B-rated movie it's pretty bad.Michael McDonald from Mad TV is on Carnosaur once again, this time towards the beginning"
3,It's ok,It's not that bad. No worse than one or two. If you like this kind of movie it is one that you will want to watch at least once. It's ok the first time. There are some stupid scene in it but all you need to do it just by past them. If you don't want to pay full price for it buy it used.
5,AWSOME!,The other viewer I did not agree with. But I can see were he comes from. It might not suit all taist. But I enjoyed it.
2,Alright... pretty cheesy.,"Scott Valentine can be a good actor if he wanted to but it just wasn't his time. If you could notice that the dinosaurs were made out of cheap plastic and FOAM! You could put your finger through those damn dinosaurs! My rating :: 2 out of 10.Also with:Scott Valentine, Erika Eleniak, Rick Dean, Morgan Englund, Cyrill O'Reilly, Justina Vail, George R. Robertson, Dan Hutchinson, Stephen Lee, David Roberson"
3,Great movie to watch at night!,"This is definatly NOT the best movie ever made. But it entertained me alot. Yes, it has its B-moments, but when the dinosaur chomp down on those tasty humans it's VERY entertaining! Althought this is a sequal it is MUCH better that the first two Carnosaurs"
1,Not even worth a concious effert,"Dont waste your time on this one. The special effects are laughable, the cheesy commandos make Arnold Swartzonager look like a theatrical genious, and the plot-line is anything but the least bit complex. Very little suspense + horrible script + amateur effects = probably the worst dinasaur-related horror movie I've ever layed eyes on. Its really that simple. Don't buy it, don't rent it. . . just move on to the next movie."
1,Ugh,"The last of the Canosaur series is a pretty big letdown if you ask me.The acting is horrid,the dinosaur scenes are weak,and the lines and ""quotes"" are lame.Add to that,there is more death and gore than Carnosaur 2,and is nothing like a horror film."
2,Indestructible Primal species...,"A Group Of Anti-terrorist forces are sent to eliminate some escaped flesh-eating carnosaurs in this predictable entry. features dumb dialogue, laughable acting but fans will sure enjoy this."
3,It's movies like this that keep MST3K in business!!!,"In terms of cinematic quality, C3 makes Plan 9 from Outerspace look like Last Year at Marienbad. That's not why it gets 3 Stars. It gets 3 because it's so awful it's fun.Scott Valentine gives it 273% as the leader of an elite, but ineffective, commando squad that must track down (but not kill) a bevy of genetically messed-up dinosaur-type thingies.The sets have that ""just spraypainted"" look and the lighting is brilliantly used to reveal uninteresting scenes while obscuring others which could be important (I'm guessing, of course).The C3 beasts are the ""puppet/man in dino suit"" type; despite this, they aren't badly done. The afore-mentioned lighting and talon-sharp editing help pass them off as mildly daunting.The acting over all, is just this side of atrocious, but everyone looks very nice and seems to be trying very hard, so I wish for them that this is the last Carnosaur film, at least that they'll have to appear in."
1,The worst movie I have ever seen in my life,"As you can see by the shear quality of the cover of the video, you can see that as soon as you open it your in for a treat. After seeing the film my rib rage was in pain and I was crying with laughter. I am immpressed how far a buget of 200 can hire such good quality dinosaur suits, shame about the actors inside them. DON'T buy this movie if you want a horror film DO buy this movie if you want to wet yourself with laughter."
2,For The True Carnosaur Connoisseur Only...,"Terrorists (dressed in badguy black) kill an army brigade in order to steal a truck full of uranium. Oopsy! The truck is full of deadly carnosaurs instead! The terrorists make a lovely snack for 3 mega-reptiles on the go. Soon, a strike force is sent in to clean up the mess, only to become fast-food themselves. Many heads, arms, and other body parts are yanked off in stringy fashion. The dino-marauders are shot w/ thousands of rounds, but are able to regenerate! This proves cost effective, as they just keep returning from their bloody ends. The final, explosive throwdown takes place on a huge freighter at sea. Ridiculous, but (barely) endurable..."
4,"Good book, needs updated","This is a good book for the cyclist seeking roads to ride in Contra Costa, Alameda, and Marin county and was at my bedside as I planned the next day's ride during the 1980's and early 1990's. The book shows you in percent how steep some road grades can be and what to expect. However the book needs to be updated badly, published in the early 1980's, and due to the population and housing explosion in the Bay area and the Delta, some roads have changed and even are not there anymore. I would like to see the author do a book on Calaveras county which has some incredible roads to ride placing it in serious competition with Marin county."
5,Great Book!,"This was a great book; however, it is now irrelevant, since the charts ended in 1999. Is a new one going to be coming out? I've been using them for at least 10 or 15 years and feel lost without it!"
1,"a lemon, in my view","I have read many of her books, and was curious about this one, as it was the book famously rejected by Jonathan Cape for no apparent good reason, much to Mr. Larkin's horror. I am a fan, but when I read it, to my dismay I found it a very unpleasant book. The famous lightness of wit is quite absent, replaced by a turgid narrative about a group of sad unattractive characters, none of whom are even satirized, and for whom I felt nothing at all. Worse still, the Church, although always quietly present in her works, seems to have got such a grip on the writer's psyche, that she is unable to put together three lines without some reference to it, even when it is irrelevant to the action. My feeling is that she had come to the end of a long creative spell and needed a long rest. And this is what happened. When she returned to write many years later, she was a new person.Having said all this, I warmly recommend all her other books."
5,POE Midspan Power Work Great But Currently Over-Priced,I've used these for home network security cameras and found them to perform very well and exactly as specified. I got two of them on Amazon for $14.99 ea plus S&H a couple years ago and now they have myteriously doubled in price. These are not expensive to manufacture and could still sell today for that price if it were not for business buyers driving up the price by assuming the more expensive POE power supply devices must be more reliable.
4,"theory, not application. but not much theory.","The book is written as an overview of all aspects of nuclear medicine, and is successfully comprehensive in scope. It is more of a 'theory' book in that it does not offer, by proportion, much clinically relevant information. The theory happens to be limited in its derivations and is presented semi-qualitatively (equations are offered, but usually too general for those with research interests), though I'm sure it would have to be much thicker to incorporate said information.Ultimately, it is a very accessible introduction to the science and would be useful in preparation for Nuc Med or Radiology (and similar) board exams, if augmented with more quantitatively detailed texts."
4,Good Doctor's story written in the eary 1900s,"My grandma introduced this book to me and I have since collected all the ""Red Pepper"" books. Red Pepper Burns is a doctor with red hair and a temper to match it, but he has a big heart. He drives at top speeds in this car the ""green imp."" He provides amusement and aid to his neighbors who live on either side of his house. He never comes to their dinner parties on time because his is ""always on a case."" He is well-loved by his friends and neighbors. He meets a widow who is living with his neighbors and proceeds to court her is a regular ""Burnsy"" fashion."
5,Perfect,"Works exactly as needed, changing strings faster, and easier. Everything I could have ever hoped for in a string winder!"
3,You get what you pay for,"This item is cheap but then again look at the price. I have found that on Amazon if it sounds to good to be true, it is."
3,Fender String Winder,"Well, aside from not being able to chosse the color product I wanted, it works and its cheap. Have not had any issues with this item and cannot see why someone would buy a power string winder. This seems to be just fine."
3,ocasionally used,"well, is an item used ocasionally it's very helpful when you cord at first your guitar.It's very awkward do it by hand.Then this is when the accesory take their part."
3,Sit & Solve Cryptograms,"My mother-in-law loves Cryptograms and wanted Cryptograms for Christmas.She let me know that she thought ""Sit & Solve Cryptograms"" was a bit too hard for her."
2,Cheap price/Cheap product,"You really can't expect much if you're not willing to pay for it, but overall I would have taken a pass on these if I'd seen them in person up front. Basically you get two 5.5""x12"" cedar blocks with three pre-drilled holes and then three slats which are about 1.5"" x 1/2"" with dowels on the end that fit into the pre-drilled holes. Basically a middle school shop student could make these without any problem.One of my slats came without the dowel and was not pre-drilled. It didn't come with any extra dowels so I had to improvise. The pieces were only mildly sanded and there was no sanding done at all to the exit side of the pre-drilled holes...long splinters and a pretty unfinished look.On the other hand, it is made of cedar which smells great and isn't cheap...but if you found a good deal on 1x cedar, you could easily make the equivalent product yourself."
2,Not worth the price,I bought two of these to stack and wish I had saved the receipt and box to return them. The space between the racks is very small. I can barely fit the shoes in them. The depth is also limited and does not fit adult sized shoes very well. The edges are sharp - my husband scratched his leg going around the corner. An almost useless product and way over priced!
4,A math book,"This isn't the easiest linear text I've scene. This also isn't the hardest. The book has a ton of applications, which is good if you're an applied math, engineering, or science major. If your interests are in pure math the applications are still a nice little side note. The book's explanations are explained as clearly as possible without giving up any rigor. At first I didn't like the book, but after looking at several other linear textbooks I realized that these authors did a good job of explaining a difficult topic."
1,One of the WORST textbooks I ever used,"This book sucks at explaining, half the examples in this book just refer you to other examples/exercises that you have to complete yourself. HOW DOES THIS HELP IF YOU HAVE TO DO THE PROBLEM YOURSELF??!? Half the practice problems are theoretical questions that do not help you in understanding the concept whatsoever. The only thing it does is confuse and frustrate you more. Whoever uses this textbook to teach is obviously incompetent and/or has not looked it over at all."
5,The Five Pennies,"What a delightful movie. I had forgotten just how wonderful Barbara Bel Geddes was as a ""Movie Star"". Most of us remember her only as ""Miss Ellie"" of Dallas but this movie proves she was much more. In this movie she sings, dances and acts her tail off. I have watched this over and over again."
4,Nice Sounds In This Classic Film,"Danny Kaye plays Red Nichols, a famous coronet player of yesteryear. I found this story a notch better ""fair"" and nicely aided by the musical talent of Louis Armstrong.Kaye and Armstrong's duet on ""When The Saints Go Marching In"" is the highlight of the film.For a classic movie, the stereo in here is amazing, especially on the songs. In one instance, there are three people singing and their voices all coming out separately on different speakers. Pretty good for just a VHS tape. Now that a DVD has been released, I wonder what the sound on that is like?The story starts to lag a bit near the end when Kaye starts to feel sorry for himself and this goes on and on as he retires from playing. However, there is a nice, sentimental upbeat ending.Notes: Kaye and Barbara Bel Geddes, who plays Red's wife ""Bobbie,"" never age in the film even though it spans 15 or more years! It's also interesting to see Tuesday Weld as a teenager."
5,Great musical/jazz at its best,"'The Five Pennies' has been one of my favorite musicals for over 30 years. I've seen it many, many times and rate it up there with the Christmas classic ""It's a Wonderful Life"". Danny Kaye does a superb job with his role as Red Nichols. Barbara Bel Geddes (before Dallas) is great in her supporting role. The musical interludes such as ""When the Saints Go Marching In"" with Louie Armstrong are just amazing. This movie is a must for anyone that enjoys old 40's and 50's movies or Dixieland jazz."
5,A brilliant film about looking on the bright side,"Absolutely my favorite Danny Kaye movie, with outstanding performances by Barbara Bel Geddes and the small fry who played Red's daughter. She absolutely captured my heart, and was totally at home with her part in the movie. Louis Armstrong was perfect. I only wish he had had a bigger part. A friend of mine loaned me this movie, and it was a wonderful movie that I almost didn't watch because of other things I needed to do. Hooray for this great film!"
5,I loooove Danny Kaye!,"Let me start by saying...I loooove Danny Kaye! I have this movie on VHS but no longer have a VHS player. Do my dismay I found that the movie was no longer in release on DVD, apparently I was a few years late. My boyfriend located the DVD on Amazon and it arrived to my surprise shortly thereafter. The Five Pennies is a great movie and I recommend it highly, along with any other Danny Kaye movies of course! My favorite song is the medley of ""The Five Pennies"", ""Lullaby in Ragtime"" and ""Goodnight, Sleep Tight."" Louis Armstrong and Danny Kaye are great in ""The Saints"" too. That whole night club scene is great - the movie is great - WATCH IT!"
4,Danny Kaye & Louie Armstrong,"Nice band leader story with great music. Danny Kaye and Louie Armstrong perform a rendition of ""When the Saints Go Marching In"" that is a memorable event in the history of movies! It is reason enough to watch this film."
3,The Five Pennies,"Typical romanticized biopic, but worth watching for the good music. Interesting appearances by famous jazz musicians."
4,The Five Pennies,A rather more different production to feature Danny Kaye but his talents are ably displayed as he portrays a musician and father. Be prepared for some sad parts but many aspects of the story ring true to life. Lots of great music and the scenes with Danny Kaye and Louis Armstrong together are cinematic gold.
5,K&N Air Filter for 2007 Suzuki XL7,"Great product. I have been purchasing K&N; filters for my cars for 10 years now. They do work. Faster pickup, faster passing, better fuel economy. I put this filter into my 2007 Suzuki XL7 SUV and it made a tremendous difference in the cars acceleration. The extra airflow helps the car perform better across the entire power range.K&N; filters are keepers!"
1,Very disappointing; a paraphrase; not worth buying,"This book contains a loose paraphrase of Therese. It does not offer an experience of Therese or of her ""way of confidence and love,"" and suffers from lack of fidelity to her extraordinary writings. If you want to spend 30 days with a great spiritual teacher, read the originals."
1,an unfortunate paraphrase of the writings of a great saint,"Instead of reprinting excerpts from the splendid text of Therese, ""Simply Surrender"" is a poorly written and confusing paraphrase of Therese's ideas, which suffer in the translation. I recommend insteadSt. Therese of Lisieux: Essential Writings (Modern Spiritual Masters Series), edited by Mary Frohlich, which is an excellent selection of the saint's most important writings."
3,A somewhat good read,"This book had a great setup and premise: Amanda, whose son was missing for the last seven years, suddenly finds he's been raised by Garth, who erronously thought Amanda's son was his own. Her son is sick, and Garth wants to hold back on revealing the startling news about his parentage until he gets better.For the goodwill of their son, Garth and Amanda marry. However, it is unclear if this marriage will last since they've married for the son's health reasons.Garth, a non-believer, refuses to receive Amanda's Christ, which is cause for a big conflict, and a rift in their relationship.I thought this book was fairly good, but it did tend to drag in a few places. However, I would definately consider reading other books by this author."
3,General reference material,"This is good general reference manterial providing ""some"" information on all of Hall's products, but doesn't give complete information on any one pattern or line."
4,Made an excellent gift,"Bought the book as a gift for my wife. While she is not a ""professional"" Hall china collector she is serious enough that ever time we go to a new city/town/state she wants to stop at an antique shop. This book is well organized and has quality photographs. The book as a gift was well received but not exactly what she was looking for. She wanted to see the full line of the Red Poppy line. While to book displays and discusses many pieces, it doesn't cateloge them in that way and to be fair I don't think that is it's intent. The book presents many of the Hall lines, gives tips on who to shop, where to shop and gives help in identifying non-authentic pieces and gives advice on determining values. It's a great book and valued in my wife's collection but it just didn't cover all pieces of Red Poppy - but perhaps no book does."
1,Why?,"Why does Tomas Lindberg spread himself so thin? With this band, The Crown, Disfear, and Nightrage he does what he has always done and that should be great right? Wrong. Too much of the same old thing gets sickening and this is no exception. And the music is boring and dare I say almost nu-metal? Terrible"
4,Red and Stanley,"My son loves these cars' toys. Red (the fire engine) is great. My son takes it in the bath, throws it around and bangs it up. It is extremely well made and last through whatever abuse my son dishes out. However, he doesn't seem to play with this particular set as much as some of the others. And I was a little dissapointed in the Stanley statue. Unlike the other cars which are sturdy, Stanley was cheap plastic. And I am not sure why they included it with Red as a set."
3,small truck,"i was expecting a much larger truck for the price, but our 6 year old neighbor really enjoyed this toy."
3,"Two Shoes, No Hive","I really enjoy using this doll with my preschoolers, to build phonological awareness and vocabulary. However, beware!! Mine came with a shoe in the 2 pocket (which is correct) AND the 5 pocket (which should have a hive instead). I sent it back for a replacement, and the replacement doll had the same problem. I ended up making my own hive for the 5 pocket."
3,Now wait a minute here.....,"Exactly how many greatest hits albums do Quiet Riot have? There's this one, Winners Take All, and oh yes, Quiet Riot's Greatest Hits. How many times can you buy Metal Health????? They're a good band and I've always liked them, but quit with the compilation albums, who do they think they are, KISS?"
4,Nice introduction to other Arabic percussion instruments,"As the name suggest this DVD covers several arabic percussion instruments with the main one being the darbuka. The core information being taught are middle eastern rhythms and the performance by the Bar-Ilan University ensemble are quite good. Yinon begins the video by performing a great solo on the darbuka using Turkish finger style however he doesn't go on to teach this advanced style.Because so much has been crammed in the amount of information on technique is light so might not be useful for absolute beginners. As well Yinon is of the school of thought who likes to classify the Baladi rhythm as Maqsoum, and a Maqsoum rhythm as a slow fellahi.This video will be most useful for beyond beginners to advanced darbuka players who are also looking at learning about other Arabic percussion instruments."
2,Not my favorite way to add fiber to my diet,"Yuck...this stuff tastes terrible. I have tried mixing it into smoothies, water, fruit juice, coffee and cereal, and no matter how I try, I can't get rid of the bitter, dusty taste. I find the taste to be a combination of bitter sawdust, cardboard and nasty herbs, that is impossible to hide in any food. I am sure it is very healthy and good for digestion, but I just cannot stand the flavor it adds to foods and beverages. It does not dissolve completely, so anything it is mixed in to becomes extremely gritty. I think I'll stick to ground flaxseed and wheatgerm to add extra nutrients and fiber to my diet."
5,Great show,"My whole family loves this show. I actually bought this for my teenage son. Betty White is so funny, she steals the show."
5,FUN GIFT,I GAVE THIS AS A CHRISTMAS GIFT AND THE PERSON WHO RECEIVED IT WAS VERY HAPPY AND LOOKS FORWARD TO WATCHING THE SHOWS. HOT IN CLEVELAND MAKES YOU SMILE AND GIVES YOU LAUGHTER !!!
3,Could have been a 5,"the clarity of the shows was great. I would have given this a 5 except that it continually crashed. That problem straightened out finally, but not until the last few episodes. Once the crashing problem was ironed out, if was fine."
5,"Great for Laughs, not to be critical","Do not be critical of the errors, This show is made to be of High quality Laughs and Quick Entertainment.When you see how it was made (many ""takes"" on the ""goofs"" reels), then you can make your own in the same manner.More seduction for young men in heart!"
1,Not so good,"I was excited to see Hot in Cleveland. But I still did not click with all the actors and especially their character.Actress Valerie Bertinelli is not really funny and I dont even think she fits for that sitcom. I love the other three, but still I dont like this sitcom.I have bought Season 1 and 2 in hoping it will be another great funny sitcom... Well.I dont find the stories amusing.I hope to get rid of both dvds. Maybe someone else loves to watch it."
5,Classic,"A passionate document in eloquent prose. Mary Wollstonecraft was a terrific polemicist and this is her most brilliant work, a deeply moving diatribe against the repression of women. I dare any man to read it and remain unmoved! This is a true classic."
4,"Helpful, interesting writing from a female Enlightenment thinker","I read Mary Wollstonecraft's piece, A Vindication of the Rights of Woman, for a western civ class. Initially, I found the text hard to understand. However, if one pairs the piece with Rousseau's writings (particularly Emile, or, On Education) the writing really comes to life. Ms. Wollstonecraft wrote this book as a rebuttle of some of Rousseau's beliefs. When the two are coupled, it is very interesting to compare and contrast. Great place to start when looking at the true meaning of ""equality"" a famous mind like Rousseau was striving for at this time period. Dense prose, though. Be warned!"
5,A must read!,"For anyone into philosophy, this is a definate read. A product of the Age of Reason, Mary Wollstonecraft applies reason to why women should be educated equally with men so both may benefit from virtue. Very intriguing even for a man. Read it."
4,Important read,"This book is an important read in understanding the struggle for equal rights for women. It's sad that today in many cultures today women face the same problems that Ms. Wollstonecraft and her contemporaries faced in 1792. One item of note about this particular version of her work is that the picture on the front of the book is NOT Mary Wollstonecraft. You would think that a book by Mary Wollstonecraft would have her picture on the front, instead for some reason Penguin Classics decided to put a portrait of Madame Roland. Why? Not sure."
5,A vindication of the rights of woman,A historic tract that lives up to its reputation.It's hard to think that one would read any regency romances without also reading this book.
4,hilarious audiobook,"The dry, ironic narration, the overblown pompousness of the main character, and the great variety in the supporting cast make this a memorable book. Barrett Whitener proves he has great range in voicing Ignatius and Jones, and his brisk style benefits the time-strapped listener. Hilarity abounds in Ignatius' misadventures, but his mother's sadness over her son's social senility grounds the book in a grim reality. An ambiguous ending does not derail this comedic gem."
4,Fast service & great book,The book came really fast and was just as the ad described. The book is very interesting...different from my usual James Patterson. I really like it and would recommend it to anyone looking for a good read.
3,"Larger Than Life In Many, Many Ways","Ignatius Reilly is larger than life in many, many ways. Educated, opinionated to the extreme, possessing a faulty valve - he is quite a unique character, almost a caricature of himself. John Kennedy Toole weaves an interesting tale that brings to life some particularly unique New Orleans rhythms of life and speech along with a cast of wacky individuals. I am a big fan of Carl Hiaasen and thought that A Confederacy Of Dunces was a forerunner of his style and casting with some out of this world characters especially ground breaking as it was written in the late 60s."
5,fun read,"New Orleans misadventures of a most useless individual. Now there's a real statue to Ignatius in New Orleans, due to the impact of the book. It is a very enjoyable read."
5,confederacy of dunces,Absolutely remarkable reading this story.... the loss of this writer/artist was a tragedy; that he at least left us this story is a true blessing...best read this month..!!
4,Very comical with some sad bits.,I thoroughly enjoyed this book I can‘t remember laughing this much with any other book. ForWho loves a good read.
2,Don't Be Fooled By The Hype,"I finished reading this book a few weeks ago, and have since totally forgotten about it, which I dare say is probably not a good thing. I did not find ""Dunces"" funny, nor even amusing and barely entertaining. I read it at the urging of a friend whose opinion I respect - I no longer respect his opinion (at least about what books to read.) I will nonetheless give credit to Mr. Toole for the flawless structure of his book. His ability to make seeingly unrelated events interact to eventually produce a coherent picture is truly remarkable. But, other than the well-planned narrative, I found this book wholly uninteresting."
2,"I really wanted to like this book, but . . .","I read this book a couple of years ago after having read rave reviews of it and an article stating that Toole was nothing short of a genius. I really thought that I'd like it. I tried to like it, but I had to struggle just to get through it. I thought that Ignatius was a fatuous, unlikeable windbag, and after a hundred pages or so I just wished someone would throttle him. What killed this book for me was that I just didn't care about Ignatius. I will try to reread this book in the next few months to see if my opinion has changed. If this book entertains you, great, its just didn't work for me."
5,A Confederacy of Dunces,"This is quite simply the greatest book ever written. The basic premise seems almost ordinary, but in the hands of JK Toole, it becomes a magnificent one man circus, a triumph of crass stupidity over reason and normality.It is crammed with self- referential ""in-jokes"", which may pass you by on the first reading. The characters are believable, immaculatley brought to life by the authors incredible style- you can almost taste the New Orleans atmosphere, and its collection of Vagrants, losers, lunatics and heroes that are the books cast are observed with empathy and admiration. The central character is surely the creation of a genius, and the plotlines draw you in to their spiralling web, until they collide with uproarious humour in one of literatures truly Great moments. Few works deserve the title ""Masterpiece""- this is surely one."
2,I Don't understand all the hype,"Just finished this so-called masterpiece and found it to be an average read at best. Yes, there were parts that made me chuckle, but they ran about even with those that bored me enough to fast forward through some sections. I leave this book without keeping a memory of even one likeable character.I'm glad for those readers who found this book to be so enthralling. I'm glad we all don't have the same likes and opinions or it would make for a very dull world."
2,No gut-busting here,"This must be one of those books that people either love or hate. I read the entire book because of the high praise it has received. To be honest, I wanted to toss it after two chapters. I have a very good sense of humor. Salman Rushdie's ""The Moor's Last Sigh"" made me laugh for hours on end. This book did nothing but depress and disgust me. If Toole's life was anything like Reilly's, I can understand his depression. The quality of the writing and the level of imagination exhibited in the book are both very high. As a literary study the book has merit (the Pulitzer is questionable). This book unequivocally did not live up to the jacket reviews."
2,A strange novel.,"It is not consider good form to laugh at deranged people. The main character is dreanged, and if you ever personally known someone like him, you would not like this novel. On the other hand, I read it to the end. The really likeable and funny character is Jones. I hope the fact that he is black does not offend anyone. His character makes everyone else look insane. This is a well writen book, and since I listened on tape, the narration was excellent. There really is no plot in the book. Its a bunch of miserable characters living in disorder. If there is a plot, its Riley's descent into madness. And again, apologies to New Orleans, but where else is more likely to discover a cast of characters living on the edge of sanity.This is not a book to take to the Beach, or read after a friend or relative is hospitized for a mental disorder. It will not help you understand the problem. The only benefit this novel has, is to remind us that there is a lot of troubled folk out there."
3,Not so new,"The book is great. However, this was represented to be a new book, yet it didn't look new. i purchased this book as a gift; I already had a copy of my own. My own copy, which I had read, was cleaner than the one I ordered."
5,A comical semi-autobiographical story from a great author.,"Ignatius, Jones, and the others take you on a hilarious roller coaster tour of the New Orleans pornographic picture industry!!! It is smoking hot with strippers, hookers, gays, and alcoholics centered in the Night Of Joy bar!!!"
3,Great characters but ultimately boring,"Ummmm, I think I have mixed feelings about this book, and it seems I am one of the few people who neither worship it nor hate it. I really enjoyed the originality of the setting, the bizarre characters and Ignatius Reilly, what a riot! His dialogue is absolutely sharp and hilarious, we have to give credit to the author for this. And Ms. Trixie, ooohhhh!!! My favourite character of the novel, no doubt! But somehow the story lacks a plot, and Ignatius's ramblings become derivative far too early into the book. I'm sure I appreciated the humour and sarcasm in the story, but a better developed plot would have given it five stars."
2,Forgettably unfunny,"I bought this book on the strength of its reviews,a nd the fact that I was in the mood for a laugh-out-loud novel. Instead, I have stumbled upon a situation similar to the emperor's new clothes....does everyone really find this book funny, or are they all jumping on the bandwagon? After attempting the first 150 pages, feeling repulsed, and finding little humor, I had to stop. What others must find as humor is really cynicism disguised with a patina of offensiveness. It's sad that O'Toole committed suicide, but if the theory that all novels are autobiographical holds true, Ican see why O'toole/Ignatius did"
2,This is a classic?,"1) It's over-written.2) The characters are sledgehammers with little subtlety and less credibility.3) The dialogs are boring, trite, and artificial.4) The humor is forced.5) The scenes are too long for their content.6) I'll give it a star for mass.In short, it is precisely what I would expect the intellectual elite to choose for a classic.For everybody else, it needs a laugh track."
2,Seriously?,"Someone compared this disaster to the Seinfeld tv series, and I suppose I would agree. I never had much appreciation for Seinfeld and its desperate grasps at comedy; just so, Confederacy of Dunces relies largely on slapstick, nerve grating characters, and meandering plot. The book drags on and on--the climax, that should indicate an easy, swift road to the conclusion, is so backward that the last 20 pages will be even harder to read through than some of the middle 20 pages.In all fairness, there was some effective comedic elements; the voices of the characters were unique, and the language was elegant. Its hard to say exactly why this greatly lauded, Pulitzer Prize winning novel failed to live up to my expectations, what literary mechanics failed Toole, but I would approach the reading of this book with a grain of salt or two. Not something I would ever read twice."
1,Still Have Memories (Bad) About This Book,"A misguided friend of mine gave me this to read while I was in the hospital around 30 years ago. It was new at the time, and praised highly. I couldn't stand it. The novel was boring, amateurish and unreadable, obviously written by a talentless individual. (The first chapter felt like trying to run a marathon in quicksand.) I still don't understand why it was published, except perhaps to prove that Pulitzer prize winners are usually overrated. Awful."
1,Hideous.,I enjoy farces when they reveal truths about life or if the characters arouse sympathy. I found none here. Toole's absurd whining grew tiresome quickly.
1,Did not get it....,"Due to the high praise I think it's a hit or miss and for me it was certainly a miss. I got through half of it which I thought was an accomplishment - it is so boring, pointless and at moments simply strange. I did not find the humor in it; the main character is a loser....that's it!"
1,The abridged versions sucks!!!,"Even though the book was a masterpiece and the unabridged audio version might be great, Arte Johnson ruins the shorter abridged version on audio from the very beginning! His horibble attempt to capture the New Orleans accent is criminal and his voice is annoying at best. I recommend that you purchase this audio book to seek revenge upon on you most hated enemies! If you are the fan of the original book as I am. DO NOT BOTHER WITH THIS ABOMINATION!!! IT LACKS THE THEOLOGY AND GEOMETRY that John Kennedy Toole included in the book!"
1,One of my WORST reads!!,"Perhaps its me, pehaps not. That notwithstanding, I found the characters to be two dimensional not the least bit likeable. I had to 'slugg' my way thru this book on the hopes it would just get better, and the ending was perhaps the most dissapointing of all!! I wouldnt recomend it to anybody..."
1,Does not keep it's promises,"How hilarious. A fat man and his mother encumber us with their uninteresting lives in New Orleans. If you read other reviews you see that this book promises knee-slapping, uncontrollable howling with every turn of the page. Well I waded through the first 40 pages with nary a grin before giving up on the promise to keep me in paroxisms of laughter. It ain't funny. It ain't interesting. It will, however, cure anyone's insomnia"
5,All Time Classic,"One of my favorite books. Subversively funny. Crude, indignant, and dead on. A must read if your are a lover of satire or New Orleans!"
3,Somebody bring me a cold Dr. Nut!,"A very amusing read. I enjoyed following Ignatius Reilly, pedantic blowhard par excellence, blunder through one madcap caper after another. My main criticism of the book is that it relies too heavily on stereotypes as the main source of comedy. That said, I was impressed with Toole's ability to write a variety of different dialects for the characters' dialogue. I also greatly enjoyed how closely Toole refers to the city of New Orleans, its street names, landmarks, culture, etc.By the end of the novel, I had grown rather fond of Mrs. Reilly, Jones, Santa Battaglia, Myrna ""the minx"" Minkoff, Patrolman Mancuso, Lana Lee and Darlene. May they live on in the pages of this epic, absurd, oddly charming satire forever."
5,It Is What it Is,"This book is marvelously amoral and it will do little to raise anyone's social conscience. Ignatius is a ridiculous name for a protagonist and the author makes him so disgusting that the reader doesn't know what to make of the guy or his story. As a piece of literature it is brilliant, oddly beautiful, funny as hell, and impossible to place in any known genre. I recommended this book to my 22 year old son and he practically has it memorized. We now call each other up and talk about our pyloric valves. When I was his age I didn't really get this book. I love it now."
5,Phenomenal,"I cannot think of a funnier novel written in the last century. If Toole were still with us, he'd be the Mark Twain of New Orleans."
1,Surrounded by idiots,"I am surrounded by mostly idiots where I work, so having to read about idiots and their actions, was very frustrating and not entertaining at all."
5,ya gota love it or hate it,"I have a friend who calls this book the litmus test. If someone ""gets it,"" you know they ""get it"" about life. I can't even tell you how many years ago I read this book, and to this day, if I'm in even the slightest of questionable moods, I can pick it up, fan to any page, and instantly be transported into paroxysms of laughter at the wonderful insanity of this character's insistance on his view of the world, and his unwitting (?) subversion of same. I wonder if it isn't the true test of great literature that it must separate us as 'Confederacy' does. My advice? Try it. If you love it, you are one of us ""gifted' (read insane) on this journey. If not, perhaps you have been spared by the more sane of the gods. Either way, enjoy, and may Fortuna be with you!LM"
5,One of the three funniest books ever published.,One of only three books that have made me laugh out loud. The sad fate of John Kennedy Toole adds to the aura surrounding this masterpiece of modern American literature. Why hasn't this been made into a movie? Perhaps because Fellini's dead?
1,Doesn't live up to the hype,"The protagonist is weird, he belches a lot, he loses his job. There. Save yourself ten bucks and move on."
1,Least enjoyable novel I've read in a long time,"This is without a doubt the least enjoyable novel I've read in a long time. It came highly recommended, so I slogged through, waiting for it to get better. It never did."
2,Too strange to be good,"It won a Pulitzer? My only explanation for it is that the committee must have figured if *they* couldn't understand it, then it must be good. But I would disagree. I swear I wrote an assignment in 9th grade English that was remarkably like this book in style, and it got a 'D.' I'd have to say this book is different, sure, but ... It did have a few very wry and funny passages, but overall I didn't like the story or the style."
1,"Tedious, pointless and uniformly unfunny","Neither comic nor a masterpiece, this book becomes more oppressive with the turn of each page. Reading the sophomoric prose is like being slowly buried under sodden newspaper. Nevertheless, being in the minority here, I truly wonder what I might be missing. I beseech and BEG the admirerers of this book to cite a paragraph, a sentence or a turn of phrase they consider to be masterful and comic, or just comic, or just masterful. I ask that in sincerity because, far from finding anything humorous or well written, let alone masterful, I found myself astonished that anyone could be even mildly amused or impressed, other than by the fact that the author actually had the will power to watch this much paint dry."
1,Couldn't finish it.,"It seems like you either love this book or hate it. I guess I'm just not getting what is so great about it. The main character is detestable, and they are always ""screaming"" at each other. I only managed to get about 2/5 through it before realizing I was not enjoying it at all. I tried, but it just wasn't for me."
2,"too long, not funny as hyped to be","Three quarters into the book I wished I hadn't spent the time reading it. It was fatiguing to read the same arguement over and over, nothing new develops about the characters, nothing made me want to finish. I skimmed the last one quarter. Maybe East Coast intellectuals can laugh at the antics of those silly southerners but here in the Northwest I prefer my humor more dry."
1,Never purchase a Dove Audio product.,"I have read this book no less than 7 times. I have seen the play and I anxiously await the making of the movie. I have been a big fan of books-on-tape for a long time. However, Dove Audio needs to get out of the business. Whoever wrote or edited this audio book for Dove should stay with Dove because I no longer purchase their publications - I avoid them like the plague. Reader is very important. It is hard to match F. Murray Abraham, Tony Roberts or Judith Ivey as quality readers, which is clearly demonstrated by Dove who employs the likes of Arte Johnson and Roddy McDowall (Batman). Dove may as well retain Danny Sugerman (No One Here Gets Out Alive) or Stephen King (several bad readings) as readers. All in All, A Confederacy of Dunces on tape was a HUGE disappointment. I had to go back and re-read the book to ease my suffering after listening to this Dove Audio product. HMB"
1,Horrid boredom,"I had to give up after 60 pages, and scanned the rest. There was some interest in the way he writes and his strange, stupid characters. But it gets tedious after awhile - nothing happening, and certainly NO humor. What a waste of time."
1,Dunces Unite!,"Apparently a college education doesn't count for much anymore. I really, really tried to get into this book. Finally, I just gave up. Sorry, I just don't get the appeal of this book. I am now a member of the confederacy of dunces that believed the hype about this silly book."
1,I wished for spontaneous book combustion!,"What this book lacked in humor, it made up for in absurdity and tedium. With a motley assortment of irreedemable losers and a poorly constructed and boring plot, the reading of this book is only slightly more pleasurable than being poked in the eye with a sharp stick."
2,I don't get it,"There were some funny antics in the book, but the characters themselves just turned me off. Reading this book made me feel like watching someone eat a live bug - you want to see what happens, but are grossed out and disgusted afterward. This book went immediately into the ""give away"" box when I was done."
4,LOVE IT OR LEAVE IT,"Like many of the reviews Ignatius J. Reilly is either adored or despised. I'd have to say for myself that the first three chapters made me want to throw Ignatius and this book into the fireplace. Slowly Ignatius gained my appreciation. This educated fool, with his brash comments and warped sense of imagination made me laugh out loud. By the end of the book, I felt myself cheering for him. If you don't like satire, stay away from this book. Ignatius is the type of character that you'll either love or hate."
4,"Decent, predictable story highlighted by descriptive dialog","This tale of obese Ignatius Reilly, his mother, and his misadventures in New Orleans does not live up to its standard of being a hilarious book. The plot is good, but nothing spectacular: All the characters connected to Ignatius go about their unusual lives until a rather satisfying but predictable end that pretty much ties them all together.The clever dialog is what gives this book a lift. The extreme ends of the educated community are brought together, and their interactions work extremely well in keeping the story interesting.It is unfortunate that John Kennedy Toole is no longer with us, for this story shows tremendous potential"
5,Long live NOLA!,"I love this book and read it once or twice every year. With that said, I totally understand the conflicting reviews of this book. One either loves it or hates it. Not much middle ground. Ah,the beauty of lit, music,and art. . .Subjectivity! Ummmmmmmm, anyone care to discuss the greatness of Jackson Pollock????"
2,Just a sad tale of an equally sad boob!,"I had a hard time getting through this book, but I read it. Did not see the humor in making fun of such a sad character."
2,Totally unremarkable,"The only interesting thing that kept me going through this book is the fact that so many people loved it. I am quite an omnivorous reader, but this book offers nothing. Even the fart jokes are not funny. I can't understand people (90%!) who professed unrestrained love for this book. Only a little better I can understand those who hated it - probably just a reaction to all the hipe. I did not love or hate this book. This book did not offend me. It bored me."
2,A struggle,I finally had to put this away without finishing. I found it tedious and not even remotely funny. I got through about half of it and never found anything to hold my interest.
5,A shame Toole isn't still around,"As funny as this book is, as dead-on as the dialogue is, as fascinatingly complex as the supporting cast is, the centerpiece of this fantastic novel is (of course) Ignatius Reilly. But perhaps Toole's greatest accomplishment is in carefully tempering Ignatius' buffoonery with a profound sense of sadness. With his thunderous, pretentious, hilarious and desperate lamentations on Modern Society, Ignatius is at once the Town Cryer, the Royal Hero and the Village Idiot."
2,Bathroom humor,"I suppose this isn't the worst book I have ever put down half-read. But I can't imagine why anyone would waste their time or money on it. The ""humor"" is just boring and occasionally disgusting. If the sound of flatulence or the sight of ill-fitting trousers on an obese person drive you into paroxysms of laughter, this book is undoubtedly for you. If you're plagued by subtlety and taste, and your sense of humor admits the odd guilty pleasure, I suggest instead The Liar, by Stephen Fry: http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=156947012"
5,Understanding the greatest comic character in modern literature,"Length:: 8:05 MinsThis is a highly acclaimed comic novel, and a lot of people think it's hilarious. Despite the fact that Ignatius is not a 'nice' person the reader can relate to, he IS a complex creature of paradox, and we can at least empathize with him - as long as we understand him. This video review is devoted to such an understanding - an outline of the plot (in form, not content), the main character, his themes, and his various styles of humor."
3,"Great for those who enjoy dark, absurd comedy","I am not a big fan of dark comedy, so this book is three stars for me, but I still acknowledge ""Confederacy of Dunces"" as a very unique book.If you enjoy reading about the misadventures of largely unsympathetic characters (as many do), you will find few books that do it as well as this one. On the other hand, just to warn readers whose tastes tend more toward mine, if you like to have a protagonist with whom you can truly empathize in order to feel fully absorbed in a story, this one may not be for you.A very good book that isn't for everyone. (Then again, how many books achieve greatness trying to be everything to everyone?) This book knows what it wants to be and does it well. I just wasn't the right reader."
4,Ignatius may be one of the most colorful characters to ever,"populate a novel.One wonders how much O'Toole patterned his desperately comic hero after his own existence, prior to his suicide before the book was ever published.There is a wealthy of literary caricature here, along with the flavor of N'Awlins, complete with its colorful denizens. Ignatius' run-in with the world of gays and lesbians at a consciousness-raising political rally he holds is a chapter of sheer insanity.Although I much preferred the quietly unique characters such as Officer Mancuso, and the love of Ignatius' life, the ornery Myrna, Ignatius and his mother are truly one of the most odd couples to ever grace the page of an American novel. Always colorful and entertaining, Toole's novel delights, although, in my opinion, it fell short of what standard I believe should be achieved for a Pulitzer.Hundreds of reviewers can't be wrong - read ""A Confederacy of Dunces"", particularly if you've ever lived in the deep south!"
5,Tourist in New Orleans,This is one of the very best books I've read in a long time! You'll especially enjoy it if you're familiar at all with New Orleans.
5,best book ever!!!,"this book is so original, hilarious, at times a little heartbreaking just because you can feel the character's raw emotions. so well done, a must read"
1,One of the worst books I've ever read.,"Confederacy of Dunces is one of the worst books I've ever read. It certainly did not live up to its billing. I found the book dated, and lacking humor in today's society (that of course assumes it was humorous when it was written). The humor is distasteful and offensive. There is nothing madcap about the adventures of Ignatious Reilly--he is simply a pathetic overweight individual. I am sorry that I wasted money buying this book."
1,Not a single redeming character,My book club read this book and all eight of us hated it. The characters are disgusting and they are not funny in the least. Quirky characters in novels are usually entertaining but there was not a SINGLE redeeming character in any of this book's characters. Do not bother with this novel.
3,Who thought this was Pulitzer material?,"I find ACoD mildly amusing, but I'm still puzzled by why someone thought it deserved literature's highest prize."
1,I no longer have respect for the Pulitzer,"This book was passed on to me by a friend who stopped reading it halfway through because it so annoyed her. Turns out I almost chucked the book at the same place but doggedly slogged through thinking there would be a payoff that justified the Pulitzer. It never got any better. All I can say it must have been a slow book year, akin to giving an academy award to a 60's beach party movie. It is the WORST book I've ever read. The characterizations were were stereotypical and offensive, the plot was banal, and the characters themselves (with the minor exception of the ever-suffering cop) lacked any quality that made one care what happened to any of them. If you've lived a very sheltered life (and the author apparently lived with his mother and didn't the house until he committed suicide) this may seem funny; I felt that I wasted time that could have otherwise been spent reading a GOOD book."
1,A Farce on Mankind,"First off, the book is hideous. A novel to glorify the weakness of mankind. This is the first book I have ever thrown in the trash. I could not disgrace the various authors of my collection by placing this novel on the shelf.The comedy of this book is in it's reviews. To glorify this novel is to glorify disparity, vulgarity, and despair. If these reviews were written as a joke on mankind, the least the reviewers could have done was credit the proper reviewer...Ellsworth Toohey.It's not even good drivel. It's a poor, vulgar rendition of Catch-22 without plot or character development.Anyone who knows who Ellsworth Toohey is or can answer the following question will find nothing but frustration and disgust in this novel.Who is John Galt?"
1,Read John Irving instead,"I love characters that fly in the face of conventionality. I love irreverant characters who challenge the way we see the world.Ignatius is neither of these. His rantings on the ills of society from the safety of his bedroom in his mother's house were empty and silly. He is a completely unbelievable character, or at least one with whom I could not empathize. His twisted view of the world is so anathema to the realm of common experience that I'm surprise anyone can put themselves in it.Try as hard as I did, I couldn't raise enough interest in the characters to even finish this book.Read John Irving instead -- He's much funnier, can turn reality in interesting twists and still be believable, and has more important things to say about what it is to be a human being in the world."
1,Couldn't slog through this one,"I keep reading how wonderful this tome is. I keep hearing how it is a classic. I have tried upon three separate occasions to get through this mess of a book. The main character is no one to whom I can relate.After my final VALIANT attempt all the way up to about page 200.......I GAVE UP. Perhaps the artsy set thinks this is wonderful literature.I think the Emperor has no clothes.WHAT am I missing by not appreciating this work? NOT MUCH, methinks."
1,Perhaps the worst book that I've ever read,I read this when it first came out and hated it. I could not understand what the fuss was about so continued my excruciating reading to the bitter end. The main character is repulsive and un-engaging. Twenty years later a very intelligent and witty friend told me that it was his favorite book and I read it again to see what I'd missed. Nothing. I now think considerably less of my friend.
1,Don't Bother,"This book was one of the worst books I have read reciently. The book could have been two sentences...There is a fat guy who suffers from dillustions of grandure. Go read Don Quito if you want a funny version of this story... An all around bad book with only one plot device, and a main character that I could neithor love nor hate because he was a completely flat character. It is a good thing that this author only wrote one book because this way less people will waste money on his flat characters in his boring stories."
1,Overrated Tripe,"I have read many books about nothing and enjoyed the majority of them. However, this rambling opus has a poorer center of gravity than its protagonist. The humor is pedestrian at best and the characters, sparsely drawn, wilt in the New Orleans heat. This is just another fine example of how book awards in general are misguided endorsements of sub-par work. There is a very good reason why this book was rejected by various publishers...it isn't very good. Toole casts a very large net, but catches very few fish in his attempt to capture an incendiary and convoluted period in American life. It appears that Toole is making an attempt at clever historical fiction, but shrouds the work in ludicrousness in order to hide its short comings and general failings."
2,Dull and Unfunny,"Well, after reading a host of rave reviews I decided to give this book a whirl. Supposedly a comedy, I cannot recall laughing once during it, and with a wholly predictable story it failed to delilver. The only saving grace is a good ending, but the build up to it was oh so dreary."
4,Simply very funny,"All I can say is that I was reading this book late one evening on my apartment balcony and I had to come back inside, because I was laughing so hard I started disturbing the neighbors. I'm not one to laugh out loud, but with this book, I just couldn't help it."
3,Good for a few laughs,"I'll admit to chuckling at times while reading this book, but in my opinion it's far from the greatest comic novel ever written as some make it out to be. Toole's representation of the lower strata of New Orleans society was more effective to me than the exaggerated humor represented by I.J. Reilly. About half way through the novel, Reilly started to wear thin on me, and I garnered more amusement from some of the secondary characters, like the factory owner and his wife, and Reilly's radical girlfriend. A CONFEDERACY OF DUNCES is not a bad novel, and had Toole not taken his own life, he could well have become a major author, but for humor, writers like Roth, Irving, Heller, West, and Vonnegut, are more to my taste."
4,"Funny, juvenile, Goofy !","This is a story about a very weird bunch of characters. Reading this was kind of like watching 40 year old virgin and Benny hill goofyness. Some of the comedy is moronic and strange but this book was hilarious. The guy who wrote this must have been one strange individual. He couldn't get his book published and killed himself. Then his mother took the manuscript and got it published and it won a pulizter! LMAO. I enjoyed reading it, but you have to take this book in the context its written in. It is meant to be a goofy, juvenile ridiculous book. If you cant read something like that don't bother you won't like this book. The main character is something else. HE IS VERY WEIRD!"
2,"Excellent book, but","I thoroughly enjoyed reading the book in print; however, readers from Louisiana and especially the New Orleans area should beware of the unabridged recorded version. This city has many many idiosyncratic pronunciations of street names, etc., French as well as Native American, (e.g., Tchoupitoulas St.). The recorded version is rife with mispronunciations, which is a real distraction to readers from that area. The New Orleans accent is also unique to the South, and it is this reader's fondest wish that those who record books about southern Louisiana be more careful in recruiting native Orleanian or Cajun readers, or at least long-time residents of those areas in order to have the accent be more authentic."
5,"The Question is Not, ""Was it Funny?""","It seems that half the reviews of this book together form a collective discussion of whether the book is ""funny"" or not. This argument misses the point. While the book is darkly humorous, that alone wouldn't make it a great book, which it is.The simple fact is that this is a fantastic, American novel. It deals with the classic American themes of freedoms, race, ambition, and self-definition. It rises above exploiting stereotypes and actually explores them. It adds something to psychology instead of haphazardly and incoherently borrowing from it, as so many other novels do.Don't read this book ""because it's funny;"" Read it because it is a great book."
5,Warning to the reader,"Ignatius Reilly is an over-educated medievalist philosopher who lives with his mom and can't seem to hold a job. He is also quite possibly the most entertainingly original character in all of American literature. His misadventurous exploits are unlike anything you can possibly imagine, and if you aren't careful you'll laugh so hard that you'll hurt yourself."
4,"The book ""A Confederacy of Dunces""","This book was mentioned on a TV program and sounded interesting. I don't believe I have ever read about or known such a disgusting, obnoxious, pitiful and intelligent character as Ignatious. The author certainly had a marvelous imagination...too bad he did not live long enough to see this book published."
3,I'm Not In Love With This Book,"I haven't finished reading this book on my Kindle yet. Probably the reason I haven't finished is because I'm having a hard time getting into the story. Maybe it will get better or maybe it won't. I'm not sure.Another thing that is hampering my ""liking"" this book is that I just finished ""Beat The Reaper"" and loved it. Great book that I also read on my Kindle."
3,dunce,his main character rambled on over and over. book could have been 1/3 less. also+knowing how he went on to live his life and end it ' i thought the book sounded like the life he was going to live--and that was so sad to me/
3,Bizarre,"I have no idea why I liked this book. The main character was a dispicable cad, slob, and so on. And yes, just as the title indicates, everybody around him were just plain stupid! I guess I liked it because I am so glad I am smarter, and nicer, than everybody in the book. I thoroughly enjoyed the setting in New Orleans, and, though it was set 50 years ago, I could easily envision places described in the book."
3,Funny but irritating,"In Confederacy of Dunces, 30-year old Ignatius J. Reilly is put upon to exit the safety of his snug (though trashed) bedroom of his mother's home and find a job. The result is a cause-and-effect satire which is (apparently) a monument of American Literature. I didn't really like it. It simply wasn't my kind of book. Don't get me wrong, I got a few laughs...and I can understand how people with a certain sense of humor (those who love cause-and-effect satires like Seinfeld or those who like laughing at the inadequacies and hypocrisies of humanity) would really enjoy this book. It also has a little Freudian satire in it. I just found the characters really annoying (I know I was supposed to). Couldn't get into it."
5,Greatest Satirical Work Ever,No words can describes this...hahahahahaha!! I just can not stop laughing man!! JAJAJAJAJAJa!!
2,Just not funny.,"I came across this book amidst many recommendations on how laugh-out-loud funny it is, and have always been bowled over whenever I've reasd a Pulitzer Prize winner. I really wanted it to be funny, and I could see these ridiculous scenarios building up to their humorous climax in anticipation, but they quite simply weren't funny. I get what the author was going for - this absurd, delusional, quixotic train-wreck of a slob in Ignatius. It was a clever book at points (especially Ignatius' writings). I did laugh to myself a couple times, but most of the time, the humor missed the mark for me, and when something tries to be funny and fails over and over it just gets tired.I kept waiting for this to get funny all the way until the end of the book, it just didn't happen. Not a bad book per se, but given the accolades it's received, and the fact that it's a Pulitzer Prize winner, I'm very dissappointed. This is the first time I've ever read a Pulitzer winner and not been really impressed."
2,A Confederavy of Dunces,"This book starts out haltingly, then slows down. Apparently the dunces are those of us who bought it. It violates the first rule of humor - it's not funny. I'll never be able to get back the time I wasted reading it."
3,An okay read,"I thought A Confederacy of Dunces was ok. Although I know many people that really enjoyed the book, I found it to be a little long and repetitive at times. There are many funny parts to the book; I found myself laughing (most of the time in my head, but laughing nonetheless) every now and then, even though a lot of the humor is crude and gross. Ignatius is an interesting and unique character, and I feel Toole did a good job of character development. Every character in the book has their own personality, and they are deep enough as to where the reader feels like they really know them. Along with the comedy in the book, however, Toole slips in a lot of social commentary.If you're looking for a funny read, A Confederacy would be a pretty good choice. It wasn't the best book I've read, but it certainly was not the worst."
2,Not very Enjoyable,"I did not really enjoy this book. Everyone raved about it, but I can't see why. I thought Ignatius Reilly was an annoying, unfunny jerk. I couldn't find anything amusing or interesting. I thought the attempt at humor was forced, obvious and rather pathetic. I could not finish the book because it was torture to read more than half of the book. I wish I could get a refund in all honesty. The prose was the only reason why I gave the book two stars."
3,Strange? Yes. Superbly mad? I think not.,"What a weird and silly book. The writing is flawless, the characters vivid but not necessarily appealing, particularly the manic and obnoxious protagonist, Ignatius J. Reilly. I wonder if Mr. Toole personally knew his way around mania as Mr. Reilly's flights of fancy, while bizarre, ring true.I wish I could remember who recommended this book; I would like to ask her why. I finished it, and I'm not sure why."
1,Each chapter left me feeling a little more sick,Each chapter left me feeling a little more sick to my stomach than the one before. What a waste of reading time.
1,yuck,"I was disgusted by the main character. I was dissappointed by the book. It was not ""outrageously funny"" and all the other praise. It was a let down, and stupid."
1,frustrating and painful,"Although EXTREMELY well written, I couldn't stand the main character - an ignorant, obese, socially inept, genius sloth of an a-hole . . . a frustrating example of what's wrong with human beings, and shows how bad parenting can destroy a society"
1,A Confederacy of Dunces - a novel,"I have read this book before. It is an excellent book. I was either sent the wrong edition or if I was sent the correct edition, the book pages were in very poor condition. The condition of the edition I ordered stated it was in ""Good"" condition but, in fact, all of the pages were brown and looked like they were ready to disintegrate. I was giving this as a gift so though I intend to purchase another, better copy, but I was very disappointed and had to send my friend a poor copy because I wanted him to have it before I went into surgery.The copy I ordered had a different cover on it. The cover pictured all of the crazy characters on it.This is the first time I was disappointed in the quality of a book I have ordered through Amazon.com or Betterworld Books etc. subsideraries.Sincerely,Barbara"
5,An amazing novel,"In a few short pages, Toole had me hooked. The characters were well developed and immediately I was emotionally involved. The lunacy of the situations added to the story as much as the deep descriptions of sights, sounds and locations. What I found most amazing was how timely this novel is. While it was written many years ago, it is a story for our time, with many adult children returning home to the nest. I wouldn't be surprised to find many Irene's out there, just wishing their ""boy"" would ""make good"""
2,Mrs. Rita,I read bits and pieces of this book and what i read wasnt good. The people in the book are weird with strange ideas. Whats up with furtuna? Who is that ? Jones is full of himself and doesn't care about society. He tries to get on a woman on the bus. santa is a ols woman who tries to be young. it wasn't my type of book.
1,When does it get funny?,"4.5 stars with 915 reviews. I expected to really enjoy this book. I am now on page 74 of 415 pages (i.e., 17% of the book). I am still waiting for it to get funny. The book is boring. The characters are unlikable. I doubt I will finish it. I don't understand what it is that everyone finds so funny about this book.At best this book will give your vocabulary a workout. I would give this book zero stars if that was an option."
1,Now I know why Toole kills himself,"As some have reviewed, I was one of those captivated by the prologue. The story of how the book was published is far better than the story itself. I too, found it difficult to pick up this book once it was put down. A mish-mash of vignettes, dream states, and letters by the 'hero' created a mood of boredom and disappointment. The boredom came from this book just not being funny. The disappointment mainly at how much time I was wasting in continuing to read it. I believe in finishing what I started and was determined to the end to give this a chance. The joke was on me. I was the true dunce. In reflection, maybe that's the irony here?"
5,A wonderful comedy,"This book is perhaps the most consistently funny novel I have yet read. Toole had a fine sense of the absurd, wonderful characterization, and a keen ability with language. It is a true pity that this book was his last effort. Arguably, it was his only effort; ""The Neon Bible"", a teenage effort 'discovered' some years later, reads as if it was from a completely different writer. What a loss. (Should I sign this ""Tad, your working boy""? hmm... nah)"
1,Boring Rubbish,"I also was suckered into buying this book based upon some user comments. Hopefully my comments and those of a couple of others here will enable someone else to escape the same fate.In summary, this book is boring rubbish!The characterisations are good but that is all this entire book has going for it -- the story is bland and boring. We do not care one iota for any of the characters.However, with great determination I struggled through the whole book in the vain hope that some element in the story would make the exercise worthwhile. But no, reading this book was a complete waste of time."
2,over rated,"Indeed this book has some genius in it, on the whole I thought it was just a little too much and I can't understand why there are those who think this is a great book. How can this book be mentioned along with Don Quixote? Miguel de Cervantes was a great novelist."
1,For the simple minded.,"If you like your stories and plot simple and direct and sophomoric 'Three Stooges' like humor, this book is for you."
1,The Best Way To Lose Your Appetite,"One doesn't need appetite suppresents when thinking of the protagonist of this lugubrious overwritten dirge. I couldn't help but wonder if the dunces referred only to the characters in the novel, or to those who paid for it as well.There is no beauty, insight, meaning or reason for this book. Avoid. Unless you crave the grotesque."
1,Now I'm not even sure I want my Masters in English anymore!,A bristling manifesto that attests to the dangers of being over-educated.
1,Include me out,"I needed an audio book to listen to while commuting, and during the first two disks I was certain I'd found the perfect one: ""Confederacy ..."" was ROFLMAO funny. But by the end of end of disk 3 the antics produced only smiles, and when it came time to change to disk 5, Ignatius and most of the other characters were either so annoying or so over-the-top that I didn't care what happened to any of them.One positive: the narrator of the audio version, Barrett Whitener, is superb. He must have created 15-20 different voices, each was unique and ideally suited for the character's personality, especially Ignatius'."
3,"Great character, mediocre plot","I know A CONFEDERACY OF DUNCES is a classic, has won tons of awards, and is some people's favorite book of all time, but I found myself underwhelmed. Ignatius was original and a lot of the writing was hilarious, but the plot was so clunky and uninteresting that I spent a lot of time wondering where the book was going. I tried to give Toole the benefit of the doubt, but over time even Ignatius and his little stories became repetitive. I grew bored reading about a character without any real plot to bring it all together. When I finally got to the climax I had a 'this is it?' reaction."
4,"I Didn't Laugh That Much, But Maybe It Was The Hype","When I was first told about A Confederacy of Dunces it was described as a laugh riot. So when I read the book and only chuckled a couple of times I was dissappointed. The book didn't live up to its hype.The ending was quite good and I liked how the individual stories of each of the characters came together in the end. As a matter of fact, the ending alone is worth the price of the book (Myrna and Ignatius deserve each other).I found myself feeling embarrased for Ignatius throughout this book. After Toole described him, I felt like I had to go take a shower. Any other who can inspire that kind of response is worth a read."
2,Non-magical Unrealism,"Caveat: I only made it 5 hours into the book before predictability and repetition wore me down.The author's keen observation is blunted by a writing style that leaves every character two-dimensional.Neither plot nor interior life is engaging.The Audible.com narrator is marvelous, making the characters and story as vivid as possible."
3,Disappointing,"Try as I might, I could not enjoy this novel. It came highly recommended to me. I just found Ignatius slothful, overly onanistic, self-righteous, and elitist. I kept waiting for some great revelation or some insightful commentary, but I was left with the feeling that I had spent too much time with a man who I would never want to know in real life. Ignatius was sold to me by the person who recommended the book as a modern Don Quixote, but I found none of Quixote's endearing character traits in Ignatius. There was something noble about Don Quixote's blind devotion to his quest. I can't recall anything noble about Ignatius. Maybe that was Toole's point. Maybe his novel is a commentary on modern man's wretched condition. If so, I was too disgusted with Ignatius to notice."
2,hard time laughing at characters who invoke pity,"I realize I'm in the minority, as everyone seems to LOVE this book, and finds it MOST amusing. I picked it up based on several recommendations, read close to 3/4 of it waiting for the laughter-invoking part to begin, and it never happened... Can't even make myself finish the book."
4,John Waters Meets F. Scott Fitzgerald,"This is an oddly enjoyable book. If the film maker John Waters were to write a literary comic-drama, it would be like this. The dialogue is hilariously self-conscious and over-dramatic; the setting is appropriately tacky. Yet all this is accomplished as a sensitive critique of 1960's southern culture. Ignatius J. Reilly's ravings against modern society are both interesting and humorous. It is not an exciting book, but I greatly enjoyed it."
5,"Without a doubt, the best book I have ever read!",To review it would be to ruin it. It is a masterpiece
3,Tragically Hip?,"This book was well written enough to keep my attention -- barely. However, I wish I had not been informed of Mr. Toole's demise until afterward. I couldn't comprehend that this work, as good as it was, was worthy of one's life. Knowledge of Toole's suicide and his mother's quest to get the work published was a compelling story worthy of its own book. Unfortunately, the foreword cast a pall over the book that suggested the novel had to be so great that the author's death was more than it really was -- a tragic suicide -- and therefore worthy of a Pulitzer, no less.I wish Toole had developed the Levys more in my opinion. They were more fascinating than Ignatius, his mom, Santa Battaglia, Angelo and Claude put together.Furthermore, is anyone else of the impression that the comic book store owner on the cartoon show The Simpson's was modeled after our friend Ignatius?"
5,Top Notch!,"Medieval Philosophy! Contemporary Social Criticism! Non-Stop Laughs!...I've read this book three times now, and each time I burst out laughing"
5,A rare blend of hillarious comedy and social insight,"I'm more amazed by the book with each new time I read it. Toole has captured the city of New Orleans and its subcultures like no one I've ever seen. This results in some of the funniest reading I've ever seen, being very thought-provoking at the same time. I don't think you can go wrong reading this book"
5,"A very funny, wonderful story.","I would have to say that this book has been one of my favorites. Not only is is hilarious in every way, but it also makes you think about things."
2,Really?,"I had this book recommended to me by a friend and so I was interested in reading this. Also, I had read a great deal of positive reviews on this. So, I started to read this book rather eagerly expecting that I would be greatly entertained. However, as I got through the first 30 pages, I had to force myself to continue reading. I already despised the main character and had little interest in any of the other characters in the book. This book, unlike other great books, became a chore to read.In its defense, the book does get mildly more interesting as it goes along. This was perhaps its only redeeming quality. I found a couple of incidents in the book mildly amusing. However, having just finished reading this book. I can only recommend that you save yourself the time. This book leaves me feeling that I wasted my time.I'm honestly puzzled that so many people liked this book. It sucks. The only reason I gave it two stars is because certain statements that Ignatius made were mildly amusing."
2,"Good book, bad kindle typsetting.","(This review is for the Kindle version)I wanted to read this again, since I had fond memories of my reading from 20 years ago. Unfortunately the Kindle version's typesetting is distractingly bad. The typeface is not changeable, and changing the size does not really help the problem. It's set in a serif font, and the spaces between the words are all over the place; some of the spaces look like five spaces. The kerning within the words, by contrast, is extremely tight. It just looks bad and does not flow, and it stinks because this book deserves better treatment. I would recommend a print version unless you are very forgiving of bad typesetting.From now on I will always try a sample first, so I can avoid ugly, cheap conversions."
5,"My favorite book of all time. Absolutely brilliant, hilarious, with fantastic characters and world class prose.","""A Confederacy of Dunces"" is my favorite book of all time. Absolutely brilliant, hilarious, with fantastic characters and world class prose. I have also heard that the book has a significant influence on the local lore of New Orleans. They also say that the dialog is a perfect characterization of New Orleans speech."
5,Funny Silly Very enjoyable,Confederacy is absurdly funny. Life is filled with people like Ignatius and his mom. They create texture and interest.Let's face it - we all have our foibles and quirks.Looking at life through Ignatius' eyes is entertaining but I also feel how he struggles to live everyday life.There are many levels to this wonderful book.
4,good book,This was the first book we picked for our co-ed book club. It is a good read and offeres many areas to discuss.
5,What a TERRIBLE thing to say Mr. Gallen! (previous reviewer),"Imagine...someone saying such an awful thing (Mr. Gallen's review). Mr. Gallen, I am glad that you are not in charge of the publishing world!I almost never read fiction, but a close friend asked me to read ""Confederacy"". I laughed MORE reading this book than I did when reading ""Catcher in the Rye"" twenty years ago! I have since recommended this book to many people, ALL of whom would agree with me. Sophomoric, and even grotesque at times...this is truly a very funny read! I couldn't put it down and read the entire book in one day. The hardcover edition offered here is a bargain, but the softcover is a little larger size and bigger type font making it a little more comfortable to read through."
3,Better off reading it if you can,"I love this book. It has such a potential for great accents in the reading, but I'm baffled by this performance. I grew up in New Orleans, and only a few of the accents sound vaguely authentic. It's really distracting for someone who knows them already, and really misleading for someone that doesn't."
5,A Confederacy Of Dunces,It has been a great read. It was delievered on time & in excellent shape. I have wanted to read this book for many years & it is now a proud member of my personal library. Thank you!!
3,meh,This book was recommended to me by a professor at a university. I really thought it would get better once I started understanding all the characters. In reality I wanted to meet the main character and punch him in the face. He is not a lovable character or one that learns his lesson in the end. I did enjoy the description of the setting and could actually hear these characters come to life in my head.
4,not bad!,"At first I couldn't decide whether I loved this book or hated it. Now, having quickly turned the pages, finding I couldn't put it down, and finishing it in two weekdays, I think I like it! I don't particularly like the characters (these are not the kind of people I would want to be friends with) but found them fascinating to observe in a reality television fishbowl kind of way. The fact that there is no plot per se, was actually fine with me. I just read the book as a series of misadventures and enjoyed the ride. The characterizations and absurdities brought to mind Catch-22 and Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas.The dialogue is quite clever and the dialects superb. It's unfortunate Toole didn't live to continue his writing career."
3,"a classic, but a bit outdated","The publishing world has been shamelessly promoting this award winning book -- I enjoyed it, but I didn't think it was quite as much of a hoot as many critics must have. Sure, I laughed at Ignatius' over-active sphincter and his total loser personality, but after a few hundred pages of his manic thoughts, I begain to tire of him. yes, I think the book is a classic, but once you're over the main part of the story, I doubt you'll roll in the aisles laughing. Maybe I'm a heathen, but I laughed much more at every Dave Barry book."
2,double edged sword - tiresome,"Both camps are right about this book. It is both funny and annoying. The people who think it's funny, love the laughs and ignore the fact that there is virtually no story. The people who hate it, don't. I laughed for about a hundred pages and then the book falls into tiresome repetition- Surface activity with no point. The protagonist is someone none of the reviewers would spend five minutes with. I couldn't make it past page 150 or so. A more interesting story would inviestigate how the publisher used word-of-mouth about the authors suicide as a marketing tool, allowing fans to credit themselves with coolness for finding this ""underground"" hit."
2,Sometimes humour just doesnt translate,"John Kennedy Toole is a fine sophisticated writer of that there is no doubt. His turn of phrase is descriptive and vivid and his clarity of expression is a pleasure to read. His Pulitzer prize was earned and deserved in my opinion. However, sometimes humour and other charactistics of story telling, which is what this book definitely is, just don't cross borders. While I could appreciate the talent of the writer in an abstract manner, the story did nothing to entertain me. I was basically left unsatisfied and rather replused by much of the story, due, I am sure, to the inability of a non-american to relate to a very colloquial and private joke."
1,I guess you have to have been there,"If this book was awarded the pulitzer for generating emotion in the reader then it deserves the award. Unfortunately, for me it was nausea. The lead character embodied everything about modern America that I find repulsive. Grossly fat, completely self indulgent, narrowly educated, blaming all on others, and completely disfunctional. Yuck! This book will appeal to those who enjoy the pratfalls of the Three Stooges. No joy, no hope, no sense. Stupidity and insanity are not funny."
1,ho-hum humor,"Can't resist adding a note of dissent to the overwhelming chorus of praise this book has received over the years. ""Humorous,"" I suppose, but in a very broad, Vaudevillian way, where you see the joke coming from so far away that when it lands it causes a groan of impact, not a laugh. If you enjoy slapstick--the verbal equivalent of ""Police Academy"" movies--this may be the book for you, but I found it tired, strained, banal."
1,"""Ulysses"" - only with punctuation",To paraphrase someone else's comment: an emperor with no clothes - possibly better than one with. I can only think he won the Pulitzer out of the committee's mis-guided sympathy for a seriously disturbed mother.
1,Baffled by the high praise for this book,"I can honestly say that I don't understand what the other reviewers who give this high marks see in it, especially when they call those who don't like it ""humor-impaired"". Ignatius is pompous, narcissistic, and boorish, but just having those qualities doesn't make him funny - an author has to do something with a character like that, and Toole doesn't (at least through the first half, after which I gave up because it just got too boring). He and his mother are much like the characters on Desperate Housewives: having no redeeming qualities that might inspire even a slight bit of sympathy or relating, yet not evil or noxious enough to generate antipathy and interest to see how they might meet some kind of downfall. Instead you just wish they'd go away and stop bothering you. But then, I guess there are people who like Desperate Housewives too."
1,HAD TO FORCE MY SELF TO FINISH THIS ONE,I didn't find this book at all interesting or amusing. The characters were unrealistic. There was no plot. There was nothing funny about it. I forced my self to finish this one. But I consider it a waste of time.
1,Agree to disagree,"I struggled through this as it was recommended by a friend (and had won a major award). I didn't find it either hysterical or humorous - mostly inane. The only humor being the reality tv sort. If you enjoy watching (or reading about) train wrecks, this might be for you. I know I'm in the minority, but I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone."
1,I'm curious. . .,"I would like to know what percentage of the people who gave this book a 5 also said that ""There's Something About Mary"" was the funniest movie they've ever seen. Both of these creations exist on a subcultural, subhuman level."
3,great first half but became a drag,"ignatius character is brilliantly portrayed. his pompous language and the trouble he finds himself in are hilarious. however, the story becomes quickly a joke repeated again and again. there is no development of characters or at least those are flawed. i did enjoy the book and i would be definetely rereading some of the parts involving ignatius but i do not share the same enthusiasm with all who gave it 5 stars."
5,"'he's got a hard road, boy!'",this book haunts. in the best possible way. iknow it's a work of fiction but there are times when iwonder where ignatius is and what's going on around him. beautiful.
5,five stars are not enough,"Easily the funniest book I have ever read. If you enjoyed Tortilla Flat, Catch-22, and Dilbert, this book will make you howl. Toole's eyes were certainly open. (and closed too soon.)"
5,Absolutely Astounding!,Ignatius J. Reilly is alive and well and living all over this country! Such a masterful character who is rarely encountered with such depth and reality. We are all the poorer for John Kennedy Toole's early demise.
4,A sustained comedy but the genius is in the plotting,"It is hard to enjoy an entire book of ridiculous ranting and hysteria. Reilly's outbursts grow tiresome and repetitive. He maintains the same one-note level of disgust and anger throughout the book, and any personal growth that he achieves tends to be physical rather than spiritual or philosophical. British readers may find Reilly a mixture of several comic characters from Viz magazine - Spoiled Brat, Mr Brain - but Toole's real skill is in creating the various plot threads and drawing them together and flinging them apart at will. I was truly delighted that Ignatius gets away at the end of the book to wreak further havoc. What a pity that the author didn't."
5,Laff riot,"I read ten pages every time I go to visit my mother and sister. It is so good I do not want it to end. I am one-third through it. I have to stop from laughing out loud and disturbing the tranquility of the house. If I bought my own copy and read it in my own home, I would finish it too soon and the dream/nightmare would be over. Reading the reviews would open that valve wide on Mr. Ignatius. If only there were more like him. Funniest book I ever read. Catch-22 is not on this level of absurdity. And the crudity works."
5,A Confederacy of Dunces,"Pulitzer prize winning author, too bad he wasn't alive to receive his prize. Just think of all the other great books Toole could have written if he were still alive."
5,A character to love or hate,"Nothing quite falls flatter than failed comedy. I've read several critical reviews here that claimed that this book was hideously unfunny. Now I could not disagree more with that sentiment. I found this book to be brilliantly funny, as satire sometimes can be. Not funny in the same way an Adam Sandler movie wants to be, but more like a Twain or Vonnegut adventure, where the human condition is unceremoniously revealed to be comically grandiose in its own self-delusions.Once you get to know Ignatius and his pals, you'll be glad you stayed on for a bit. He remains one of the great characters of fictional literature. Many a writer could learn something from how carefully and completely he is deveolped throughout the book. I found it a joy to read, and I will soon read it again."
5,What a GREAT Book!,I found the main character to be HIGHLY amusing. This book is very unusual and well written. I would recommend it anyone that likes a good read...The story about how this book was discovered is interesting as well.
5,Richly textured and fall-down hilarious,"This is that rare book that lives up to its cult status on every grotesque page. From the first line to the last, this breathless tour de force weaves an intricate story that never ceases to satisfy and delight. Ignatius, his mother, and the other dozen or more characters at the center of the book are so fully-formed and human that their outrageous behavior and exasperation at life seem so fresh and real that it feels like it's happening to you. Even if you're one of those well-read brainiacs who's grown weary of ""must-read"" suggestions from us amateurs, do yourself a favor and discover the day that Ignatius emerges from his home to buy a new string for his lute. You'll return to this book again and again."
5,Funniest Book Ever!!!,"A CONFEDERACY OF DUNCES is decidedly a modern classic. If you know New Orleans, it's like being there. If you don't know New Orleans, you'll finally know what that corner of heaven is like! Full of the best dunces on earth."
2,you have to be kidding,good literature? NOT......did not find much humorous about this novel....I think hero may have had Asbergers!Not worth wasting my time reading past the 200 pages I read in hopes it would stop its ridiculousness.
3,Don't buy into the hype,"Worthy of a Pultizer? Not in my opinion. But I have read much worse. Over all, mildly amusing and kind of sad with one or two laugh-out-loud moments. A fair read, but I would only suggest it for those who have an interest in reading modern works that lean toward the literary."
3,"Lovely writing, story meandered","I give this book 3.5 stars.Beautifully drawn characters. Lovely writing. Great ideas. I found the story a little bogged down in the middle and almost gave up on it a few times. I persevered but never really got the same high I got when reading the first few chapters. As believable as I found the characters, towards the end, I felt hyper-aware of what the author was trying to do structurally and unfortunately for me this catapulted me out of Iganatius' world and into my own.I think this would work beautifully as a film or serial.And despite my star rating, I think it is a book worth reading."
4,Not as good as Handling Sin...,"This book is always recommended for those who liked ""Handling Sin,"" a book I read about 15 years ago and continue to reread with great enjoyment. I've just finished my first reading of Mr. Toole's book and can see only three similarities:1. Both books take place in the South2. Both are full of kooky characters3. The writing style is very lyrically similar.This was an entertaining book but a short one, taking about 3.5 hours to read. I do recommend it but it probably won't be a reread for me; none of the characters engaged my sympathy except Jones, and it's not worth rereading for Jones' part.I do recommend ""Handling Sin"" very highly if you haven't read it. It's a much longer read - maybe 5-6 hours or more if you speed through it - and more intricate, IMHO."
1,Definitely not funny.,"Front to back terrible. I bought it because I wanted a book that was funny rather than boring old serious and a friend recommended it, but it really just isn't actually funny. To be fair, if you find yourself often saying, ""Oh that is too much!"" or ""Oh that is clever!"" then you might be exactly the kind of person who will force yourself into finding this stack of toilet paper funny."
2,weird book,This book was weird but lacked sense. It was like read a story that tried to be fuuny but was just sad.
3,pretty funny,A Confederacy of Dunces is a pretty funny book. It never made me laugh out loud but i rarely luagh out loud from reading a book. The main character Ignatius J. Reilly is outraegous and absurd. His ridiculous actions make him the funniest character out of any book ive ever read. Ignatius's character is what makes this book work. The author did a great job developing Ignatius's character. When you read this book you want to keep reading to find out what kind of crazy ridiculous things he is going to do next. Ignatius just kind of wanders around in his own little world not really doing much of anything and he ends up in some pretty funny and ridiculous adventures. Ignatius is a very grotesque and disguisting person so the humor in the book is also very grotesque and disguisting. People who do not like grotesque humor may not find this book to be very funny but i enjoyed the type of humor and i thought this book was good.
5,Can't Put It Down!!!!!!,"It takes a genius to write a character like Ignatius J. Reilly THIS well! This is such a brilliantly funny book, I could not put it down when I first read it at the age of 16, and each subsequent time. I've read it in 2 languages and in both cases I couldn't tear myself away! It's hilarious on many different levels! It's psychological comedy! I lent it to a friend who is a clinical Psychologist, and then to my mother, neither one could put it down either!"
5,Classic Confederacy,"This book should be considered a ""classic!"" I have never laughed out loud as hard as I did while reading this book. Everything from the characters to their series of comedic events had me in hysterics. The story focuses on the pathetic ""dunce"" of a man, Ignatius J. Reilly. This thirty year old (well-educated) man, who is completely dependent upon his mother, is forced to get a job. Every job he has, somehow, seems to interfere with his very busy life of doing nothing. Although he has a master's degree, he finds thoughtless, thankless jobs that he can't hold onto. His on-the-job blunders and his desire to change society as well as his interactions with the other characters make this the funniest book I have ever read. I would definitely recomend it to anyone who wants a good laugh!"
1,"God, how I hated this book","I bought this thing on the recommendation of a friend (who is one no longer) to read while traveling. I never finished it because it was so bad. It reads like very, very bad Vonnegut. It is not funny in the slightest. This is another example of things that are popular for no apparent reason."
2,Much better books that mix humor and social commentary.,"My friend had been badgering me for months to read this book and recommended it to our face-to-face bookgroup. I am an avid reader and love satire, humor, and farce as much as anyone, but this book did not do a thing for me. While there are humorous segments in this book, I never once busted a gut laughing or even laughed out loud. Ignatious was obnoxious, which I guess was what he was supposed to be, but if he was attempting to open our eyes to the superficialities of life, he did not succeed. I never really understood just what he DID stand for. I thought it probably pretty autobiographical and can understand how Toole may have ended his life if he in any way identified with his character. Sad, yes. Some redeeming value--maybe. Funny-not!! If you want a read that combines humor, satire, social commentary and anything else you can think of and really want to laugh may I suggest anything by John Irving."
2,Disappointing abridgement,"Arte Johnson gives a wonderful interpretation of the characters' voices and accents. However, the development of Ignatious' personality suffers greatly due to the severity of the abridgement. The plot thread is retained, but many amusing asides and some of the more colorful vocabulary are missing. I would not recommend the audio cassette to anyone who has not read the original version of this exceptional novel."
2,One of the most overrated books in history.,"Written with style. Toole definitely had talent, but it takes more than vivid descriptions to make a great book. I found the book utterly depressing. It gave me the feeling I get after a David Lynch film, like I need to take a shower. I kept trudging through it because I had heard such good things, but the good things never came. (...) How can so many people love this book so much? I guess the world would be pretty boring if we all agreed on everything."
1,A revelation,"I started this book twice (I stopped to read another book) and after reading about 100 pages, I still don't like it but I think I have a revelation.Most reviews of this book say how ""hilarious"" and ""gut-bustingly"" funny it is. I don't think it's funny at all; I don't think it was intended to be funny. I think the author created a character based on himself and this is how he saw the world. Ignatius seems to have major mental issues and is seriously detached from real life. His behavior isn't comical or quirky, it seems to border on insanity. I don't really understand the appeal of this book filled with unappealing characters."
2,Where's the Beef?,"I have to agree with P.J. Otto of St.Louis on this one. What is the author trying to tell us; that fat, eccentric, neurotic personality-disordered individuals are funny? A sociological lession? Political satire?Much of the dialogue is clever but redundant. It becomes predictable after a few pages. Ignitius is never personalized. Throughout the book he remains a character construct. A hyperbolized combination of responses.If there is a great humanizing message here, it is inapprehendable by me. Without a redeeming message, the story is too quirky and uninteresting.A book that is overrated by virtue of too many people propelled by the momentum of a desire to see what has been seen by others."
5,hilarious and heartbreaking,"This is the greatest contemporary book I've ever read. It's a kaleidoscope of complicated characters, a bewildering city, and wisdom. While reading this book I found myself laughing-outloud and tearing-up simultaneously."
2,"Funny, but.....","I had heard so much hype about how great this book was - a ""bastion of great literature"" masquerading as a comic masterpiece - so was quite excited to read it. I ended up finding the book funny....but that's about it. True, the main character was well-developed and brimming with pathology and the story kept me interested enough, but I was expecting some earth-shattering climax, a heartwrenching denouement....I mean, it did win a Pulitzer after all, no?The bottom line - the characters were funny (though their personal interactions not as satisfying as I had hoped), the plot moderately entertaining and the ending a little bit of a let down. I would recommend this if you just wanted a laugh or two, but wouldn't make it your next ""must read""."
3,Don Quijote meets Tales of the City,"I finished this book with mixed emotions; it had me alternately laughing and annoyed. What makes this book brilliant is also its downfall: its nonstop (and sometimes tiresome) literary and cultural allusions. The protagonist's worldview is a mishmash of Roman philosophy, medieval literature, and a passionate contempt for the bourgeoisie. An unsuccessful hot dog vendor with an elite university education, Ignatius J. Reilly bumbles through New Orleans in a series of adventures and mishaps that put him squarely at odds with the authorities and mainstream society. The author asks a lot of the reader, however, by sharing Ignatius's every belch and moment of flatulence. If you are can get past the slow beginning, you'll probably enjoy the rest. It's a clever satire, and sometimes leaves you laughing out loud. Unlike anything else you'll read."
1,an awful book,"I have tried to read this book 3 times. Every time someone praises it as the best book they have ever read, I try again. I didn't care what happened to Ignatius and can't see any redeeming qualities, either in him or in the story itself. Each to their own I guess."
1,Very disappointing book,"I had been told what a wonderful and funny book this was. I found it neither. I found none of the characters sympathetic and didn't really care what happened to them. I kept thinking there was a deeper purpose for the book, namely social commentary, but it was a tedious, definitely not funny way to receive the message.Not worth reading.Gail Switzer"
2,Could not get into it,"This book is good for many reasons and bad for many others. The characters are brilliantly thought out and he combines plots and situations very well. The statements that he makes about society in his own way are amusing and very poignant.That being said, I was expecting funny. Perhaps I have a horrible sense of humor, but I never thought I did. I didn't laugh out loud; I hardly thought the situation were funny. I tried to picture them actually happening visually, and I guess that was kind of funny, but still didn't do much for me. The characters are largely unlikeable and I didn't find myself caring about any of them; thus, I really could not get into this novel.Try it out if you want, but don't pay full price at Borders as I did."
3,Bragh! - SJ,"Interesting Book. Tough to digest it if you don't understand the many jokes. I must say, Toole's Confederacy of Dunces was entertaining. It definitely is a Confederacy of Dunces against Reilly in my opinion. No one understands the old soul's ideas in his modern world. He wants to revolutionize the industry, the world, the universe and no one understands him. It is unfortunate that he does not understand the time that he is in. The novel is definitely an original, and it is unfortunate that Toole was not able to see it published in his life time. Read it in a quiet atmosphere when you have a chance and you will find yourself laughing out loud."
3,Strange book,"Funny in parts. Weird in parts. Sometimes I asked myself why I was reading this; other times I felt compelled to read more. Can't see that it could be called ""great literature"" but at the same time I found myself thinking about the characters when I wasn't reading. Strange."
2,"Tears and laughter -- a tragic, gut, wrenching comedy.","This book is a paradox. Enigmatic. Percy's characterization is perfect: Where the tragedy comes from is a mystery. Not so with the comedy. Read it. Or, start reading--the book will take care of the rest. Toole killed himself at the foot of the street I live on in Biloxi, MS. I wish I could have been there when he looped the garden hose from the exhaust pipe through the window into the car. I would have begged him not to give in to the depression. To write, more. Much, much more."
2,Large Print Dunced,I love this book and wanted to give my 93 yr young housemate the chance to read it.This large print WAS NOT large at all.I then had to buy her a magnifying glass.
4,What great dialog!,"Tiny print, but worth the eye strain. Great conversations in this book, funny, intelligent. Hard to think of a charachter that disgusts as much as Ignatious."
3,"Comic, but does not keep me engaged to the end","While this novel was comical and the writing flows, the story never goes anywhere from that point on. It just keeps going and going and things seem to stay the same until the very end. It is essentially a single thought played out with almost no variations until the very end. It was an enjoyable read until maybe one third of the book. The author probably should've ended it there. Three stars."
2,Why?,I read this for our book club- and it has been my least favorite book so far - felt like a complete waste of time - yes the story was at least interesting at parts - but overall felt like a waste of time.
2,Where's the humor?,"I kept waitin for this book to become funny, interesting or even mildly amusing. I realized that it was a story written for people with very undeveloped funny bones. It was a chore reading this book even though I was on a six hour train ride"
5,THE ANTI-HERO PAR EXCELLENCE,"Initially, one is tempted to regard the protagonist Ignatius as a vile, offensive slob, but as you continue, you come to admire him for his gall, his meanness, his bloated self-confidence and his overwhelming self-righteousness. The plaisir du texte is of course, enhanced by the wonderful interweaving web of plot and subplots, and by the colourful array of characters. This is one of those rare novels that becomes so addictive that you compulsively read on between the fits of hysterical laughter. Not one word is unnecessary, not once sentence is superfluous. It is in fact, absolutely brilliant and for someone like myself who has no intention of reading Rabelais or Cervantes, it is sufficient. I recommend it also as a very effective cure for depression."
5,Entertaining,"Well whats the making of a great novel? Well I laughed out loud many times I got mad many times,and even felt sympathy. In my mind thats the making of a great novel. The preachings and philosophies of Ignatius are out of this world,and the reactions he creates from bosses,people on the streets,friends,and anybody he comes in contact with are madcap hilarious.Its a shame Toole let life get the best of him,He would have been stupendously funny."
5,Entertainingly meaningful,"Occasionally I will read a book that causes me to chuckle out loud once or twice. This book made me laugh out loud so often my roommates started worrying about me. The comic relief aside, a masterpiece."
5,terrific,"If you suffer from a valve inopportunely slamming shut, this is the book for you. There is a two page section which made me laugh so uncontrollably I passed out. I reread it five more times, and although I didn't pass out, I laughed very heartily. Fortuna's wheel brought this to us, so buy it and read it. It is terrific."
4,a wonderful surprise,"""Confederacy"" is among the most original and entertaining novels I have ever read. There is much that makes ""Confederacy"" unique: a wonderfully tight, complex yet `ripping` plot; phenomenal characters brilliantly portrayed; an unforgettable protagonist; and, crucially, a tremendous sense of humor. It was a complete surprise to me: I picked it up without knowing anything either about the novel or its (tragic)author. I was left with a memorable read and a sense of loss of a great talent.One additional comment. I highly recommend also avoiding this Evergreen paperback edition. The material of the cover is very pretty and has a nice feel, but its also impossible to read the book without the cover getting completely bent over. Serious readers will find the US$ 8 dollars extra for the hardback edition available on Amazon a very worthwhile investment, particularly for such a timeless novel"
3,Enlghting but not Practical,"If you always feel miserable with certain people, but don't know why, this is a very good book to read. However, if you want to know how to deal with ""nasty people"". There are better books to read. (One of my favorite books is ""Asserting Yourself"".)"
2,Didn't Help,"I was disappointed with this book. I wanted to give it a one, but I don't want to be the worst ""Invalidator."" I expected to find more information on how to deal with nasty people, but like what someone said, it's chock full of explanations about invalidators. I had to force myself to finish the book. It does have some good insights. But it just fell short of my expectation."
5,This book saved my life.,"Four years ago I nearly took my life. After desperately reading books looking for answers, my brother found ""Nasty People"". He called me and told me to hang on until I could get the book! Within hours the book had made sense of what had happened to my world, which had been so cruelly turned upside down. Each sentence brought me peace of mind, that I indeed was not crazy. I had no idea there were ""Nasty People"". I could not explain to anyone what this person was doing to me. I looked like the crazy one. Jay Carters book was short enough, it could be read by those close to me and they could understand and see what was happening! I am still dealing with that person, but I am indeed dealing with him and have helped him to be a ""Good Person"". Jay Carters book is invaluable."
1,You lost me with your last chapter,"I was willing to accept your premise until the last chapter, which was filled with rage. No wonder my kids are confused in this modern society. They believe that your book will dissolve all bitter issues between a parent and a child. In my opinion, this is not a healthy book for settling conflict. It only adds fuel to the fire of less than healthy relationships. Lines like , ""I will enjoy seeing you disappear. Your elimination will give me sustenance,"" are destructive to the cohesiveness of a family system which will continuously endure the strife of individualism. And isn't that what a free and democratic society is supposed to be about?"
5,The perfect gift for selected poeple.,"This is the perfect gift to help others cope with the Nasty People in their lives. Mr. Carter's text is simple, clear and direct. The information is entertaining and valuable. Mr. Carter supplies the reader with new insights and effective tools for dealing with a 'Nasty'.I have purchased many copies over the years and simply save them until I encounter a distressed victim of a 'Nasty.' Recently I gave a copy to a college professor who loved it.Many thanks to Mr. Carter for his efforts and to Amazon for making this book availiable."
3,Caution,"This is an enlightening and validating book. Truly, it helps people to see and accept how others might be putting them down. On the other hand, it is a recipe for total paranoia if not used with intelligence. Everyone can be seen as an invalidator if we so choose. Sometimes people criticise us or we feel bad around them for other reasons, like they know better than we do or we feel they are superior to us. Don't uncritically assume that a critic or ""better"" person must be playing invalidation games with you.The way to respond to invalidation is to ignore it. That way, you can't go wrong. If that person really is invalidating you or if you just imagined it, you ignore it."
3,Semi-scorching stories,3 1/2Sax-solo-centric songwriting sags Sonny's selections from potential transcendental to appreciative predictability.
3,The Final LBT sequil.........,"Some of you are probably relieved that they are now going to stop making sequils. (I'm a little bit tired of it myself.)From what I have heard, this is what the plot is:The day comes when all of the young flyers of the great valley fly with the adults. Petrie has a harder time with the formations, being the late bloomer that he is. He also works better alone. Cera starts to have problems with a new member possibly coming in the family. Also, a young flyer with feathers wants to know who he is. Once he figures this out, the kids set out to a perilous joruney through the mysterious beyond.Also, to you Rinkus and Sierra fans, they will be coming back! ^_^My Opinoin: It sounds good by far, but from what I heard, Pterano WILL NOT be coming back unfortunately. That's sort of messed up you know? Maybe they're just saying that to surprise us. That would be nice. :)"
3,don't look new,got packaged ok plastic torn at corner small scratches on dvd not new listed as new missing papers inside dvd. would not buy from them again.Are not being honest.
4,A worthy addition to The Land Before Time serious,"The newest installment has the lovable dinos meeting a new and unique creature named Guido. Guido has no memories of who or what he is other than his name. It is up to Littlefoot and the gang to help Guido find his place in the world. Petrie has the most to gain from associating with Guido because like Guido he is having a hard time fitting in with the other flyers. Petrie is having trouble getting ready for the day of the flyers (his rite of passage to become an adult) because he must learn to fly in formation with his siblings. However, he is only good at flying when alone. The whole premis of the movie is that Guido and Petrie learn that it is OK to be different and to accept who you are."
5,Kids love them,"My kids, 6 & 3, love the whole Land Before Time series of movies. My daughter watches them all the time."
5,"If You Love Hal Roach Comedies, Buy This","This makes a great soundtrack to your kids' lives, if you have youngenz playing around the stereo as we do ... another companion disc is now out of print, but find that one too, as that has other pieces this does not. The liner notes are fascinating ... anyone who grew up watching The Rascals will LOVE this lovingly reproduced collection of Roach backgrounds ... though I've read some fishhook jabs in other reviews about The Beau Hunks not getting EVERY SINGLE NOTE exactly right, those people should remember, if they read the accompanying literature, that the group had no sheet music to play from for that first cd - all done by ear. Because the original material is unavailable except from the films themselves, this is the only way to enjoy this music, sans the voice tracks, without your TV on. As good as it gets, and it was recorded live with two overhead mikes, as in the old days. I give this unique recording a 5 out of 5 mikes."
1,Written for third-graders!,"This has got to be the most boring, condescending biography I've ever read. Garth Brooks is a complicated man, but instead of doing the research to get inside his head, the author just trifles through the facts of his life. There is no emotion...nothing that draws the reader in and asks them to feel anything. And the writing style suggests that Garth Brooks fans are uneducated and illiterate. I'd give this book 0 stars if it was an option. Don't waste your money."
5,Intake tube 300-925-1,"This intake matched up to my 08 3.7L V6, provided I had to use somethings from my stock intake to make it fit. Also had to get a Powerwire from airaid.com b/c the IAT sensor was futher away."
4,"Beautiful, somber all female comp",Mimi Parker (Low)makes her debut solo effort as does Rebecca Gates (Spinanes) on this compelling follow up to Shanti Project Collection. All the tracks are new or rare and quite satisfying. I'm especially fond of Mimi Parker and Julie Doiron's (Eric's Trip) tunes. The photographs and booklet design is beautiful and overall the cd is well worth adding to your collection.
3,It's alright...,"It's a pretty cool game. The graphics are EXCELLENT for a PS2 game. The controls are a little confusing at times and the AI are very aggressive. The sounds are nice. Overall it's a pretty cool game. Don't expect a ""War For Cybertron"" type of game though."
3,wow,"now i dont like trans formers and in a kid but i think this game would be fun i mean i hope they put more effort into the game then they did with the show. ya sure little kids watch the show and they like it and us big kids hate it and the big kids even most grownups might even like it. its a shooting game without any blood. and my parents hate games with blood so what im saying is its a game that you can shoot and kill robots a drive,fly,ect. and most likley most parents will aprove of it so im kind of lookin forward to it."
4,Worth the time and money,"What fun! I've never been a fan of third person shooters, but combining this game with the Transformers' genre was an idea that piqued my interest and delivered. Gameplay is smooth, graphics are very good (but not great), CGI's are incredible. Not the Transformers I grew up with (with the exception of Prime), but I can deal with it. Overall, I'd recommend it for Transformers fans of any age."
5,The Game,"If you expect this game to be from the 80's this isn't it. But this game is good and it is from the new series Aramda and Emergon. You can use mini-coms. You can use the Autobot's Prime, Hot Shot and Red Alert. This game is loved by many people."
2,Very lackluster,"I was very excited about this game and while it was neat to finally be able to run around and ""transform and roll out"" thegame play itself is a major disappointment. It's a essentially a shooter game with some amazing graphics. The controls are awful and the gameplay repetetive. I'm a life long Transformers fan and this game really disappointed."
4,This Transformers Game is Cool !,"This game is cool I like the graphics, action, and the ability to blow bots up. If anyone likes action or adventure games this is the game for you. I thought I woulden't like it because it features Transformers Armada, which is stupid. game is also challenging with graphics that blow your mind. This game in some battles is pretty hard. Well thats why I give it 5 stars."
4,Ignorant reviews,"For all those folks who reviewed this game and were ticked that there were no G1 Transformers in it, you obviously haven't been paying any attention to the Transformers universe the last oh...20 years! This game is based on the Transformers Armada cartoon series, NOT the G1. Originally they were going to call it Transformers: Armada but then the cartoon changed to Energon and so they scrapped the Armada part. The Mini-cons are a part of the Armada and Energon worlds NOT the G1 world. The game play does take time to get used to but with some time devoted becomes much easier. This is not an easy game. I'd recommend this for gamers 10 and up due to the challenge. A great game for those not expecting G1 Transformers."
5,Brilliant,I picked this book up on a whim. The cover was pretty and I liked the title. But that aside. This book was amazing absolutly brilliant. The plot twists kept me reading and the charachterization of Jude and all the cast was amazing. I'm 18 and I disagree with the judgement. I think that you have to be at least 15 to understand this. Anyone younger won't understand the drug and social things.When I finished this I loaned it to my mother who was completly swept up in this novel. While some may critisize the charachterization of Jude's mother I feel she (like everyone else) is amazingly written and credible.
4,Captivating,"Finally, a nice, good teenage novel that doesn't require use of love stories, text language and cheerleaders to score with readers.I was a little skeptical of it at first as Drugs aren't really my type of a good read, but Kate drew me in from the first page and from then on, the ride was smooth and captivating. There are rarely books that can lure me into their world. I admitt I can get picky at times, and if a book fails to bring me in in time, I will immediately abandon it. However, Jude managed to do it for me.A good plot, simple but effective expression and overall a recommendation"
5,"Great band, great music!","Song listing:1)If I could be with you one hour tonight2)tin tin deo3)mariooch4)all too soon5)28th & 8th6)what am I here forBacking musicians:Bob Brookmeyer-trombone, Jo Jones-drums, Emmet Berry-trumpet, Milt Hinton-bass, Nat Pierce-piano.A fantastic session from 1961. The music is relaxed, bluesy swing and Hawkins and Russell are both in fine form. According to the liner notes from the original LP, most of the songs were done in one take. And it shows in the music. These men were all in tune with each other and collectively had a few years experience under their belts! Probably not one of Hawkins better known albums but one any Hawkins fan will want in their collection."
4,"More lazy afternoon reading,","Books like this one is the reason I look forward to my lazy Saturday afternoons. Light, entertaining, and fun, fun, fun! You won't be disappointed!"
2,disappointed,"The good new is the Lori Foster continues to grow as a writer ... the bad news is that her old stuff is really not very good. The first fifty pages were alright. I wish that the book had just ended there. However, it continued on and the other 3/4s just didn't cut it.Really, you have a couple in love and the only problem is that her sister is unhappy. And she shows her unhappiness by having a couple of conversations with her sister. What was the point?Wait for her new book coming out on Feb 1. The old work just isn't worthwhile."
3,Need a quick book to read?,"This is a good book when you are looking for a quick read without a lot of depth. The book has 2 short stories that are entertaining. Lori Foster's story I believe is from 1999. She has definately improved with time. Even so, sometimes I am not looking for deep literature and this fit the bill."
2,Frame was scratched - returned immediately,"The frame is beautiful, simple and reasonably priced for Waterford, but it arrived scratched all over the front and I returned it immediately."
3,RVN 1964,"The pace of the story is slower than I had expected, but it picks up about half way thru, when Muc Wa becomes important. The subsequent movie, Go Tell The Spartans, differs in many ways from the book. I gave it 3 stars. It's worth reading, but the movie was a little better."
4,", We Could Have Won!","First, I am a veteran. Also, I instructed and advised foreign troops. So, I read this excellent book differently than the other Amazon reviewers . Ford's book is also a metaphor for how we COULD have won the war in SE Asia. Our special ops people (SF & SEALS)had the right idea and the proper operations in place to win. Our guys won every battle, including Tet. The war was lost by careerists vs warriors, i.e.,too many career ambitious remf staff officerswho defeated the special operations mindset whenever they could.Also, the war was lost by nitpick meddling from elected things in DC and by a defeatist media. If you don't believe me, read what the miltary leaders of the NVA wrote in their histories of that war.Ford's book is a metaphor for this interpretation every bit as much as it is for the civilian interpretation. Like all reviewers here I share the same awe for Ford's incredibly accurate , on-target,conclusions of the book/war, considering it was written in themid '60s."
5,Good for a Volume Pedal,"Well, it does what is intended, well. It's got a stridy Dunlop design like a wah pedal. If you're wanting a good volume pedal, this is a good choice."
4,Excelent Pedal,"I got What I paid for, a volume pedal, excelent response. FOUR star because one thing, Went i turn off the volume from the pedal, I gotta make shure that it's on exact 0 ""cero"" volume, because if it's not, It's gonna sound a lil' lil' lil' bit... But I Love the pedal anyway"
2,not quite good enough,"The ocean noise on this CD is good and calms my 11 week old, but a few minutes into it there are seagulls calling. They are loud and startle the baby and then he needs to be calmed again, only to be disrupted by more seagulls later. Because of the seagulls, this is not a good CD."
3,hopefully,we will see after it rains...... as far as the product clean for now.... packing was superb and all was well
3,apc turning light,"Cheap decent looking lights , dont match stock headlights more of a chrystal look. Only problem is they have water in them already. My blazer didnt even leave the driveway with them in yet and there was water in them after a raining that night. You get what you pay for ,"
3,An odd compilation,"I love Keith Jarrett's Impulse recordings with the American ""Quartet"", but the selection on this compilation is mystifying. Much of his most important, exciting work on the label (""Death and the Flower"", ""Shades of Jazz"", ""Inflight"") is omitted, instead emphasizing the group's lesser work from their final two albums. Still, there's some great stuff on here -- ""The Rich (and the Poor)"" is one of their best soul-jazz-influenced tunes, and ""Everything That Lives Laments"" conjures up mysteries.If you're interested in checking out Jarrett's Impulse work -- and I highly recommend that you do -- you should get either the 5 CD 1973-74 box set or (for a more bite-sized taste) the album Fort Yawuh."
2,To expensive!,"This ""Film"" is only 19 min long and the price is $9.99 when Nonook of the North with a like an hour and only $1.99. What the Heck!"
1,Straddling Low Quality and Price Gouging.,"I had to purchase this for a class. This is among the worst documentary shorts I have seen. Yanomami: Straddling Two Worlds is monotonously narrated, poorly paced, abominable quality, and worst of all: overpriced. Whoever sells this video is obviously in cahoots with my professor in an educational supplement scam: $9.99 times 30 students times four semesters per year comes out to $1,198.80, and that's just for one professor. Amazon Instant Video is the only place on the internet where this video is available, and believe me, nobody is thankful for this monopoly. I have bought DVDs for cheaper than this. In fact, I wish I watched one of those DVDs instead of this."
5,He Was There!!!!!,"Bishop Paul Morton was given the vision for this full gospel confrence, yet as they recorded this C.D. the spirit of the Lord was pleased and he fell in that place like never before.People were healed, delivered and set totally free in the spirit, as they entered into worship the spirit of the lord was there and he showed out.Experience the Fullness of his presence with this video, Why? because He Was There."
5,Keeps me grooving,"I have listened to this CD at least 50 times in the last week. I don't tire of it, and it keeps me grooving all day long. Do you like Lazy Dog, Kerri Chandler, EBTG? If so, you will really dig this. Hot stuff. This is one CD in a series of 5, ""The 5 Buroughs of Dance"", they are all different forms of dance. They are all worth a listen, but if you into House, im telling you ""Brooklyn"" hits the spot, with a close second ""Manhattan""."
4,typical quality for a sog folder - which isn't good,"Rounded up for 3.5 stars. I bought this after getting a Spec Elite 1. It had lateral and vertical play, but I thought that was a fluke. Had wanted a tomcat for years and finally pulled the trigger. I will be sending it back. It feels solid, the blade is beautiful and super sharp, it feels good in the hand, but the blade play still exists. Going to knife forums, I realized this is the case with manysog folders, their anomaly is a folder with no play. This should not be the case with this expensive of a knife and this excellent of materials. This things has the play of a $0.50 folder I can get at walmart. This price point should produce a pretty flawlessly operating knife. SOG designs are nice, but their craftsmanship is wanting and this will be the last one I buy."
3,"Fun,but there are HUGE! cursing issues","Yep despite the E rating the game uses lots of cursing.as for the game play its pretty good with nice graphics sound effects.This game takes place during the Sarges heros timeline,Which of coures means there is Cursing.The story line is nice and the soundtrack is ok,But for the title theme 3DO used another remix of the Toys in space theme.Over all I do not recamend this army men game to anyone unless they are 20 or over.If the game did not have cursing I whould give it a 4 and a half,But sadly because of the cursing I give it a 3.Instead get Army men II or Army men World war,Or perhaps Army men 3D."
4,cool game,Check this one out -- it's fun and doesn't require hours of manual reading before you can get in and start blasting little plastic guys.
2,Not what I expected,"I really wanted the famous sea poets and authors: Masefield, Tennyson, etc. What I got was some of that, but interspersed throughout with the anthology editor's own poetry -- which I'm sorry to say, isn't that great. And the editor doesn't appear to know much about sailing either; for instance, he totally misses the nautical meaning of the line ""when the long trick's over"" (Sea Fever). A trick is a turn at the wheel, standing watch, silly rabbit!Serious sailor-readers should find a different book."
2,Ink guzzling printer requires this cartridge,"I bought a cheap Xerox printer, the Docuprint C8, that uses this small black ink cartridge. I am constantly running out of ink. Avoid the printer that uses this cartridge unless you enjoy shopping for office supplies."
2,Xerox Ink Cartridge 8R7994,"I realize that printers are cheap and that the manufacturers make their profit on the sell of the ink cartridges, but this is terrible. These cartridges are too high priced and very inconvenient. I can't find them on the shelves at the stores, so they have to be ordered. I'm always out of Black Ink."
5,Bike helmet,"This was exactly what I wanted and was not able to find here in Kansas City. I have had one of these for several years and this is the best type of helmet I have been able to find. Shipping did not take very long, just a few days during the Christmas rush.Thanks!"
4,skate boarding helmet,The helmet is as described and is true to size. My 13 year old son likes it and wears it. I'm happy.
3,Cute but small.,"Maybe I just have a giant head but the padding included with this helmet makes it way way too tight to wear for me. It comes with front (forehead) padding, top 'o the head padding, and a back of the neck/side padding. Three separate pieces. I had to remove the top and re-position the side padding to make it work. Hopefully I don't crash my bike while wearing this."
4,Color doesn't quite match the photo,"The helmet I ordered is a different shade of gray than that of the picture. It has silver lettering while the photo shows it to have black lettering. The one I ordered looked a little better, but this one is alright. Fit is a little snug even though I was at the lower end of the sizing scale. Oh well, it's just a helmet."
4,Awesome Design but Too Small,"I needed to replace my old Giro MTB helmet. Since I live in Malaysia and I couldn't find a decent helmet from any local retailers, I ordered two L-size helmets from Amazon, one by Giro and the other by Protec. The Giro helmet came with adjustment helmet, so it fits perfectly; however, the Protec helmet only came with one set of padding inside, and it was a bit small for my head. I love the design (black base with red Devil), and no point returning it; so I will just give it to my nephew. For this particular Protec helmet, I recommend that get one size bigger than what you normally wear and adjust fitting with extra padding, if necessary."
4,Tight fit otherwise looks to be a good helmet,"The paint is nice and the color is vibrant. Looks like a high quality product, but consider ordering at least one size larger if you're going by the measurements provided by Amazon / Pro-tec"
1,Not an adult helmet,Received the helmet. Marked XL...could not get it on my head. While not marked as adult or child anywhere on the packaging it is a child's size. The little pamphlet inside the box had a line drawing of a young boy wearing the helmet. It is going to my kid...age nine...fits him fine.
4,"Nice helmet, small sizing","I bought this helmet for my wife. The helmet looks awesome, it looks very quality and from handling it, it seems to be excellent quality, however the size is definitely meant for children. Based on the sizing chart from the manufacturers website (for adult helmets), my wife needed a small. So, we ordered a small. When it arrived she tried it on and it was way too small. My 11 year old daughter tried it on and it was even to small for her. It fit my 8 year old son the best, but it was pink so we opted to send it back instead of making him wear a pink helmet. We're going to order another, however this time we'll be ordering a large."
4,Pretty nice Helmet,"The helmet is really nice. I would only caution that they run a little small. Bought this for my 11 year old son and i should have gone with the next size up. My kids head is rather large but I assumed a large would be big enough. It fit but was a little snug, otherwise would be a perfect rating."
5,A SURE BET,"You know exactly what you get yourself into when picking up a Jackie Collins novel: a sugarcoated tale of glamour and lust with a roman à clef attitude. This time around, LOVERS AND GAMBLERS takes you into the glamourous life of Dallas and Al, two gorgeous misfits who suffer greatly in the name of love. Their destined-to-be-together union is a roller coaster ride of secrets and lies only Jackie Collins can concoct, and that means a lot of sins, a lot of sex, and whole lot of page turning. She may not be Proust, or even Nora Roberts for that matter, but, boy, can she handle her pen. It is as wicked as any of her villains. Her over-the-top imagination works to the very end. Don't hesitate to pick up LOVERS AND GAMBLERS. It is a one-sitting romp that deserves all the stops.-----Martin Boucher"
3,"Sex, drugs and rock and roll","This is a reissue of the 1977 edition.Al King is a rock singer and selfish stud extraordinaire. His brother and manager, Paul King, gets Al whatever he wants and boy does he want a lot.Dallas is a former hooker gone beauty queen/actress. Everyone wants a piece of her and she plays hardball like the best of them.Al and Dallas are destined to get together, but you have to wade through many pages to get there.The other characters are thrown in for good measure.As usual Jackie Collins gives us sex, drugs and rock and roll in the Hollywood/rock scene. It's been years since I read a Collins book and forgot how baudy and brash they were. Be that as it may, I couldn't put it down.If you want a wild read, this one's for you!!"
1,"oh, it's just awful!","I've been doing a search for Passover music, and took a chance on this one. It's an example of why too many people think that Jewish music is dull and old-fashioned. Judy's voice is thin and tremulous, the musical accompaniment is practically non-existent. One gets the feeling that Judy's loving family paid to help her make this recording on a shoestring. The renditions are so solemn, slow, and lifeless that this might be funeral music, not music for a joyful celebration of food, family, and freedom.Don't waste your money and for goodness sake, don't make your seder guests listen to this."
5,I LOVE THIS CD!,"I love this CD! Judy Rubenstein has created a wonderful recording and an invaluable teaching tool. Everyone can now learn the traditional melodies of the Passover holiday. I recommend it to anyone who wants to conduct or participate in a festive, joyous, and lively Seder."
3,Basic Information,"I found this book to be pleasant to read. The format was simple and the typeset easy to follow. I would have given a higher review but found a lot of redundancy throughout it. I have had a long time interest in the paranormal and would never try to compare my knowledge to that of the the author, however found that the technical information a bit scarce and many of the tips to be no more than common sense. I wish Mr. Roesch had gotten into a bit more detail. With that, I have to admit the intention is probably for educating the begginer whom might not have a strong scientific background. All said, a good buy and definitely an enjoyable read."
5,Great ideas to catch the perfect ghost!!!!,I enjoyed the personal story this author has written. Great book! He's been on the news and in several news articles too. He also has a great website titled: Haunted Fort Lauderdale.This book is a must read for any ghost hunter enthusiast. Brian Roesch is Fort Lauderdale's finest ghost hunter!!!
1,Absolutely Horrible!,"This is, hands down, the worst book on ghost hunting I've read of late. ... The author appears to be 13 years of age at best given his outlook on the topic and his general attitude. The advice given in some areas is bad at best and might get you arrested in a worst case scenario.I don't trash many authors as I know how difficult it can be to write something but there are only 2 valid reasons I can think of to buy this book. 1) To see how NOT to write a book about this topic 2) for firewood kindling."
5,WOW! excellent book,I couldn't put this book down. His stories reminded me of my days in the Pacific and Persian Gulf only a few years ago. You will understand the patriotism that our veterans felt and their perspective toward the enemy. I have an understanding of what our veterans went through and also the war they fought. I think everyone would benefit from reading this book and I recommend it highly!
4,Fun,"I'm not a fan of Ms Heyer's regency romances, but I have enjoyed her mysteries. In this book, the tyrannical patriarch of a family is discovered dead in his bed. While his sister, sister-in-law, niece and nephew who live with him believe he must have died of a heart attack in his sleep and his doctor declares he died of natural causes, his other sister who comes over, takes one look at him and demands a postmortem, much to the alarm and horror of the rest of the family.The heir is loathed by all in the family for being irreverent and rude. But is he all that he seems? The results of the postmortem indicate that death was the result of poison. But how was it administered and who could have done it. Our Inspector Hannasyde is baffled at the lack of clues. There is no shortage of suspects ... it seems everyone had a reason to want dear old Uncle dead. In building the case, Ms Heyer keeps us guessing right until the last couple of pages."
2,not one of Heyer's better efforts,"I believe Georgette Heyer was hoping to make the cousin Randall an attractive bad boy a la Johnny Depp; instead, he comes off as simply repugnant, like Philip Seymour Hoffman in the indie film ""Happiness."" Some of the other characters are simply caricatures. As others have mentioned, Heyer is tight-fisted with the clues, although the set-up is a clever one.Detective Inspector Hannasyde is an amiable and clever fellow, but readers would do better to instead read ""The Unfinished Clue,"" which is a better mystery with more likable characters."
5,Helpful Instruction,"This book provides plenty of helpful technical information for skaters. So much great information presented in a readable, non-boring format. Ms. Kerrigan manages to cover both on-ice and off-ice training as well as non-training topics, such as presentation and music. An enjoyable book that leaves me with a genuine fondness for Ms. Kerrigan personally and an appreciation for her athleticism."
5,Take me to your world/i don't wanna play house Tammy Wynette,"THIS ALBUM HAS TO BE THE MOST TREASURED I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO FIND YET. HER OLD ALBUMS ARE SPECTACULAR WITH WONDERFUL SONGS. I LOVE THE SONG BROADMINDED AND IT'S BEAT, SOMETHING ELSE! THAT SONG WAS THE REASON FOR ME BUYING IT. I REMEMBER SINGING ALONG TO IT WHEN I WAS 13 YRS. OLD. IT IS A BOUNCY TUNE THAT GRABS YOUR LIKING FOR...WELL, THE REST OF YOUR LIFE!"
3,"yet another chance to play ""smack tha' rogue..""","Eventhough the Rogue Warrior series has become fairly predictable, i have to say i always enjoy reading the latest installment, and this one was no exception. Yeah, he is always suffering ""painfull dings"", losing his gun, and having to kill the bad guys single handed, but hey. real life has plenty of ""Murphy Moments"" too. even if your the toughest navy seal in the U.S. I do think he comes up with some very interesting scenarios for his books, it's just that they all follow the same storyline."
3,Detachment Blotto,"Probably the weakest of the entire Rogue Warrior series, but the Rogue at half-strength is still much better than 90% of the writers out there and still worth reading. Some polemical asides on the nature of war, warriordom, spec ops, anti-terrorist tactics, etc. His explanations on some of the technical aspects of operations are interesting.When will he run out of Bad Guys? Who's next?Not a bad read but I am eager to see the next novel."
5,The greatest music of all time.,"This is the greatest writted & composed by one of the greatest composers, Leroy Shield and with him, Mavin Hatley."
4,brilliant but flawed,"Johnson is a man whose self-doubts have been erased by his Buddhist faith. His books, while erudite, passionate, sincere, thoughtful, and intellectually engaging, seem to engage the struggle for salvation only obliquely, with the head and not the heart. It is only because his themes are so weighty that this obliqueness becomes a flaw. Like most philosophical novels, Dreamer uses some cardboard characters to enact a morality play. The play -- and its characters -- are interesting enough to sustain prolonged contemplation. They do not, however, live on after the book is closed. Dreamer is original, compelling, and almost great. But its confidence makes it proud, and it stumbles over its eagerness for a message that is in the end all too true."
5,Unique and compelling insight,"While so many are willing to cast aside the struggles of the civil rights era as yesterdays news, Johnson tackles them head on. At its heart Dreamer is a valid book about M.L.King, whose worth comes from its peeling of King like an onion to expose the many layers and come close to the truth that doesn't appear every Feburary. Smith and Bishop are extremely developed characters who only deepen the books probing of King. A worthy read for a fan of fine lit. or American History."
3,Dreamer,"The bookDreamer: A Novelwas sold to me as ""new"" however, several of the pages have been highlighted previously with a yellow highlighter."
1,A waist of Time and Money,"Dreamer, while a good concept it lacks something. The story does not grab the reader's attention and for this reason took a long time to read. The idea of the book was good and enough for me to buy it but it did not give a good enough look at Martin Luther King. Dreamer put me off Charles Johnson's books for life and I would not recommend it to anyone. Simple stated a waist of money."
4,excellent :),"It arrived earlier than expected, was just what/how/when I wanted it. Two Thumbs UP! :)"
3,Not as good as the original too much percussion & distraction,"I was really looking forward to the score for Dead Man's Chest, particularly when I found out that Hans Zimmer would be writing it. I really like much of his work, however, I was ultimately disappointed with this cd. There was too much percussion, too much elecronics & too little music from the movie in it. I also saw little point in the final track on the cd, I would much rather have had the end credit music. I liked Jack's new theme, it fit him & while the themes for JOnes & the Dutchmen fit them well, I still found this cd lacking. I admit however I really enjoyed the Tortuga music."
5,pirates of the caribbean: dead man's chest,I have never purchased a movie sound track before. I was compelled to purchase this one. I and my husband loved the movie and the music. I was not surprised to read in the Denver Post that this sound track was number 3 on the Billboard Chart. I have listened to it many times and it still is entralling. Great job Hans Zimmerman!
2,PoTc soundtrack review,"The only problem I have with this, is that the number one song is named jack sparrow, instead of -Captain- Jack Sparrow."
4,Great Score!,"If you expect this score to be a revisit to Curse of the Black Pearl, you will be disappointed. Because not even the theme to the original movie is in this score. But if you listen to it as a stand-alone score without any expectations, it'll thoroughly entertain you. ""The Kraken"" is the best track by far. A very unearthly track that depicts a good deal of action with very strong ""Phantom of the Opera"" overtones associated with Davy Jones. The Track ""Davy Jones"" is also very good with the music box and organ arrangement.The ending Techno track is a complete waste that should have never been included. It isn't even good techno. I don't care how famous Tiesto is, his music just doesn't belong here. The ""Bonus Track"" should have been more music from the movie."
4,"Love the sound track, hate the remixes","I love the Pirates movies and love all of the sound tracks. This one is my least favorite because of the number of remixes. It seemed like they were just trying to fill the CD and didn't have enough so they included a bunch of remixes that I'm not very fond of. Luckily, I don't have to listen to them. Because there were so many remixes on the CD, I only gave this a 4 and not a 5."
5,Great soundtrack for a great movie,"I prefer this soundtrack over the first movie, simply because the songs are stronger and more suspenseful, and this includes full versions of songs that weren't fully included in the movie. It even included the fun Tortuga bar fight song. This is a very memorable movie, and the soundtrack just completes it. Wheel of Fortune and The Kraken are among the strongest songs on the album."
4,"Good,but could have been excellent","When I first heard the soundtrack, I was alittle disappointed. It didn't have the punch of the first movie. But I kept listening to it and realized that it was actually good, it was just different than the first soundtrack. I just wish that the end credit music had been included instead of the techno-remix.It just didn't fit in with the rest of the soundtrack."
3,Decent,"I don't know how much I'm going to listen to this one. The Gladiator rip-off was unnecessary, and I believe there was an Armageddon steal as well. The techno remix was pointless--and I'm a fan of both Zimmer and Tiesto!"
3,Not so good as the movie,"I expected to be more 'epical' and at least to have again the music of the titles. I didn't like the Tiesto's remix...actually I don't like Tiesto......I don't like DJs in general. They don't make music, they re-arrange the music, they mix the music......anyway, the best part in my opinion, was 'The cracken' and the 'wheel of fortune'."
2,No! Not good! Stop! Not good!,"Nowhere near as good as the first soundtrack and the final track is down right criminal. What was the composer thinking? The only good thing about it is the snips that resemble the first soundtrack. Spare yourself the expense and stick with the first soundtrack. If you didn't pick up the first one, you're missing something special and if you did, it's the only ""Pirate Music"" you'll need for now. Let's see what happens with the third one."
4,Wonderful sountrack!,"This was a great soundtrack filled with a variety of inspiring music; fast and dramatic, slow and pretty, lighthearted and nimble (Jack Sparrow's theme). I was, however, disappointed with a few things: for one, some of the main pieces were not included in the CD, and there was not a proper overture. There was also not much music; only about an hour. But the music that was there was fabulous, and I would definitely recommend this soundtrack to everyone who has read this review, especially if you like this kind of music and/or the movie."
4,Enjoyable,"Before buying this CD I read many negative reviews, I purchased it anywayand am very glad I did. It is exactly what you would expect from a movie soundtrack and I have enjoyed it."
4,Awesome movie Music,This Haunting Soundtrack will make you cry when you hear Davy Jones Theme and cheer when you hear the main title music.Pirates Fans rejoice - buy this soundtrack now...
4,Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest Soundtrack,This product was delivered well and on time and has been a great buy as well. I would certainly recommend it to others.
3,Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest,"Of the 3 Pirates cd's this is my least favorite, the first being my favorite because of the rousing music, this is good, but not great. Not quite as good as the PotC At World's End. However, to get the full impact of Pirates, I recommend that you get all three cd's."
4,"Enchanting, captivating",This was a very enjoyable and captivating cd. Has a few diverse moods. My two young daughters love it.
2,It's a film soundtrack,"Everyone has an opinion, and music is so subjective to begin with-That said- neither Dead mans Chest or the third installment of the films music have near the lyric quality or melodic themes of the 1st.plus this to me, is devoid of emotion- its a film score just like many , many others- However, the exception is Davy Jones theme. I do rather like it- but again I would prefer it more simple. And all those who think they can recognize Zimmer? sorry, but Badelt would not have been credited with composing the melody on Curse had he not done just that.I don't think Zimmers variations on the original theme do anything for the music or the film. I liked the original- a more contemporary treatment is just not my cup of tea- but it will be for someone else."
1,Extremely disappointed in this.,"It was like Hans Zimmer was too lazy to think of anything new. The music was my favorite part of the first film and I was excited to hear new music on the second, only it was basically the same. Way to be original."
5,No fear,excellent.presentation..but not an easy read for people withabove but not stratospheric IQ such as myself.Worth the effort though.JoeKZ
5,Very engaging and entertaining,"I totally loved the book. It's full of insightful points and connections that will put you in a state of awe. I got totally ecstatic while reading some of the chapters, made me remember why I loved physics in the first place. Even if you are very well trained in physics, I am sure you will find this book very enlightening and it will allow you to see things from a new and very beautiful perspective.Only one thing.. Non physicists might become lost after the first few chapters. I think the book is more suited for physics students than for the layman."
5,great insights even for a Phd theoretical physics student!!,"I totally loved the book.Its full of insightful points and connections that will put you in a state of awe. I got totally exctatic while reading some of the chapters, made me remember why I loved physics in the first place. Even if you are very well trained in physics, I am sure you will find this book very enlightning and it will allow you to see things from a new and very beautiful perspective.Only one thing.. non physicists might become lost after the few fist chapters. I think the book is more suited for physics students than for laymen."
5,Wonderful,"I got this Bible for my 10year old daughter to use at school. She was just thrilled with it, she just loves the colors. The book is typed in a clear font and the highlighting is fantastic. I definately recommend this Bible to anyone."
5,get this Bible,"i grew up with a rainbow study Bible, and have never quit using it since. My Bible study is far more effective because i can quickly realize the main point that each verse is conveying"
4,Jennifer <3,Im so happy I found this as a double feature.I saw both of these in the movie theatre & still love them till this day & not only for J Love who is such a sight to see.
2,I Know what you did last summer. I still know what you did last summer,To be honest it was just an okay movie. However I really feel that the younger generation would enjoy it more. Early teens till about 18 Years of age. Honestly the only reason why I bought it was because Muse Watson Was Starring in it. Like I said good gift for a teenager.
4,I don't understand,I just bought this 2-Disc set and have watched both discs and all the special features listed on the box are on the DVDs. Has Sony corrected their error or are people revewing the wrong SKU?
1,Really Bad,These movies are just horrible. I don't understand how everyone knows about them and how I didn't know they were complete trash.
2,"Yeah false advertising, but I still like these movies","I hate it when studios release DVDs w/ features that aren't even on the discs. Albeit, I was interested in the bonus features ""supposedly"" on the first DVD, and disappointed, I never owned the original DVDs so this is okay. Yeah, I was pissed because I wanted the features but, oh well, can we sue the studios? I honestly don't know. But for the price I paid for these DVDs (13 dollars) I'll deal, just like J.Lo Hewitt does in that video on disc 2."
1,I Still Know What You Did To This DVD Set!,"Thanks a lot for ripping me off Columbia Pictures! WARNING! If it's special features that you want as stated, than don't buy this set, there is none? Someone lied! Amazon.com, you need to stop the sale on this DVD set!"
4,Good option,"This is that kind of good deal. The movies are good. Considering the price we paid for it... Once again, it was a good deal."
3,"First one Great, Second one eeehhhhhhh","The first installment was amazing! great cast and great story. As for Part 2, it was good but it became lil corny. I love Jennifer Love Hewitt to death, but the sequel didnt make me scared at all. The best is when shes in the rain lol the man know what im talkin about"
2,Mediocre at Best,"These guys have been doing the local Connecticut scene for over a decade. The band has gone through several lineup changes over the years, but they never seem to be able to break out onto the national market. I'll give their drummer some props, but that's about it. The cd left me wanting more, a lot more. A valiant effort, but I'd say it's mediocre at best."
5,Riveting!,"When a DEA raid on a drug baron's wilderness compound goes bad with casualties on both sides, there's going to be hell to pay. The federal agents had explicit orders to capture Reynaldo Juarez alive, so how did he escape custody only to end up with a bullet through his brain? Santa Barbara attorney Luke Garrison is brought in as Special Prosecutor by his old law school friend, Nora Ray, now the local D.A.As Luke begins building an airtight case against DEA agent Sterling Jerome for Juarez's murder, troubling questions arise about the local sheriff, sudden wealth on the nearby Indian reservation, the veracity of some of the evidence against Jerome, etc. And there's something about Nora... This is a great novel encompassing elements of mystery, suspense, police procedural, and courtroom drama, with a shocker of an ending."
2,"Slow, Slow, Slow!","This book seemed to take a century to get through. The only part that I liked was the drug bust in the beginning with all the action and the assassination. After that it seemed that the book just dragged on and on. I like Luke Garrison, the main character, alot. If you are going on a vacation and need a book to read, then this won't be a bad choice if you need a time fillerg. Don't et me wrong, J.F. Freedman is a good author. I absolutely loved ""The Disappearance."" That was a great book, but ""Above The Law"" was just too long and slow paced. I have faith in Freedman's next novel."
3,Saw the ending coming from a mile away.,"This is the first Freedman book I have read, and I did enjoy it. The basic story, as set forth in the other reviews, involves Luke Garrison, the former DA for Santa Barbara, being appointed special prosecutor to assist a law school friend with the investigation of a botched DEA raid.Freedman does a great job with characterization and a little too good a job with foreshadowing. There was not a single plot point ""revealed"" at the end of the novel that was not completely obvious several pages earlier.The other problem was that the book was about 10-15% too long. First there is the investigation, then there is the trial, complete with the same questions from the investigation. Unneccessary repetition made the book longer than it needed to be.That said, I still liked the book. The opening sequence, only tangentially related to the rest of the book, is exciting, tense, and completely ignored by the other reviewers."
3,A COMPLICATED COURTROOM THRILLER,"When a DEA drug raid goes bad, leaving several agents, as well as a top informant dead, Luke Garrison is called in to investigate what went wrong.Luke knows the case is a tough one, for exposing what went wrong will bring to light enemies in very high places.Determined to get answers, Luke will risk his life, to find out the truth.""Above The Law"" starts out with a bang, and then becomes too complicated to enjoy. With the introduction of too many characters, and a much too complicated plot, the book gets confusing, and boring.J.F. Freedman is a very good writer (check out any of his previous novels), but his usual fast-pacing, and suspenseful plot are missing in this book.Nick Gonnella"
5,Courtroom Murder Mystery Extrodinaire! Bravo!! Encore!!,"This is a very well written, well plotted book. I didn't guess the ending, which is rare for me. The author's first-person ""voice"" is great. You care about the people involved and you have to be interested in the twists and turns in the story. If Grisham keeps improving he may catch up with author J. F. Freedman, but I doubt it. I don't think there is a better writer than Freedman in the genre and ""Above The Law"" shows him at his best. Loved it and I am impatiently waiting for his next novel. Nice going, J.F!!!"
3,Good But Predictable!,"Above The Law is worth reading -- interesting plot, strong characters and fast-paced. However, unlike most of J.F. Freedman's legal thrillers, his latest effort provides few real surprises, as most of the attempted plot ""twists"" are apparent and predictable well in advance of when the author reveals them in the story. As other reviewers noted, one of the most exciting parts of the book is its opening sequence, although it has little relationship to the ""real"" story being told. Above The Law is a book that deserves to be read, but you might want to consider taking it from the library instead of buying it."
1,Frustrating!,"Though there were some problems, I did enjoy the first thirty pages of this novel: Nice dramatic plotting that grabbed me. Before long, the reader encounters developments which make little sense. Also,there are typos and really sloppy syntax which become increasing tiresome. I'm beginning to think we should all chip in for some of these best-seller authors to retake English 101. Simple sentence structure is obviously beyond many of them. The editors must have been on vacation when this one was published. About page 150, I just couldn't stand anymore of this tripe.Oh, it does not help that the protagonist is a jerk. A Muir County D.A. requests attorney Luke Garrison assume the role of special prosecutor. When he eventually decides to accept, he makes absurd demands, such on-demand use of air transport to and from his home (quite far away) and obscenely high fees for a financially depressed area. Were I in the D.A.'s office, I'd have suggested this egotistical SOB go take a flying leap!!"
1,trite PC rambling,"This author has discernible skill, but is unfortunately hobbled by his background. An obvious child of the 60's, his politically-correct philosophy precludes a realistic appraisal of human behavior and hence leads to a leaden portrayal of character traits and motivations. He should limit his activities to the Hollywood scene and forego any attempt at entering the world of honest literary achievement."
2,Ugh!,"As one person stated, this book has many flaws. One, it needed a better editor, just like Freedman's last book I read- Key Witness. Two, like someone else mentioned, the first story in this book, had nothing to do with the rest of the plot and it did not add to character development etc. It should not have been included. Three, it was slow going for me to get into the mystery and story. It was nearly 2/3rds into the book that I felt the story was finally moving along and I was finally getting a bit interested.Overall, I think I had a hard time getting into the story because I just didn't care for any of the characters, not even Luke. Especially not Nora or Jerome. At least, after sticking it out I did like the ending, although I predicted it early on and it was a bit far-fetched. I would not recommend JF Freedman, while I enjoyed The Disappearance, I have not liked any of his other books and I don't plan on giving him any more chances."
4,good courtroom drama,"If you like courtroom dramas, you'll love this book.The only irritating thing about reading this novel was all of the glaring typos. It's amazing that it was published in such a state! Nonetheless, I enjoyed the storyline and stayed up late into the night to finish it."
2,"Mediocre plot, OK characters, std liberal ideology","Overall pretty mediocre. You must believe a lot of nonsense to get through this book without throwing it down: 1) guy is killed and death ruled a suicide in the face of the simplest clue 2) Lady DA is dirty 3) She thinks the DEA will eventually solve a crime through sheer persistence (completely laughable) and so hires a friend who she knows is real smart to pursue the case, etc.Writing is about 2 steps above poor."
4,Interesting study / Studio Interesante,ESPANOL Este libro presenta un analisis interesante sobre la interpretacion de Rayuela por Julio Cortazar. Beneficioso para entender algunas ideas del escritor. Lo recomiendo altamente si le gusto Rayuela y si le interesa re-leerlo.ENGLISH This book presents an analysis very interesting on an interpretation of the book Rayuela by Julio Cortazar. It is very positive and helps big-time when trying to understand what the author wrote. I recommend it if you liked Rayuela and would maybe like to re-read it.
5,Yuletide Classic for the entire family! *A New Re-issue for 2012!!,"Mostly know by the alternate title ""Christmas In My Hometown"", this is probably my favorite 'made for TV' holiday movie with great performances from Tim Matheson and Melissa Gilbert plus a great opening song from country singer Travis Tritt. I too wonder why this DVD drifts in and out of production. This movie seems most appropriate with today's economy.A wonderful family movie not to be missed this Christmas!Update: 09.07.12 *Great News*Looks like this wonderful movie is being re-issued for 2012 at a normal price."
4,Great Hoilday movie!,Great Holiday family movie for the whole family love Melissa Gilbert and her and Tim Matheson together was a hit!Could not find in stores! Amazon came through!!
5,One of my favorite Christmas movies......,"After watching this movie many times on the television I decided to purchase it so I could watch it throughout the entire year. This is one ""feel good"" Christmas movies. If you haven't seen it.....you need to."
1,Not Worth Your Time,"Even though Melissa Gilbert is beautiful in this movie, the script didn't do her justice. I love Christmas movies and really wanted to like this movie, but didn't. The couple ""fell in love"" too fast. It wasn't believable. Where was the romance? The passion? It was totally underplayed. They could have made this movie so much better than it was."
4,Good Christmas movie.,Haven't seen this movie in years. It is no longer broadcast on TV. I was very glad I found it on Amazon. It is a very good light hearted Christmas movie and as good as any being broadcast today.
3,good but not great,"I had never seen this movie before but decided with all the great reviews that I would give it a try. It was a good movie and if I could, I would give it a 3.5 stars not just a 3. Anyway, clean and wholesome, which is always appreciated, but a bit choppy in some parts. It didn't grab our family like ""The Christmas Card"", and I guess I was looking for something along the same lines. But over all, glad to have it and will watch it again."
4,A Holiday for Love,I loved watching this movie for several years when it ran on TV. I just attempted to buy this movie on Amazon for my Christmas Movie Collection. Imagine my shock and then dismay when I saw the price for this movie. Can anyone explain why the cost is $69.99 to purchase this great holiday movie thru Amazon?
4,Christmas Movies,Came in new condition. It's a romantic Christmas movie and I love watching Christmas Movies. I collect them because during the Holiday I hate not getting the chance to watch all my favorites.
1,IN SPACE NO ONE CAN HEAR YOUR RIDICULE,"I am not going to say this is a bad movie.(it is).I am not going to say the production values are bad(they are). I am not going to say the acting was bad(it is).A spacecraft twice the size of Yankee Stadium with an impressive crew of 7-rescues the only survivors of a ship that was attacked by space pirates. the rescued are 4 beautiful women and are soon revealed to be the pirates and they take over the rescue craft. The balance of this atrocity involves an egg-shaped, green glowing orb which turns the cast into flesh eating space zombies. Since the entire cast is 11-the zombies will be hungry pretty soon.There is one scene worthy of MST3K. The only survivir boards an escape pod as the ship blows up. The escape pod looks and is the size of a coffin. All the escapee needs is a pair of pants, a low cut tee shirt and a portable oxygen tank and mask. There is a surprise and I could issue a spoiler but the movie is so ridiculous no one would care."
1,Bad,"Is Steve Railsback forced to remake ""Lifeforce"" again and again like it is some sort of celluloid Flying Dutchman?This is bad. The script is bad. The acting is bad. The gorey effects are bad.And no one in this mess takes the Mathilda May part from ""Lifeforce"" - if you know what I mean and I think you do.I've seen more tension in an overcooked noodle than that on show in this apology for a film."
1,Mother of all stinkbombs...,"About as low-budget as it gets. Two important life lessons, though: 1) Never, NEVER trust a B*tch. &2) If something is pulsing, glow in the dark green? Just leave it where you found it."
2,Trashy movie for a wet Sunday afternoon,Got this one for free so do not mind the movie being so trashy - definitely only for a wet Sunday afternoon when you're in the mood for a bad movie.
2,Give me a Break!,"There's hardly any plot to this SciFi movie. A spaceship with a small crew has some sort of energy transmitter on board that is needed on earth. Without any real explanation the crew is then attacked by zombie like creatures, that boarded the ship claiming to be in need of being rescued. At first those rescued people seem normal but then they suddenly turn into zombies. And that's it .... really that's all there is to it, except of course the inevitable shootouts and fights between the crew and the zombies. Really, a bad flick if you ask me. The plot just stinks, cause besides the shooting nothing ever else happens, for some 80 minutes or so. Avoid, this turkey, because its not even worth renting it."
5,"Red, red, red",Shoes are really pretty and comfortable. I have received many compliments. They are easy to clean and have a little elastic on the back that makes them easy to put on and take off. I have trouble wearing heels but I was able to handle these well.
3,A pleasant listen but...,"I've loved just about everything from the Innocence Mission, and when I read about this CD I had high hopes for it, but after repeat listening, the tempo and pace are just too uncomfortable compared to earlier albums. I know, this is supposed to be a lullaby album, but when you've come off from listening to some of there extremely enjoyable and upbeat songs from albums like 'Glow', it's really hard to get into the flow of this album. I had hopes that this would be more original recordings, but it really isn't. I hate to say anything bad about the Innocence Mission as I've loved so much of what they've done, but this one is not their best work. Someone new to their works would be better off starting with 'Small Planes'."
2,a bad cd is bound to happen...,"After a long and excellent musical career, who would have thought a terrible CD could happen to this band?As hard as it is for me to say, as this band has always been close to my heart, this cd is extremely disappointing in both musical quality and substance...completly uninspired drivel.save yourself and buy ANY of their other CD's first, they are all great.the cover choices on this CD are syrupy sweet, sentimental and exhausted...these guys have always been able to straddle the line with sentiment and exhuberance, but this one fell off the fence into a prickly patchi am so disappointed with this cd and with the band for making it...eagerly awaiting the next CD of their own material."
2,uninspiring,"the test for a successful cover is that given a choice between the original or the cover, you'd go with the cover. in nearly every instance here i was reminded how much better the original was. karen peris's lovely voice becomes monotomous as she slowly whines on one song after the other. her voice is normally on the ""sleepy-side"", so when she purposely slows it down it just turns dull. i like IM's version of ""Somewhere Over the Rainbow,"" other than that i would opt for the original. they just aren't adding anything to these classic tracks."
2,Puts everyone to sleep,"Combine Karen's lazy articulation (the older she gets the fewer consonants she's inclined to pronounce) with Don's arrangements of songs intended to put children to sleep, & what do you get? An album that puts everyone to sleep, if it doesn't annoy you enough to turn it off first. Me, I'll take Burl Ives singing ""The Moon Is the North Wind's Cookie,"" & an assortment of Mozart adagios for promoting a peaceful dreamland. Or Kristin Hersh's ""Murder, Misery and Then Goodnight,"" a collection of traditional folk songs she learned from her father. ""Now the Day Is Over"" thank heavens, maybe tomorrow won't be as boring."
2,Innocence Mission is an appropriate name,"Not the worst cd I have and certainly not offensive. However, lacks depth, character, and content. Could be good for the kids. Bought it because I fell in love with a track I heard on Radio Paradise. Overall I could have spent the money in other ways."
4,Thoughtful Interpretations,"Now That the Day Is Over is not the best or even an essential Innocence Mission album. However, having said that it does what it sets out to do and in a charming and disarming manner. It delivers a dozen or so gentle ballads that never ruffle and often sooth.The band has never ""rocked out"" much and on this disc the music is even slighter, which means that Karen Paris' voice carries much of the record. She has a nice, even voice that works fairly well, but I think stronger backing would have made for a better experience.The song selection is top notch, although songs like ""Somewhere Over the Rainbow"" and ""What a Wonderful World"" are clichés that the Innocence Mission do not bring anything new too.A nice Cd for younger children. If you picked up on the Innocence Mission with this record or are curious then you really should pick up their timeless debut and Glow. From there anything else is good as well, but start with those two."
3,The sweetest One Trick Pony ever,"It feels a little wrong to say anything remotely negative about this band , because they are so incredible genuine and pure, and their music is such a wonderful creation that reflects that. Anytime i feel worn down, their records are like loving arms laying me gently into rest.Their newest cd of lullabies is, of course, beautiful. It's also a one speed, one shade, one trick pony. So, while i love how fast it puts me to sleep, it's a little frustrating that it doesn't have half of the depth that ""Befriended"" does. What you see is what you get, and it's over before you can even toss and turn.My other critique is that two of the songs are recylced from older eps, and lps. I can understand including a b side, but to put a song on two different full length albums kind of feels like cheating.Bless this band. I'm hoping for another full length soon!"
2,Sickenly too sweet,"I am new to the Innocence Mission. We have a one year old baby, so a friend gave us this CD as a gift. For me, Karen Peris's voice has the ""nails across the blackboard"" effect on me. She has no range and her voice is cloying. I am not expecting rock 'n roll or anything like that, but I just cannot find anything attractive in her voice. She absolutely ""Somewhere Over the Rainbow,"" a classic and a song that I want to associate with my relatively unspoiled childhood. Oh well, different strokes for different folks."
5,Sensitive portrayal of a family under diificult conditions,The book is a very intellectual and sensitive portrayal of a family of three women who must deal with very adverse conditions and who have to make a living with very few means. It is at once serious and yet it allows for human dignity and inner strenght in the characters. A very good look at the strenghts of women in a very unfavorable setting.
3,Milagro,"Salvadoran author Manlio Argueta brings the lives of the common peasants of El Salvador to life in this novel. Probably part of the magical realism genre of literature, it can be confusing to read and follow, if you are new to this type of writing. Not as striking to me as his previous novel, One Day of Life, it is a nice read that takes its time getting to the heart of the matter in the lives of 3 females just after the terrible civil war."
5,Pearls of wisdom Mother Bracelet,I bought this bracelet for my mother and she loved it.Very nice and elegant.
2,"Ok, but overpriced","when this arrived, I was really disappointed. In the box it looks really cheap. However, it does look nice when it is worn. The clasp is a bit flimsy, and the shipping costs are outrageous. I would recommend you price shop a bit."
5,beautiful,I was very poeased with the merchandise. The piece was very beautiful. The recipient of the gift commented on how nice it was.
2,A Bit Cloying For Me,"I found the style of these essays to be a bit cloying, like eating too much cotton candy at the circus. Her writing lacks the sharpness of David Sedaris or the insight of Andrei Condrescu, and her bland experiences begin to run together after you've read half the book. For those who enjoy writers like Sarah Vowell or Sandra Tsing Loh, this book may do little more than make your teeth hurt."
5,I just had to weigh in!,"I started listening to Janis Jaquith's radio commentaries when I was a senior in high school and my mom would drive me to school. (we listen to an NPR station in Virginia) I just graduated from college, and I'm STILL loving her commentaries on the radio. So I was perplexed to read in the New York Times the other day that Jaquith is ""little known""! (On the other hand, maybe that's the NY establishment for you - and their disdain for all things Southern) I don't have her book in front of me at the moment (my mom gave it to me for my birthday last fall) because I keep lending it to people. But I thought it was just great. It's the kind of book I read over and over again. Well, that's my two cents' worth!"
2,Disappointed,"While Road Fools 12 is an amazing video, I am disappointed that I was not warned prior to my purchasing this product that it was an ""e-movie"" or whatever it's called. I never would have bought it had I realized that it was not available in DVD format. I don't like the idea of sitting at the computer watching this entire video, and none of the devices I own are included in Amazon's list of compatible devices that will allow me to watch this on my TV. Furthermore, there is a ""no refund"" policy on these ""e-movies,"" so I am stuck with this $15 video that I have yet to, and probably never will, watch in its entirety. This is the first negative experience I have had with Amazon and I hope they will either change their refund policies or add a warning to these kinds of videos in the future."
3,A book about real life problems but lacks soul,"I could see myself and friends of mine in parts of this book, but it did not grab me or touch me. I think when you read a book you should walk away with something. This book left me a little dissappointed."
4,A thought provoking book that captures three different views,"I really liked this book. It connected three generations, a daughter, mother, and grandmother. I thought it was interesting how the book went backwards in time. For me, as I read about each woman I got a better understanding of her and her reasons for the way she acted. This made me realize that they were good people even if earlier they weren't perceived to be. This book reinforces that you shouldn't judge people until you get to know them, and until you have an understanding of their past experiences."
5,one of the best things i've read in years,"dorris does something amazing here. he tells the story in three parts: mother, daughter, and granddaughter. we see how the same story looks completely different depending on who is telling it. each section adds another layer to the reader's understanding. a great depiction of the complicated mother-daughter relationship, the way the love is intense and yet not always seen for what it is."
1,Cursed with poor writing.,"A thoroughly pandering, sophomoric book. Pedestrian writing that insults the intelligent reader. Dorris' book rambles on with low-rent symbolism and meandering plot, resulting in nothing but drivel. I get the feeling that the book is so popular because of the large number of liberal pseudo intellectuals in the world who love anything to do with oppressed people and are too unsophisticated for Rushdie or Ellison (to name just two). Makes me wish someone would take up book burning again and start (and end) with this one."
1,An incredibly boring book,I had to read this book for a high school honors class. The book droned on and on. The main events in this book are about as likely as getting abducted by aliens i would never recomend this book.
1,It was about what?,"Where do I start with this book, first off the authour has some serious issues in regard to the relationships between children and those they should be able to trust. It is too much of a coinsidence that Michael Dorris had alegations poised against him of the same nature. Second the book goes no where it brought up all kinds of questions during the entire book that were never answered. This is a disfunctional family portrayed by a disfunctional authour. If there was zero stars I would give it that, I feel upset that I had to pay to read it."
3,"Only one holds the key, but all impact it differently...","I know that many of the people who read this book did it for English, so I don't really want to say that I did too... I read this book, and found that some of the story moves a little slowly, but for the most part there is a path that it takes, and one that is important. It strats with the youngest of the family and shows her life, and all the faults. Then goes to the Mother who shows why her daughter is that way, and how she couldn't help it. After that the Grandmother comes in, and (I really enjoyed this section...amazing) the entire story makes so much sence. I am glad I read this book, but there were times where I could've skipped a lot and still would have know the gist of it all."
4,A book to consider,"The story intertwines three generations of American Indians women. Michael Dorris depicts the hardships faced by the women and the coming of age of the youngest girl, Rayona. This book could be kind of hard to follow for some people. But the use of the truly unique charactors made this book worth reading. It is a type of book that i think would just get better every time you read it."
4,The hardships of three generation Native Americans.,"This book is an outstanding way to learn about the lifes of Native Americans. It's told in three different perspectives and three generations. It faces the hardships and struggles that they each face, each from their own point of view. This book is definitely one of the best books I have read. Learning about their life from three different people was a great way to fully understand what was happening throughout the book and how each one viewed their lives as a person. It was a brisk and easy read and I couldn't put it down. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who is interested in learning about the culture of Native Americans and how they view American society."
4,This book takes you into the lives of three generations.,"Starting with the grandchild and ending with the grandmother, you see each person's point of view and how they feel about things. With each different generation, exciting secrets are revealed. This book demonstrates that you can't judge people by first imporessions. As you are lead into the lives of the women, their feelings are revealed and you are able to sympathize with each one as you go along. This book is not like a fairy tale, but it shows life how it really is. This book is not the best book I have ever read, but it makes you think about your own life and how you are affected by the past."
4,The most interesting way of writing I have ever seen.,"Instead of telling the tale from the oldest to youngest, Micheal Dorris writes it the other way around. After you start the book you wont be able to put it down. He takes you through the minds of a grandma, daughter, and granddaughter. He leaves you waiting in suspence until the last page."
3,I had to read it for school,I had to read this book for my AP English class. It was ok I really didnt care for it but it was interesting
5,Excellent story telling,"Dorris has captured a very intrinsic feature of the Native American way of life. Not including the way native american women feel and talk, but with the men in the story who played minor roles in a major way. The interweaving of three stories of Ida, Christine and Rayona clearly reveals the way the three women actually see their lives and their situaion. Loved it....It was easy to feel the emotions of the women due to Dorris excellent narration."
4,A unique personal history spanning three generations.,"I read this book, ""Yellow Raft on Blue Water"" by Michael Dorris, for my High School US Literature class. At first I was skeptical, I thought it would just be another one of those 'cultural struggle' books, that I've read enough of. I was wrong, this book is about understanding. The characters each go through life's journey to understand where their mothers and daughters are coming from. The book is uniquely formatted, going backward in time, retelling the same story from each character's point of view. You learn each character's past, the way they lived their lives and the way others saw them live it. ""I never grew up, but I got old. I'm a woman who's lived for fifty-seven years and worn resentment like a medicine charm for forty. It hung heavier on my neck after each brief rest I took."" p. 207. The language used in this book is beautiful, the story is touching, and the characters are amazing. I highly reccomend this book."
4,Real women,"You'd never believe this book was written by a man. The feelings of these three women are incredibly realistic and insightful. Their story moved me to, I couldn't put it down. I'd recommend this book to any women, and men who can handle real women."
3,Could be better,"Michael Dorris seemed to forget that the audience that he tried to affect are young adults, not full grown adults. To me, the book was hard to understand and at times, I lost interest. Overall, I think that the author should have done a lot more to keep my interest."
4,A story told by three different generation.,Three generation of women with three different perspective but with the same settings. Told story with their own experiences and their view of one another. The best thing about this book is the hidden secrets from one another.
3,Not So Hot,While this book may have an interesting plot. the braiding becomes really annoying. It is too repetitive and has nothing to do with the book. Aside from the fact that Indians braid.
1,Why isn't there a choice for no stars?,"The ending to this book was by all means, terrible. The only reason that I finished this book was because I had to read it for school. If I didn't have to read it, I would have put it down after the climax. In my opinion, the climax was in the first chapter when you begin to wonder if Christine will actually drive off the cliff."
1,HORRIBLE,I had to read this book for school and I first thought it was ok. But the story refused to start and I was stuck with no suspense to keep me reading. My advice is not to read this book
1,This is the worst book I have ever read,"This book was so boaring it was sad. I had to read it for Adv. Americna Lit and hated every one of the 372 pages. It had no plot, no theme the characters were horribly undeveloped. It left you feeling empty and wondering why you'd wasted the time you spent reading it."
2,ADEQUATE- BARELY...,"This novel was highly descriptive, and yet I was not impressed. However, this might be due to the fact that I read this after the superior ""I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings"" by Maya Angelou and ""The Bluest Eye"" by Toni Morrison (hail Princeton alumni)."
4,I still think about this book.,"I read this book over ten years as a freshman in high school. It touched me so much that when I am in a certain mood I think about the characters. They are great characters very deep, well thought out and relateable. I think this book is great book for women of all walks of life from teen years and up."
4,A Delightful End to a Long Journey,"Ok, here's the thing (and it's a trend I've noticed among all Dorris's reviews, you need to have faith that the read will be worth the time spent. It took me a couple months of looking at it in my bookshelf before I got around to reading, and even then I found the language easy and the plot somewhat entertaining. The thing you will notice is that its quite a long read and the book, broke into 3 sections, will most likely scare you away when you find tedium in some of the passages. I stuck with it (out of respect for Erdrich's choice of husband) and found that the last two sections really sold my interest into the story, as all the loopholes are backfilled and twists in plot are revealed. My first cynical impressions at the beginning were all destroyed and I found the characters more sympathetic and relatable. Give the book a chance, it was a wonderful finish, and it was nice to read fiction that taught me something valuable."
3,"nice plot, lacks in language","Story, yes. Literary merit: not so good. I found myself reading paragraph after paragraph of typical sophomoric vocabularay, and, suddenly, there's this deep thought, as if Dorris intended it to be really secretive. Sorry! Yes, I did read this for a class in High School, but I also have a significant literary background. Sure, characterization was execellent, but it doesn't even compare to a Joseph Heller in his Catch-22. Therefore, I consider this a novel in cohesion with The Boxcar Children. It's a great read if you don't want to think."
4,Chose this for my bookclub,"I chose this book for my bookclub and we meet this coming Wednesday to review it. I was surprised to see all the reviews on here from students who HAD to read the book for English. I thought the book was well written, it was confusing at the end, to have Aunt Ida on the roof with the priest and not know what happened to her, Christine and Rayona. However, I read that Michael Dorris wrote somewhat of a sequel to this book. Maybe if you aren't made to read this book you would have enjoyed it more, I thought the characters were wonderful, that Mr Dorris captured the female pysche in each woman. Definitely glad I chose this book as the April book!"
4,A Work Of Art!,"I read this book in my Mult-Literature Class. I must say, I found it hard to put down. I loved how Michael Dorris got you into the minds of the characters. He would show how one persons point of view is different from the other ones point of view. It was really great! It's about 3 generations of women, who go through the good times and bad times, too... and really come together in the end. I loved it!"
2,Inaccurate description of condition,"I purchased the audio CDs for my classroom. Although they were described as playing well, many do not. They skip badly. It's the first Amazon purchase that has not lived up to its description."
2,Ehhhhh.....,"If you look at all of the reveiws, you will find many high-schoolers reveiwing it, and it is this way for a reason: it is high-school quality writing. Everything from heavy-handed symbolism to a near soap-opera storyline brings this down. This is like one of those young adult books. You know, the books where the author can't really write, so he makes it ""mature"" (swears alot and fills it with adult situations) to make up for it. This is one of the most overrated books since Catcher in the Rye (both books make the fatal mistake of confusing a depressed, lonely, and abandonded character with a deep character. Neither author realizes that a character with only one or two emotions, no matter what they are, is a boring character). Still, it is an easy read, so feel free to try it out......"
4,Yellow Raft in Blue Water -- audio cassette version,"This book is in 3 parts -- each told from a view point of a a different generation from the same family. This story is very poignant, for teenagers, mothers and grandmothers who often are too wound up in the present to appreciate the past. Each person's narrative gives a new perspective on why the character acts the way she does. It lends an uncommon depth to the story. I never thought that Ida's harshness could be justified but after hearing her version of the story, I understand her view. It is a melancholy story with illness, death and despair. But it is worth the time."
1,sink this raft,"Unlike most of the reviewers, I did not read this book for an English class. I'm a well-read adult who anticipated a powerful story (because of glowing reviews). I enjoyed the book up until Part III, when I thought Ida was going to tie everything together. She did no such thing. Her ""voice"" bore no resemblance to the character we met in parts I and II. Her story was a soap opera and completely unbelievable. This book was a complete waste of time."
4,Text in relation to Author,"I read this book four years ago in my Eng4 AP class and loved it. However, after reading Morning Girl, also by Dorris, in a college Children's Lit course and learning a bit about his personal life, it leads me to belive that there is a direct connection between the author and his text. This should not play a part in how one appreciates the language, but rather how one reflects on the content. It provides a different view of what is happening in the text and I think it is important to concider that view. Overall, my advice is to read the book, resurch the author and then read the book again! :)"
3,funny lots of emotions left you hanging,My co worker gave me at work said it was something i would enjoy so i read. i liked it somthings disburbed me some things i really admired respect but im curious to if she ever finds out the whole story....
3,Portrait of the Outsider at 15,"Dorris's ""Yellow Raft on Blue Water"" is less about American Indian life than about the dangers of growing up in this strange, rich, loosely-jointed society that we've built in America. Particularly when you have no help from your family. Rayona, at 15, is an outsider in the white world of Seattle because her mother is Indian and her father black. She's equally an outsider on the reservation, to which her mother returns her, because of her father and her years on the Coast. The first eight chapters, told by Rayona, are splendid. The next eight, told by her wildly irresponsible and conflicted mother, are a bit less so. The final four, in the voice of her grandmother, supply the answers to the puzzles but remain mechanical. Not a great novel but a good one with some fine passages."
2,Didn't live up to its reputation,"I had heard so many great things about this book, and had thoroughly enjoyed Michael Dorris's non-fiction work, ""The Broken Cord,"" but I couldn't finish this. It just felt like an aimless walk through a trailer park. I couldn't believe a single thing any of the characters did, and the capper was Rayona's rodeo ride."
3,Looks Interesting!,I have to write a simple composition on the content of this book. I didn't read it. I will depend on the mother information highway to assist me on my quest for a college degree. Then I will laugh at all of you.
1,Immoral and inappropriate for minors,"I am not reviewing the story. I am reviewing and warning parents about the content of this book. There are explicit sexual references, offensive slang describing the male genitalia of the girls lover, immoral adult themes, numerous uses of the ""F"" word and the ""S"" word, a priest sexually assaults the girl in the story. This book should be banned from schools. Kids get punished in school for using profanity yet the teachers are making them study this filth. What happened to studying venerated classics like Macbeth, Don Quixote, or the Iliad and Odyssey?"
3,1912 London Underworld,"An interesting book written in 1912 dealing with London and its underworld, or underclass. He includes both the criminal underworld and the poor. Well researched as he was secretary of the Howard Association, which was involved with the the London underworld. He was compassionate and caring and worked to improve the lives of the poor people as well as the criminal class. He writes well and organized the material well. He proposed steps to improve the lot of the underworld and criminals that he believed would be better for all. Unfortunately, some of what he proposed was very draconian and would force people to do as directed.Worth reading to understand the affect of grinding poverty upon people in London in the early 20th century. There was little in the way of a social safety net, and people did go hungry, and sometimes effectively starved."
2,Glorification of a murderer...,"All of the attempts to expose the rest of Wyatt Earp's life are diminished if not ruined by the blatantly false portrayal of the Earp's and Holliday as ""lawmen.""The famous ""gunfight"" was little more than cold-blooded murder carried out by the Earps, and the attempt to somehow portray the Earp's as heroes is an embarassment. The Clanton/McLaury gang were cattle rustlers, but did that justify their being gunned down in cold blood? Tom McLaury was unarmed but still shot and killed by the Earps. Ike Clanton and Billy Clairborne were both unarmed and ran away, but still the cowardly Earps took shots at them.There were no ""good guys"" in the ""gunfight"" but there were players who were more in the wrong than the other, and those were the Earps. It's too bad that this movie didn't accurately portray this."
1,Flawed ...but flawed,"Among the unintentional laughs was the dramatic walk to the OK Corral by the Earps and Doc Holliday. This should have been released as a comedy.Another flawed, but still excellent, version of the Earps was ""Tombstone."""
5,the best,the best show of wyatt earp ever made i loved it kevin is the best actor for the wyatt earp he was outstanding
3,picture quality,I found that the picture quality is above average in this transfer to blu-ray. It does not have as much of a 3 demensionl look as I have seen in other transfers but it still has more detail than the DVD. Also black levels are farily strong as well. The reason I gave it a bit of a lower rating is because the audio is not that stellar and the sourrounds are not used much also the features are not to bad but I think it could have a little more about the movie than just about the real story of Earp
5,Wyatt Earp,"Great story, star-studded. An excellant epic movie! Had to have it for my collection. A must own for any western movie buff!"
4,Great Movie,"A little drawn out, but still an awesome movie. Dennis Quaid is really good as Doc Holliday!!! I think it is actually better than Tombstone."
4,"Not accurate, but a good one just the same.","If your wanting to see a truly accurate portrayal of Wyatt, keep waiting as it hasn't been made yet (and knowing Hollywood it never will). But seeing Dennis Quaid's portrayal of Doc Holliday is worth it alone. I've heard people say this is more accurate than Tombstone but each movie has about the same amount of goofs. It's incredible that a movie made on an epic scale couldn't figure out a way to show Virgil and Morgans' shootings on different nights! (They happened three months apart)"
3,Blu Ray,"I bought this when it was offered for $7.99 and on that basis I would say its great value for almost 3 hours of viewing. However I felt it wasnt as gripping as I expected. It was drawn out even though I love long sagas but found myself somewhat bored. But for what I paid for it I have no complaint. The transfer was good. Extras was a bit lacking. I would have liked to see more on the research and history of Wyatt. Id say for current price, add it to your basket but wait till it goes for what I paid for it before buying.If you found my words helpful at all, please vote on it. Thanks."
5,The best and most historical dramatization of Wyatt Earp,"This is by far the number one picture of Wyatt Earp ever made. It deals with his entire life and not just what he is most famous for. The attention to detail is spectacular! His history, as is that of his family, puts a real spin on the name Earp. It shows why he became the man he was and where that fearlessness came from. The score to the film is some of Howard's best work. It is energetic and fun when it should be and dramatic and moving when it has to be. A definite plus."
2,Wyatt Earp Not better then Tombstone..IMO,"Well This film is well typical for A Costner flick, Like most of his films around this time it is long (To long) and it is almost painful to watch. This Director decided to focus on the ""Dark Side"" of Wyatt Earp and it told the story that Tombstone did not while many would disagree with me I think this film is just as fictional as Tombstone only this film takes longer to reach the same conclusion.Not only is the film rather long but you get the same acting from Kevin Costner as you got with other films that came out in the 90's with costner in them (EX. Dances with Wolves). I did like some of Costers films but this one kinda made me mad with the poor acting and long drawn out story.IMO I would pass on this film expecialy if your looking for a action film Tombstone dose have alot more action and also has a little better acting....Of corse this is all IMO..."
2,Disappointed,"I own the VHS two disc version of this, and was very excited when this came out. I purchased it thinking it was the extended edition, but it was just the normal version with deleted scenes that were in the VHS version. I ended up giving this away. BEWARE!!!! If you want the extended version, it is only available on VHS."
2,"Maybe more realistic, but not as good","Much of the movie is a snore...it might be more historically accurate, but doesn't compare to Tombstone in terms of entertainment value. Buy this movie if you like the monotonous details of a history class, but not for the intensity that is so addictive in other movies. Dennis Quaid as Doc Holliday is particularly not worth writing home about, which is disappointing due to the very colorful nature of the real Doc. Better to save your ($) and 3 hours on something better."
2,Okay movie...but...,"Wyatt Earp is an okay movie...but Quaid's performance as Doc Holliday is laughable and has put me off not only this movie but all Dennis Q's movies forever!Oh, and I have to mention-How long is this movie?!If you'd like to see a real movie about Wyatt Earp and Doc Holliday-See Tombstone!"
2,"Rent ""Tombstone"" instead","This movie is entertaining, but not as good as ""Tombstone"" which was released about the same time. Kostner's Earp comes off somewhat flat and the script, while giving a hard, authentic look at life in the wild west, lacks the snap of ""Tombstone."" Recommend it instead for the better casting (especially Val Kilmer as Doc Holliday and Sam Elliott)"
5,One of my favorite western movies of all time.,"This movies is worth watching on the big screen. And I don't mean the multiplex type of big screens. This movie is really awesome on one of those older movie theatres with the extra large projection screens. The movie is simply amazing. The characters are well played and the storyline is fantastic. It's a longish movie but that's the time required to tell this story. If you have'nt seen it and like the wild west and it's history, then this is a movie definitely worth watching. Kevin Costner is excellent, probably his best movie."
5,Exceptional Western,"I know there are detractors of both this movie and Kevin Costner but I'm not one of them. It is longer and more historically accurate than Tombstone but just as well made. It also features a more realistically stoic portrayal of Earp by Costner and an ""I'm no slouch at playing Doc myself"" performance by the unrecognizable Dennis Quaid who would have been the measuring stick had Val Kilmer not been otherwordly as Doc. This film also features a GREAT ensemble cast much like Tombstone and it amazes me how two separate casts can hit such a home run on the same topic. A must own if you are a western fan."
1,wyatt earp dvd,did not receive the movie only the case. there was another movie in the case that was not wyatt earp's. i had a bad experience.
5,Very close to the REAL Wyatt Earp,This was a very good & factual(mostly)story of Wyatt & his bro's! Enjoyed the authentic clothing & language. Excellant movie
3,OK Western!,The reason I gave it an OK was Kevin Costners acting. He acts the same in every movie he makes...wooden. On the bright side was Dennis Quaids portrayal of Doc Holiday. Great acting Dennis!!
2,Tombstone a better picture,Admirable as this attempt was the movie Tombstone was a much better picture. Val Kilmer was awesome as Doc Holliday and Quaids performance is strained and hammy in comparison. The entire cast was excellent and the film had a better quality troughout.
2,"Interesting portrayl, but it goes nowhere fast.","Kostner had the right idea initially, but after a while it gets tedious. While Quaid and Kostner do alright, one wonders about the rest of the cast. Harmon seems better suited to play Johnny Ringo than the ineffectual no-namer that does. Interesting to see a less than heroic portrayl of Earp (he's a good guy, yes, but a cold blooded killer as well), but that's all this film has."
2,Only Costner Would Make A Great Story So Boring,"This movie was a huge waste of time. Buy ""Tombstone,"" instead. It's a 5-Star!"
3,Buyer Beware,"I bought this 2 disk set expecting a new product and maybe it was originally how ever there was a razor cut which went all the way through the outside of the cardbord cover to the inside where the dvd was, just missing the playing surface of the dvd. the distributor of this product did a lousey job of removing a lable which was mostlikely dammaged by the razor cut and placed the barcode and a new label over the cut as to hide or cover up the razor cut so you could not see it untill it was unwrapped at witch point the product would not be returnable for a refund. Amazon you have poor quality contol. thankfully the dvds apear to be undamaged. I only payed $10.00 for the product including the shipping. I will have to decide whether I will continue to shop at Amazon in the future.Wyatt Earp (Two-Disc Special Edition)"
3,Wyatt Earp dvd,"Wyatt Earp dvd came unharmed and in good time. I haven't played it yet, so don't know about it's playability.Peggy Stoll"
2,GONE BERSERK ...,"After winning a lot of Oscars for the great ""DANCE WITH WOLVES"", Costner apparently wente berserk, and started to think he's the greatest actor of all mankind! One of the movies that shows this new phase is this one. The general idea is good, tryin to make a ""real"" portrait of Wearp, not a action-filled package as ""TOMBSTONE"". But Costner's acting is arrogant, boring, in a way that eclypses all the merits of the movie (mainly, Dennis Quaid as Doc Holliday)"
1,UNABLE TO WATCH,I BOUGHT IT FOR MY BLUE RAY UPDATED THE SOFTWARE AS THE INSERT SUGGESTED AND IT STILL IS NOT RECOGNIZING THE DISC...IT SUCKED...BECAUSE IT WAS A GIFT FOR MY GIRLFRIEND...=0(
3,Wyatt Earp with Kevin Costner,"This movie is more a biography of Wyatt Earp than a simple retelling of the OK Corral shootout story. It starts with the lead-in to the OK Corral, then flashes back to Wyatt as a young boy planning to run away to fight in the civil war with his two older brothers. It shows Wyatt as taking over leadership of the Earp brothers and as a frustrated businessman along with the many things Wyatt did to end up a lawman-gunfighter. The defining event in his life in the movie is the loss of his wife, which colors all of his subsequent actions from mugging a man to stealing a horse to hunting buffalo, etc. Dennis Quaid is outstanding as Doc Holliday as is Kevin Costner as Wyatt Earp. I would have given this 4 and a half stars had it been edited down to about two hours and forty-five minutes. It is too long. Lots of very good actors and a big story though."
3,EASYRIDER,"In the beginning it was very slow going and i couldn't help but think that it wasn't Costners best work by a long shot! In fact the early scenes of Kevins seemed ""stiff"" and very amateur, but, don't give up it picks up drastically later on and becomes a very entertaining piece. The stand out performance in this film is given by Dennis Quaid who gave his heart and soul to the part of the sickly ""Doc Holliday"" who was dieing of tuberculosis. Dennis lost an incredible 43 pounds for the part to appear ""sickly"", and it worked!"
4,Wyatt Earp,"I like this as a companion piece to the more entertaining but less historically accurate Tombstone. Thought Quaid did a fine job as Holliday and Costner an effective Earp, who was actually probably a lot less likeable than he has been portrayed."
5,Really Enjoyed This Hollywood Epic ...,"I really enjoyed this, capital 'H', Hollywood historical epic film and fully expect I'll return to it from time to time. CaseyTefertiller's book 'Wyatt Earp' helped make this epic depiction much more fun for me as I could link and look forward and back on the TONS of missing detail that the film simply hasn't the time to include. For all that, this is an outstanding movie. If you're a western/Tombstone fan, history buff, etc, get your spurs on and spend 3 hours in the 1800's. GREAT film!"
3,"Ok, but it's not Tombstone","Wyatt Earp was ok, but it just doesn't measure up to Tombstone, the movie about the same subject which was released one year earlier.Pros: This movie covers all of Earp's life and allows us to see him develop more as a character, especially in regard to his wife and the woman he lived with for most of his life before the city of Tombstone.Cons: The musical score seemed very repetitive and less-than-impressive. Kevin Costner and Dennis Quaid simply do not compare to the Tombstone performances of Kurt Russell and Val Kilmer (Even though I do not think that Kilmer is that great of an actor, his role as Doc Holiday is one of the best characters I have seen on screen).In comparison, I'd give this movie 2 or less stars, but judging it on its own, I have to give it at least 3, if for no other reason, for its grand scale."
5,One of the best westerns,Wyatt Earp is a great western. Great acting. Nice to see it in Blu-ray. Sound and picture was great. This is a must see movie before watching Tombstone. I recommend buying them both.
4,History vs Hollywood,"I won't go into detail of either film since others have already done that.In every way Wyatt Earp is far more historically accurate.Although I'm no Costner fan I thought he did a fairly good jobas well as the rest of the cast, Dennis Quaid was very good.History is usually less exciting than hollywood would have us think.Val Kilmore's ""Doc"" was over the top for me, especially when he fired 3 shots insuccession from a double barrel shot gun , ""happens alot in westerns"".If you want snappy dialog with a bunch of ""pretty people"" go with Tombstone.If you want the grimness and a more accurate portrayalof the life and events of Wyatt Earp then choose, well... you know."
5,Wyatt Earp,"This was a fantastic addition to my collection. I am normally a sci-fi/horror fan. There are however some westerns that I really enjoy, and this is one of them.I purchased this item through Amazon. I really meant to give it a 5-star rating when it came in and looked at it. Being new to this, I made a mistake and gaveit a 3-star."
2,Good,Atkinson does a very good job of objective history writing even though in this case his overall perspective was limited to a specific combate area. He did stray a little with his personnel thoughts but is still an excellent writer of military history.
1,Political opinion? Say it an't so !,"It's sad that the author devoted so much of the book to his arrogant and condescending attitude. Its clear that his purpose was to get his political opinion across on the backs of American soldiers. He was ""embedded"" alright, right up to his shoulders."
2,Too much political opinion,I bought this book wanting to learn something of the 101st's drive to Baghdad. Having listened to years of political tripe I find the author's parroting of Doomacrat political posturing games to be a fatal flaw to this work.
2,Attitudes and Prejudices Show Through,"I am a real fan of Rick Atkinson and have read his two books on World War II with great enjoyment. This book, however, was a major disappointment.Atkinson's hatred of the Bush administation and conservative news sources comes through in many places. This is so strong that it colors his view of the events he is narrating. He never seems to understand, nor does he have much contact with the common soldier. This is simply his views of his own experience in the conflict. Most of the time he was in well-protected HQ compounds. He has a jest made in poor taste about having found the ""weapons of mass destruction""; a box of box-cutters.The most interesting and significant part of the book is his positive description of Genral Petreus."
1,Stick to the facts please,"I picked up this book at the library and glad I didn't pay good money for it. I expected to get an unbiased view of the front lines from the perspective of the normal foot soldier. Instead I got only the perspective from the commanding general, boring. The real combat was miles away. I also got the impression that the author of this book was more than happy to stick his nose up the general's behind and make the impression that the general highly respected him. Maybe so, but I doubt it.Rick makes several factually incorrect statements in this book at the expense of the Bush administration. Rick misses no opportunity to get his digs on the Bush administration. This is ok as long as the information is factual but it isn't.The bottom line is if you want a 10,000 foot view of the war, like to hear someone repeatedly pat himself on the back and hate Bush you'll love this book. Otherwise I recommend War Stories from Oliver North as a much better read."
1,Don't bother,"From reading this book I find it hard to believe this author won a Pulitzer. Other than some inside observation of General Petreaus, a man I admire and respect, I hated this book. The writing style is boorish and boring. Atkinson is in love w/himself. I really don't have much to add, the other negative reviews pretty much sum it up. Glad I didn't pay for this book."
4,In the Company of Soldiers,"Atkinson, author (among others) of An Army at Dawn, was an imbedded reporter with the 101st Airborne Division as it deployed into Iraq and onward toward Baghdad in March and April of 2003. Atkinson reports from the side of division commander Major General David Howell Petraeus, so this account is more from the view of the command post than the fields of battle."
3,"Unprofessional, but worthwhile","Although I haven't read any other books by Rick Atkinson, I have no doubt that he is an excellent writer, but in this case, he let his personal feelings of disdain for the Bush administration overshadow his professionalism. In some cases, for instance the latrine grattiti, he purposely distorts the attitudes of our military troops to make his point ""that President Bush deceived the American public."" He had a unique opportunity to really show what it is like to be an American soldier in combat, but he fell short. I say this because I've spent over 20 years in the US Military and have been very heavily involved for the past three years with Operation Enduring Freedom and Iraqi Freedom. The troops out here have been and still are very excited about helping the Iraqis to share the same freedoms we have in America. Many of the troops I deal with daily volunteer to extend because they feel they're making a difference and they enjoy the challenges of the combat environment."
3,"""The March Up"" is a far better book","Atkinson's book is far more about his experience as an embedded reporter than a work of military history. There is virtually no discussion of tactics, and his contact was limited mostly to the division commander and his staff, with little input from the soldiers on the point of the spear. This book does not approach the standard of An Army At Dawn.By contrast, The March Up explains how the Marines actually fought the Iraqis, and is more about the Marine infantrymen than about the author or the brass."
2,In company of Remington Raiders ... BORING,"I've read other books by Atkinson, which were great. This one though well written from an English literature point of view, is BORING. Sorry. I read the whole thing waiting to get really interested, but it never happened. Following the Divisional HQ around isn't much different than reading about corporate america. Not why I read military oriented books. Look at others. Too many other great books out there to read. Pick wisely; not this."
3,"Should be titled ""In the Company of Generals""","This book is really a very well written diary of the author'sexperience with the 101st Airborne Division in the 2003 invasion of Iraq. The book focuses on the commanders of the Division with not as much written about the common soldier. It certainly gives an insight to what modern warfare is like from a general's point of view in a horrible environment. The author has a very annoying habit of periodically using uncommon words. Its nice to know that his vocabulary rivals that of William F. Buckley, but these oddball nouns and adjectives often slows the flow of the story. This book is not as good as ""An Army at Dawn"" and I would not give it as a gift, but it is worth the time to read it."
2,Good Writing - Bad Politics,"The author spared no punches at constantly giving his personal disapproving opinion on the politics of this war. It almost reads as a Democratic Campaign leaflet against the Bush Administration's war in Iraq. It is horribly biased against the reasons for going to war. Atkinson makes it a point in almost every chapter to show how wrong and inept the Bush Administration's policies are. In the author's impressions of casual conversations, the attitude of the young men and women in the 101'st appear to also be very negative as to the reasons they are in Iraq and fighting the war. I would not recommend this book if you supported the war in Iraq.I highly recommend:""The March Up: Taking Baghdad with the 1st Marine Division""""None Braver: U.S. Air Force Pararescuemen in the War on Terrorism"""
3,In The Company Of Generals,"I read this book because I had heard good things about the author (Atkinson). It was a decent chronicle of the 101st's invasion of Iraq. However, it focused mostly on the strategy of the war and not the actual execution. It would have been nice to know what was going on at the lower levels of command. Also, the vocabulary was a bit obscure. I found it to be a little intellectually elitist. Finally, he should probably have kept his political digs out of the book. For instance, he comments that WMD have not been found. Iraq is a big place and they still might be found. Even if there are none, it just seems to be an out of place commentary."
3,A bit disappointed ...,"I had read the ""Army At Dawn"" book before I had purchased and read this particular book. I really enjoyed the story telling of the North African campaign and had thought Mr. Atkinson would have done something similar for this book. I was wrong. My main complaint with the book is the choppiness in which it goes to tell the story. Having served in both Afghanistan and Iraq, I laughed at some his stories (AAFES and the missing chocolate cookie), cried specifically when he briefly details the letters soldiers were getting from home, and anguish at the breakdowns in communications when a task is at hand. The story telling was not cohesive and made the book like at times reading a personal diary focused on one day at a time and not connected to either the days before or after."
5,Understanding the Soldier,"Well written, easy to ready, definitely an eye-opener: I had no idea the condition that have to be endured and the stamina that must be maintained to survive the environment alone, ever mind the war! I can better understand my friends and family who have served there. Would recommend this book."
5,Possibly the best sports sim. ever.,"This game, although it has a few minor flaws, is easily the best sports sim on the market right now, and ranks up there with classics such as Earl Weaver Baseball, Front Page Sports Football and Madden.The game play, especially the batter/pitcher matchup are almost perfect. The ability to move fielders and make plays is excellent. And, the all around feel is like playing in a real game.Minor stat errors and a fairly poor minor league system take a way from the game a little but, but these items can easily be fixed with 3rd party applications available on the internet on High Heat user sites.If you have a fast connection, online play is worth triple the price you pay for this game! There is nothing like playing an actual person in a tight game. Online player rankings are also available and used for this game.Although EA's Triple Play has fancier graphics, the gameplay and realisticness of High Heat makes Triple Play seem like the old Atari basball from the 1970's."
4,This game is perfect for what I am looking for.,This is my 1st High Heat game and I have had it for only 3 days and I love it. This game is great for someone who wants to be a manager and not really play the game. (I don't have a joystick so I haven't been able to play the game.) But the GM mode and the minor leagues allow you to do all of the things that a manager would do like manage rosters and develop players in the minors. I had Triple Play 2000 and it was terrible compared to this game.
1,Great game when it doesn't crash,"Probably the best baseball game out there in terms of statistical realism, graphics, features, etc., but it constantly crashes, even with the patches that are provided on the 3DO web site, tweaking PC settings, etc. It's brutally annoying and frustrating to have to save the game every 1/2 inning, and constantly restart the PC when it crashes. 3DO offers a community bulletin board and free email, too, but this customer service can not overcome the overall lack of stability."
2,It's so real! (Yeah right),"In the commercial Sammy claims that his game is ""...so real."" I beg the differ, this game is o.k. but all the hype is cheap. The gameplay may be good but where it counts (graphics) this game falls short."
3,Apparently one of the only people not,"To be sure, High Heat is a decent baseball game.But I don't find the interface between batter and pitcher THAT muchbetter than others, and I really have hard time getting past the truly substandard graphics, the choppy gameplay (NOT my system), and the listless commentary. This game is fine, . . . but this game does not revolutionize baseball sims as we know it. I was disappointed...all the reviews and hype say this is the tops. It just didn't live up..it's the Phantom Menace of baseball sims!"
2,Not so realistic after all,"I bought this game because I did not like hitting 50 home runs in 20 games in that other baseball simlulation (you know what I mean). So after the great reviews I had read about it, I gave SSHHBB a try, but I'm really disappointed. The game suffers from some sort of ""keep scores close"" programming when you play against cpu controlled teams. Once the human player starts scoring, the cpu controlled team suddenly hits everything. Example: David Cone hitting a homer of a Kerry Wood curve ball that was out of the strike zone low and away. Realistic? Give me a break! Besides the game crashes everytime you try to perform a double switch."
5,INCREDIBLE!,"I first got the demo out of a Computer Gaming World magazine, and loved it! I played it with all my friends and they loved it too. When I got the game, I was very excited. i installed it and the game wass amazing! it had all the teams and had great graphics. I am really impressed with Sammy Sosa high heat baseball 2001!"
5,Beautiful sounds,"Wanting an excellent CD of traditional Indian music, but being a novice, I chose this based on the hope that the title didn't lie. It didn't, this is a wonderful and expressive CD, each song starts slow and simple then builds to an exuberant ending. It is relaxing and playful to the ear and mind."
1,I LOVE ALI A. KHAN....BUT..............................,"......I do not love this cd......as I am sure I should....the quality simply [...]......I do not know if it's just my copy, or what....but it seems as if this was recorded in a cardboard box using vintage Radio Shack dynamic microphones, circa 1959.The digital remastering did little to enhance my copy..........."
5,INCREDIBLE! ONLY IN YOUR WILDEST DREAMS COULD THIS BE POSSIBLE!,"This CD is the kind of thing you dream about! I love 'The Little Rascals' and the music was always memorable. Usually I collect original recordings only, but this is actually better than having the original recordings. The Beau Hunks have done a very special and incredible tribute to the Rascal's music. By using period instruments and microphones this band has painstakingly put together perfect reproductions of the original songs minus crackles,pops and production standards from the 1920's and 30's! It's nothing short of amazing and the CD is loaded to boot! I'm glad I bought this when it was in print. There was a second disc release called 'On With The Show' Which includes another 50 tracks of the remaining material. This is a fantastic disc!"
5,A Trip Down Memory Lane,When I first heard this album it brought back fond memories of my childhood when I would watch the little rascals or Laurel & Hardy. The music was used in just about all of Hal Roach's shorts.The Beau Hunks really did a wonderful job recreating all this music! If you are a fan of these classic comedies by all means buy this cd.
4,great game but BIG problem,"loved this game had alot of fun making characters and trying out the different abilities.BUT one HUGE problem for me and i know there is other like me and have the same problem.this is a 3rd person game but for some reason it does to me what ONLY first person shooters do, and that is cause MASSIVE migraines, bad eye strain, and nausea.and this game caused it to me 10x worse than i've ever had before, i even tried using motion sickness pills didn't help, and lasted days after i stopped playing it.so if you have the same problems as me stay away from this game, but if you have no trouble playing first person shooters then you should have no problems.there is no gear in this game to farm endless hours for btw its all about the fun and it was :)"
4,"TEENEY TOME, TEENEY DOGS, BIG HEART AND SOUL","The title is all wrong: Yes, these pooches are lightweights (in the sense that they weigh so very little), but canine conisueers will find Sharon Montrose's photos weighing in with lotsof cute, captivating charm. This slim volume features color and sepia-toned portraits of puppies snapped during the first weeks of their lives ...most keeping company with vintage or antique scales ... and all of them are simply the cat's meow! There's Lola, an 8 week-old tea cup Chihuahua, weighing in at 14 ounces. There' Scooter and Lily, a 22-pound, 6-ounce snoozing Weimaraner combo whose faces might possibly send William Wegman heading for a phone book. And there's Lurch, a 14-pound, 8-ounce brindle Dane, who, even at 8 weeks, promises to grow (and quickly) into a precious gentle giant. Montrose is not only gifted behind the lens, but in front as well, since she has managed to capture the spirits and spunk of each pampered pooch."
3,great book....poor quality,I ordered 3 of these books as gifts for friends. All three were listed as new and in perfect condition. One of the three was missing its jacket cover and there was grease and dirt smugged over the cover. NOT AS DESCRIBED!! Don't order from this seller!!!The book itself is a wonderful collection of puppy pics of many different breeds. First saw at my vet's office and had to have.
5,very impressive!,"I discovered this gem at the same place I discovered Sun Ra's ""Cosmic Tones for Mental Therapy"" and Pat Metheny's ""Letter from Home"" (two of my favorite jazz recordings): namely the Santa Clara Public Library. This recording has Freddie Hubbard, Joe Henderson, and Bobby Hutcherson (all jazz legends) playing so well together and backed by the hard driving rhythm section of Larry Klein, Steve Houghton, and Billy Childs. It was recorded live at the Keystone Korner in San Francisco back in 1981, and must have been quite a memorable show for anyone who attended. I must say that this recording made me fans of all six musicians, especially Bobby Hutcherson and Freddie Hubbard, who at the time may have been the most technically proficient at their instruments (vibes and trumpet respectively). My favorite tracks include ""Littlest One of All"", the hard driving latin-tinged ""Intrepid Fox"", and the smooth ""Sky Dive"". ""Birdlike"" seems like an obvious tribute to Charlie Parker."
5,"Powerful, useful tool","This works great as a driver and as a drill. The power is controlled by the pressure on the trigger. I use it with an extension cord to make up for the short cord. After having bought other drivers, this will probably be the final drill or electric driver I will ever buy."
3,drill driver,"I have had several cordless drill drivers. Even with modest use (less than once a month) the charging has failed after a few years, and there is no recourse at that point.I ordered this because it is wall-powered. With a 20 foot high quality cord, I am able to use it anywhere on my property.I am able to use it where it fits; most places a cordless would fit.The only down side is that the finger speed control, while good, is not as fine as on a cordless.For now, I stay with this one."
1,Broken after about 10 uses,"This drill no longer works after about 10 uses. I was using it pretty hard to drill large deep holes in wood and it appears that something in the drive connection to the chuck has broken. It is difficult to tell exactly which part has broken since the breakage prevents me from removing the chuck. There is a particular component that I suspect to be the problem. When I went online to see if I could buy this part, I found that every part EXEPT this one was available. The part that I think has failed is on backorder for a couple of months. While I'm not definitive that this is the problem, I do find this suspicious. I'll go with some other brand in the future."
4,Gets the job done.,"Stanley continues to make a good basic wood chisel at a reasonable cost. It came pretty much ready to use. Since I was doing a fairly nice piece of furniture, I wanted the edge as true and sharp as possible. Just a little effort with the ""scary sharp"" system got it that way. The job I applied this chisel to was with white oak. A previous experience with this chisel's 1/2"" big brother was with white pine.Neither application was particularly stressful on the tools but when I had finished with several cuts there were a few tiny nicks in the edge of each of them. White oak is medium hard. White pine is not. Did not expect the nicks.However, they did do the job and I expect they will remain at the ready for future projects. And for the money this was not an investment in heirlooms or ""designer"" tools. So I would recommend them for every day work."
5,Improved,"Bought this chisel as I needed one quickly for my fence project rebuild. A heck of a lot of notching in green wood!Had an inch and a half stanely I purchased around two years ago. I sometimes don't like the new and ""improved"" designs, but this is a plus!!!!The tang goes through the handle. Because of this design improvement, I had excellent ergonomics and I moved through the many new fence posts with relative ease. My friend moved much slower.My other stanley chisel worked well. This one works better.There is no mention of how hard the metal is in this chisel, and I am hoping that this too is an improvement. Especially in sharpening and continuing to maintain an edge.All in all, a pleasant suprise as I purchased it on-line rather in a store."
2,"Very basic, quick read","I'm planning on purchasing my first serger and bought this to get a rundown on what serger's can and can't do and what to look for when buying, as well as a general user's guide for once I bought one. While this book touches on a lot of topics, it's such a minimal amount that it's laughable! The ""chapter"" on which serger to buy is two pages - one of which is almost entirely a black and white sketch of a basic serger with it's parts labeled. This book is in dire need of photographs...you know what they say, a picture is worth a thousand words!It touches on a lot of subjects, but when the book is only 128 pages (about 3/8"" thick), how much information can it really have?? I wish I'd paid better attention to the book's details before I purchased."
3,"Good Information, Dated Projects","I found the information in this book very useful after first getting a serger. I found the book to be extremely dated and would never even consider making any of the projects listed. With this book, plus your serger manual, you'll be using your serger in no time. I just wish they would make a completely updated version of this book."
5,Sergering without fear,"This book was very helpful, for me and the students I teach. Very detailed will recommend this to everyone that uses a serger."
3,book,It is full of good information but it could use a few more pictures on threading the machine. But I found it helpful.
4,Good book,I got this with my serger to help and it did. It's pretty easy to read and follow along with.
2,Too dated and if you have a decent manual you don't need this book.,"The first 8 chapters of this book are in your owners manual. Chapter 1 (what is a serger), Chapter 2 (which one to buy), Chapter 3 (thread and threading), Chapter 4 (cutting your pattern) chapter 5-8(curved seams,securing ends, sewing order and, tension balance) all already in my manual. Chapters 9-20 get a little more interesting but seems a little dated. There are tips on how to make a leotard, stirrup pants and leg warmers. First copyright is from 1985 not its not improved much in the third edition. I would have enjoyed some better pictures too. If you have a decent manual this really isn't the book for you. For me it was too dated and too basic."
1,DEFINITELY not the book it should be!,"What a disappointment! There is nothing in this book that hasn't been done and done MUCH better in other books. There are next to no instructions on techniques. For example, under the section ""Gathers"" there are exactly 2 SMALL paragraphs that tell you it can be done on a serger, but basically the only instructions on how to do it are ""tighten your tension"". It tells you you can gather over cord, but doesn't tell you how. As mentioned in other reviews there are no actual pics, just line drawings that are of little to no help. I was astonished when I read some of the glowing reviews written by others, and had to check 3 times to make sure we were talking about the same book. Personally I found this book pretty much useless; your money is far better spent buying Serger Secrets!"
3,It's Helpful,"Something about this book. It's a good little book. However, it goes into machine performance and all of that should be covered in your Serger manual. So to me it was wasted space and information. It had helpful idea's. But I felt like I was reading a dated book. If you can get past the dated looking pictures there is a good amount of information in this book. They touch on serging aerobic, swimwear, lingerie, lace, and other areas also. It's written to were you can understand it. If you are a beginner and just bought a serger this book will be of help. I did refer to it when I was applying elastic for the first time. And have referred to other times also. I do keep it close to my machines."
3,A Lot of Stuff in a Little Book,"For a pocket size book there is a lot packed in here. I do however agree with the other reviewer that some of it is dated. IMHO there is an overriding fascination with ""decorative"" overlocking. Thank goodness most of that has gone the way of rugs knit out of old breadbags. I would have liked to have seen a compendium of modern techniques focused on getting a good finished look similar to RTW instead of just an edge that is easy and won't ravel but looks ""homemade.""An argument can be made as to whether or not the generic serger info should be included when it's in the manuals for the individual machines. I kind of skipped over that part tho it seems like some of the info might be useful to people who don't have a manual or have a poorly written one, especially on a basic machine."
5,"Can't Disagree, Can Clarify.","All the above statements are true, except for the small but very important misidentification of the musician playing pedal steel. That man, one of the greatest steel players of all time -- turning in one of the greatest live steel performances to ever hit tape, is Lloyd Green.Beautiful and essential."
5,Beautifully illustrated and well written travel book,"Sea Change is an enthralling journey with the author as she overcomes fears to sail from East to West Scotland. Mairie writes with sensitivity, evoking memories for anyone who has ever sailed. Her beautiful watercolours and drawings are the icing on the cake."
4,Unique and attractive,I bought this tie tack as a gift for my husband and I am very pleased with it! The colors are much more vibrant than they are in the picture and the acrylic coating protects the tie tack as well as giving it a nice shine. I am sure that my husband will get many positive compliments when he wears it!
3,"Good size, somewhat flimsy","I needed a really big plant saucer for an indoor lemon tree. This was the only one on amazon large enough, as far as I could tell. When it arrived, it had several cracks in it down the sides. Of course, the box that it arrived in looked like it had been thrown off a moving truck on the highway, so I'm sure most saucers won't arrive cracked. However, it did demonstrate that the thing wasn't the most resilient I had ever seen. I needed it right away and didnt want to send it back, so I fixed up the cracks with some packing tape, and it seems to be holding water.I used this for theGarden Odyssey 25-Inch Whiskey Barrel Planter, Worn Iron, also sold by Amazon. It does fit, but feels as though it might be crushing the thing a bit. All in all, I'd prefer something a lot thicker, but this seems to be the only choice so far for such large planters."
5,"This is the best flip flop in the world,...",I got 10 pairs at a site called Igapost.com. These things rock!
3,A father to remember!,"""The last song"" is a disturbing but honest film based -if you may- on a thousand times told story: the powerful emotional barrier between father and daughter who avoid them to establish a standard relationship. She is a talented pianist who refused to play, while he lives tormented and isolated due two reasons. The summer holiday will become for them genesis and nemesis and will carve in relief their differences and approaches.The love for music will be the driving force that eventaully will tie them again, when love makes its appearance at the service of redemtion and forgiveness.Greg Kinnear gives a touching performance as the dying father, but the flaw is Miley Cyrus' performance, flat and inexpressive. The splendid photograph and an agile script save and enhance this summer movie."
4,Great movie!,"The Last Song was a great movie. Lots of great Tybee Island, Georgia scenery and just a great job in acting by Miley Cyrus. I really did not expect this movie to be good at all, and I watched it merely because it was filmed where I live, but was pleasantly surprised by the story content, and the acting. My husband even enjoyed it, so it is not just a chick flick. I would encourage anyone to watch it and my purchase will allow it to become part of my movie library. Thanks. Amazon!"
2,The Last Song,"I really didn't like this DVD of Miley Cyrus.She learned to play the piano was good. She can sing. She can act. She actually is a very talented young lady, but this is too young to do these types of movies for a young girl."
5,THE LAST SONG,"GREAT MOVIE, SHE'S GROWING UP TO BE A REALLY GOOD ACTRESS. THE MOVIE CAME REALLY FAST, THANKS!"
1,AWFUL!!,This movie was TERRIBLE. I can't believe it ranks in at a 4/5. If I could give it zero stars I would. Miley's acting is at an all time low. She is totally unrealistic as a brooding rebellious teenager. The acting by newcomer Liam Hemsworth is ever worse. But even the best of actors couldn't have saved this movie because the writing was God awful. It's hard to believe this is coming from the guy who wrote The Notebook and A Walk to Remember. He seems to have gotten lazy and been thinking more about popping out movies and racking in the dough. I rented this movie for a DOLLAR and still felt like I was ripped off. DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE.
2,Read the book!,"The movie was okay, but having read the book it was a million times better. I am not knocking the actors. The book just has more time to fully develop the characters and the story, the movie felt rushed and like it was missing a lot. I barely shed a tear while watching the movie, unlike the rest of the Nicholas Sparks movies, but cried for the last 60 pages of the book and I never cry from books."
2,It could have been alot better,"I gave this two stars because it was not well put together. Seeing the trailer, it looks like great movie but after I saw it, I was bitterly disappointed because the movie was all over the place, poor character development, no chemistry, random scenes. It's supposed to be a love story right? Or at least I expected it to be, but the relationship between Ronnie and Will is not any different from everyday life that you see with teenagers. Everything felt forced. What is good about this movie?--The movie trailor, the movie cover, the music video, beautiful people, and the scenery. It would have been alot better if she sang a song in the movie or something. There wasn't anything special about this movie. ..."
3,Hannah Montana in a Soap Opera!!!,"It's just another stereotypical teenage drama movie. Everybody is so melodramatic, that it's actually funny. This movie goes all over the place; one minute, Miley Cyrus loves her new boyfriend, and the next, she's mad at him, and then goes back to loving him...it's crazy! Cyrus plays Veronica ""Ronnie"" Miller, who is rebellious and forced to spend time with her dad and brother. (This is kinda important; she used to play the piano, but ever since her parents split up, she stopped playing) During her time with daddy, she finds sea turtle eggs, and decides to help save them from raccoons. The last thirty minutes is when you will need your tissues. If you keep a very open mind, you might like THE LAST SONG!!!"
1,Assassination of Sparks,"I read the book from Nicholas sparks some time ago ,which is a great book with unique love ,rare description of characters , of thought ,way of life, 4.8 out of 5.The film does not resemble the book in most of its topics, the story is twisted around ,the cast does not fit the characters described in the book at all, performing and selection of cast to the film is out of place and their acting is shameful and miserable.I read Dear John before seeing the film and I saw it 4 times thereafter ,a great performance a great acting geniuses selection of participants-Amanda Seyfried is brilliant and so is John's father and the rest of a crew,5.1 out of 5The director July Ann Robinson and screenplay Jeff Van Wie needs to look for a different job.This film is a shameful feature to the his !"
1,Sparks strikes again,"While she may have her name above the title, calling The Last Song a Miley Cyrus movie is a bit misleading. The pop star is certainly the lead actress in the movie - and to be honest she does a good enough job in it - but the true genre of this film is a ""Nicholas Sparks Movie.""So if you go bring plenty of Kleenex to wipe the tears from your eyes, although whether they are tears of sadness or tears of boredom will depend on how easily you fall for the author's claptrap in the first place.[...]"
1,*Yawn*,"I was looking forward to see this movie but it was a disappointment. The storyline was good, but the acting just didn't do it for me. The acting wasn't compelling or believable. For one, Ronnie gets upset at her boyfriend and says ""I don't want to be another girl in your parade of girls"" (cheesy line) and then the next minute he grabs her and kisses her and POOF her attitude is gone. Not to mention how quickly the guy got over it when he was telling Ronnie his sob story. In addition, the attempt of humor with her father's remark about his creepy smile was weak. I thought this would be a lot better."
3,I would watch this more than once.,Nice story and great images. The actors all did a good job with what they were given. Sit back and just enjoy this one. Do not over analyze anything and enjoy this with some popcorn.
5,The last song,"This was a good movie.Good comuniation, and fast dellivery.This sight wants way to many words for a review"
3,Great movie!,"This is my second or third time watching this movie. I purchased DVD after seeing it in the theater's. Im sure will watch it many more times. Story line is a reallty good one. Written by Nicholas Sparks. Gifted girl going through a rough patch after parents divorce. Gives up playing music. Goes to visit father in another state, meets boy going through some troubled times as well. Fall in love with boy. Falls back in love with music. Faces some discriminiation. Repairs broken relationship with father. A bit of tears as usual in Sparks movies, but the story is poignant and touching. Definately would recommend this movie."
5,Tearjerker,One of my favorite movies of all time. I have every one hooked on it since I love it so much :) it's become a cult classic for me! And who just doesn't love the dreamy liam hemsworth? ;)
4,Mother/Daughter moment,"My daughter and I are suckers for a love story. This movie provides several levels: the realistic love of bad girl Ronnie and rich, but troubled Will, the love/hate relationship of Ronnie and her Dad, even the love of her brother, and mother. We enjoy the supporting cast including brother Jonah, and father Steve (played by Bobby Coleman and Greg Kinnear). The only parts that don't fly are the beach volleyball. Who would even care? Our three favorite scenes? When she plays the piano for Will, when she appears at the wedding in her fun but believable gown, and when the turtles hatch. Is it the best movie ever? No, it's a warm cup of cocoa on a wintry night, or a cozy blanket when you're wanting a little cuddle time with your favorite girl."
2,Not good....It made me want to gag,This movie might be good for teens who are too immature to realize that this movie is full of predictable plots and characters. It was sappy and lacked depth. I rolled my eyes throughout most of it. If you like Miley Cyrus than this might be OK but if you are looking for a deep and moving movie.....look elsewhere.
2,....yawns....,"I found it boring, predictable and I have to be honest: I'm writing this review even though I didn't watch the end; I simply lost interest halfway through the movie and switched to Warner Channel.I liked Greg Kinnear's performance (Ronnie's father) but I absolutely hated Miley Cyrus as Ronnie. I'm aware that according to the plot Ronnie has to be a bitch at the beginning, but Miley Cyrus just ruined it for me. What's up with her teeth anyways!That said, I already read what the ending is about, the plot is not that bad, I wonder if the book is any good, I simply regret watching the movie (well, half of it)"
3,NOT like the book AT ALL!,"I was very disappointed with this movie, not because of Miley Cyrus' acting (surprisingly), but because it was SO DIFFERENT from the book! Cyrus' acting was actually good! A lot better than I thought it would be. I am only disappointed with this movie because it left out all of the important parts of the book! If you read the book before watching the movie, you will have the same opinion as I do. While the book left me crying, the movie left me mad. I suggest reading the book and NOT WATCHING the movie."
2,Sappy.,"The Last Song is just a sappy and a depressing film from beginning to end. Greg Kinnear is the standout performance in this film, he is a great and a solid actor but I can't say the same for teen star Miley Cyrus! Cyrus has absolutely no range or depth to take on such a serious role. The way she says her lines are completely lifeless and monotone. She puts no effort or feeling into her screen time, she brings nothing magical to The Last Song so bascially what I'm trying to say is...she ruined this drama for me!"
5,Love it!,I love this moive a lot!!!!! I love this moive a lot!!!!! I love this moive a lot!!!!! I love this moive a lot!!!
5,Great Movie,I read all of Nicholas Sparks books. This movie is true to the book and is very well acted by Miley Cyrus as well as the rest of the cast. Be prepared and have a box of Kleenex by your side though. It is a beautiful story.
3,lLast Song,"The movie dvd was in excellent shape,but the movie itself was a little corny, but I beleive that all good movies have already been recorded and new movie cannot find a different and interesting story. I'm sure if I haven't seen as many movies as I have, this one would of rated better,"
5,Fantastic Movie!!!,"This movie was great, Miley is a rising star so give here a break its her first movie. Movie's are diffrent then Hannah Montana. Me and my family love the movie and watched 10 times. The book was great just like the movie. This is a unquie movie so go buy it!!!"
1,worst movie ever,"The Last Song is in a league of its own. It is by far and away the worst movie I have ever seen in my life. Miley Cirus is legitimately hard to look at with her veneers. Her face looks like she is smelling poop for the entire movie! I used to think she was a pretty good actress on ""Hannah Montana"" but now I literally dislike everything she has ever produced simply because of this movie. Please, please, please don't waste your time or your money on this movie."
5,Great chick flick,just over all good movie. I would love now to read the book because I heard the book is even better than the movie. You won't be disappointed with this movie.
5,Great,"I picked this movie because I saw it on tv and didn't get to watch all of it. I would recommend this to anyone. I didn't like that it had no boppers or extra scenes, other than that it was good."
4,Cute!,"This movie was really cute with teenie bopper romance but also touching. I would recommend if you like romance & drama. If I told you any more, I would be giving away the movie."
3,The book is better than the movie.,The book was quite a bit better than the movie. The movie left out parts that made this book my favorite Nicholas Sparks book so far. I probably would have enjoyed the movie more if I did not know how much was missing.
5,Movie,"This is a great movie for the family to watch. A little sad in the end,. but it has a great story line behind it. Would say this is a movie the whole family can watch together on family night."
1,WHV DVD release of 13 May 2008,"If you're thinking about improving your previous DVD edition of this great movie (WHV release of 2 May 2000), still available on Amazon, don't bother. It's identical, just repackaged...(FIVE stars for the movie itself!)"
4,"Great music, great dancing, great stars, what else would you want?","On shore leave from the Navy in New York, our stars find love, adventure and mischief. Lots of music and laughs. Excellent entertainment."
5,Howard says!,"Splendid first class entertainment from magical starsrepresenting Hollywoods golden years, which transformsyou in time to a make believe world. We will never seetheir like again."
3,Quality Alert!,"This is a fun little movie which I find compelling whenever Gene Kelly and Vera Ellen are on the screen. Otherwise it is somewhat corny to be honest. However, I bought this from Amazon and it turned out to be defective with digital breakup which stalled my player. I returned it then purchased it from our local Tower Video store only to find something similar. When returning it, the manager and I noticed indentations in the stock itself, perhaps indicative of a bad printing which, if this is the case, it would be nice to see Warner Brothers do something about it. If this was an anomaly I would like to know about it as there is something simple and nice, evocative of a past era which I would enjoy having in my collection."
5,On The Town 1949,"New York , New York , its a wonderful town -especially when sailors Gene Kelly (1912-1996) , Frank Sinatra (1915-1998) , Jules Munshin (1915-1970) have a 24-hour shore leave to see sighs..and when those sights include Ann Miller (1923-2004) , Betty Garrett (1919- ) , and Vera-Ellen (1921-1981) . Co-directed by Gene Kelly and Stanley Donen (1924- ) , based on the broadway hit . On the town changes the landscape of movie musicals , opening filmaker?s eyes to what could be done on location and when brilliant location and Studio production numbers are blended , it could be -as here -embulient , up-and-at-?m perfection . The Bronx is up and the batterys down , butno one can be down after going on the town . Super,Super Musical , your see a wonderful performance and how N.Y looks in 1949 and buildings and people have gone long time ago , it?s a time capsule for nostalgic tours . Transfer in Ultra-Resolution Quality picture . Recommended"
5,A turning point for MGM,"'On the Town' was the best example in 1949 that MGM's Freed Unit had ever produced of the 'integrated musical'. Song, dance and plot are woven tightly together in a way that seems more natural than ever before.When 'On the Town' premiered, the line went all the way around the block at Radio City Music Hall. It was an outstanding success.I think for this movie you do need a particular sense of humor. The number 'Prehistoric Man' in particular can lead certain fans of other musicals to bewilderment with its sillyness... however, it's all good fun and all in the name of 'entertainment'. *gulps*.The movie is light hearted, eye catching (the first one shot on location in New York City) and fast paced. Any fans of Kelly and Sinatra need to see it, as well as fans of the musical comedy. If you want an example of one of the highest productions of MGM's Freed Unit (after which inspirations came for 'An American in Paris', 'Singin' in the Rain' and 'The Band Wagon'), this is it!"
5,Gene Kelly Genius!,"This movie is great! It features a wonderfully talented cast that includes Gene Kelly and Frank Sinatra. The plot is a bit weak in parts, but the song and dance numbers are great!"
5,It's the Best,On The Town is the best movie I've seen in my whole lifetime. I find it enjoyable for the family and musical lovers. You can watch it over and over again. It's funny and the best songs ever (I can't get them out of my head!). It was a wonderful production.
4,Wow! What a movie!,"I actually haven't seen the whole thing, but I couldn't stop myself from writing a review! I've looked for it everywhere, but I can't find it! From what I saw of it, I know it is a wonderful movie. The ""New York, New York"" sequence at the start really gets you into it! I loved it, it's definitely one of a kind. I reccomened to everyone who likes Gene Kelly and Frank Sinatra, who are both great in this movie. Of course it's hard to forget Vera Ellen, who is very talented and beautiful in this movie. I wish someday to see the rest of it, and I am going to keep looking for it everywhere. Watch it now!"
4,Puck of Pook's Hill,"I enjoyed this book and liked the fantasy and escapism of it all, I had read it before, and remembered a lot of what happened in it, enjoyed it more the second time around"
4,A view of history,"This is an interesting view of history, seen from the point of view of an immortal. It is a good picture both of the old times it tells us of and the time in which the book was written."
3,"Read it anyway, but don't give it to the kids without a warning.","Most of this book is worth reading as fantasy fiction, and all of it is worth studying as an example of late Victorian attitudes. Kipling didn't handle the transitions between ""fantasy"" and ""reality"" as well as modern writers who specialize in this sort of thing, but he did pretty well. However ... every time I read this to enjoy the adventures of Dan and Una, I trip up on the character of the medieval Jew who has an inborn, racial ""talent for gold."" While I don't usually think books should be updated or abridged for modern readers, I would consider excising just a few sentences of this one before letting a child read it.I recall the comments of a Chinese-American reader who discovered that the beloved Louisa May Alcott used some demeaning stereotypes of Chinese people: Suddenly, one is cast out of the category of ""reader"" into the category of ""other,"" and one never quite comes back."
3,intricate visual composition,"This is Kipling ""tripling"" through British historyand concocting a visually elaborate fantasy forthe imaginatiion. Lovers of psychedelia and thelike will feel at home in this meandering trip oftwo children through English history.The idea is a good one, yet somehow thismidsummer tale inspired by the appearance ofPuck in the children's fairy ring gets tedious.We start off feeling like we're falling down therabbit hole once again with Alice, yet this time wenever land anywhere. We just keep falling andwaiting for this book to end.This book is interesting as far as it goes, but itjust goes on......and on..........and on.<BR"
1,DON'T BUY IT !!!!!!!,"DONT BUY THIS PIECE OF ""POOP"" Like others says this thing dosen't fit on the car they specified and theres no way to make it fit.Trust me I'm been a system installer for more that 10 years now and I have never seen a soooooooo useless piece of plastic on my life, and even WORSE!!! Amazon is backing up this thing!.It seems like it's just a black plastic frame that you install on top of your preinstalled estero and it just to cover some openings around it, It dosen't have any means to hold or secure your stero so the stereo has to be bolted or secured by other means to your car's dashboard.Ohhh and I almost forgot! .... it also have a very thin pocket under of the unit, and it's made of cheap plastic.SincerelyA very desapointed Amazon customer."
5,Works Fine,Put this in a 2000 cougar and i must say for the price there is nothing wrong with it. I can see where people think you have to do cutting and stuff to get it in but really the stereo gets put in first and then the face goes over it. For the Money i don't see anything wrong with this product other than the mounting bracket in the back could be made out of metal or made a bit more sturdy somehow. Fits perfectly otherwise
1,Does not Fit under any circumstances!,"I saw the other reviews saying it wouldn't fit, but I couldn't find a product on Amazon that was rated any high for my Focus so I gave this a shot. It doesn't fit. No DIN radio will ever fit with this unit. Even if you were to cut the hole big enough (which was my plan) the unit is not shaped properly to accept the cage that goes around every DIN radio. It looks to me as if this is made to cover a radio that is already install into some other bracket, but no such bracket exists.Just in case anyone missed it, IT DOESN""T FIT! IT WILL NEVER WORK FOR ANY DIN RADIO! NO NOT BUY!"
2,pretty empty,"I found this book rather flat and uninteresting as to both characters and events. When I finished reading, I felt like I did not really read anything, that I can't even describe what the book is about. An average book of nowadays."
3,dry in the middle,"the book started out pretty good and the ending was sweet but in the middle, it dragged on too long. the book is Ok."
4,Loved it,"Great book! I could hardly put this one down, and whenever I did put it down I was constantly wondering about Adrian and Bill! To this date I have not given any of her books five stars, except Jewels. I guess I'm waiting for one of her books to beat out that one! Seems impossible!"
2,Not My Favorite,"Overall I guess this was a good book, but compared to the other Danielle Steel books I have read, Lightning and Mixed Blessings, it doesnt measure up. I liked those far more. For the first 200 pages I didnt think anything really happened and I had to fight to keep reading. I also kept expecting Adrian to get back together with Steven since the character in Lightning reunited as did Diana in Mixed Blessings. I would have liked to hear more about Bill and Adrians life after the birth of the baby as opposed to all of the tedious events that led to them meeting. As mentioned before, I did like it and 2 stars is deceiving. It was a great book, but not near as great as what Steel is capable of."
4,why do some people say it was bad?,"ok, i admit, this isn't the best book ever written, but so what? have any of you ever tried to write and publish a book. i thought that this was a pretty good book and people who are not critical about absolutely everything they see and read should try it out. i'm only 12 and i did!"
2,Bad Game,"This is one of the worst games that I have played this year. I read all the previews, saw the pretty pictures, and got interested. Unfortunately, the final product is such a disappointment. I am so sick of switches or ""puzzles"" as you run around and jump around to look for the next exit point. I also don't want to spend my time leaping from one platform to another. Where's the fun? This is not the Olympics. In a word, lame. And the perspective makes it that more difficult. A 3D game should not have platform jumping as a major gameplay feature. In addition, the game AI is weak and unchallenging. There are instances wherein the enemy just ""sits"" there and you hack away, without any effort or fun. There's a online multiplayer portion to the game but I didn't purchase the game for that reason. Anyhow, as strictly a single-player experience, I'm giving the game a generous 2 out of 5."
2,Attack of the killer crabs.....,"...should have been the title. Which is a shame, because the opening sequences were well done and promised a good, solid FPS/3PS with a unique feel, and it performed well and looked very good on my computer. I especially enjoyed the underwater sequences with floating bodies, a sunken ship, and nasty looking fish, but the game soon deteriorated into endless hacking and chopping of an army of large crab-like beasts through never-ending caverns, all the while on my knees. Combine this with a monosyllabic ""hero""....no, wait. ""Monosyllabic"" implies some form of speech or communication. This Neanderthal doesn't even grunt. Conan the Barbarian is a poet compared to this guy and I'm supposed to care whether he lives or dies? Either way, I didn't make it through the first level before I returned the game. Perhaps you will have more patience than I."
1,BORING,"This game could have been so much more. The hack and slash action is not even fun, it just get's tedious and boring. I have to admit the graphic's are spectacular, but that does not make this a great game. Rune contains lot's of jumping from object to object, which will get boring after they first introduce it into the game. The game also had no depth whatsoever. I never just want to play it for fun, because I felt there almost is no fun in this game. In my opinion, if you are going to get a hack and slash action game GET BLADE OF DARKNESS."
3,Not a bad use of one's gaming time.,"Rune has a lot of good points: The story, the visuals and the hacking and slashing. However, I must point out that the amount ""switch-hunting"" and ""key searching"" in this game is a bit too much.Anyway, are'nt game developers getting tired of that old plot device? You spend a great deal of time in this game getting lost while hunting for a switch, which made me very sleepy. Why not move the story along using something else that is more fitting to the game?For example, put the key to the locked door on a chain around a monster's neck. If a switch must be used to raise a gate, don't hide it so it takes all night to find it! Put the darned thing in plain sight surrounded by a bunch of Ogres or trolls or whatever monster is appropriate. See? Now the game is more fun already..."
2,Rune-a disappoinment,"I read a couple of decent reviews of this before I bought it(Games Domain.com) and as I'm into a bit of action and adventure and thought Severance to be superb, I shelled out my cash for Rune.Rune has a great story line running through it. Thats about the best thing in the game. if you liked Tomb raider, then this is Tomb Raider with Vikings (with few challenging puzzles)!! Lots of ledge jumping and climbing, swimming and swinging from vines and stuff- very disappointing.The enemies did nothing for me and the combat system is basic to say the least.The graphics are good (so they should using the Unreal Tournament engine)but even so at some angles Ragnor becomes transparent.All in all don't waste your money on this unless Tomb Raider style jumping is your thing. If you're over 18 buy Severance because its ace!!You might also try Heavy Metal Faxx 2. The heroine is a babe, the action is good and the enemies are cool.F.A.B. guys"
5,Statistics Rule!!!!,Kline has a great grasp on Structural Equation modeling and this book was very helpful. I cannot imagine taking Structural Equation Modeling without this book.
4,This Book is GREAT!,This Book is Great for anyone doing analysis using SEM. It is a very good source of refference. Its clear and concise.
1,Dies after short use,"I bought this camera as a graduation gift, so I wasn't able to test it during Gateway's 15 day full refund policy. As soon as it was used, it said the battery was low on brand new batteries. The representative at Gateway said they could replace the product (which took 3 months). The replacement did the exact same thing as the original, so I called Gateway again. This time, after talking to a supervisor, I was offered an upgrade to the Gateway M42. I have not gotten this yet, but I am waiting to see if this camera has the same issue."
1,Camera turns off by itself/ Gateway has poor customer servic,Our camera turns off in mid use. We had it for 20 days and Gaetway would not replace. I went to the GAteway store and tehy siad they had a lot of probelms with this camera. They would fix it if I paid the cost of shipping. I have learned my lesson never to shop at Gateway.
1,Allergic to Acai Berry!,"I have never had an allergic reaction to anything I have ingested in my life until Acai berry juice - and two weeks after stopping my itchy hives haven't quit...I checked the web and others are also having this reaction, so beware!"
4,God-send of a book,"This book was extremely helpful to me. As a future church planter I found David Garrison's assessments very helpful and encouraging. I was particularly impacted by his section on The Muslim World. My family and I have been called to church plant Among Muslim people coming to the United States. This book was of a great help to me in giving me guidance on what a good church plant looks like and how to begin that process, weighing the successes and failures of others. I found the appendix on the Qur'anic Bridge helpful because it presents the gospel in a contexualized way! I look forward to using this resource on the field and I know that God placed this book in my hands purposefully at the right time! I applaud Garrison for the effort and detail he provided on so many regions. It was uplifting to see how God is redeeming a lost world in so many regions!"
5,"""splatter breaks""","this is the kind of electronic music you can mosh to. it is like terrorcore/idm. dj scud is a genius along with his label ambush and everyone one it(mostly). this album has lots of breaks d&b and reggae influences in it, but they are combined to make a new unique sound not heard before."
3,ouch,"this is the musical equivalent to needles in the ears. don't get me wrong i liked this cd and wanted to blast it while driving but scud and rich kid's songs specialize in shrill resonating shreiks that feel like they will pierce your ear drum . so although i want to listen to this album loud i can't because it's just too painful. as far as dirty, nasty, distorted, gobbled up and spat out ragga goes... this is it. it's like those really crazy moments at a Drop Bass party."
1,Ordered here.. received with Walgreens 2/$5 sale sticker!!!!,"I ordered the animated Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde movie from Amazon.com for $9.95 and got it today..... Only it had a bright green Walgreens sale sticker that says 2/$5 !!!!!! WTF?!!Hmmmmmm.............. AWESOME. Called customer service, and ""the best they could do"" was issue a refund of $5.95 (which isn't as good as Walgreens offers, but oh well. LOL But I thought I would let you guys know... so take from it what you want;) LOLOtherwise, its a good movie and I would rate it higher.. but I wanted to have a low score to bring attention to others about my experience;)"
1,"while the item seems high quality, it fails early.","This cable had all of the high end features one would want, braided cable, gold plated contacts, and so forth. And, well, the thing failed within a couple months. Now I replaced it with the cheapest piece of junk that Amazon carries and that lasted way longer, and it provided a better quality (or as good) picture.I would not spend my money on these overpriced, underperforming cables. Sorry.The items are only warrantied if they are purchased from a licensed dealer. Unless you are sure that this reseller is such a dealer, I wouldn't risk it. And I would save my receipt."
1,BROKE OFF IN TV,"We smoothly plugged this cable in with no trouble, gave it plenty of bend radius, had a great connection. We went to remove, and the sheathing stayed in the TV pins and cable came out. It destroyed our HDMI port, and now our Plasma can only connect via component (pointless for that new blu-ray player). Do NOT buy this product!"
1,Piece of junk.,The tip broke off this over priced piece of junk. I now avoid anything with the Rocketfish name printed on it.
4,Another Callahan classic!,"A great story and action that really keeps your attention. Harry meets up against a crooked police chief (portrayed to a T by Hal Holbrook) and some young, slick crooked renegade rookie cops (David Soul, Kip Niven, Robert Urick and Tim Matheson). The last half hour is very intense featuring a chase, a search-and-kill on a merchant ship and the final blow-out on the dock. One-by-one the cops get their due justice-Harry style!"
4,Make your day by watching this flick.,"Not a bad way to spend an hour and forty minutes. It's definetley a hard to swallow premise, but hey that's what movies are for. With violence and humor, this movie excels at both. It's got some great scenes and Eastwood is great. Great finale."
4,A PRETTY GOOD FLICK,"I'd say this film is well worth 10 bucks. The storyline is good and the action sequences are fun to watch. Also, the scene with Eastwood pretending to be a pilot was classic. Hal Holbrook does a good job of.......well, watch the movie and find out."
4,A much better film than given credit for,Clint Eastwood still at his iconic best and some great talents involved front and behind camera. Much closer to the classic first film than the diminishing returns of the rest of the series when Harry disappointingly changed from almost super hero to just another cop. Other fans may not agree but for this reviewer the first two movies are the cream of the crop!!
4,What Happened to Harry Guardino?,"""Magnum Force"" is a good sequel to ""Dirty Harry"" but doesn't achieve the iconic status of that film. It's quite ambitious to tackle the issue of vigilanteism particularly when it deals with rogue police officers but I don't think the film explored it deep enough. This is quite surprising because the script is by John Milius and Michael Cimino two of filmdoms more interesting scribes. There's a lot of good action but there are moments of tedium particularly towards the end. What I did like about the film is they did flesh out Harry's character giving him more of a back story plus a home and love life. A worthy sequel that doesn't reach the original's greatness."
4,"TED POST, OPUS 6","**** 1973. Written by John Milius and Michael Cimino and directed by Ted Post. Very interesting follow-up of the Inspector Harry saga. Suspected to have (too) far right ideas inDirty Harry, our hero has got now an Afro-American partner, sleeps with an Asian-American girl and fights bad cops. Apart of these considerations, MAGNUM FORCE is an excellent thriller of the beginning of the 70's I use to review every five years or so."
3,Magnum Force (1973),"Seldom sequels seem to live up to the original, but this an exception. Eastwood returns as Dirty Harry Callahan, the tough San Francisco cop. He take on a group of vigilante cops who are cold-blooded killers. Excellent sequel, worthy to watch. I watched it at least 15 times!"
2,THIS SERIOUSLY LACKS THE WIT AND THE PUNCH OF THE FIRST; 2.5,"IN THE FIRST SEQUEL TO THE CLASSIC ''DIRTY HARRY'', HARRY CALLAHAN [CLINT EASTWOOD] RETURNS TO TAKE ON A LEAGUE OF VIGILANTE COPS WHO'RE KILLING OFF THE CITY'S CRIMINALS. THE IDEA WAS GOOD, BUT IT WASN'T EXECUTED GOOD. HAS SOME DECENT ACTION, BUT IT'S SERIOUSLY NOWHERE NEAR THE FIRST MOVIE'S LEVEL. EASTWOOD IS FUN AS ALWAYS, BUT THIS MOVIE NEEDS SOME WORK. EVEN THOUGH A LOT OF PEOPLE ON THIS WEBSITE SEEM TO DISAGREE WITH ME, I THINK THE FANS OF THE ORIGINAL WILL NOT ENJOY THIS ONE TOO MUCH. DON'T GET ME WRONG, THIS AIN'T AS BAD AS IT COULD BE, BUT IT AIN'T NO CLASSIC LIKE THE ORIGINAL! JUST AN AVERAGE SEQUEL. FOLLOWED BY THE ENFORCER."
4,Good stuff!,"The Dirty Harry series is a FIVE STAR experience. This film is a four star product, however, and for a very sensible reason: It isn't as great as some of the other chapters, like SUDDEN IMPACT. If you are a Dirty Harry fan you will like it though! Count on it!"
4,First Sequel A Good One,"The first sequel to ""Dirty Harry,"" is an involving story that grabs you right from the start and keeps you interested for the full two hours.In this one, ""Harry"" (Clint Eastwood) goes up against cops-turned-vigilantes. It's interesting to see two of those young policemen who went on to stardom on TV: David Soul and Robert Urich. However, I don't recall Urich uttering one line! Hal Holbrook, meanwhile, was convincing as the bad guy-lieutenant.The climactic scene was a little hokey: all kinds of car chases and shootouts in the streets but no one else around! Where was everyone? Have you ever noticed how many times that happens in movies? All kinds of strange and loud things happen on the road but at that particular time - even in the middle of the day - no one else is on the road. Oh well.Frankly, I found all the 'Dirty Harry' movies entertaining."
4,HARRY MEETS HUTCH,"The se ond entry in the Dirty Harry series finds Clint Eastwood up against a vigilante force of cops out to rid the world of nasty criminals who have escaped the justice system. What is unique about this particular entry is the casting of several up and coming actors who would go on to their own starring roles in years to come: David Soul, Robert Urich and Tim Matheson for starters. They are some of the rookie motorcycle cops involved in the force. Hal Holbrook is an appropriately smarmy boss for Harry and Harry staple Albert Popwell is back as a particularly nasty pimp with a penchant for Drano. Even with all its implausibilities, MAGNUM FORCE is a worthy entry in the Harry series and should please fans of vigilante justice as well."
4,"The Best of the ""Dirty Harry"" Sequels","Clint Eastwood's ""Dirty Harry"" was a tough act to follow, yet ""Magnum Force"" (1973) holds up quite well. Though the guiding hand of director Don Siegel is sorely missed, Eastwood and Company still deliver the goods. This time around, Inspector Harry Callahan investigates a series of murders committed by a self-appointed death squad within the San Francisco police department. The film offers plenty of 44-caliber action and some classic Clint one-liners (""A man's got to know his limitations""). As Callahan's boss, Hal Holbrook is a memorable Eastwood adversary. ""Magnum Force"" would make a terrific double bill with the original ""Dirty Harry."""
5,Best of Eastwood,I like Clint Eastwood movies & this is definitely one of his best. He has done an awesome job in the movie. Rough & tough as always.
5,An excellent musical story for youngsters.,"Parents will find Queen, The Bear & The Bumblebee to be an excellent musical story for youngsters: it tells of three friends who realize that wishes can lead to adventures and self-discovery. The story was originally written and performed as a poem to entertain sick children but here blends classical orchestra and songs to bring lively listening to ages 4 and older."
2,Noise reduction-purchased thru Amazon.,"Perhaps I was mislead by the claim of noise canceling. The only noise ""reduction of any degree is when used with audio""."
4,"Hey, this crazy gizmo really works!","Well, to a good extent anyway. The sound quality is not great, but what would you expect from such a cheap product. And I don't use them on airplanes, but to listen to as I go to sleep. The noise cancellation does work, though it does make its own hum as well. It works well enough to cancel out the fans I usually have running while I sleep, though, which is good enough for me!The only drawback to them I can see is the lack of padding on top, where is rubs against your head. It doesn't bother me usually, since I am laying down, but I think it would be a problem on a long flight, as it did become uncomfortable when I used them with my laptop for a while."
3,"Nice headset for the price, not great at cancelling noise","I got these at a nice discount on Amazon. However, I only use them in the gym. They do not cancel noise that well on the plane. You still hear quite a bit of engine noise when the noise reduction switch is turned on and the batteries only lasted for about 4 hours. I usually must turn the volume on the mp3 player I use at the maximum setting. Great stereo sound quality, however."
2,Nothing special,I have no idea if noise reduction really works but it doesn't do much with this pair of headphones.
2,"Poor results, flimsy cord","These headphones are lightweight and comfortable, and the cord is long enough, and they came with an airplane adapter included. These are the good things I can say.Unfortunately, the bad outweighs the good.The cord is very thin and flimsy, and I'm afraid it would not last very long. I bought these at a store and they are going back. The noise cancellation does not work well. When you turn it on, a hissing noise starts, and the outside noise is not perceptibly diminished. In addition to normal household noise, I tested them with a violin playing in the same room, and they failed that test spectacularly."
1,not good,"I didn't notice a difference between puting them on and putting my hands over my ears.Want one for cutting out/down the background noise of the TV so I can concentrate on reading. Don't want to listen to music, want to hear nothing/little so I can concentrate on what I'm doing, so I never tried listening to music through them.Returned them."
2,Mediocre at best (while it lasted),"Do yourself a favor and don't waste your time or money on these. I've had these for a little over a year now and they do no function. One ear piece crackles and the other doesn't even have sound. Mind you, this is a replacement pair. I had the same issue the first time around and was dumb enough to exchange them (thinking it was just a faulty pair). So it seems like these headphones short a lot, and the noise cancellation was just a big joke. The only good quality was that they were comfortable to wear and were fold-able. I guess you get what you pay for."
2,Decent headphones - No noice cancellation,"I use these at work and they work well as headphones but very poorly as ""noise cancelling"" headphones. That being said, I have tried on many expensive ""noise cancelling"" headphones and have found all of them to be poor at cancelling out noise. As such, these are basically as good as any more expensive brand you can pick up. Any noise cancelling headphones requiring a battery, I am dubious about. If you want true noise cancellation, look for a pair of headphones that fit completely over and around the ear."
3,noise cancelling function doesn't work,"Bought headphones used but in excellent condition from flea market. Noise cancelling feature is non-existent. However, the sound quality is good. THe bass is just right and the other sound aspects is in good proportion.You won't damage your ears. This is the first noise cancelling headphones i evered listened to. Maybe other noise cancelling headphones are the same? Best thing about this product is it light weight, folds, and ear cups are comfortable. THe cord is just the right length, not too long for ipod use. Overall, Worth only $15 or less."
3,Bashing the Bourgeoisie,"This is my first Monroe book, so I have to be open-minded. I don't mind that the main character was unlikable. I don't mind that her friends and co-workers were the kind of people I tend to avoid. I do mind when authors bash the ""African American Bourgeoisie"". Charles Dickens is the master of the ""noble poor"" theme. With Monroe, I never felt that her character was noble, just an angry, bitter, self obsessed woman. Ann was her alter ego in the story. Ann, an African American woman with a college degree and could speak several languages. ..was evil? The message I got from this book was ""you better stay away from college..young black women of America..it can mess you up, it can mess up your kids too."" I guess I am not a fan of that brand of thinking. Success is not synonymous with selling out."
3,Yeah it could have been better!,This was an ok book I expected it to be a lot better! But thats cool cause I am still a fan of Mary Monroe!
4,Good,This was a good book. Some of the situations and scenarios that came about were far fetched but still entertaining. If you are a Mary Monroe fan you'll enjoy the book.
2,Time Waster,"Although the reality is that this could happen.... this was a boring book. Trudy jeopardize her job, relationships, and her freedom just to buy some clothes and lobster dinners. I read the book just to get through it but was very disappointed in it in the end. I would have expected more drama or even a serious consequence for this behavior. NOTHING. I expected more from Ms. Monroe because I have been pleased in the past. However, this book is something I would recommend to readers that do not enjoy drama, suspense, or action."
3,WHO IS TRUDY BELL? CAN SHE BE ANN OLIVER,"MEET TRUDY BELL WHO HAS SO MANY MYSTERYS ABOUT HERSELF,THAT SHE CAN'T TRULY UNDERSTAND HER ACTIONS.WHEN TRUDY IS ROB AND ASSAULT IN HER DAD LIQUOR STORE SHE WANTS OUT,SHE HAS HAD IT.SHE LEAVE THERE AND GET HIRE AT BON VOYAGE AND UPSCALE TRAVEL AGENT. THERE SHE MEETS A WOMAN THAT WILL CHANGE HER LIFE FOREVER. A WOMAN THAT TRUDY,HATES AND LOVE,AND ALMOST DIE FOR.THIS WOMAN IS TROUBLE JUST LIKE TRUDY.WHEN YOU MEET THE REAL ANN OLIVER YOU WILL KNOW,WHO SHE IS AND HOW IS WORKS.WILL THE REAL ANN OLIVER PLEASE STAND UP. THIS IS A PAGE TURNER YOU DON'T KNOW WHATS COMING NEXT."
3,it was just okay,"I have enjoyed all Monroe's book however; this novel was a bite of a snoozer. The main character stole her supervisor's identity and basically lived it up; taking trips to Vegas and Mexico, going on shopping sprees, expensive restaurants, etc. She did get found. I wont spoil it for you if you plan on reading it by telling you by whom and under what circumstance.With the previous novels I didn't want to put them down to see what was gonna happen next....this novel, I had to force myself to finish reading it. It was good but not as good as the others (Lay My Burdens Down, God don't like ugly, and The Upper Room)."
3,ok,LIKE ALL OF HER BOOKS IT WAS A SLOW READ BUT A GOOD STORY LINE. I JUST THINK IT COULD OF BEEN A LITTLE MORE FAST PACED.
3,WELL WRITTEN (3 stars and a half),"Monroe is without a doubt a very talented and entertaining writer,however towards the end of the book there was a dead ,boring point..What I found intersting is the fact she had te gut and originality to write about something different than relationships drama.I finished this book in 10 hours.it was a good read.predictable yet surprising at the end.I enjoyed."
3,Not what I expected...,"Interesting but slow, for the first time I am disappointed in Monroe. I have always said that Mary Monroe was my favorite female author (I would say author in general but I love Eric Jerome Dickey) but this one was not her best. I looking for it to be intense like ""The Upper Room"" or ""Gonna Lay Down My Burdens"" but it wasn't. It did nothing for me I forced myself to finish. If you are a true Monroe fan than you'll understand my disappointment in her."
1,Don't Do It,"I was so disappointed in this book! It's a very slow read and you spend most of your reading awaiting something to occur. I have been bored for the majority of the book. I am a reader who attempts to finish what I start. I have been reading this book since December 23, 2006. It is now, March 2007. If you purchase this book, buy it used. Better yet, you can have mine!"
3,Slow start,"It started very slow for me, but improved as I continued to read. I would recommend it to a friend."
1,first time ive read a book by mary monroe and it will be my last,"This book was so slow. The Arthur just kept on repeating her self over and over again. I cant stand when a writer does that. Its like she was just trying to fill in the pages by repeatinrg. Ive read other reviews and they say that Mary Monroe is a great writer,but it doesn't show in this book. This arthur made me so made that I will never read any more of her books."
3,Watch Out For The Wolf...,"This book was right on time. We often perceive identity thieves to be computer geeks or crackers (HACKERS are not malicious)sitting at their desks breaking all kinds of computer security codes and language and taking advantage of innocent people. This books shows that that is not always the case. Very often it is someone who simply has the time, the access and most of all, the opportunity.The character here is the best example of all those characteristics. She was needy in more ways than one and Ms. Monroe humanized the heinous act of stealing someone's life from them. Apparently after being a victim, she could write about it better than most. Good for her! Good story. Good writing."
3,Blind to the consequenses,"I think this book was crazy. Trudy was doing some straight up federal s***. She didn't even think of the consequences. She was so caught up with living the lavish lifestyle of her boss Anne Oliver, that she never thought for one minute that she would loose her fiance and even her self-esteem. But at least home girl lived it up before she got too old. And to think, she didn't even get any jail time. This book was good, but it wasn't all that. I would suggest that all you credit card, and check forgers out there, think twice before being greedy.Cream."
2,Not One of Her Best,This is a long and boring book was about identity theft. The book was very predictable. I'm a fan of Mary's Monroe's books. I was very disappointed in this book.
4,Always a fan of Mary Monroe!!,"I love her books! This was another great book. Following Trudy's transition, drama, ups and downs was geat. Every reader out there should read evey single one of her books, she is truly talented and there aren't any other author's out there that write just like her! i will continue to be her fan!"
3,Days Of Reckoning,"Wow. This album is strong. Just by listening to the first 3 songs, you can tell this is one of the more creative metal/hardcore bands out there today. Another observation is...this music would kill live. I've never gotten a chance to see diecast but Im sure they put on a helluva show. More of the creativness on this album comes from not the melodies, but the rythems. Its full of the kind that force you to move your head. Diecast in definetly a winner for Chimaira fans. The standout musician here is definetly the drummer. His feet fly. The two things I didn't like about this album was the production (im usually not a stickler for this but it was mixed bad, no bass, and one guitar usually completly drowns out the other) and when the entire band yells in a chanting kind of fashion. Ugh. It sounds too Anthraxy for me.Best Songs: Disrepair and Remember the FallenOne Word Review: Powerful"
5,MAGNIFICIENT HARDCORE,"This cd shows you what metalcore is really about, and you can't go wrong with heavy riffs, brutal drumming, and intense singing. Colin and the guys have just only started their reign of terror to hardcore kids in the US. It won't be long till these guys start playin sold out venues and tours in which no one in their right mind would miss.DIECAST IS QUALITY METAL/HARDCORE AND I RECOMMEND 100% THAT YOU BUY THIS ALBUM RIGHT NOW!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Not a sequel,"I read ""Miles To Go Before I Sleep: My Grateful Journey Back from the Hijacking of..."" and I assumed ""A Survivor's Story..."" would be the sequel. It is actually the same book with a new title and cover.The story is very inspirational. I would love to see a sequel about where Jackie is today."
2,Works Great Till it Breaks,"I had one for 6 months and was quite happy. Then the cryptic error message came on and it wouldn't work. So took it back to Costco and got another. It worked great for 10 days, and then had the same cryptic message. This is non-repairable by the user. So you have to send it to Sharp for repair -- best not to buy it at all. I returned it and got a Brother 8640D - The brother actually is much faster for scanning, copying and printing. Hope it lasts.Updated February 2009: After three years the Brother is still going strong. Definitely go for the Brother."
3,Sharp support is terrible,"I received the printer and have an error when installing. it does not recognize the unit as a 2.0 usb. I tried it on a new Dell a new HP and a year old HP laptop. I have been on the phone 4 times with Sharp support. They answered fast, all were americans speaking clear english. They sent the problem to development but said that since I can get it to print from some applications they say they dont guarantee it for all software applications. They confirmed that the install is not completing and the printer is not recognized in my hardware config. I had our IT person look at it and he agrees it is the printer. I talked to a local retailer and they confirmed that Sharp support is lacking. Sharp said if the replaced it, that it would be with a refurbished one. They suggested I return it to where I purchased it. I did not want the hassle of getting one shipped from amazon and shipping mine back. I do not recommend Sharp based on my experience."
1,Gears strip on many systems,"My unit didn't hold up well at all. Makes a horrible grinding sound. Did some checking and learned this is a ""very common problem with this model"" and it's an issue they don't suggest you self-repair. I read that as a design flaw. The main drive gear that powers the fuser strips out. Can't get to it easily. Nice features but the copier gave out quickly."
2,Digital All-in-One Printer,Returned as the description said that it also faxes but found out that the description was inaccurate. Amazon accepted the return and issued credit for the full amount.
4,If you need drivers...,"I spent some time trying to hunt down drivers -- the XP drivers posted at the main Sharp website and elsewhere were not functional. After a phone call, I was directed to the Canadian Sharp website (Sharp.ca), which has functioning XP drivers (use drivers for the AL1651). They also have 32 and 64 bit drivers for vista and win7"
1,Incompatible with Windows Vista,"I loved this printer, until I upgraded to Windows Vista 64 bit. Silly me. Sharp will NOT provide a driver for this equipment. That it is still being sold is outrageous. Of course I had just purchased an $80 toner cartridge for this monstrosity, and now all I can do with it is photocopy: no printing or scanning. STAY AWAY. There are plenty of other products that will allow you to actually USE them."
1,JUNK MACHINE - DO NOT BUY,"The machine does not have fax capability. Also, Sharp does not have drivers to make it work with Windows vista. I would avoid Sharp altogether. Have had bad luck with three separate Sharp machines."
1,Buy Something Else,"This is the second Sharp mutli-function unit I have had. They are junk! The USB 2.0 stopped working fairly soon. After about a year is started jamming all the time. Sharp support said it was beyond the warrenty and it was my tuff luck. I had simialr problems with my first Sharp machine, an earilier model. This lasted about 18 months, about 10,000 cycles. Sharp support is awful. Buy a Brother or a H-P."
3,Great quality but not very functional,"This case looks great, seems to be made of a good quality leather, and the player fits it like a glove, the problem is you have a hard time operating the controls simply due to the thickness of the case, but great price so if you really want leather and you want to take time to get used to reaching the buttons it would be ok."
2,Ok But Not Great,Ok i bought this cause i thought it would be good for protection it ends up it really isn't the best product i should have got the silicone case you can;t hardly push the buttons left and right or up and downso just get a silicone case
4,good for small stuff,"This works well to pick up small pieces of jewelry, but go slow. It is helpful, but magnet isn't very strong."
2,Very flimsy,"Very, very flimsyIf you buy it, be very, very careful with lengthening and shortening it, as well as any use at all whatsoever.It may appear solid, but it is much flimsier than you'll expectMine broke within five minutes (no joke)"
4,So far so good!,"I picked the AEM CAI after reading about intakes for my 2005 mazda 3 2.3L for a while. This one doesn't make too much of a stupid ""whirrr"" noise when accelerating but gives a good performance gain! Install was pretty easy, but taking the stock airbox out was a pain in the butt. Follow the directions, take your time, and it'll come out....Good product although after a month or so it was thrown a CEL that is LEAN on bank 1, or 4... I can't remember. Most forums say this can be safely ignored with CAI's and people have measured that the motor is NOT ACTUALLY LEAN, it just thinks it is due to the CAI differences. We'll see...."
3,Cold air,"I didn't notice a difference in gas mileage but got a little more power. On my 2006 Mazda 3 it was a pain to put in, had to remove the whole front bumper just to get to the intake. So I hope you have some time."
5,Norma Jean is the best,Any cd With Norma Jean On it Is Great The In Person Cd is great Country Music . Norma Jean Can Sing any song Super good
5,Memories are fulfilled,"Thanks for providing me something that I thought is lost forever. I found the song, and now I play it to remind me the gap in my life that I have lost. I love playing this song. My collection of new wave songs is fulfilled."
4,A Fantastic Group - An Ok CD,"The first Book of Love song I heard was Modigliani (Lost in Your Eyes)in a club back in the 80's. Since then I have loved this group. With dreamy vocals over rich synth pop music - Book of Love have created some of the best songs to come out of this genre.I do think some other songs could have been included on this CD. Witchcraft & You Make Me Feel So Good are two that come to mind.If you are purchasing your first Book of Love CD, this is a good sample of their music. But do try and get their first two CDs: Book of Love & Lullaby. These two albums have some great songs that are left off this compilation."
4,Book of Love for sale,"After a eight year hiatus, Book of Love is back. This ""Best of"" collection brings together several of their earlier hits (""Boy""), some of their later obscure hits (""Counting the Rosaries"", two new tracks (""Try and Getting Faster""), and a early rarity called ""It's In Your Eyes"". Well known as the group that opened for Depeche Mode in the eighties, Book of Love started out with bang with their first album but failed to gather momentum into the nineties as grunge basically eradicated the synth driven alternative music Book of Love is associated with. Early hits such as ""I Touch Roses"" and ""Pretty Boys and Pretty Girls"" are indictive of what I loved about Book of Love, swirling synths, deadpan vocals, and catchy choruses. Later songs such as ""Hunny Hunny"" and ""Alice Everyday"" make me cringe with trite lyrics and what basically amounts to a Brady Bunch style musical production. In the end however, Book of Love always manage to redeem themselves with Ted Ottaviano's musicianship."
4,Ask the fans,"I`ve been a book of love fan for over 20 years. The first song I ever heard was ""Boy"", here in Guayaquil my hometown. I borrowed it from a friend of mine, and I never returned it.The first two albums (in the 80`s) were the best, even though I loved Candy Carol; Love bubble was good with Sound and Vision and Hunny Hunny being the best songs.This greatest hits is missing some great singles such as Sound and vision, With a Little Love, Witchcraft, Miss Melancholy, Champagne wishes. Record companies and the bands should make a survey and ASK THE FANS for some of the songs to be included.Erasure made a poll through their web site, before the European tour. They asked the fans to make a list of the songs to be played at every concert.Just an idea."
5,"A ""Must Have"" for any Phantom fan","Dealing mainly with the Andrew Lloyd Webber musical ""Phantom of the Opera,"" this book also gives a good history of the original novel and other filmed and stage versions of the story. The book is worth the price for the beautiful photographs and behind the scenes stories alone. It is a perfect for anyone who is interested in the story of the Phantom"
5,Wonderful!,"As a true ""Phantom Phan"", I was thrilled to discover such a detailed, informative, and exquisitely illustrated guide to the legacy of the Phantom. In no other work have I found such lovely pictures, such descriptive and vivid narration, and such a meticulous, well thought out layout.I highly recommend this work to any Phantom fan, as well as those looking for a thorough, highly entertaining introduction to The Phantom of the Opera. Enjoy~"
5,An Excellent Book for Phantom Lovers,"In the past year my friend and I have really gotten into the play and found this book very informative. It told us plenty of stuff we never knew. I think this is a great book for those who love plays or the Phantom of the Opera. I also think it is a very good read becouse it tells you about the actual Paris Grand Opera and the building of it, it covers the movies, the Lloyd Webber version and has the complete libretto."
3,Not the best Jack McDuff album,"If you should have just one Jack McDuff album, I would rather go for ""The Honeydripper""."
3,an early Bergman classic.,"This review is for the Criterion DVD edition of the film.Sawdust and Tinsel released in Sweden as ""Gycklarnas afton"" is about the owner of a travelling circus and his girlfriend.The film has been described by Criterion as a battle of the sexes film. This could be considered an understatement. This also led to the censors cutting five minutes from the film for the American release. These scenes are included here for the first time in the United States.The DVD includes two special features. A 2003 introduction to the film by director Ingmar Bergman, and audio commentary by Peter Cowie.This is mediocre when compared to the later Bergman films but still is one that should be seen."
3,"Quite solid, if not exceptional","Sawdust and Tinsel is not an exceptional work by Ingmar Bergman. But still it is highly praised by many fans who love his specific cinematic expression. At the beginning of the film, there is a near-perfection scene, taking the best from the German silent cinema of 30's. Harriet Andersson's performance is very good and the rest of the cast is also quite good. Solid Bergman."
1,It truly is a piece of a vomit,"Whoever called this movie a piece of vomit was right on the mark. I am one of Bergman's most devoted fans and I think movies such as the ""Seventh Seal"" and ""Smiles from a Summer Night"" are among the best films ever produced but I can only find ""Sawdust and Tinsel"" to be disgustingly pretentious and thourougly uninteresting. However, even if some modern, revisionist critics have been intimidated by Bergman's reputation into finding this movie ""an important stepping stone for his later works,"" why watch it? Go watch the later works themselves! After all, even the revisionists will agree that they're the only reason ""Sawdust and Tinsel"" is important (aside from being a good demonstration of how bad a film can possibly be)."
4,Okay for elementary level,I bought this one because I wanted my own copy as a teacher.But it does not match the original from the library. That made it a little difficult to use. I work with 2nd graders and the new copy had higher vocabulary and more complex sentences.Still a very good storyline and message.
4,The best layman's source about the science of stress.,"Why Zebras...is a thought provoking, sometimes disturbing, insight into the workings of the human being. If you think the stress in your life might kill you, you could be right! Robert Sapolsky's writing style enlightens while educating and he doesn't speak ""over"" the abilities of those of us who are outside the field of science."
4,Very interesting read.,"I really enjoyed this brook, If you like learning about the body you will like this, It does get a bit scientific at times but overall a great read."
5,"Funny, still up-to-date, and essential info if you're invested in your health","I was half expecting to be sifting through outdated material, but this was surprisingly still fresh, and compelling. It's nicely paced, and organized in a way you can skip chapters that don't feel relevant. Everyone who is responsible for maintaining an optimally-performing staff *needs* to read this."
4,solid release,"i see the members here have a few hardcore miles under the belts,i feel you want it to be a classic and review it the same.but i give 4 stars because i feel there is something missing,cant say what but it`s there."
3,A great peek into the past,"This little book (part of the Cornell University Press Development of Western Civilization series) provides a nice, easy-to-read peek into mediaeval life. Contrary to common belief, the span of time between 900 and 1300 saw substantial intellectual and economic growth in Western Europe. During this time, populations largely shifted from scattered manorial clusters to towns and cities. Patterns of trade became more complex and the period witnessed the rise of the merchant class. This is a great guide for casual students of world history by a leading scholar in the field. You may also be interested in Sidney Painter's other book in this series,The Rise of the Feudal Monarchies."
2,The end of a great band.....,"As stated by other reviewers this album is not that good. It has some strong tracks like 'How could you ever leave me' and 'Hot Tonight', but thats about it. The band lost their edge after Paul Reynolds left. Mike Score came out with 'Light at the End of the world' in 1994 or 1995,which is a worthy follow up to 'Story of a Young Heart'. This one is best left in the dark. ***Die Hard Fans Only***"
1,Dream Come True is a Nightmare,"The only thing the elevated Flock Of Seagulls above the rest of the euro-80's-new wave pack was the under-rated, but brilliant, guitar work of Paul Reynolds. He left the band before this album and they didn't even bother to replace him, they just added more cheesy keyboards. The result sounds like 4th rate Thompson Twins and completely fails to capture the sound or energy of the the first 3 albums."
1,SHOCKING!!!,"I am amazed they reissued this without adding bonus tracks like probably their best song 'Cosmos (Effect of the Sun)' b-side to 'Heartbeat like a Drum' 12inch. HOW? I don't care since I perfectly transferred that song to CD. You truly don't know Flock without hearing Cosmos.Sad pathetic reissue to a poor album to begin with. Outright embarrassing corny lyrics displayed here. I don't mind the attempt at a new style of sound here, I have a soft spot for 'Heartbeat like a Drum' but Mike Score truly has nothing left to say. 'Dream Come True' represents the complete end of this once brilliant band."
2,worst from the flock,"I do not like this CD much. Any other CD they have done EVER is better than this one. I am happy it is seeing the light of day but if you want to get into the flock try anything else. My favorite is ""story of the young heart'"
3,Reynolds MIA,"Starts out fairly good with ""Better and Better"" ""Heart Beat like a Drum"" could have been better... don't like the background vocals. ""Who's that girl"" reminds me of the Madonna Movie. It's okay but doesn't sound like an AFOS song. I erased the down on your knees thing. It is now a more complete album, if that makes sense. ""Whole lot of loving"" I actually like this song for some reason. It's like when you go to your favorite resturant and some new cook changes the recipes. The band is missing Reynolds. AFOS is the four not just Mike Score."
2,Fuzzy Image,"The DVD's work OK as far as reading/writing the data, but the quality of the lightscribe image is poor for these disks compared to other brands. Given the premium you pay for the lightscribe disk, I was very dissapointed by the low quality of the image. I printed the same image on these disks and disks from another manufacturer, and the image on the memorex was very fuzzy, and low contrast compared to the other brand. Unfortunately I bought a spindle of these, but will not buy this type again."
4,The Playful Brain,"Dr. Jack (Harold Lloyd) is a friend to all the people in a small town. His methods aren't entirely traditional, but the people he is surrounded by aren't really average people. He deals with children trying to play hooky from school (Mickey Daniels), gamblers who tend to waste their paychecks on one game, and lonely old women. In the city, there is a girl (Mildred Davis, Lloyd's future wife) called the Sick Little Well Girl (obviously a playful jab at the Poor Little Rich Girl). Although it seems there is nothing wrong with her, her fancy doctor prescribes all sorts of remedies that make her miserable. That is, until Dr. Jack steps in.This film is short and sweet, just the way a comedy should be. There are plenty of funny scenes; some of them are subtle like the card playing bit and some are slapstick comedy like the chase scene at the end."
4,Good dance music,"I first heard the song follow the leader in Cancun night clubs and it was awesome. The whole cd is cool, i like the redone version of hey baby, it is very jamaican sounding with some kewl dance songs and it is in english too.it is definately worth buying, even just for the first song."
2,What a disappointment,"Amazon doesn't do a very good job of describing this book. It is a humongous board book and the toy train is meant to travel within a groove on various pages of the book. Not what I wanted at all! I was very disappointed to find that the illustrations were not the original--they are of a much, much lower quality. I have no idea what I am going to do with this thing!"
4,Good but not as edgy as her early stuff,"An engaging graphic novel, but hard-core Barry fans are apt to be a little disappointed in this new ""autobifictionalography,"" especially if they've read ""My Perfect Life,"" which covers a lot of the same ground. Age seems to have mellowed Barry's demons, and the switch from pen and ink to brush and watercolor has definitely taken the edge off her graphic style. It would be nice if some publisher seized the moment to re-issue more of Barry's early volumes that have fallen out of print, such as ""Girls and Boys"" and ""Big Ideas,"" which are hard to find even on the net. Talk about your demons!"
3,It was alright.,"I really don't like the art, but the art style grew on me as I read this book, making it tolerable by the end. Overall the content was incredibly relatable, but the delivery was extremely flawed. I just can't get over the random switching between script and printing in the text. It wasn't done to highlight certain words, so far as I can tell, or in a particular pattern. It was incredibly frustrating."
3,Holy Cow! This is the okayest book ever written!,This is the Okayest book I have ever Read! More Okay than anything else I have read EVER! Some people should Definately READ THIS BOOK!
5,Lynda Barry -- Goddess of All That Is Cool!,"This book is utterly, totally amazing! Lynda Barry rocks my world! If you are a Lynda Barry fan, whether a Pookster or someone who loved ""Cruddy"", this book is a must-read. The illustrations are epic, and the stories are alternatingly heart-warming and gut-wrenching. A brave and beautiful effort."
5,Delightful!!!,"Lynda Barry's graphic novel One Hundred Demons is a sweet, sweet read. She manages to weave seemingly unrelated thoughts and threads together (like lice and love!) into a treasure trove of wonderful little stories about growing up and getting along. Everything about this book is charming and relatable--the illustrations, the writing, and the tales themselves. Reading it made me feel as though I were chatting with an old friend. My heart has been won!"
4,I cried over almost every story,"Lynda Barry is so amazing with her honesty. Every story resonated with me: she didn't try to paint herself in a great light, but showed the truth -- which blew me away.Thank you, Lynda, for being so honest. I cried, cried, cried cuz I saw myself in your stories. So many regrets I have after years and years, myself. So many people who I was cruel to; so many things I screwed up."
5,Superbly written and a visual treat to boot!,"Lynda Barry's ""One Hundred Demons,"" is a stunning autobiographical novel both in the constructed narrative as well as the overall visual style. Each chapter chronicles events in her childhood ranging in emotion from the nostalgic and whimsical all the way to sad and completely upsetting. Written with complete honesty and lack of censure one can't help but feel moved at the seminal moments in Barry's life that she shares with her readers in this book. While the writing alone is worth the price of admission the ultimate bonus is the construction of the book itself (very handsome) along with Barry's wonderful artwork. This time readers are treated not only to Barry's signature comic sketches but a plethora of found-art collages as well to complement each chapter."
4,Remember When Music Meant Something?,One Grain of Sand..........something beyond money! Odetta is one of a kind and a true lady of the spiritual and civil rights movements of the 50's and 60's.
5,Great research!,"This is one of the few books that open new perspectives for research, suggesting that children and childhood gained in importance in British Fiction well before the 19th century. It seeks to show the importance of the figure of the child in a variety of novels. The study is chronologically organised and very easy to follow. The edition itself is with hard covers. Paper of high quality. I am very picky when it comes to fonts but here, I can find nothing to criticise :) I am extremely satisfied!"
2,"Shallow, poorly constructed, vague","I am disappointed with this book. It is extremely brief and provides a shallow overview of Irish (Republic) history and culture. It is vague, and, despite being updated recently, still references 'The Troubles' as serious ongoing problems in Northern Ireland. The author states that the book is only good for Republic of Ireland, and since I""m going to be in Northern Ireland, it is of little help to me.In general, the information in this book is of little assistance, and is unenlightening at best."
4,So this is how it started....,The pilot is interesting because it doesnt vary that much from the actual series as some pilots do.Worth collecting if you are into this series.
4,Intro to Stargate Atlantis,This was an informative DVD. I had missed the transition show from SG-1 to Atlantis. It was a great introduction to the new characters.
5,Pleased to adopt atlantis as a new collection,This is the first program of the atlantis series and if you get the first season series this will be a duplication. If you are timid to buy the first season collection this will convince you to buy the series. SUPER in the stargate style.
3,Stargate Atlantis Commercial,"I have to say that I really love both SG1 and Stargate. I have purchased all SG1 Boxed Sets. But I dont think I will buy this DVD, They Did The same with the introduction of the SG1 series, first the Pilot with an additionl episode then another , another, then the Box Set Idea. it was really expensive then. anyway this new Atlantis Rising (pilot) looks like a Episode with commercials, you get new ""previews"" or commercials of the next season, plus a preview of the new SG1 game out soon, I would just wait for the Full 1st Season DVD to be released, I am sure too that MGM will RE-rlease the first few SG1 DVD boxed sets because of the ever popular commentarys that were not on the first Couple Seasons, that Id like to have."
3,If you like things piecemeal...,"The pilot for this series has its good points, but tucked in between the stunning special effects and amazing ideas are weak plot lines and bad acting. I felt like I was being tossed into an ocean of information, all of it coming too fast for me to process adequately. I would buy this in the season one dvd set, but to buy it on it's own is simply ludicrous! Take my advice. Wait for the entire thing. The acting gets better, the stories go slower, and the special effects make you realize how good the series really is."
5,happy to be surprised,"This is a great series, I love it, din't think I would watch it until I started catching up on it on reruns and I have to say I cant wait for season 2 and I will definitely buy the set when is for sale, I like sets better than single discs but if I was in a country where it was first on disc before anywhere else I would buy that way.I really hated Atlantis the first time I catched it out of order...watched like 5 minutes and switch off, but then I started watching it in order and its A GREAT series, and if you never seen stargate SG1 its ok since one of the main characters also didn't know about the stargate so everything is explain to a point.I'm making someone watch it with me and they've never seen SG1 and they like the new series.So my recommendation is ""watch it from the beginning! you might be pleasantly surprised"""
1,Disappointed in your advertising.,"Since I did not reaiize the pilot was also the ""first episode"", I was very disappointed to have purchased it twice. Once as the pilot and once as the first episode of Stargate Atlantis - season one.Evidently, my fault for not having ever watched Stargate Atlantis before, but still frustrating!"
1,For college guys only,"I guess if you are a male college student getting stoned in your dorm room and watch this movie you may think is ""awesome"". If that's not you stay away. Ramblings of an artsy writer wanna be that takes himself way too seriously, makes for one dull movie.Sorry to the fans of this but all I can say is keep up your studies and get rid of that bong."
1,to much bling and no recourse,ok if your reading this you may be intrested in rolex . so buy wisely . first if this watch were ever to go back to rolex they would and will confiscate it . this day date has been pimped out and rolex will only service as the watch was sold originally and beleive me they have to much class and to much money to have ever sold this watch as an original. save your money and buy only from an authorized dealer . see my other reviews
5,"Best Option for sick, stubborn kids!","My boys have never been good at taking liquid medications- more often then not they would gag and spit it out (can you blame them, most of that stuff is nasty!) With these I can be sure that they get the full, correct dosage with little fuss."
5,These save us during teething!,Our doctor gave us suppositories after my son would projectile vomit all liquid tylenol. About 30 minutes after he gets one he's happy and will normally take a nap. These have been such a life saver while my poor baby's molars have been breaking through! I consider these a must-have baby item. Just make sure the dosing is appropriate with your child's weight. Our doctor told us to bump up to the 120mg (we were using 80mg before.) I don't think there's any dose lower than 80mg however.Feverall is by far the best brand as well. They don't have any recalls like some of the other brands and their packaging is the easiest to open. The CVS brand was impossible to open and I would often have to get scissors and try to salvage the dose. We always use Feverall now.
5,So Cute and So Functional,"It took me a long time to commit to a good, quality diaper bag, but I have to say even though I definitely hesitated at the price tag, I absolutely love this bag. It is worth every penny! In fact, I have two Skip Hop Diaper Bags: the Dash in Uptown Stripe and the Duo-Double in Ocean Stripe.It's very durable, and I am pretty tough on my things.It's super-functional. The pockets are plentiful, accessible (so long as you don't over pack the bag), and practical. There is no waste of space or annoying dividers.I throw my ""purse contents"" into the inside ""Mommy Pocket"" and don't feel like I am carrying a diaper bag. I feel like I am carrying my own bag and throwing baby supplies into it.I love the strap system. I not only clip it to the back of my stroller, I also clip it to shopping carts.I highly recommend this bag."
2,Not too happy with the quality,"I can't fit much in this bag without the magnetic closures popping open. The stitching on the liner on the inside that seperates compartments came undone after less than a year and is flimsy. I've got two in diapers now and there is no way I can continue with this one any more. Three diapers, a half empty bag of Kirkland wipes, one change of clothes, and an insulator pack for breast milk, prooved to be too much for the main compartment. Pockets for the bottle and a water bottle on the sides are the only perks I can put on here, but most diaper bags have that, sooooo...I think I've said enough."
5,Great diaper bag!,"I've used a couple of other diaper bags (one cheap, one very expensive), but this is the best by far. It has lots of pockets so I know exactly where everything is. Diapers and wipes fit perfectly and the side pockets even fit Avent bottles. The neutral color is great for men and women. Big enough to travel with. I wish I had bought it sooner!"
5,We love this bag!,"I did a lot of research on diaper bags when I was pregnant, and when I found the Skip Hop Dash, I knew I could stop looking! It was everything I wanted - messenger bag, lots of pockets, perfect size, and a wide range of color choices. Because my husband and I would both be carrying the bag, we decided to get the Charcoal (if I had been getting it just for myself, I would have had a harder time choosing between the charcoal and the ice blue, but I think Charcoal was the better choice because it doesn't show dirt!).We have been using the bag for 5 weeks now and I absolutely love it. There is honestly nothing I have found about the bag that I would change. It's perfect for us!"
3,"Great, but...","I love the ""non-baby"" colors of this bag. After two other babies, I was ready for a bag without Pooh, bunnies and pastels. The brown & pink were great colors that went with everything I was wearing (as opposed to all the other bags that just coordinated with the baby!)The ONLY draw back that I've found is that there isn't much ""Mommy Space"" in this bag. There are two small front pockets that don't hold much and certainly aren't secure enough to hold a wallet or cell phone. The only other space is a zipper pocket inside the bag, which is just a pain to get to when you need something quick.Overall, it's not a bad bag, but I would look for another small bag for shopping or quick trips... this is definitely an all day out, only baby stuff sort of bag."
3,"it's ok, but not great!",for tye price i was epecting a bigger bag. all the compartments are great but really not big enough for two kids other than an afternoon out.
1,Ugly Colors!!,This bag is a very gross color of brown. The pink and the brown do not even go with each other. The bag also has a black strap making this a very un-coordinated product. Returned it for something else.
5,Brings Back Great Memories,As a child of the 80s/90s this was a treat to see this. Great seeing all of my favorite characters and how the Showbiz Pizza Place came about with The Rockafire Explosion. For those that think Chuck E Cheese is good then you missed out on a true experience with the Rockafire Explosion. They need to bring it back and maybe include Chuck E Cheese into the mix but the old team was much better. Everything went down heel when they changed it from Showbiz Pizza Place to Chuck E Cheese.
4,Fun Trip Down Memory Lane,"A nice review of my childhood! I spend a lot of time at Showbiz Pizza as a kid and loved the Rock-Afire Explosion! I was nice to see other fans appreciate and get a little history of the business and the show. I would have liked to expand the scope of the documentary but over all it was entertaining but for a limited audience who were aware of the ""band"". I would have been nice to see more musical performances to get an idea of what we all loved about them."
2,Awkward,"Lots of info on their personal lives (esp Chris') which had nothing to do with the band, as if they were trying to play up the creepiness factor. Almost no info about the technical aspects of the show, which was the main reason I wanted to watch it. I like documentaries but this one feel short in several ways. Go watch the YouTube videos of the new programmed songs instead."
5,Great DVD,Great DVD on The Rock-Afire Explosion. Brings back great memoreies of Show Biz Pizza and how it all came together and went away.
3,Interesting but not as awesome as hoped,"The good-Genuinely interesting story-Likeable, awkward characters-Cool behind the scenes info-Lots of nostalgic footageThe bad-Awkwardly long scenes-Not enough historical background-Not enough source material-Should have found a way to include more of the Youtube videos-The outtakes at the end were like awkward squared."
5,Bittersweet tale of childhood dreams,"This was a wonderful, well-made documentary. The Rock-afire Explosion animatronic band, found at Showbiz Pizza Place during the eightees, was the culmination of Aaron Fechter's drive to bring something special to the world in the face of adversity. The film gives a bittersweet, candid look into Fechter's warehouse, frozen in time for 20+ years following the purchase of Showbiz Pizza Place by Chuck E Cheese. His positive attitude and hopes for the future is at once inspiring and his humorous point of view is infectious. The film also examines a group of enthusiasts who grew up enjoying Fechter's creations, and have since made it their life's passion to collect not only the memorabilia, but the showpieces and animatronics themselves. One couple has even gone so far as to open an actual Showbiz Pizza restaurant, complete with a working show. This film recaptures the spirit of a lost piece of nostalgia, and a desire for the simpler times of childhood."
3,The Rock-afire Explosion,"I had always wondered why Fatz and the gang at Showbiz Pizza were replaced by the inferior Chuck E. Cheese - this flim finally explains it all. It was interesting to hear from the Rock-afire Explosion's creator and see what's become of the characters since their mysterious exit. That said, this documentary seemed a bit amateurish - some of the interviews felt a little disingenuous, a little forced. Some of the side stories didn't really fit with the major theme of the film and were distracting. It was still fun to watch though and I'm sure this would appeal to anyone who remembers going to Showbiz as a kid."
5,"Simplistic, High Quality, & Innovative","After lugging around large bags with uncomfortable straps I decided to look for something low profile and comfortable. I settled on this bag with worries about it fitting my Canon 40D comfortably. At first I struggled with the fit, but after getting used to it, the camera fits snug even with the lens hood mounted reverse. The only potential problem is the fact that my neck strap can't fit in with the camera, but with a smaller SLR I think it would fit fine.The material might be the nicest part of this bag, as it stretches and repels water. It also has a pocket on the front, big enough for a usb cable and a memory card and two side pockets, perfect for extra batteries.Overall, I'm very pleased with the bag. I also purchased an OP/Tech Neoprene case for extra protection. That fits the Canon 40D with 128MM lens Perfectly."
1,Obviously has no idea what economics is all about.,"This is, frankly, a poor book. It is a mediocre history of US economic diplomacy since WWII, but it is episodic in nature and fails to really tie together the ebb and flow of international diplomacy over economic issues. It also entirely fails to discuss the economic theory that governs politics in this area such as rent-seeking, two-level games, and even the Ricardo-Viner or Stophler(sp?)-Samuelson models of international trade. Moreover, in stressing the importance of the US military-industrial complex as a source of economic growth and job creation during this period, she totally ignores concepts basic to economics and economic analysis -- opportunity and transaction costs -- and so wrongly argued that the vast amount of capital spent on the military was GOOD for the US economy. She also, to add to the poor analysis everywhere evident in this book, fails to show any real correlation between military spending and economic growth.BAD BOOK!"
2,Broke in 20 minutes,"Worked great for about 20 minutes then it broke in half. Its a great idea, but needs to be far more durable. My son is 5 years old and weighs about 40 lbs...he isn't a big kid. The E-Z bar broke at the pivot behind the seat after about 10 rides over a 20 minute period.Product worked great up until then. We were making great progress. I would like to order another one, but the pivot is very weak and I'm faily sure the next one will also break. Too bad...this product could have been really great."
2,Did Not Work Well for Us,I absolutely love this concept but it did not work well for us. It is very difficult to hold the bicycle up with this especially around any sort of turn. I do not recommend this item.
3,"Great concept, fell short and my kid crashed","I bought this to help my daughter gain confidence in her riding abilities. She is terrified of falling off her bike. Her fear affects her biking skills especially when first getting going. My daughter is 6 years old and small for her age, only about 40 lbs.She does loves to ride but the training wheels on her bike were not the right size, the fit caused her to tip at times and eventually they bent. I thought the E-Z bar was a great solution. The hinge pin broke on the unit after the second time I used it. She was leaning and I was trying to straighten her out when it broke and she fell. We went back to training wheels and using her scooter.Glad to see this product works for some other kids and parents but it is hanging broken in our garage."
5,Classical Guitar meets Jazz,"This is an outstanding piece of music. The guitar is very spanish in the style of Rodrigez ""Concierto d'Aranjuez"". It is accompanied by a Jazz Trio, which sometimes swings, sometimes is in a very classical mood. Together they are fantastic. Just buy, listen and swing."
4,Calamari,"This squid product is quite nice. The ink and the condiments are on target. I did not quite enjoy the fact that the calamari was sliced rather than packed in chunks. nevertheless the portion of ink made up for that. It's quite right to cook the mediterranean ""black rice"" with onions, tomatoe paste, olives, garlic powder and a hint of hot sauce (and capers if you are into). Overall I am pleased with this product."
3,Notas good as I hoped,"I was hoping for more ""ink"", but quality and taste are good I probably would buy squid ink alone next time."
5,Very Addicting,"Excellent music,extremely talented, and very addicting. I think almost everyone can relate to ""I Wanna Know"" and ""Somebody Lied"". I'm sure the next c.d. will be just as good if not better than this one, can't wait to hear it! Best of luck!"
4,Bigfoot: An Honest Piece of Film,"Bigfoot is the sort of film that harkens to a more simple time in direct to video horror films and feels as home-spun as it's Ohio setting. A man and his cop friend taking on a gigantic missing-link, it's a simple plot that lets you just turn off your brain and enjoy the ride.The Bigfoot suit in the movie was actually quite well made and it's movements were well choreographed too. While this is a fairly tame movie compared to other films in the Troma canon, it's hokey, but still fun and likeable. I recommend it."
2,tierd,The title and picture on the front fools you - thought this was gonna be a cool movie boy was I wrong I want my money back
5,TRACK LIST,1) The Pages Turn 2) Come On Home 3) Where I Live 4) I'll Be There 5) When I Saw You Smile 6) Incompatibility 7) Two Fathers Cry 8) Drifting Away 9) If You Leave A Hurt 10) It Is Well With My Soul
5,House warming gift purchase,"After seeing a similar product at someone house I started searching for one on the net.My girlfriend and her son have bunches of shoes and tend to leave them directly in front of every door they walk into. I thought what a great idea to stop this nonsense. I actually purchased two, one for each entry way from outside. Now, this does not stop them from leaving them everywhere, but helps somewhat.Once we moved in we had several boxes stacked along a wall and fell over on shoe rack and bent the top rack. I adjusted it and still works just fine."
4,"Revolving Shoe Tree, Chrome","I am pleased with the quality of this rack with one exception - the chrome holders are a little too close together and some of the shoes have to be smashed up against one another. It is very well built, sturdy and looks very nice."
4,Works well,"It is incredible how it cleaned a corner of my room that used to have a pile of shoes in it. When it is fully loaded, it can be a little difficult to turn. But it was super easy to put together. It also does not sit as high off the ground, as I thought it would. I am very pleased with my purchase."
2,Don't recommend for mix of men/women shoes/sandals,"We had high hopes for this but are disappointed. Even with all my male shoes on the bottom tier, it leans from side to side. Not very stable. We assembled it correctly and it can't be tightened anymore. It might be better filled with children shoes or light female shoes. Plus, I don't like having to touch the bottom of my shoes to put them on the rack and take them off the rack, but that's just a personal quirk."
5,whitney design 2131 18-pair revolving shoe tree,love this product simple to put together and all my shoes are compact and take up a lot of less space.
5,stands up,I've owned this shoe tree for several years and I love it. My kids knock it over often and even stand on it and it just takes it.
1,not what its cracked up to be!,"I purchase a product similar to this and it would not hold adult shoes as nice as it looks. Its ok for very lite shoes (kids) small shoes like toddlers... It didn't hold my size 7.5 shoes and one side was slightley heavier one the one level it would wobble and fall over. Worked great for 3 year olds shoes, until she decided to break it.... not the best product out there, i wouldn't buy it again... would rather leave them in a pile on the floor, cause thats where they end up anyways."
5,I suffer from Imelda Marcus Syndrome,I was pleasantly surprised with the product - at long last the floor of my closet is clear - it no longer takes me 15 minutes to find a matching pair of shoes - bought 2 of them - gave 1 to my niece - she loves it and so do I.
4,EVEN BIGFOOT LIKED IT,"I bought this for my husband for Christmas and it's been great. Easy to assemble. Takes up little floor space. Big and study enough to hold a man's dress shoes, athletic shoes, etc."
5,Excactly what I wanted,This was purchased as a Christmas gift. The recipient was extremely satisfied with it! Perfect! Definitely would recommend to others.
2,Bent basketI,"I received this product, was easy to assemble, Except that one of the shoe baskets was bent where center is attached to the support rod. Making all of the spokes bent at odd angles. The packaging was intact, and the box all appeared that it was originally from the manufacturer. Meaning that they have very poor quality control. WAS not due to the shipper ONTRAC that provided easy fast excellent service. In all I would NOT recommend to buy a product from this business unless you ARE NOT worried about quality."
3,Shoe Tree,"This actually helped me organize my closet...and, it's easy to find the shoes that I'm looking for since the tree spins."
4,Not bad at all...,"It's really not bad. It is perfect for small places and the fact that it spins is a plus too- you don't have to reach behind to get the shoes that are on the back of the rack. The reason I gave it 4 stars is because it doesn't handle longer shoes well; I have couple of winter pairs that reach above my ankle, and even thou they stay on the rack, they're a little wobbly and they fall off if I happen to bump against the rack or hit it with something."
5,Great Value,"In my quest to keep my collection of shoes organized, I purchased both a large shoe rack to hold boxes of shoes and this shoe carousel. The carousel is convenient, was easy to put together, takes up a small amount of floor space and is very sturdy. Great value for the low price I paid."
3,Sturdy but TALL!,"This shoe tree is certainly well-made and holds 18 pairs of shoes neatly in a small space, but I was surprised how TALL it actually was. Of course I should have paid more attention to the dimensions but I didn't. I have finally taken the top off and only use two holders. Measure your closet before you buy this. If you have room, you will love it."
3,Shoe rack,"I would say it is good for small shoes only, since the space between the revolving panels is a little too small. In my case the product also had a defect where one of the revolving holders does not revolve."
5,Space saver shoe holder,"I had too many shoes and too little space, but could never find something taller that would fit in the same space as a vinyl shoe rack that I had. I've been looking for a long time, but found nothing except racks that took up a lot of space. I found this in a catalog, then decided to look on Amazon. Voila! Exact same shoe tree, $20.00 cheaper! The racks revolve so you can reach the shoes easily. Granted, all your shoes soles on public display do not look glamorous, but oh well! It seems to be stable on its base and was very easy to assemble. A bargain and a problem solver."
3,Quality issues,Pros:- holds shoes- looks nice and compactCons:- wobbly- not good for larger shoes- lots of rust stains present when opened
5,Shoe Tree Great Buy!,"Used to be kids' shoes all over the house. Now that they each have their own shoe tree, they think 'hanging shoes' from the tree is great fun. What a great idea! Why didn't I think of it sooner? And very easy to put together (well, to be fair, it wasn't me who did it, but that's the report)."
2,Rusty platform,This product is versatile and what I expected- However it did arrive from the vendor with a rusted out base. Rather than hassle with the vendor and pay to ship it back for an exchange...we spray painted it to cover the rust. I figured it would be hiding in the closet and didn't need to look pretty- only not seep rust onto the carpet.
3,Shoe rack dosn't look good with shoes in it,"The shoe rack looks great in the photo, but when you get shoes on it, all you see are the soles of the shoes. Not too attractive. Also not easy to pick out the shoes, since all you see are the bottoms. The shoes are a bit crowded on the rack, and I have small feet."
4,shoe tree,A great little invention- hardly takes up any space & holds a lot of shoes- only one con- if you have wide shoes-like clogs-they get squished- otherwise- I'll probably get another!
2,Don't bother with this product,"This shoe rack has good intentions, but doesn't live up to the expectations. When it arrived, I put it together, per instructions, noting not to tighten the plastic holders too tight of they would break, needless to say, they broke and had to call the company to order new ones. They arrived 3 weeks later (free of charge). The replacements were gently placed on the shoe rack, but I'm just waiting for them to pop off. So far, so good. If I had it to do over, I would choose something else."
5,Great Space Saver,This is one of those purchases that you have to tell people about! The Revolving Shoe Tree is easy and quick to assemble and is heavy duty when complete. It takes up very little space and holds plenty of shoes. The racks smoothly twirl to allow easy access to your shoes. I love it and plan to buy one for everyone in my family. (especially the girls)
1,deceiving,"i thought this would be a great idea for maximizing my closet space. when you get the box its rather heavy and think its sturdy. it was a pain in the [...] to put together. they give the tools(allen wrenches) and its awkward to screw the racks on the stem. the base is heavy but the stem is very very flimsy. having put it together and for lack of better storage i used it to store my sneakers and casual shoes. when filled its hard to spin and when you spin back you loosen the stem from the base. it is tipping to one side even though the stem is screwed in as tight as it can be, its a design flaw. a for effort in concept. f for quality. don't waste your money."
5,Going Gently into the Night,"It's a real shame that so many Fantasy/OJC CDs have been deleted in the past year, with tenor saxman Eddie ""Lockjaw"" Davis' ""Gentle Jaws"" being one of the numerous casualities. This Prestige reissue actually contains two albums originally made for the Moodsville division -- ""The Red Garland Trio"" (strangely also available asMoodsville, Volume 1) recorded December 11, 1959 featuring pianist Garland, Sam Jones on bass and Art Taylor on drums, and ""Eddie 'Lockjaw' Davis with Shirley Scott"" (Moodsville 4) from January 31, 1960 with George Duvivier on bass and Arthur Edgehill on drums. As you might gather from the label name, these performances are more on the sultry side than the smokin' one. There are certainly more intense ""Lockjaw"" dates out there, particularly ones partnering organist Scott, but it's hard to pass up this two-fer at the current discounted price. Don't wait too long or ""Gentle Jaws"" will go gently into the night."
4,The Difference is Real,"A definite upgrade from stock plastic grips. This gives me a firmer grip on my Ruger P94 with the textured material and the formed finger ridges. It allows me greater control as the pistol kicks, reducing the amount of recoil that I absorb, which helps ensure a proper cycle of ammunition while maintaining a faster line up of my sights."
5,Great Grips,These Grips Blown the stock ones out of the water. Remember you must have a large hand to use this gun. It's Pretty wide. Peace
1,Not a recommend purchase,"Pros:Easy to connect to PCCons:Terrible grain even at 4.0 MP Fine settingPoor colour saturationAuto white balance cant adapt to flourescent lightingFocus does not work well indoorsVery weak flashLengthy delay to achieve focus and between shotsHigh battery drain (even Ni-MH)Conclusion:An inexpensive 4.0 MP digital camera, but one that underperforms in every aspect. I have since returned mine and opted to spend an extra $75 to get an Olympus or Minolta instead. Other buyers would be wise to do the same."
1,"Bad product, worse service","I purchased this product to replace a 1.2 MP Olympus camera. In every aspect it is an inferior product. The 4 year old 1.2 MP camera has far superior image quality under all operating conditions. Battery life is a major issue and represents a serious design flaw. After following advice from Gateway to return the product for repair, I received a replacement which was no better. At this point, they refused to allow me to return the product stating that they do not accept returns for replaced units. They have no concept of customer service. I am now stuck with an inferior product that is essentially useless for its intended purpose."
1,DO NOT BUY!!!!,"Had this camera for just under a year, and encountered similar problems to other users.Now, I'm no photogropher so while others comlained about its poor photo quality, with valid reason, that didn't bother me as badly since it was my first digital camera.However, the1)loss of a 100+ photos,2)corruption of mem. cards,3)sudden loss of power with difficult reboots4)horrible and gahstly battery life, and5)the now total loss of power with no reboots,Makes this a just an awful buy and total waste of money. Even for a first time simple user like me. This camera should be max $50.Bottom line, PLEASE-DO NOT BUY!!!"
1,Please stay away from Gateway,"As with many others that have reviewed this camera it sucks batteries and doesn't take great pictures. To get decent images from this camera you must have the resolution and compression set at the highest quality memory robbing setting (41 images on a 64 MB card). Mine zapped a set of 2000 mAh NI-MH before even filling my 64 MB card. I got this camera used and called Gateway about having work done on the camera due to a focus problem and I was informed that they don't even work on out of warranty products. I ended up buying a Fuji FinePix 2650and it can take better pictures than the gateway, and the Fuji is only 2MP. In the Gateway's defense, it does have a lot of manual controls, which mean nothing to me. I recommend that anyone looking at digital cameras go for a brand that is well known for cameras, such as Kodak, Olympus. Also keep in mind that you get what you pay for."
1,Drains Batteries Way Way Fast!!,This camera drains batteries faster than you can replace them. I put new batteries in and take less than 10 pictures. Come back a week later and the camera doesn't have enough battery life left to even look at my 10 shots. Can't afford to keep this camera.
5,Great camera for a beginner,"The only thing I do not like about this camera is the battery lifetime. Although, I did purchase a better quality brand of rechargable batteries, and then it was fine. I took it to Europe with me, and the pictures turned out great!!! I think this camera was awesome for my first one."
2,No battery power,"This camera doesn't hold battery power at all. I placed new energizer batteries in and it displayed ""low battery"" after less than 10 pics were taken. This continued through multiple batteries of different brands. Turns out even the rechargeable batteries included in the accessory kit don't match up to the power required to run the camera. No battery has enough power to run the camera for more than a couple mins. This problem makes the camera useless! nice camera, too bad nobody can use it!"
5,Uniball Signo/EX2: Reliable Quality for a Good Price,"Being incredibly particular about pens runs in my family so I know a good quality tool when I use one and this line of pens from Uniball has never disappointed me. These pens, known as the Uniball EX2 or Uniball Signo, were first purchased 3 years ago from my local Staples store. I picked them because of the broad color selection but found they didn't skip while I was writing as many pens do. The gel ink performed consistently for the 3 years I had them, outlasting just about every other brand I've tried. I had to replace them recently and though finding them proved to be harder, I was pleased to discover Uniball hadn't changed a thing. If you like gel ink, affordable quality, this is the pen to buy."
2,Gel Pens,"The idea is great for these having the variety of colors, however, after several uses they start to leak and become very messy. Not a fan."
4,Oroville Ca Images of America,"The Images of America Oroville, CA was a wonderful collection of photos of Oroville from its inception to the early 1900s. The author demonstrated his passion for history and the town of Oroville. While I do not know him personally, I have read other historical accounts by James Lenhoff and he has a wonderful passion for the history of the greater Oroville community. As a person born and raised in Oroville, a new fact for me was that President Hoover played a part in the history of the area. I highly recommend for persons interested in the area's history or history of the California Gold Rush. Many villages, towns and cities have a Images of America book about their town which gives a wealth of historical information."
4,Oroville History Book,Good book with many black and white photographs and useful captions. Touches on everything in and around Oroville. Useful for local historians. Good Sacramento Northern Railway reference photographs.
1,Not In To English Lit By Choice,Had to study his works for an English Lit course. Best I can say is...Yuck! I needed it for a Bachelors degree.
3,Knife blades,"These knife blades are alright, but for the money, I would buy plain blades. The titanium is simply a super thin coating that wears off soon after cutting and using the blades. My favorite blades are IRWIN. They have the best quality metal and hold an edge better than these, or for that matter, any that I have used. I use knife blades daily in my job. I would not suggest these blades for the extra cost, over a normal blade."
3,OK,They are sharpe and last a little longer. But they are really designed for the lenox knife which does not last long. They will fit in most knifes but are a little loose compared to the standard stanley blade. Matter of fact a stanley blade will not even fit in the lenox knife.
3,Exam Cram: ASVAB Review,"Personally, this book did not offer the sufficient help I was looking for. The where to little examples and test prep questions; however, the science and mechanical sections are more useful in a situation where you must learn as much as you can and soon as you can. The Arithmetic sections helped in no way, and the mathematical section was vague and close to useless. Considering this book is old, it may be useful to those who are hoping to score higher on the mechanical sections of the ASVAB."
3,"Takes many, many footsteps to get there...","I ordered this book because I had seen somewhere that Georgette Heyer wrote similar stories to Agatha Cristie. And this is true, in that they both wrote English country house murder mysteries. However, Ms. Heyer takes the long road to get to the plot. Very long colorful descriptions regarding dinner parties and what not, that didn't (I feel) enhance the story line. I finally ended up cheating and skipped to the end. Also, having been written long ago, the character's speech and the settings are out-dated (no electricity and the women are ""delicate""). I'll stick with Agatha Cristie for this genre."
5,footsteps in the dark,Loved it all could hardly put it down. I've read all Heyer's romance stories and this is the first mystery I've read and it's great.
4,English haunted house meets Oscar Wilde (again),"Georgette Heyer is known mainly for her Regency romances rather than her mysteries, probably because she wrote more of them. Although all of her mysteries are good--and witty--Footsteps In The Dark seems to be the only one where Heyer went for outright comedy. There are chills enough in this tale of five people (husband-and-wife, two siblings, and an aunt) who have moved to what seems to be a haunted house, but there are some extremely funny moments as well. (There is one line in the book--which I will not quote--which sent me rolling on the floor for fully five minutes. You'll know when you reach it.)Enjoy."
2,Definitely not my favorite Heyer...,"This is one of the very few Georgette Heyer novels I hadn't read before, and also one of the two I didn't enjoy. The characters are very generic, the 2 younger women in particular having no particular traits at all. The police have no method, the officer also seems to have no real personality except an occasional feeling of annoyance. The love interest for the unmarried sister is completely inexplicable, odd considering the author's expertise in romance. I like some of Ms. Heyer's other mysteries, love most of her romances, and enjoy mysteries like the Peter Wimseys, older Agatha Christies and Ngaio Marshes, but I definitely do NOT recommend Footsteps in the Dark."
2,Skinless and Boneless For Wusses and Wimps,"There's no doubt that dealing with skinny and boney sardines is not for the faint of heart. Vertebral columns, spinal cords, various and sundry entrails, they're all right there...So here's the alternative - skinless and boneless, promising a civilized, politically correct and appropriate eating experience.Not.These pale pretenders are like throwing out the baby with the bathwater. They're dry and tasteless. Sure they're easy to eat but why would anyone care?And to make matters worse, notwithstanding the fact that the Amazon product description says ""Product of Spain"", these bad boys seemingly slipped across the border by the cover of darkness. Clearly marked on the box is ""Producto de Marruecos"" - Product of Morocco.So don't waste your time with these. Go for the gusto. Vigo skinny and boney sardines come from Spanish territorial waters, and are plump, rich, and flavorful. If you can't handle the gore stick with tuna fish, or perhaps give Pablum a try..."
4,Unique organization makes for a user-friendly guide,"Access guides separate chapters into neighborhoods, making it easy for the visitor or city dweller to access the best restaurants, shops, cultural and historical attractions, etc. in the area where you are at the moment. Although it is more conventional than hip, historical insights and comments from natives makes for a complete Chicago experience."
1,psssst...................hey buddy,"there is a newer edition out there. this one is way out of date and shows how long ""cool"" stuff lasts in the windy city. Better get off of that moneyclip and spring for the newer one."
3,Not the original arrangements!!!,"This is Maurice, but the songs have been re-done so they don't sound like what you remember. I would not have bought this if I had realized this, so just know what you are buying."
1,Open hook,"The earring is different from the one in the picture - it has an open hook, so it is not so safe to wear. The plastic stone is really light in colour, and looks too obviously plastic. It's a pitty as the frame looks really nice."
5,Great Glenn Ford movie,"This is a great drama/thriller with Glenn Ford from the early 50s. This film is filmed in Black&White, Full screen format and runs for about 81mins (1hr 21min). This movie also stars: Diana Lynn, Patricia Medina, Francis L. Sullivan, Sean McClory plus others! Also, I never heard of this movie and that's why I got and I'm glad I did. Overall this is a must have and I would recommend this to anyone adding to their collection."
4,little timmy do u know what emo is,"obviously not. emo is short for emotional. no, you won't find ashlee simpson or maroon 5 under this label who make music to sell. emo is pure. it is expressing yourself. the oc does not entirely listen to emo. i don't beleive the killers are emo or any of the other bands that have played on that show. for those who have read little timmy's misguided perspective of emo, i apologize. this is a really nice mix of songs. buy it, you will enjoy real talent."
3,"Not bad, not great compilation - and a word to the haters","This compliation is ok -some good and bad. I would recommend the Ataris or Anberlin group wise, but they're just my preferences.I see a lot of reviews from people who ""hate Emo"" - kind of funny, I'm not a rap or country fan, but I don't head over to Snoop Dogg or Brad Paisley and slam the genre. I guess I don't have that much time on my hands. I love the Rich White kid comment - I'm not one. Never have watched the OC, and to the guy that says we should listen to Shadows Fall instead.. I'm still laughing, that made my day.Anyway, if you are new to Emo, check out the bands I mentioned - also, some of the ""Punk Goes"" series is pretty decent."
1,blah emo...,"Ah yes emo, the soundtrack to rich white kids in the suburbs who listen to this junk because the new brat pack on the O.C. does. Well personally I hate emo, seriously, like there are very few forms of music I can simply not tolerate, country-rap-pop""punk-emo, that's it. I just can't stand those genres at all they piss me off.To emo listeners: wake up, shut up, and buy a god damn dead kennedy's cd or some other band but leave this emo garbage behind."
4,brother red cd,"the cd was fine but the case was cracked a little , a better packing job could have prevented this , but other than that it was a good deal ."
3,Get this cheaper somewhere/anywhere else.,"I have been looking at this camera case, and everywhere I look it sells for $9.99. It's even $9.99 on the manufacturer's website."
3,Could have been bigger,"Quality of this item was not bad but, item was smaller than expected. This camera case is for the smallest of cameras with no additional space or pockets for cords or memory cards. It is nice looking and very small for easy porability."
4,It really helped my dog!,"I have a 9 year old lab mix, and she is over weight and simply not active. She would breath really heavily even when she was just laying around! I assumed that her not being very active had to do with age, but my vet reccomeded a diet (and i agreed). I looked around at some foods and decided to try avoderm weight control dry kibble. My dog wouldn't eat it at first, so i tried to mix it in with a higher protein kibble (Premium Edge), but she still wouldn't eat it. I topped it with a little bit of avoderm chicken and rice canned to the mix (1/4 can to 3 cups of dry kibble), and she DEVOURED IT! After a month of this diet, my dog lost about 3 pounds, her eyes looked bright and she even started romping around again! I'm SO GLAD I switched to AvoDerm foods!! And so is my Reba!"
1,Forget about this book,Can't understand anything in this book. It's too confusing and the analysis is horrible. Stay away from all Andrew Martin stuff.
3,Better but not the best,"I used to be a big fan but I despised Song From the City....I was ultimately bored with Is This Desire? I had high hopes for this record but it just quite doesn't deliver, she doesn't go over the top with either her voice, or with the emotioanal content like some of the material on Dance Hall, or Rid of Me or the Four Track Demo or even DRY. She does a fantastic cover of Rainer Ptacek on a little EP called Is This My VEil? The same cover is probably more obtainable on INNER FLAME a tribute/benefit to Ptacek. IF PJ has lost the angst in her song writing ablilty maybe she should just do Ptacek covers; he wrote wonderful songs and he's dead."
5,"Everything but a ""Shame""!!!!","If you are looking for something reminescent of old PJ Harvey, here it most definitely is! Rocked out, filled with angst-ridden vocals and lyrics that define what beauty is, ""Uh Huh Her"" is the ultimate labour of love: reanimation for the better, yet a slight stick to the start.PJ Harvey? Uh Huh, Her!"
3,Hmmm...,"Average album by Polly Jean's standards. I would rate Uh Huh Her equal with Is this Desire, which is her weakest album by the way. Up until now PJ has progressed and changed with every record she's made, but it seems she's run out of ideas with this one. She's gone back to the more skeletal arrangements of To Bring you my Love with a few punk rawk numbers thrown in to keep things from getting predictable, but most of it sounds unfinished. Some songs are still worth listening to such as ""Shame"" ""The letter"" and ""The slow Drug"". The main saving grace of this album is PJ's amazing passionate vocals which can make even the musically dullest of songs still listenable."
1,unhhhhhh,"Half baked, lazy, tired, 'phoning it in'. No new ground here. Obviousely out of ideas. Time to look elsewhere for inspiration."
1,lousy,"The music is awful. But you've got to hand it to her for consistency. She's ugly, the music is ugly, and the art is ugly. If you're looking for something intentionally foul to match, even amplify, your black mood - something to lower the human condition generally, you've found it. Harvey's an affront to all, and now with her album in tow, you can be as well."
4,Almost a Great album.,"It took me quite awhile to actually get through this album. But once I did, boy, was it a treat. PJ Harvey can at times be difficult to open up to, to truly listen to. But she always drags you in, in the end. This album takes you back to some of her older material, the only difference being that there seems to be a little more polish than their was on ""Dry"" and ""Rid Of Me"". The most amazing tracks on this record would have to be ""Shame"", ""Cat On The Wall"", ""The Letter"" and ""It's You"". Actually every track except for one is stellar. If it wasn't for ""Who The F**k"", this album would have gotten five stars from me. It's almost as if PJ Harvey is trying to be bad so to speak, by recording this type of track. To me, it does not fall into place with the rest of the track listing. Nonetheless, this is an album well worth your money."
4,She always does this...,"She always comes really close to having a GREAT album, but it almost always falls short. There are some great moments on this album, and I do really like it, but it's kind of disjointed, and it doesn't live up to it's promise. I love her return to a raw, lo-fi type of sound, but the songs just aren't cohesive, and some of them aren't that great. The first 4 tracks are golden, but most of the rest of it really isn't spectacular. It's funny too, because I feel like a lot of the b-sides would have been much better choices than some of the songs that did make the cut. But Polly Jean does her own thing, and that's why we love her."
3,Small but still special,"3 1/2Effective but slightly under-performing concept disc from one of alternative rock's bolder female voices, Harvey nevertheless continues her quality streak with a diverse set of tiny songs touching on the many styles throughout her career. She possesses that rare quality to elevate just about any mediocre composition into emotionally engaging territory."
3,UH HO HUM,"I have all of PJ's albums, and this could be the weakest. I'd been looking forward to her latest for a while, and she took a LONG layoff to produce something this tired. I've listened to it three times now, and it's predictable and uninspired, with most of the songs sounding like half-baked b-sides from the mid-90s. Ok, so it's a ""return to the old sound,"" but it sounds lazy. Say what you want about how ""polished"" and ""produced"" the last one was. But ""Stories From The Sea"" still had some raw moments (""Big Exit"" and ""This is Love"" come to mind) that really kick. With the exception of ""Desperate Kingdom of Love"" and a couple others, ""Uh Huh Her"" is full of a lot of those moments that just never take off. Nothing fierce and exotic to be found here. Will it grow on me? I hope so, and that's why I'll give her three stars instead of the two. She's still better than 90% of everything else that's out there. But I hold Polly Jean to higher standards than that."
4,Take Your Time,"Just like ""Is This Desire"", ""Uh Huh Her"" has a fragmented feel that seems to piece together different people or emotions or what have you. But this record is NOT ""Rid Of Me"" or ""Stories."" It doesn't have the raw hooks and gnarled vocal style. This isn't to say its bad, it's just different. It doesn't sink in first listen, but you have to take time to really listen. The idiot below who panned the album probably listened to it once and wrote his review. Get a life. You need to give this one a few spins and if you like PJ Harvey then you wont be disappointed."
4,A Typical Offering Which Does Not Disappoint,"The opening riffs of 'The Life and Death of Mr. Badmouth' demonstrate PJ's prowess as a songwriter and performer. Wave upon wave on sound build to a cresendo leading to a wall of silence at the end. 'Shame' is one of my favorite tracks. I will not review this album track by track. Suffice it to say that this is a fantastic CD.Longtime fans will not be disappointed. If you are new to PJ's work, this would be a good second purchase. Start with 'To Bring You My Love' or 'Stories From the City, Stories From the Sea.' Either of these is a good place to begin.Buy this CD."
3,Not as good as most PJ,"This album seems a bit scattered, with about half filler and half good material. I think this was done around the same time as Marianne Faithfull's BEFORE THE POISION, which was mostly written by PJ Harvey. She seems to have saved some of her best songs for that album rather than this one."
3,on low flame,"Not quite the intense experience I was expecting (based on some reviews I'd read). I think Harvey is generally at her best when she sounds a bit unhinged (""50 Ft Queenie,"" ""Taut""). ""Who The F___"" comes close, but most of UH HUH HER is a rather subdued affair. This is a decent enough release, just not all that memorable."
2,This sounds like demos and outtakes!,This really sounds uninspired. A turgid march for someone's funeral. If you want to hear a fantastic band with a far superior lead singer then check out Metric.
2,Uh Huh ya.....,This album is too painful to listen to.PJ is out of ideas.Viva some other chick band.
2,what is it with this singer?,"she has such a credible rep, yet i know this isn't the blues. her songwriting is repetitive, overwrought, and follows the same chord progressions as all of her supposedly less talented peers. better than stories but disappointing overall. i can't get over how big a deal critics are making over the fact that she plays all the instruments on this album herself, when there is absolutely no guitar or bass work whatsoever. embarrassing."
2,What Happened To PJ!!!,"This is absolutely the worst follow up album to the wonderfully produced last LP.I just don't understand where she's going with this record.The songs don't have any meaning or real emotion behind them.By the time I was done listening to the record,I basically wished it was never recorded.If you're a fan of ""To Bring You My Love"",""Is This Desire"" and ""Stories From the City,Stories From the Sea"",don't waste your time with this record!!!"
4,"uh huh, ME!","PJ Harveys' songs are coming right out of my mind when she sings. Not as much as Courtney Love who is a true genieous, and what rock and roll is all about. But everything that makes me so mad, also makes PJ Harvey mad too. She understands. Sometimes I don't have to keep listening to her because if PJ really could be me for one day she would want to do other things too besides listening to herself. Which is another reason why YOU should BUY this CD!"
3,I'm not sure.....,"Maybe I have not given this album enough of a chance, but I JUST DON'T GET IT! I am a HUGE fan of music in general, and am totally open to all styles, but this album makes me want to eject it! Is something wrong with my ears ?I give ANY singer-songwriter credit for putting themselves out there, but this doesn't do it for me, sorry :("
3,Dissapointing,"After listening to her previous album ""Stories from the City..."" This sounds like a rehearsal album that lacks out completely of imagination. Every song is made out of one single chord that repeats over and over like a bad record. Try to imagine an ""electro-trance"" music kinda formula. There are a couple of songs to rescue from the album, and there is still that classical PJ's intense feeling on them, but it is shure that there's a huge gap between this and her best material."
5,wow!,"Ok, so I have only gotten to the fourth song, having replayed the first three about 12 times each, but that is enough to make this the best album I have heard since, well, since PJ's last one."
3,"If 2.5 stars were an option, it would have been my choice","Oh, Polly Jean, you set the bar way too high for yourself. After a streak of near-perfect albums (with the possible exception of Is this Desire?), I wasn't ready for something mediocre.I really wanted to love this album. I've lost count of how many times I've listened to it since its release last week, and the majority of it still hasn't grabbed me. While each of her previous albums had a distinct sound, a progression from its predecessor, Uh Huh Her sounds more like an amalgam of every style she's covered since Dry. All the songs are listenable - yes, even the much maligned ""Who the F***?"" - but was an entirely separate track of seagulls calling really necessary? There are a few gems to be found, however, namely ""The Slow Drug"", ""The Letter"", ""Shame"", ""You Come Through"", and ""Pocket Knife."" The remaining songs sound like they'd fare better as b-sides."
4,very soft,"I bought this as a gift for my sister. It came quickly and I had no issues. I thought the applique for the team logo was a little stiff for my taste but, she didnt seem to mind and it might soften up upon washing. I am happy with the purchase."
5,Great product!,I ordered this blanket as a gift for a friend. I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of the blanket. The G is made of Jersey material and embroidered just like a Georgia uniform. It is very soft!
5,"Very soft, great valuew","Bought a couple of these blankets as graduation presents and was a little worried about the quality because they're so inexpensive. But these blankets are good looking, soft, and well-made. And at $19.95, you can't beat the price!"
2,Disney Winnie the Pooh and Friends Wood Bookends,"I bought these bookends for my Aunt for Christmas. They arrived in a cheap box that was crushed on one end. Also, one of the bookends had paint chipped off the bottom so I had to go out to AC Moore to buy paint to fix it myself. Bottom line - these look really cheap and the quality is poor."
5,It's the best,"i have one of these at home and i must say that the spice girls really, really, really worked hard on it. the pictures are nice too. in my opinion, the spice girls really poured out their guts and blood just to make this book so great job girls and GIRL POWER..."
3,"Good, but could be better","(...), there's a lot of stuff from the Resource Kit in here, but as you can download the resource kit from the MS web site (make sure you have a FAST connection), I don't see too much of a problem with that.My problem with it is that there are still commands that are missing and information on each command is a bit sparse. Granted, this is a ""pocket reference"", but I've seen more information in a number of other O'Reilly pocket books, so I know it can be done. Had I looked it over in a store first, I don't think I would have bought it. But since I have it, I do get some use out of it."
4,Handy book to have if you enjoy working at the command-line,"This book has a lot of great information on tools that you can use when working from the command line in Windows. Many of the commands mentioned are actually tools from the Resource Kit, rather than native to Windows 2000, so that was kind of discouraging. On the whole, the book is useful to have, but it would have been nice to have more detail on some of the NET commands and using them in scripts."
3,Good and Bad,"The first item in this book is very interesting and I enjoyed it, but it goes downhill from there. By the time you're finished the last section (about the boats) you're just annoyed because that whole bit seems irrelevant.Also, the photos in the ebook version are pointless. I think I can see what he's talking about in the very first one, but after that, not a clue."
1,As good as an old shoe,I suppose the concept was good but the execution fell short. The leather is so hard I'm unable to use any of the control buttons either side of the control bar in the middle. Might as well have put my Zen in an old shoe. Don't recommend purchase.
3,Works well,It is a bit tight but loosens up after a little stretching. There is some adhesive used in the seams that gets onto the player but I guess that is better than the scratches that would result without the case.
1,Dont buy this item it is garbage,This case doesn't work with the Creative Zen MP3 player. It is so tight it pushes down the buttons on the player so that they are all pressed down together. The leather is very thick which makes the player much thicker then you would want. I would stay away from Eforcity all together they do not allow returns and this product is junk.
4,A very promising and suspenseful debut thriller,"A gripping, fantastic debut from the former X-Files and Twin Peaks script writer. This book is everything a suspense novel ought to be. The characters are wonderful, vivid, and realistic and the mystery is taut and suspenseful and leaves the reader with some serious moral questions at its conclusion. I give this one high, high praise and look forward to reading the author's next novel."
2,Boo!!!,"The reason I rate this book so low is because it started off okay, but then it became boring because the lead character is a wimpy idiot cop and the story started to just drag on and on. I don't know if the author became bored while writing and just decided to ramble on and on.The ending? Terrible and extremely disappointing.Thankfully I got the book at the library and didn't waste money on it."
4,a roller coaster ride from the first few pages,"I'll skip the book description, you can find it elsewhere. So, my reaction as a reader.I was caught up in the first few pages. The characters were people to me almost immediately, and remained so throughout the book. The mother-daughter tension was real (I don't have a daughter, but I am one.)I sometimes had a bit of trouble with the clues, the actions of the characters, especially in the middle of the book.But, when it came down to the last pages, I wanted to read every word, hoping that I could solve...I wished I was there to help.So...I would recommend this book to anyone who likes this genre...and I personally will look forward to the author's next book. Until that comes out, this is an excellent read."
4,From Text to Pew,"A unique contribution by an Old Testament scholar with a pastor's heartwho sincerely believes that the stories in Kings need to be studied aswell as preached because of their contemporary relevance. Readers will appreciate Moore's creative exegesis of the text and the practicalapplication for people living out their faith under pressure. Anextremely valuable book for scholar, pastor and layperson."
5,Perpetual Student,"""Faith Under Pressure"" is a rare combination of scholarly academics and practical advice to those in leadership. Whether you lead in business or ministry, grade school or a university, the lessons gleaned from the Books of 1 & 2 Kings by Dr. Moore will give you new insight on what it means to lead, and how to be faithful under pressure. You don't need a Masters degree to understand this book, but if you have one, you will not be bored. I highly recommend this book."
2,Cyberspace and the Media,"Another interesting view on cyberspace, this takes on the media's impact on this evolving medium. Worth borrowing for most. If you are a public affairs type you might want to even buy it."
5,A great sequel to Passion Bay. Where's the next one?,This book is easy to read and flows well. It proficiently picks up right where Passion Bay left off. I'm anxiously awaiting the next one(s)!!
4,The heat continues,Another great book in the Moon Island series. Jennifer Fulton writes books you can't put down until you reach the end. Can't wait to see what is in store next for Cody and Annabel.
4,Great product improvement,"It is much better than those wooden dowel drying racks. It expands quite nicely. When first received, it felt very sturdy. After a year of use, it is a little wobbly, but nothing like a wooden dowel one would be. Also the top ""lay flat"" area does not extend fully when the product is extended fully. When extended fully, the product is quite large. For this style drying rack, this is the best product on the market. If purchasing today, I would consider a wall mounted or an upright product instead, although I do not know if either product would be an improvement on this great improvement over the wooden dowel drying rack."
5,I love it!,"The best ep of the year! Also a must have is Sharks Keep Moving S/T! Will be in my top 5 this year for sure! No I am not in the band or in Wash. So I have never seen them live, but if they ever come to Salt Lake you can bet I will be up front."
3,Someone in the band MUST have written the above review,"because sharks keep moving never played the song ""Join Up"" live. In fact, the band has not played a show in over a year because they have had so many member changes. As for how this record holds up. Sonically it does not compare to the beauty and endurance of the ""Desert, Strings, and Drifters"" EP which they previously released. But, this record is quite interesting."
3,"Beautiful illustrations, troubling history","This is a beautiful book and very sweet, but one aspect of the story is very troubling. At one point in their history, Sami children were forcibly taken from their families and sent to school where they were punished if they spoke their native language or practiced their beliefs. The book refers to children being hunted down and tied to sleds because they were afraid to go to school. This is a small part of the story, but a sad part of Sami history."
1,This is not the correct sensor as advertised,"Guys,If you are ordering this for a W124.034 or 124.036 mercedes, the sensor wire is WAY too long. The Amazon lookup tool says this is correct for a 1994, 420e. I believe there is another bosch sensor in here which is only $55 with a shorter lead. I shorted the wires.. not so much fun."
5,I Love This Exercise Routine,"This workout is only FIVE MINUTES LONG, but is effective at working the whole body in a gentle and functional way. I love that I can exercise every single day - even on days when I feel bad or am pressed for time. People who are out of shape can begin with the 5 minute, body-only version, but more advanced athletes can add weights for greater resistance, more reps and more circuits for a world class workout.Anyone can stretch it to an hour by adding reps or repeating the circuits over and over - two circuits = 10 minutes; 3 circuits = 15 minutes; 4 circuits = 20 minutes, etc. My athletic daughter uses the 15 minute version as a warm up for her morning run and I use the 5 minute version as a gentle rehab and refreshing morning wake up routine. It is flexible, can easily be tweaked to meet anyone's needs, and is well thought out to be safe and effective.In a world where ineffective, too long, and too hard workout videos are a ""dime a dozen"", this is a real find!"
3,"The condition should have read ""good""","The book arrived in good time but the description of the book should have been listed as ""good"", not ""very good"". Books in very good condition, in my opinion anyway, should actually be in very good condition, not look as worn as this one does."
5,Poignant and delightful,"Catskill Summers is an endearing portrait of a young boy growing up in the 1940's, in particular, the Catskill area where many Jews summered back then. The book, along the same lines as Lake Wobegon Days, conveys an historical picture of an innocent time, as well as the joy of family and the freedom of childhood summers. Buy it for anyone who enjoyed their childhood!Lake Wobegon Days"
4,Note bad shoes,"I would like to say that this shoes is good, comfort, and nice. Regarding the quality it seams perfect. Thanks"
1,disappointed,"People kept telling about these so I bought them. But, I think I bought the wrong brand or something. These DO NOT work!! I'm goingt o just buy the ones at Michael's Craft Store. They're a dollar and actually work!!"
2,Over rated useless bubbles,Useless. Bubbles burst before enough time passes to make them touchable. I am so sorry to have ordered these for my four grandchildren. Expectations were not met. Save your money.
1,Terrible Quality,"Terrible product, the bubbles wont blow, the wand is so small they barely have a chance. Will NEVER purchase this brand AGAIN!"
1,Not Touchable,"My daughter loves the touchable bubbles she plays with in gymnastics so I ordered some to have at home. These are not touchable at all, they pop the second they touch something. I tried standing on top of a table and blowing them high in the air so they would have more ""drying"" time but that didn't work. Extremely unhappy with this purchase! They are just like regular bubbles but regular ones are much cheaper!"
