1,Toxic fillers do not make for a good product,"While everyone here is giving this 5 stars I must say that the OTHER ingredients in this product are potentially harmful. There must be a time-released Magnesium product without all the toxic junk in it. In addition, the calcium is carbonate and is as good as chalk - it is the cheapest and has the worst absorption. Cheap ingredients make for a cheap product!SLOW-MAG is the same thing!Here's the full list of ingredients-- Ingredients: Magnesium chloride, calcium carbonate, dibasic calcium phosphate dihydrate, hypromellose phthalate, microcrystalline cellulose, talc, titanium dioxide, croscarmellose sodium, stearic acid, povidone, triacetin, magnesium stearate, acacia, maltodextrin, hypromellose, shellac, FD&C; blue #2 aluminum lake, mineral oil, propylene glycol.If anyone finds a time-released MgCl without toxic chemicals in it please post it."

2,water volley ball,The net is too weak. It broke very soon after we got it and I cann't find a replacement.The sides are also weak.
1,CCGJBG,THIS TOY IS NOT DURABLE AT ALL. THE NET BROKE IN ONE DAY AND WE NEVER EVEN PLAYED WITH IT. THE WEIGHTS THAT COME WITH IT GOT A HOLE IN IT IN ONE DAY ALSO. THIS WAS A WASTE FOF MONEY. WE NEVER EVEN GOT TO PLAY WITH IT. DONT WAIST YOUR TIME OR MONEY! LOOK ELSEWHERE!
1,Waste of Good Looking Women,"This film is so bad, I know it was supposed to be a sexy spoof, but they barely showed any nudity and very little sex. And the sex they showed was awful, come on Europe, I thought you knew sex!!!"
4,XP remake of old titles is fun but not as good as the original,If you had any of the three games in the pack on Windows 95/98 it was better than these. The games play just as well but a lot of things are missing in the set up as well as there is no instructions packed with them. There may be instructions on the disk but because I already have them I didn't need instructions. But in any case these great games are now playable on Windows XP and were not before.
3,Sub command is ok,"I must have spent a couple hundred hours on sub command before getting bored. Thus, it is worth the price. I found the other two games uninteresting."
2,Needs extensive patience and the manual needs to be a thick as the yellow pages to offer adequate help.,Needs extensive patience and the manual needs to be a thick as the yellow pages to offer adequate help. The learning curve is immense.
2,sim games,the navel combat pack game run is too flat for my tastes graphics are not up to what i though they would be
2,Doesn't work well with windows 7,very cumbersome to play.. controls are hard to use and windows 7 doesn't like to run it. wouldn't recommend to anyone
3,My opinion,well rounded games with moderate difficulty and good accuracy as far as time period assets. Game is fun and I enjoy it a lot
1,Hard to fathom,"I have played the tutorials a few times, but this game is a lot more about planning and figuring than about action game play. I was expecting to blow ships out of the water, not to learn about plotting intercept coordinates or assigning tracking vectors.Really bummed. Wish I could get my money back."
5,Lens Cap,I have used lens covers similar to this in the past and like them because they are attached and you don't need to worry about losing them. I am happy with this lens cap and the service was prompt and good.
3,OK,Screws onto end of tube adapter so must be taken off for widest angle pics. Other than that inconvenience it is fine but overpriced with shipping charges added in.
3,"Good idea, bad execution...","I was really excited about this product. It sounds like a great idea: a quickly-removable lens cap that won't get lost.The problem is that the fast cap's diameter is much larger than the lens filter, so it sticks out well past the barrel of the lens. This makes it unable to fit in my lens bag and much more likely to be accidentally torn off the lens violently by getting caught on something.If they would just make the cap the same size as the lens it's supposed to protect, this would be the ideal lens cap. Until then, however, I'm going to stick with the original cap."
1,"Pretentious, Obsure, and Obnoxious","I absolutely agree with the other one star reviews. This book is way overhyped and overrated. Some interesting passages and a good character or two but the rest is very tedious, etc, etc. The author does have a good way with words but no sense of story telling."
3,dated,"If I hadn't read The Egyptologist (which I thoroughly enjoyed) first, I wouldn't have gotten very far into this novel. But I knew from my first experience that Phillips is a slow starter, so I kept going. Unfortunately, for me this book never did really get going, and reading it 10 years after publication and 20 years after its historical setting, I found it quite dated. And I don't find the writing good enough to help it transcend its being categorized as a topical novel."
2,Disappointing Read,"I bought Prague because of several extremely favorable reviews I had read and because of the subject matter (I'm an expat living in Bangkok). Yes, I finished it, but it was a struggle. Some parts were truly entertaining and engrossing, especially the life story of the Hungarian publisher. However, I never figured out what the critics saw in the novel and my main reason for finishing the book was to try to discover what I was missing, a task which did not end successfully for me. The book simply went nowhere and the ending left me believing that either the critics were wrong or I was inadequate to the task. With all the great books to choose from, I now wonder why I didn't just close this one after the first few chapters. It never got any better."
1,Why Oh Why Did I Finish It?,"Who are these ""literary critics"" that seduce us into reading dull books like this one? As I plodded on, one dull page after another, each one well- but thoroughly-overwritten, I looked for some interesting plot development, some fascinating character, some hilarious dialogue, that would justify what those literary critics were saying. No such luck. What I found in all those pages was a group of uninteresting, unlikeable, aimless, hungover expats wasting time in Budapest (some law should have prohibited this book from using the title Prague). As my wife said after my second round complaining, why don't you just put it down? That's my advice to you."
1,Falls Flat,"A promising first page, then the disrespect takes over. I use ""disrespect"" because it's clear the author doesn't think much of his readers. We spend our hard-earned money on this book, and this is what he gives us? Snarky phrases, sentences with all style and no substance, and some sort of post-modern plot that's so boring it actually made me long for a pulp novel.I won't give this book anything other than 1 star, because even though it's a debut, and even though writing a book is hard, and even though, even though...The author is a professional writer. As a reader I expect more. Stop trying to show off and give us something we can sink our teeth into."
2,One of few books I was bored enough with to quit reading,"After more than a third, it seemed we were still in character development and nothing happened. Mind-numbed boredom overcame me and I gave up. About as enjoyable as someone's home movies."
1,Vastly Over-rated,"Here's a case of PR triumphing over content. It's a debut, he's young and photogenic, and the critics go into rhapsodies. Yet the book is 100 pp. too long, and its focus is off. The only truly interesting people are the minor characters, the Hungarians. The Americans are boring and empty. Yes, that may be the point, but writing a boring and empty book about such types is, well, boring. And did I mention empty?"
2,Disappointment,"I have to say that even though this book at times made me chuckle or sit back and think; it did not inspire, entertain, or on any level feel as if it was a great book.The novel fails on many levels to actually have a story line. You do become fascinated at times with the character development but you are left at the end saying ""so what"". The novel soon becomes almost tedious to read. The saving grace is Phillip's ability to make a few lines or thoughts stand out to keep you reading."
1,Are you kidding me?,"Since I enjoy reading just about any genre, I was surprised how much I hated this book. It did not seem to have a clear beginning nor an ending. It was confusing all the way through...jumping between characters and time spans sporadically, even dumping a character with never a clear explanation. Nothing in this book is clear. I think the author enjoys hearing himself talk in as many out of circulation words as possible, which only muddled up the flow or lack thereof in his writing. He should stick to game shows or manuals or something. Novels...no. Who was his editor????? Wow."
3,Magyar Melrose place,"This book starts out great. Phillips really has a handle on Hungary in general and after-the-fall Budapest in particular. (I say this as a Clevelander with hungarian blood, who is married to a Transylvanian Magyar, who visited Budapest in 1990, who went to grad school with the author's brother (I think)....). The characters are compelling and well developed. BUT, about halfway through the book it becomes ""all about sex,"" and this goofy publishing house takeover deal. I was waiting for Heather Locklear to get off a MALEV flight from LA to kick some serious butt."
3,PRAGUE,"PRAGUEBY ARTHUR PHILLIPS--------------------------------------------------------REVIEWED BY JOHN M. EDWARDS--------------------------------------------------------Now here is a book called ""PRAGUE,"" which really is about Budapest.Need we say any more?--John M. EdwardsBIO: John M. Edwards is an award-winning ""stringer."""
2,Like Chalk Pastry,"The book provides a number of colourful descriptions of the city that was also my domicile for 4 years. However, such attractive appearances, like many things in Budapest (the pastry, the cuisine, the storefronts, the women, the building facades), are really just masks over deficiencies of substance within."
1,Prague? Does this guy know where he's at?,"This book was an utter waste of time. For once I regretted my mother's upbringing of finishing what I started. I bought this book because of it's stellar reviews and because of it's cover, thinking I'd get a good read about my beloved Prague. I was shocked to find that despite chapter headings to the contrary the entire book takes place in Budapest with characters one couldn't care less about, who are into drinking, sex and sordid art.Budapest being as beautiful as it is and being called the Venice of the East one should think the author could have found more beautiful and interesting things to write about.I thought about selling this book used so it wouldn't waste valuable space on our bookshelves, but I can't do that to my poor fellow human beings... Even 1* is too much - it should have been a total 0!"
1,No No No!,"This book was dreadful! I hate to not finish a book, so I continued to work my way through it wondering when it was going to end and put me out of my misery."
1,Couldn't finish it,"This was the first book I did not even feel compelled to finish. I purchased it for vacation reading and hoped to enjoy it, but did not. I did give it a fair shot, however, the story seemed to be conceived and delivered in a fog; the language seemed labored. I can't imagine this was a pleasure to write---it certainly was a painful read."
2,Falls Apart Halfway through,"While the first part of Prague consists ofa series of delightful, wonderfully writtenvignettes and observations about expat life, goingback and forth between its small group of centralcharacters, the novel falls apart once itintroduces -- or, more to the point, *forces* upon thenarrative -- a superficial plot relatingto the aquiring of a Hungarian publishing house.Perhaps the author was worried that simply followingthese characters around through their own lives andletting their own actions determine plot wouldn't be""meaningful,"" or interesting enough.In any case, the result is that much of the material afterthis plot is introduces feels rather contrived.Nevertheless, I'd recommend this book if you don't mindstopping in the middle of it, or trudging through an unengaging last half.Hopefully, Phillips' next book will pay-off on the intialpromise of this one."
1,Prague by Arthur Phillips,"Although the old world ""flavor"" of this book is wonderfully executed, I have to be honest. I find that after nearly two weeks of trying to work my way through it (and work it is!) I still could care less about the characters, and even find that as I work through each page I have a difficult time even remembering who they are and how they relate to each other. Although their names are common, they slip away within moments of putting the book down after another terribly trying and boring chapter. I find that I just don't care what is going to happen to any of them enough to even remember that basic character fact. As far as I'm concerned, this one is a no-brainer. Don't Bother, and I'd check out any future novels by Arthur Phillips from the library first to see if he improves any before buying."
2,What happened to Story?,"Keeping in mind this is a debut novel, I kept trudging through it, looking for some reason for all the glowing reviews.I didn't find much, besides look-at-me prose and characters with interesting names. Plot? Conflict? Reason to turn to the next page? Couldn't find those.I can't give this one star because completing any novel is difficult, and it isn't Mr. Phillip's fault that all these ""professional"" reviewers pulled our legs. He's trying to make money and he's surrounded himself with enough ""yes"" people to let such drivel pass unprotested.But he should keep in mind Hemingway's advice that a writer needs to have an excellent ""bullsh*t detector"" because his book reeks of it."
1,What were they thinking?,"My book club picked this book over 2 months ago to read. It has taken me the entire 2 months to wade through it! We picked this on the 'stunning' reviews, and I am still having a hard time figuring out what the point of the book was. We start off with a group of characters, and it dwindles down to a few that are so strange I can't, and don't want to, keep up with them.None of us liked the book, and I doubt I would read any other's by this author."
1,Disasterous!,"Character names aside, I see no similarities between the editorial reviews and the book I read. There is nothing 'sparkling', 'flavorful', or 'wonderful' about this ill-thought, poorly written work.I don't recommend it, but if you absolutely must read this book, save yourself $$$ and wait for the paperback."
1,"Horrid, Just Horrid","I second what so many others have written. Hard to understand where any good reviews came from. While reading the first chapter, I was keenly reminded of the conversations that used to take place around the cafe tables at my Ivy League school. Everyone was so full of themselves and so sure that at age 20 (or 21 or 22) they knew simply EVERYTHING and were so much more wise and important than any other humans to come before or since. Turning to the book jacket, I saw the author was a young man out of Harvard and that explained the book's tone.Although I always finish books, I closed this one without a bookmark and am quite sure I will have no urge to open it ever again. Trash heap for this."
2,First half was wonderful,"The first half was so wonderful, I almost recommend reading the book and stopping at the end of Part II. This first section is beautifully written and the characters are well developed.However, the second half reads like trashy novel. I'm not a prude but I also don't like to waste my time reading a ""novel"" where the characters are obsessed with sex and have no other aspects to their life. By the end there were no reedeming qualities left to any of the characters and you don't care what happens to any of them. The second half was even more insulting & disappointing after such a wonderful first half."
3,One dark little novel....,"I actually enjoyed Prague but I would've liked it a lot more if it hadn't been hyped as a light-hearted romp through expatriate life. You can't blame the author for that but believe me, this is a pretty dark book. Really, from what happens to the characters, you'd have to think that living in Budapest was about as psychologically damaging as serving in Vietnam.On the other hand, if you're looking for a black comedy, you could do worse. I liked Phillips' writing (I found it leisurely, you might find it glacial) and as a American living abroad, I found his insights spot on. Sometimes, you just can't change yourself by changing the scenery. And really, while the Lost Generation were legendary boozers, isn't there a bit more to expat life than endless drinking games?Anyway, I thought it was pretty good book. Just be warned it's a bit different from how it's been sold."
1,What were they thinking?,"Like many readers, I bought the book because of the great reviews, and because I love Prague. I can get over the fact that the book is set almost exclusively in Budapest. Budapest is great city also. But the reviewers see something that I just don't see in this book. I hate to be repetitious, but the characters are really NOT likeable. They are whiney, self indulgent and shallow. The main character (John) is also an alcoholic. The book doesn't have much of a plot, so I'm assuming the author wrote it as a character piece. Life is too short for me to spend this many pages on characters I don't like. I am one of those people who always finished books, but this one is torture. Maybe I could lose it!"
4,"Writing is excellent, story, mediocre.","Fabulous book.The plot itself is acceptable, and a slightly lagging storyline is revived near the conclusion with some strange and ambiguous twists.The real beauty behind this work is Phillips' tremendous command of the english language. Superlative use of metaphors and choosing the right words(with the right connotations) is his specialty. You'll find yourself reading passages over and over, just to re-experience some of his masterful articulations.Definitely worth the investment of 400 pages of your time."
2,And why is the title of this book Prague?,"Three out of five bookclub members agree: ""This book made me want to stop reading and drop out of bookclub."" This writer has potential, but this book is a real drag..."
2,awash in adverbs,"I want to read this book, I even want to like it. After two chapters I am so drowning in a multitude of adverbs and awkward phrasing (""a young man who recently asserted quarter seriously that he..."", p. 8) that I don't know if I can or will finish it.Still trying, giving 2 stars for ambition, taking away 3 for the obvious lack of a good editor. Hope to scan the whole thing if I can. Dropping the adverbs alone might cut the book length by a hundred pages... and sell more copies."
3,"Good, But Far from Great","There is something to this book, but not as much as the glowing reviews suggest. The pace is slow, the characters eventually real and the atmosphere very strong. But there is something missing here also. I think it is purpose. At the end I didn't care much about the people and I don't know that I should have. I even think the author may have intended me not to care. He is an interesting writer but I belive that th reason one reviewer feels that he has read 50 books by him already is that it is often derivative. Chabon is in here (but comparisons with Chabon are way overdone). There is even some Graham Swift in here. But those are two authors who always make you care or give you comething to care about. Without that I just don't see the point of this book."
1,Zzzzzz.....,"This book was terrible. After the first chapter, I kept picking it up, skipping pages, trying to find something I could grab onto that would hold my interest. There was nothing. A disappointment!"
1,December to May still an incomplete read,"I am a real book chewer. I never ever read the end first and I ALWAYS finish them...well almost. This book just didn't hold my focus. I tried; I truly did. I read all the ""respected"" reviewers and I wanted to give it a real shot. When I found myself looking often at my ""home"" to see if there was a new blog or kindle note, I knew this book wasn't capturing my fancy. I've been trying to complete this book since December and now it's May.I loved the historical bits but the characters were not interesting enough to push through to see what happens to them. Even now, as I am sure I am not going to finish the book, I don't care enough to glance at the back to see what occured.This one is so bad I am deleting it from my ""Manage My Kindle""."
2,B as in Boring...,"What a profound disappointment this book turned out to be! After waiting months for this book to finally be available at the library, I find myself endeavoring to pore through a narrative of dreary tedium....sad to say, this is one I will not finish....or should I say, can not finish because of its soporific effects."
2,Subtitle: the power of slick marketing,"I confess I did not finish this book. I read to about page 80 or so and was so bored with it I put it down. I tried to figure out why I bought it in the first place, and have concluded the novel's 'buzz' is more an attribute the authors marketing skills then any literary merit.I was always curious if a generation of anglo american writers would emerge out of the expatriot communities in prague and budhepest (which is where this novel takes place, in spite of its title), and so far the answer is no.Some would say it's not fair to enter a review having partially read it. Fair enough, I can't judge it past page 80, but in my opinion if you can't grab a reader's interest in 80 pages, you're not a good writer.Maybe Books are like 'friends' some people make friends with some people others find dull. Perhaps this is the case with this book.If you are looking for something in the same genre, catlin macy's rules of play wasn't bad."
1,Not really about Prague,I found this a long read and not worth the trouble. The author Phillips has promise. I'd wait for the next one.
1,BORING!,"We selected this book for my book group, which includes a diverse group of women and men. We were all very disappointed by this novel. We found it overwritten, boring, and pretentious. Also, there's no real story here; it seems more like a writing exercise than a novel. We read some great books in our group. Forget PRAGUE. Check out the following--all strong books with a central story, careful writing, and complex characterization--DISGRACE, by J. M. Coetzee; LIFE OF PI, by Yann Martel; MIDDLESEX, by Jeffrey Euginedes."
2,The Long and Winding Novel,"I finished this book and shortly after found an online reading group with the author. It was interesting to see his perspective and that of others, but I was left feeling as though I didn't read the same book as the one they were discussing. Several of the participants had ""ex-pat"" stories of their own and maybe it was my perspective that was lacking. I join another reviewer in suggesting the temptation to skip over paragraph after paragraph of seemingly endless and unnecessary detail to somehow wrestle a plot from the pages of this novel. At one point I felt like I might finally be on board, when the author decides to temporarily drop the story and begin a new thread. Overall, I felt that this novel was more work than fun for me, but I'm glad to hear that others liked it."
3,"If you can't find your opportunity in Budapest, you won't find it in Prague either.","I was looking forward to reading this book, but have to agree with several other reviewers: at times it is very slow, and if you don't have time to read for a week, it is very difficult to get back and try to remember what you read before. Not an easy read, that's for sure. I am glad I read this book, but this is not something I would want to read again - it's a lot of work to go through the hundreds of pages, and et the end only remember one character. This could have been done in a shorter format, with less ""suffering"", but maybe that was the point..."
4,Beautifully written,"This novel's verbal artistry- the choice and arrangement of simple words- is amazingly beautiful and effective. Each and every sentence is a joy to read. Also extraordinary is the author's insight into character and personality. His only ""problem"" is the distance below surface reality where much of the action occurs. This dream-like subjective world beneath the objective hand-to mouth existence is intriguingly painted by wondrous strokes of the pen.The story line sometimes blurs in this schizophrenic borderland { three star plot related by five-plus star narrative}. Nevertheless the wonderful words keep coming, drawing the reader on for more. I greatly anticipate this creative, gifted artist's next work."
3,Disappointing,"I bought this book based on the reviews, with high expectations. However I was disappointed; it was dull and dry. He maybe had a good story in hand but it could have been made better. Wait for the paperback."
2,"all frosting, no cake","Why is it that so many prominent reviewers are so utterly unable to distinguish the facile from the real, and endlessly mistake the decorative for the good? Prague is clever, arch, self-aware, eurudite, sometimes witty, and often well-written. It is also precious, mannered, false, cliched, and tedious. Phillips watches himself oh-so-knowingly transpose the lost generation into the modern world, winking all the way, and it's too clever by half. Good books actually step up to the plate, take real emotional risks, and don't apologize for it."
2,"Great short stories, not a full novel..","""Prague"" has some excellent writing, with interesting characterization in spurts. The jazz pianist and her stories, for example would make for a nice short story. The characters are funny, smart and interesting in bursts, especially John Price, but the writing is uneven. The author seemed to be trying too hard to be an intellectual ""expat"" in the '90's on the level of Hemingway or others from the 1920's literary generation, but the writing in ""Prague"" isn't even close to that level. Sure the book is funny, creative and is at times loaded with sex like a mass market paperback, but the book lacks strong literary content. It was flat-out boring during the dry spells!"
1,"CAN YOU SAY, OVERHYPED???","This is one of the most whiney, overrated and overhyped books in years. The characters are completely unlikeable and the story is barely interesting. Don't waste your time on this poorly written ..novel."
3,Prague's a bit plodding,"Eh, that's the overwhelming feeling Prague left me. It's ok. It plods a bit, but the characters are interesting. The characters are so good, you kind of wish they had more to do, more life in them. But not so. I'd suggest reading this if you were at the bottom of the reading pile."
2,waste of time,"It took me a year to read this book and I am 50 pages shy of finishing it and still not understand why it's called Prague when the action is in Budapest. At times it was the description of the city (Budapest) that kept me turning the pages, especially that I visited Prague and Budapest long time ago and the book brought back nice memories. Other than this and occasional wonderful and witty phrases, the action gets boring, the characters got mixed up in my head (especially after pauses in reading), everything is so lax...."
3,false advertising,"Having visited Prague last summer, I wanted to read a novel set in that beautiful city. The only part of the story that actually takes place in Prague was the last paragraph or two. What a disappointment!!"
2,"Flat, two-dimensional characters=flat, two-dimensional novel","A good friend of mine recommended Prague and, given that recommendation and the many excellent reviews, I very much looked forwarded to reading this book. I was very much disappointed.While the book began promising enough, in the end, I found it difficult to muster enough enthusiasm to finish this novel. I wasn't interested enough in any of the characters to find out what was to become of them. While the author clearly intends many of the characters to be extremely well-developed, three-dimensional personalities, they are all, including the protagonist, flat, two-dimensional characters whose actions make little to no sense. I don't care that the characters are ""mean"" (hell, Seinfeld is one of my favorite) shows; I do, however, care that I don't understand why the characters are mean."
2,Yawn,"Tired. That's how this book made me feel. Fortunately, I loved Phillips's other book, The Egyptologist.Expats - this is no longer the 1990's. Who cares about spoiled westerners living abroad now, anyway?"
3,Almost there...,"Although I think that Arthur Phillips will be one the young writers to watch in the coming years, I can't quite settle on a solid opinion of his first novel. Although I thought his style was beautiful, except for his overuse of the parenthesis. The characters were well developed, and his method of introducing them was unique. Overall, I enjoyed the read, and I will look forward to reading Phillips' work in the future."
2,Unfortunate waste of a significant talent.........,"Arthur Phillips can write. There are times as one reads Prague that one is nearly overwhelmed by Phillip's linguistic skill and descriptive capabilities. Unfortunately, this is such an unbalanced effort that the net effect of this realization is overwhelming frustration.The frustration in this novel is that while Phillips has an uncanny ability, through elegant prose, to skillfully evoke the sense of time and place that Budapest was in the immediate post-wall-collapse period, he juxtaposes this elegance against torpid, caricaturist characters devoid of any depth, intelligence, likeability or interest whatsoever. The end result is a multidimensional novel as to time and place populated by one-dimensional characters devoid of any connection to that time and place.Phillips has rare talent. One can only hope he will eventually put it to much better use in subsequent efforts than he did with Prague."
2,"rather disappointing, despite the glowing reviews","I read all the wonderful reviews about this book, and was eager to hungerly devour it during a recent wide-open weekend. The book's pace began with great promise, and I eagerly lost myself in the personalities different characters who seemed to have great potential. But about halfway through the book, the pace stalled to nearly a complete halt. The same characters who appeared to have such dimension ceased to evolve and now seemed silly and shallow. And when the author introduced a new character and his background, the book's narrative flow was disrupted in such a way that I never did get back into the story. Disappointing."
1,Over-hyped,"This is the kind of ""must-read"" book BR Myers skewers in A Readers Manifesto, made worse by it being a debut novel by a young handsome author, which makes reviewers turn cartwheels.Sure, there are beautiful images and sentences here, but so what? It was choked by its own irony, by its ironic stance about its irony. The only interesting characters were the minor ones.The rest were boring. And yes, I know they're meant to be boring and pretentious, but that might work in a story or novella; in a novel of this length it just became tiresome."
3,Sloging Through Prague,"With its singularly uninteresting group of characters, this novel, although it is well-written in places, is a dreary slog through a splendid city."
1,Show Don't Tell,"The author lack ability to paint a picture of people, though he does O.K. with inanimate objects. Soooo much ""telling"" us what the characters were thinking. I prefer books where we come to our own conclusions, rather than get the spoon-fed Gerbers in this book. Pretentious. Self-conscious. No confidence. Unwilling to trust the reader."
1,Not worth buying,"This book doesn't offer much that you can't find in Outlook's Help system, it's poorly organized, and it isn't written well. You can almost hear the sleepy author's fingers clattering on the keyboard as he hurries to meet his deadline and get this book finished. Whether readers can understand a word didn't rank high on the author's priority list. Nothing is explained well. Nowhere does he give you any advice about how to make Outlook easier to use.Don't bother with this hastily written book. It's hard to read and it isn't worth the asking price."
3,lots of info,Lots of information but not what I had expected or hoped for. Having an issue with Outlook on one of my machines and thought this would provide the fix information.
1,"Should Be Titled ""How To Do SOME Things...""","I agree with one of the previous reviewers. This is a book for people who already know previous versions of Outlook and only want to know what has changed. There are some basic functions (like out of office auto reply) that are not even mentioned in the book. This book will NOT tell you 'how to do everything with Outlook'. It will only tell you 'how to do SOME of the new things in the 2003 version of Outlook'. If you want to learn about Outlook for the first time and be productive in your office from a PRACTICAL applications perspective, then this book is NOT for you. I have found the HELP feature in Outlook to be more useful than this book."
3,Not Exactly as Described,"NOtice in the product description where it states: ""2-Piece set measures 12-1/4-inch in diameter"", that is the INSIDE measurement. I ordered these because I have a convection oven that will accepts pans that are up to 13"" in diameter. THese won't fit because where the handles flair out, they are 14"". The product description should have also included the outside diameter of 14"". I wish I had seen the other reviewer's complaint about this before I ordered them, but I only read the first few that popped up and missed that one.However, these are nice non-stick pans for my large oven and they have a good weight - not flimsy at all, so I kept them. They work great for pizzas, cookies and small snacks. They fit in the dishwasher and aren't showing any signs of rust after several dish washes.I docked them 2 stars because I like to know exactly what I'm ordering BEFORE I order it and this product failed that."
2,The non-stick worked until it didn't,"After purchasing these pans earlier in 2011 I posted two photos but did not rush to review the product because I wanted to see how it performed over time. The non-stick coating worked for 4 months and then my pizzas started getting wrecked; half-stuck to the pan and so on. I took care of the surface too; only used a plastic spatula, cleaned and dried them by hand, the whole works. I make pizza about once a week and since there are two pans I effectively rotated them. So even if I was being generous and said each pan got used 3 times a month, that'd mean each was used roughly a dozen times before the non-stick ceased working. Now I'm spraying the pans before each use with a no-stick spray and have no troubles with the pizzas releasing cleanly from the pan. But it was the non-stick feature I bought these pizza pans for so I can't say I'm satisfied."
5,product review,"Love it. Very good quality, long wearing product. Great price too. Urban decay shadows are the best. I highly recommend this product."
4,novice,"The camera seemed o.k. couple little issues with condition, but no manual. I am a novice slr user, and am lost as to how to use this thing. Asked seller to send manual, but still haven't heard. Will have to buy one for $10.00. Oh well. mike"
3,Simply Amazing!,"The first camera I got had an autofocus problem, thus my bad ratings and concerns. As a result, I've purchased a Nikon D50 instead. However, everything's changed when my friend bought the E-500. Much to my surprise, the camera did focus properly and was a real pleasure to use. However, he has been a Nikon 35mm camera shooter for a long time and he accumulated quite a bit of lenses. He also loved the E-500 but realized that buying yet another set of lenses was not viable.So, we simply exchanged our cameras:)The E-500 is very well built and is packed with tons of features. From dust-reduction technology to incredible colors. Yes, the Nikon D50 focuses faster and performs better in low-light and in high ISO, but once you get used to these shortcomings, you end up with an all-around camera.I love the big LCD and all the tweaks you can do (white balance, RAW+JPG...)"
1,Do not buy this camera. Could not focus.,"Had this camera for a few years. Always felt pictures were not very sharp. I though It might be problem of my naked eyes. Unitill recently, I happened to take pictures on some prints, and pictures came out so blury it could not be read(I was using a tripod). I switched to a Sony camera, which is not as fancy as this one, and the result was 1000 times better. Wow, what a disappoint."
2,"There's better out there, and cheaper.","The E-500 is my first DSLR. I have owned it for about two years. Overall, the camera is not too bad for what it is, but you need deep pockets for any upgrades. Also, the kit lenses are soft (fuzzy). Later, you will find out that the ""high grade"" upgrade lens are soft, too. This camera is about the same level as the Canon Xti. If you have ever dreamt about learning professional photography, go with Canon or Nikon and forget about this camera."
1,Worst Camera I have ever used.,I'm a film major so ive worked with a few cameras - this is by far the worst one I have been forced to touch. I bought it at a discount brand new and have been disappointed every time I use it. It won't let you do what you want and if you tinker with any settings it automatically lowers the shutter speed making everything incredibly blurry and wont let you change it. If you shut the flash off the pictures arent even visible and if you put it on auto it takes about 3 minutes for the camera to finally stop auto-focusing and by then the picture is usually gone. There is no option for manual focus which makes this camera completely useless for the price. DO NOT BUY.
1,Dont use a compact flash card with the evolt 500,"I bought this camera two months ago, and had no problems with it until I went to put the Compact flash card in one day, and I got an error message from the camera stating a card error. I then went out and bought an xd card and tried to put that in the second slot that this camera has. same story. I have sent this camera back to Olympus, who are now telling me that a tiny pin was bent when putting in the compact flash, and they will NOT cover this under warranty, and they want 250.00 to fix it. They have yet to explain to me why the xd card does not work either. So the bottom line is beware putting a compact flash in your camera because if it bends one pin, your 800.00 investment is now useless, and OLYMPUS WILL NOT HONOR THIER OWN WARRANTY, or even entertain the fact that they made a defective unit. I can now no longer use any of my compact flash cards with this unit for fear of a 250.00 hit everytime I dare to put one in. THANKS A LOT OYLYMPUS>"
5,Got more than expected,"I needed a backup camera body for my existing system because I am going to be a photographer for a group of about 100 people going on a cruise. I placed the order with some concern. Would the pre-owned product operate properly and arrive on time (or at all)? As soon as the body arrived I compared all its functions to my existing camera body. I now have them both organized identically, so that I can switch between camera bodies instantly and not miss a beat. The camera delivers as expected. In addition, there were some extras: The body came with storage media and an OEM battery, something I didn't expect. In addition, it came with an OEM battery charger! That was a pleasant surprise. I would trust this seller for any future purchases."
1,Don't buy this camera,"I have been using SLR cameras for 30 years and have had a digital camera since they came out on the market, most will last at least 5 years. This thing began to break a week after I got it. The second time I removed the compact flash card two of the pins came with it which rendered the slot useless, fortunately the XD slot was still functioning. One week after the waranty expired the thing stopped working completely.The pictures were ok but nothing to brag about, my little Casio Exilim takes much better pictures than the Olympus ever took in any mode and it only cost $ 150 that was $ 500 less than the Olympus.Get a Fuji S700 or a sony DSC H5 they give professional results and require no expensive special batteries or cards. Both offer manual and automatic settings which work great and are simple to use for the beginner or the professional and both are under $ 250."
1,compact flash pins,Olympus will not honor their warranty if you bend a pin inside the camera body. Mine bent with normal use within 6 months. That my friends will cost you $ 250!!!!!What a bunch of bull from what I thought was a reputable company. Shame on you Olympus!
2,"Oouch, It's not Canon or Nikon so I can't say much.","I bought E500 as birthday Gift for my brother , hoping he will love this camera. I am not sure what features he did not like, but he told me to get him Real DSRL like Canon or Nikon and return this one.He complained about shutter speed, startup time and also lack many many things which he loved in other cameras but I did what he wanted to do and got him Canon Rebel XT , which made him much happier.I am guessing it is still a good camera, but may not be upto real DSLR grade as Canon or Nikon are."
5,YOU GOT IT THIS TIME OLYMPUS!,"I have been a long time Olympus Fan! Back in early March 05 I purchased one of the first EVOLT E300's, WHAT A MISTAKE!!!! I hated that SLR! It replaced my C8080 Widezoom. I then purchased the NEW CANON DIGITAL REBEX XT, AWSOME!!!! What an investment that turned out to be. Purchased many options and after all said and done I invested nearly $3000.00. Don't get me wrong I received a lot of punch for what I purchased, EFs 10-22m Lens, EF-s 17-85mm IS Lens, EF 75-300mm Lens, 580EX Speedlite Flash ECT ECT ECT, Got it with the Kit Lens also,....I love all of it! But now I gave Olympus another try,I purchased the EVOLT E500 and it KICKS THE REBEL XT's BUTT! I can't give enough PRAISE to Olympus for the product they have put out here. The EVOLT E500 gives more than what you deserve for the purchase price of UNDER $900.00 at most places for the kit that includes both lens! You won't be disappointed in this set up AWSOME!!!!!"
4,review of olympus e 500,a fine camera. the only thing wrong with it is a bad bettery door. this needs to be redisgned. otherwise 5 sTARS.
5,It will capture the beauty of the world around you.,"I have photographed from earthly little creatures to amazing bodies of heavenly magnitude (see the ladybug and the moon photograph in the ""share your costumer images"" file, for example) and I can't help the thought that this is what art-photography is all about! I am no pro. I have no photography background. All I have is just a strong desire to capture the beauty of the world around me and my Olympus Evolt E500 does the job perfectly. Try it! You will be delighted."
5,Great SLR Camera,"This camera is great value, I bought it with the two lens package. The normal lens is good and the zoom lens is huge. I bought a 133X speed 4GB flash card for the pictures and I've taken some amazing shots. The sports mode is great for skiing and captures very fast movement. The focusing is a little more elaborate and so takes a bit of getting used to if you're coming from a compact digital camera. Highly recommended"
5,Graduated to SLR,"Have been a fan of Olympus cameras since the film days with my 30 years old clamshell 35mm still operable. Have been using C-750 and C-8080 (great optics, steep leaning curve). The E500 optics are almost as good as the 8080,however, much more user friendly. Controls are handy and intuitive. Outstanding feature. NO MORE SHUTTER LAG! Overall quality first class. Only minus is the small viewfinder, hard to see settings off to the side wearing glasses."
4,"an excellent camera, but with long-term issues","I bought a slightly used (display model) Olympus E-500 2.5 years ago and have been extremely happy with the results. The battery life continues to be excellent even after constant use (almost daily for 2.5 years). The picture quality is excellent, even with flash in low light (but not very low light) conditions.HOWEVER, this camera is starting to have small focusing problems (feels like sometimes it doesn't want to take the photo) and a red line now appears on all low-light photos. I would reccomend this camera whole heartedly to anyone, but be aware that it will not last as long as you would like. I would think that for the price I would get at least 4-5 years out of it. My last Olympus was bought in 2002 and still works well."
4,Quality Olympus cameras and accessories,"Having never owned an Olympus camera before I was a little unsure of the quality compared to other high named brands. I found that it was just the same quality without the expense of paying for the so called ""Name Brands"" which you are paying for the name not the quality of the product. I would recommend to anyone who enjoys the many photographic nececities that you get on those expensive brands, that Olympus has just as many features to produce excellant pictures."
5,Great Starter Camera!,"OK, so I'm not a professional photographer (not for lack of desire or talent, mind you!). I'm actually very much the novice when it comes to camera equipment, but I'm learning. I've had one form of camera or another since the age of 7, though, and I know what I like.I got my Evolt 500 kit from my husband, Christmas 2007. This is my first GOOD camera and I'm wondering how I ever got along without it! I love the image quality I'm getting. I love the ease of use. I love the feel of it and, as I saw someone else write, the very satisfying sound of the shutter-click!I realize I still have much to learn about cameras and all of the bells and whistles that go with them, but I would absolutely recommend this camera to other beginning, aspiring photographers. I'm having a blast with it! By all means, this baby gets Five-plus stars from me."
4,The happiness of last year's model,"At the time I bought this camera, it was at the end of its product life. The E-510 had just come out and was selling for more than a $300 premium over the E-500. Yes, the E-510 has a better pixel count and image stabilization. But I just couldn't pass up the relative bargain of the E-500. It's a very satisfying camera. Very good picture quality, good lenses, decent manual (considering the complexity of digital SLRs, a good manual is a necessity) and light weight.My one complaint is the lack of a usable remote trigger. I have the infrared remote and it's really only useful for taking pictures of yourself as it must be aimed at the lens side of the camera. I like to take shots of birds at my bird feeder using a tripod and this remote is useless for this purpose."
1,Don't waste your money!,"We own all of the other Baby Einstein cards but these are terrible! We were so very disapointed with the quality of the pictures on these cards that if we could have returned them we would have. The other cards sets are a great quality, this set of cards is simply a plug for other Baby Einstein products. Please think twice before purchasing these."
1,Baby Einstein: Numbers and Shapes Discovery Cards,"I would not recommend these cards. They are too abstract and very confusing for young children. Some cards you do not even know whether you are reviewing colors, shapes or numbers. If I had seen them before I would never have purchased them!"
3,Great Cards- Printing is Upside Down,I have purchased two other sets of the Baby Einstein flash cards and this is the first set where the writing on the back is upside down. It is very disappointing because the cards are on high quality stock and are very vibrant. These cards could have easily been a 5 star rating but either the company cut the QA person or s/he was gone the day the proofs went out.
3,Got this as a gift for my niece,The case is a bit squished but the cards are fine. I think this was supposed to come with a CD but not included in what I got.
2,"Good for a snack, I guess","I've bought several of these cards for my baby son, and I've ended up throwing them all away. You want to get a good start making your baby smart and all, but all he's wanted to do with them is bend them, tear them, and when he's hankering for a snack, eat them. By the time they're out of that stage when they want to destroy and put everything in their mouths, it's on to bigger and better things than these simplistic cards. Would recommend board books instead."
3,OK...,My daughter loves them...She loves the feel and the animals but I wish it was more than 1-10...They really should go up to 20 at least.
2,Mixed bag of music,"Bought this CD because I heard the Johnny Appleseed suite on the classical station and loved it. The first three tracks are really awfully discordant although the virtuosity of the violin playing has to be admired. I have to skip over these tracks to get to the rest of the CD which is lovely. It is not the kind of CD you would play while reading a book and having a cup of tea. I really wonder to whom the first three tracks appeal? Sounds more like an unplanned and unrehearsed violin jam session, well, with very accomplished musicians."
4,Good start of solid food for baby,"I have just started to give my baby solid food and used this cereal as suggested by almost every ped. I love this cereal because it provides nutrition for my baby and my baby loves this one because of the flavor and texture. The only thing I don't like is that the producer does not include spoon inside the box to measure, but you can measure by tbs or teaspoon yourself."
3,Gerber baby cereal,"It seemed to ship okay, the packaging was nice and concealed, however some of the baby cereal spilled out in the packaging."
1,The package are all broken!,"The package are all broken!Powder is out everywhere,the only thing I can do is throw them to the garbage can. I was very disappoint !"
4,baby products,This was a decent buy. Shipment too a 1.5 to 2 weeks. I had to wait a little while longer than usual but it was okay.
4,Very good compilation,"This is a very intense compilation of the facts, and circumstances of one unbelievably cruel dictatorship, and the conditions that helped perpetuate it. As a Dominican born after the Trujillo's Era, I'm very glad and thankful that someone (in this case Mr. Bernard Diederich) having been in such a prominent position (Reporter in the Caribbean during the Trujillo's regime), decided to put together all the information that he had access to. This book is an amazing source of information for those who wonder why such a cruel dictatorship lasted so long, and why so many atrocities went unpunished until after the death of the dictator."
5,These songs are truly enjoyable,"It's true. Just as everyone else notes, it's not the parrothead variety of music. But it is truly a collection of Jimmy Buffett to be treasured. What you will hear on this CD is something that so much of today's music just doesn't offer. You'll know what I mean when you hear it."
4,Early Stuff that shows Jimmy's Roots,"A must have for the Parrothead that enjoys Jimmy's Nashville sound. Easy to tell Jimmy had not been influenced by Key West yet. Sounds very Jerry Jeff Walker, or David Allen Coe like. (Both of those singers also went to Key West and changed music styles). This CD is a change up for any Parrothead Party or for a lazy weekend."
5,Before the Beach CD Review,"Many people don't know that these cuts were released on an album called ""Before the Salt."" This is a pivotal album for Buffett as it was the one he made just before going to Key West, Florida with Jerry Jeff Walker.His music style decidedly changed during and after Key West. So Before the beach provides us some classic Buffett to listen to. My favorite on the Album is Death Valley Lives. While Ellis Dee represents social commentary on the poor. Quite the dichotamy in songs.In any case this is a great album and a ""must have"" for any true Parrot Head worth his/her salt. : )"
5,WOW What a CD,If you had 2 things to do in life one would be to hang out with The Hang Out Gang and the other would be to set Ellis Dee free cause they are great songs. This is my favorite Buffett CD i have heard. Get it now or you aren't a true fan
3,Exercise Ball blues,Dont really use it much.......i guess I didnt realize. It is kind of scary if you have any injuries.....you dont feel secure.......but it works I suppose......difficult to store....unless you deflate.
4,Small but not tiny...,"I am around 5'5 and I think the ball is supposed to be right for my size, but it does feel a bit small. I can't really lay on it to do my back arch stretch, and I think I might get a bigger one. But over all, I like its quality. The foot pump took a long time to pump the ball, but once pumped it looks nice."
4,Fun and thought provoking book of questions,"How Far Will You Go? is a fun and thought provoking book filled with up to 500 questions that can be used to learn more about ourselves, our family and our friends. These questions help the reader explore the world around them and remember the weirdest, greatest, scariest and funniest moments of their lives.Some of my personal favorite questions are ""What's the furthest you've ever pushed yourself physically?"" ""What is the wildest thing you've ever done in public?"" and ""What is the biggest lie you've ever told?"""
3,Great Ice Breaker!,"I got this book to use during our lunch breaks at work, and school. The things I learned about myself and my co-workers lol"
2,Disappointing,"The title of this book is misleading. I expected the book to be about hypotethetical situations where the major question would be ""how far will you go?"" Unfortunately the book is a bunch of random questions, most of them uninteresting, but several of them thought-provoking. It's good for a laugh but don't expect to have any deep conversations over this thing. I got it as a present but I wouldn't spend any money on it."
4,Do You Hold Any Boundaries?,"Part of the ""If"" series of question books this one will test your boundaries. Filled with questions to contemplate and perfect for open discussions with friends and lovers. Be prepared for insight into someone's moral fiber, including exposing your own!"
4,Excellent book for company.,"I really enjoy this book for it's ability to start group conversations around more than the latest movie you saw or plans for next week.This book has tons of very different, thought provoking questions varying in depth, but really can stimulate good conversations, or simply getting to know people better. Generally testing the limits of morality, and personal views of what boudries can and can't be crossed, it makes for interesting discussion, and you will often find yourself getting way off track as your conversations take surprising turns from the original questions.A terrific end table book, because it's impossible for guests not to pick it up and start asking away."
5,Great Conversation Starter,"I bought this book for a friend for Christmas. As soon as she opened it, we started reading and answering the questions. Questions like, ""Who is the person you miss most right now?"" ""What would you most readily die for?"" or ""In what way are you least understood?"" Not only will it tell you alot about who you are talking to, but it will also make you dig deep within yourself for the best possible answer, and end up telling you alot about yourself. She is planning on using this book at our New Years Eve party and I know that it will be a hit. If you want a good conversation starter, a new party idea, or you just want to get to know more about your friends (or yourself) you should buy this book. It may be small in size, but it's contents can be powerful."
2,Not as far...,"This book has some interesting questions. Not as good as I thought it would be but some of the questions are very thought provoking while others are just strange. Bought two, gave one as a gift. The recipient didn't like the questions much either."
5,Very informative and interesting...,"The presenter tries very hard not to be a pretentious snob but is clearly comfortable in the world she presents. This DVD is very informative. Although I was specifically interested in French antiques, I found the section on silver and porcelain surprisingly interesting."
3,Antiques intro DVD,"Although quite intersting due to subject of antiques, foundthe ""host"" rather monotous in tone and enthusiasm.Repetitivealso in some places.Would prefer to buy ""The antiques roadshow"" if available.Millie"
5,Excellent Music,"I bouht this cd yesterday.I have to say that I had never heard about Micro,but he's simply amazing.My favorite tracks are numbers 2,9,10 and 11.Great music that will make you go crazy."
2,ok but not the old micro,"thats about it, hes just went away from the old stuff, of breaks and acid tracks to this, this is for the trance heads that like radio club hits"
2,How do you define good music?,How do you define good music? Is it old music. Is it about doing the same thing over and over again. No...It's about ground breaking beats that stay good over time.This CD does not hold up. I admit it is exciting if you turn it up really loud. But then again isn't almost all dance music? The only thing I see on this CD is that it is live. The crowd almost make the cheesy buildups and clubby acid lines worth listening to. Being a music producer myself I can say this is not worth spending [money] on. ... Save your money and buy the new GU release nothing bad comes out of there. The CD reminds me too much of Louie Devito's N.Y.C. Underground Series.Sorry for disagreeing.RespectVentilator
5,Micro is simply amazing!,"First off I would like to say this is the first review I have ever written.(Mainly beacuse of laziness)But I felt this dics was soooo amazing that I had to write something about it. I own all 6(someone correct me if there are more)of Micro's discs.And this one is by far the best. Don't get me wrong I love all of Micro's others but even they have some slow parts, but not this one. It doesn't matter if your chillin, kicking it, or dancing like there is no tomorrow. I think the most important quality of Micro's is his paitence, he really makes you wait for the huge explosions. The last song on the CD is awsome and it's his. If you ever have the chance to see him live don't miss it, he will completly control the ENTIRE crowd.(It's really amazing) If you are a Micro fan I'm sure you already own this CD, But if you don't what are you waiting for. Yes I'm talking to you. Yes you! I hope everybody enjoyed this cd as much as I did."
5,One of the best Poirot Movies yet.,"This is a fine example of David Suchet and Hugh Frasier at their very best. High drama and poignant, touching moments. The only thing missing is an appearance by Ms. Lemon and Inspector Japp.This episode contains some of the best acting of the entire series. As compelling as my other favorite epsiode - The Chocolate Box.If you like David Suchet as Poirot - get this video!"
3,Here and There,"TELL ME WHY is an odd LP, containing some of the best music Wynnona has recorded--some of the best Pop or Country music of the last 20 years, for that matter--side by side with some of the silliest junk this side of Flock of Seagulls or ""Disco Duck.""How do you explain an album that would sandwich a song as flat-out stupid as ""Let's Make A Baby King"" between two masterpieces, ""Only Love"" and the wrenching ""Is It Over Yet""?How did producer Tony Brown justify recording a tacky novelty record, ""Girls With Guitars,"" on the same tape with a gem like ""I Just Drove By""?Wynonna's voice is, as always, powerful and perfect. She is the best singer country has seen since Patsy Cline, bar none."
1,Amazon's customer service,You provided the product as promised and on time. The reason you get a horrible review is because Amazon is horrible. Thier customer service rots. I ordered items direct from them that reached me weeks past the due date and they won't respond to me requests to return them. I get the same form letter garbage every time I try to contact them. Amazon is crooked. Maybe they'll find time to reply if I keep embarrassing them enough times.
5,Oldie but.....,"This release by Wynonna is a 1990's recording, but I still like it. Particularly her rendition of ONLY LOVE which has interesting lyrics and wonderful chord changes.Nice to revisit this album and some memories which go with it."
1,CONTAINS FLAX!,"I never expected granola to contain flax seed -- something I'm allergic to. I sat down to a nice bowl of granola, and it sure tasted good! Then my throat started to itch. Then my stomach started to cramp. I stopped eating and checked the label -- sure enough, near the bottom, 'ground flax seed'. My husband, who is not much of a granola eater, tried some a few days later, and although he isn't allergic to flax, he found it still made his mouth and throat itch. If you're not allergic to flax, by all means enjoy it, but if you are -- DON'T TOUCH IT!"
5,"Delicious, healthy start to my day!","I've been eating Bear Naked Fruit & Nut Granola for a couple of months now & I'm totally hooked on it!I mix it with vanilla soy yogurt & fresh seasonal fruit (currently blueberries and fresh pineapple). Delicious!I just received a case of 6 pouches via Amazon & I opened the first pouch this am & immediately noticed more fruits and nuts in these than the individual pouches that I was buying at Whole Foods (at almost double the cost!) I don't know why, but I'm very happy about it as more nuts and fruits = happy me!My new am routine is certainly more nutritious ( and lower in sugar) than my former daily breakfast, which consisted of homemade cocoa (using unsweetened, european cocoa powder), almond milk (hardly any protein), agave & a marshmellow, along with a (zero nutrition) gluten-free cookie!"
5,WOW,"This is awesome granola! I have it with frozen blueberries and plain yogurt my wife makes. She used to make her own granola, but she has a new bar to get over now!"
1,Company ingredients not worthy,I purchased a Bear Naked chocolate / peanut butter granola cereal first part of last year 2009. The PeanutButter recall came out. I asked the Bear Naked company if this cereal was involved in the recall. They said noit was not. I still did not open the cereal. Then 3 weeks later I actually found it on the recall list. Then theylisted it on their site. I inquired again and asked for a refund. Sent several emails and received no response.They do not back their own products. They were apparently using crappy peanuts in there own cereal and did not even know the source of the peanuts. Can't trust them on any of there items. I never got a refund. This company cannot be trusted. Stay away.
5,Best Granola Cereal!,This is the best granola cereal that I have ever tried. I first found it at Sam's Club in 20 oz. bags but they do not stock my local store any longer. Many may think this is pricey but well worth it. Now I routinely schedule this for delivery and get a little more discount. I mix it with a pumpkin seed flax cereal and eat it with blueberries and banana. Wow! Its nice to look forward to when you wake up. Buy it! You will not be sorry.
1,Piece of Wood Found in the Granola,"I am a big fan of the original fruit and nut Bear Naked, but for a change of pace I bought a package of the Banana Nut. Near the bottom of the bag I was dismayed to find a two inch piece of wood. How can something like this happen? I find something like this totally disgusting."
5,yumminess!,so good - i love bear naked. i think the fruit and nut is the best out of their varieties.
2,Wrong item,I ordered fruit and nut gronila but received three berry instead. Unfortunately I had it sent to a friend who was unaware of the mistake and was unable to return by the time I got the item.
1,IS NOT ORGANIC AND CONTAINS GMOS,"I loved this granola until I realized it is falsely described here as organic. It is not organic, contains no organic ingredients and further contains genetically modified ingredients (GMOS). I will be sure to search out truly organic granola from this site and hope that has not been falsely advertised as well."
3,The inside of the bag smells like plastic.,"The first thing I noticed when opening the bag was the chemical stench of plastic fumes.The second thing I noticed was the lack of vitamins and minerals contained in the product.Despite these two flaws, I was at least somewhat satisfied with the product -- its only saving grace being that it tasted OK."
4,Good product,"I got one at the venue of my fist half-marathon. The product overall claims to be very nutritious and natural. I admit that it mostly stands true to its claim and, more importantly, whole grain oats are fairly chewable and like that fact that it retains its natural texture too. As other reviewer has pointed out, taste is very well balanced, neither too sweet nor too bland. It comes with nice ziplock bag with all those printed claims that gives impression as if its a sole survivor of past 'age of raw food' and boasts of not having ingredients that any unprocessed food should not have. Neverthless, it keeps granola fresh. May not be able to convince GMO-free community since label has no mention of it (I am sure these guys would put it in billboard fonts if it were ;D)."
3,"Great Granola, Not fresh from Amazon","This granola is really good, but the stuff from Amazon is not fresh. The whole bag is a solid brick of granola when you receive it. It is pretty stale. I've gotten it several times, and my experience has been consistent."
5,Good enough to start eating breakfast again!,"This stuff is awesome. A great-tasting mix of all-natural granola, WHOLE almonds & walnuts, and banana chips that make breakfast the best meal of my day! I'm not a huge banana fan, but the flavor here is perfect: the bananas don't overpower the nuts and vice-versa. What I like the most is that every mouthful is a little different, depending on the mix of banana, granola, and nuts you happen to get. Great with milk or as a snack. Even though the bag looks small in comparison with the boxes of cereal on the grocer's shelf, you get nearly the same amount of stuff, and the quality is 1000% better than any other granola on the market (just compare the list of ingredients and you'll see what I'm talking about.) Highly recommended, also try the Apple Cinnamon and Fruit & Nut varieties."
1,Ugh!!!,"I don't have much to say but that Sutherland sounds abominable in this performance. She is just too old! Acting is terrible, voice is terrible....that's 0 out of 2, and sutherland is in the title role! Skip this one, it's not worth it one bit."
2,"The Merry Widow, a flop","Sorry, The Merry Widow is a delightsome Operetta, but Joan Sutherland is past her prime for such a part. Her singing starts out wavering and slightly off key. She is too old and too big to carry off the dances. Ronald Stevens did a good job, but could not carry Joan Sutherland. (no pun intended) We will just have to wait for a newer singer, better suited for this Operetta. Help, will someone produce a bubbly good Merry Widow."
5,A hook for the diva ???????,"There certainly are a lot of warts on this Australian production, and to blame them all on Joan Southerland is, I think misguided..... I mean even the editorial review is less than flattering to the aging diva ... meeoww meowww ... little plate of milk for, on the floor though, the ed reviewers .....This is one of the very very few DVD's of this opera and that is what makes it enjoyable, to be able to at least see in in your home. The dance numbers are exquisite and as a whole the lighting and video are excellent....If there is a down on this DVD well I am disgusted that it was only cut in two channel Dolby ... what ... 2 channels ... I didn't even know there was a dvd available in 2 channel stereo ... WOW what a bummer ...As a die hard audiophile I couldn't take it and left the room ... but my wife and all her friends who are card carrying, season ticket opera NUTS ... all enjoyed the DVD ... go figure ...."
1,I made myself watch it and cringed the entire time...,Sutherland really should have opted out and done herself -- and this production -- a favor. I simply couldn't get into it (and this is my favorite opera!) because she was just too huge and horsey. The dashing Danillo seemed almost frail in her presence.Do yourself a favor: skip this one.
3,Six Little Angels...,"This is by far the best Terri Jo song to date. If her newest works continue to meet this higher level of superlative songwriting, the sky will be the limit for her professional aspiritions."
2,A disappointment,"The legendary Anne Murray doing standards. The idea seemed great - until I heard the album. What a disappointment! For me, at least, the twangy counntry-western arrangements of these jazz-inflected sophisticated standards just don't work.Though the Murray voice is mostly still intact, and very nice to listen to, she sounds to me as if she is just singing through the lyrics with little feeling or interpretation."
4,raw!,"This is a great live showcase, and also the rawness of artist back then on the uptown label.Standout's are jodeci, chistopher williams and Mary.A timeless piece of R&B; in the New Jack Swing Era."
2,Re-think,"The specs look great on paper. It did work well for the first month. Now it does not work. The seller was not very helpful and refereed me to the manufacturer. Even though the product has a 1yr guarantee, they want customers to pay shipping both ways and allow up to 8 weeks for the return. Not acceptable!"
5,Can't sit Down,"I bought this video for my grandchildren, ages 2 1/2 and 16 months (my daughter had warned me....no more videos Mom, they have enough..but I did it anyway). The music never stops nor do the little ones, they love it. I just sit there and laugh till it hurts, watching them do their own imitations of the movements being performed by the Wiggles.I have to admit though, I even get up and join in the fun...I love it too."
5,A Great Video,"I (and my son) like this video as much as ""Yummy Yummy"". The last couple of songs don't hold his attention as much because they are more dancing instead of singing and interaction but it is still a great addition to our Wiggles library."
5,Toot Toot! Lots of fun!!,"My son loves this DVD and all the songs. He had a hearing problem when he was about 22 months old that we didn't find out about until he was around 26 months old. Suffice to say, he lost a lot of valuable learning time and it caused him to be very behind, especially in his speech. We began working with a speech therapist, reading books, playing games, everything you can imagine to help him catch up with our main focus on his speech. I knew that he loved music so I got him this video. It was a big hit and he was singing parts of songs before I knew it! The DVD is so fun and we would dance together and laugh as we watched it. The music is great too! My son is now three and still loves the Wiggles, especially this DVD. His speech has improved so much, praise GOD! Would highly recommend this DVD to anyone but it's especially great for kids that love music and want to have fun!"
4,Happy Grandaughter,"I love the Wiggles...and so does my 2 year old grandaughter. She loves the DVD, because she likes to dance and sing along with them. It keeps her busy for a while, so I can get a few things done while I baby-sit."
4,Almost a 5 star!,"It is a good one. But since newer stuff has come out that IS a tad better because the new ones are song after song after song and this one has breaks in the singing as the Wiggles go over a storyline about their big red car having broken down---so sometimes DD loses a little interest. But, of the older Wiggles DVD's this is by far the best."
4,Wiggly fun,"My 17 m/o daughter is a big Wiggles fan. I am too. We have this tape and ""Wiggle time."" We love them both, but prefer ""Wiggle time"" simply because there is more time spent on the songs. I strongly recommend them."
5,Great for Kids!,"I'm a mother of four children ages 8,6, 22 months, and 12 months. Let's just say that they can keep you busy if they choose to do so. Well, I know it's not PC to use TV as a babysitter but who am I to complain when my precious children are held in rapt attention for over an hour? They sing. They dance. They giggle. My kids LOVE the Wiggles! They love the bright colors and the personality of each Wiggle as well as the engaging tunes. I highly recommend this video to anyone with children ages 8 to 1 year."
1,DVD won't play,The DVD wouldn't play as it has a different Regional Code. Wish I had known that before I opened the pack as now cannot return it.
2,Bad quality,I didn't like the quality of the movie and it did not hold my child's attention because of that. It looks like it was made in someone's basement. None of the songs are any good either.
2,"Love the Wiggles, but don't like this video","We have a 2-1/2 year old that absolutely adores the Wiggles. She has already learned alot about the world through previous videos (I think her first words were quack quack).We bought this video based upon other customer recommendations but were disappointed in the quality of the production. Whereas in previous videos (eg WiggleTime) there were plenty of painted sets this video is almost entirely bluescreened. The songs that aren't bluescreened are all in front of the exact same set which is basically a wherehouse painted three shades of green. At least I think it's green, its hard to tell because the colors are alot less vivid. Jeff's shirt looks grey and Anthony's shirt looks green. (and it's not the fault of our TV or VCR)It also seems like there are alot more songs without words.After viewing this video, my copy is for sale."
5,"We love to dance to ""Toot Toot""","My kids love the songs on this video. We like to refer to our Wiggles videos as Kiddie Aerobics because of all of the dancing our toddler and preschooler do while the video is playing. The songs are well written, catchy and best of all are meant to teach kids things they need to know."
3,Cute video. Poor quality.,"This video itself was cute, but it's so blurry that we don't ever watch it. We have other Wiggles videos that are better quality (Yummy Yummy, Wiggly, Wiggly World!, Wiggly Safari, Wiggle Bay, Racing to the Rainbow). Save your money and eyesight on this one and buy one of the other ones."
2,Some funny stuff before we lost interest,"This video started out great! The sounds and the guys had my 21-mo. olds full attention. But, by about the 11th song he was up and wandering the house in search of other things to do. The majority of the songs are unheard of in the US and it was hard for me to keep him interested when I didn't even know what they were singing. Brightly colored video and some pretty funny sounds but if I could go back I would have bought something else."
1,More annoying than Barney and Elmo combined,"I bought this video for my 18 month old daughter. She has no interest in it and even seems frightened by some of the ""creatures"". I personally cannot stand it and won't put it in, and I am someone who can stomach Barney and find Elmo slightly charming. The costumed characters are irritating and bizarre, the music is annoying and the Wiggles are nothing special. I would never buy another Wiggles video or CD based on my experience with this one."
2,Mesquite Grille,"not as good as I expected from Mrs. Dash's products. I uses a lots of Mrs. Dash dry seasoning and they are fine, that's why I am a little disappointed with this product."
1,stupid,the book was really boribg didnt help ypu alonfg to find the answers...overall a waste of money
3,too expensive!,"At over $30, do you think I could get photos in color? (I know at least one photo is supposed to be color because the caption refers to color variation.) Old book, and it costs too much! Lower the price or put in the realphotos, not b&w; scans!"
5,Great for my stylus,"Like the other reviewer, I also bought this to improve the conductivity of my JotPro. Adonit oughta ship a little packet of it with their stylus and replacement tips. It eliminated all the problems I was having with the stylus."
2,Sirius SIR1-JVC cuts out every day,I gave up after a few months.Had it connected to a JVC KD-R900The unit was cutting out several times a day due to loss of satellite signal.The unit froze up and I had to cut power to it 3 times.I found the satellite signal level was always low compared to my XM unit.I put a XM adapter in it's place and since then not one loss of signal for the last 4 months.Programming is much better on XM if you like sports.Recommendation: Don't waste your money on this unit.
5,An Amazing Book,"This is an amazing book; it is relevant well beyond the sociology of religion or the sociology of sexuality. Moon offers a compelling exploration of how communities debate contentious issues while attempting to hold the group together, pointing to how Christians use talk of feelings (particularly pain) to be able to discuss the issue of homosexuality in their churches. She also offers a fantastic examination of how people understand practices different than their own, pointing to the use of similes (homosexuality is like alcoholism or homosexuality is like race) and how the use of similes implies certain actions (if you see homosexuality as like alcoholism, you will try to treat it; if you see it as like race, you are more likely to accept it).Moon writes in an accessible tone, peppers her book with interesting quotes from her interviews and participant observation, and makes compelling arguments on every page. A must read!"
2,Hard to close and difficult to get wire inside...,"I was very disappointed in this product. It is extremely difficult to get the wire inside of it. And it's virtually impossible to snap shut.Though it's easy to cut and the adhesive backing adheres strongly to baseboards and/or walls, I really expected the ""snap open and shut"" to mean there was an actual hinge on the cover, which there isn't.Don't be fooled by that ""hinged"" claim. What is called a hinge is really just two interlocking grooves on one end that really don't come together except by sheer force. So there is absolutely no way to conveniently open/close the cover as the product specs claim."
1,Miss-represented product,"The description says that this item is 1.08 inches x 1.50 inches x 36 inches. In another area of the listing it says 1.1 x 1.5 x 36 inches. When they arrived I didn't even open them, and could not believe what size they really are. I measured them with calipers through the plastic bag they came in and found that they are .49"" x .51"" and didn't bother to measure the length since they were so drastically different from what was posted and also from what I needed for my job that it didn't matter. Now the job I had scheduled for Saturday is postponed until the Panduit Pan-Way LD-10's arrive. This has been a disappointing waist of my time and an inconvenience to my customer which could have been avoided with proper and accurate description of this product"
4,Good results -- but requires some effort,"I used this product to hide wires over drywall, wood trim, and marble walls. I got good results overall, but it took some effort. For most surfaces, I had to remove adhesive that came with product and replace it with permanent 3M VHB double-sided tape, which is much stronger. Product can be cut fast & accurately using PVC pipe cutter (the kind with blade, available at any hardware store). Some bends & corners with unusual angles may need to be mitered for a clean look.In some places I had to caulk around wireguide to achieve a gapless fit. Then there's the work of painting wireguide to match wall/trim: a snap if you have the right paint, otherwise expect some trial & error to find a good color match.Overall a worthwhile product, but expect to put some time & effort into installation."
3,did what I wanted it to do.,"I purchased this to hide a TV cable that ran along the bottom edge of a sliding door-wall in our family room. The cables used to be afixed to the door frame with tacked cable holders, but these kept poping out of the wood frame, and the cable would become a hazard to anyone trying to walk out the door. It also was unsightly. This product so far has stayed in place and keeps the cable in a nice clean straight line - no more ugly trip hazard. A TV coaxial cable is at the uppermost diameter limit for this kit - anything thicker, or multile wires wont fit."
2,Not what I expected,This item works great if you only have one cord that you want to hide if you have more that one its almost impossible. I tried hiding 2 cat 5 cables and it was very difficult I did manage with only cutting my finger once on the very taunt plastic.
1,Yuck. Can put one lamp cord in it.,"Wasted my money. Even a tight fit for one slender cord. If you have one cord you want to put I to it then go for it,"
2,Difficult to open and close,The title says it. Very hard plastic without a hinge is very hard to open and even harder to close. I've decided to leave mine in the box and try another brand instead.
1,Incorrect specifications.,"The specifications say this item is OVER 1"" x 1"". The wire channel would actually be able to handle one coax or HDMI cable, and a couple of small gauge speaker wires at the very most. It is small, the interior diameter is smaller than my pinkie finger. Product returned."
3,Use Only With Small Diameter Cables!,The opening is only wide enough for tiny cables (speaker wire) and cannot hide even the thinnest HDMI cable. The C210 model is a better buy.
3,Works Fine for what it is,"As other reviews have pointed out this is not as large as described. I fit two speaker wires for surround sound speakers into the Cordmate and it works fine. But there is no more room and I can't actually close the channel. So, if that is the size you need this will work great, but if you are looking for larger diameter you will be disappointed."
3,Not large enough to hold speaker and hdmi wires,"Small inner diameter. This product may work well for a telephone wire, but not much more. I would recommed going to Home Depot to see which size wiremold kit you need before guessing and buying online."
5,very good,"this product is ok to hold only one wire/cable, if you intent to run to cables in it do not waste your time and money with this product. I am using it to run speaker cables from my receiver to the speaker, it holds very well. It is easy to cut and install. Recommended"
5,Good product for the price,I purchased this set after making a earlier purchase of the same thing at double the price at best buy. I find it very easy to use and it serves its purpose of hiding wires correctly. I used the first set in my den to hide the TV cable in and out of the corner then up over my gas fireplace where my 42 inch flat screen is mounted. Then I had another TV project for a spare bedroom so I purchased this product from amazon (same thing as best buy has) I used the product again and it looks great. I am not back to purchase another set (or 2) to use in my bonus room where I am mounting my 46 inch flat screen. The classy look of 1 wire or 5 wires out of view is well worth the price for one of these kits.
3,"Diffcult to work with, but right size for the job","I mostly second everyone else's feedback. I bought it to run cables from a wall-mounted LCD TV in my bedroom to the floor outlet. Since I only rent, I couldn't install a power outlet behind the TV and needed something somewhat subtle. 1) The tube only holds two cords max (on cable, one power cord). I had to apply a LOT of pressure to get it to close. Also, it still had a few areas where it bulged open 1 mm or so. Fortunately, I had put the seam facing the side that you can't see from the room. 2) The adhesive is bonds to the wall. From what I can tell, I will have to peel off some drywall to get it removed when I move out. There goes some of my security deposit!Still, it does what I need -- and I'm happy with it."
3,Need to widen the tunnel,The organizer is great and does the job it was created for. My only wish is the diameter of the organizer was a little larger so that I could squeeze my speaker wires with the TV cable.
5,What an adventure!,"I've never before read a 'travel' book and eventually picked this one up and couldn't put it down...even after I had finished reading it! Maria kept an honest and immaculate diary of their journey around the world in a collapsible, double kayak. Their courage is commendable as is their sense of adventure. Excellent recounting of a treasured journey."
1,Very fuzzy,This product looks great but the mirrors are so bad that the design is very fuzzy and you are unable to focus the image. The music box part is fine.
2,Cute Idea but . . .,"I ordered this because I love both kaleidoscopes and music boxes.The music box is all right, playing 4 bars of ""Over the Rainbow.""As far as the kaleidoscope part goes, the images are not very bright, probably because the music box is at the end, and not enough light comes through the sides. I also did not like the movement of the parts. The pieces fall into place with a jolt instead of moving gracefully. But the biggest fault I found is the quality of the mirrors. Whereas in most kaleidoscopes I have seen the mirrors are so smooth they are practically invisible, in this one the edges are so rough that they detract from the pictures.However, the combination of music box and kaleidoscope is quite a cute idea, it is certainly unique in my collection."
3,Old Fashioned Toy,"BOught three kaleidoscopes for my grandchildren; one, six years old; one, three years old; and one, 2 years old. The oldest was the only one who really could operate it successfully. The others will understand how it works as they get older."
5,She loved it!,"She loved it! On time, as described. What more is there to say? I don't like the rule that lots of words must be added."
5,Another Yoga Zone Gem,"I've had several Yoga Zone DVDs in my collection for some time. I love the 20-minute practice format, esp on busy weekdays when I simply cannot get to an evening class. I've done both PM programs several times; they are challenging, but not so difficult that you can't do both, if time allows. Recently, I opted for the first ""Sunrise"" practice (there are two of each) as an alternate to Rodney Yee/Patricia Walden AM/PM Yoga. As I get older, I definitely notice a tendency to have a stiff back in the morning, and these practices work wonders. They are gentle enough for the morning, but also energizing, a great start to the day. The evening practices contain lots of hip openers etc, which are great after a long day of sitting at a desk. As always, YZ instructors are thorough and engaging. Will make a nice addition to your yoga DVD collection."
3,Not for True Beginners,"I've practiced yoga for five years, and enjoyed this video. However, I wouldn't recommend it for anyone who is just beginning, working on an injury, or attached to slow, intraspective practice. The instruction is fast-paced, and the basics of posture, balance and alignment are not well-explained."
1,disappointed,"I have a lot of yoga dvds and this is by far my least favorite. Not at all what I expected it to be. Don't see how they think one is for morning and one is for evening. I think the morning is a time when you should work gently on flexibility cause you are stiff. This dvd doesn't really work on flexibility at all. The dvd is like an aerobic workout that uses yoga poses. If you are doing yoga for exercise alone this might be good for you. That is not what yoga is about for me. If you want a good one, try the Gaiam AM and PM yoga with Rodney Yee and Patricia Walden."
1,A DVD to Forget,"This collection of the ""Great events of the 20th century"" is a collection of public domain footage, set to public domain music, with NO NARRATION. Yes, it's silent. Occasionally random information appears at the bottom of the screen and there is an introduction of sorts to compelling segments like The Grace Kelly story.How someone expects you to pay for their experiment in bad editing with no narrative is beyond me. Shame on you Madacy ""entertainment."""
3,Quilting Masterclass,The book was not exactly what I thought it was. Could have been more instructive.
5,Enjoyed,Ordered these Cadfael to continue the series. Which we enjoy watching Pass them on to relatives who can't wait to see.
4,Very good follow-up album,"DJ Heather's previous CD, ""Tangerine,"" really set the standard for how a mix CD should be made. ""Dancefloor Principles"" is no different. The song choices are diverse, but still enjoyable. The tempo seems to be fairly consistent. While ""Tangerine"" went from slow to fast to slow, ""Dancefloor Principles"" starts out fast and stays fast, with little variation. If you have a hard time dancing to any part of this CD, you need to check yourself for a pulse. DJ Heather is one of the best house DJ's out there; hear the difference for yourself."
4,Heather is on point with the track selections,"True to form, Heather once again captures the house sound. Her variations of tech and funky house is complete on this set. Being a deejay myself, i did not find the blending too smooth. Although, this cd does have an excellent track selection for the house junkie. It will keep you dancing all night."
4,BEYOND PROFICIENT,This is an impressive product. It's bigger than you'd image and has a sleek design... what seems like enamel paint is incredibly nick and scratch resistant. The box itself is anything but tinny... you could easily stand and jump up and down on box. Only weak aspect is the lock--given the weight and size of the box you'd think lock would be a bit larger.
3,It's ok,Well the inside of the box that separates the money...one of the dividers was bent when I got it and broke...Other than that...I really like the box. It does what it's job is to do. It's not bad for the price.
1,Sentry-Safebox,I was very pleased with my product. It was shipped to me right away and I was happy with the price.
1,Disappointing,"Maybe it's just me, but these stories were depressing, stories of wierd people doing wierd things. I chose it to read while flying home from a trip to Italy. I have not finished it, but I will have to push myself to finish it. I enjoy reading stories about countries when I travel to them. Maybe someone else will reply to this and give me a reason to finish reading these stories! I am over 60, so I think I know a good story when I read one. Please someone give me some perspective, some argument, some insight."
1,Did not work for me,I have the an Ultralife 10 Year Smoke Detector Battery model U9VL-J. It has a use by date of 2017. The battery was installed in an ionization smoke detector on 07/05/2007. It was purchased 1-2 years before that. The detector just began giving the low battery warning on 4/30/2008. It did not even last a year. I generally get at least a year out of regular alkaline batteries in this detector. Maybe this battery is better suited to backup applications where the primary power source is house current.
4,"Works as advertised, depending on the type of smoke alarm","I had 3 of these installed in smoke alarms in May 2003, so was disappointed when two of them failed after about 4 years, and the last one just began to beep after exactly 5 years.But then I discovered that the alarms I'm using have dual sensors (First Alert SA301), containing both an ionization and a photoelectric [these are not hard-wired, the battery does it all]. Therefore, if in reality, the batteries are running two detectors at once, I guess it shouldn't surprise me that they lasted half as long as advertised. Also, my alarm doesn't qualify for the 10 year warranty, because it contains a photoelectric sensor - the warranty is for ionization sensors only.Cost wise it's probably a wash, one could buy several alkalines for the cost of this one. But the savings is on time: not having to change the batteries as often."
1,Dead in a little over two years,"I have a smoke detector on a high ceiling, and changing battery is a lot of pain. Therefore I decided to put in the so-called 10-year battery and hoped I won't have to worry about it. It died in a bit over two years. Ironically, the regular, non ultra-life 9V batteries that I put in about the same time in my other detectors still run fine."
1,Nowhere near 10 years !!,"Lasted just over a year, which for the price is not a good deal at all ! I've hoped it would last at least several."
1,Rip-off Alert - zero stars,I am not sure how they are still in business because this is clearly FALSE ADVERTISING. It hardly lasted over a year. Surprised they have not been sued for this.
2,"10-year, my eye","I bought four of these Ultralife ""10-year"" batteries (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004W3ZE/) in the spring of 2009 for our battery-operated smoke alarms and as backups for our wired alarms. They started failing earlier this year. The last one failed today. In other words, a maximum of 3.5 years -- 35% of advertised OR LESS.One could argue that at $8/3.5=$2.30/year (or more), they're not too different from the recommended replacement of one regular 9v battery each year. But the point of the purchase in the first place was the peace of mind of not having to mess with batteries for practically the life of the alarm. I have to admit I was disappointed."
5,mine lasted more than 10 years,"The last one I bought lasted more than 10 years, just giving out today, so I can't complain. Further, it is a tight fit but not unmanageable."
1,Lasted 3 years as BACKUP,"I used these as backup batteries in AC powered smoke detectors in hard to reach places. Both detectors show that they are getting AC power. However, even as backup batteries, they lasted only 3 years. Whether this is due to the design of the detectors or a fault of the batteries is unknown, but it's dissapointing nonetheless. Especially since it decided to start beeping at 2 AM."
1,Only lasted about a year,Put in smoke detector and lasted a little over a year. Will go back to duracell ultra's instead. Did not last as expected.
2,No better than Coppertop for me - 2 years,"Bought two of these two years ago and both are now dead after being in my hard-wired smoke detectors. This is the same amount of time I get out of regular Duracell Coppertops which are much cheaper. Would not recommend. It's unfortunate since I firmly believe that lithiums SHOULD be better in smoke detectors than alkalines, but these seem to be faulty in their implementation or perhaps I got a bad batch, but I don't intend to buy more to find out."
2,Doesn't live up to the hype.,"I purchased ten of these batteries because of the 10-year expected life and the good reviews. After only one year I began replacing them one by one as they failed - the constant beeping from low battery, was what tipped me off. I just added this to another of the many life lessons learned by experience. I hope this short review keeps someone from making the same mistake. Just buy a cheap battery and replace it as needed with another cheap battery or get one of the ""name"" brands and hope for better luck than I had with the mis-named ""Ultralife"" batteries."
2,2 Years Tops,"I'll echo what others have said. This lasts longer than an alkaline battery, but you are unlikely to get 10 years from this battery. I used this battery in my smoke detector and I doubt it was in use for over 2 years."
3,Est. 4 Year Life in Smoke Alarm,"If you are wondering how long this battery might last in a smoke alarm, this lasted 4 years in the one of ours I bothered to note install date on. Obviously your experience may be different with different smoke alarms.I installed into an ionization smoke alarm on 07/08, the low power beep alert started 07/12. I confirmed on a battery tester the battery was running low."
2,"Disappointed, 1-3 years for me","Installed 7 of these on dual-sensor Firex smoke alarms back on March 19, 2009, and just replaced the third (fourth?) one tonight. The first one only lasted a little over 6 months, but that alarm had a bad wire in the AC wiring so it was probably running on battery the whole time. The next one lasted just over a year (and I think there was another one that failed around the same time), and now I just replaced another one.Very disappointed. For the price, I'd rather buy regular Duracell or Energizer batteries and just replace them every 18-24 months."
1,Battery double-talk,"Lithium batteries excel with the lowest rate of internal leakage of any type of battery. This means that they will retain at least 80% of their charge during STORAGE for more than ten years. However, when used to OPERATE a device such as a smoke detector, a single lithium battery will slightly outlast two of the same size alkaline batteries. Claims for greater than 2X lithium versus alkaline battery endurance are based on non-typical use in extreme temperatures, and/or unrealistic comparison with obsolete zinc-carbon battery technology.Nonetheless, certain expensive ""10 yr"" smoke detectors embody a special, NON-REPLACEABLE, large capacity lithium battery which has given seven years' service so far, in my experience."
1,Worse than standard alkaline 9v,I purchased 10 of these batteries from a local dealer 3 years ago to go into my 10 smoke detectors. Half of the batteries failed within the first year and the local dealer I purchased these from replaced them and three of those failed within their first year along with a couple more from the original set. Overall these have less life than I was getting from standard Alkaline 9v batteries. Next time I'll go with a major brand of Lithium 9v batteries rather than these off-brand ones.
5,Best book ever!!!,"This is the best book ever! It is the real life story of Juanita Mojica and her family as they live in the mission fields of Costa Rica. It is the real deal!!! This is a true inspiration and blessing. Juanita Mojica also founded the ""One Child Fund"" an international orphanage. She died and left this book and the ""One Child Fund as her legacy. She touched so many people's lives; don't miss out on this book!"
2,Inferior to Bayreuth/Stein because of severe cut,"Good performance except for cut of entire prelude to Act III and, at least in Laserdisc version, contains noticeable poor splice near end of Act II. Hans Sachs seems old, possibly somewhat feeble, and his essentially throwing a tantrum during Act III scene in his shop seems out of character for my perception of the personality of Hans Sachs."
1,It's out of print for a reason,"Awful book. Read half of it, won't bother to finish.The focus on the book is on a host of idiotic characters, some intended to parody well-known figures, rather than on M*A*S*H characters (which is to their benefit). There's also no real relation to the TV show (also to its benefit). The plot is absurd, the writing style irritating when it's not failing at being cute or clever.There is nothing to recommend this book. Hooker should be ashamed that he put his name to this, and Butterworth glad that his work as W.E.B. Griffin puts this dreck in the background.If I could give zero stars, I would."
1,Middle vial is a poor design choice,"The reason you use a long level is generally to transfer marks along a long surface. One guy holds the level on the mark the other guy makes the next mark. With only one vial in the center, you need three guys - one to read the vial. There used to be lots of two-vial levels on the market with the vials near the ends, where they should be. Seems the jokers in marketing don't understand how their tools are used and figured they could save money by sticking the vial in the center. It's a bad design."
2,Great Level-If AMAZON Gets It To You Undamaged!,"The level is exactly what I wanted: very well made and accurate.My problem is not with the level, but rather with AMAZON. That is why I have rated this item 2 stars. It does not matter how well made the item is if AMAZON does not care enough to package and ship it so that it arrives intact.The packaging of this item is UNACCEPTABLE & CARELESS. Flimsy, single layer box-NO packaging material what-so-ever. The top end of the box was gone...the level could have easily fallen out and been damaged. VERY DISAPOINTED THAT AMAZON WOULD BE SO CARELESS!!!I will have to rethink future purchases with AMAZON because of their terribly careless packaging."
2,Doesn't fit,"Did not fit on my Nikon D90, kept falling off. Good idea, but needs to be constructed better."
5,Genuine & Appealing Insight,"The other reviewer says that if the book had not been presented as history it would deserve a 5 star rating. I also thought when I picked up the book that the historical argument was tremendously tenuous. However, taken as modern artistic interpretation of ""Old European"" goddess culture, not documentary about such culture, which is all it technically claims to be, it is wonderful. Myths are NOT historical. None of them. Sometimes a historical story is behind a myth, but often not recognizable. But myths are gross revisions of stories. The key is the revisions appeal to some part of the human unconscious, and seem to make ""true"" statements about the state of the collective human psyche. As such, and the author does after all present these as ""reconstructed myth"" not actual transcripts of old texts, then anyone reading the fine print would not be mislead about historicity, and the book should get its deserved 5-star rating."
2,"Pretty Myths, Bad History","If the author had presented this book as a feminist utopian religious tract, it would have rated 5 stars, but as history, it's abysmal. The writing in the main body of the text is pretty enough to rate 2 stars, but the opening essay is an ideological nightmare: shaky claims for a pre-Indo-European matriarchy are only the beginning. If you buy this book, enjoy the myths for what they are, but take the ""historical"" intro--which fills almost a third of this slim book--with a full shaker of salt."
4,More action then horror,"The original suffering blended horror and action quite well and the setting was one of the most original setting for a horror game. The sequel on the other hand doesn't in general have that same creepy atmosphere like the first game, This one is more in your face monster slaying with very little puzzles, and little reasons is to why monsters are attacking only Baltimore and not any where else. Some of the reasons as to what the monsters represent looses its vibe compared to the first game. The game's presentation though is very good everything for the most part looks a lot better then the first game a lot more detailed characters, gritty urban streets and the grainy filter is always a nice touch. The game has a few endings that warrant replaying the game few more times which is huge plus since there's no other game modes. Its still good game but it looses that horror edge when setting the game in a city"
4,"Much, much faster","I bought this card to replace the stock video card (NVidia GeForce 6600) in my G5 Quad. Processing in Aperture was kind of pokey with that card and I was looking for an improvement. With the X1900 imports are about four times as fast (a huge, and welcome, surprise) and as I had hoped various editing features are also significantly improved.I did have a few drawing glitches with early versions of Leopard but these corrected themselves as Apple sent updates.The only downside to this card is noise; when it's being used hard (not only for Aperture but also video/DVD display) its fan really blows, making the Quad a whole lot noisier. For day-to-day use, though, it is fairly quiet.If you need more speed this appears to be the only aftermarket choice for G5 PCIe, and unfortunately it commands a high price as a result even though it is a couple of generations behind at this point. Still, it is a superb performer relative to the stock Apple offering. Recommended."
4,Good story,"I enjoyed this book it is more a romance novel. For once its the hero with more hangups than the heroine re Maxi and Chris. However I agree that Myra blew things way, way, way out of proportion, when she saw the hussy with her husband she should have approached them, to me she wimped out and almost destroyed her marriage cos of it."
4,A Great Read!!!,"This is the first book I have ever read by this author, and I must say that I was not disappointed. I read the book in one day even with my 15month old son around. Just goes to show you that I couldnt put it down. It just goes to show you that there is a thing called love. The only thing I was mad about was Mia and her attutude towards her husband after he told her about his brief contact with the cheerleader. Homegirl went overboard. She was too extreme. Trust me married men have done alot worst. All in all I would say that this book was a great read!"
4,Great read,"I'd initially read Gabe and Sage's story first, so it was good to finally read Christopher and Maxi's story. Great love story!"
2,My tastes for that type of book is dwindling.,It is not the fault of the author. I am just trying not to consume any more of that type of book.
3,Nice,Worth it to read the book kept me interested and I enjoyed the story. I suggest others to read. Enjoy!
4,Love,"This is my first Brenda Jackson book, and i love her style of writing. This is a great love story, with all the complications of life and relationships. A true love that reaches way back in time for all four characters."
4,Perfect Read,"Okay, so I know I'm late with a lot of Brenda Jackson books. But I'm sorry for sleeing on her for so long. She really is blessed with the gift of writing. I love Perfect Timing. I thought this book was so good. She brought Christopher and Maxi together after 10 years of not seeing each other since high school. He gave her the ultimate gift without batting an eye because that's how much she meant to him. Love it love it love it. I can't wait to read Gabe's story now in Perfect Fit. Go 'head Brenda. Love ya!"
5,Perfect Timing,I just loved this book this is the first Brenda Jackson romance novel that I read and was hooked from the first page to the last needless to say I now own all of Ms. Jackson's books and always go back to those when I am between books or just need a feel good book
3,MAINSTREAM FICTION OR ROMANCE NOVEL?,THE BOOK TO ME CAME ACROSS AS BEING MORE OF A ROMANCE NOVEL. THE FEMALE CHARACTERS WERE NOT AS DEVELOPED AND I HAD THE FEEL THAT THE BOOK RUSHED TO THE END. ALTHOUGH THERE WERE SOMETHINGS I LIKED ABOUT THE BOOK BUT I FELT LIKE I WAS READING A ROMANCE NOVEL.
3,"Entertaining, but not as good as A Family Reunion","A breezy read of two relationships with excellent character development. The dialogue tends to be a bit stilted, and it does suffer from poor editing in the form of missing commas and overused words, which gives it somewhat of a slapped together feel. This book has been touted as a mainstream title (or, as stated on the inside back cover, ""women [sic] fiction,"") but it's essentially a romance novel a la Danielle Steel with the happy ending easily foreseeable. I would recommend A Family Reunion by this author as being a tale with more substance."
4,"The novel is exquisite, this printing is not","A warning to anyone purchasing this edition of The Man Who Was Born Again (Black Mask). This edition is actually missing several pages, and you can see this even in the ""Look inside this Book!"" preview!Page 5 ends mid-sentence and page 6 starts with a partial sentence from another portion of the book, which should be several pages in. This is far more distressing than a mere ""typo"", as anyone trying to read this marvelous book for the first time will end up confused right from the start, and will miss several of the very first pages that build up the story!I ended up sending this back and buying a used Dover edition (the ""double-feature"" with Meyrink's The Golem), and I can assure you that those missing pages are accounted for there.I normally would refrain from making negative remarks in a public forum, but this book deserves to be read by many, and it is unacceptable that the only ""new"" version available is flawed."
2,small,this product is ok i guess for concealing an extension cord or two but that's it. bought it for tv wall mount cords. no way!!!!!
3,The adhesive isn't what I expected,"I bought 4 sets of these to conceal (2) 14 gauge speaker wires for a 40 foot run. They held the cables with a little room to spare, and they look very clean on top of my baseboard trim. The elbows and connectors are also nice. My wife is hard to please, and she was very impressed with the cleanliness of the install.My problem is..they arrived slightly warped. I tried to straighten them out before installing, but perhaps I didn't do a good enough job. 1 week after install - I found about 60% of my run has un-stuck from the wall. I wiped the walls prior to install - so there was no dirt or debris of any sort, I held them firmly in place to ensure a tight seal, and I was very careful to allow enough slack on both ends of the cable to avoid excessive tension in the cable run. Perhaps I was unlucky with a few batches. They definitely didn't ""tear off 3 layers of drywall"" like many other reviews suggest."
4,Does the job but at a price,"This is the perfect solution for hiding cords/wires/cables without having to poke holes in your walls. The ""II"" kit has guides that are wide enough to hold several thick cords and quite a few smaller wires at the same time. (The smaller size, which is round, has a MUCH smaller capacity--just a couple of thin wires will fit.) After painting, it's very unobtrusive. Drawbacks: quite expensive; will tear drywall off if you ever want to remove it."
4,"Not Perfect, but","Its not perfect, but definitely worth the money. I am sure an experienced person would do a better job. It beats trippin over wires."
3,Too Small For My Cables,I was going to use this for running the HDMI and Power cords from my projector across the ceiling. Unfortunately it is too small for my 22awg HDMI and 16awg power cables to both fit. These are a little thicker than normal cords but I only needed the two of them to fit.
4,Works,Works great and takes paint easily. The only bad thing is if you have to remove it they will take part of the wall with them.
2,Ok for a few months,"I bought this back in February and it is now November. After about 30 days of installing these on my ceiling and only running a single HDMI cable through them, the adhesive lost its stickiness and fell off the ceiling. We replaced a few pieces with some spares we had from the original order but they now have also lost there adhesiveness and I am probably going to have to use Contact Cement to get these to stay on the ceiling. I guess they work as long as you are prepared to find some other way to mount them than using the adhesive that comes attached to them. :/"
1,Open package and dimensions incorrectly listed!!,"Package arrived open. Dimensions listed in description are wrong! They are H 48"" x W 1"" x L 0.5"". You can only fit 3 cables in it. Adhesive tape sucks and won't stick well!they list dimension as:Length: 1.20 inchesWidth: 2 inchesHeight: 48 inches"
1,Get a little more creative,"They have an inside elbow, an outside elbow, a tee but not a cross, how lame. Do they ever use these products?"
3,"Works well, but...","These work well, but you must make sure you have them positioned correctly on the first try. Reapplying is not an option. I would like it if more pieces came in a package, but they work well for their intended purpose."
4,Hides Cables Great,"Great product, easy to install. It can easily hold a cable line and HDMI cable. Not sure if you could fit more than one more cable in it."
4,"Nice Product, worth buying","You get 3 strips of plastic which can each hold about 3 'cable-size' wires. The strips have a self adhesive back to attach on the wall/floor. It also comes with a few 'elbows' and connectors which is nice. only downside, that cutting the strip short was a bit difficult. Otherwise a good product and delivered as always on time and quickly by Amazon. Be prepared for it to be shipped in a larger than expected box (some 6-7' long..)."
4,Neat & discreet,product dimensions lend very well to easily blending into the background and easy access to add/subtract cables in the run as needed
4,Works good but marks its territory,"In my apartment I found myself in a rather awkward situation where I had to run cables all over the place. Having found this cordmate kit did the job.Taking this off was difficult, but I soon found using a hair dryer makes it come off easier. When you want to pull this off a wall use a hair dryer to heat the cordmate before and as you are removing it. There were still some black spots that stuck but not many."
5,Amazing!!,I love this product. I used it to conceal cords on my TV located above the fireplace. It was so easy to install. Anyone can do it!!
3,As advertised..,"The kit has most of what is needed but I found that more elbows to go with the amount of tubing provided would be helpful. Also, this is not the wide sheilding, so if you want to hide all your wires under one this is not the right kit."
5,Awesome!,"This product is really fantastic. It took paint well, and the wife approves of me having cords running all over our apartment now.Honestly, looks good and easy install. It's kind of hard to cut pieces, but then again i have been using a kitchen knife so it's probably easy with any type of saw."
4,Works Great!,"This product works great to organize and hide the cords coming from your tv. I would definitely recommend painting them the color of your wall so that it blends in and isn't noticeable. If you the actual electrical plug running from your television is too short to reach your outlet, you will have to figure out another solution because the casing is too small to house the plug or extension cord ending. After installation, I had plenty of casing left to use on another project."
5,Great CM System,"I have purchased ten of these over the summer. The work for everything from Mediabridge HD cables to Logitech Z5500 speaker wire. As far as setup goes, you can't get any simpler. I'm very picky about purchasing things like this due to the ""not knowing exactly what size cables and how many it can handle even if I read the dimensions"" factor. So far, it's handled my entire setup. At night time you can't even tell they are on the walls (a little more obvious during the day when I know I put them up). If you're thinking about purchasing this, even just to try, do it. You won't be disappointed."
4,"OK, but way too expensive.","This wire manager kit has everything you need... elbows, 4ft long rails, etc but its way too expensive for a simple plastic product. It looks like its ""Made in USA"" stated on the actual product packaging, so I guess I don't feel too bad supporting us... wait a minute... a high volume sales plastic thing still made right here? WOW, now I'm impressed. Anyway, it works good, sticks well to the wall, looks good too. I was able to fit two 12 gauge speaker cables and a coaxial cable TV wire thru it and still manage to close the latch, though a bit tricky. Overall nice product. I have seen the real cheapo versions of these and this is better than those. A bit of advice installing... lay down on your stomach when applying it right above your molding, to be sure it is going on straight, take your time or you'll be pulling your wall down to fix it."
4,Pricey - but serves its purpose well,"The product works: I have two pairs of 12 AWG speaker cables and a Cat 5 Ethernet cable running around five corners. It hides them well and the housing blends in nicelyTwo things you might want to look out for:(1) The adhesive -- VERY sticky. A good thing. But if you set it in the wrong place, don't expect to be able to reset it without providing your own glue (and tidying up the mess it leaves behind the first time)(2) The ""joints"" work very well IF you don't set an edge of the housing flush against the skirting board/wall/ceiling: they need a little extra wiggle room and if you apply the housing too close, they won't click into place."
5,Hide your cables easily!,"I was looking for some conduit where I could run a coaxial cable and an HDMI cable over two door frames between my computer and my flatscreen TV. This worked like a charm. Both cables fit well in the channel. The conduit stuck very well to the trim around the door frames even though the trim was not perfectly flat.I would strongly suggest that you open the conduit before you stick it up. It's a lot easier to open it before than after. Other than that, installation was a snap and it sticks very solidly. A very easy solution to something I thought was going to be much more difficult. This is a great product."
2,Nice product but is not what is advertised.,"I have to only give this 2 stars.The product description says that this product is 2x1.2x48 when in fact it is 1x.5x48.This is a significant issue. If I didn't need to do this project in 2 days I would probably send it back for the right product.I think I can force the cables I need in here and have it stay shut, if it does workout then I may raise my star rating to 3 but the whole ""false advertisement"" in the dimensions has really set me back.Outside of that the product itself looks good"
5,great solution,My wife was very unhappy with the four sets of speaker wire from the wall to the back of our receiver. The wiremold contained all four with room to spare. 12 feet of cover plus various corner pieces made a custom solution. color is a little off white but blends ok with white mollding.
5,My Wife Loved,"My wife is a big reader of historical fiction, whereas I would not touch the stuff (although I can't complain about ""The Killer Angels"" in light of the ""Gettysberg"" movie). I bought this book for my wife, who is a very, very smart woman, beacause she asked some questions about Marie. Wifey must have come across her in a book regarding Queen Victoria & her mucho progeny.The wife loved the book so much, that when I told her there was a chapter in a book I have on Versailles (1919) about Romania & how it more than doubled its size, she insisted on reading the chapter.Any book that can get my wife to read even a chapter of a relatively hard-core history book gets a 5 star tribute."
4,Texas Style Blues,"I saw these guys at a little bar and grill north of Houston. What a great show. Too bad the place wouldn't let them crank the volume. This album represents what I heard that nite. Great stuff! They play lots of original material. But, they also played a Robert Johnson tune and Stevie Wonder's Superstition. But, they did their own version of Superstition, not a rehash of SRV's version. I recommend this album. You should hear more about these guys in the future."
2,Not Great,"I found this book confusing. I am pretty good with HTML and have some experience programming Visual Basic.I would not recommend this for beginners. It did a decent job of ""how"" but left me in the cold about ""why"".XML, XSL, XSLT, XPath, DOM, SAX, DTD, EDD, how do all these relate, or do they? The authors assumed Javascript expertise and did not communicate toward beginners, but experienced web programmers.Chris La Porte"
1,useless as a pamper,"These diapers fit poorly and after getting wet only once it would hang off my 3yr old son until they would finally just slip down his legs. He hated them and refused to allow me to put them on him. They also were very ""puffy"" and looked like big layered lacey underwear. Waste of money. Going back to using ""goodnites."""
4,works pretty well,"I use these on my 8 year old severely autistic son. We use them as a daytime diaper, since he is way too big to fit into the largest Huggies/Goodnites diapers, yet too small to wear adult size diapers. It works well for us, even though he is way over the weight limit stated on the package. However, we cannot use them as an overnight diaper for him. He urinates quite a bit while asleep and this diaper would not be able to hold it all."
1,cats not interested,"My cats love catnip, but they weren't the least bit interested in these. I bought two, one for each cat, and neither one played with them. Maybe the catnip was too old and lost its scent? I would not buy again."
4,compact yet efficient,This is a great little device which has your basic am/fm functions with presets and XBS. Included neck strap is an added bonus for hands free listening. Also has a built in stop watch. A backlit display for night viewing would have been really nice though.
1,cheap,"First off, it would not hold the ear plug very well to keep the conection for the sound. Second, the directions were difficultand time consuming. It took my wife an hour to figure it out. It is hard to send back when you get charged 20% restock fee plus shipping. Not Happy!!!"
1,Panasonic RF-SW70K Radio is Terrible,"We never could get this radio to work correctly. The most it would do is continually scan for stations, never pausing more than a second or so. We were not able to set any of the presets. The user friendliness was terrible. Even had it worked as we thought it should, it was still not easy to remember the process to use it. Either it was broken or of such poor design that a reasonable person couldn't get it to work (and my field is technology). If it was broken, that speaks of poor quality control. We returned it for a refund. Waste of time."
2,For 30 Bucks It's Okay,"I've had this for well over a year. FM of course is limited to line-of-sight distance to the station, and I wouldn't recommend this to anyone in the San Francisco Bay Area (or any other city with mountains or 2,000 foot hills for that matter). AM is okay. It's small. The battery life is great. BUT, I lost the instructions. It is almost impossible to program the five stations (10 with FM) intuitively. It may have only 3 buttons to diddle with, but these buttons have to be held in one of two or four directions to lock in a station. So...unless I'm going to listen to my one primary baseball station, I just take my MP3 player and listen to music on walks."
3,Cologne for a man's man,"Unique and musky; if you've known someone who's worn this cologne in the past, it is immediately recognizable. It's certainly not going to be everyone's cup of tea. But it's the best among colognes of this sort, which are generally too noxious-smelling to bare. Not the cologne one would expect to find a teenager wearing these days, but it's still nice to put on here and there if you're a man among men. Find a way to sample it first. This one grows on you."
4,Fairy Houses- the Series,"My Sister told me it was a wonderful book!- That my almost 8 year old niece liked it very much- I included it in a package with the ""Wee Enchanted Garden Kit"" so she could make her own Fairy Garden. My Sister sent me pictures of my neice making the Garden on Facebook and I received many inquiries as to where I bought these wonderful items. Thank you!"
5,Nice choice for kids!,"My 7 year old G'daughter really enjoyed this story and pictures.I have shared it with friends going on vacation with their children and we all agreed that ""making a Fairy House"" together is a wonderful family activity and sparks the imagination!"
3,Just what I wanted,"My granddaughters and I love to build fairy houses so I thought they would enjoy this book. The ""rules"" for building the houses (e.g. only natural materials) have become our rules as well. Of course, now they are waiting for the fairies to show up! A sweet little story."
3,Mostly a rehash of screen shots,The book is mostly descriptive without a lot of contextual and experiential value added on top.
2,SLOOOOW,"I bought this item because I thought it might be similar to a product I'd seen advertised years ago on television. I expected a lot of energetic action: short soundbites of various animals romping, jumping, tumbling, splashing, chasing, pouncing, etc. There is very little of that in this product. Most of the content includes images of animals sort of slowly exploring something, standing about, chewing, etc. I bought it both for myself and for my son. Neither of us found it interesting enough to watch in one sitting."
4,"Wittgenstein, the man","This book is enlightening, not only for a history of the development of Wittgenstein's thought, but also for its account of his emotional states and mystical experiences. It is not generally appreciated that Wittgenstein was an intensley spiritual man who struggled with his own ethical dilemmas about how life should be led. I ended up with a great feeling of love for this truly unique man.Well worth a read."
3,you have to like the person to love the book,"I do not have major problems with the book though the writing certainly did not capture my attention. I stopped liking and admiring Wittgenstein half way through the book. I was drawn by his ideas to his biography. However, just like what an old saying says -""If you like the egg, you don't need to know the chicken that laid it"", I should have just stayed with the ideas. Wittgenstein might be an accidental genius but certainly not someone likable (by my criteria)."
3,Wittgenstein is interesting.,"Wittgenstein is definitely an interesting philosopher, but requires a lot of thinking and time to find yourself in his mind. The book was alright."
2,Very biased,"I am surprised by how, it seems to me, Monk distorts or reinterprets what the memoirs and reports of others have to say about Wittgenstein. He slanders and discounts anyone who reports how introverted and self absorbed W was. I have many questions about the validity of his contributions to philosophy, but it seems to me that he was an extremely self centered and not very nice man. After dismissing practically everything Russell says about and in responce to W, I am curious how he handles this in the bio of Russell."
2,A botch.,"One certainly couldn't fault Mr. Monk for being clever! Monk is the kind of biographer LW would've wanted. He approaches LW's life with the god-awful seriousness LW himself did. I can take it from LW, but who the hell is Monk. Better try Bartley's _Wittgenstein_ or even Toulmin's _Witts. Vienna._"
5,Nearly Perfect,"Well written, intelligent, and not afraid of it's subject.Good introductions to Wittgenstein's thought and religious feelings.I can't imagine a better biography being written about one the most interesting human beings to ever live."
5,Amaizing,"An intelligeble manner to learn about this (Not so) Genius in my concern but amaizing character. Very recomendable!!! Make sure to read it and evaluate the content, Monk has done an incredible job by creating this master research into a bibliography!"
4,Battle of the strongest (AKA Cooler's Revenge),"I've seen the fansubbed version of Battle of the Strongest (Cooler's Revenge) It was the best DBZ movie out of the 4 before it. I haven't seen the American version, but going to see it soon. The jappanese version was great, and I thought it was so cool. But, Attack! 1,000,000 power warriors (Return of Cooler, coming August 6th) is way better. But still, Battle of the strongest is a great one. Goku finaly goes SSJ in an American movie. My advice is pick this one up."
2,A little bet of a letdown.,"I don't believe Dragonball Z is very well suited to the limited running time of movies. DBZ is much better suited to the series where it has more time to develop the characters and create tension.This movie seemed even more predictable than the other ones, but I think the main problem was the short length of the battles especially the one with Gohan on his way to deliver the Sensu beans and the final fight. Granted given the characters it makes sense that the battles weren't allowed to go on longer, but there wasn't enough tension built up throughout the movie.Concerning the soundtrack, how lame. The only time the heavey metal or whatever ... it is worked was with the History of Trunks, the other times it's just been stupid.All that being said I don't even think I would consider an essential viewing for a DBZ fan like most of the other movies I would."
4,Cool Cooler,"I have not seen the movie, but I know that if you buy the videoyou get 3 cards for the Dragonball Z card game."
5,Cooler's Revenge Review,"This was one of the best videos out of the whole movie series.To make it better, there is a good chance when you buy the movie, you can get three rare Cooler cards.Well anyway,Goku,Gohan,Krillan,Oolong, and Ikerus go on a camping trip.But it is disturbed by Friaza's evil {and stronger} brother Cooler.This is one of the two movies Cooler's suppose to star in. But in his second movie he appears as Metal Cooler.Not to spoil anything but you will see Super Saiyans Goku and Vegeta{this is amazeily the first movie Vegeta will fight in it}. But the first movie of Cooler's is really good.If you take the time to buy the movie,you may get three rare Cooler Cards.And don't forget to buy the Buu Saga.Yeah,I mean the WHOLE SAGA!!!!!!I can't wait and Buu starts absorbing."
4,freeza had a brother?,"well there is always a lot of surprises in the DBZ series and movies. just when you think that all of Freeza's family is dead, here comes his brother. certainly we all know what happens, he comes they fight, and boom: the good guys win. if youre not a DBZ fan id recomend you watch the series before you pick up any of the movies or specials. most people hate these series because they dont know the story behind them, and the movies just take place at certain time periods of the series. over all this is a great anime for those that like DBZ. its #4 of 12 i think and would be a great addition to fans who collect them."
1,Could of done much better,"This is the worst dbz movie ever. You just can`t push someone into the sun because it is 92,960,000 miles away. Don`t waste your allowance on this piece of JUNK."
4,"Good movie, with some of the better dubbing I've seen.","Usually when Funimation dubs a dbz movie it just [stinks], but this one actually wasn't THAT bad. Sure there are a few really corny parts with Goku worrying about animals and innocent people, and the japanese version is WAY better, but still, its not as bad as what they've done with the rest of the series.One Pro that the English version actually has is the music, but then again, if you're not into deftones and disturbed like me then stick with the japanese.There are only a few insignificant problems I saw with this and they are: 1. Goku still, like in movie 4, says ""I ain't"" in the subbed version on the dvd. That just bothers me for some reason. I'm not sounds so much better. 2. They made Salza have a french accent in the dubbed. Why? Just Why? 3. The dvd menu is garbage. The graphics are okay, but they could at least put some more info on it.Other than those its a must buy. Oh, by the way, the Spanish version is hillarious!"
3,only half a movie,"I saw the japanese version and i liked it; altough, it is only about 40 minutes long and the next movie witch also features Cooler is even shorter.Why don,t they combine then, it would still be shorter than 90 minutes like most movies and other animes like RUROUNI KENSHIN and others run over two hours.Maybe it's because DBZ is so popular, but Funimation is ripping us off, but i'm looking forward to see it in english.i'm also looking forword to movie#7 Brolly, the legandary super sayian"
4,A beautiful echo,"Hats off to Green House Music for releaseing yet another high quality ambient release. The title of the album ""Echoes in the Emptiness"" perfectly describes this droning ambient excursion. Exuviae lays down elegant synth washes over a vast soothing landscape of delicate echos and whispers. This album create the perfect atmosphere for theraputic clearing of the mind and physical relaxation. Light some incense and candles, sit down and let ""Echos in the Emptiness"" carry you into and through the clouds in your mind. Any Eno/Roach fan needs to hear this album. If you or someone you love hasn't been turned onto ambient music, this would be a perfect introduction."
4,Just right to get back in shape,"I have been moving and thus got out of my routine of practicing yoga at home - I wanted something that was not too challenging, yet would help me jump start some conditioning as well as my overall flexibility. I like the laid back atmosphere created by the scene selection and the modifications she and a partner offer for certain exercises. A very nice moderately challenging workout for a more beginning/intermediate level. The added movements do turn up the heat and feel more aerobic - which has been instructional for me to explore how I can adapt my yoga practice to my particular needs of the day ..."
3,"Not my favorite, but it will do.....","The sequences move quickly. This is ""supposed"" to help you create heat and burn fat. This isn't for those new to Yoga. The workouts are short which is good, but there is a lot of movement within the poses. Overall, an ok DVD. By the way, the scenery does nothing for the workout itself."
3,"annoying instructor, not aerobic, good strength building","This dvd is challenging to someone who does cardio and weights about 2x a week, but only because it is a good muscle workout, especially if you do all 40 mins. It is NOT, however, a good aerobic workout. Also, the instructor is incredibly annoying in my opinion. She speaks almost in monotone, as if it was very hard to memorize the script and she can't make the effort to be natural. More importantly, the workout itself is extremely repetitive and boring, which means I never use it. For a more creative fat burning yoga tape, try Crunch Fat Burning Yoga. I think the instructor in that tape, Sarah Ivanhoe, is far more appealing. No yoga workout is going to be truly aerobic unless it's an hour long or more, but with the fat burning tape, at least i break a sweat if the room is warm."
4,Good workout but really aerobic?,I love Yoga Zone DVD's and I love yoga which I have been doing for about a year but this does not feel like a fat burning workout. It can be fairly intense if you really sink into your lunges etc but I have not been able to break a sweat (and I am about 50lbs overweight) or to get my heart rate up. You can really feel your legs toning though so the DVD is still worth it I just don't know if I buy the actual fat burning part.
3,Boring But Challenging,"After using several other yoga videos, I found this one to be a little boring and unmotivating. The instructor is very well educated/trained in yoga, and gives detailed directions for getting into positions, and excellent breathing instruction. It doesn't go through very many different poses, though. Instead, they do a pose, hold it a long time, then add a new component and do it again, and so forth. Good challenging level -- I can certainly see how these moves would burn plenty fat! There are 2 segments on the DVD...one more challenging than the other...but both lack enthusiasm and encouragement, and are focused on specific instruction and explanation, rather than providing an element of relaxation and supportive dialogue, so that the viewer will look forward to tomorrow's workout."
3,Good CD............,This is a good Cd..........but not enough songs peaked my interest......Again not bashing these guys but i think the first one might have been alittle better............
3,I AM ENERGY!!! !!! !!! !!! () - ),"I'm from Oklahoma i listen to energy 9275 on the internet, and let me tell you this cd rocks!! !! !! It's got everything you need to party hearty!!! this is Justin t saying I AM ENERGY"
2,Just a pool cover,Not very good at heating the water. We had it on for several days but there was no real change in water temp. But works well to keep leaves etc out of the pool.
2,Much Thinner than I Expected,"My fault maybe because I did not look for the thickness of this before buying, but I was shocked at how thin this cover was compared to my old one. It Mics out about 6.5 mil. I can't imagine it lasting more than a year, maybe two.Size was OK, however both ends were not cut completely round, they ended with a straight edge. It was not a bi deal to me as I trimmed some of it off, but if you want to perfect fit, it might bother you."
1,Lasted 1week,It started pulling apart at the seams after only one week! I'm thinking of returning it but I didn't save the box and it is very big. $50 worth of junk!
5,Exceeded my expectation,"I initially saw this brand on Walmart site. But they take longer for delivery. So, I looked at amazon (my favorite online shopping site) and found here luckily.Before purchased this one, I looked at many other pool solar blankets online. I wanted to purchase more expensive one (12mil, even 16 mil) since my 15 feet rounded pool water so cold. I was worry that this might not be thick enough to warm up my pool.I was wrong. I covered my pool with this for 3 days. When I jumped in my pool I immediately feel the water at least 10 degree higher than without this blanket. To be honest, I had never expected this warm before purchase this. The outside temperature at that time was around 90 degree.It was very easy to cover my pool by myself. It fitted perfectly with my pool. It feel pretty strong. I hope it last for couple of summers. However, even if it last for one summer, it still worth the money.Cons? NONE"
5,Just as advertised,This cover was just as described and works great. We purchased the 15' cover for our 15' pool - we didn't have to cut or trim it - Fast Shipping.
5,Worth the money,"I was going to buy the cheaper version of just a ""cover"" but noticed this was ""solar"" and after reading other reviews I bought it. We are MORE than happy, it fits with plenty of coverage and then some, we won't cut it as we just pull the excess up on the liner and the coverage on the pool is great. The way it heats the pool is amazing, it's nice and warm and better then we could have expected. This is a purchase I can honestly say is worth every penny. Spen a litte more and you won't regret it!"
1,Don't waste your time!,"What a horrible little book! Contrary to popular belief, Scottish cuisine has much to offer, despite the reputation of traditional Scots' fare like the infamous haggis. If you are looking to prepare such food at home, however, this is not the book for you. A cheap, hurriedly put together mish-mash of poorly described dishes, many of which hardly qualify as recipes at all. Gives ""Neeps and Tatties"" a bad name!"
2,miserable,"This book is unsuitable for use in an academic setting. The author cites NO research that counters his positions (and much exists), does not provide glosses for foreign language passages, and frequently editorializes. Many of the citations are not academic (or even reliable) sources. The tone of the book suggests that it was written for weekend business retreats for HR people, not for a graduate or even undergraduate class on culture in the classroom. The book is poorly structured, and the chapters are not often about what the chapter intros say they are about. I would not use this book again even if it meant getting fired."
2,Common Knowledge to all Cat People,"I was hoping to figure out how to solve the issue of the new kitten vs. grouchy old cat so we could all live in harmony. This book didn't shed any light on the topic. The author claims to be a Cat Psychologist but quite frankly, I think anyone with a cat can do the same. She's against putting cats on leashes and all for letting them roam free. She constantly whines about a cat's bad behaviour and how people then put their cat to sleep. I can't say that I've heard of that happening too often. She does cover a few topics such as travelling with a cat, moving, stress and should you own a cat. I wouldn't recommend this book at all."
2,Is it suppoed to sound so muddy?,"I am new to the Kinks (except for the obvious hits) and bought the deluxe Village Green Preservation Society. Discs one and two sound excessively distorted and muddy to the point of distraction. I cannot believe they are supposed to sound like this. I found it to be a terrible disappointment.The music and comprehension of the material is great, however, and makes me truly wish for a clear remaster."
2,Village Green Preservation Society (Dlx),"I am disapointed with this CD, it does not include any of their top hits. This is for Kinks die hard fans only."
2,taech yourself brazilian portugese compleate course,"I recieved your product, it's fast. But not compleate it is no cd. I can't use this book complealy, it no sound."
2,Weak,"Apparently you are supposed to follow someone's journey in Brazil and learn from their experience, but you don't. Language guidelines are minimal and scattered. You never get the full answer to anything. The whole thing is feeble, there isn't a sound structural framework behind it."
2,Eva Marton y los demas,"En esta Tosca solo se salva del fracaso la gran EVA MARTON, que hace una encarnacion realmente buena en lo vocal y en lo escenico de la heroina de la obra. LAMBERTO FURLAN es un Cavaradossi de voz excesivamente vibrada y JOHN SHAW un Scarpia al que le cuesta hacerse oir por encima de la orquesta en el primer acto, aunque mejore algo en el segundo. Los secundarios todos discretos. La orquesta suficiente, conducida por ALBERTO EREDE. Demasiado clasica y ya algo anticuada la puesta en escena. Muy irregular el sonido: las voces se oyen lejos y la orquesta tiende a taparlas; ademas, el sonido tiende a la saturacion. Es preferible comprar otra version."
1,Not as good as Total Defense,"This cream is SPF 15, Lamas Total Defense was SPF 20. Pro-Vita also has a slight sun screen smell which Total Defense did not have. Total Defense also blended into the skin more easily. I don't know why they downgraded the daily moisturizer from a really great product to a fair one. I guess it was cost? Hope they bring back Total Defense. Pro Vita is okay but I wlll continue to look for somnething as good as Total Defense. What a pity."
4,Really good moisturizer,"I really like this moisturizer because it's light enough that my skin doesn't feel clogged/blocked after applying but it's heavy enough that I don't have to re-apply it three minutes later because it's all soaked in and my skin is dry again!I also like that it has an SPF 15.I'd like it better if they'd stuck with the initial SPF of 20. (The SPF 20 product had a different name, but it's basically the same. They don't make that one anymore.)And I wish it were all natural instead of half chemical.I will continue to use this product due to it's consistency (lightness vs. heaviness) because it's SO difficult for me to find a product that strikes that balance however, I will continue to look for a replacement due to the naturalness factor.There is an Earth Science product which is all natural, and is very good in terms of consistency, but sadly, it has no SPF."
2,Can't use a lens hood with it,"This product offers a convenient solution for those of us always losing the lens cap, but at the cost of not being able to use your lens hood when you have it on (because the diameter of the cap is larger than that of the lens opening, so the hood doesn't fit over the margins of the cap). It's also not easy to take on an off, so it's not a good solution to just take it off every time you want to use the hood. It's made of rather cheap plastic that has to be pushed into place when you sandwich it between the filter and your lens. When I took it off the threads on my filter were making screeching, scraping sounds and I had to really pull to get it off. I was afraid for my filter so I decided not to use this gadget again. I would only recommend it if you're going to leave it on permanently and never use your lens hood."
5,An excellent and informative introduction to the subject,"This is an excellent and informative introduction to the subject, and is recommended for anyone interested in the history of British road transport. This edition is 48 pages with 32 pages of photographs included in the page numbering. It is No. 80 in the Oakwood Press' Locomotion Papers, from 1974.This is primarily a brief introduction to the subject accompanied by a large collection of photographs.The Contents are -P02: ForewordP03: Transport in East Anglia; Motor Buses ArriveP05: Formation of `United'P07: Charabancs; TrolleybusesP08: Town TransportP09-40: PhotographsP41: Eastern CountiesP43: Some Bus Operators in East Anglia 1901-1931P44: Note on Bus Chassis featured in this bookP45: 2 x illustrationsP46: Acknowledgements"
3,Hoping for more,"This is a mostly made up version of the famous ""Bone Wars"" between Marsh and Cope and would have been more interesting if they had stuck to the facts (see ""The Gilded Dinosaur"" by Mark Jaffe). More art work of the dinosaurs would have been a bonus. One of the few dinosaur books I've given away rather than kept."
4,Believe It Or Not - The Bone Wars,"In the graphic novel Bone Sharps, Cowboys, and Thunder Lizards, Jim Ottaviani and the folks at G.T. Labs take on E.D. Cope and O.C. Marsh and the Bone War. In the last third of the 1800's, geologists were exploring the West, and two of those geologists, Cope and Marsh, were looking for dinosaur bones. These rivals discovered and named many of the most famous dinosaurs while carrying on the most famous [sometimes violent] feud in geology. Bone Sharps, Cowboys, and Thunder Lizards is a fine book, but didn't impress me to the level that the earlier graphic novels Fallout and Suspended In Language did. I still highly recommend this book to anyone with an interest in history, the old West, dinosaurs, and is willing to give the graphic novel format a try."
3,"Great Try, But Doesn't Get It","Tremendous effort at a daunting task to bring this great poet over to English, but the English just doesn't sing or thrill or inspire. Nevertheless, a good record of the work of the Bard of Shiraz."
2,Disappointed...,"Every flip of the page has a different idea or project to do for Christmas. They aren't good ideas. Definitely an aquired taste. Everything requires skill and a lot of different items that might be hard to find. This book should only be bought by very craft minded people or people who have a lot of time on their hands. Unfortunately, I wont be using this book for anything."
4,Christmas,Inspirational craft ideas that I can use throughout the year to prepare for next years christmas gifts for family and friends.
2,Of Women and Horses,"Nice photo's and philosophy of individual horseman(women), does not provide in my view much information on ""training"" which is what I had hoped for."
5,Sleepless in Ohio,"I received this book about a month ago and can't put it down. I've read it over and over again, needless to say I have lost many hours of sleep because I just can't unglue myself from it. The intense emotion and enthusiasm that these women express towards their love of horses really hit home for me. A very compelling and insightful book for anyone who has a passion for this magnificient animal."
5,A man doing a book on horse women?,"It's about time, GaWaNi has done it again. I laughed, I cried and felt deeply for many of the women in this incredible book. I first heard about it when I saw him on Larry King Live with Bo Derek, Terry Ventura and Chaia King (the latter two are actually in the book) and thought it might be an interesting read.....I have this on my coffee table and come back to it time and time again. What's nice about the format of this book is you can read one or two of the essays, and come back to it later - a very convenient read, and nice to go with whatever mood I happen to be in - (and ladies, we know we have many) you will find a story to go with every one!I've had several friends try to make off with it - but told them to get their own! Beautiful artwork and a gorgeous layout make this pleasing to the eye, and the thoughts and words will move your heart.I heard a rumor that he's put out another one, can't wait!"
2,The Jury is Still Out,"After an apparently successful installation, the ""Wave Profiler,"" module repeatedly crashed my machine. Installation of the patch offered by Cakewalk did not seem to be of any help.At present, I am able to record MIDI. Due to the aforementioned problem with wave profiler, however, I am unable to record instruments through mic/line input.I believe this software does have potential. Hopefully I will be able to realize it in the near future. This reveiew will be updated accordingly."
5,Absolutely delightful,"Gentle but yet amazing, this music grabs at your heart and does not let go. Listening to it changes the way I think, it moves the creative process. Absolutely delightful!"
4,Wellll.,"Frankly, I was a bit disappointed with this cd. I probably should stay with ""just cello"". This cd seemed to contain very little YoYoMa in the foreground, which is what I love. Also, it irritates me when a song is repeated on several different cd's. I want all new!"
5,"Such Passion, Such Pleasure","Yo Yo Ma's continuing exploration of different music has reached a zenith with this Brazilian effort. His performance has never been more direct and pure; you'd swear he was raised on Copacabana Beach. His song selection is superlative. The lifestyle passion of South America, and Brazil especially, is so free and open and reflected in the way music permeates its entire culture. Mr. Ma obviously enjoyed himself with this recording. And so will listeners. Personally, I hear a Grammy nomination with this. . ."
2,"By Bossa Nova standards, just ok","The first time I listened to the CD, I thought, ""Let's give it a few more tries...Let it sink in."" It never did. The talent is there, but the creativity and passion are not. Bossa Nova is not applied classical music. Classical music is beautiful; Bossa Nova is beautiful. But they are different. There is far more exciting stuff out there in the Bossa Nova world. Kenny Barron's gig with Trio da Paz; or Morelenbuam(2)/Sakamoto -now that is Bossa Nova cello! Surely Yo Yo Ma could some day be a great Bossa Nova cellist, but until then, don't waste your money."
2,misses the point,"As a long time fan of Brazilian music, including its more classically orientd side (Villa Lobos, etc.), I found this CD a major letdown. Uninspired and lacking any sense of the spirit of Brazilian music, it really is a waste of time."
1,Very Disappointing,"I was excited to get this as a gift. Then I played it. I expected some fun and Sambas. Pretty dull, very little cello, not even pleasant as background music. I put my copy in the pile for Good Will."
3,artful music or easy listening,"While I like many songs in this CD, there are an equally large number of songs that are close to easy-listening music. It is no longer new from Mr. Ma to use his masterful skills to bring a new sound into music other than classic music. This CD is good, but you do not have to buy it."
3,A little Dull,"I had the luck to see Yo Yo Ma live in concert, it was so fantastic, I went out and bought this album. But the joys of a live concert sometimes don't make it over to the album, whichsounded dull, it makes good back ground noise but it doesn't hold your attention."
4,Love Lucy Monroe,"Although this was not my favorite Lucy Monroe Book, and I read the trilogy out of order(since this book was not available on kindle or readily available in book stores), I did enjoy this book. Of the 3 in this triloy it was the most perdictable. That said it still had the Lucy Monroe feel to it and I would recommend it."
5,piggy,"My parent's dog just loves piggy,I gave her to her and she wouldn't put her down the rest of the day"
5,Well written book!,"When I first got this book from the public library I was so astounded by the information that I had to buy a second, permanent copy (from Amazon). This inside look of Russia after the fall of Communism and the (dangerous) rise of Vladimir Putin to the head of this dying thugocracy is one of the best books written about modern day Russia. The author has gained (nasty) details on what is really happening inside Russia, information that the mainstream media won't bother to tell you. A well written book; excellent! Buy it today!"
2,outside access to sensitive information,"Digital Defense is written primarily for the corporate security professional and the IT professional. However, throughout it, Parteny sets out case after case, situation and situation, where outsiders can gain access to competitively sensitive data.Some of the cases involve breaking the law; others involve violating contractual relations. But a significant number involve employee and contractor carelessness. In doing that, he illustrates the very reasons why companies concerned about improving physical and IT security to protect competitively sensitive data also need to develop and maintain a defensive CI process to supplement them. All three programs should, and can, work together to protect corporate information assets.Book review by John McGonagle, in the November/December 2003 issue of Competitive Intelligence magazine, published by SCIP www.scip.org"
4,Excellent study of the German army in Russia in WWII.,"Bartov does a fine job revealing how the average German soldier thought, how the savagery of the combat combined with their own racialist attitudes towards their opponent to allow them to commit or tolerate the commission of atrocities. Bartov also describes how the vaunted mechanized Panzer army quickly bogged down into WWI-style infantry combat, and that the high rate of casualties destroyed German unit integrity. Bartov's description of German soldiers' ""war tourism,"" including photographing mass executions of Jews, dispels myths about the ""good"" Germans. They may not have all been Nazis, and they were not all war criminals, but by and large they did share Hitler's racial attitudes. This accounts for their grim fanatical resistance as well as the atrocities. Highly recommended."
2,Vague conclusions and a lot of weak arguments,"The information used to form the arguments in this book was very weak.Many letters from the eastern front were used,to show how the German soldiers still had faith in Hitler. I would like for the author to show ANY letter from any soldier from any country that made it through censors that was not upbeat and full of faith in their leadership. Needless to say I was very disapointed with this book. It is of minimal use as any sort of a refernce."
4,Interesting if at times bland,"Bartov's book focuses on the German Army fighting on the Eastern Front. Bartov challenges the previous, although outdated, thought that the German military was apolitical and a wholly professional fighting force. The author points out that the Army was eventually molded in Hitler's image, with the army eventually seeing the war as a fight to defend German civilization from Jews and Bolsheviks. Although I don't agree with every little detail of the book, it is very interesting. The only downfall is that Bartov does tend to repeat himself and that the book can be dry at times. Still, though, it is worth a read."
2,Disappointing approach to prove a point,"Mr. Bartov, to prove his points of the Nazification of the German Army in World War II, uses an excessive amount of quotes from various German soldiers' letters. A chapter of these is fine, but when Bartov resorts to using the selected information in these letters throughout the entire book, the reader soon grows tired and bored. Any good historian will tell you, letters and/or oral histories should be use selectively; usually they can lead to a distorted view of history. And a distorted view of history is, as Mr. Bartov should know, not good history!"
1,The worst book I ever read about the Wehrmacht,"Bartovs dubious method to prove that the German soldiers were influenced by Nazi-Ideology by using letters which were edited by the german Ministry of Propaganda (!!!!), isn't a serious scientific method. He selects his sources with view to his wished findings and ignores many other, more scientific editions of letters of German soldiers, because they would contradict his theories.In some cases he has interesting ideas, but he can't prove them by sources. In general he simplifies to much and doesn't try to get a more differentiated view.There are much better books which fulfil scientific claims, like the books of Wolfram Wette, Harald Welzer, Hannes Heer and Gerd Ueberschär - but they aren't translated up to now. Maybe ""The War behind the Eastern Front"" from Alexander Hill is an alternative."
4,An Interesting Look at the Germany Army under Hitler,"This was one of the books we read in a seminar on Nazi Germany at Mary Washington College taught by Porter Blakemore. This was an excellent little read. The book offers an unique look at the German army during WWII under Hitler. It was unique in that it focused attention the non-SS, ordinary soldiers of the German army and their role and responsiblity in WWII. I recommend reading this book at Gordon Craigs's Politics of the Prussian Army."
2,"Some good details, but in the end only Agit-Prop","Bartov gives some useful details but in the end his generalisations smack of the ""guilt-by-ethnic-association"" the Nazis used against Jews, just because a great number of Jews helped the Communists. It is political history in the worst sense. Read Christopher Browning for a common-sense study of what happened at the Eastern Front."
1,"Poorly researched, Flawed Methodology, Sweeping generalizations,","It seems like Bartov decided upon the results of his research first, then cherry-picked whatever sources he could find to ""demonstrate"" that the Wehrmacht became ""nazified"". He makes sweeping generalisations based upon flimsy evidence and poor logic, then expands upon the results to make even more flawed conclusions.For an excellent critique, see[...]"
5,"Great quality, reasonable price",This survived a rocky trip down a shallow river - stayed fully inflated without tearing or losing any air! Great product for an incredible price!
2,Came with a hole in it. Expected at least a week of use.,"I expected to be able to share this with family while floating down the river every day for a week in yosemite. It had a hole in it, didnt figure out where. Luckily we have spent a bit more for 2 other floats for me and my husband that were fantastic. We were being asked by everyone where we got them. They were the Intex River Run Sport Lounge. They have drink holders and handles and are a much better value. Went over rocks, etc and no holes. Brought them home and still in good shape, also good for different sizes of people. I would have rated it higher on fun probably if it worked."
4,somewhat delighted,These floats seem to be holding up a lot better than most floats. The colors are very vibrant and add to the anbiance of the pool.
2,"Fun for about 2 days, then popped","Bought this to use in the pool during a trip to Cancun. It was really fun for a couple of days, but then sprung a leak."
4,Tube,"We actually bought these tubes to use in a dress up relay game for a birthday party. They got jumped on, fallen on, etc., and help up just fine."
5,Good Stuff,My family and I have spent countless hours of fun floating around our pool. The size of the product fits just about anyon
4,Fun tube,"Tube held up well for the summer. Fits kids great. Not sure grow ups would do as well actually sitting in it, but they could float around holding on to it by the handles. There's only 1 per box though - not 3 like the cover on the box shows!"
3,no design variety arrived,"Ordered 2 rafts and 3 intertubes - expecting the 5 designs in the display to arrive as shown. Got 2 identical colored rafts and 2 designs out of 3 innertubes, so...little variety. Disappointing. Why doesn't Amazon realize what is pictured is misleading and change it!?"
2,"It's a tube, what else do you want??","FOR SOME REASON, I thought 3 tubes came in the package. No biggie. You don't get to choose the design. This tube is for fun, not for safety. Keep that in mind."
1,Misleading Picture,The product page is extremely misleading. I purchased this product expecting to receive 3 inner tubes and only received one. I am very disappointed
2,A Disappointing Waste of W.C. Fields,"It's easy to see why W.C. Fields hated ""The Big Broadcast of 1938,"" since his unique talents were ill-suited for Paramount's musical-comedy revue. The few memorable moments in this 90-minute hodgepodge can be found during the first hour - highlighted by the Great Man's surreal golf routine and Bob Hope's ""Thanks for the Memory."" If director Mitchell Leisen was hoping to recapture the vaudevillian spirit of 1933's ""International House,"" he completely missed the mark."
1,"Very cheap, nothing like the picture.","Ugh. I ordered these for my mother for Christmas, but now that I've received them, I'm going to the mall to get her something else. I would be embarrased to give these to her.The stone is MUCH smaller in the real thing that in the picture, and the body is more elongated, so the whole earing looks disproportionate. The working in the silver is shoddy, and the stone is hung badly and tilts down or twists around backwards."
3,Not a full workout,"Don't buy this DVD if you are looking for a full workout. This doesn't make you sweat or even get into any real yoga techniques. The DVD consists of two 10-minute segments, which touch very briefly on some basic stretching principles. None of the poses are even held long enough for you to get any real benefit from them, if this is your sole source for guidance. I use this DVD after doing other workout routines to complete my cooldown and stretching. I find most exercise videos do not provide adequate stretching at the end of the workout. So I throw this in and get a little extra stretching for my muscles. It helps to chill me out and cool me down after tough cardio or aerobics. That is all this DVD is good for. I don't even see how it could improve your overall flexibility in the long run, given its short duration. But hey, doing something is better than doing nothing. And maybe these 10-minute bites will entice you into investing in a more in-depth DVD."
2,Umm...,This doesn't really do anything for me...Maybe if you haven't ever worked out before it may be a good beginning for you to start.
2,Not the greatest for tight and inflexible,"To let you know where I am coming from, I am out of shape and fat. I wanted a primer to increase flexibility before trying ""exercise."" I would have thought that a video which had both stretching and flexibility in the title would have systematically and progressively worked on each major group of muscles - this one doesn't. Session one has breathing instructions while session two doesn't. As a beginner, it helps to be reminded to breathe. Rodney Yee's videos seem to be better at involving the whole body and the exercises flow together."
5,This was great!,"This dvd was great! I have gotten very stiff over the last decade and was having trouble with flexibility. When I did the stretches on this dvd, it really helped. I became more flexible and no longer feel the stiffness. I felt a HUGE difference in only a week. I would definitely recommend this dvd for anyone who is very stiff and wants more flexiblity."
3,Maybe not for a relaxed stetching routing. Better for the tad advanced.,"I think this DVD is okay, but one to rent occasionally from your local library rather than purchase. The instructor barely pauses to take a breath the entire program. Her tone and cadence plus a rather stimulating music background make for an agitating routine rather than relaxed enough to ensure there are no injuries during this routine. Its pushing it a bit for beginners esp as the student or person beside the instructor is terribly flexible. His positions are for the very advanced."
2,Too easy,"This DVD is too easy for me, even if i'm a beginner.I'm fairly young - 30 - but i need something more challenging.It's also pretty short, The 2 sessions must last about 40minutes total.I would have expected at least 1h of yoga."
4,good for yoga workout if short on time,"There are 2 workout sessions that are maybe 15-20 min each. I think the instructions were good, quality was good. If you are looking for a longer workout, look elsewhere but if you are want a basic stretch workout you can squeeze into your day this may be for you. The poses are basic to intermediate - this is more stretching style yoga rather than strengthening or power yoga. I enjoyed the 2 sessions but wish they were longer."
1,Terrible,"The characters do not look like the cover...the story line is boring, my son couldn't get through 5 mins of this. BIG waste of money!"
3,Too scary for tots,I was a little disapointed in this one. Parts of the story are scary for a 3 year old. We only played this one a couple of times and I don't see us getting back to it in the future.
1,A one-sided manifesto,"This book is supposedly about the Palestinian Authority but it is really a biased history of the palestinian people, without any mention of terrorism. Posters of ""Zionist terrorists"" are shown while there is no talk of suicide bombers or terrorism (except that it is a shame people call it ""terrorism""). Hamas, El Aqsa and the other terrorists organizations are not mentioned. Even though this book was published in 2003 the history of the Palestinian Authority after 1996 is not mentioned. The Intifada and the Palestinian Authority is only mentioned briefly on the last page. So why is this book called Palestinian Authority?It is apparently an apology for terrorism, without mentioning the terrorism.How this book ended up in our local library, I cannot say."
5,Enchanting Escapism,"Rich historical details in a romance novel not only help bring another era to life but lend depth and richness to the delicious love story of Clemency Cameron and Jamie MacLean in ""Summer's End"" by Lynne Hayworth. The background of the novel covers the Jacobite Rebellion in 18th century Scotland driving Scots immigrants to the New World. The heroine, Clemency Cameron ,is blessed with healing powers and an unusual knowledge of medicinal herbs, roots, and flowers. Some early medical treatments are detailed as well. As a New Englander, I was intrigued to read about the role witchcraft played in society during that era. As we approach Valentine's Day amidst the coldest winter in several years, I strongly recommend ""Summer's End ""as an enchanting escapist read.This is the first book in a trilogy so I am anxiously awaiting the April installment."
1,Save Your $2 and Buy A Double Jr. Bacon Cheeseburger From Wendys,"This movie was like smoking a $5 crack rock but with less impact on the hit. The first movie was okay I guess, the woman ended up being some prostitute. The second and third film I don't know what the hell was going on because I never made it that far. Save your $2 and buy a bag of chips and a canned soft drink for lunch."
3,"Predictable, pedestrian, likable","I knew from the beginning that somewhere in this book there would be a scene in a hospital and I was more or less correct. There is just nothing new here, unless maybe a reader still finds lesbian romance shocking. I've read too many mother-daughter relationship books, I guess, and books about young women finding themselves. The writing was very good."
1,Poor quality looks cheap,"From the looks of these online, they would appear to be all chrome. When I got them, half of the horns were black plastic with bad mold marks and tubes that had to stick out where you could not hide them. Much different than I expected. Will return and spend more on something to get something worth while"
3,HEAVY,TYPICAL CHINESE QUALITY. SORTA HARD TO PUT ON. ON A LOOSE FOCUS LENS THIS WILL PULL YOU OUT OF FOCUS WITH IT'S WEIGHT. NOT SO BAD WITH AUTO FOCUS.IF YOU JUST HAVE TO HAVE IT MOUNT IT SO IT OPENS DOWN AND OUT INSTEAD OF LATERAL.
2,"Not a ""Family"" Cookbook","This book was not at all what I expected. I was looking for fast and healthy meals to put in front of my family every night; and with the title being ""...For People Who Don't Have Time To Cook"", I assumed it was geared towards busy families. Unfortunately, the majority of the recipes are not kid-friendly. Dishes like Cider-Poached Salmon with Spiced Pear Sauce, Grilled Swordfish on Herbed Couscous with Vegetable Minestrone, and Middle Eastern Lamb Stew are not likely to please my brood. I sent this book back. 2 stars because the presentation of the book is nice, and I'm sure someone looking for fancy dishes like these would enjoy it."
4,Replica of Monopoly with a fun bug spin,My kids enjoyed this game at first but the length is long like Monopoly. My tween was able to keep her attention but my younger two got bored. The shorter version will probably work for the younger kids and the bug spin makes it more fun for the kids than Monopoly. I would still recommend this game for a family that likes board games.
4,I got the limited edition,"Well, actually there were two different limited editions of this score. The first limited edition had a slightly different cover and the CD itself has the Jurassic Park logo in shades of blue as well as the island itself. Back in 1994 I got a second limited edition soundtrack of Jurassic Park. It featured only two tracks from the film, 'Theme from Jurassic Park' and 'End Credits'. The first was a suite of all the main cues and the second is the same as the final track seen here.If, like me, you found the score in the movie to be to repetitive then I suggest seeking out this rare release and getting it instead. All the best themes get a good workout and it's good to listen to whenever you want a feel of Jurassic Park without having to listen to many tracks on the other releases. It comes with a free poster and is released by MCA, as is this release and the first limited edition."
5,Can you really say anything bad???,Come on - it John Williams!! This soundtrack is a new Americn classic. Lots of great horn features. Love it!
4,John Williams does it again,"When Jurassic Park was released, I had to see it. When I had, I bought the soundtrack. The tracks are powerful and yet playful. In the movie, the dinosaurs had some overwhelming power. So did the tracks. Like Raiders of the Lost Ark, John Williams makes the movie an adventure with this fine soundtrack."
4,Dinosaurs!!,"Everytime I listen to this soundtrack, I get the chills. It's a great sound, and I put it on as background music. It makes everything I do a little bit more intense. But the theme song will get stuck in your head for a week!"
5,A Modern Classic: My Single Favorite Score,"Jurassic Park was a publishing phenomenon and blockbuster film franchise.John Williams gives us music for the dinosaurs of the film as well as man's failed attempt to tamper with nature.There are three themes I want to cover here: the four note raptor motif heard in tracks 5, 11, 7, 15, and 16, the main themee heard in tracks 2, 4, 7, 13, and 16 (which is a fragmented repeat of track 7), and the helicoptr motif heard in tracks 4, 7, and 16.Jurassic Park was probably my first experience with film music and one I will never forget. This is a boy's score and one that will make you jump and floor you with its power and beauty.Along with The Land Before Time, I consider this to be one of the finest scores ever for a motion picture.This score captures the mystery of the prehistoric era and childhood and will be one you listen and wear out over many happy years. So before they butcher a remake, go out and get this wonderful piece of music before its gone. Enjoy."
3,Jurassic Park soundtrack,"I loved the books and I loved the movie. I had to have the soundtrack, too. As with most soundtracks, there are parts where you cannot hear it and then loud parts. That's frustrating, but that's par for the course. Still, I love all the instruments and can picture what was happening in each song."
2,Cracked!,I had ordered this as a gift to a very good friend of mine... we are very very into soundtracks from movies and its something special from me to him.. only to find that the packaging was very weak. My cd case came home cracked... and we are very careful with our items.. I was really upset.
3,"Unfotunately, never got it","Dont know if it was bad luck or I got bamboozled but I never received the CD. jachujanan has good ratings so Im going to use the benefit of the doubt and say that something bad happened. Nonetheless, Im saddened."
5,Absolutely Stunning,"Jurassic Park is the best score John Williams has ever composed. The score sends tingles up my spine whenever I listen to it. Everything about the score is so perfect, though the tracks are disorganized. My absolute favorite track is ""Journey to the Island."" The trumpet fanfare makes me excited as the explorers arrive on Isla Nublar. Violins, chellos, double basses, and violas add to the wonder that is the dinosaur. Other favorite tracks of mine include ""Theme from Jurassic Park,"" ""A Tree for My Bed,"" ""Welcome to Jurassic Park,"" and ""My Friend, the Brachiosaurus."" I highly recommend this score to everyone. Go get it now.A word to a certain someone called Preston Jelmet, you did not compose the score to Jurassic Park. John Williams did. Go put your lies somewhere else. You're just a big idiot who wants attention and to be noticed."
5,Williams's last really GREAT score for a Spielberg film,"If we were still flying under the ""Union Jack"", John Williams would certainly be knighted by now. Contemporaries Elmer Bernstein and Jerry Goldsmith only rival his contribution to motion pictures.But, that withstanding, his score for ""Jurassic Park"" remains one of the maestro's most dynamic, poetic, and challenging accomplishments. The ""Theme from Jurassic Park"", while slightly pompous, still projects the massive scope of the scientific and entertainment complexity of the story line. Interspersed throughout the score, the familiar melody adds equal parts of drama and pathos.One of the best cuts is the excitingly menacing ""Dennis Steals the Embryo"", heard as the treacherous park employee absconds with his booty and meets his end. ""Eye to Eye"" and ""T-Rex Rescue and Finale"" are also thrilling pieces that musically capture the onscreen tension and danger.Williams has never put to paper more awesome ""little black dots""."
5,"powerful,subtle, yet grand",POWERFUL. FILLS ME WITH EMOTION. SAW THE MOVIE AND THE MUSIC MATCHES IT PERFECTLY. IT MAKES ME FEEL SO GOOD INSIDE. TRUELY WILLIAM'S BEST WORK. MAKES A GOOD WAY TO PUT YOURSELF TO SLEEP WITH TRACK 11. this page smells bad.
5,A Beautiful Show of John Williams Talent!,"This is an awesome CD. The main theme is so lyrical, you hum it all day long. The action music will get your blood pumping, and the icy tone of the raptor tracks will send shivers up your spine.It is an excellent score to a truly excellent film. There will never be an equal to John Williams."
5,A Dinosaur Movie?,"""It's a dinosaur movie?"" That just about sums up the reactions I've seen of people who have just heard John Williams' beautiful score for ""Jurassic Park."" Williams created a piece so captivating and beautiful that one would never guess it was written for a movie about dinosaurs chomping up visitors to an exotic island park. Williams begins the piece in his usual ominous way,and just when you think the surprising bass ""thump"" is going to begin,the violins start what is going to be a beautiful song."
4,Salad days FG's at their funnest!,"This is the release, an EP by the flamboyant Bay Area group. This is also one of their funnest and finest moments. Almost like songs for old Max Fleisher cartoons. These guys were messing with the hippies minds doing sraight ahead rock in a time of psychedelic and folk rock music. Songs are: Golden Clouds, The Slide, Love Time, Babes in The Sky, I'm Drowing, Prelude In A Flat To Afternoon of A Pud and My Yada. You can hear samples on iTunes' available album, Babes In The Sky which includes bonus cuts, You Tore Me Down and Milk Cow Blues. Mooo"
1,Ill Defined,"I purchased this dictionary for my 94 year old mother who is an avid reader but must use large print. There remain very few words she doesn't know the meaning of but, even so, she uses a paperback dictionary with small print frequently.While she was excited when she received The Large Print American Heritage Dictionary,it now collects dust on a shelf.This dictionary is useful for seeing impaired children and adolescents but too narrowly defined for adults."
1,OK for kids,This book is a large print dictionary and laid out very nicely but if you are an educated adult then dont buy this book! This is a small dictionary and most of the words in this book you probably would not need to look up. this was a total waste of money~ May be good to give to an elementary level child!
5,Dictionary,"This is a wonderful book, nice and big and large wording. I really enjoy looking words up in it as now i can see the words better. It really is a great book for anyone with difficulty in seeing small print. I use it all the time. I give it a 2 thumbs up!!!!!! S.P."
4,Excellent Worship CD,"This is a refreshing difference from ordinary CD's. I enjoyed it very much - and continue to come back to it over and over. My only complaint was I found some of the words hard to understand the first few times I listened, but with the help of the word sheet, that was soon overcome. I would highly recommend this CD for anyone who is hungry for a out-of-the-ordinary worship experience. Very scripturally based words. Excellent voice and vocal technique."
5,Love a new idea,"I love the idea of taking beautiful music and putting heartfelt words to it. Freddy's voice is not as consistent as ""The Tenors"", but it is a wonderful recording with all the Pavaroti music I love but words that could have come from my own heart."
5,Sooo cute! The adult version of the girl's locked diary. hehe,I love this thing! You can track your sexuality throughout the year! IT's actually educational and has quizes throughout it! Something really fun to pull out on a boring movie night!
4,A very compact pair of binoculars,"I have had these binoculars now for over a year and have taken them on vacations, sporting events, etc. Their physical measurements are 3"" L by 4"" W (they are wider than they are long). Because they are so compact, I find myself taking them with me most places verses the larger binoculars I have. I have large to extra large hands (based on my golf glove size) and I have no difficulty with this compact size. They have a coated rubberized finish that makes them easier to handle. They are plenty adequate for general use and the 10 X is about the greatest magnification you would want without much vibration."
2,Burnt Rice every time,"My $20 rice cooker cooks rice better than this. I usually cook 2 cups of rice (white jasmine) for the family. I add 2 cups of rice and fill with water to the ""2"" mark and receive burnt rice on the bottom every time. Will try adding a little more water and update."
3,"So far, so good","I bought this after reading the reviews, so I knew there were plastic parts I might not like. That is true, but so far, so good. I make small batches of rice and steel cut oats. I thought it might make small batches poorly, but the rice was perfect. The steel cut oats are difficult to make on the stove, but it was so easy in this machine. They result was very good oats and I only made 1/4 c. I didn't have to stand over the stove for 1/2 hour.I have my doubts however that the non-stick pan will last very long. It seems cheap and the coating looks as if it will deteriorate rapidly. I will give more feedback. I just hope it lasts long enough for me to get $70+ worth from it.Pros: nice size, easy to use and to cleanCons: too much plastic and seemingly cheap pan."
3,Plastic,"I have a similar model. Since the non-stick was wearing off, I am looking for just a replacement on a minimum budget. The inner cover seems to be plastic in silver color while the one I had is real aluminum. The non-stick paint looks medium quality. The idea of steaming plastic prompted me to return it right away. I finally picked Panasonic SR-NA18 as my replacement. This one has a stainless steel inner cover and the non-stick paint has better quality. The down side is an extra $50. I do not care about those fuzzy logic. Only hope it will last longer."
5,"A little pricier than some rice cookers, but well worth it","We bought this cooker for our grown son to have in his first apartment, and he loves it. It's not too big, nor too small. Makes great rice and also makes a super slow cooker for stew, etc. It also doesn't leak sticky liquid around the lid like so many of the cheaper rice cookers do. This was one gift that was definitely a big hit."
5,Excellent,"I love this rice cooker. I never thought the rice would taste as good as mine, but it did. Even my children approve. I haven't used the other features yet but hope to soon."
4,Very good,"I've used it a handful of times and it has made perfect rice each time. It's very easy to clean and the retractable cord makes it very easy to store. The only issue I have is that the timer begins counting 8 minutes before the end....a little strange. But, so far, very good."
5,Rice Cooker,It does a very good job of cooking rice of all kinds. It comes with its own oddly sized measuring cup and recipes but I have found that using the proportions suggested on rice containers produce excellent results as well.It can be used as a slow cooker and even to bake cakes but I have not tried doing either of those things with it
4,Blues Kingpin,"All 6 Blues Kingpins cds are good----18 tracks on each, clean remastering. This is a fine compilation of early John Lee."
3,Why can't publishers edit properly any more?,"Ruth Rendell's novels are excellent but please do not buy Kindle versions, unless you are a user of US English. Do not buy any Kindle book if mistakes in spelling, grammar and punctuation annoy you, as they do me. The standard of editing is abysmal and seems to have been carried out by people who have acquired English as a fifth or sixth language."
4,The mass objectification of humanity!!,"I get the overall feeling that Kim has some personal beef with Descarte. His whole goal seems to be that of destroying the Cartesian view of a body and mind unison. He does have many good things to say in Philosophy of Mind though. The only problem is that he trys so hard to turn man, a thinking thing, in to a rock. An object. In Kim's defense, he does show both sides of the coin and trys not to preach to much. Still preaches, but I guess thats what I bought the book for in the first place."
5,great buy for the money & comfortable too,"this is a very nice fitting and comfortable seat for a rather large fellow like myself. it is sturdy, but light weight. nice camo pattern. i used it to replace a small round seat on a shooting seat and it made a world of difference."
5,Good item,I purchased these to install on my jon boat and I am very satisfied with my purchase. For the price the quality is better than I expected and they have been durable thus far. I would buy them again if I had a do over.
2,eh ... (shrugs shoulders),"I admit it: I bought the movie because of John Denver. I got to see him, so I guess I got my money's worth, even if poor John ends up looking a bit like the Simpsons' Ned Flanders, complete with mustache and glasses.The film discription on the back of the box and quoted by Amazon had little to do with the actual movie. Young Jacob's family was NOT caught in a terrible blizzard - the axle on their covered wagon was broken by a grizzly bear. The only snow I saw was at a trader's camp, which, apparently was at a higher altitude than where the family built their new home, and there wasn't much snow at the camp. Jacob doesn't ""confront"" the grizzly, either, at least not in any way that is implied.The movie itself was ok - nothing fantastic. It may be considered a ""coming of age"" type film, but certainly not in the same category as ""Old Yeller"" or ""The Yearling""."
3,"Maybe not for Indian kids, anyway...","I was hoping to show some Bart the Bear features publicly to local kids, and had to reject this movie due to potentially offensive material. Probably accurate to the times, but I know that some people would consider the use of the term 'Redskin' to be offensive, as well as little brother's comments that big brother, late returning home, might have been scalped. On the other hand, I think the film did make it clear that it was white Indian hunters who were doing most of the scalping. The main Indian character is an old Sioux medicine man who speaks no English, but can communicate with the giant bear. Less offensive, but still a bit of a stereotype.Apart from that, the film was a fairly enjoyable wilderness picture, though not containing anything really exceptional apart from big ol' Bart. And it's nice that it didn't end with the kid having to hunt down the bear, as I first assumed when I read the film description."
1,Ripped Off,"This film was produced under a SAG contract, but sadly, the distributors of this film - John Denver's last movie - have decided to avoid their responsibilities to the actors - and to this day, have failed to pay ONE PENNY in residuals to the talent which made this film come alive. They have ripped off the hardworking actors in this film to the tune of thousands of dollars!Great script, great cast, excellent film for kids. But I would suggest that potential customers NOT support this film. Do not rent or buy this movie until the distributor pays the actors what they're due!!Watch this space for updates!"
4,A systematic reference for modern costume,"I felt that the black and white line drawings were inappropriately ""chunky"" and a bit misleading about the fashionable silhouette for certain decades. Nonetheless, this book is, as far as I know, the only reference that systematically describes the elements and accessories of 20th century costume, and judging by the decades for which I have personal experience, it is largely accurate. (Note: This review is based upon the 1982 trade paperback edition of this book)."
4,"Interesting and educational, excellent narration","The text is well written and the narration by Charlton Heston is incredible. I didn't get much formal philosophy at school and during long drives, this cd exercises my brain without making me fall asleep. A nice supplement to go with the digital music on the commute."
4,A warning for those interested in Soviet Intelligence.,"This is not meant as a review, but as a warning for those interested in Soviet Military Intelligence. This book, and Survorov's other book, ""Aquarium: The Career and Defection of a Soviet Military Spy"" are the same books. So make sure to only purchase one."
4,Inside the Aquarium: The making of a top soviet spy,"I read the book and I thought it was great. It is fantastic to read a book that shows a new world to you. It begins with the author as a Soviet army ""tanker"" through his initiation into Soviet Military Intelligence and then the collapse of his world when an operation gone bad threatens his life. The book creates a sigh of relief that the communist regime is gone. Thanks for the book Victor and good luck to you."
1,unplayable,"The reason I gave one star is because there is nothing lower. All the America's Castles DVDs that have the purple playing surface I have trouble with. None of them play on my best, (high priced) machine but will play on my lesser quality backup. However, ""Return to Newport"" absolutely refused to play on either machine no matter what I tried to get around it. This was very disappointing to me as I had waited for ages to get this particular show. I have no trouble with the America's Castles, two disc, Grand Tour set or with Hearst Castle as both of those have the usual silver playing surface. Beware of purple DVDs!"
4,"Good book, but can the ""humour""","I've had Dreamweaver for well over a year and did not realize until buying this book just how simple it really makes coding webpages. The book comes with a CD with all the lesson files neatly organized. The lessons are step-by-step and clear, and the learning experience is, overall, pleasant. The downside is that Green fancies himself a bit of comedian, and I find his asides neither funny nor necessary. I could have finished this book in half the time if not for his ""cleverness."" Also, he uses emoticons in a published text, which I find unprofessional and annoying. Very informative book, but if I had known about another book with the information and without the comments, I would have chosen that one."
2,Not really about Design,I was rather unimpressed with this book. It is more business 101 than anything specific to theatrical design.You'd be better suited to reading business books than learning about business from this one.
5,CHEAPER THAN AT THE COLLEGE BOOKSTORE,"MY SON NEEDED THIS FOR A COLLEGE COURSE AND IT WAS QUITE A BIT CHEAPER FROM AMAZON, EVEN WITH STANDARD SHIPPING, THAN AT THE COLLEGE BOOKSTORE, OR ANY OTHER BOOKSTORE FOR THAT MATTER. SHIPPING WAS FAST AND THE BOOK IS EXACTLY WHAT WAS REQUIRED FOR HIS CLASS."
5,Anasazi Beans,"These are the best beans you can eat. They look like a red pinto, but the flavor is unreal. They cook up within a couple of hours, so it's not an all day ordeal. I highly recommend them."
4,Cheer Genuis,"I have to give this movie a 4 star because of all the times i seen it. I literally watch this movie 100 times when i was 14, becuase i would watch it while i worked out.It was the first movie i got when i first got into martial arts and bruce lee. Yeah its a pretty cool movie, i brought it a walmart for a dollar."
3,good and interesting for Kung Fu aficionados,"This movie is a compilation of some of Bruce Lee's stuff. The first part is a narrative with excerpts from four of Bruce Lee's early movies from his youth. Then there is a quick biography of Bruce, followed by a lot of clips of his immitaters. Then there is the better part of a movie from hies newest immitater, Dragon Lee."
5,Ths Astrology Handbook (in Chinese) by Qun Jiang,"This Astrology handbook is a complete reference book,which not only comprehensively covers Natal Astrology, but also guides the reader to understand and use it. The book is easy to read although I am a new student on Astrology. The most interesting part is her analysis of real cases. Like other sciences, as the author wrote in her preface, Astrology can guide readers to know themselves and to overcome the weaknesses and possible problems in their lives, if they use it properly. I hope the next book from the author will focus on more down-to-earth cases."
5,This is the Real McCoy!! Buy the MCA version!!,"Want to clarify an earlier review....The bogus recordings appear on the CURB label's version of ""Greatest Hits"". The MCA label's ""Greatest Hits"" are authentic and original DOT Records recordings! Review for the CURB lable Cd was erroneously placed under the MCA Cd.....are you confused yet??"
4,This was a great gift,I have no idea who this artist is but the older lady I brought it for loves it to pieces.
4,Pat can sing,Pat Boone was the good boy rock and roller from the 50s and early 60's and this has most of his best work and few other songs on it. Sounds great and will satisfy his fans if they want to hear his hits as they were first done.
3,Incomplete kit,"I ordered the sensory dome to use with my 4 year old. It arrived just yesterday. I think this is a great idea and a great kit. Unfortunately ours arrived without the second bag of gravel, the blue gravel. At first I didn't care--who needs decorative gravel? However when I read through all the material that came with the dome, I saw that the aloe won't grow without the blue gravel on top of it. Of course by then I'd already planted the aloe. So be warned and check everything through before you begin.Aside from arriving incomplete, this is a cute planter kit that fits nicely into our small space. It comes with 5 small seed packets: aloe, polka dot plant, cabbage palm, eucalyptus, and an herbal mix containing ""assorted herbs including rosemary, parsley, basil, thyme, chives, fennel, dill, marjoram."" I hope the plants grow. Looks like I'll have to break out the plant identifier books to tell the herbs apart."
5,Excellent! Patti at her best,"This a great CD that only gets better with replay. Shows her great range, from soft to belting it out, from funky to smooth. I've owned it for years and still listen to it frequently. Highly recommended."
3,"A good Patti ""chill"" album - not for dancing around the room","While I am a Patti LaBelle fan, I give 'Gems' 3 stars because in my opinion, it leans too much on the ballad side. Don't get me wrong - Patti's vocals are at their best when she delivers an emotional, powerful ballad but 10 of the 12 tracks on this album are ballads. The only real uptempo tracks are 'The Right Kinda Lover' and 'This Word Is All'. If Patti would've included 2 more tracks like these danceful ditties, 'Gems' would be a solid album and a welcome addition to any fan's Patti LaBelle catalogue. This album was quickly forgotten after its release, which is too bad. Patti's previous album 'Burnin' and her follow-up to this one 'Flame' were much better efforts and are definitely worth picking up."
5,Patti Labelle,"I purchased this CD for ONE song (Right kinda lover), but as it turned out, of course I love the whole CD!"
2,TOO BASIC,"This book was much too basic for my review purposes. Also, the questions in this book do not resemble the questions on the NREMT-P test."
3,Plasma Processes for Semiconductor Fabrication,"This book is outstanding if you are interested in a great deal of plasma physics. If you are looking for information regarding device processing, I think that the book does not offer too much. However, there is some information on Si processing specifically."
4,The last but one of a great series,"John Carter discovers an incredible secret while exploring the long abandoned city of Horz, believed by many to be the most ancient ruined city on Barsoom: Orovars, the ancient race of white-skinned Barsoomians, still live outside of the city of Lothar!But while Carter and his newfound friend Pan Dan Chee escape from the secretive Orovarian society, they discover Llana of Gathol, no other than Carter's own grand-daughter. She is fleing from Hin Abtol, another power-mad Jeddak (king) who has decided to unite Barsoom under his rule. Carter, Llana, and Pan Dan Chee take on Hin Abtol and his might war machine!This story, broken down into four parts for serialization, is the last full adventure for John Carter. It comes across as a bit formulaic for anyone familiar with the earlier stories in the series but it's still a strong and compelling action/adventure yarn in its own right."
5,The Fighting Tigers of Ireland,"I stumbled onto this book while researching my family history, and was absolutely taken with the story of these men. Gannon is a gifted writer with a reverence for his subject, respect for the facts and sources, and a warm narrative style. This book is a treat to read, and in doing so you will not only develop a personal interest in the lives of these brave Irish men, but you will understand how their lives impacted the nation we have become. Irish Rebels is a marvelous story, told by a master!"
2,cheap china quality,"their really cheap china knifes their pretty heavy bout 16-18oz. but not sure of steel type 420 "" 440 "" i don't think neither.. and ALL REST IS PLASTIC for handle. they have this illing green side oval on side of handle. BIG & ugly.. spend 20.00 and get yourself s & w 890."
1,Stay away from Sandlot2,"We LOVED Sandlot and rushed out to buy Sandlot2. This movie is horrible. The storline is horrible, the plot is horrible, the acting is horrible and the language is unnecessary and horrible. The story leaves the opening for Sandlot3 which will probably be horrible if written by the same people. This is not the sequel we expected. This is not a baseball movie. If you grew up with Sandlot, DO NOT PURCHASE THIS MOVIE !!"
1,Bad rip off of the first,I think the whole point of the sandlot 2 was to sort of re create the first one. how much stuff did they use in this movie that was exactly like sandlot 1? almost everything. except the part with the girls joining the team. the whole thing with the rocket ship was so... stupid is the only word that pops into my head. i cant stand the actors in this movie or anything about this movie. not recommended. especially to fans of the first one. it just leaves you with a lot of anger inside as the credits roll down.
3,Pretty Good!!!,"When I was a kid, I had always wanted a sequel to The Sandlot. I got half my wish. It is a sequel, but the only person to return was James Earl Jones as Mr. Mertle. It's basically a remake, but with a few similarities to the original. 10 years after retrieving the Babe Ruth baseball, a new group of kids play at the sandlot. David Durango is the leader of the group, and one day they see Johnny Smalls and think he is there to tamper with the sandlot. After the guys are forced to team up with girls, Johhny launches a rocket that is the future of NASA and the United States space program built by Haley's dad and lands right into Mr. Mertle's backyard. Mr. Mertle has another vicious dog, and the group try just about everything to get the rocket back. I'd probably recommend THE SANDLOT 2!!!"
1,It's Disgraceful!!!,"NO!!!! This is a disgrace! It's an abomination to the original. Some movies should not have sequals. The Sandlot is one of them. It's the same exact story, except without the magic. I don't know if I should laugh or cry. I cried. I was horrified when i heard about this movie, but thats nothing compared to the shame i felt as i watched this movie. this is punishment to all 90's kids like me. Young or old, don't see this movie...."
1,How is this a sequel??,This is not a sequel to Sandlot.. It's a HORRIBLE remake.. the scenes are almost exactly the same but cheesier.. blech.. I can't believe they tried to murder the original. Shame on whoever made this.
1,Don't Spoil the Original By Watching this Tripe,"The first film was very good. Unfortunately, this movie is so very bad that it may harm your good impression of the original. Avoid it."
1,sandlot 2 as bad as 3 ninjas high at mega mountain,"I've never seen this. I was going to give it a chance by renting it, but holy crap. My brother said that he would blow chunks if he saw five minutes of it. (I don't like chunks!) I hope it's better than I think (It can't be worse.) The sandlot 1, one, uno, was the best basball movie ever made. If they are going to make a sequal at least make it good. Durango isn't a name for a leader. I thought Durangos were the enemys you fight in Zelda games (Maybe some sort of chips). WHY WHY WHY WHY WHY WHY do they hate us so? They should at least get some of the original kids to star somewhere. If this movie comes on t.v I will try and watch it.P.S they look like they are all playing softball not baseball.P.S.S What the heck kind of name is FEAR ;k,',/,.k'jk TardP.S.S.S Dare I say that it's as bad as 3 ninjas high at mega mountain"
1,Bad for kids,"This sandlot movie is the worst. The most terrible thing about it is that is has swears, like hell, the sh!# word, and the a!# word!It is SO not for children! If you have kids, don't watch it in front of them. This sandlot movie is for kids 13 or under. You wouldn't want your kids to get the wrong message. I am just saying this to let you know that Sandlot 1 was better because it had no swears in it. The director of this movie was insane! He was probably thinking, ""Aw, who cares?! I don't care if this movie has bad stuff in it! I don't care if kids learn swears and start saying them around the house!""If you let your children watch this movie, you are SO dumb!"
1,This is horrible.,"I'm so disgusted that some idiot would EVER make a sequel to The Sandlot. The Sandlot was the best movie ever made, I've never met a single person who doesn't love it. They should have just quit while they were ahead! I refuse to even watch this movie, nobody should ever mess with a classic like The Sandlot. Also, even though I am a girl, I'm still angry that they added girls to the team just to be politically correct or whatever. As everyone else has said, the original team never would have played with a girl. The only thing about this movie that is in the least bit respectable is that they brought James Earl Jones back to play Mr. Mertle. Other then that, this is a disgrace to the original movie."
1,One Of The Worst Films I Have Ever Seen,"This film is terrible. It's practically a reamake with no magic unlike the original. ""The Beast"" scenes are awefully flat, the acting's crap, the idea is completely uninventive, and the characters are annoying and whiney. Skip it."
1,Was this a Baseball movie?,For a baseball move it sure didn't have a lot of baseball in it (maybe less then 10 mins worth).I never understood the point of making a sequel if you're not going to change the plot. It was basically a remake of the original and a really bad remake at that.Pretend this movie was never made and go watch the original (you'll be happy you do)
2,Sandlot 2,I would not recommend this DVD. My grand children and I loved the original. Watched it 20 times. Sandlot 2 has the same plot and it is very predictable. THe cast has changed and It has its moments but I would not buy it again.
2,Just a Special Feature,"This dvd may be good for fans of the original movie only because of the Special Feature ""Sandlot Kids: Then and Now"" which has interviews and behind the scenes shots of the original films cast.For a better follow up story to ""The Sandlot"" I'd recommend the recently released ""Sandlot 3 Heading Home""."
3,Not as good as original,"This is an okay movie, but not as good as the original. However, grandchildren enjoyed it. I would recommend it as a family movie."
4,Fantastic family movie!,"The reviews for the movie are really harsh, too harsh in my opionon. It is a lovely movie with an even more lovable cast! The movie is about a group of kids spending their summer having fun, getting into trouble, and of course playing baseball. The special features on the dvd are really good too. The director's commentary was very fun and informative. The behind the scenes feature was really adorable, the kids looked like they were having a blast. Also there was a lot of homages to the first Sandlot movie which was nice. And to the baseball fans out there, interviews of major league baseball players was on the dvd. Please please don't write this movie off!"
1,Part 2 of review 1 (may 3 2005... with 1 star as well),The directer made a sequel and a remake at the same time!!! whats up with that!? by the way this movie will stink... I have not seen it yet but its quite obvious. check my other review as it says in my title... SANDLOT I RULED!! WHY RUIN IT?????
1,The Sandlot 2 = Blehhhh,"Besides a sequel being unnecessary, the fact that at the end of The Sandlot, the characters are at least in their late 20s/early 30s makes this sequel even more laughable. I've never seen this and never will. Avoid it like the plague and stick to The Sandlot.As for the idea of a sequel, I quote Squints from the first Sandlot:""If you'da been thinkin', you wouldn't 'a thought that."""
1,Bad language,"There's a lot of bad language and name-calling in this film. We watched a few minutes of it and then canned it. It was a gift, but too bad. We work really hard to teach our children to behave well and treat others with respect, so I don't want their entertainment to teach them otherwise."
1,Ridiculous,"Ok, so we all know the plot line of the first one, a baseball signed by Babe Ruth is hit into the guys yard, but he has this huge dog that everyone is scared of. So they try all these ways to get the ball back, only to have figure out that the owner of the house is really awesome if you just go talk to him..... So what gets me about this sequel is why didnt Scotty Smalls tell his little brother ""hey if you ever hit anything over the fence, just go talk to Mr. Mirtle, because he is really awesome"" It is just a stupid plot line, and there are rumors circulating that there might be 4 more sequels? I don't know if thats true, but what a waste of film. The kid with the afro on the front cover has sandals, who plays baseball, plus if you look at it, there is only 7 kids, not a very good cover, which matches because im sure it wont be a very good movie"
1,You have seen this movie 10 years ago,"I was lucky to watch a Sandlot marathon on the bus when I was going to a field trip. Having loved the original, I was dying to see part 2. Unfortunatly, this movie just wasted my time. The plot is basicaly the same, the jokes and sequences are mostly the same, the dog part is exactly the same, the arguements are still the same...This is almost the same exact thing as Sandlot 1 but the only thing different is that there are girls and new characters. Please, only see one of these movies. If you haven't seen the first Sandlot, I reccomend this. If you have seen the first one already, stay away from this cr*p. Don't expect much out of this Sandlot 2. I really hate this and so would anyone else who has seen the first. I say buy the original and only rent this one if you really have to. Other wise, it's trash."
1,nothing like the oringinal,the director shouldint have made a part two in the oringinal everything that needed to be said was said already there was no need for part two this movie sucked on ice and it wasint even funny and it wasint even entertaining its was nothing if i had a choice i woulding even have given it the one star this movie dosent even deserve that if you wanna see a REAL baseball movie watch the sandlot the ORINGINAL one
1,"About as lame as modern day Looney Tunes, or Tom and Jerry.","Caddyshack II, Grease II, Jaws II, Sting II, Exorcist II, Robocop II, Sandlot II. Any questions? This is as focussed group a movie as there is. Let's include girls in this one!!"
1,Horrible!,"This movie is a politically correct brainwashing using the original as a prop. The original was a classic - right up there with ""A Christmas Story"" and ""Princess Bride."" This movie is the worst acting, worst storyline, worst sequel I've ever experienced!"
2,Sandlot 2,"This is a good movie, not near as good as the phenomenal Sandlot. It is basically a lame replica of the original Sandlot. Is entertaining when nothing to do i watched this movie about 4 times ona camping trip with younger kids who enjoyed it, i stayed around because of the hottie in the movie; Max Lloyd-Jones who plays David Durango."
4,Fun movie,"This movie was a lot of fun, and I really enjoyed it. I don't understand why so many of the reviewers are knocking this film. People get too wrapped up in over-analyzing and nitpicking everything instead of just enjoying a movie for what it is: A light-hearted, good time.Also, to the reviewer ""Bud"", the first Sandlot film does have some minor swearing in it: Benny ""The Jet"" says Sh*t when the Beast comes over the fence, and there was some name calling between the sandlot kids and the little league team. A movie will not cause kids to swear any more than a heavy metal record will cause violence or drug use. Please. Kids hear worse things in school, at home, and on tv. Enjoy the film."
5,Simply Sampatico... a great cookbook,"A favorite of mine. My first introduction to this book was on a trip to Albuquerque many, many years ago. Since then, I have purchased 6 of these books and given 5 as gifts. Great recipes.One thing that I particularly like about this book, which may be a surprise to some, is that not all the old fashioned *fat* ingredients have not been taken out of the recipes, and the book not entirely updated to reflect low fat ""healthy"" foods. I like to eat healthy but once in a while a good, old fashioned recipe with the yummy bad ingredients is just plain good. You can easily eliminate fats yourself but I enjoy the authentic recipes. I can modernize them myself.Love this book."
5,Wonderful Concert And Behind The Scenes,"Bernie, along with many of music's top players, make for a wonderful video. The video has great music, emotional moments and alot of energy. Mayor Giuliani is terrific as the host."
3,Too Loud,"The pump works,but it is too loud. I suggest ear plugs when using this product. I have a pump which works with a car, but I thought this would be handy for home use. My car pump is not as loud."
1,"LOUD, LOUD, LOUD","Not sure if all pumps are this loud...but goodness this one is so loud it hurt my ears...also the attachments that come with it (for different size holes) are not affixed to the pump so you have to hold the attachments on the blower while it is filling up the item and the cord is not on the side of the pump, it's on the bottom so you cannot even set the pump down while it is inflating the item. It is just a bit awkward. I used it to blow up an inflatable Castle for my 20 month old and there are several areas to blow up and some of them are a bit awkward and trying to hold the pump AND hold the attachments on the pump with one hand was a bit aggrevating."
1,Incredibly loud!,"The pump works well enough, but it produces a horribly houd screeching motor sound. It terrified all the children--definitely not worth it!!"
3,Certainly Loud,"I have this item and agree with the rest of the reviews. It is definitely loud. However, it did the job for the inflatable pool toys and air bed. I decided to purchase a rechargeable one though so I dont have to be confined to one spot."
3,OMG so loud,"It works, but soooooo loud. My daughter(2 y.o.) freaked when we used this to fill her inflated castle. Not pleasant for grownups either."
2,Terriblemente Ruidosa,"La bomba realmente es muy ruidosa, al punto que cuando esta en operación es imposible escuchar si una persona se dirije a usted.Las boquillas no se mantienen en su lugar y, o bien, usted sujeta bomba y boquilla durante el inflado o se ve forzado a suspender continuamente el proceso para recolocar las boquillas."
3,A little disappointed,"I have had this vacuum for about 8 months now. It sounds like it has a lot of power. I contacted Emer and complained about how little the vacuum actually was picking up. It seems that the tools are very poorly constructed. They sent me a new handle and vacuum tool at no charge to me. That was very impressive. This tool works much better that the original ones, but I am still pretty disappointed on how much this vacuum actually picks up. When I take the tool off of the top of the hose, there is plenty of suction. However, so far, every tool that I have used with this vacuum does a very poor job of actually picking up dirt, etc. I believe that there is a very expensive tool that I can purchase, but I just can't afford to spend that much on a new tool. Unfortunately, I would not recommend this vacuum, even tho the customer service is very good."
4,Hiking Kauai,This book was an excellent resource for the hiking trails around Kauai. The detail was excellent.
3,"Hiking Kauai, the Garden Isle",Leaves something to be desired as compared to other hiking books on Kauai.
5,"Simple, Informative Fun to Read Gardening Guide","This is the first gardening book I've encountered that's easy and fun to read, yet just as educational is your garden-variety how-to garden book. You'll see yourself in the many humorous personal anecdotes about learning by trial and error to become a confident gardener. This book is geared to beginners but is also a great, handy up-to-date gardening reference for the experienced gardener. I recommend it for people who want an attractive yard but who don't have time for exhaustive research or a lot of work to make it look that way. The book presents useful information about working with the climate, soil and yard that you have instead of fighting Mother Nature. There are lots of tips for plant selection, watering, lawn care, planting tricks, composting, etc. A great gift for someone about to start their very first garden."
4,Awesome poses,"I love it.. great addition to my desk. Great paint, and good detail. It has great articulation."
2,1994. I guess I should have expected this,"This is so obviously from the mid nineties. I'm unimpressed by the manufacturing quality. Current revoltechs are much more attractive and solid in construction. This guy has seam lines all over the place and is just not really what I wanted. I returned it. It was shipped promptly and for free though, which was nice. I still had to pay return shipping and a 10% reshelving fee. It's okay though. I replace it with a Robot Damashii Zegapain Altaire. Neat!"
3,"Another""OMEN""sounding knock-off","Richard Band,who writes music mainly for schlocky third rate horror movies wrote the score for this confused inquisitional movie..Given that it is alledgedly""based""on the Edgar Allen Poe story,the film,as it unreels shows no association whatsoever with Poe,except for the fact that a pendulum torture scene is included.Band's score ,like the award-winning score for the original,Gregory Peck-Lee Remick version of ""The Omen"" has an ominous chorus chanting""Satani""and so forth in latin,along with some rather sinister sounding gregorean chanting,and the usual terror/suspense cues...The film has to do with Torquemeda,the inquisitor,and has a lot of torture and brutality,perpetrated mainly on a pretty young woman(playing an accused witch)who is either nude or semi-nude"
2,I was surprisingly disappointed,"Though there were some touching moments in the story, I found this novel to be rather boring and not in the usual style of Robin Jones Gunn. She is my favorite author, and the high standard to which I hold her novels was not met with this one. I was thrilled to find ""Gardenias for Breakfast"" on the bookstore shelf last week! But as I got further and further into the story, I kept waiting for it to get better. Perhaps I didn't appreciate it as much as a mother would (I do not have children).For me, this novel was weak and disappointing. It cannot hold a candle to her Glenbrooke and Sisterchicks series."
4,Great storage option,I bought 2 of these coat racks and love them. They look great and were easy to hang.
4,"Great book, Great video","I had already read the book (2 versions actually) and wanted the DVD specifically to share with a friend who probably wouldn't read the book, plus as a quick reminder of the many important items of health. The things the books and DVD about healthy aging and just plain healthy living are no-nonsense, easy-to-understand facts. It's a good book to keep around and refer to at least once a year."
1,"A cheap, plantation, redneck, ""CARRIE""","Hmmm, this was a horrible novel. It's like rich, plantation owner, meets a ""carrie white"" from backwoods alabama. It is horribly unoriginal, written on a second graders reading level...the most complicated word was probably telekinesis...however, the deaths were slightly exciting."
4,NICE PROGRAM,For a digital dj like my self i have no complaints about this program i am currently testing it out in beta and its fabulous. i cant wait till it comes out on the market i will be the first 1 in line. i am extatic about this program.
4,alot of fun songs and jams,despite having a very strong michael jackson&prince influence in there music this band was able to groove during the 80's and maintain there juice. oh shelia is still the jam and i've always dug long time coming.and they were self-contained unit did there own writting and producing.
5,Wonderful Dictionary,"This dictionary is a great resource for anyone learning or translating between German and English. The included IPA is a definite bonus, as it explains how to correctly pronounce the words!"
1,Movie has no sound!!!,Movie mode has no sound. Why would anyone want to record a movie with no sound??? It's ridiculous!!! I shipped it back to Amazon. Bought a Canon instead.
1,Not delivered,DHL deliver the product in a different direction to the direction of delivery and the product is lost
4,Buen producto,"Realmente yo no conocia la camara y aunque el tamaño fue un poco mas grande que el esperado, creo que la funcionalidad es muy buena y su precio todavia mejor."
5,real easy to use!,"This is a great little camera, so easy to use, and great for anyone who ever moved even a slight bit while taking a picture. This camera has awesome stabilization! Real easy to hook up to your computer too!"
3,Digital Camera Basic,"Was OK for our purposes at first, but now after more than six months something seems to have gone with the optics and all the pics it takes are blurry. Might claim on warranty. Not great for wide angle or large group shots."
4,Great little camera but more complex than I expected,"I wanted a small point and shoot camera for taking pictures while we are out and about. Tired of lugging a big heavy camera. I also wanted to get a good price. This camera is great for the price and small and light enough. The only problem is that it's not an easy point and shoot. You have to put it on the right setting to get a decent picture and change the settings frequently based on what your photographing. Settings are not as simple as setting the dial either. But once you get a hang of it, it's not so bad. It downloads pics easily and has a decent battery life. It wasn't the perfect camera for me but it is a very good camera."
4,Great Stuff!,"Great DVD compilation of Leon Errol's shorts. This man was one of the true ""funnymen"" of all time. He looks funny, he acts funny, he walks and talks funny. Some people are comics, some are comedians, Leon Errol is just naturally funny. His reactions are priceless and makes me wish there were still comedies being made that really make you laugh out loud. Not grin, not chuckle, but laugh. The only reason I didn't rate it at 5 stars was the picture quality of some of the prints are poor. But to have them at all is a blessing. I know he must have made hundreds of these shorts....more please."
4,"""The Average Man"" can be way-above average fun!","As of 9/09, this was the only available DVD package of Edgar Kennedy's ""Average Man"" shorts. The set is flawed only because his earliest classic work gets little representation here. Like Laurel & Hardy, Mr. Kennedy's funniest two-reelers were all created before 1937.The supporting cast (Edgar's family) changed a bit from the series' 1931 inception until its 1948 finish. For example, Florence Lake was the ideal flighty mile-a-minute talking wife, while Sally Payne, seen briefly in the early 1940s, took a different approach to the Mrs. Kennedy role. In these years, Irene Ryan (Granny on THE BEVERLY HILLBILLIES) also appeared in some of Edgar's comedies.Note that Florence Lake did return to the cast after a few years' hiatus and stayed with the series to its conclusion. However, her yammering scatterbrain is most exuberant in the first few dozen productions."
4,A good album given the circumstances,"One of the many dual-entertainers more known and respected for his acting rather than his singing, Philip Michael Thomas of Miami Vice fame made of couple of albums in the 80s that are solid if not spectacular, bringing a bit of the suave and cool aura of that show to his music. Though not a hugely talented singer (there are many 80s soul men who have deeper, more authoritative voices), the polished, synth-heavy production on this album is so well done that it almost makes the quality of his voice irrelevant, and his easy-going style actually fits quite well into these settings, whereas people like Luther Vandross or Teddy Pendergrass (for all of their greatness), probably would sound out of place here. Highlights include the funky ""Just The Way I Planned It,"" the soft and haunting ""Everything Happens In Its Own Time,"" and the sunny-sounding, beach-flavored ""Stay (In My Loving Arms Tonight)."""
2,"I love her not, I love her, I love her not...","The writing was dull, the characters were unreal. Since nothing much happened (apart from a lot of indecisiveness) and absolutely nothing was resolved (who took the dog, who was the dead guy in the alley, did Abdullah actually die, is Howard gay) there must be a moral to the story. What is it? ""That one must feel a lot of guilt if one accidentally kills an intruder?"" Ok, I'll try to remember that... It was compelling enough to read to the end, so 2 stars."
2,The Tremor of Indecision,"Howard Ingham is an American writer in Tunisia, sent there to write a movie script. Luckily he has received a large advance and is staying in a hotel waiting for the arrival of the actors and director/cameraman. He's also waiting for a letter from his girlfriend Ina. Unfortunately, before he arrives, the director commits suicide after a short affair with Ina, but Howard stays on in Tunisia, unable to get going with his life. He makes various and assorted friends and Ina travels from New York to visit him. He decides he's crazy in love with her, then decides he isn't. He defends himself against a burglar, then is made to feel guilty about it. Howard can't really decide how he feels. I know how I felt: bored. Every meal, every can of beer is described.There is one good thing: the dog comes back!"
2,Not impressed,"This was my first Patricia Highsmith novel, and I have to say that I was not impressed. From all that I've heard about Highsmith being one of the great mystery and suspense writers, this book did not live up to her reputation. The story seemed to just muddle along. I was hoping for a plot with more depth, but was disappointed."
3,So so..,It's okay doesn't clear any dark spots from ingrown hair.. But eliminates ingrown hair while using!! Could be better but it's okay
4,Skin,"This items works very well and I am completely satisfied with product and how it works after shaving,Use it after shaving and it does not burn to much because of alcohol content"
3,Works Okay For Me,"Tend Skin Tend Skin 2.5 oz Refillable Roll OnIs NOT 100% Effective, But It Works ""Okay"" For Me, As It Has DEFINITELY Lessened The Occurrence Of My Razor Bumps, And The Ones That DO Appear, Go Through A 2 Day ""Whitehead-Phase"", Before Disappearing Completely.I've Read The Reviews That Mention The Terrible Smell, But One Shouldn't Be Surprised, Considering The MainIngredients (Of 22) Are Acetylsalicylate (Aspirin), And Alcohol;However, I Actually Prefer It This Way, Since I'd Rather Apply My OWN Fragrance To Take Care Of The Smell, Than Have The Product-Makers Try To Mask It Themselves, By Adding A Fragrance That May Be Just As Unpleasant, Or Simply NOT To One's Personal Taste."
5,FANTASTIC!!,i would constantly get ingrown hairs and bumps on my neck after shaving... NOT ANYMORE!After using this i rarely see any bumps ... great product. will continue to buy.
3,"Helpful, but might jsut be rubbing alcohol.","This did help ingrown hairs along my bikini line, but I am fairly sure the same result could be reached by using rubbing alcohol."
4,Help with HS,Bought this product as recommended by bloggers on the HS website. Using in combo with other products and it is working. Also used it for it's sole purpose and it works.
5,Amazing!,"This stuff really works. For me, underarm ingrown are the worst. This liquid helped immensely. Definitely not magical though:( Like pretty much any product, you have to use it every day in order for it to work."
4,Good price,"Got a great price on the 16oz size. Prices on this item aren't as competitive as in the past, so I was glad to find it here. FYI--this item also makes a great deodorant."
3,"Not great, but ok",Although the product works well. The roll on is nothing to bring home to mom. It doesn't quite roll therefore you have to press very hard against your head and face to get it to roll. Even then it doesn't roll very well. But what you gonna do? If there is a better way to apply this product please let me know.
2,Boring,"Another tedious excersise in the murder-mystery genre of adventure gaming..What starts of as a classy interpretation of the classic novel quickly devolves into your typical wandering item/conversation ""what's next"" unengaging gameplay, which given it's one location will no doubt have players running around and eventually becoming bored at looking at the already static backgrounds..Only for hardcore mystery fans, people who liked the sherlock holmes, or hitchcock games.."
2,This is ridiculous,"If we hadn't found an on-line cheat page on this game, we'd never have gotten through it. The entire fifth chapter is a ridiculous joke - get rotten apples, make cider (but first find the parts for the cider press) and feed it to the goats to get past the thistles? Who on Earth would think of doing that on their own? The flashlight batteries in the flour was another unheard of puzzle. Both my boyfriend and I are intelligent, college-educated people, but there is no way, without help, we would have figured that one out.Ridiculous.And after that chapter? The entire game takes about ten minutes.Figuring out whodunnit? We knew very early on.Nowhere near as good a tribute to the great book as it could have been. I'm very disappointed; we won't be playing again."
1,"If it worked, it may have been great!","I received the game in the mail and greatly looked forward to playing it. It came with a copy of the classic novel, which was the only thing that functioned properly. I e-mailed the company. They promptly e-mailed me asking me to resend the details of the resultant error messages. I have done so repeatedly with zero further acknowledgement."
2,Rating For The Software,"This game seemed like it was going to be exellent when i read about it.Well i got to play about fifteen minutes of it.I dont know if my copy had a glitch.The game would shut down everytime.Im taking back the game as soon as a go back to the store.My computer met all the requirements .As for the game that far,Pros:The story was great.It was set up to be a really great mystery.Cons:Besides softare problems.The game moved about really slowly.It took forever to get from point a to b.The game was a bit confusing.I really had no idea what to do.You basicaly run around collecting clues,that really made no sense.Maybe if the game would have stayed running longer i would have liked it.Im going to try and avoid software from this company in the future."
4,Need a help web site,"This game is fun, but when you get stuck, you have to completely start over. It would be cool if there was a place to go for hints or tips like a web site or something, so that you could avoid having to re-do everything."
4,"Cool game, some flaws","This game is pretty good. I've never read the Agatha Christie novel but this game does a pretty good job of telling the story, I was pretty engrossed in it. I thought the environments were done pretty well even if they were prerendered but they were too static. The character models were merely satisfactory. This game can get a bit repetitive at times though and for some reason this game made my graphics card jump to 110 degrees Celsius, I had to underclock it to get it to a cooler temperature and this game doesn't really use much 3D, just a bunch of 2D images and character models!"
2,Fun game - but a nightmare to install!,"Beware - I was shipped (TWICE) a bad build of this software, with the two discs containing different versions. Amazon was nice in replacing my copy, but the replacement had the same problem. It took nearly two months to straighten it out with the publisher, after many hours were invested in trying to ""fix"" my ""computer"".If you can get this installed, though, the game is fun to play, with most puzzles being not so easy as to be trivial, but not so hard that I have to run for a hint guide. There are a few issues with continuity (characters mention story elements I haven't encountered yet, etc) and realism - spatial relationships are confused/jumpy and lead to distracting gameplay, and sometimes make you miss evidence you need to solve a puzzle. However, it's an engrossing game that follows the book (the full original text is included!) very closely while changing the ending enough to make it a detective adventure. Worth the time & money invested."
1,this is not a hidden object game. its ridiculus.,this is a bad whatever game. the book helps yet your character is running around like a nut. game makes zero sence. i quit after 20 minutes of running in and out of rooms. do not waste your money like i got stung.
1,Save your money for a different game,"I like adventure games but they screwed this one up. It's a good concept but unlike Syberia or other good adventure games, this game just didn't turn out well. I put mine in the wastebasket tonight(seriously) without even finishing it; it simply isn't worth the time."
2,Cannot Understand the Good Reviews,"I'm not a big gamer but once in a while I'm intrigued by a title and I pick it up. The last adventure game I bought was ""Runaway - A Road Adventure"" which I enjoyed a lot.I can't same this same for this game. In fact I found it so dull I only made it through the 2nd chapter and quit playing it. The graphics (especially the human characters) are crude. The game play consists of picking up seemingly endless inventory items (really, it was ridiculous) and quizzing the other characters by asking them the same questions over and over so I trigger the next scene in the game.I would not recommend this at all. The old King's Quest games of the 1980s were far more entertaining than this!"
2,Played like an interactive audio book,"I enjoy mystery and adventure games, so I expected to enjoy this game. This is one of the least fun games I've ever played. Most of the 'puzzles' in the game are impossible to figure out without a hint (because they are absurd), and then once you do figure them out are completely irrelevant to the game. In fact, all you really must do to complete this game is to talk to everyone over and over and over. There is an incredible amount of talking, none of which can be skipped and much of which isn't neccessary. I was very disapointed. It starts with 10 people and kills them off from there 'chapter' by 'chapter'. I had hoped that each 'chapter' would have puzzles that would produce clues so that it would be possible to figure out who the killer was. In reality, the clues are so obscure that they can only be seen in retrospect.I would only reccommed this game if you are more interested in listening to a story than solving a mystery or playing a game."
4,Just a lot of fun!,"I'm a mystery/thriller book reading fiend and am always on the lookout for new version of mystery entertainment. I thoroughly enjoyed spending some rainy afternoons immersed in And Then There Were None. I have read the book and seen every screen variation of this mystery ever produced, and I still found playing this game a whole lot of fun. I just wish the gaming industry would produce more similar products. If you are a mystery fan, this game is for you. The gaming techniques are very easy to pick up and if you get stumped, there are loads of ""hint"" sites on the internet to provide help. Highly recommend."
5,A GREAT SELECTION OF THEIR BEST SONGS,THIS WAS EXACTLY WHAT I EXPECTED. I APPRECIATE ALL THE TRACKS. IT'S CLASSIC 50'S & 60'S LOVE SONGS!
5,PERFECT,Very enjoyable and relaxing. Love every song on this cd. I forgot how really good this group is. Takes you back to better times.
4,"Enjoyable story, rich detail, a bit predictable","Who needs fantasy when real civilizations have been so diverse? Park's book brings medieval Korea to life through the eyes of two young brothers, one a talented kite maker, the other a skilled flyer. The story never set my pulse racing (which is the only reason I don't give it 5 stars --- I'm fond of thrillers), but hundreds of little details that make the boys' lives different from ours, yet the same, are effortlessly conveyed."
4,Great book for learning about Korean culture,Great book for young boys (8-10 yrs) for learning about Korean culture and brotherhood. My son wanted to read more Linda Sue Park.
3,The Kite Fighters,"Kite Fighters is a really good book if you like just to sit and read. Not a good book to read out loud. Short story about China and two brothers that make a kite for the king, and the king all right I said enough you will just have to read the book to find out.By, Aaron A 6th grader From Maine"
4,"Good video, not enough wrestling","The Three Faces of Foley was a great look at the mind of Mick Foley, his three in-ring personalities, his friendship with Terry Funk, and of course the Hell in a Cell match of 1998. However, if you are looking for a video that highlights the wrestling career of Mick Foley, look elsewhere. This video had three matches in it. The hell in a cell, a no holds barred match with the Funker, and a falls count anywhere with HHH. It included some briefs clips of matches as Dude Love and Mankind. I would have given this video a definite five stars if there were more highlights. However, after watching this video, I definitely gained a great deal of respect for Mick Foley, the greatest of all time."
5,Foley Is Fun!,"this is a very nicely done video of Dude Love, Cactus Jack, and Mankind. the interview with JR is funny too when Mankind gives him the Mandible Claw and pretends it wasnt him. if youre bored and feeling pity of you unmeaningly exicstence then take a small bit of humpferd of believing that somewhere out there in this crazy mixed-up universe of ours there's still a little but cool video called Three Faces of Foley"
5,The best WWF Video ever made!!!!!,"DAMN DAMN good video. A compilation of Mick's WWF career. The video is narrated by Mick himself, very candidly. The video is highlighted by PWI's match of the year, and in my opinion, the match of the millenium, the ""Hell in the Cell."" BUY THIS VIDEO!!!!!"
5,The Truth Behind the Hardest Worker in Wrestling,This was a great video that showed just how much of a hard worker Mick Foley really was. I never got to see his interview with Jim Ross but understand how the fan's changed their attitudes towards him after that!
1,My ears are bleeding,"This is quite possibly the worst childrens' DVD I have ever seen. The visuals are awful, the singing is out-of-key, and there are no lyrics on-screen so that your children can follow along. My two-year old looked at me during the third song and said ""No like it."" Thank goodness this was a garage-sale gift from my mother. Please, for the love of all that is holy, do not waste your money on any of this company's products."
1,"Not Karaoke for kids,","This is NOT an entertaining or educational alternative to TV. You could not ""sing-a-long"" because there aren't any lyrics at the bottom of the screen. This is a boring collection of home videos with annoying music added. The children in the video look like they would rather be doing something else (one is sleeping on the couch). The video has strange and random characters like a lady with a neon pink dress who dances and blows kisses and two unknown costumed characters who ride a golf cart and chase kids. One of the adults looks like she just got out bed to relunctantly play pat-a-cake. The video looks like it was put together with a minimum amount of thought, effort, and money."
4,Good tool,It's nice to find an ESOL book with relevant topics like jobs and children with several different exercises for the adult learner. Nice presnetation.
5,Hindsight into foresight,"I have read the Tanner book also.It was an eye opener as to the kindness and depravity of peoples.I wish history had been this interesting in school. I think I learned more from this book and Andrew Durnford , another Daudert book,than I did in any history or sociology class.Both books gave me history lessons that I didn't get in school.The transparency that they provide into life of a different time is exemplary!These reading let me see that my views of human nature are not too obscure!"
5,Great Product,"I am new to the world of midi. I had previously purchased some midi software that was simply horrible, it was in no way friendly to those who are new to midi, the midi cord i had obtained also did not work. This package however, is very nice. its simple and easy to use. It even has an instruction booklet(instead of a card telling you how you can purchase an instruction booklet). Also included is a working midi cable, which is a nice touch for those of us who do not wish to purchase one separatly. There is, of course, better software out there, but if you are new to world of midi, this is a great place to start. this package is affordable (some software can go up to hundreds of dollars), complete (i have yet to see a midi software package that comes with an instruction booklet and a midi cord (the cards telling you to purchase a sams teach yourself whatever in 24 hours are really annoying), and its really easy to use. A great product for a great price!"
3,"Holds down shirt, holds up socks, tabs get lost though.","This is a good product, but it can take a little while to hook it up to your shirt and socks.It makes dress shirts stay tucked in and you'll look sharp. Unfortunately, the tab design is flimsy and once you lose the tab, they don't really work and you'll have to buy another pair."
3,Presenting the good Lyndon,"Dallek's biography has the virtue of being written by someone who clearly admires Johnson. As such, it is somewhat of a counterweight to Robert Caro and I suggest both be read for balance.Nevertheless, in presenting the ""good Lyndon"", Dallek downplays the worst of Johnson. There is nothing particularly wrong with this (Dallek certainly doesn't ignore the flaws, just tends to gloss over them a little), but it does lead to a fairly tepid book, one that is nowhere near as much fun to read as Caro's. Thus, if I could only read one (which of course many readers will do considering the length of both Caro's and Dallek's presentations), I would read Caro's. Caro's second and third volumes (covering the 40's and 50's, roughly the second half of the Dallek volume being discussed here) are possibly the best political biography ever written. It is against that ""competition"" that Dallek's book must be weighed and I found, in the balance, that Dallek's work is merely ordinary."
3,The soft focus version ...,"If you are a postmodern thinker and a fan of Lyndon Johnson, this is the biography for you.Dallek attempts to create the image the Johnson was pretty much like any other Texas politician of the times who came from hardscrabble poverty to politics. However, Johnson is the only one who became majority leader of the senate and later president, so one tires quickly of almost all differentiations being on the positive side. It gives the impression that Johnson prevailed because he was two dimensional (good and bad) and the rest were just evil.This is Lyndon Johnson Lite.I gave it three stars because basicly its a good read for children and adults who don't want to know negative details about their icons."
4,A great collection of Kenai history,"This book is a good collection of history and descriptions of Alaska's south-central Kenai Peninusula. It's nicely organized town by town (though it doesn't have an index), and though it's fairly deferential to the area--as if it was written by the Alaska Bureau of Tourism--it's not afraid to tell about things like the whorehouse that was until very recently right outside of Soldotna.It's full of good photos and, though it sometimes feels like a magazine in book form, is a very nice volume for fans of the Kenai to buy and treasure.I've been researching a book that I want to write on Soldotna, Alaska, and the information in this book was very helpful to me. I think anyone that lives on this peninsula, or that's visited there, would enjoy it as well."
1,DROWNING DANGER,"This stupid toy tips over VERY EASILY. It is horribly designed and nearly drowned my 3 year old last summer. You have to hold the whale upright every second, and even then your child could slip off into the water."
1,"what on earth is ""Bengali Bombay"" sauce?","Bombay (Mumbai) is in Maharashtra, the people of the area are Marathis. Bengalis are from Bangladesh and also the Indian state of West Bengal. This product has a nonsense title because they don't think their customers know better. I am not sure why they didn't add ""hunan style, great with suchi"""
4,A Clear Description of the Roman Army,"It is some time since I read the book so my memory will be playing up, hence this will be rather vague. Essentially Peddie (a retired officer in the British Army) illuminates one aspect of the Roman Army in each chapter. This ranges from the Roman equivalent of staff officers, battlefield communications, marching camp techniques, siege warfare, equipment and other points. Some of the more interesting contents are his rebuffs of what many other military historians have perceived as weaknesses or want in the Roman Army. He clearly points out how everything served a valuable purpose in the Roman Army and what many have assumed were missing were actually there in one form or another. He also draws surprising similarities between the British campaign in Burma during WWII and the Roman way of war. All in all a most satisfying and clear read, though perhaps he digresses a bit too much on some occassions."
2,A Stunning Disappointment,"After reading other customers reviews, I was really looking forward to this book, however, I found myself surprisingly dissappointed. The modern humor with which the author flavors 90% of the novel, mixed with the time period of centuries ago was not well executed, and came across as cheeky and immature. I found the combination didn't work for me at all. The book comes across as very superficial and impotent."
5,Brilliant and Irresistible,"If you're reading this review to decide whether or not to buy the book, hesitate no longer. Buy it. Daughter of the Shining Isles is destined to become a classic, with writing unsurpassed for its sheer beauty and wisdom, and a theme of real magnitude. It's also a great read, with an edge-of-your-seat page-turning plot and a completely irresistible heroine. Maeve, the Celtic Mary Magdalen, is strong, feisty, and ireeverent--self-esteem issues she has NOT got. The lippy modernity of her language is a delight, with a venerable antecedent in Shakespeare's use of anachronism. Upbeat, moving, and magical, Daugher of the Shining Isles has something for everyone. I can't praise this book highly enough."
2,"Retitled ""Magdalen Rising""","I really enjoyed reading ""Magdalen Rising"" and looked forward to reading ""Daughter of the Shining Isles"", thinking it would be yet another great book by Elizabeth Cunningham. I had just finished ""Magdalen Rising"", so you can imagine my disappointment when I opened the book to see the same story under a different title. I really hate it when publishers do this - at least give the buyer notice so we don't waste our hard earned cash on the same book under a different title! Please don't take this as a 'slam' on the book itself - under either title, you're getting a great read."
1,Blessed Be !,"Hark fellow pagan wymen ! Here be a tome of most rightious truth and beauty, consistent with the guidance of the Goddess! Herein all honor is given to the sacred moon-time flow. Blessed Be!"
2,Okay case....,"The opening in the case where the charger plugs into the phone is a bit small, this has me opening the case every time I put it to charge. The transparent plastic does not cover all the buttons, and has torn away from the main cover after a month's usage. The clip is too tight on my belt, i think a swivelling case would be better."
2,NOT good,"Once you put this on your device, it is fine, but if you move it wrong way or try to remove it - you will have to replace it."
1,It broke as soon as we took it out of the box! Why so fragile?,"I thought it was gonna be a nice durable earhook, but it didnt last 2 minutes.. and it broke by barely touching it.."
3,"Minor, easily-fixed problem when loading on itunes","It is the cd I was looking for (who couldn't use a little mullet in their Christmas season, eh?), but when I loaded it into my itunes the titles did not match up with the songs. They were all there, just in the wrong order. Everything else was fine, and it shipped in great time right before Christmas."
5,Vince Gill CD: Let There Be Peace on Earth,It's Vince Gill...what can you say but GREAT CD? The service was outstanding as it shipped from Amazon and actually shipped one day after ordering. Imagine my surprise when within 3 days after ordering it arrived. Amazon service on this rocks!
5,Vince and Christmas - Two of the most wonderful things,"What do I have to say, other than it is Vince. If you have been a fan or are just becoming a fan of Vince Gill this is a must have, especially when the Christmas season rolls around.This isn't the type of Christmas album your mother had with all boys choirs and ladies who sing too high, and it is not contemporary in the sense that the classics are ruined.There is a guitar solo of Vince playing Here Comes Santa Clause, a Christmas song I have never heard of before (the title of the cd) which he sings with his daughter, and even some original Songs about Christmas and the lose of his brother. Songs that make you want to embrace the Christmas spirit and memories of the past and never let go.An absolute must have."
2,"Good sound, horribly limited.","I can't believe I bought this. The only input on this is ONE auxiliary red/white audio input on the back of this unit, which is a huge pain, and only one yellow composite video input. HDTV has to go from your cable box/wall to the TV. I have a cable box and an XBOX 360 and this unit only allows me to connect one at a time. Also, when listening to your TV/cable/xbox through the AUX inputs you DON'T GET SURROUND SOUND! You only get the 3 front speakers (no subwoofer sound either). Surround sound only work when you play a DVD. I returning this product. I want surround sound from all my devices."
5,excellent,"I bought this because I had reviewed and found out it was good for me to buy, I do not any product without review"
4,Great Product,I had no trouble installing the system in my house. We put in a movie and it work right off the bat.So far we have nothing but good things to say about this system. We are very pleased with it's performance.
1,"""F61"" Power issues 1 month after purchase","I had my unit for 1 month before experiencing the ""F61"" many people have seen. I calling their repair shop back and forth during a period of 4 months and it seems that none of the parts that Panasonic sent them could fix the unit. To this date, I still can't get Panasonic to send me a refurbished unit. On top of that, I had to drive the unit 97 miles to the nearest repair shop. I would not recommend this product due to the terrible customer service when it comes to servicing the warranty."
1,terrible,"This is a very lousy product. You'll enjoy it for about a year if you're lucky until the 'F61' unit display lights up, then its to the trash. As far as troubleshooting or customer support for this one, you're out of luck. Hope you have a warrenty."
2,A dissapointment,"I had a Pioneer home theater system first. After 6 years it bit the dust. I decided to go cheap and get this one. I have to say to does not measure up to the old system at all.If this was my first system I probably would not be so hard on it. It works OK. But the sound is not nearly as good as my old system. After I turn it up so loud I get bad distortion out of the large speakers. My old system never did that.The remote is not easy to use. The layout is not easy to learn. This is probably due to all the different options, but sometimes less is more.If this is your first home theater you will probably be happy. But if you have had a good one and are in need of replacing it, I recommend you look at a higher end system. I have nothing against Panasonic. Have had many things of theirs I was happy with and I will continue to use thier products. This is just not one of them."
4,Decent Replacement System for small area,"I bought this system as a replacement for my BOSE Lifestyle system. My Bose was about 4 or 5 years old and I foundit was cheaper for me to sell it as is on eBay than to fix the needed problems...minor but expensive. for less of the cost of fixing I was able to get the WHOLE system. Ok, the quality of sound is not as good but for me and the size room I have it in it is just fine for me. The set up was very simple. The remote on teh other hand I think will require me to really read the manual to figure out all it can do. I did get the basics: Play, Stop, on/off. For the price, not bad at all. Looks pretty cute too."
4,Nice Home System,Works better then the Sony from a sound standpoint. I still haven't figured out how to get the sound through the TV selection (only got the DVD part to work). Instructions and set up not as clear cut as my older Sony unit!!
1,Two MAJOR drawbacks,"At the store I thought this thing was going to be great. I compared this to many other systems and it seemed to be much better. The one thing that hooked me when I bought it was that you have the capability to go wireless.FIRSTUnfortunately, the bright engineers at Panasonic decided to have the wireless home theater system operate at the same frequency as a wireless home network. So, if you are as lucky as me, don't expect to be on the internet and use your Panasonic home theater at the same time (assuming you've got the wireless addon).SECONDThis unit doesn't have any reasonable audio inputs. Very dissappointing.I'm not sure that I would have found a better deal, nonetheless I would definitely not have purchased it knowing what I know now."
1,Wrong item sent,"The details says this is for a P710. However, these filters do not fit and are not correct. The picture of the filter box is also correct but that is not what is sent. I contacted the seller but received no response. Do Not Buy for P710!"
1,was sent wrong item,The filters I ordered were for a Ryobi cordless hand held vac. What arrived were filters for a Vista cordless hand held vac
5,Exciting!,"This story was fast paced and extremely entertaining. The plot had enough action, suspense and romance to satisfy any reader. The Carribean setting made for an excellent backdrop to an already exciting story. If you liked this book another I can recommend that is similar to this is Jimmy Buffet's Where is Joe Merchant. Both are an excelent read."
4,My daughter loves it,"My daughter has the regular barbie version of this radio, and she has had it for a year now and still loves to play the ""pretend"" tapes and cds. I find it a bit annoying, but I hear it all the time and it got old for me. It is pretty durable, my two kids play with it often nothing has broken. Perfect for a 2 1/2-3 year old. My daughter is now four and would like a real radio but I think she will still play with this one even after she gets a real one."
1,Lacks detailed order of battle information,"While providing a decent account of the battle, the order of battle part of the book lacks information on unit strengths and artillery types. This seems to be typical of the Osprey American Civil War campaign books. Including individual regimental/brigade/division strengths and the types and numbers of cannon in the artillery batteries would have made purchasing this book worthwhile. That sort of information for American Civil War battles is usually not available on the internet. With most of the information included in this book available for free on the internet, I do not need to spend my money to purchase this book and the others on the American Civil War from this series for the pictures."
4,Large Print Roget's II Thesaurus,"Great book for elementary school kids who need a Theasurus and have a hard time reading the standard very small print Thesauruses. Easy to find the desired word. Because of the large print size, it is not as exhaustive (3500 entries) compared to other standard Thesauruses."
3,it is too basic,"there is nothing wrong with this book as a real introductory book for Access at such low price, but I guess anyone who want to buy an Access book need sth more in depth. I would personally recommend Access for Dummies, which is the second book I bought for self-study."
4,very well done,"Really some top notch players from the L.A. studio scene. It took me a couple of listenings before I realized, this is pretty finished. The arrangements, though slightly commercial, were cool with excellent musicianship. Nice string arrangements also."
4,Good deal for the price,"Like the last poster they are cheap but they are perfect for practicing throw skills, and come with dull edges so gripping the blade with a hammer grip isnt a problem. The sheath on the other had is pretty bad but good enough for what they are.Also if you bend the tips up just hammer back or use some pliers.Matt in Fl"
2,Three 7-1/4 in. Black Throwing Knives w/ Sheath,"These are good practice throwing knives.You can beat on them & they bend & bend back very easily.I would reccomend buying a couple of sets of these until you get the hang of it.That way when you're ready for serious throwing,you won't damage your quality throwers.Cheaply made.Low price.You get what you pay for.Good for beginners.Happy Shopping!JR in NJ"
4,Austin vs. McMahon Review,"This is an excellent look at the feud between Stone Cold and Vince McMahon, from the Raw after the D-Generation X PPV (Stone Cold beating the Rock to retain the IC belt), to the Fully Loaded End of an Era First Blood match. Most of the feud is looked at, like the hospital attack, and Stone Cold taking Vince hostage on the Raw after the Judgement Day PPV. The only thing that keeps it from getting a perfect 5 rating is that it doesn't take a look at all the feud (there's nothing about the parts of the feud between King of the Ring '98 and Breakdown '98, and the Greater Power plot isn't looked at much), but it is still a great buy."
3,Austin vs McMahon-The Whole Untrue Story.,This vhs was way too short and only showed short clips of matches.The matches were not shown in its full content which really sucked.This tape is a definite waste of money and if you want the true Austin-McMahon rivalry you probably would of had to watch Raw from 1997-present to see their real whole true story.
4,Austin -vs- McMahon WWF Home Video,"If anyone is a fan of the WWF then this video is a must have. It chronicles the whole feud between the Rattlesnake and McMahon. Starts from the beginning of Austin's first championship reign to the ""End of an ERA'First Blood Match with the Undertaker. Many funny excerpts include the infamous hospital attack, the concrete corvette, and many stunners!"
3,The Stone Cold-Vince McMahon Saga,"Nice DVD, but it could have been better with extras. Some of the matches that could have been shown include the following--April 13, 1998 (Dudle Love Returns)Unforgiven 1998King of the Ring 1998Austin-Kane June 29, 1998 (WWF Title)1999 Royal Rumble MatchGaunlet Match in TorontoFebruary 14, 1999 (Cage Match)WrestleMania XV Main Event (Rock-Austin)King of the Ring 1999Austin-Undertaker on RAW is WAR for WWF TitleAustin-Taker First Blood Match"
4,A great Disney animated VHS release... time for DVD!,"These Disney VHS cartoons were released in the 1980s, and I fondly remember renting the series many times from the local video shop. This particular tape is a collection of Walt Disney favorites (as in, favorites from the company, not the man himself). An excellent collection, which hopefully Disney will release on DVD along with others in the Cartoon Classics series. Until then, look for used VHS tapes in the Amazon Marketplace and auction sites."
4,listen up,"my belief is that the whole deal with this enduring design is the lack of a crossover network, which eliminates the blurring of sound which can occur in the most critical part of the audio spectrum, the midrange. its that simple. yes, the eq adds phase problems, but the lack of a crossover is a first order effect, relative to the more subtle effect of the skewed phase relationships caused by the equalization. there, i said it... i use and enjoy these speakers as my second system. the reference rig is magneplanar based, and i find much to love in both systems. remember the little klh fm radio? the henry kloss design? with a similar full range speaker? same deal. thanks!"
5,Listen,"I own two pairs of 901's series 6 currently and owned a third generation pair years ago. Best investment in sound possible.Simply put, if you don't like them you can sell them for what you paid easily just on their name alone.As for the sound, when placed properly, they will crank out base like no tomorrow. The mids are warm and the highs soft but clear.They are the most widely recognised speakers ever made and while they are controversial you will love them if you forget all you know about them when you listen carefully.In the end, if you want to spend more, a lot more, you can get better sounding speakers. But when you go to sell the more expensive speakers be prepared to give them away. Bose 901's will always fetch very near to what you paid.And you never need to worry about blowing them up by cranking them. I've only blown up 30% of the pairs I've owned and that took a staggering amount of power! :)"
5,"Don't mess with the rest, buy the best!","I have been the proud own of my 901's for 15 years and when I go out to do a comparison with what is presently being sold nothing else stands up to the 901's. These must be accompanied with only High output components and an array of accompanied Bose speakers such as center channel front and rear and subwoofer. A top of the line bose system should run you about $3,000.00 but worth every penny and they will last forever. Also, Bose has a program through the factory in which you can send your product to them and they will do a FREE diagnostics on them and if the proformance has sucomed to age or wear they will fix or replace anything for just the cost of shipping! If the speakers can not be fixed they will replace them for FREE! No other manufacturer stands behind their product like Bose. They also come with a 7 year warranty right out of the box. Simply worth every penny!"
4,"I Liked Them, But----","It's been 20+ years that I took home a pair of 901s on a week's approval. First let me state a few facts: I listen almost exclusively to classical music, had an inexpensive amp although I rarely listen to music louder than a moderate level (9 to 10 o'clock volume position) and they were in a small room (roughly 1300 cubic feet) with a very low ceiling. I tried my conventional speaker positioning, then another and another and another and couldn't find a position where they sounded ""right."" Finally I put them smack in the middle of the room with ""reasonable"" spacing and they sounded great - when I sat against the wall to listen! Very sadly I took them back."
5,Bose Speaker always GREAT,"Great speakers, must have room to properly locate them. Download the manual (.pdf) from the Bose home page and review requirement prior to purchasing. Follow the manufacturer's suggestions and Bose 901s rule!"
3,"Nice, but not perfect","I don't own these speakers as I found them unsatisfactory. The sound they produce is loud broad and very VERY warm. In fact if anyone is curious as to how a speaker can sound warm, these are the epitome. Having said that, the bass is strong but not distinct. It isn't tight, and offers very little punch. Also each speaker consists of 1 rear firing sub and a bundle of full range drivers. This produces accurate voice and instrument reproduction, but lacks the higher frequencies. By not including tweeters Bose has slapped every audiophile across the face. Add a dedicated subwoofer and some crystal clear tweeters and these speakers would blow most out of the water."

3,weres the beef,"this tea is not bad tasting in fact it has a very unique vegital earthey green taste in my opinion however no noticeable energy spike or any of the other described effects i steeped the tea for long periods in hopes of caffine substitute nothing,nothing,NOTHING!!!!!!"
1,Save Your Money,"I've bought coca tea from other websites that was of better quality for less money. Real coca tea leaves a slight numbing sensation in your mouth, There was no numbing sensation or any other effects from this tea. I brewed this tea with edible lime (the way it's supposed to be brewed) to enhance the tea. Still no effect. I just wasted 30 some dollars."
4,Windsor tea,Windsor is a popular tea made by a well known company it is tastey and satisfying. I liked it. It has a good shelf life.
3,Middle of the road,"Interesting book. I appreciated that the story moved quickly, but thought it was very cliche. The usual lack of female characters...(only one) and the usual hype about the fed agencies fighting each other every step of the way. The aspect of high finance was interest but again...it's been done.It was a nice beach day read, I'll give it that."
2,A good read for something to pass the time,"I found the characters Jason Lyman, Heidi and Sean to be interesting, though I thought Sean Gordon could have been more developed. The description of the finanical world is a bit out of date along with the politics but the story is a good one. I'm surprised this hasn't been made into a movie yet. It could easily be tweaked into one.PLOT SPOILER!I thought the lack of CIA involvement because Marcel being a double agent was brought out to late in the game. Sean Gordon could have been given more description about what he's doing and why he was following up on Heidi's tip from the mere fact that she asked him too. I also thought her character taking things into her own hands at the press conference was too much, along wiht parading out the mother. So it had a weak ending hence the 2 stars"
5,A gem of a CD,"It's quite funny in a way to admit this, but I bought this CD without listening to a single track. The CD was linked/associated (on Amazon) with another CD that I was buying at the time (2009). As it turned out, I like the CD so much! The shocker was seeing that the CD came out in 2003 as I assumed it must have come around the early 90s when music was!Judging by the ""fact"" that Javier didn't seem to have received a lot of airplay, I have to say he's music is way underrated. This an very great CD and way too refreshing considering the cool-aid of this age."
4,javier,"From all the reviews i read online, i thought i was going to grab the best album i have ever listened to. It wasn't the best however it came verry close to it. I have bee listening to the album for 3weeks straight & have even got a few workmates hooked on it. The songs all sound familiar but you cant pinpoint where u hav heard them before. He has a great mix of tracks, ranging from the jazzy influenced, to the folky, motown, hip hop...it's all here in one of the greatest albums released from an unknown."
3,joven pero experto,"muy buen album, buenas canciones a media marcha y los temas lentos son una pasada."
4,Constantly Playing it.........,"I heard ""Crazy"" sometime last summer. Wonderful! I was attending a conference in Nashville,Tn last week and ran into Javier b4 his concert that night! He was so nice and sweet. He let my friends and I take pictures with him even though he was in a hurry! The next day I went out and bought his Cd. It is in constant rotation in my cd player!"
3,Wow - great start for a new artist,"I anticipated buying this cd after seeing Javier's video ""Crazy"" all summer and was not disappointed. It is very refreshing to hear great MUSIC along with a great voice - the only reason I gave it 3 stars instead of 4 is because although Javier is a new artist, his voice sounds almost exactly like Eric Benet and I found myself comparing their voices as I listened but overall, this is a great addition to my collection.My favorite songs are: Crazy, Beautiful U R, Song For Your Tears, Biggest Mistake, If I Never Get To Heaven, She Spoke To Me, In Your Hands & October Sky."
2,Not Bad I'd say 2&Half,"I like His Guitar Playing&His Versatility.but the songs themselves are pretty much there&Vocally He reminds me of Brian Mcknight,Babyface,etc.. with the Acoustic Guitar.Been there down that&better in most instances.He is Talented but I don't hear a Knock out song as much as I Hear tight Music.when He gets Words&Music as One then He will escape being labeled in a box with others.He is a Talented Cat though&the Future Looks Promising but a Song like ""Crazy"" is cool for now but with Artistic Growth he pass that by Leaps&Bounds over time."
2,a little disappointing,I bought this CD after hearing Javier sing at a friend's wedding at which I thought he was amazing. I'm not sure if the CD was disappointing to me because I don't really care for the songs or maybe it was his charisma that truly impressed me at the wedding.
5,STRICTLY GROWN FOLKS MUSIC,"Amazing!! This one word describes this man's debut. I buy music all the time but this album is not only a blessing but a must for ANYONE who is tired of the current state of R&B music.Javier has captured something that not many have done so far...he has the soul of an old veteran but keeps it fresh as well.My favs.are tracks#1,2,4,6,and 14.To not have this in your collection would be a mistake. Hopefully his marketing team will do him just and promote this album right."
5,THIS IS A MUST,Look this is simply the best r'n'b album of the year. I havent been this excited about a new artist since Brian McKnight. Thank God there is finally a new artist out there who has actual vocal and writing talent. Mark my words Javier is the next big thing.
5,Amazed!!!,"I'm a very critical music fan. I've always been reluctant to buy albums by new artists, but the moment I heard ""Crazy"", I thought to myself, ""I my gosh!!! Who is that?!? When does his album come out?!?"". I immediately went out and bought this album without reading any reviews or hearing any clips from it.Let me just say this: ""WOW!"". It's so rare that I find a new artist whose entire album I can listen to, without skipping to the releases. Javier not only has an amazing voice but also writes great songs to compliment his voice. This album is definitely a must-have."
5,Javier-Great Debut,This cd is totally worth the buy. It has all the songs that would make you want to find someone just to sing them too. And plus he is a mad cutie.
4,A Cut Above The Rest!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Bubble gum music is for kids....i cant get wit' it!""The Biggest Mistake of my life"" is proof of a mature sound that comes from Mr. Javier. This cd was recommended by a friend to me .....NOW I AM RECOMMENDING IT TO U. BUY IT!!!!!!!!!!"
3,"good, but possibly confusing","While this book is very good in its discussion on sexuality, my one problem is that the pictures are quite artsy. This will be interesting for children, but there is the good possibility that they will be confused as to what the body parts actually look like. With supplemental pictures and and adult ready to answer questions, this is a good book to help teach children."
4,Great Basic Anatomy for Preschoolers,"There is only one page of this book I don't like which offers several ""alternative"" names for penises and vaginas/vulvas. Otherwise, the book is great. It explains male and female reproductive systems in an age appropriate way. The illustrations are cute and appropriate. And it briefly explains that these parts are private, which is also appropriate. I would suggest this to all families with preschoolers when they become interested in their bodies. Books always make explaining these basic things more fun!"
4,"liked it, but they only showed circumcised penises...","I was considering buying this for my 3.5 year old, but i was flipping through the pages, and only saw circumcised penises. I have an intact son, so i decided to not buy it."
2,Very confusing for parents and kids,"Despite all the positive reviews we were disappointed with this book. It gives quick definitions of the body parts and then immediately dives into the topic of getting familiar with your private parts in private. While parents might choose to skip that if it is not relevant to their kids, we found that we skip way too many areas and described things in different ways. The illustrations could be better too. One very significant topic that the book does not cover is the idea of sharing everything that might pertain to the private parts and other people - the child has to know that it is OK and be comfortable to share everything with parents."
1,Not for 4-8 year olds!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This book is illistrated very well, that's the problem, to well. I would be embarassed to give this book to a ten year old. The content and illistration is more geared toward 13 year olds. More like puterty. I know our kids are sexually active early, but a 4-8 year old does not need or want that much information. There is a full body illisration of a matured male. Not for 4-8 year olds!!!!!!"
4,Found a little help,"This was exactly what I needed to help me answer ALL the questions that my 6 yr old had about her/ girl's bodies without getting into the issues of intercourse.After a lot of research, I came across this option and i was not disappointed. I have already recommended this for this age group."
1,"Not appropriate for ""Pre-K -1st Grade","As my daughter started preschool I wanted to make sure that she understood some basics about what areas are private and what type of touching is inappropriate. Although this book covers these aspects, it goes into further detail covering conception and masturbation. This was a bit more than I was looking to share with a 3 year old."
4,Amazing You!: Getting Smart About Your Private Parts,I like the author's way of explaining the body parts for kids.This was recommended by a good friend who used it to explain to her kids.A great book to have for any parents pre-teen children.
2,One size does not fit all.,"I was trying to buy large tabi socks for myself. I have size 13 (US) feet. These socks do not fit me.Sincerely,Ira Carmel."
3,Look good and work but not durable,"They look and feel as they should but any slightly abrasive use can tear them, I'd say they would be fine for part of a costume but not for casual use around the house on a regular basis."
5,"A great pair of ""Ninja"" socks","I have a men shoe size of about 9-10 and these socks were a little tight around my feet at first; but after wearing them a few times they became comfortable. I would suggest wearing them with the stitching on the outside. Great product, cheap price"
3,Rips easily,"They rip very easily. Be careful when you have them on, and really be careful if your nails are sharp!"
2,Not durable,"Worn and washed one time, the elastic at the top of the socks separated. Don't expect durability in this product."
3,Meh.,They're pretty difficult to put on. If you're wearing them with Zori or Tabi Boots they're fine. Other than that just get some regular socks.
5,Keeps you on the edge of your seat.,"This book was on of the best books i've have ever read. I am 13 and i don't read that much, but when i started this book i just couldn't put it down. I usually don't read books of this type but my friend said I'd like it so i tried it and loved it. I recommended it to all my friends and almost all of them loved it. If you aren't into reading you will still love this book. At least pick it up and try it out. You should love it."
5,One of my Favorites don't miss it,The music is outstandingI have seen the movie at least 5 times and love listening to this soundtrack and singing as loud as I can.
3,Kinky Boots!!!,"So far, I only love ONE song on this particular album: Lyn Collins-Think (About It). This is obviously a compilation album; I don't know about any of the other songs. And I think this cover might be a tad bit raunchy for my taste. But all-in-all, IT'S OK!Thanx!"
1,give me my money back,"Actually I haven't received it, and I received a notification from amazon that I wouldn't be receiving it. I filed for a refund, but that didn't seem to work either. So I would be very grateful for help to get my money back."
2,Six dollars and thirty-tree cents...,"Is what EACH box of these costs if you buy them here. $6.33 I actually bought these and my son was out within a week. I was hoping for a bit more but the packs are tiny. There is nothing wrong with the quality and the flavor of the snacks but I am basically rating the price. This is the price you'd expect to pay if you got them at a vending machine at a hospital or some luxury trip where they are hard to find. If you can make it to the supermarket however, get them there; this is not worth it!"
1,Yuk!,"Not only is the taste artificial, but my toddler doesnt love these, Theyre sweet and really soft which is not bad for toddlers, but the taste is not to be sacrificed!"
5,Excellent!,"This is great country music; every song is very good. Especially good is ""I've Still Got Some Hurting...""--wow! Along with I LIVED TO TELL IT ALL, this is George Jones' best work of the 80s and 90s."
1,Very little mesquite,I find this to have very little actual mesquite in the wood chips. Lacks the normal mesquite smell and flavoring.
5,A short but encouraging invitation to wholeness,"Johnson provides many engaging illustrations of the shadow aspect of personality from myth, culture, history and religion. The ""golden"" shadow is also mentioned, that brightest and most noble aspect of ourselves often projected before it is integrated.Johnson captures the relevance of shadow work for this time in a line on page 27: ""Any repair of our fractured world must start with individuals who have the insight and courage to own their own shadow.""A must for those of us headed into an ""ownership"" society!"
4,Opens Slow but Closes Strong,"At the opening of the book I found myself somewhat at odds with the author's presentation. I just chaff when I see the words always and never used in examples about people/life. At about page 50 the groundwork has been laid and the strongest arguments come out. The second half of the work examines some very interesting ideas and makes the whole a worthwhile, and fairly quick read."
1,Disappointing,"Despite encouraging reviews and an enticing title, ""Owning your own shadow"" is little more than an essay, albeit an intreging one. I was impressed with Johnson's ideas about the relationship between religion and shadow, but disappointed by the length of the book which kept me occupied for little more than a couple of hours (after waiting weeks for it to arrive from Amazon). I was further frustrated by the book's inability to provide any practical exercises, and particularly by Johnson's breaking off before even working through an example he presents, claiming that ""every such solution has to grow from the unique situation that one faces"" (p. 87). In that case, why write a book, Robert?"
3,Owning Your Own Shadows,"I read this book after a suggeston from a friend and was a little disappointed. It was nice in that it was easy to read, but it did not seem to do very much more than skim over the basics. It would seem that an author would offer more in the way of practical information in a book of this type. I guess that I would be compelled to call this a beginner's book on the subject. It is the first that I have read on the subject, but hopefully there are more detailed ones out there."
2,A lot of padding,"I found this book over simplistic. I don't know who Robert Johnson is writing for but from this book I would guess it was for those with learning difficulties. He repeats his points over and over again, basically I think the actual content of this book could be covered in a 5 pages rather than 118. I guess he does have to spread out the plugs he gives for his other books."
3,As If This Book Needed Another Review . . .,"I, too, picked this book largely because it had been recommended by Tori Amos. I didn't happen to care for the Christian slant but was able to ignore it for ""the sake of finding the rest of the value of the book."" I didn't agree with Johnson's thoughts on Nietzche --he is way off base with that one! It is a good introductory book, if you're looking for some (light) Jungian theory."
3,Disappointing,"Perhaps reading the source for these concepts would be better. Johnson injects too much religious over-lay into his writing. It's embarrassing to see this kind of cultural bias on a neutral subject.Also, this book, printed by HarperOne, is very cheap pulp paper. Even at c. $10, Amazon price, it is over priced. I will have to remember to stay away from HarperOne printings."
2,I couldn't quite understand this book,I couldn't quite understand this book maybe because it was too dark. Maybe someday down the road I will re-read this book again and get some understanding out of it but as for today I cannot make heads or tails of it.
3,Introduction to the shadow,"I thought this book was a good introduction to ""the shadow"", but it was not comprehensive in terms of how to tease the shadow out or how to integrate it into your life. I thought it was going to be more self-helpful (without being cheezy), but left me wanting more. Like, ""ok, here's the issue. how do we deal with it?"" But it really just introduces the issue without giving a set way to handle it. This is good if you are committed to seeking out the answer, but I was left with more questions than anything else. Further reading required."
3,Kind of eh.,"A very slim book, this does not go into any depth about owning the shadow, nor does it discuss methods for getting in touch with those parts of oneself. It reads like a dashed-off summary of the author's thinking and is in fact filled with references to his other work. There are a few anecdotes but nothing earth-shattering. For beginners only, not for anyone looking for in-depth treatment of this subject."
4,Confronting the shadow,"Owning your own shadow is a profound yet simple explanation of Dr. Jung's theory. Acknowldging and confronting the shadow of self, and how it manifest in our daily lives is brought to life in such a subtle way within this book. I recomend it to all willing to look at a deeper meaning and growth to self."
4,Simple and Petite,"Robert A. Johnson, a Jungian analyst wrote a self-help book (I would hesitate to call it psychology) on discovering your shadowside, or the being not in your everyday awareness. Some call this demons, others reflections or perhaps repressed emotions or ""drives."" Whatever the case may be the book is a good introduction to Carl G. Jung himself on the subject of shadows, as well as helping oneself understanding and becoming aware of their own shadows that they may have repressed some time ago. Overall a short and sweet book."
5,Masochism revealed,An insightful look at a Jungian perspective of masochism. Cowan makes some excellent points about ego and psyche and the need to face one's shadow. I found the book very enlightening.
5,Great product and great company,How often do you buy something this inexpensive that you can later get a replacement part for? Many manufacturers don't sell replacement parts. But Intex does. I lost the hose for my pump and was able to order a new one for $4.21 on the Intex web site. Sweet!The pump works great for blowing up our air bed and kids inflatable toys. We've had several of these things over the years and this is the best one we've had.
2,"Indoor use only, not for outside use","I had to buy another one from Walmart. This item is only for indoor use only. I tried to use it using my Car's cigarette lighter and it wouldn't work. It's now useless to me, as I can't use it outside. They should mention this before buyer can decide. I could have use that info and not buy this in the first place."
3,Decent Remote for the Money,"Overall I think that the concept of this device is outstanding. Having the ability to combine functions like Volume onto your DVD settings allows you to use only one remote instead of two. Also, the price makes this an excellent value for someone who has a few remotes, but not overloaded.My only two complaints are that the touchpad is a little hard to use. Sometimes your thumb will hit a couple of numbers and unlike remotes, you do need to look at the remote while pressing the buttons. However, I was able to remedy that porblem by velcro-ing a PDA pen (like a stylus) onto the side of the device.The second complaint is that the software they send you is not that easy to use. It seems like once you make updates to an additional screen, you need to re-program all of the ""learned"" functions.Overall it still solves alot of headaches at a great price."
1,Piece of Junk,"Despite some of the cautionary reviews from other purchasers, I decided to take a risk on this product. Don't do it. Among other things, it claims to have successfully ""learned"" a remote code, but then doesn't actually transmit the code. Tried 15 times to teach it the same set of codes, and it never worked. When I tried to teach it how to operate my digital cable box, I found that it couldn't transmit a sequence of numbers (""1-8-0"" for channel 180, for example). This prompted a call to tech support, which informed me that the product cannot, in fact, transmit more than two codes in sequence -- which means, for all practical purposes, that it can't control most cable boxes. What is the point of a ""universal"" A/V remote that can't control a cable box?I actually liked the interface and the NeoEdit software -- the concept here is good. The basic problem with this product is that it doesn't do what it is supposed to do. Back to the drawing board."
1,Caged Heat-Mediocre is not the word for this Garbage.,"I guess they were going for ""Realism"" because the Women are hideously ugly,the scenes boring and the action nothing major,Probably the Worst Women in prison film I have had the misfortune of seeing as of yet.Stick To seeing Pam Grier,It's a goodthing I saw on Netflix instantly and Did not have to waste money buying this garbage."
2,Caged Heat is Dead Beat,"This movie was a big dissapointment. Lame acting, lame script and 70's chicks with bad acting skills. Not a very good ""Women In Prison"" film....there are better one like ""Reform School Girls""....the band Caged Heat is way better than the movie...pass it up and get a life!"
1,Worst movie ever seen...,"I bought this movie because some of the reviews were giving it some credit; I enjoyed classics like Red Heat and Chained Heat with Linda Blair and thought this might be similar. Its not. Its one of the worst movies I have ever seen. There is no story line, the editing sucks, the acting sucks... I don't know what pills other were on giving it 4 stars or better, but I thought it was a waste of money..."
2,Mediocre 70s women-in-prison film.,"Caged Heat has all the typical elements of a 70s women-in-prison film; a cruelly sadistic warden and prison guards, wrongfully imprisoned inmates, lust-crazed, predatory lesbians, inmate rivalries, etc. This particular film genre, was as ubiquitous during the 70s, as the Afro hairdo.It's a Roger Corman pic, starring Roberta Collins, and a few other actors who appeared in many of his other AIP films. It has the low-budget veneer of Corman's other films, along with the nudity, gratuitous sex, over-the-top violence, and subversive story-lines that are Corman's signature as a producer.This movie isn't the worst of the low-budget women-in-prison films, but I've seen better. For those that like this movie genre, Caged Heat offers adequate, if mediocre entertainment."
2,Corman hit a new low with this one...,"First off, I LOVE a good WIP flick, this just happens NOT to be one of them. The other reviewers are demented in their attempts to add meaning to this worthless celluloid waste of time. It`s the same old plot Corman used in at least 2 or 3 of his other WIP flix, the women are ugly, the dialogue unbearable, the acting third rate, and it`s a vivid portrayal of everything that went wrong in 70`s cinema. This is grindhouse at its worst - grab yourself a Jess Franco flick instead, there`s a much better chance you won`t want to trade your eyes for a pair of running shoes when the women get undressed."
5,Great small saw,"I love my 141. It's a great little saw. I used it to clear 1/2 acre of trees, up to 60' white pine and douglas firs. It handled them without complaint. It's best strength is it's light weight. It's perfect for trimming branches and felling smaller trees. If I were going to do more heavy work with it, I would trade up, but I think she'll last me quite some time."
1,Fix or repair daily,"I bought the husqvarna 141 6 years ago. It worked alright the first year, used only for light homeowner duty -- cutting firewood, and removing some 8-inch diameter trees. The saw was stored with fuel stabilizer in the carburetor every winter. The past years were filled with reliability issues. On every project, I had to fix something different. The safety clutch cover had to be replaced because the little aluminum chain safety guard wore out repeatedly. The fuel line got brittle and broke, requiring a hunt for that tiny fuel hose, and a tricky reinstallation. Starting the saw, even after carburetor cleaning and a new spark plug, was always a chore. Lately it quit every few seconds, with a full fuel tank. I am experienced in maintenance and operation of small engines and don't think the unit should require so much repair and maintenance. Replaced it with a STIHL yesterday."
4,Has held up with lots of abuse,"I have had my Husqvarna 141 for a few years now and have cut hundreds of trees down from a few inches to over a couple of feet in diameter. Sure the saw works hard when cutting thru a 2 foot trunk but it did the job. The only trouble I have had with it was when the spark plug went bad, besides that it has started relatively easy everytime. The lightweight makes it manageable when climbing to take a tree down when it simply cannot be dropped due to obstacles. I have even used used it to cut railroad ties, however the chains burn up pretty quick. All in all it has held up pretty well given the abuse I put it thru. Time to go off and thin out a few more trees."
4,"Famous Faces of the Thirties Are a Fussin' and a Feudin""","""To The Last Man"",starring Randolph Scott, from 1933 based on a Zane Grey story, is truly the story of who will be the last man standing, as two families' fussin' and feudin' takes it's toll on all over the years.And to boot, the Romeo and Juliette theme takes over as our guy Randy falls for the wrong woman! It's directed by Henry Hathaway, and what a cast...Esther Ralston, Jack La Rue, Buster Crabbe, Noah Berry, Gail Patrick and Fuzzy Knight. Also look for John Carradine and a little tiny Shirley Temple.These names and faces alone make it worth the view!Enjoyable fare for the oater lover...happy trails...Laurie"
2,Obviously Written by Intellectuals for Intellectuals,"I love the book Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance. It was one of those books that I tried to read years ago but was simply not ready for it. After a recent conversation with a friend that mentioned the book, I decided to pick up a copy and read it. This time I was ready.After my second reading Of ZMM, I decided to purchase Guidebook to Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance. My hope was to deepen my understanding.I gave up on reading Guidebook to Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance about half way through Section 8 (Critical Reviews). This book seems obviously written by intellectuals for intellectuals. Maybe it will be one of those books I will pick up again when I'm ready. For now, I'm not ready."
5,Phenominally demonstrative of both the instrument and the organist,"This and other a-s organ recordings are very precious to me. With St. John the Divine's organ now silent, being repaired after the 2001 fire, it is truly wonderful to have the sound captured. It's Ms. Papdakos willingness and courage to experiment that is so impressive. It was no surprise to hear that Gerre Hancock was influential in her becoming such a phenominal improvisationalist. Thank you for sharing your talent Dorothy, on this CD and the others you created as well!"
5,Great nail files,A friend of mine had this kind of nail file and told me she had had them for almost 10 years. She said she has never replaced it and they still file like they were brand new. I found this one and I have had it for a couple months. I love it. I love the sturdiness of the file and the fact that they will never dull.
1,An all-around cheap looking production of an earth-shattering event!,"One would think that ""the shot heard 'round the world"", the killing of Arch-Duke Ferdinand and his wife Sophie on July 28, 1914 sparking WW1 would have somewhat a better treatment than this terribly cheap, voice-dubbed, badly acted, stupidly scripted.....ugh! How in the world did Christopher Plummer and Maximilian Schell ever end up in this 111 minute mess? Apart from the information that one gains in regards to the Bosnian struggle for freedom and the Austro-Hungarian Empire, this film is so incredibly bad in it's look, it's print, it's editing that one painful viewing is all that is required."
3,Proficient Motorcycling,"The book's nicely written. Very easy to follow. It's a great read for all riders with all levels of riding experience from newbies to vets. I've ridden for over 100,000 miles and have completed the MSF Experienced Rider Course and the book reconfirmed most of everything I've come across over the years and managed to learn a few new things also.The only negative comment I have is that the binder is already falling apart. Not too impressive for a brand new book."
3,Pretty Good,"I ordered this book and Motorcycling Excellence, and i prefer the latter. For a beginner, Motorcycling Excellence is a much more thorough, current, and easily readable book.With that said, Proficient Motorcycling is not a bad book either. David Hough is an expert rider with decades of experience under his belt.3 out 5 stars from me."
3,Good Read,I am a beginner and this book was very helpful. Stressed the coutner steering method quite a bit much but over all this was a great read.
4,Well worth reading,Good informative book. Definately worth reading. It will make you think twice about doing some of the things you might have done on your motorcycle before reading this book.
3,Proficient Motorcycling book review,This is an ok book. It follows and reiterates the information of the previous book by this author. Use as a refresher.
5,Proficient Motorcycling: The Ultimate Guide to Riding Well,"I read this book before taking a motorcycle safely course. It allowed me the benefit of understanding an otherwise poor oral presentation given by the instructor. I put to use the information I had read during the riding portion of the safety course.Mr.Hough did a great job of keeping me interested when what I really wanted to do is ride like the wind. I could not imagine riding without first reading his book, cover to cover. I have also gone back on more than one occasion to better understand things like the contact patch.Read this book and stay safe."
3,Proficient Motorcycling,"I agree with what is written about the excellent material in the book however, the binding is not what one would expect in a book that could become a lifelong reference volume. After one easy look through, the pages started coming away from the binding. In a book that may be one of the best written on how to remain safe on a motorcyle, one would expect a binding that would get through at least one reading. I am wondering if Mr. Hough knows what type of material the publisher is using. I would gladly pay more for a binding that would last through at least several readings. I love the book's content and David Hough has given so much to the motorcycle community but I am really disappointed in the quality of the binding and would caution anyone buying this book to consider this point."
4,Great Motorcycle Resource,"This is a great book, filled with lots of details about the science of motorcycles, techniques of riding, and explains the ""whys"" of the skills which are taught in the MSF class. There is a vast amount of info to digest for the novice rider as well as ""homework assignments"" intended to increase your skill level. The heavy quality of the paper is great, but the binding job is horrible ... one flip of a page and it falls out of the book. The book should really be spiral bound, and my solution was to 3-hole punch the pages and put them into a notebook. Bottom line, take your time absorbing the materials, practice the techniques, and increase your confidence and enjoyment levels. It's a great book."
4,All pages falling off,"The book is very good for beginners, although it can be very repetitive. The bad thing about this book, I began reading it and the pages began to fall off, I now have half of the book as loose pages."
3,Proficient Motorcycling: The Ultimate Guide to Riding Well,"The material in the book is very good. I think there are some very good tips, especially for beginners such as myself. The big complaint I have is the binding of the book. The book is very poorly put together, and all my pages have fallen out. I had to get a three ring binder and punch holes in all my pages and just throw them in that. The pages started falling just 50 pages into the book...and I bought the book brand new and only had it for 2 days."
3,Great information for all riders,"This book has lots of information on riding techniques, bike physics and avoiding trouble. Being an informed rider increases the odds of being a healthy rider at the end of the day.My brother had a motorcycle accident that may of been avoidable. When he went to the doctor, amoung other things, the doctor took out his RX pad and wrote the name of this book on it and said read it.I have now given a copy of this book to three of my riding freinds. Each has read all or parts of it and have said thanks."
1,Binding,"Nice book but possibly the worst binding job I have ever seen, pages liberated themselves from the binding with every turn. I returned for a refund."
1,Great Book-Fell Apart within 20 minutes,Loved this book but the pages started falling out within 20 minutes of reading. Very dissapointed.
5,Proficient Motorcycling,"At last! A book that talks about the things a lot of people learn by trial and error. Unfortunately, an ""error"" in motorcycle riding can be both costly and very painful. This book talks about the things you would WANT to learn from an experienced coach. It6 is worth the dollars times 10."
4,Absolutely required reading,"Needs to be on your list, whether you're a beginning rider, or someone who's been on two wheels for years."
5,Must Read For The Mature Rider,"As a 45 year old just starting to ride, this book was perfect. Despite the warnings from others, I discovered in this book that motorcycle riding can be safe and enjoyable. The strategies presented are sound and easy to understand. The diagrams are great and the read is simple.Read this book and stay alive!"
3,Book falls apart,"The content of this book is absolutely excellent. The binding is absolutely the most atrocious I've experienced. I have a stack of detached pages after one reading of the book. If anyone (publisher, amazon) takes these reviews to heart...DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT!!!"
3,"Good content, incredibly poor binding","This book contains a large amount of practical, useful and comprehensible information that should be valuable to any motorcycle operator who wants to ride safely. It covers areas from accident statistics, driving and operating tips, to strategy.However, as other reviewers have commented, the binding is very poor quality. I was barely 20 pages into the book before pages began to fall away from the spine. My copy is now held together by rubber-bands and glue. I am surprised that a publisher would continue to charge so much money for a book without correcting this problem...I would have given the book 5 stars based on content, but only gave it 3 in response to the poor quality of the binding."
5,soon-to-be proficient motorcyclist,"Being a beginning motorcyclist, I wanted some sage advice on what to look out for from someone who knew. That's exactly what you get from David Hough in ""Proficient Motorcycling"". This is a great addition (but not substitution) for the MSF Safety Course. The book is plain English and easily read. Great book for either new people to motorcycling or even those with a little experience who want to learn more about how and why a motorcycle does what it does."
5,Very easy to read and very informative.,"Very easy to read and very informative. Each of the chapters can be read on their own but you may want to read the first chapter on the first reading. I recommend this book with out hesitation for all riders but especially for beginning riders. The chapter on low speed maneuvers will on it's own be worthwhile to beginners. Of course, the best way to continuously learn new riding techniques is to continuously consider yourself a beginner (in the mind of a beginner their are many possibilities, in the mind of an expert, few)."
5,Riding better already,"I bought this book based on some feedback on a motorcycle riding forum that I belong to. I have not taken my MSF yet, but reading the book I am already learning tips and tricks that have helped me ride better and safer."
3,Ya know riding is dangerous. Geee really?? Thank you Dave,"I enjoy everything motorcycles from the bikes to techniques that make me a better and safer rider. Mr.Hough is seemingly unaware that many riders realize that riding has its risks (we're all not that stupid, Dave). I don't need stories of Biker Bob picking up his right foot after he high sides his bike on a bananna peel . Other than Uncle Dave trying to ""scare you straight"" its good stuff."
1,Great Book - Poor Binding quality,The major problem I have with this book is that the pages separate and fall out. very poor binding quality.
3,"Good, but repetitive","Highly recommended for those fairly new to motorcycling. Written in an easy to read and entertaining style, like a collection of magazine articles. It's not very technical. A few points are covered again and again, namely countersteering and delayed apex turns. If you're an experienced biker and you've taken the advanced MSF course, there's probably not too much new information for you here. But if you want a good explanation on why bikes need to steer to the right to begin a turn to the left, this book has it."
5,Excellent,"I had borrowed a neighbors, whom purchased it to actually share with his wife for preparation in commuting by bicycle to work. I ordered this for my brother, whom recently purchased his first Harley. He was greatly impressed and appreciative."
1,OH MY GOD!!!! IT'S SO BAD,"I purchased this CD because it was so cheap and I'm a HUGE fan of The Phantom of the Opera, not just the Lloyd Webber version. There is a reason this is so cheap, it SUCKS! The cast jumps around: the Phantom is sung by THREE different people throughout the CD and none of them can hold the notes the part requires. Angel of Music is repeated one right after the other for some reason and is then followed by The Mirror piece. Possibly the worst track on the CD is The Point of No Return, which is my favorite song from this musical. The Phantom's part is sung completely off key. Doesn't even deserve the 1 star I gave it. DO NOT waste your money, not even for die hard fans!"
1,It's OK.,"I just purchased this cd today at Kmart. As a diehard Phantom Phan, I love everything that has to do with it. This cd contains ten highlights from the show. Although the people singing don't have amazing vocal ranges, they're still able to sing the songs.Some of the songs ie: Think of Me and Angel of Music have different lyrics, which surprised me. I have never heard them before, so it was strange.I spent five dollars on this. Even though it isn't amazing, it's still Phantom. I give it one star."
3,Broadway POTO,"A pleasant array of broadway's vocalists singing songs from the musical production ""Phantom of the Opera."""
1,Saturday's Warrior,"Bought DVD to show to youth group, DVD doesn't have the whole play. Missing the last 6 or so chapters."
1,"Do You Like 80s Music, Stripped of Creativity? If So, Buy This Album!","This is the worst farking shiat that I have ever heard in my life. My company was sent this CD to promote via in-store play at a number of our locations and I have not heard anything close to this terrible in the last three years of promotion. To me this CD is what would happen if you took every bad song from the 80s, stuck it in a blender, added 3 cups of reverb, and let it purée. This might make a good gift to a friend who still sports a mullet or any type of ""big hair."" I hope God has mercy on the souls of everyone involved in this release."
4,"Fancy Footwork, indeed.","This album is a delightful blend of modern lyrics and a retro 80's dance groove that blesses your ears for perhaps a bit too short.The track that brought this album to my attention was Fancy Footwork. I would enjoy this track alone with no lyrics, as an extended play version, but though this track tends to carry the album, the rest of the tracks are strong enough to not seem like they're just slapped in as filler."
4,Great Encyclopedia of Polish Tradition and Customs,"According to my knowledge this is the most comprehensive book devoted to Polish customs available for English speaking readers. I recommend it especially for people with Polish ancestors or these who are interested in Polish traditions or anthropology. It may be also used as a reference book or the encyclopedia. But, the book is very interesting to read from cover to cover also. It contains an index and some pictures - I wish it had more!Overall, Sophie Hodorowicz did a wonderful job - she arranged the majority of customs according to calendar - entangling the customs with the seasons of the year and the Christian feasts traditions."
1,Loved it until I couldn't get a replacement bulb,"Thank for all for ending my search for a replacement bulb. I am absolutely appalled to read that I have to throw the lantern away - that goes against everything I stand for!!! It's enough to make me avoid GE products in the future, if that is their attitude."
1,Dumpster chow,"bulb died during the 2nd power outage it was used in. Bulb does come out, but like everyone here who has had one fail, too bad. Amazon, you should pull this ad off, this is just bad customer service at it most wasteful and annoying. Funny, I tried to rate i no stars but it would not take it."
1,"Great lamp, but you can't replace the bulb","I really did like this lamp while it lasted: bright, efficient, well made (except for battery cover). After three sets of batteries, the lamp died. Sadly, you can't replace the lamp if you tried: it's hardwired and would require soldering even if you could find the replacement part. Since the lamp is the most likely part to fail, it won't be long until many of these end up in the landfill. The good news is that I now have 90% of a pretty decent lamp, so off to the project bench to retrofit it with LEDs.By the way, that lamp contains mercury and should go along with other CFLs through a household universal waste service. Hardwiring it into the lamp makes it even harder to do the right thing, but four screws and a few snips of thin wire does the trick."
4,Lamp does the Job,It lives up to expectations.Better than most others in the amount of light it gives off.
5,Great!!,This album is a great insperation to many and I know that it is to me. The song You Lie is a great one to relate to and also the Greatest Man I Never Knew. They have touched me and I know they will you too.
4,Good greatest hits package,"This is some of Reba's best material, and there isn't a bad song on this CD. Some of the best songs on here are, ""You Lie"", Rumor Has It"", ""Is There Life Out There"", ""Fancy"", ""Does He Love You"", and ""Walk On"". All of these songs except for ""Fancy"" were #1 hits. The only downside to this album is that it is missing LOTS of songs that were either No. 1s or top tens.All in all this is a good album and I would recommend it to Reba fans."
5,FANCY,GREAT SONGS ON THIS CD IT DOSEN'T GET ANY BETTER THAN REBA. SHE SINGS FROM THE HEART. I LOVE THAT ABOUT HER SONGS.
3,"Solid, But I wouldn't Have included ""Fancy"" in This","Except for ""Fancy"" this is a great Reba hits compedium. I especially like ""They Asked about You"" which is traditional Reba with an incredible range. ""Walk On"" is probably her finest uptempo tune. As I said, ""Fancy"" (which peaked only at #8 at a time when most of her singles would hit #1 or at least top 5) should show that this song......a really ""ugly"" song should not have been included in this. Otherwise I would give this CD 5 stars."
1,F U R M,"After seeing Reba rip the Dixie Chicks on the awards show tonight, F U R M is all that needs to be said. She's a no-talent, fugly, brain-dead hillbilly who should be working in a convenience store somewhere instead of being given a platform to take shots at real musicians who aren't even in the room. Go back to the Ozarks RM. We won't miss you at all."
2,Product seller book,"On the back of the book it refers to the author practicing ancient traditions of tanning and hiding. This is what interested me into buying the book. After getting it in the mail today I read through it and concluded that I wasted my money on the product. I have found more information googling with ""how to"" articles then reading this book, especially concerning the traditional methods that have been used for years before all these solutions and such have came out.My advice, google what your looking for. This book mostly refers you to other products, like the bait on the fishing hook."
5,Excellent works,Very comprehensive. Written in easy to understand language. Good illustrations. Highly recommend this book to anyone interested in the art.
4,fur prepping,This is a good book showing how to make the most of your catch.It gives all the details to properly handle your furs
5,Perfect starter tripod,"As a beginning photographer I wanted a smallish, lightweight tripod to use with my Nikon D80. Since this is merely a hobby and good, lightweight tripods are very expensive I was torn what to do (the camera and a really good lens were already pretty expensive). Fortunately I happened across this tripod and decided I would spend a little more (ok, twice as much) than I had intended. Frankly it was well worth it. The construction is very solid, the entire setup is lightweight and stability is great. I've been very pleased with my purchase, from capturing excellent photos of July 4th fireworks to stop action photos of waterfalls where a tripod is essential, and the relative lightweight of the Velbon made hiking 3 miles uphill with it even feasible. I don't have a lot of experience in photography yet, but I'm a fan of Velbon already."
4,A Great Starter for the Next Level,"Overall: A great bargain for an intermediate photographer seeking a light, versatile, travel tripod of carbon fiber material without spending over $1000. I put this on a wish list and received as a gift after searching dozens of options by Manfrotto, Bogen, and the like. Essentially, I found that you would need to pay at least twice the price to get a kit (including adjustable head) for similar quality.Typical Usage: Long exposure and stability shots for a heavy Canon 1Ds with an L-series 70-200mm lens (at least 8 lbs.)Pros: Price, portability, construction, solidity, strength/weight ratio, resistance to slipping exceptionalCons: Doesn't allow for upgrading with professional attachments (e.g. ballhead) from other providers; vinyl travel bag a bit cheap; somewhat of a hassle to ""fold away"" the head within the case; having to adjust two knobs rather than a single trigger ballhead a bit time consuming"
4,curly pet sheet mini,"The toy is adorable, made well, and loved by our small dog. The problem comes with the charge for shipping. That is the only thing preventing me from getting more."
4,More readable than Trauma by Mattox,"This book by an acknowledged trauma guru, contains similar information to that which is found in the trauma ""bible"" by Mattox. However its more concise style means that it is far easier to read. Ideally you would have both titles on your bookshelf, ""Current Therapy of Trauma"" to read cover to cover, and ""Trauma"" to have as a reference for more in-depth study. These two books are the ones to have!"
3,Just not what I expected.,The martingale feature just doesn't work as well as a chain martingale collar. It look goods but just isn't as functional as I thought of it.
1,Fades quickly to a pale dingy green,"This collar was very striking when we first put it on or dark gray dog. Great size/structure for any mastiff breeds. I was very disapointed when the green faded to an icky dingy pale color though. Also have this collar in purple and pink, which held fast to their color."
2,"My fault, should have bought with a clip","This item is not practical for me because you have to put it over your dog's head every time it goes on, or off. A clip on collar closure would be better. I can't have it so loose because I don't want it to fall off and that means it is hard to get off or I have to adjust it every time. This is a regret, I wasted my money buy."
3,A Meanderingly Cute Creep fest,"I am not against creepy literature for children. But I think if a book's creepy it almost has to be better written than regular children's literature. At a hundred and eleven pages, this is not a book I'd like to sit down and try to read to my neice or nephew over and over again. I could see it making an excellent episode on the sci fi channel, but it doesn't entirely work as a children's book. All of the characters (especially the wonderful animals) are detailed enough. The soap lady though, looks like a cross between a rough sketch of a classic alien from Area 51 and a skeleton. She does endearing things, but is still way too creepy. Part of it is that she has no mouth or eyes. The word choices in this book are complex at times, then switch back to being overly simple. The book feels like it can't decide whether it's a graphic novel or a children's book. Whether it's for adults or kids. So it falls somewhere in between and doesn't seem to work for either."
3,Beautiful but eh,"I call this ""The German Porn Star Deck"". It's very modern, unfussy and some of the images are strikingly gorgeous. HOWEVER, I cannot help but imagine an eighties era photo shoot with a photographer cueing the wind machine & coaxing the models to 'make loooooove to the camera!'. It's distracting. I have a tough time reading with this deck but when I'm doing a party, I make it part of my Tarot Petting Zoo because someone always falls in love with it.All that said, the cards are an unusual but perfect size, thin but good-feeling stock. if you can get past the looks on the faces, it's a good deck."
1,"Not Large as marked, but small, 1/4""-3/8"" size. RIPE OFF!","I have purchase jumbo and large size cotton balls before, (they have many uses), so when I saw these marked as ""LARGE"", it seemd a great deal. These are not Large, they are not even medium, they are so small, it is a joke. Major Ripe Off! No larger than 3/8"" diameter."
5,Compression socks for men,"I have been using compression stockings, knee high, low compression, for years because I stand on my feet a lot. I first noticed how effective they were when I followed the lead of a surgery resident and tried some hospital grade stockings. Have worn them ever since. Jobst is a major player in the business and my first set of stockings purchased from them has lasted 10 years. Highly recommended."
3,Check with Doctor First,"I ordered a compression grade that was much less firm than I needed for my condition. Before purchasing, be sure you talk to your doctor to not only get fitted for the right size (s,m,l,xl), but also the right style (knee high vs. thigh high) and the proper compression."
4,"Great quality, but some creep","The quality and fit is great, however, all three pair I have tend to tighten in the foot area after wearing them a little while. Even if I pull the toe section back out to create extra room for my toes, they soon creep back to where my toes are being pulled back against my foot. I even bought a larger-than-needed size and it still happens. Otherwise, a great product."
5,worthy addition,"The reviewer who found the book ""not rigorous"" is correct in the sense that Zee's emphasis is not on long technical proofs, but rather on clarity, brevity and physical insight.There are many texts on quantum field theory (such as the classic, Itzykson and Zuber, or the more recent volumes by Weinberg or Peskin) that are more technical - just as there are books that cover the material in the Feynman lectures from a more mathematical perspective.However, I find when teaching quantum field theory that most students have trouble developing an intuitive or physical grasp of the subject. That is what this book (uniquely) addresses. It is full of small gems of pedagogy and insight.It is unrealistic to think that a serious student would only own a single text on quantum field theory. The cost of a book is negligible relative to the hours (years?) of effort necessary to master the subject! In my opinion Zee's book deserves its place among the classics."
4,Good,good quality ... only a little scratch on the right-top ...maybe some problems in the tripgood quality ... only a little scratch on the right-top ...maybe some problems in the trip
1,Not For Beginers,"This Book is not that easy as most reviewers say ,any one wishesto buy this book must be ready for the high Math. in this book,for me i cann't give any stars(sorry one star by force from amazon) for this book since i am not in a position to do so ,i have returned the book back to amazon and still looking for more elementary book ,This Book is for people holding degrees Higher than Phd. in math."
5,The MVP of QFT Books,"I have the impression that few people in the world understand QFT but still much fewer people understand it in an extremely deep way. I also feel as though you can judge a lecturer's depth of knowledge by the existence of ""gems of insight"" and idiosyncratic ""pearls of wisdom"", which can cause you to look differently at a subject that you thought you knew well. After having attended a very large number of lectures on QFT, Quantum Field Theory in a Nutshell appears to be nothing more than a large and dense collection of these gems and pearls. It's absolutely fantastic."
5,QFT for the 21st century,"Zee's book is a gem. It reveals the beauty and usefulness of quantum field theory (QFT) in a pedagogically clear and interesting fashion. It is not stuck to the traditional particle physics view with its emphasis on scattering cross sections, etc. It includes gravitation right from the start and the first chapter has an exercise on the propagator for a massive field in curved spacetime. How refreshing! Besides gravitation, one finds nice applications of QFT to collective phenomena. One of the unique features of the book is that it bridges many modern topics together including abelian and non-abelian gauge theory, gravitation, condensed matter physics and topological field theory. Surface growth is also discussed, a topic of current interest in non-equilibrium statistical mechanics. In short, Zee's book is QFT as viewed in the 21st century: a broad subject applicable to many fields."
4,No ordinary months-of-the-year book,"Charming two-dimensional pastel art and brief, alliterative text depict children at play doing different activities, one for every month of the year."
4,Martial Arts Nostalgia II,"This was the third book in the series written by Marc Olden about an adventurer known to friend and foe alike as the Black Samurai.In this one martial arts expert Robert Sand saves Manhattan from atomic destruction.Along the way he does battle with,among others,a giant axe-weilding Apache warrior.Like the other books in this series this was published in the early 70s during the twin eras of blaxploitation and kung fu-mania.However this is not some cheap, exploitive potboiler.It's a good book.And I recommend it to both martial arts and adventure fans.Good pulp fiction."
3,ISI 2416 profi whip,"I received mine in a box that had been unsealed which was my first disappointment. Second, I expected that the ISI (Austria) products were made in europe but this was made in China, seriously, you can't make enough money on a $[...] creamer if you made it in europe?. Third, I paid the extra bucks for a stainless unit and then it states on the box that the head is aluminum, only the bottle is stainless. I realize that the description is lacking on the net but this is boarderline fraud."
5,AWESOME,If you can afford this one it's worth it's weight in gold. We couldn't live without an ISI Whipper. We own 2. One for our home and this one for our lake house.
4,Great product and I use it for quick vodka infusions,"I've had this product for several years now. It was actually at the bottom of the kitchen drawer unused for a very long time. Cutting down on fat and all that. Just recently it got re-purposed for making quick vodka infusions. I cleaned it up, these things are simple, remarkably well built and started making quick infusions from vodka or whiskey. You can enhance almost any kind of liquid with this method because the nitrous oxide in the chargers is inert. I have a full description at ilikethis.com"
4,Nice Cool Down,The pool is just the right size to just sit and cool down. There is enough room for a couple of adults to sit and have a some kids playing (just like the picture.) Yes the filter is a joke. We did not use chlorine base chemical system and just needed water movement. So it worked for that.
1,Didn't work,"Good idea , just doesn't work for older kids. Alarm comes unplugged while sleeping, pad moves around some, as well as alarm doesn't wake a sound sleeper, which is main reason of bed wetting in first place"
4,many TiVo uses,"You should find this an easy read, in learning how to effectively use your TiVo. The company has spent a lot of time in trying to make the user experience as simple as possible.Carter gives hardware tips as to various accessory items you might want to hook up your TiVo to. Plus, you can find out how to use various listings offered by third parties. Notably AOL, which offers a neat Remote Scheduling of its TV listings. Talk about convenient.For those of you with DVD players, and especially recorders, sections of the book describe how you can hook these up to the TiVo and get everything working with each other. And remembering that a TiVo is a special type of personal computer, you get instructions on how to upgrade its disk. Very good for the heavy user."
4,Learn about automated theorem proving in one weekend,"So you wanted to know how automated theorem proving algorithms work? This is a ""hands on"" book that tells you just that and gives you the sources of a program that implements these algorithms. The book is a cross between giving you theory and telling you about the included programs. As such it is a fast read and is great to learn the basic concepts. Its short comings are that you sometimes need to reread a paragraph a few times because it is written in a fairly terse style. The code is meant to work under unix but compiles and run well under windows visual C++ although one program does not work fully (COMPILE)."
3,a voice teacher and early music fan,"IT'S NOT THE VOICE THAT HAS ME COMPLAINING; IT'S THE SELECTION OF TUNES THAT I FIND DISDAINING!My problem with this disc has nothing to do with David Daniel's singing; rather it has to do with the line-up of songs. Some of them simply do not suit his voice. I really don't want to hear him singing:""My Shining Hour""-""A Simple Song""-""Beautiful Dreamer"" or ""Shenandoah""; and I'm not really fond of hearing the ""Ave Marias"". Not that he didn't do justice to them;he did!But the remainder of the selections were perfect for him and I think the contrast between the 2 genre is hard to take. The great songs on the album are great indeed:the 3 songs by Bellini;the 2 songs by Dowland;2 songs by Purcell and Martini's ""Plaisir d'amour"". I would still buy the album for these songs alone for they are performed with skill and emotion. Skilled musicians: Daniels & Ogden!"
3,Just OK,"I think David Daniels voice deserves more instruments to accompany his beautiful voice. The accompaniment was just too simple , not rich enough."
2,Unless you like Bernstein...,"This disc will be painful to the ears. I love Daniels' voice - strong, fluid, clear, especially pleasant in the low to mid range. And his stage presence made the touring Julius Caesar plain fun. But the Bernstein songs on this collection are not melodious and a jarring contrast to the title track and the older pieces. I found myself skipping tracks after the first listening. It was enjoyable, one time, to hear the two versions of Ave Maria for comparison, but they also seem out of place on this secular album. At least he does not take either one ""over the top"" the way some well-known tenors are wont to do; kept it under control and almost ethereal, as befits the subject. ""Shenandoah"" is perhaps the strangest pick and not a good choice, lacking the flowing sense of the lyrics and melody - it just didn't sound like a languid river flowing to the sea. Daniels' other recordings are a much better showcase for his voice and presentation."
4,Very Satisfying Cinema,"All in This Tea is a modest film well worth the attention of all who take pleasure in a well-crafted, information-filled documentary. The subject here is David Lee Hoffman who over time created a significant tea importing business out of a vagabond love of Asia and an appreciation for fine, hand-cultivated tea. All in This Tea also includes sublime footage of rural China and an exploration of the difficulties of functioning effectively in that country as an American entrepreneur. Replete with a cameo appearance by erstwhile Les Blank documentary subject Werner Herzog, All in This Tea provided this viewer with a highly enjoyable hour of entertainment and edification."
4,Very Interesting Documentary.,I have visited tea farms in China and in Taiwan. The documentary showed many things that happen in the background that I was not aware of. A well done and interesting documentary on Tea and on China. We watched streaming on Netflix and its also on Netflix dvd. I see Amazon is streaming it at a reasonable price too.
5,A must read for ALL baseball fans...,"Just an UNBELIEVABLE book...the stories from both the most popular Yankees (Rizzuto, Ford, Berra) to the back-up catcher on the five straight championship teams in the 50's are all must-read. 18 chapters on 17 men (1 women - Arlene Howard, the widow of Yankee great Elston Howard) covers the all-time greats and the not so recognizable players. Modern guys like Jackson, Pinella, and O'Neil make sure that all eras are covered. The best baseball writer in the NY papers, has penned one of the best baseball books I have ever read."
5,homerun,I think this is the best book that I ever read. I couldn't put this book down. This is a good book for die hard Yankee fans or just people who love baseball. Bill madden goes out to find players from past Yankee seasons. This is a good book I recommend this book for all baseball fans.
3,Missing episodes?,"I love this show very much but does anyone know why the last 3 episodes of season one are not on the dvd? Very strange. Had to watch them on YouTube. Also, the special features are not as they are listed on the packaging."
3,Really Cute Show,This show is fun to watch but it's not going to blow you away.***Spoilers***Apparently no one really liked Samantha (except for her stuck up friend Andrea) prior to her being hit by a car which caused her to have amnesia. She had a good job and boyfriend but when she began discovering herself again she found out that she really didn't like her job (and was eventually fired) and that she was cheating on her boyfriend. When her and her boyfriend broke up all she did was want him back but he had moved on with another girl...while living in Samantha's apartment?!?!Her chubby childhood friend came back into her life and I like that they added her character into the show...I hate when everyone in a show has to be perfect looking. So the first season is just Samantha trying to remember her life and discover who she is now...that and the pursuit of her ex boyfriend. Of course being a Star Trek fan I have to say that I loved the doorman!!!
3,Improved Over Time,"It took me awhile to warm up to this show as it often doesn't strike me as particularly funny, especially after watching ""Hope and Faith,"" which is hilarious every show. Since I purchased all of ""Samatha Who,"" Season 1 on DVD, I continued to watch the episodes. What started endearing me to the series were the characters. My favorite show was when the mother and the best friend toilet papered the mom's old high school rival's yard. Just the thought of a grown woman doing something like this is a hoot.Overall, it was worth purchasing and was entertaining. Haven't decided if I'll go for Season II or not, although amnesia is a very intriguing subject."
5,Excellent offering,This DVD is an incredible journey. This picks up where the last one left off (Hell Yeah). This in the fourth and last in the series (not counting Austin vs. McMahon: The Whole True Story or Lord Of the Ring). The first two are 'Cause Stone Cold Said So and Austin 3:16 Uncensored.This DVD is culled from mostly 2001 moments including his triumphant comeback from neck surgery. I would have like to have the match with Rock from WrestleMania X-7 in full here because it is just that good.This is my favourite series from WWE/WWF featuring arguably their most talented performer. The Ent. did not realize how good they had it and starting [messing] with his character and sticking him in secondary storylines.
3,There wasn't enough history of himself and his background..,"I remember seeing him for the first time in the ring as 'Stunning Steve Austin'. It was when I was in high school. I was either a sophmore or junior back in either 96' or 97' at 17 or 18. It was watching WCW and it was around the time Scott Hall, Kevin Nash, and Hulk Hogan fromed the NWO.I liked him. I liked that personality. He was cauky, energetic, brash, and arrogant. I wanted to see more of that side of him. I would've enjoyed seeing him get interviwed as 'Stunnng Steve Austin' or at least have him say a few words.Yes, I liked Steve Austin better as 'Stunning Steve Austin'. Also, more info and pictures on his past when he was growing up would've been nice.Other than that, this documentary was alright,Steve"
1,All about the GAME-TRIPLE H DVD will put this one to shame!,"jUST WAIT TILL June 25th when Triple H's DVD hits the stores. This will blow this Stone Cold WHAT? dvd or any other WWE DVD out of the water for sure. Us Triple H fans have waited a long damn time for him to come out with a new dvd/video and now we get it finally and it's sure to not dissapoint. I haven't seen this Austin dvd yet, but I plan to, but not before I see ""ALL ABOUT THE GAME"" with Triple H. The best in the business."
4,"Good read, if you're a musical nerd.","I'm using this book for my dissertation, I can understand why it'snot cheap, but it's worth it if you know what to expect from it. Don't buy it if you just want something to read in the bathroom, it's actually quite technical."
4,Great CD!,"This is a wonderful collection of songs from the movie, including some jamming hip hop along with gospel numbers and a very soulful song from Cristina Aguilera. The bits of dialogue inserted into a few select numbers are insightful and a bit heart wrenching. The only disappointment for me was that during the credits in the movie, there was a song which was a mix of an Elton John song with Tupac (yes, really) and that is not on the CD."
3,Ok companion to the doc,"The Music here is featured in the documentary and is composed by some of the subjects. It is not the greatest music, but it is decent to listen to. Great for a dire hard fan of clown dancing and krumping."
5,Absolutely wonderful.,"I purchased this wonderful movie that my wife knew about from amazon.com to enjoy and watch over the holidays with my family. I wasConcerned that I wouldn't get tt in time but amazon got it thereQuickly, and I mean quick. Thanks amazon for being quick andEfficient. Mike."
5,A classic,"I wish I could write a personal review on this movie, but I have never seen it. However, I would like to take the opportunity to say that my Aunt was hunting hard for this movie, and if you know her like I do, it must be an excellent movie."
2,MEH!!!,"Vengence Still Sucks. I paid for it on PPV, and felt extremely gypped. Vince McMahon sure messed up the title unification. They would have been better off putting the unified title on The Rock or Austin to give it legitimancy. As much as I like Jericho's work in the ring, his title reign followed by an even worse title reign by HHH sunk the company. Now the WWF is dead, and the WWE doesn't look too healthy. The end started long before this show, but it may have only accelerated the death of the WWE(F)."
2,Another Rushed PPV,"If you watched RAW the Monday after this PPV, you basically caught everything you needed to. It was just another rushed PPV like Backlash always is. However, it was the first appearance of the Underbiker's short hair in a PPV. Woooo. If you haven't seen it, it's definately worth the rent. If you buy it you probably want to own every WWF DVD, which totally reeks of awesomeness, or you want to have some proof that Jericho isn't the jobber he has become. One final note, the box art will probably feature HHH and in case you didn't know, HHH wasn't in this PPV."
4,pretty good,this was a pretty good PPV with a big triple main event with classic battles such as Matt Hardy vs. Jeff Hardy and Edge vs. William Regal. The Main event includes rock vs. Chris Jericho and Austin vs. Angle the winner of those matches faces the each other later in the night. There was surprise ending at the PPV a huge upset see it to believe it!!!!
3,wwe pay per view vengence,this was okay but not the best it is worth watching just because I a wwe fan and for my collection
5,A Timeless classic,A remarkable mix of hits that really grows on you. HIghly recommended for a neophyte country fan who want to sample some of the very best.
2,Mexico: A Traveler's Literary Companion,"Very mediocre content. reinforced my belief that few short stories are worth reading. Definitely would not recommend, even for Mexico lovers."
2,Tastes OK but there's high fructose corn syrup in it,Excitement about the salt-free content quickly abated when I saw that the Mrs. Dash marinades have high-fructose corn syrup (yuck) in them. Happily the spice mixtures do not.... those are great! The marinades work well with fish; less so in stir fry. Unfortunately I won't buy again because of the additives.
2,Someone else did the search engine research for you...,"As a friend of mine so eloquently pointed out, there's nothing in this book you couldn't get on your own if you spent some time at your computer fiddling around with different key word searches on the Internet.Being a freelance writer, I bought this book as a resource for doing research on housing topics. But I was disappointed. I was already familiar with most of the sites offered in this book and the sites I'd not heard of before were somewhat unimpressive.Some of the URLs that authors Pfeifer & Leebow list in this book contain a line or two about the site, but the vast majority of the URLs have no additional information, JUST the URL. It's basically 116 pages of line listings of home-related URLs with maybe a dozen cartoons thrown in.As someone who spends a great deal of time doing research on the Internet, this book was a disappointment. However, if you don't like Internet search engines, this book may be just what you want and need."
3,"For the newby, not the professional","I spent two weeks and learned Front Page 2000 and 2002. I got this book from the Library thinking that this would be an advanced book for Front Page Users. Opps, sorry, I was fooled. It was a good reference book. But things like Keyword and getting on search engines you left you wanting.But it certainly did solve my issue with forms and how to set it up and send it to an email address. I am now in the website business with Front Page. I am still looking for the book for Web Professionals."
1,Book not worth reading,"I bought this book based on its 5 stars ratings. I was hoping that this book would guide me build website taking me step by step. On page 26, the author gives you this false hope. After that the author just explains various features of the Front page and forgets completely about your website in progress. I picked up this book four times hoping to dig out the mysterious instruction related to this promised website. I failed every time. I ended up just getting rid of this book as I could not stand it any more."
4,Good Movie on a Great Subject,"Some parts Classy, some cheesy....but overall accurate. The Actors are pretty dead on but wouls have enjoyed even more music."
4,here they come,"well first off, i'm a huge monkees, fan, and know most of the history behind the group. so that being said, daydream beleievers: the monkees story, is pretty good. there are some creative liberties taken, bert and bob become one person, don kirshner being involved from the very beginning. and the really cheesy (and i really hate this word) ending. i guess if the filmakers had more money, more detail would have been given. i would like to see a miniseries on them one day. but all the actors are very good, recreating the essense of davy, micky, peter, and mike. their are some good special features, video interviews with davy, micky, and peter. but the best thing is the audio commentaries by the guys themselves. micky's is hilarious, davy's is really insightful, and peter's is a bit odd, he hardly talks, but offers some cool insights also. but any monkee fan will want this dvd edition, just for these commentaries."
3,"Good Movie, but what's with the DVD?","I saw this movie on VH-1, and I was pleasantly surprised. To be perfectly frank, I thought the movie was going to feature Davy, Davy, Davy, and more Davy (sorry folks, I'm not really a big fan of Davy). I was surprised to learn that Mike had a pretty big part in this. I'm also surprised they included a character of Mike's first wife, Phyllis.I was very disappointed when I bought the DVD. I had taped it off VH-1 the night it premiered, and then I bought the DVD for a better quality copy. For some reason that I can not begin to figure out, some of the scenes were edited. I had read the rating for this. It was rated PG-13 for drug references, but most of them were cut out. Why they did that, I have no idea."
1,They won't get respect from this DVD.,The stories; the history; the fame and self-destruction the Monkees have endured over their career.Were they manufactured? Yes!Did they play their own instruments? Damn right!Do they deserve recognition? Of course.Unfortunately this DVD does little for getting the respect they so rightly deserve for all they were. I felt like it was some Fan-boy slapping together all the interesting tidbits to impress all the people out there who believe the Monkees were milkeytoast and forgetable.I can't endorse this biography out of respect for the four parties involved...and maybe the producers should apologize for embarassing them.
4,I love this little movie!,"It's not really long enough, and it has an abrupt, too commercial-ly ending, but it's just SO CUTE & CHARMING! The guy who played Davey was great, but should have started out w/ shorter hair, then let it grow long, like Davey really did-and the guy who played Mickey was awesome, too, but Mickey started out w/ straight hair, not curly until season 2. (he did an AWESOME job pantomoming ""I'm a Believer!"")The guy who played Peter was a little too cute for the part, but still did wonderful. The guy who played Mike, tho, really NAILED it! He looked & acted SO much like the original! I grew up luvin the Monkees, tho I was just a little girl, and I'll always have a crush on 'em, especially Davey & Pete. MONKEES RULE!"
3,Nice Pictures,The book has really nice pictures in it but the story is only okay. If you love Wizard of Oz though you will love all the pictures he has in there. It is written by the Coroner munchkin.
3,Howard,the Plywood has delaminated already which given the price is not satisfactory. The unit is sturdy and built well otherwise but not sure how I am going to stop the plywood from deteriorating further or replace it when it all falls apart....
2,"Starts off beautifully, but then....","goes downhill fast from there. I was so excited when I started this novel, the writing was rich and evocative, the plot seemed solid and down to earth. Then Radhika Jha seems to have dived into a tailspin of teenage sex novel/poor pathetic woman, leaving our main character without a modicum of my sympathy. It turns from beautifully melancholy reality to Jaqueline Suzanne-esque pulp, (or should I say pap?) that left me desperate to reread the beginning to be sure I hadn't missed anything. I hadn't. I have no idea how Radhika Jha got from the beginning to where things turned ugly, almost as though she refused to finish the book and someone in the mailroom offered to take over from her. Despite this, I still hold out hope for future novels from this writer, as she has shown at the beginning of the book she is capable of both transporting the reader into her world, and of currying deep sympathy for her characters."
3,Definitely worth reading,"""Smell"" started off fabulously but it tapered off towards the middle and the conclusion was inexplicable in its blandness. I rather enjoyed reading Leela's story in the beginning but as time went on, it got a little bizarre and less interesting. There were a few issues left unexplained at the end, and I found that bothersome. That said, Jha's insight into a foreigner finding her way in Paris is startlingly clear. I enjoyed reading of Leela's exploits, and her uncanny sense of smell."
1,Should have read the reviews before buying this!,"The initial chapters were well written, and I was interested in the main character, Leela. However, the book quickly degenerated and the writing became terrible; it was hard to follow the characters' ever changing moods, and the characters for the most part are not developed. The book turns into a bad trash novel, with lots of descriptions of sex, but I don't feel anything for the characters.Leela seemed to be full of self-pity, as well as completely ignorant and vapid. She has no initiative to do anything, but instead is a completely passive person, waiting for others to take action. This one is going in the recycling bin!"
4,You can get lost in the character....,"I found this book to be extraordinarily descriptive and engaging. If you are one who prides yourself on your sense of smell, has a love of foods or are in the mood for the story of a life struggle with victories and heartache, this is a book for you.Set in Paris, but with strong Indian influence, this book will pull you in and at times make you uncomfortable for the character you become immersed in and then on the next page, cheer for her victories in the evolution of her tranformation of sheltered teen to a self-realized woman. A modern-day tale of struggle and celebrations and extreme hunger and satisfaction on both financial and emotional levels."
3,Smell it .. dont see it,"I started reading this book because I am myself from Indian orgins and living in Paris. That is why I guess I enjoyed all the descriptions (odors and visual) be it of the indians spices at Leela s uncle's shop, or the french baguette's smell or the streets of Paris ...But the novel as such hasn t been written in an evolutive manner, at one point Leela s life becomes boring...I would recommend to read it just for the descriptions, which had a new touch, because everything is 'smelled' and not 'seen'..Read it in english, because the french version is not that good, the vocabulary is very restricted, the french is very basic."
2,FROG FRIEND,"I love there forg earrings, but the wires are somewhat flimsy. I am afraid they will eventually break."
3,Classic Comic strip,"Winsor McCay's ""Little Nemo in Slumberland"" is a beautiful and imaginative comic strip from the early 20th century. For those of you who aren't familar with it, Little Nemo enters Slumberland each night when he falls asleep and dreams. There, he embarks on crazy, spetacular adventures.The reason I give this volume only 3 stars in that you can now get the complete series in one book for about the same price."
4,Read Greek Myths and Legends,"I had to do a report about Greek gods and godessess. I wasn't sure where to get these resorces until I came across this book. It was entertaining, humorous and very educational. If your ever having trouble finding info. on gods and godessesss, read this book! ? : > )"
4,Different from all the other résumé books out there.,"Kaplan's book presents powerful ways to describe certain experiences, skills, and qualifications. Should jump start your résumé writing and supply you with new ideas. Good for professional résumé writers who need phrases from many career fields."
1,PURE TRASH,I LIVE IN PUERTO VALLARTA AND HAVE DRIVEN TO EVERY PLACE DESCRIBED IN BOOK. THIS BOOK REMINDS ME OF A TRASHY BRUCE WILLIS MOVIE WHERE NOBODY CAN SHOOT STRAIGHT EXCEPT THE HERO. ALSO THE AUTHOR SHOULD KEEP HIS ANIMAL RIGHTS ATTITUDE TO HIMSELF. HE WOULD HAVE US FREE ALL THE ANIMALS IN THE ZOOS.
4,A good story to read,Among the adventourous books this is a relly good one. At least it made me wanting to read it and read it until the end without boring at all. Really well done.
3,Read more like a movie tie-in than a genuine novel.,"I got the impression when I was reading this that Mr. Waller was focused on the movie rights from the moment he first set pen to paper (or keys to word processor as the case may be). I did enjoy some of the detail about Mexican society and landscape, and the plot was strong enough to keep me reading to the end (although that may not have been true were this not such a short book), thus the three stars. But I, too, could not stop thinking that this was a novelization of a Bruce Willis or similar movie. The characters were a bit thin and the writing just failed to engage me. I wouldn't go so far as to call this trash, but there are so many more books that are more deserving of one's time and attention that I would not recommend this one."
2,"Pretentiously written, but interesting....","Waller's writing style is especially pretentious in this book, but if you get get past the first fifty pages it becomes interesting and the characters gather more dimension. His characters are so one-dimensional and cliched in the beginning that I was amazed how he managed to make them fully human by the end. I wouldn't have bothered with this if I hadn't been on a tropical island with no other english reading material, because the first part of the book is SO tiresome. (my demographic, BTW: US female, 30s)."
2,Unbelievable....,"Waller is usually awesome...but I think he missed it on Puerto Vallarta Squeeze. Not that I wasn't entertained, because I was...in a mindless sort of way. The book is a made-for-tv script just waiting to happen! But mediocre Waller is better than most at their best....so buy this book....used if possible."
4,A wild and wonderful read.,"Robert James Walker is best known for his famed romance novel, ""The Bridges of Madison County."" His writing consistently penetrates the passions and emotions of his readers - Puerto Vallarta Squeeze is no exception.In the famed Mexican resort town the lead character, a novelist with three strike, Danny Pastor, waits for a new infusion of inspiration to come to him. Until it does he lives down in Mexico ""squandering life."" He and his beautiful ""Puerto Vallarta Squeeze"", Maria de la Luz Santos, find themselves witnessing an polished and professional assassination.This is the beginning a thriller, killer a ride across Mexico to the American boarder. This fast-past, page turning thriller blends Robert Walkers hallmark of passionate storytelling with a contemporary Bonnie and Clyde twist. A wild and wonderful read."
4,"~A journalist, a hitman and a beautiful senorita~","I found this little book a pleasant surprise. Robert James Waller is difinitely a romantic kinda guy in more ways than one. His characters are so carefully crafted that one is sure they know someone just like them.The journalist, Danny is an American taking it easy for a while in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico. Living off his residuals enjoying the good live, he becomes involved with a beautiful young senorita, Luz, when one day a stranger comes into town and changes everything.Danny finds his world turned upside down but wonders if this situation, albeit a dangerous one, could be the start to a new project that might just bring him the fame and money he had long been dreaming of?If you are a fan of the author, check this one out it's a quick little run for the border."
4,A winner!,"I loved this book. ""Squeeze"" is better than ""Bridges"". The character are real. The story is very suspenseful and sexy. A must for readers who like stories about real people in real situations. If you read for pleasure and not to show your friends how intellectual you are, you will love this book"
4,One of Wallers best !,I like these kind of storys and sent my brother this book.An ex-vietnam sniper / warrior is an assasin and is running from the law with 2 innocent lovers caught-up in his escape to the States.
2,Almost a good game for kids,"The premise seems simple enough. However, the functional set up of the board is too complicated for this age group. The peg is difficult for small hands due to the lip at the bottom, which also prevents young eyes from seeing the holes they are trying to count. The holes, themselves, are too close together. It is very difficult for a smaller child to accurately count on this board. Finally, the game is boring to small children. After 6 or 7 turns, the child's attention span is gone."
2,Pegs in the Park,Great concept but the construction of the game piece makes it difficult for little hands (and adult hands) to count and accurately place the Peg in the hole. Peg should have a better design and maybe alittle more spacing between the holes.
5,If You love the Beetle - then You will love this book..,"This book on the Beetle from experimental stages in the 1930s to the last Mexican built Beetle destined for Germany in 1985.It has many photographs, drawings, advertisments and jokes from around the world in Black & white and color. If You are a Beetle lover, then You will get the enjoyment that I still get from reading this book over and over. It is One of My favorite VW Beetle books."
3,"Nice CD playing, Nice Tape playing, Poor radio reception","We bought this to replace our 10 year old Sony cassette/radio boombox. The new unit has some impressive features including a nice remote, clock radio functions, stereo enhancer, large backlit display, etc, but the radio reception wasn't as good as our old boombox. Plus, when tuned to our favorite AM station, there was a faint tone in the background. Oddly enough, pressing a button that changed the display would get rid of the tone, but it would come back again when the display defaulted back to the station.So, sadly, we are going to take it back.If you would like a compact boombox with a nice sound, and don't listen to AM radio, I would still recommend it."
5,Absolutely Beautiful,"I can't believe how hard it is to get a DVD of a performer who is so popular but this DVD is incredible. I've been a fan of Enya for at least 20 yrs and I'm so happy to finally have been able get a copy of this DVD. Even the interview with Enya is very moving as you hear her story and about how she and those who are involved in making the music and the videos; plus two special features on the making of the videos is very interesting. I feel this DVD is quite a soul stirring and heart warming experience. She is quite beautiful on the inside as well as the outside, it's a must for any Enya fan. Out of the countless music or concert DVD's I own, in all its simplicity and beauty, I can't think of any which is more personal and emotionally satisfying than this DVD."
5,Enya - The Video Collection USA Release Date,Does anyone have a clue when this dvd will be released in the USA? It was released in Europe a couple years ago. It is not out of stock. Thanks and still waiting.
3,'splosions,"Storage can be an issue. I used mine at work and it helped relieve back pain but I took it home later and stored it outside in a covered area and it imploded or exploded. I'm not sure which, but it wasn't pretty."
5,Review for Trisha Yearwood,I purchased this video a couple of years ago. This VHS tape includes live performances from her first three albums as well as footage of her discussing songs that had meaning to her. If you are a Trisha Yearwood fan then this is a must own!
4,No compromises,"The novel deals with the dramatic and obsessive attempt of a man, whose wife has just committed suicide, to convince his father-in-law that he is innocent of his wife's suicide although their marriage was a failure. The plot is wonderfully interwoven into a great thriller. The brutal and vicious fight between the two men, Coleman and Ray, makes the attentive reader sit up and read on. The novel also includes a vivid description of the setting of this novel: Venice! The world of the two artists seems to be a very stark contrast. Both are trying to be very strong and represent their interests passionately."
2,Highsmith's Worst Book?,"This was largely unrealistic, pointless, and seriously dated. (Why on earth would these characters' photos be highlighted in newspapers?) Highsmith has many better books than this one so save your money or skip this entirely."
5,Smart and Sexy,"Marie-Elena graciously takes you inside the history and lives of the Dominican people. You will visit the island's original Carib people who discovered Columbus when he arrived in 1493. Yes, be careful because you may actually learn something by reading this novel. Don't worry. Marie-Elena weaves a wonderful tale that will also feed some of your thirst for sex and action, while simultaneously increasing your knowledge of Africa and the Caribbean. She explores the African heritage that has been preserved in the Caribbean for over a century through rituals and everyday life. She also touches on the similarities and divide that exist between Africans, Caribbeans, and African Americans here in America. Overall, Marie-Elena John has written a wonderful novel that entices and intrigues. It is a must read for this summer or anytime you want to take a trip to the beautiful island of Dominica."
5,Couldn't put it down,"I will admit that you have to be intelligent to read this wonderful book. Marie-Elena John trusts that her readers won't appreciate being spoon-fed, and will enjoy the challenges she throws at us. She delivers a page-turning adventure to places and psyches that many of us have never experienced before.Bit by bit, she unravells a plot that rivals any cliff-hanger; but it was the DEPTH of this book that took my breath away. Buy this book for a rich experience that will stay with you long after you read the final line."
1,Flat and stereotypical,I struggled reading this book.the story is good overall but disjointed and fragmented.Lillian I found flat as a character.the ending very disappointing but predictable.
1,Should be Burnable,"I bought the Kindle edition of this novel, and in something that is in rare form for myself....I returned it 3 days later.The writing style is very difficult to follow, alternating between the past and the future, and the main character Lillian is incredibly BORING. After 12 chapters I gave up. Unfortunately I didn't have the patience to read it through to the end to see why it has such rave reviews, but I can't imagine it getting much better than what I read."
5,This CD Soothes My Hectic Life!,"I spend a great deal of time in my car and am usually in a hurry or on a tight schedule. I recently purchased this CD at the suggestion of a friend. I love it, as it really lifts me up, soothes my soul & quiets me to be more aware of God all around me! To listen & enjoy such a wonderful, sincere voice and feel good afterwards is a bonus!"
2,Lacking in Details,"This book does a good job of telling you what your IPAQ can do but a very poor job of telling you how to do it. I wanted more information about how to set up my IPAQ to connect with the internet. The book told me it could be done and how wonderful it was, but lacked specific information about which screen to go to and how to actually make it work.I later purchased IPAQ for Dummies. This book told me what the IPAQ could do and specifically how to do it. It was great. The Dummies book also gave lots of information on programs that are very helpful to add to your IPAQ.I was disappointed with IPAQ Pocket PC but very happy to get my hands on IPAQ for Dummies!"
2,Not great for WM 5.0,"I bought this book before I got my iPAQ in the hopes that it would give me a head start on using it, but there isn't enough detail on any instructions to actually be able to use the manual. For example, it says includes Windows Mobile 5 model info, but when I wanted to find out how to adjust the Program vs Storage memory slider, it only refers to previous Windows versions. Also, there is a lot of information on how to use your iPAQ phone, which of course I do not have the phone version. Basically a useless book."
3,not up to date,"The book is a blend of mediocre information. You would expect from a book published in 2006 that it would be all about Windows Mobile 5, it is not! Besides it mixes up the old and the new in the same paragraph! It is utterly confusing. You would expect at the very least a delineation between the two. I was expecting a lot more"
2,VERY LITTLE ON IPAQ,"IF YOU ARE BUYING THIS BOOK FOR SOMETHING RELATED TO AN IPAQ....FORGET IT....BUT IF YOU NEED SIMPLE HELP WITH WORD, EXCEL OR OUTLOOK....THIS IS YOUR BOOK....."
1,"How to Do Everything with Your iPaq Pocket PC, Third Edition","Have had both the iPAQ and book for about a month. Have gone to the book many times for answers to problems I am having in how to use the iPAQ. To date, I have had NO luck finding any answers. The book is a total waste of time."
1,Complete waste of money,"I agree completely with the ""severe tech phobia"" post. This book is outdated, grossly incomplete and often inaccurate. Pages of descriptions of perpherials you can buy, and discussions of games you can play, but completely lacking in knowledge, tips or facts to make the transistion to a newer IPAQ easier. Setting up email on this device (which has to be the most used application for a handheld), gets three pages of fluff, no substance. It is one of the poorest peices of writing to cross my desk in recent history. Current price is $.40 used, and that is overpriced. There is a great opportunity for someone to write a useful manual on this subject, but this is an opportunity wasted. The clunk you hear is this book hitting the trash."
5,How to Do Everything with Your IPAQ Oicjet OC,"Excellent! As a new user of an older model IPAQ with NO documentation, this book got me up and running very quickly."
1,Do not buy this book,If you know anything about your Pocket PC then DO NOT buy this book. I bought thinking that I could learn something from it but after using my pocket pc for a week before I bought this book and as I flipped through it I realized that it was a waste of my money and it would be a waste of yours as well.
5,understanding what this box is...,"This box is the cd version of every Jimi Hendrix Experience album legitimately released while he was alive, altered only enough to include singles from the same period. That's why there's some redundancy. Perhaps they could've added some tracks to each of the first three cds, and not needed the fourth, (with it's repeated tunes), but this format is preferable to me. Yes it's expensive, but it can be found used at lower prices , and the added written material,(a fairly thick booklet in each of the four cds), is excellent.I was looking for 'Electric Ladyland' on cd, but now will sell '..Experienced' and 'Axis' instead. Obviously the music speaks for itself."
3,Good bra at the start...,"I'd order a band size up to start. I've never worn a bra that minimizes so well. Huge difference in size when I wore it! But as the weeks and months wore on, the band started to give out and the wire started poking me. But it still supported pretty well and there were days I actually wore it, even though it was so uncomfortable. I looked that good. Suffer for fashion? You decide!"
3,not quite true to size,"I love Bali and I love this bra, but it is not quite true to size. The next time I would order a larger size. I typically wear a 34 C in Bali, but this one was snug."
5,Bali Seamless Minimizer Bra,"After wearing this bra (38C) I can't go back to wearing regular bras. Very good support and it does it's job of slightly minimizing while keeping the shape. Would HIGHLY recommend this one to anyone looking to minimize, very comfortable."
2,Tried too hard,"The pro: it kept my 2 year old's attention for most of the video; nothing offensive/contentious, all denominations should be fine with it.The cons: I was checking my watch less than 10 minutes in. It wasn't cohesive- it jumped around a lot. I get that they wanted to fit a lot of information (Jesus' entire life) into a short amount of time, but perhaps that was just too tall an order. There may be a reason why most cartoons break up His life into segments and you have to watch several to get the whole story. Probably won't be watching it again in my house."
2,Dry and Shallow,"From my perspective the Read and Share Bible DVD, The Jesus Series is nothing to get too excited about. The characters all look alike, there are uncomfortable ""dramatic"" pauses and it seems really shallow in the explanation of Jesus' ministry. My oldest child (6-years-old) even asked why they didn't show Jesus dying for us. ""That is the most important part"". If it were up to just me we would have sold it on the last garage sale, but the kids love it. My children 6,4 and 2 were riveted to the TV. Despite laughing at all the uncomfortable pauses they ask to watch it daily. What I have liked the most is that they ask questions about Jesus and His miracles. This video has opened up more opportunities to talk about Jesus and what he has done for us and for that reason alone I could not sell it. I received this book free from Thomas Nelson Publishers as part of their [...] book review bloggers program. I was not required to write a positive review. The opinions I have expressed are my own."
3,Read and Share DVD,"I was very interested to get the chance to review this for booksneeze. My family has a copy of the Read and Share Bible and was interested in seeing the video version of a few of the stories. I felt this could be a good way to get children more interested in the Bible. The animation for the video was good and fits really well with the way the pictures in the Bible copy look. What I didnt like though is they way they added little extras to the story that are not included in the Bible. I know they wanted the story to flow a little but I dont think you should add to the Word of God and confuse people.I have 3 boys and one sat and watched the whole video, one watched about half, and the other watched just a little. I dont know if that is any indication of how long it can hold a childs interest but I really just think it depends on the kids mood"
3,The Jesus Series DVD Read and Share,"As I viewed this animated adaptation of Jesus' ministry here on earth, I looked on with great expectation, similar to how I felt when popping in the tape for The Prince of Egypt. I was particularly excited to receive the DVD, looking forward to sharing it with my niece. This DVD was rich in color and characters, but lacked excitement that I think would keep a child's attention focused. I could follow the storyline because I'm very familiar with Christ's life, but question whether younger children would. I understand that it is simplified and told on a basic level, yet deem it important to keep the details in tact. It would be wonderful to extend this series out to five DVDs if necessary to get children to clearly understand Christ's ministry and miracles.This Read and Share DVD Bible is a great starting point and overall pleasurable as it shares God with the world."
4,The Jesus Series Life and Miracles Read and Share,I recieved the dvd Life and Miracles from [...]. My daughter who is 3 enjoyed the movie very much as we watched it together. The colors were very bright and engaging. It was a good way to show children the many miracles of Jesus. I liked the fact that we already have several other Read and Share products so it was a familiar format for her. I am excited to purchase the Christmas and Easter versions for her.
2,I didn't care for this.,"I received the DVD Read and Share Bible Life and Miracles (The Jesus Series) from Thomas Nelson's BookSneeze program. I got the dvd free just because I was willing to review it, but the views expressed here are completely my own.Read and Share Bible, Life and MiraclesWhat I liked:The animation of this dvd was cute.What I didn't like:The way the stories are delivered is a little boring.I thought that this was kind of corny and a little weird, for example, after Jesus heals one woman she gets up and tells Him that He looks thin, to which He responds ""that's because Peter told me about your cheese something or other"" or something to that affect and then she offers to make Him some and He offers to help her ""I know how to make the dough"", He says. Maybe I am just too serious, but I really did not like this part.My conclusion:I don't recommend this dvd.I give this a 2 out of 5 stars."
3,decent for little ones,"The ""Read and Share Bible"" DVD series introduces children to the life of Christ in a friendly animated format. ""The Jesus Series: Life and Miracles"" is a half hour long journey into the ministry of Jesus. Stories featured include; Jesus calling His disciples, The miracle of the loaves and fishes, Jesus healing the sick, and the Lord's Supper.I would recommend this DVD for the 3-7 crowd. The animation is simple yet vibrant. The stories are classic Sunday School, and would be great to introduce or review lessons in the church or home school setting. The kids that watched it with me (daycare children) seemed to enjoy it and were able to discuss what they had seen afterwards. I will admit that I got bored half way through with the repetition, but the time and pacing was perfect for the kiddos."
2,OE fit- NOT!!!,"This exhaust manifold is said to be a direct replacement for the factory manifold. Well, it is anything but. It does match the bolt holes but that is as far as it matches. The EGR tube is now about an inch off. The exhaust outlet is also slightly off which makes the exhaust pipe hit the bell housing. I have no way to make a new EGR tube. It is not flexible enough to bend. Stay away from Dorman unless you want nothing but headaches."
4,One Shot,"I found ""One Shot"" a typical Jack Reacher novel, which by Lee Childs style was suspenseful and detailed. I've enjoyed the series."
3,Run of the Mill.,"I would rank this with their chipotle sauce as being in the middle of the pack as far as hotsauces go. It's flavor is strong and tasty, but its lack of heat makes it limited in regards to utility. There are better products out there like Sriracha and Tabasco habanero in my opinion."
2,Disappointing A&E tape,"This is a copy of an old A&E 'Biography' program, starring Peter Graves. It is way too much Peter Graves and not nearly enough Jonathan Winters. The Amazon listing and the description are misleading in that they don't tell you this. I was hoping for a good compilation of Jonathan Winters live, but this was very spotty; more of his life, growing up, etc. I guess that's in keeping with the 'Biography' series, but the description gives no hint of that. The PBS program 'On the Loose' was much funnier, with more actual routines."
4,2nd in a good 3 part documentary,"This is not the type of documentary that you see on the history channel that tries to both inform and entertain at the same time.There are no CGI special effects, no attempt at showing you a day in the life of a prehistoric man, and very little in the way ofspeculation. When they say ""Just the Facts"", that`s exactly what they mean. Just what we know (or think we know) about early man.Great for high school science classes or anyone truely interested in early man."
2,Poor quality,This is a wonderful movie that I viewed on TCM. The problem with this dvd is that it is poor quality. I was not able to view it because of it's quality.
4,Penny Cincher,"I love these shoes! I bought mine in mid green (olive)and they are so comfortable and stylish. I think I may go back and buy the brown too.What is interesting is that these shoes did not call my name in the catalog. I thought the ""Fast Lane Walkers"" looked much more stylish but when I tried on both styles which are very similar the Penny Cincher is much more comfortable. The Fast Lane pumps have a stylish pointier toe that weren't that comfortable for my toes but the main difference is the construction of the arch/sole. Although these two styles look very similar the Penny Cincher has extra padding and you can really feel the difference when you compare the two styles. The Fast Lane are more stylish with the cute toe and stitching but the Penny Cincher is by far more comfortable. Even with a 2 3/4 heel they are comfortable and I generally go for 2 - 2 1/2 heels."
5,Comfortable Higher Heel Shoe,"I purchased these shoes in brown leather, black leather and mid green suede. These are great shoes. I ordered them all in size 7.5. The mid green suede felt like they were about a size too big and I ordered another pair in the same size and they fit fine. I don't know if they were marked incorrectly or what the problem was with the first pair. They fit really well and true to size. I wear them to work all day and they feel great. I usually wore flat dress shoes with dress pants but started wearing higher heels again. I think they look better with dress pants rather than skirts and dresses, atleast on me. I have to do alot of walking and they don't bother me at all. I would definitely recommmend these shoes. I also purchased the Fast Lane in different colors and kept the brown leather and the red suede. These Penny Cinchers are definitely more comfortable rather than the more pointed toe on the other style."
5,The Healing path,This is a great book for those who have been hurt growing up .This can help you to get past it .I would recomend this book to any one who is trying to move on in life and feels like they are being held back .
5,"Great author, great book!",This is a very interesting book--after I read it I wanted to read all of Allender's other publications. He is a great author and this book was very hard for me to put down once I started! A great book for any Christian who has ever faced challenges in their life.
2,NOT WORTH IT,Only Because SHe has so Much Depth&feeling in Her voice do I Give it a Two.but the Mixes don't add nothing to the already Established Foundation on The Original Album.I Never Have Liked Re-Mixed albums Because they Usually Mess up what has been Established.this is only for DIe-Hards.
2,Bleh.,"""What's The 411?"" (featuring Biggie), ""My Love"" and ""Love No Limit"" are all off the hook remixes. The rest are pretty boring. Yawn. Puffy did a terrible job on ""Changes I've Been Going Through."" Turned a really nice song into generic background music. ""Real Love"" and ""Reminisce"" I listen to once in awhile. There is no remix for ""Slow Down,"" a song from What's The 411? that I liked pretty well. Instead it was replaced with some other song I never heard of before. Die hard fans only."
4,Mary's Hip Hop Album,"What's the 411 proved to be one of the best albums in 1992, so its no surprise they released Whats The 411 remix, a heavily hip hop influeced album, released in late 1993. Its a nice album, although some of the remixes just dont do justice to the original. This is a nice collection for fans of Mary and hip hop. It includes 11 of the 12 songs as remixes on here, and one new track. I reccomend this album."
2,I'm not very happy with this remix.,I'm so dissapointed. I love Mary J. But the remix wasn't all that. I think they could have done much better!!!!!!!
2,Oh no......,"Thought it would be a nice twist to the oldies, but I'll stick to the originals.. Will be at CD Warehouse to sell this one asap."
2,Something for true Fans,"This album is strictly for Mary fans. It does no justice to the original. Most of the songs don't really sound different than the original, and in some cases, sound worse (like ""Sweet Thing"", Changes I've Been Going Through"", and I Don't Wanna Do Anything""). The best cuts on the album are ""You Don't Have To Worry"" f/ Craig Mack, ""My Love"" f/ Heavy D, ""Real Love"" and ""What's the 411?"", both featuring Notorious BIG (RIP) and ""Reminisce"" f/ C.L.Smooth. The rest is filler."
2,"Okay remix of the ""411"" album.","Only a die-hard, hardcore Mary J. Blige fan will appreciate this CD. Most of the remixes do no justice to the original mixes. The remixes of ""What's the 411"", ""Sweet Thing"", and ""I Don't Want To Do Anything"" didn't excite me. However, it is worth the buy for the remixes of ""Real Love"" and ""Love No Limit"". Peace El-715"
4,It'sGreat! My third favorite of Mary's all time hit records,"I think that Mary's the 411 remix is off the charts and definitely the bomb! With a hit like ""My Love"", a song that my whole family knows you can tell that the album would be butter, it's just one of those songs that you know hey, the album is going to be a hit. But, that might be me, I love everything that Mary does, there's nothing that she did that I ever said, Oh that's just corny, so for me, I definitely loved it. Then, you got ""Real Love"", and ""You Don't Have To Worry"" most-likely a plantium hit as much as that was played when it came out. I would have given it 4 stars, not 5 because it's not my all-time favorite of Mary's 5 records. But Mary needs more love than she's been given."
1,Recording Quality Terrible!!,"This audiobook cd is a WASTE OF MONEY because you CAN'T HEAR IT!!! I'm not sure if something happened during the recording of it, or if they thought it didn't need to be loud because people might only listen in their cars. I bought this to use in my classroom during the reading of the play. We could not hear it-even at full volume on my CD player. I even tried it on my surround sound stereo at home-same thing. This is a poor product-SAVE YOUR MONEY!"
1,very little christmas feeling,"I expected Ernie to perform at least several christmas songs, but most part of this cassette is talking around with his guest. If someone wants to see Rin Tin Tin and Lassie it's ok but I was missing totally Ernies excellent performance as known from his records. I was disappointed with this videoWould recommend instead Ernie Ford Amazing Grace VHS where he performs his gospel hits. This songs are cuts from several shows but without talking and joking."
5,A TV show that really is for the whole family,"The shows are wonderful! Heartwarming and unapologetically Christian in orientation; good music presented by professionals with warm stories and chats that only Erine could pull off.The tape its self was less than wonderful. It is a VHS made from the old films where they actually filmed a TV screen. I forget the name of that process, but it is dark and grainy. Too bad the old Ford shows can't be found in direct film format."
4,Dual-line Starter,"We got both this kite and the next size smaller to start flying last fall. Probably the biggest issue we had was guaging the wind. What the novice flyer thinks is 5mph is really only 2-3mph, and that makes a huge difference in kites. Not that I suggest going out in a windstorm, however, wait for a breezy day before you start running your lines out. The sail is fairly forgiving, so in turn it takes more wind to fly than just a light breeze.I haven't had a chance to get into tricks with it, but after flying on some mud flats, I'm pretty impressed with how the kite has held up. Its easy to put together and real similar in construction to the delta style kites. Just make sure to check the bridle knots after shipping, thats pretty standard. Also, if you'll be flying more than just a couple times, I definately recommend buying a set of real kite lines. 90lb/90ft is a good all-around set and you get to upgrade to some nifty straps instead of the winder handles."
1,Screen looks awful - Touchscreen almost non responsive,I ordered one of the screen protectors hoping to reduce the glare on my screen as well as protect it. This screen protector dulls the screen so it is not vibrant and also makes the touch screen near worthless. I expected the screen protector to work much like the one on my iphone 4. This screen protector totally changes the way the screen looks. I am in the process of trying to get a refund.
4,Awesomely written,"You know what? Model can write a book! Tyra is so down to earth and I found this book very educational although I am in mid twenties. There are a pile of make-up tips, even she gets into the issue of AIDS or relationship that lasts. She is an awesome girl, I tell ya!"
5,A Keepsake!,"I fell in love with this book since its release and highly recommend it. Sure, it contains tons of photos of Tyra, but this is the very nature of her work, people... HELLOOOOO. And it's obvious this book was going to focus on her by its title, it isn't called 'YOUR Beauty, Inside Out', now is it? Anyways, looking at her never gets boring because the pics are all varying in style and purpose. If you're a fan of Tyra or appreciate sexy-yet-wholesome beauty & personality then you'll cherish this book. It's one-parts autobiography, one-parts pictorial, and 1-parts self-improvement advice, the works mixed together! I get a strong feeling that this was the intention of Banks & Blake and I think it makes for a unique and fun reading experience."
5,This Is A GREAT book!,I am a typical teenager. This book made me feel better about myself when I was feeling badly about my looks or anything. This is a book that every single teenager should own. It is an EXCELLENT book!
5,The book was absolutely wonderful and very insightful.,I am an African-American young lady in my mid-teens and I am happy that a book has been published for us. For a long time we only saw the faces of non-minorities in print and on the runway. But now the modeling industry is slowly becoming a few shades darker. I appreciate this book very much and it is very rewarding.
3,tyras beauty,"i have to say that this book was filled with a few good facts, but most were things you could find in an edition of any beauty magazine and some are just plain old common sense! Also, while she stresses self acceptance, she plasters pictures of herself done from head to toe. Not exactly ""postive feedback"" when you read the line next to it saying love yourself as you are. I did enjoy the one of before and after the makeup, because it gives you a view of how much makeup can do. I found that most of the book especially the makeup section was rather plain and vague. It didn't really give a good description of things. In fact, looking back, there was far too many stories of her own skin and her own hair and her family to really make this book helpful to people that do not live in her family, have dry skin and dry hair (what she has)..."
3,Beautiful Photography,"I really wanted to get this deck, the Photography is lovely, and does seem to make the cards stand out. Reading however is harder with this deck. The black border cuts off much of the picture, and the wood framing in some make it a darker deck. The minor arcana is simply done with each suit's number. So there are no pictures , simply 2, 3 or 4 cups etc.... while i do like reading without pictures on the minor arcana, i think it would have been much more helpful, if at least the 5 of cups had two overturned, and perhaps a dark sky. In this deck all cups are upright, filled, and the sky is blue, giving a beginner reader absolutely no clue to the meaning. Its a nice deck, but not one ill reach for alot during readings. Karen"
2,Difficult Deck,"This is a difficult deck to read. The minor arcana cards are so simple in design that I could feel little to no impression off them. The major arcana cards are very well done. It's unfortunate that the minor arcana are so plain.I personally had difficulties in reading with this deck as it would rarely throw out cards that made sense in a given reading. I've not had this problem with my other decks. If anything, it seemed hostile at times.This could simply be that this was not a deck for me, and it could be wonderful for someone else. Personally, however, I would like to see just a little more detail in the minor arcana cards to make them less difficult to read."
4,The Best of Nancy Griffith,"This well-programmed single disc anthology is a perfect choice for the unintiated to experience the music of Nancy Griffith. Griffith is a folk artist who ocassionally infuses her music with a little rock and roll energy. What sets her apart from many others of her ilk is her ability to occasionally produce a catchy hook or two. This is particularly true on ""Listen to the Radio,"" ""Outbound Plane,"" and ""Love at the Five and Dime."" These are songs that can get your feet tapping while also engaging your frontal lobes. Like most folk singers, Griffith is unafraid to tackle the tough topics, like the failure of the family farm (""Trouble in the Fields""), and the debilitating effects parental racism can have on a child (""It's a Hard Life Wherever You Go""), but she mostly manages to do so without becoming too heavy handed.Overall, an excellent collection of songs from an underappreciated artist."
3,A 10 year old reader,Mr. DIXON died. I think people shoudn't critisize what he worked on so hard. But it doesn't have any mystery....but at least its good.
2,Honestly!,"I bought this book back in 2005. I had read many Hardy Boys novels before and I bought it because I didn't have a copy. Originally, I was trying to find the blue spined one, but I found an ""A FIGURE IN HIDING"", but it had a different cover that interested me. So, I ordered it and just looking at it told me: DIFFERENT STORY.HOWEVER,WHAT HAPPENED! THE BOOK IS DEFINITELY # 99 IN THE TOP 100 WORST BOOKS KNOWN TO MANKIND! IT'S BASICALLY the final few chapters of a Hardy Boys book expanded about 12 times!BUT,I gave it *** . 1.5* for being a Hardy Boys book and another 1.5* for being somewhat interesting until you get so annoyed you get a headache from the plot ( it gets more & more boring the more times you read it).ALL IN ALL...IT'S OK! Not the worst one in the series."
2,O.K.,"This book was all right, but I would rate it below average compared to other volumes in the set."

1,what's with the sexist manufacturer's description??,was about to buy this toy then read that it is good for little girls to make toast just like their mommy does. in what cave are they manufacturing this product??
4,A Solid Album,"Sonny Rollins' first effort for Blue Note is a solid, if not stellar, album. Recorded on December 16, 1956, ""Sonny Rollins Volume One"" features Donald Byrd on trumpet, Wynton Kelly on piano, Gene Ramey on bass, and the great Max Roach on drums. Roach, by the way, brings much needed cohesion to the recording. (At this time Rollins was member of the Max Roach Plus Four, so they knew how to play well together.) Unfortunately, Byrd and Rollins don't always mesh, and Sonny often pulls along Kelly. Otherwise, it's a spirited session featuring four Rollins originals, recorded (as always) impeccably, and now remastered too, by Rudy Van Gelder. It just seems that an album sandwiched between three of the greatest jazz albums of the 1950s (""Tenor Madness,"" ""Saxophone Colossus,"" and ""Volume 2"") would be better, but then we all have to be entitled to an off day. If only my off days could be as successful...."
2,Not What I Expected!,"The jewel case was badly damaged in shipment, and I despaired of having a flawless product. The CD came through in perfect condition however. I have used the cassette version of this product for many years to keep me on pace during my walks. When I played the CD, I noticed that the producers have considerably increased the pace of many of the selections, so I won't be able to use it any longer for my walks. Unfortunately, I had to open the package in order to determine this, so I'm out of luck as far as returning it is concerned!! Too bad they didn't leave a great product as it was. Sadly, it's not going to be my favorite any more."
4,work as advertised,"Easy to install. The door swings wide as expected. There is some play in the hinges, so the door alignment sags slightly."
2,Bad fit,"This hinge does not fit on standard pre-hung interior door kit. I had to take the 2 1/4"" colonial casing off and plane a good qtr inch off the back of the trim to make it thinner. The other option would have set the hinge out further than is safe.I also don't like that there is no option to purchase single hinges or a package of three. Most all doors today have three hinges."
2,Doesn't fit,"The customer service I received from Allegro Medical was great. The hinges arrived very fast. The hinges seemed to be very well made. However, they don't fit in my door and I won't be able to try them out. I think if they could fit in the door, they probably would have worked."
5,Gift and loved itl....,I bought it as a gift for my youngest Godchild who turned 11 and he loved it as his Dad is an alumn of ND....Sent timely and in perfect condition.
2,competent but unbalanced,"Kozinn's book is a competent summary of the Beatles' performance and recording career, and is refreshingly calm and balanced in its discussion of the causes for the Beatles' disbanding. It's a safe book for the relatively uninformed to read. But it fails in its stated intention of getting at the ""mechanisms"" of the Beatles' innovative genius. Although Kozinn is genuinely appreciative of Lennon's genius, the book commits the common sin of dismissing McCartney's contributions as a sort of idiot savant knack for commercial melodies. Without getting more than about 20% McCartney into the Lennon-McCartney mix, you really can't get a grip on the songbook or the remarkable recording revolution these two young men were responsible for. A more accurate title would have been ""John Lennon and Other Musicians."""
3,TEXTBOOK of YOUNG BEATLES' FANS,"If you are not a Beatles fan in the 60's or you just start listening to them recently, this one is suitable for you to make a study on them. Though the events recorded are quite general and already very 'well-known', the book should still be in the collection list of Beatles fans. Also, if you don't know anything about the Fab Four, you should read this before reading the biography of each of them"
1,yuck,"i can't tell you if it works in terms of hangover cure and/or energizer, because i haven't yet managed to swallow a whole can... tastes like a much stronger-tasting red bull"
1,DO NOT BUY FROM THIS COMPANY,If you actually would like to receive the item you purchased do not buy from this company !The parcel if you lucky enough for it to even arrive at all will get to you weeks after the promised delivery date and once it actually arrives the documentation is in such disarray as to prevent you from actually claiming it from the post office...I have to say you guys certainly left an impression on me ! I will never do any form of business with you again !
5,great utility belt,"great utility belt that can be used for any activity. Be it a ninja operation, security guard belt, work or daily personal utility belt. It is a multitask utility belt. I recommend this belt to anyone."
2,Not Quite right...,"The picture is not accurate for what you get in the mail. Its all one piece, there isn't clips at the ends to secure it. Its actually a very confusing piece, and I intend to probably fix or sew it myself."
1,"The ""PROSELLER"" Is a Con Artist!","I bought this product, it arrived in less than 24 hours, and it was the wrong thing. They sent me a black hunk of plastic and it wouldn't read a card or anything. It looked like they handwrit pny on it with a crayon. It took a while for me to get a refund."
1,grandmas opinion,"I'm sorry but I do not really consider this pool a ""toy"" and of course not educational. It just makes life a little more enjoyable for me and gives my granddaughter something to do when she comes over."
4,Nice pool - but less expensive at Wal Mart!,"Pool was easy to set up and fill - one person could do it. Placed it on our deck (we have a very solid deck) with foam board underneath. It was up and ready to go within an afternoon. So far, so good - very happy with purchase!"
2,Filter came broken,We bought this pool for our family a couple months before summer. I guess we should have opened it immediately and tested it out but we didnt think there would be a problem. When we opened it and set up the poolIntex Easy Set 12-Foot-by-30-Inch Round Pool SetIntex 54911EG 8-Foot by 30-Inch Clearview Easy Set Pool with 110-120 Volt Filter Pumpwe found the pump was broken. Ace hardware wouldnt exchange past 30 days even though it had been unopened. The manufacturers warranty only applies if you purchase directly from them and is also only 30 days.I was very excited and it was a very quick setup but we will be unable to use this since the water will be bad in a couple days. Very disappointed with this purchase.
4,great pool for a small space,"I purchased this pool for my nieces & nephews so they didn't have to swim in the filthy local lake. It was very easy to set up-it only took about 30 minutes to unpack & place the pool, and then several hours to fill. The kids love it, and their parents will get in too too cool off. Unlike the tiny hard plastic kiddie pools that I had as a little kid, the water is deep enough to cool off in the summer. The kids are all still small, so the water is at least waist-deep for all of them. I would definitely buy this again, and as long as they get 1 more summer out of it, I won't hesitate to buy another one."
5,Pool,Perfect for my 16 month old. He wants to splash every minute. The beauty is that you can fill it up to what you feel is comfortable depending on the age. And it fits two adults and two kids just like in the picture
4,Perfect for a small back yard,"We have a relatively small back yard so this pool fits perfectly! It is deep enough that I can go in with my children to cool off too. The pump is such a wonderful feature and was the main selling point for me. It is wonderful not having to empty the water after every use. It is fairly simple to maintain the right chemical levels (chemicals are not supplied). I have learned, though, that you have to change or clean the filter quite often. To clean the filter, you have to unscrew the top, which will cause the pool water to pour out. The plugs they supply to prevent this from happening don't fit, so it takes one extra sent of very long arms to hold them in place. For that reason, I give only 4 stars."
5,great set!,Great pool for the price. comes with everything you need to set it up but a hand pump for the ring - that will cost you about $4.My 4 year old loves it because she can stand up and not be afraid...It is big enough for one adult and 2 little kids.Next year I'll buy the 10'.
1,Very thin bottom so be careful!,"I was so excited to receive this pool so when we unpacked and laid it down on the cement floor to fill in water, we noticed there were leakage. Well, turned out, the bottom had a little whole (maybe from a tiny pebble on the ground), so we patched it with the patching kit provided and that seems to work but then found out that the top ring air was leaking as well. I had to return it....my son were a bit bummed out. The side material were nice and thick but the bottom is very thin. Have to be extremely careful where you lay this pool....without the bottom protector mat, it will rupture easily."
4,Fun pool,Great pool for the backyard! The only flaws that I've found is that it doesn't come with a cover and it isn't very clear as to how much chlorine should be used. I had to go online and find out how much water the pool actually holds. Other then that it's a great pool to have your kids swim in.
3,KIDS LOVE IT (3 1/2 stars),"This is a great alternative to the regular 'small' backyard pool. Only problem I had was a small hole in the inflatable ring at the top which was hard to find, and a lack of information on maintenance such as chlorine and ph levels. A visit to my local pool store remedied that."
3,OK for the money,"This is a good inflatable pool for the money, but you have to make sure it is on ABSOLUTELY level ground. We worked on leveling an area, put it up and apparently there was a very small gradient on one side, so the inflatable ring at the top has become lop-sized and now the cover won't stay on. The weight of that much water really presses out on the sides, and I think next time we'll go with a reinforced pool or something with hard sides. It did the job and kept my kids cool and happy this past summer, but we most likely will not use it again."
2,Not worth the money,"We were thrilled to get what we thought would be a nice, sturdy pool for our young children. By the time we bought everything, including cover, tarp, chlorine, etc. we had spent over $120 and the pool only lasted a week before it had a couple holes on the bottom. We went and bought the patch kit to make it useable again only to have it leaking elsewhere. I really thought this would be a sturdier pool than the cheap blow up kind but I am so disappointed. I would have rather spent a couple hundred more and bought something that would last. My kids are so disappointed! I would never by this kind of pool again."
3,Inflatable Pool,"This product was great for about a week. Right from the begining it was leaking, at first slowly and then faster. If you live in florida and it rains a lot then you got a problem because it will be overflowing which could also cause damage. And do purchase a cover so leaves don't fall in.My kid was very disappointed that we had to get rid of this product."
2,Good Idea but.........,"The inflatable ring is made out of the thinnest and cheapest material I have seen. My family spends more time searching for holes in the plastic than we do actually swimming in the pool. If the ring deflates, the sides collapse and the water runs over the edge.The pool is cheap so it is hard to go wrong at that price, but keep in mind that you get what you pay for. Consider yourself lucky if it lasts an entire summer!"
5,This pool is great!,"We bought this pool for our son who loves it! According to another review on the site, the reviewer states it does not come w/the items it shows in the picture and the ad, however it does. She must have looked at a different brand. We bought the 8' model, and it has the filter, and hoses, and everything works great. It was easy to assemble, keep clean, and provides our young son w/a great summer activity."
2,Not happy,Item came fast enough...but the pump was defective...the filter did not line up with the motor outlet. Called Intex and they did nothing about it.
2,Only lasted 3 weeks,"This pool was great for three weeks. The inflatable ring started losing air and I found one puncture and fixed, but there must have been another hole because it would lose air within an hour. Can't find the other hole. I bought a 10'x 36"" pool for $60. I'm so glad I didn't buy a bigger one for $200. No more inflatables for me."
1,8' Easy Set Pool Sags Terribly!,"The 8' Easy Set Pool is great in concept, easy to set up. However, it sags terribly and does not look anything like the picture which shows the sides of the pool being firm. It probably needs additional inflatable rings besides the top, because the sides sag like crazy.The directions say that you must have a level place to put it, but for practical purposes my backyard is about as flat as they come. I requested a refund two days ago from CMS Worldwide Sales and have not heard back yet. I would definitely advise AGAINST buying this product.Union, NJ"
5,An excellently written book.,"Bell is an incredible author. Fantastic tutorials that were easy to understand and implement. There are better books out there for beginners, but for all you intermediate max users, you should have this book."
3,Appropriate For Specific Aims,"This book does teach the reader how to do certain things that come in handy, but you have to know how to get around in MAX to understand it. I found it useful, but only because I had spent the last month figuring out MAX by myself. Some ideas in the book are not particularly helpful, but there are many others that will enhance your pictures, and the CD comes with some useful plugins."
2,Not A Book To Begin With,I Hated This Book...It Was Not A Book Designed For People That Dont Know How To Use 3d Studio MAX. I could bearly get thru the first lesson without finding out everything for myself... Avoid this book if you are a beginner.
2,Not the book for newbies!,"I bought this book, a newbie, thinking It would greatly increase my MAX skills. Unfortunately, it turned out this book is NOT a beginner's book, although it is intended to be. I found it hard to use and somewhat frustrating. The CD has bugs in it, and some of the tutorials were hard to understand."
4,"Pretty good, but could be better!","This book was really worth the money, I only wish it could have been longer. The review below was right, the nurbs leaves something to be desired, so I give it a 4."
5,100% Fantasticly Amazing - not to mention Brilliant,"God I love this book. It's so damn great sometimes I just pick it up and hold it ;) No seriously this books material tutorials are indespensable. It gives such detail and precision I just can't find anything wrong with it. The greeble plugin seemed a little slow but what a fantastic plugin it is! I've been taking tips from it ever since I baught it and some of my work shows off it's brilliance. I'd always wanted to know about specularity and this book showed me. There is no exuse for not having it, I hope that the author sells a billion copies and makes another one for us so we can buy it and just have some of the darn best books ever. He's a great guy too mixing humor and jokes in with the descirptions making it feel like a freind is showing you what to do.Thumbs up my freind - you should be proud!"
5,Don't shoot the decoy!,"This decoy presents a realiatic appearance in moderate wind. Since it is wind powered, it is of course dependent upon nature's power. I've used it twice, and it worked as expected. However, the last two times out I came back empty handed, hunting in places devoid of any sort of ducks, so it's attractiveness to the birds is still to be tested. Potential shortfalls for the long run are that it's bulky size when assembled requiring disassembly of the wings (easy to do) for transportation. Care needs to be taken to not bend the wing supports, or the wing will not spin. The support pole is easy to push into the ground, but it is hollow--and hence it fills with mud, and will eventually rust out the support pole. I will plug the end of mu support pole in the off season to forgo the rust issue somewhat."
5,Very Informative,"I purchased this DVD for my wife who has recently upgraded from a compact digital camera. It primarily covers the use of the four manual modes on the camera as apposed to the camreas automatic settings. We have found it to be very informative in this respect and alot easier to follow than the Nikon manual that came with the camera. Combined with the other tips in the DVD,eg one third composition technique, it has helped her alot.It states on the Amazon site that this is a North American region DVD but we have had no problems playing it here in New Zealand."
3,Visual instruction on use of Nikon D80,This is a helpful guide to familiarize you with the operating system of the Nikon D80. A visual learning tool to reinforce the applications. This camera has so many bells and whistles to utilize that you just have to practice by using each step outlined and then apply them to your photography before moving to the next step. Also a good review if you have not used your camera recently.
2,flimsy bike,"You get what you paid for. Not a very solid bike, with low quality components. If you are thinking of this, go to target or walmart, and buy one of their bikes. I regret not having spent $40 more, I could have bought a Schwinn from amazon."
3,joc's bike,"It's a good bike for the price. I had another bike that costed about $25.00 more and it was much better. In general, I'm satisfied with the bike and the delivery."
3,parts of the bike is not durable,in the first few daysi have to change the pedals the tires and some tiny parts too...it's weird for a new bike
5,jesse james,the dvd is great but the delivery takes too long otherwise very impressed with service and item.
4,Great bike and Great Story!,"Really enjoyed this documentary, this film shows a side to Jesse James that I think many people never see. This isn't just about motorcyles, it's a about a life's work and journey"
3,Enough with the drama,"Great opening, some of the best camera work i have seen of any of the Motorcycle mania dvds. I feel way too much time is spent on Jesses dramas with wives, ex wives, and girlfriends, its interesting to know what hes upto in his personal life but the camera spends too much time covering this side of his life, lets bring on the bikes, cars, and metal work, areas where he excels."
3,OUCH! That Hurt!,"Ugly stories about ugly people. That about sums it up. Perhaps that was the author's intent? Beats me. So much ugliness in such a small space is hard to endure, which is why I give less than five stars. Now Unamuno was bright and could write, and that is why I give more that one star."
3,If you want gossip in gory detail-don't look here,"I had always heard of Missy Hyatt, but wasn't really familiar with the character so I bought the book. I had heard that it was full of information and all the goods in just about everyone in the wrestling business both past and present. There are some unexpected statements, but nothing is written in the book that isn't said on a typical girl's night out. The book is written in a very conversational tone, by a very forthright author. As it concludes the reader feels as if Melissa Hiatt told the story of a character and where that character tok the real person through the years. It also leaves the reader in in wander, wandering ""what the hell was she thinking all that time?"" Overall it is a good read for a lazy afternoon, but won't be something that will be taken along as a life lesson."
2,Very disappointing. Not worth it.,"If you are looking for the scandalous tale that the book promises, look somewhere else. This book is poorly written and trite. There should have been a lot more stories than there really were."
4,Entertaining but a little short.,"I actually really enjoyed this book, as it lets you in on alot of inside info. She probably could have elaborated a little more on her WCW days as well as mentioning her WrestlingviXXXens website. She comes off as very gossipy, but it seems that deep down she is a very nice person. Good read, and I bet ya that Jim Kelly (bills qb) is catching flack."
3,not as juicy as I thought!,"I always liked Missy when I was a kid. I remember the infamous gucci purse and I loved the fact that she wasn't just some helpless female or eye-candy. However, Missy makes herself out to be more than she was throughout the whole book. I mean she was in some rinky-dink federations most of the time and in the wwf long enough to choke. This book is basically about how great she is and why everyone else should think so. When I think of The First Lady of Wrestling, I don't think Missy Hyatt. Hell, when I think of a Lady, I don't think of Missy. If you were an Eddie Gilbert fan or just like to haer about how organazations were run back then, you'll like this book. Otherwise, I wouldn't buy it."
2,Not so good,"This book is not as in depth as Mankind,Dallas Page, are Goldbergs.......and not very good either. Would not recommend spend your money on this book."
3,Could be longer,"If you like gossip about your favourite wrestlers than this is the way to go. The only down side to this book was that I finished it in a day and a half as I couldnt put it down, so it definetly could do with being longer or at best Missy could do with putting out another book as there was nothing mentioned about her website and stuff like that."
3,Missy Hyatt Book,"This book certainly did not live up to the hype it produced for itself nor does it compare with the books by Foley, Dynamite, etc. However, it is a very interesting and fun read if you don't mind Missy taking credit for every big angle in the last ten years. I would recomend anyone who likes the 80's era to read it. It is fun to read just not as good as some other books."
2,Not worth the price..,"Not one of the best wrestling books out there (Bodyslams by Capetta, Pure Dynamite are better).. Full of fluff, not much substance... No real inside info..more like cheap gossip... Skip this book... or readit in the store.. Its so short it might only take u an hour and a half."
3,something was missing.....,"Not quite the ""tell all book"" you think it is. Sure she talks about her many sexual escapades...... but I think that she left a lot out. Warning, anyone who is a Jim Kelly fan will never be able to look at Jim the same way ever again."
3,dont forget the screws,i just bought this for my nephews pre school class and the second review is quite right if the box is damaged the screws are gone
4,"Good theater, some assembly, missing parts","I just assembled this theather for Christmas morning. Overall I would other reviews in saying it is nice looking, durable, and fairly large (perhaps 4' wide, 4'8"" high, 2' deep. It is all red painted wood with a chalkboard n the front framed in yellow. It comes with a curtain -- although the curtain rod (about a 5/8"" thick and 4' long dowell) was missing so we had to go find one at a hardware store.I almost couldnt' find the hardware which comes in a small white box that is easily lost in the styrofoam packaging.Assembly is perhaps 10-15 minutes of work if you have all the parts. 12 bolts hold it all together. Nothing else needed."
3,Not for everyone,"It's a good costume piece and looks good from afar. However, the symbol literally looks like a cutout drawing that was super glued onto the hat. You could see some of the glue sticking out. But for my World War II replica collection I'm perfectly fine with it. Its a bit expensive though and you can't track the package until two days before it arrives. But, at least it arrives a day early"
1,Angry mob will attack you!,"I wore one of these hats along with a costume on Halloween with some other friends also with this hat and a costume. We went to a house and rang the door bell. A guy open up and instead of ""Trick or treat"" we say ""Hiel Hitler."" The guy got pissed and said something in Hebrew. Then he slammed the door on us. We went to the next house and said ""Hiel Hitler."" The guy here got pissed to and also said something in Hebrew and slammed the door on us. We turned around to see a bunch of people with the hates that Jewish people wear. Suddenly they started running toward us and we ran to the left we ran kinda fast because 3 blocks later they were half a block away. We hid behind some bushes and they passed us and didn't notice. That was the last Halloween we went to. Later we found out it was a Jewish comunity."
5,Anne of green galbes,"This book has been wonderful, I feel just like AnneShirley, she's so nice and there are so many funny things that happen to her, if you really want a nice book, pick up this one"
3,To large to carry with you,Do you take a book with you to appointments in case you have to wait? Well while the Anne of Green Gables serious are great just for fun reading...you will not take this book with you. And the print is a bit small. The good part is you will have 3 books in one place that is hard to lose.
5,I Love Anne and her Adventure,"I'm a fan, I admit that and have been since I was a child. After watching the original series over and over for years, I decided to pick up the box set of books. Wow, what a delight. It's nice to learn more about each character and their adventures as more detail is given than what was ever put into the series. Love it!"
3,Anne with an E,"The size and shape of the Three In One Set is a paper back book 8"" x 10"" x 1.25"" and weighs 2 lbs,3 oz so it is not very handy to use or take with you. The content is fine. I thought I was buying three regular paperback books."
1,"Sorry, that's not Anne.","Huh, I guess I missed the chapter where Anne bleaches her hair and has professional head shots taken to send to her modelling agent."
1,Any edition but this one.,"The entire Anne series is wonderful--I cannot think of a better role model for girls growing up. I am even planning a to visit P.E.I. this summer with my daughters in homage to this beautiful series. But this cover is the most offensive thing I've ever seen. Anne is a young redheaded girl, gangly and awkward and real. This blonde, modernly dressed teenage model has no place whatsoever on the cover of this book. Buy the Anne books and love them, as girls have for generations, but NOT this edition. Absolutely offensive to the spirit of Anne."
1,Anne of Green Gables is not blonde!,"How irritating it is to see a CLASSIC series be sexualized and the image of the girl on the front doesn't even correlate with the main character! Anne is not a blonde, nor is she a farm girl and she definitely does not ooze sex appeal! This is a terrible, terrible cover choice for a book and whoever made that final decision to run with this cover should be strung up and shown what good book covers are like."
1,Michelle Williams is Not Anne Shirley,"Here's the thing about Anne Shirley. She's awkward and I'd dare say she feels worse about herself than you do but she has so much spunk and she will teach you that just because you're a redheaded orphan who is not wanted, you still got to stick up for yourself and love yourself even though it's really hard. What she isn't is SEXY. She is a girl. A FREAKING GIRL who falls down in laughter a lot and loves her best friend, Diana, deeply. She loves everything deeply. She is this character who makes you realize that life may not always be right or fair but it is worth living to your fullest. What she is not, is a freaking whore who apparently lives down on a 1920's farm in a plaid shirt, sitting on a tractor. And most of all, Anne was and is and will always be A RED HEAD.For the love of all things holy do not buy this series with this cover but do, read this series for yourself."
1,WRONG and NOT IN A FUNNY WAY,"Have you lost what I now laughingly refer to your MIND? Anne (spelled with an 'e') Shirley is a skinny freckled 11-year-old with waist-length carrot-colored hair. Even as an adult, she's described as ""slender,"" and ""graceful,"" and ""auburn-haired,"" NEVER (not even once) blonde or even blonde-ish, and her whole character is utterly at odds with this provocative farm-girl soft-porn. This is just disgusting, honestly, not because the pretty thing you've got pictured is a horrible person, but because the grotesque cliche about busty blonde sex-kittens being better box office is something that Anne's decades of friends have always hated, from jump. This is vulgar. Anne is NOT VULGAR."
1,Horrible!!!,"I loved these books as a kid and I read all of them over and over again. I still have the books and the movies/tv shows on VHS.However, this is horrible!!!! There are so many things wrong with that cover that there is really nothing in it that they got right, except for the title.Anne was a red head, not a blond! She wore her hair in braidfs, not long and flowing. SHe wore a dress, not a plaid shirt (especially considering the time the book is set in this is really stupid). She was 11, not 16!! She was awkward, not sultry!!Lastly, the author prefered to be know as L. M. Montgomery because she did not like her first name!!!Whoever published this book should be ashamed of themselves and if anyone buys it with this cover they should be ashamed of themselves too. These are books for young girls, not for teenage boys to drool over."
1,Great story but terrible book cover!,"The stories written by Lucy Maud Montgomery are wonderful. However, looking at this updated book cover is simply SHAMEFUL. It is completely disrespectful to the legacy of the author and the story of Anne Shirley - who has RED hair. Is this what our society has come down to? Great stories that are trivialized because of ""sexy"" covers that sell books. Too bad."
1,Are you KIDDING me?,"The ONLY reason I would buy this edition is to rip off the cover and BURN IT.The books are fantastic, but the new publishers are pissing on Lucy Maud Montgomery's memory by defiling her works with this cover. I will buy every other edition. This day-glo abortion of a cover should never have been selected, but I'm guessing the individual responsible for this at CreateSpace either didn't or can't read the novels."
1,She wanted RAVEN hair!,"Good GODS! If you are going to give her ANOTHER hair color, could you at least have given her the one she wanted? And where are the puffed sleeves?"
1,Eyeroll,"Where is a slate when you need one to crack over an idiot cover artist's head?Wonderful, well known, classic series, done wrong."
1,Horrible cover!! Please give us back our Anne!!!,"Anne is NOT a buxom, come hither BLONDE!!!! She is a red head. READ THE BOOK, AMAZON!!!!!!!! And please, give us our Anne back. Why would you sexualize Anne of Green Gables??? For what????"
1,Way to screw up a classic book!,"Anne of Green Gables is my favorite book of all time, I highly recommend reading it but for God's sake do not by this edition! Anne is not blonde, she is not a cowgirl, and she does not have big boobs! Way to screw up a classic book, anger an entire community of fans, and send L.M. Montgomery spinning in her grave!"
1,Just... No.,"The books are great, but there are other boxed sets out there that present the cover character as she was written. Looks to me like this publisher was seeking to make a quick buck by repackaging a beloved series (which is over 100 years old and therefore no longer protected by copyright) with an image they thought would appeal to the teen-loves-vampire-or-is-it-werewolf set. They evidently did not read the book beforehand, nor did they care whether their cover image actually looked like the character in question. Or was the same age. Or, from the same epoch. So go find one of the other, correctly illustrated boxed sets and leave this one to be remaindered, if only to teach its publisher a lesson in design."
1,No. No. No.,"The cover's been pulled from this Amazon listing, but a customer snap still lets us see the pouty-lipped Daisy Mae some marketing genius thinks is Anne.I can hardly wait for his cover of Heidi."
1,Terrible re-make of the cover,"The series itself is good. Take note this is by a SELF-PUBLISHER! So who knows what other changes they opted to make of this literature. Anne has red hair not blonde. The red hair is integral to the story. She did not wear a plaid shirt and sit on hay, that was not allowed during 1908 for an upstanding young lady. If you are going to buy this series go with an reputable publisher."
1,Really??,"The series is great, but the cover picture is ridiculous! Who is that supposed to be?? Certainly not Anne with an e. Anne begins with a young girl with red hair, and matures into a thoughtful woman with hair she hopes is Auburn. It's more than hair color, it's incorrect and weird. Someone needs to fix the error."
1,Carrots - not Lemons!,"How do you change Anne from a redhead to a blonde and not have to substantially change the whole story? Carrots? Dying it turns it green? Darkens to a ""handsome auburn""...? Whoever the publisher is (based on the cover, it could be Larry Flynt), obviously never read the book!This book is a ""must gift"" to every little girl I know - but I will NOT be purchasing this particular edition! So, so, so wrong!"
1,Just wrong,"Adding my voice to everyone who thinks this is a travesty. Maud would be spinning in her grave. If people are going to take advantage of books in the public domain, at least do it with some respect for the original author."
1,Who approved this cover?!?,"Normally, I really couldn't care less about a book's cover but a blonde? Seriously?!? Did the people who produced this book even read it? Anne of Green Gables is a classic and should be in any serious readers collection. Do your self a favor and pickup another edition though."
1,Seriously?,I'm actually offended by the cover! Anne of Green Gables is a Canadian classic and whomever chose the cover obviously didn't read it. So sad.
1,Who put (cowgirl) RUBY GILLIS on the cover?!,"As other reviewers have noted, Anne of Green Gables is one of the best book series ever.That being said, these publishers messed up and put the WRONG CHARACTER on the cover. The other reviewers seem to have missed that the publishers chose to feature Ruby Gillis, a marginal albeit physically attractive character, on the cover instead of our favorite protagonist. Further, they anachronistically updated her look by putting her in a plaid cowgirl shirt.Now Ruby Gillis is nice and all, but she's not the best role model. After all, she's prone to hysterics, talks about boys too much, and picks up gallivanting consumption. The publishers could have at least chosen Diana Barry if they didn't think a skinny redhead with starry gray/green eyes and freckles on her pretty nose was cover girl material."
2,OMG,"The cover suggests that Green Gables is not a house but a brothel. What next, the Brady Bunch as a Hell's Angels chapter?"
1,"Cover my eyes, please!","I must admit my disappointment at finding out that the Anne in question was neither blonde nor fond of setting on hay bales while wearing plaid shirts. She was skinny, red-haired, freckled, and wore ugly dresses.I was expecting to read about the adventures of a modern teen-age girl working on a farm while balancing the responsibilities of hairdo upkeep and ""I'm gonna be a model someday"" posing practice. Imagine my disappointment when all I got was a pre-teen in the early 19-somethings with an overactive imagination and a penchant for getting into sitcom-worthy scrapes (cue laugh track).Publisher, we need some truth in cover advertising. I can't be the only reader who feels bait-and-switched."
1,What the heck?!,"I grew up reading, and LOVING the Anne of Green Gables books. They are wonderful stories. The cover of this edition is a far cry from what Anne should look like. Why do companies feel the need to sexualize absolutely everything!! This cover is disgusting, and I will NEVER buy this edition for myself or anyone else. Amazon needs to remove this item. Anne has RED HAIR!! She was a lanky, awkward pre-adolescent. Not some curvy blonde looking to get laid. Get rid of this garbage!"
1,So Sad!,"Anne of Green Gables is one of the most well written coming of age series I've ever had the pleasure to read. Even if you don't think of the PBS Anne, with her pretty face and freckles and RED hair...Montgomery describes her as a red head, and her red hair is a huge part of her character, throughout every single book in the Anne series. I will buy these books for my daughters, but NO WAY would I buy this specific set. Why do we have to make Anne ""All American"" looking, when she is not even an American? Why does the photo depict some come hither look? People wonder why our kids are growing up so fast.This is why: Because we hand them a book about a ten year old little girl who is, in the story, awkward and pitiful, but learning to be authentic and only herself, and we paint the cover with a trashy photograph -- what message does that send? Because our girls are hearing it loud and clear."
1,Is Ruby Gillis the main character?,"I hope this is some sort of publishing joke. Last I checked Anne was a redhead, and the story took place over a hundred years ago. Since when did the story have a sexy blonde in a plaid shirt? I enjoy ""modern"" covers to classics as much as the next person, but c'mon publishers... you might want to READ the book you're publishing before going with whatever results from a google search of ""stock photo, Canadian girl."""
2,"Excellent Novels, Horrible Cover Art","I love the Anne of Green Gables series by L.M. Montgomery. The novels are delightful, memorable, smart, vivid, and reading them an experience you'll never forget.That said, this cover is a complete disconnect with the heroine of our story. Anne is frequently referred to as a redhead - ""carrots,"" ""(maybe someday) auburn,"" ""red,"" etc. The cover pictures a blonde girl.Another reason people love to read Anne of Green Gables novels is that Anne is not interested in being the prettiest or most popular girl in the world. Instead, she is set upon living a life that is true to who she wants to become and who she is. This cover does not communicate that character trait, instead portraying a character leaning back, hands in her blonde hair, with a ""come hither"" look and country pop star stylings. Not Anne of Green Gables!!"
1,decidedly red hair,"""She wore a faded brown sailor hat and beneath the hat, extending down her back, were two braids of very thick, decidedly red hair. Her face was small, white and thin, also much freckled; her mouth was large and so were her eyes, which looked green in some lights and moods and gray in others. """
1,Get rid of this cover!!!,"I am totally outraged by this terrible cover of the beloved classic ""Anne of Green Gables"". I have loved this book for 20 years and will continue to love the story and its sequels. What I won't be doing is ordering from Amazon anymore."
1,Classless Cover. Who wants this on their bookshelf?,"One of the most endearing qualities about Anne's classic character is that she would have had way too much class to appear, trollop-style, on the cover of such an f-grade reprint. This has clearly been styled by people who have absolutely no appreciation for literature.Oh, and the red-head issue is indeed integral to the fabric of the text. Anyone who cares at all about, you know, reading, won't buy this horrid failure of an addition."
1,WORST,"Do not buy. Anne Shirley would die if she knew this existed. DIE. She always loathed her red hair, but this is just disgraceful."
1,Blonde? Are you kidding me????,"Thank you for ruining a classic with this God awful cover! This looks like a wanna-be country star's album cover, not a literacy classic!AMAZON- Please remove this atrocity from your website!"
1,Cover is horrible!,The book is wonderful but Anne has red hair and freckles! The cover is horrible and does not represent the authors original intent of the character that many generations have grown to love.
1,Have you ever read the book - this photo does not depict Anne!,What were you thinking?Anne of Green Gables is a clasic book written about a YOUNG RED HAIRED orphan who moves to Prince Edward Island. She is not some 18 yr old looking BLONDE with seductive pose in modern clothing.You may be looking to make a quick buck by spicing up her image but over 200 other people agree that this cover photo is inappropriate.
1,"Amazon, are you reading this?",This cover is all wrong on so many levels. Fix it ASAP! This blonde has nothing to do with the wonderful books.
1,Hideous! How could they put a BLOND on the cover!!??,We should all write to the publisher to protest and get this changed. Anne is one of the most famous redheads in the history of literature. How could they put a blond on the cover!? And what is with the absurd sexy pose?
1,So completely wrong!,"These classic books have been an inspiration to countless girls, and I am looking to replace my long-lost copies sometime soon. But I can promise you I won't be buying THESE editions. Have the cover designer and the production department never actually read the books? This cover in NO WAY represents Anne Shirley and in fact is a direct contradiction of everything that character is and represented. Please pull these and redo them - these covers are a travesty!"
1,"The book is a classic, the cover is insulting","What were the publishers THINKING when they chose this cover for a beloved Canadian childhood classic? Have they even READ the Anne books? How dare you sexualise this young character...and change her hair colour??? Seriously, give your collective heads a shake and withdraw this edition and try again.Not only is this story all over Facebook, it's been on my local news and in the newspaper. Better pay attention publishers, don't mess with the icons!"
1,This cover is an evil misrepresentation,"I feel sorry for the model, she probably has no clue as to what her pictures are being used for, burn every copy"
1,Horrible Cover Art!!!,Seriously??? THE defining feature of Anne of Green Gables is red hair. (Not to mention the fact that she's a child.)The designer of this edition is NOT a kindred spirit.
1,"Terrible, unrepresentative cover","I love the Anne of Green Gables series. But looking at this cover, you would have no idea that Anne is a young, red haired girl living in the 1880s. Instead, you have a sexualized blonde adult woman dressed in modern clothing. Instead of representing a classic character from children's literature, this looks more a cover for an erotic novel. An acquaintance calls it ""40 Shades of Plaid"" and I am inclined to agree. I would never buy this edition of this book for anyone."
1,DO NOT SUPPORT THIS EDITION,"This is incredibly offensive. Nobody read the book in designing this cover. Anne is not a sex symbol; she's 10 years old for goodness sake! And she has RED HAIR, which I could overlook if it wasn't AN ESSENTIAL CHARACTER TRAIT TO THE STORYLINE."
1,Carrots!!,"The publishing industry has hit a new low with this new cover of a classic story. Even if the person in charge of the cover design was a total illiterate, they could (SHOULD) have at least looked back at the previous covers that have come before, over the past 105 years."
1,Who picked this cover and have they read this book????,"I cannot even imagine how this cover was even considered. Has the editor even read ""Anne of Green Gables""? Anne's ginger hair is an important part of her personality and several scenes were written around the color of her hair. Also, ""Anne of Green Gables"" is a period piece about a strong spirited, independent intelligent young lady,(just so you know Mr. or Ms. Editor). This cover evokes the yearnings of a come-hither young woman on a southern horse ranch. Definitely read this series but NOT this edition."
1,"Shame on publisher for ""Sex Kitten Anne""","DO NOT BUY this book. This cover photo just puts more pressure on young girls to be a sex kitten instead of being able to read the story in the spirit it was intended. Anne of Green Gables was about an awkward gangly red-headed freckled orphan for a reason. It was to empower young girls and let them know that they could be enough and then some with their BRAINS, and they would eventually come into their ""swan"".This cover belongs on a slutty romance novel, not a children's classic.This book is as bad as every other type of advertising that makes girls think if they aren't a blond bombshell they aren't good enough. SHAME on this publisher. This book cover is a violation of a classic lesson for young girls. DO NOT support this type of damage to our daughters."
1,The porn-ifyining of EVERYTHING???,"I heard of this new cover from an npr.org report and could not believe it, I had to check it out myself. What on EARTH are they thinking? Not only is the cover model nothing like the Anne of the book...who are they trying to market the book to? middle-aged men? This is just awful. With such poor decisions I can't imagine the publisher can be in business long. I hope Renaissance Classics crashes and burns. They have no sense to be in business."
1,Annie is not blonde - boycott this edition,The picture on the cover is an insult to a wonderful CHILDREN's book. Annie was a small child with red hair and pigtails. Her well-known image should have been used. I think this is a way to not pay royalties to the Annie of Green Gables foundation in Canada.
3,The Cover is a Travesty,"Anne's red hair is a major element of this story. It defines her in many ways. (""People who haven't red hair don't know what trouble is."") When she arrives in PEI she is a young girl with freckles and braided hair.When did she become a sultry blonde?Did anyone involved in the publishing of this book bother to read it?"
1,I hope no one buys this,"I cannot believe the photograph on the cover of this book - I do hope no one buys this edition of this wonderful book. Anne's red hair is an integral part of her, how could anyone have let this appalling gaffe slip through? I hope someone corrects this - and soon."
1,Wow... Just Wow,"CreateSpace should be ashamed of themselves. Sure, books become public domain and therefore any schmo with a computer can publish something but do your research. They just lost my business for any future purchases."
1,An abomination,"If I could give this a negative rating, I would. Anne of Green Gables is a fabulous series of books, but that cover is a disgrace. It completely misses the heart and soul of the story and what made it great. The story is not contemporary, and under no circumstances is the heroine a blond.For those not familiar with the story, it is about a little RED HEADED girl who is very self concious of her red hair, and dreams of it being ""auburn"". She is an awkward, precocious orphan starved for affection who unexpectedly finds a home with an elderly brother and sister. The story takes place around the turn of the century, prior to World War 1. I highly recommend the books, but buy another version, please."
1,Totally judging this (edition of this) book by its cover,"These stories are beautiful, but this cover is simply offensive. Buy other editions of these books from a publisher that has even a little bit of integrity."
1,What a horrible cover,I can't believe you think that changing the cover this way will help sell books. Anne of Green Gables is a classic wonderful book.This cover is offensive to readers of true literature. If we wanted a book with a cover like this there are no end of smutty romances available.
1,Where is the ginger!?,"No reason to ""update"" the cover with a blond model, it is everything this book is NOT about. Please, pull the cover and change to something more appropriate, like a picture that actually looks like the character from the book. Someone at your publishing house may try reading the books before foisting something like this off on the public again. Very unhappy, really hope this is changed!"
1,Disgusted,Disgusted ... Anne is not a blonde. This cover photo is a disgrace. Don't buy this version. Lucy Maud Montgomery would be so disappointed.
1,Get a real copy of Anne of Green Gables,"It is surprising that they didn't drop the e from Anne's name to make a more modern version of ""Ann of Green Gables"". What other changes did they make besides making her a modern, sultry blond teenager instead of a turn-of-the-last-century, gawky red-headed tween. In this one case, do judge a book by the cover - if they can't respect the story, don't give them your money. There are lots of copies over at ebay!"
1,"Wrong, Wrong, Wrong","Wrong hair color, wrong time period, wrong pose. What idiot was hired to do this cover and didn't realize what one of the most iconic characters in all of literature looked like?? One of the greatest pieces of children's literature is being marketed as a YA or New Adult western romance. It's just so wrong, wrong, wrong. Please, no one buy this edition and let us all hope it disappears quickly."
1,BEST BOOKS EVER WITH WORST COVER ART,These books take place in the late 1800s.... I didn't realize that Anne could shop at American Eagle for her clothes as the cover art appears. Lucy Maud Montgomery must be spinning in her grave at this photo - Anne's red hair is often a sub plot to many things that occur in the first novel! I hope whoever approved this photo is fired from their job. Do not buy this edition!!!! Please buy another!
1,Don't buy this edition,"Oh, for pity's sake, did anyone involved in this edition actually read the book? What were they thinking? Please don't purchase this edition...go buy one like this: http://www.amazon.ca/Anne-Green-Gables-L-M-Montgomery/dp/0770422055"
1,Ridiculous cover!,This is a series I LOVED as a child and would love to purchase for my daughter but I absolutely refuse to purchase this version.1. Why would anyone believe that a BLOND young adult in a plaid shirt would be an appropriate depiction of a 10-year-old freckle faced REDhead?2. What part of Anne of Green Gables was sexy?I would give the series a 5 star but because of the ridiculous cover I hate giving it even 1 star.
1,Send a message - DON'T BUY THIS EDITION,"Please send a message to Amazon and the publisher responsible for this edition of Anne of Green Gables by NOT purchasing it. The cover photo is entirely inappropriate for the book. The main character, Anne, is a red-haired child, not a sultry blond teenager. Please protect the integrity of this classic story by purchasing a previous edition from another retailer. Thank-you."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS HORROR!!,"Poor Maud Montgomery!Amazon from all the other comments, you know this is WRONG on so many levels!Get with it and take this down! If you want people to publish with you, then help us to see you are worth our time. This is horrible, Amazon! Get a grip!"
1,"Red-headed, awkward Anne sure has changed!","This cover is ridiculous. Anne was teased because of her RED hair; she was called ""carrots"".Whoever picked this cover is an idiot."
1,Seriously - this is the cover you chose? Insulting,Anne of Green Gables is a classic that should be placed in the hands of every 12 year old - but not with this cover. Pick another version.
1,What was this publisher thinking?!,"What everyone else said. Don't judge a book by its cover. Do judge the publisher. Someone is employed there who does not read, or does not read with comprehension."
1,What fresh hell is that cover?,What is with the blonde? Anne is a red head!!!! It the thing she whines about through out the books!!!!! She gets into a feud with Gilbert because he calls he CARROTS! Stop.
1,Highly Disgusted,"Anne was my hero growing up. She is a witty girl who could never quite manage to stay out of trouble. Aside from the fact that Anne [as many have mentioned already] is a red head, nothing else on the cover of this book would let me know that the book was set in the early 1900's. It is by all means misleading to what the story is about. If I were a young girl today and I saw this, I would believe it was another soppy teen romance. Then I would not have read it. Unless, this is someones sick joke of making the reader look beyond the cover of the book. I truly believe if LM Montgomery where alive to see this she would have fought it as well. Also, as a writer you gave me something to think about. I need to leave a greatly detailed list about how my books are to be represented when I leave this world behind."
1,Don't buy this edition!,"If you haven't read Anne of Green Gables before now, then you simply must buy a copy...but not this one.Anne is a wonderful, red-headed, spunky, dreamer of a character whom generations have grown up with...not this buxom blonde lass from the American mid-West.Please don't support the sexification of an icon of innocence! Buy a version with a skinny, freckled, redhead on the cover!Shame on you, publishing house."
1,NOT THIS EDITION,"Though the price of the set might tempt you, DO NOT BUY THIS EDITION. The marketing team at this publishing house clearly has no respect for you as a reader, for the book itself, and for the incredible cultural legacy of this book series. Anne's gangly pre-teen awkwardness, her anxiety over her ginger hair and her freckles, her yearning to fit into the world around her -- all these elements are swept away in a very unfortunate marketing ploy. I wouldn't give my money to any company that holds its own ""product"" in such low regard and condescends to its own customers."
1,"Hold up, CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform?","Now, this is embarrassing.No stock photography of a redhead available? Publisher doesn't want to pay/credit an artist for creative work?How is it that the copyright for this book is c) Renaissance Classics 2012, as read from the ""look inside"" preview, but Amazon lists CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform (an AMAZON subsidiary) as the Publisher? Que paso?Amazon, get yourselves together! Attention to detail is IMPORTANT.Apply SOME standards to your public domain products please, or all credibility and faith in your brands will be lost!"
1,Where's the sexy doctor Gilbert?!,"If the publisher wanted to market to the Twilight crowd, he should've had a hunky Gilbert holding her! Please oh please remove this book from Amazon. It is so wrong!"
1,Disgusting,"I love Anne of Green Gables. I grew up with this series, and it was a huge part of my childhood.This cover is disgusting. Anne is a red head. Anne is not ""sexy"" and she wears dresses. Whoever did this should be fired. If you're going to buy an Anne book, don't buy this one.Anne of Green Gables the story gets 5 stars. This ""item"" gets one. I'd give zero if I could."
1,Cultural Abuse,"This is a disgraceful ""update"" of a classic that gave pleasure to young children and adults the world over. The cover shows a girl who is totally different from the description in the text. It is as if ""Tom Robinson"" from To Kill a Mockingbird were portrayed on the font cover as a white man!! This is such a violation of the spirit of the book that it should not be purchased!"
1,Worst cover ever,"Fabulous book, every child should read it, but the cover is ridiculously wrong for this set. Would the publishing house do a cover for Goldilocks, with a black haired girl? Or Snow White with blond hair? Red hair isn't incidental for this character, it's part of the story."
1,Recall this edition and republish with accurate depiction of ANNE,"Unbelievable! AMAZON, you need to remove this edition from publication. The cover designer needs to have a slate cracked over his/her head until they come to the realization that ANNE IS A REDHEAD, which is mentioned, oh, at least a few (hundred) times throughout the books. Sickening to see a blonde, seductive, men's-shirt-wearing woman posing as Anne, when she is a redheaded, fiery, orphaned, young girl. Very disappointing and disgusting, AMAZON! A terrible publishing mistake/error."
3,Looks and feels like a text book,"Had not read the description correctly. So I was expecting a 3 volume set of the novel with separate books for each part. It actually comes as a single book. The book is like a school text book, quite large in size. Not something you would expect for a leisurely read. The good thing about it was the price. However I would have gone with the higher priced alternatives."
1,never make your child suffer through this book,"ok, in grammer school and middle I was forced to read this book. then watch the movie and all i have to say was that that was horrible. I couldn't imagine writing about a more unbearably obnoxiuos mouthy little girl, the first two chapters of this book were almost unberable, imagine making your daughter, granddaughter, female reletive read the whole thing. I know, and this book in no ways makes a girl feel better about adolesence, whatever, just try not to make any other poor girl have to suffer through 'anne'"
1,Can't help but note...,"I'm as horrified as everyone else at this cover, but I'd like to note that this version is published by CreateSpace, which proudly declares itself ""an Amazon company"". Take note that Amazon knows nothing about books, and doesn't care about the quality of the material it publishes!!"
1,Sexist Twit!,Who was the idiot who designed this BOOK COVER!!! fire them IMMEDIATELY!!!. A major plot theme is how Anne is sensitive about her red hair and freckles. She begins the story as a ten year old girl. Anne of Green Gables is a lovely coming of age story. Whoever tried to sex it up should be ashamed of themselves. Don't your designers even TRY to have some idea about what the books are about? Buy the books-- but not in this edition.
1,Anne Shirley is NOT a Sexy Teen Blonde,"The book itself...AMAZING! Timeless! A true role model. But buy it from someone else with a different book cover.You take a clean book about a girl who grows into her sexuality at a normal rate, who doesn't dress to entice at age 13, who has character, who shows kindness, who shatters prejudice, who uses her brains, and who rises above her circumstances WITHOUT using her body to get what she wants... and then they use a picture that tells girls, ""But before you read about all that, let me show you first what really matters."" It's another case of ""sex sells"" and it's being peddled to 10 year olds.There's a facebook page called Anne Shirley Is Not Blonde where you can post your opinion about Anne Shirley being portrayed as a sexy, teen blonde. I hope the publishers take note."
1,This book cover is soooo misleading!!,"What gives, Amazon?! I bought this book thinking it would be a great story about the sexy little blonde who likes to wear daisy dukes and pink cowboy boots, living with her daddy on the farm, where she falls in love with the hot stable boy who walks around shirtless and is actually a werewolf. Then I read it and find out it's about a little redheaded orphan in Canada?! Way to disappoint!!"
1,Puffed Sleeves?,"To be fair, I ADORE the Anne of Green Gables books. And if the words are all there, this book is probably fine.But the cover, as others have mentioned, is extremely misleading.*Anne has red hair. This is critical to the story*The story takes place in the late 1800s. While it's not impossible for a character to wear plaid, that was not the style at all. And seriously. Anne wanted PUFFED SLEEVES for pete's sake. What's with the modern farm girl cut?*Anne would almost never wear her hair down (she would start the series as a 10 year old who plaits her hair in braids, and later as a young adult/adult she would wear her hair up in a classy style).*In Anne's era, they didn't have highschool photos (which is what this cover looks like).Also, picture of the blond lady aside, WHAT'S WITH THE LINE DRAWING OF THE DOG/WOLF? I don't even remember there being a canine anywhere in the story. What the what?!!?"
1,ridiculous and offensive,"The story is wonderful, this particular edition with its trash cover absolutely desecrates the story and the heroine. Every child should read this story and spend time in its space of wonder and innocence, for the moment free from the sexed-up hype the cover represents.Get the book for free at Project Gutenberg."
1,What the ..?,"It should be a rule that before publishing something, one must first actually *read* it - then travesties like this Harlequin romance cover with the blonde chick could be avoided."
1,"Great book, horrible cover","As many others have posted, I am absolutely in love with the story, but I really detest the fact that they removed the quirky red-headed young girl and replaced it with a blond model-esque woman that has been aptly described as a ""sexpot."" Also, I'm slightly bothered by the fact that she is wearing modern clothing, despite the story being set in a different time period entirely! I really hope that whoever signed the go-ahead on this cover be fired right away; or at least forced to read the actual book until they understand the meaning that Anne's books hold."
2,What on earth?!? Who OK'd THAT cover?!,"Clearly, the person who approved that cover is completely out of touch and has never read the series. Anne is a redheaded 12-year-old in the first book, not a buxom, blonde hottie of 18.Some people think you will make a story more appealing by sex-ing up the cover. Typical. It's like the book is telling girls that if you look a certain way, you'll be more attractive inside. The books stand alone as quality, entertaining literature. But sex sells, and so I guess that we should sell it to our girls in order to trick them into reading the classics. Good grief! The publisher's marketing department needs some help!"
1,Clearly they didn't read the book.,"She is a redhead. Those that put this collection together never read the book. There is no integrity to this copy. Amazon, please remove this listing."
1,Buy an authorized version,"This is a fabulous book for 8-12 year old girls. I think every child should read the series and I've often bought these books for children when they turn 10.I'm not quite sure what the cover photo of this book is selling, but it is NOT selling Anne of Green Gables (or Anne of the Avonlea or Anne of the Island)"
1,"Great Book/Great Story...Buy it, BUT NOT THIS EDITION!","I couldn't agree more with the comment 'This is Anne of Green Gables.....not Anne DOES Green Gables' ...this book cover is the sorriest excuse I have ever seen used to 'sell' an item...Have we really come to the point that EVERYTHING must have some Playboy centerfold on it, to sell? Come on people...Anne, is a redhead, always has been, always will be...if the girl used for the image really were Anne, Posing like that...Ms. Marilla would have had a fit!! ...Please, for the sanctity of a truly good story...get rid of this cover/edition...Don't ruin this...Please, for those of you reading these comments, buy this book...just not this edition......unbelievable."
1,ANNE HAS RED HAIR!!!,This is ridiculous! Who ever came up with the idea to make Anne look like that has never even read the books. Red hair is part of who she is. This really is an insult to the icon that is Anne. Please pull this cover!Wish I could have given it no stars because that is what it deserves.
1,Quick lesson in creating buyer resistance,"Tampering with a classic, and valued Canadian icon is a sure way to tick off a large portion of your buying market. Changing the beloved redhead to a buxom blonde in a modern shirt shows a marked disrespect for the stories and the people who have loved them for so long.Case of someone not really caring about what they are selling. Just package it and hope the audience is stupid enough not to notice.Will be giving this edition a pass. Not giftworthy."
1,If I could give 0 stars I WOULD!,"Way to ruin a timeless classic! Not to mention wonderful childhood memories with my grandmother. I highly recommend this book series, but NEVER this edition. These covers should all be burned."
1,Time traveling reviewers?,"This was published in November 2012, it has reviews dating back to June 14, 2000? These are mostly positive, possibly as they never saw the book in question? Or, do time traveling reviewers just have no taste?"
1,"Hideous, self published rip off.","Yikes. That's the worst cover art I've ever seen. Buy a real edition of this book, don't give money to this fool."
1,judging book by its cover,"did anyone bother to READ the book?! this is an incredible shame, and insult to the author and legacy of anne shirley. the cover goes against anne's character and image. nope, nope, nope."
