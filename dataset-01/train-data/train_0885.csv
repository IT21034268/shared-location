4,Glad I finally installed these,"These went in easy and I'm glad that I finally installed them after thinking about it for almost a year. I gave 4 starts instead of 5 because the road noise is just a little louder now compared to before. I wish that weren't the case, but overall I'm still glad to have them."
2,Over the top,"The book IS frightening as some reviewers have stated. Many of the acts described in it are feasible but it's hard to imagine a 20 year plan being put into place so effortlessly. All of the terrorist plans work to perfection. There are no moles, no one ever has a change of heart, all of these explosives and weapons are brought into the country, anthrax is created and through all this no one talks to the govt. The reality is that many terrorist plots have been foiled over the last 10 years when someone came forward to report suspicious behavior. The book is exciting enough, but it is marred by the author's constant preaching of his far right wing views. (And no, I am not a liberal) Just OK, wouldn't recommend it."
1,poorly written,"Written from a biased point of view, disjointed story line with side bars of ""facts"" on several crisis over the years. The characters are shallow and uninviting. A Clancy ""wanna be"" of the worst kind."
4,Good read,This book could be used as a terrorist handbook. Thankfully the people who want to do us harm are not this organized and cannot get along with each other enough to make this happen.
4,More to it than theory-speak,"It's true (as other reviewers have complained) that Bennett's analysis can be a little too slick at times. But even if the Foucault-inspired arguments are overstated, this book still offers interesting discussion of specific historical examples. If you take a ""social control"" theory too literally, this sort of analysis will become wrongheaded. But Bennett and other researchers in this vein are asking serious questions: how do the ways we order and represent knowledge (as museums are designed to do) shape what we can know?"
1,Printed in poorest quality after a digital scan of the original book - not worth the money,"This is not a printed book, but just a cheap reprint, apparently made after a digital scan of the original book. Almost all images are heavily pixelated, with incredibly strong ""moir√©e""-effects; sometimes you can hardly recognize what is depicted. Any average photocopy would provide a better quality of the print. The edition looks like - and likely is - a print-on-demand book - but costs twice as much."
2,pop-Foucault,"A glib account of the history of the museum, written in easi-Foucault language which simply adapts the traditional 70s sociological model of 'social control' - museums form part of the bourgeois plot to control the people, along with schools etc. In the end, the account is nothing more than conspiracy theory."
4,German 2-disc version is MUCH BETTER....,"This review is for TheAnnual2002, from Germany. Not only is it very hard to find - its way better than the Garage/Hip-Hop infested, UK version. Disc01 has 7 stellar Dance tracks right from the very start. Stevie Wonder's ""All I Do"" is wonderfully remixed by Cleptomaniacs/Bryan Chambers not only keeps you moving...or in my case - driving, it's still mildly infectious stuff - even by 2012 standards.Disc02 is quite Trancey, starting with iiO's ""Rapture."" Paffendorf's ""Be Cool"" rocks a nice groove. All in all - this Teutonic version is far classier than the UK's trendy penchant for ghetto style. Please give DJ Steve Canueto, for his digital mixing efforts. It's nothing spectacular, like Pete Tong and Tall Paul...but it clearly suffices."
2,Not the best set in the world,"I'd have to say I was a little disappointed in this set. Having bought the 2000 Annual a while back, I expected some better stuff from the Ministry. Disk one is so-so, a few decent tracks. Disc two was what turned me off completely, what with all this cheese techno sounding hip-hop stuff that I couldn't even begin to describe, at least for the first 7 tracks or so. The rest of disc two is at least listenable, last 4 tracks in particular being quite decent. Disc three, sadly, is probably the best, at least it resembles house music. Hopefully they will redeem themselves with Annual 2003."
3,Pretty good,"This CD is slightly dissapointing. When I got this CD I was so excited, I thought there would be all this trance and jungle, but it wasn't. Not even remotly close. Disc one is all this dancy stuff (which isn't bad, I still listen to it in my car). And disc 2 is just horrible. I tried to give the cd the benfit of the doubt, and listened for 4 straight tracks, but i just couldn't handle it anymore, and it's now been banished from being played in my car. If this cd pack only had 2 cd's it would have been much better. All this hip hop, it just doesn't suit me. But disc 3 blows me away. Some songs on there are so amazing. There are some really gret anthems. It's always in my cd player, and blasting. Over all this cd recieves 3 stars. I think that if I had known that it wasn't all trance i wouldn't have bought it. It's a cool cd, but not that cool."
2,Poor!,"This CD is not meant for the American market. This is why Ministry have crammed so many commercial tunes onto this compilation. Ministry are trying to cash in on the huge UK dance music market by using tracks that are well known and have been largely commercialised in charts. The hip-hop that has been mentioned may seem strange to many people. This is because it is not hip-hop; it is UK garage, recently enjoying a boom in the UK music market. All that aside this is still a very poor compilation. The quality of Ministry CDs has gone down hill over the last year or two due to over commercialism of dance music in the UK and Europe."
1,Don't waste your money.,"If you are expecting something like last year's or the Millenium annual editions, don't waste your money. The mixing is poor and the choice of tracks is sad. There isn't even a DJ signing the cover (I guess no one would dare). If you extract only the good tracks of all three CDs, you would probably come out with half of a good CD. CD 1 mixes some of the good 2001 tunes with some tracks of really bad taste. If you program your player to play one out of every four songs you would be ok. CD 2 beging with Hip Hop (Please MoS!!!) and then it gets a little better towards the end, and CD 3 contains the cheesiest trance songs, and ... beleive it or not: Darude's Sandstorm (please, we had enough of it in all of last year's compilations."
4,:),"I must say the Ministry of Sound is just great - always putting in a smoothly blended electic mix of beats. But I think that CD1 is definately the best out of this three cd collection. The dance hits are totally energetic and vibrant. I quite enjoyed the second disc just because I am getting into garage now. Out of the entire three disc set I disliked the third cd the most because it was just TOO trance-y...:) Anyways, good luck! MOS IS GREAT! AYIA NAPA THE CD ROCKS ALSO!"
5,"Ahead of It's time, as usual...","I've had it since the release date, and only now is it finally sinking in that, as usual, MOS has collalesced the state of the art in electronica. That is to say, the best music this genre has to offer, right now.Buy it, live with it, and enjoy what everyone else will be trying to imitate 12 months from now when they finally 'get it'!"
2,Just below average cds...,"I just got my copy today and I have to say, I was really expecting a lot more from all the hype. Disc one is probably the best of them all. Disc two, well, I have to agree with the other review on here. Hip-hop was something I did not want, nor care about when wanting some good house. Disc three has it's moments, but overall, it was just there. I was buying this with hopes it kicked butt, but to no luck. Even though this is my first Annual I have ever puchesed, I hope that the previous ones aren't like this one. Anyone know of some good house music cds? Save the money and find a used one."
3,Wrong Silver,"I have a couple of Bruno Piatelli neck ties, I was not impressed with this purchase. The Silver Color is more like a white.I gave it to a friend who is not as particular as I am, when it comes to accessories."
3,Autoventshade,"These ventshades are quite sufficient. Personally I was a little disappointed because I also have an AVS hood deflector, and although these are slightly thinner than the hood deflector, they are a LOT lighter in color. Without tinted windows it may look funny during the daylight hours. Other than that I am happy with them."
3,Disappointed,Fattburger I know can cook. This album aint nobody put their foot in it! Good but not great colllection of songs.
2,"Love this crib, but need to be VERY tall...........","Just want to let everyone know who can not see this crib in person as I did that it is beautiful, but unless you are VERY VERY tall (I'm 5'5) you will not be able to reach your baby. This crib has stationary sides which is fine, but even at the highest setting it would be nearly impossible to reach your baby. The only possible way for me to get a baby out of that crib would be by using a step-stool, or taking the baby out on either end of the crib which is just impractical. I have the two matching pieces which are beautiful, and really felt bad that I couldn't get the crib, but I knew I would always regret it. I asked the sales people at Babies R Us about this, and they said they get customers questioning them all the time regarding this matter, and that they can't understand why it was built this way."
4,Good Sturdy Crib,I just purchased the whole bergamo set and they are very beautiful. The crib has high quality construction. The reason I am rating this a 4 of 5 is because 1. Hard to put baby in/out of crib if you are shorter than 5'6. 2. No where to tie bumper pads in crib. 3. No place to mount the mobile. really think about these reasons before you purchase.
3,Beautiful but painful,"My husband and I went with the entire set for our daughter's room (crib, changing table, dresser) It is a very beautiful set and i love the fact that i can use this crib for the next several years but for right now it is nothing but a pain. First off Im only 5'2 so it is impossible for me to put my baby down or pick her up from the front without a step stool and the matress is on the highest level. There is no place to tie the bumper pad to in the back. The mobile doesnt fit right onto the crib therefore everytime it goes around it gets caught and sticks for a minute. Also if you have a bed skirt with your bedding set as i do, you cant really see the front of it because it is covered by the bottom peice of wood. The one good thing is that it is very simple to put together. I actually did it all by myself while my husband was at work. It is also very easy to move around the bedroom."
3,"good crib, wood finish chips over time","We purchased this entire set for my son who is now 9 mos old. I have no problems reaching him, and yes, its difficult for a mobile to be attatched. I have noticed that after a few mos the wood finish starts wearing off, leaving it looking scratched and worn out. I am pretty dissapointeed because I planned on passing this down to my next child, im not sure what it will look like when that time comes......"
5,A great introduction to Nat King Cole...plus...,"This CD compilation, while obviously not complete (after all, the Mosaic 18-CD box set covered ONLY his Nat Cole Trio recordings), is still a good introduction to his musical style. While underappreciated as a jazz pianist, he became a household name when he began singing popular songs. This compilation has many of his most-recognized hits, but there is an even more important note about this set. This was released by Capitol after the success of Natalie Cole's ""Unforgettable--With Love"" CD, and if you compare the track lists, both of these have the identical track selection. Back to back, they're a nice listen. Natalie does a nice job on the songs, but Nat King Cole's CD presents the definitive versions of these songs."
5,Wonderful cd,Great for dinner parties / entertaining. Love this cd! Nat has all of his best hits on this cd - recommend for anyone!
5,Bridge To The Beloved,"This long-awaited CD by Diana Rogers is a wonderful addition to the leading edge of world music rooted in eastern and devotional traditions. Accompanied by some of this genre's most renowned musicians, Diana's incredible voice inspires the listening heart to sail with her on the vast seas of The Beloved. A great CD to set on 'repeat' and have move into the soundscape of your acoustic living room."
5,"gorgeously transcendant, Diana's voice will carry you away","I was unprepared for the sheer beauty of this cd. It has a steadying, rhythmic peace and a joyous transcendance that is otherworldly. Rogers unveils the mystery of life and sound and spirit through her exquisitely beautiful voice. The musicians follow suit and will center you with rapturous sound. Unveiled is a spiritual expression par excellent, and a sanctuary that pierces through and illuminates in the midst of the chaos of the world. Thanks to all those who created it."
3,Kasey's voice distracts,"This CD has both strengths and weaknesses: the band is tight and top-flight. The sonics are very good (perhaps the complaints about distortion are due to a bad batch?) and 9 or so songs are quite good. The main negative, to these ears, is Kasey's flat, thin, vibratoless voice. If she were 17, one could hope it would develop over time - being 25, it's unlikely it will improve much more. This is unfortunate, and I found her voice distracting from otherwise very good songs at times. Another weakness are some of the very slow, dirgelike songs - for example, track 11, ""Falling Into You,"" with Kasey and just a guitar, is affected, trite, and unlistenable. The choice of songs are eclectic. Most are winners - however, she should stay clear of the pretentious and nave preaching found on the last `hidden' track. I voted Clinton twice, but even I cringed when I heard her left-wing ramblings on this track."
1,BIGGEST DISSAPOINTMENT THIS YEAR,"I was very excited by the prospect af an exciting new female singer. I based this on high recommendations from a lot of people I respect so I was all the more shocked when I first heard this CD. She has a voice that feels like someone driving nails in my brain. I forced myself to listen to the entire CD and it was torture. The Gram Parsons song ""Still Feelin' Blue"" was the only tolerable track on this CD. I dont get it. I am I getting old or what?? I thought this CD was just plain awful."
1,Overrated.,"I can name at least two songs from this CD that'll make you wonder what's the fuss with Kasey? Two songs that sound very similar in many ways (Am I not Pretty Enough & If I Were You). I don't understand how she can be named as one of the hottest star in Sydney newspaper. She tries too hard to sound like American! Where's her pride as an Australian?I would not be surprised if this CD ends up to be a one hit wonder.BTW, many radio stations in Australia play her songs far too many times. That could be the reason why she's named as one of the hottest star (after Kylie)."
5,Fine and Dandy,"This is the stuff that ought to be getting airplay on so called C & W radio. Alas, that's an old and sad story. Lucky for Kasey Chambers that she hit at a time when the nation's hopeful-hipsters and yawning yuppies had strayed from their Cuban fascination just in time to move to a southern groove. Unless you've missed the abundant push of this stuff over the past year, this CD won't knock you off your feet. Still, it's solid to the core. There are no trinkets wasted to attract the fickle here. She's no Emmylou Harris, but it's her voice (along with solid songwriting) that sets her apart from many among the current crop of so-called ""Roots"" musicians."
5,5 stars- and I'm not even an alt.country fan!,"I picked this up at a record store with little expectations and am just blown away by Kasey's voice and writing. Even though I've never investigated ""alt.country""- Gram Parsons, etc- I have listened to a little Hank Williams Sr with my granddad. If he were still here, I think ""Barricades and Brickwalls"" would be rocking his old pickup all night long. Give it a try- you won't regret it."
4,Not 'The Captain' But Equally Good,"Being a humongous Kasey Chambers fan, I hunkered down the extra coin to get the import version of B & B before it hit the U.S. on a grand scale. Totally worth it, this album will soon be another Kasey Classic. However, I must warn you, I felt this album was a grower, so you too may have to give it a few spins in the CD player before you begin to really appreciate it. If you thought 'The Captain' was great, you will soon think the same of B & B. If you've never listened to Kasey before, I'd recommend buying 'The Captain' first and giving it a listen before you move on to B & B."
5,Essential Listening,"This is simply one of the best CDs I own. I am a huge Lucinda Williams fan and bought this out of curiousity (due to her praise and back-up on one track). Chamber's voice is perfect for the thoughts she expresses, and the lyrics are touching, humourous, and insightful. You won't be disappointed, I still listen to it often even after many months."
4,A country sound...,"...But without the cliche titles and trite lyrics that sometimes accompany country music. This artist is edgy and just a little bit angry-sounding, but without being truly hard. ""Barricades and Brickwalls"" is a must-have for fans of Emmy Lou and Bonnie Raitt. This is an early album, but Kasey Chambers will be one to watch."
3,It may get lonely around here!,"I found the numerical research and discussion very interesting and thought-provoking, but then I'm a statistician / analyst by trade. Where the book earned fewer good marks from my standpoint was Wattenberg's almost giddy praise of immigration. He poo-poos the problems massive illegal immigration is causing in America in favor of the value of getting a bunch of young workers to support us old folk.I found his treatments on why the TFRs have declined and what could happen to be very well developed and written. It was interesting to see some of his perspectives in the light of the economic hindsight we now enjoy."
1,Too basic... even for those of us who are not demographers,"I was expecting a lot from the book, since Amazon has at the top of the list on this topic. However, the book is too basic. I am not a demographer, but I did not find something really deep about the subject. Someone more or less well informed from the press about the topic, will not find any truly additional information. There is also a lot of repetition along the pages."
1,Same old demographic fears,"Depopulation misleading fears have been around for some time. Wattenberg should revisit his calculations and read some good demographic books, like ""Demography and Degeneration: Eugenics and the Declining Birthrate in Twentieth-Century Britain"" by Richard A. Soloway."
2,poor.,"Wattenberg introduces an idea of enormous interest and scope and it was an interesting book to read in sense of topic and debate. However, Wattenberg also dilutes the debate into a one sided ethnocentric account of what is a global problem. He considered himself a liberal but i found his ideas and unneccessary views rather conservative and politically charged. I thought that although linked to politics he presented an extremely bias account, with a pointless degree of patriotism. I was extremely interested in the topic at hand and if written by a well founded neutral writer i trust that this review would be somewhat different unfortunatly it was not the case. I found myself a times, reading things twice out of emense interest but more often than not cringing and at times shocked at how he turned a book focused on world demography into platform to voice his overly oppionated views on almost everything. a low two i'm afraid."
4,"DEMOGRAPHICS ARE ALL POWERFUL, BUT HE MISSES THE ""BIG ONE""","Wattenberg, or anyone else who focuses on the massive role that demographics plays in the future of us all, must be listened to. In a quite literal sense it is ""who we are"". If, as wattenberg says, ""straightforward demographic numbers can engender mighty arguments"", why doesn't he also focus on the first massive demographic impact, now just a few years away - as Arnold points out so vividly in his VERY ""straightforward demographics"" based book The Great Bust Ahead (www.thegreatbustahead.com), we are going to first be visited by the greatest US depression in history starting as early as 2010 and lasting until 2025. Surely this will have a great impact on world demographics that Wattenberg focuses on, that must be taken into account. Massive third world starvation may very well be on the cards if it's as bad as Arnold projects."
2,"Tired, somewhat hacky material w/dated stage presence","Unlike a couple of the other reviews on here, this one won't sound like it was written by an advertising agency. What did they do, copy the back of the CD case?Anyway, the comedy on here is exactly as the title of my review says. He makes the same tired whiny points that comics have been making since the 80's, and with nary a personal spin on it. Not to imply it's stolen. It's just i've heard this all before in some form. Not EVERY single joke is like that...(hence getting two stars), but the vast majotiry is.So, if you want to hear about the differences between men & women, why being married sucks, how yeast infections must have something to do with pastries, and complaints about non-smokers, then go right ahead. For something more original, there is much better stuff out there."
5,You'd think that it would e re-released.......,HEY!!! My review on this movie is that you would think that after this ingeniusly funny and fantastic show has been reviewed in good humor and sought out by thousands of fans that it would be re-released!!! It is obviously appealing to all ages because you very much often read about people who love the film STILL after seeing it when the were 7 and 8 years old in the 80's!! I think that everyone who reads this and who has a website on the labyrinth should join the labyrinth web ring and the save the labyrinth project. Thanks alot!!! Lets get this movie BACK ON TAPE!! OR IN THEATRES!!!! -A LABYRINTH LOVER-
5,this movie desperately needs to be re-released!,"This is a wonderful fantasy about a young girl who's brother has been kidnapped by a goblin king. To rescue him, she has goes to go through a labyrinth and other mischievious adventures. I've seen this movie SO many times since it was released the first time, and it desperately needs to be re-released for the sake of us adoring fans out there!"
1,can't give it any less,"the only people who will enjoy this are Bowie fans I guess and I'm not one of them.The Muppets are funny, this is not. Maybe suitable for a 9 year old who likes fluffy things prancing about but then you have the teletubbies for that....I guess that the only thing that stops me using all the explitives that I should be writing here is the thought that this was meant for children....Maybe that's how it got the 5 star rating - by eliminating the rude reviews..."
1,The Labrinth,"The DVD case came with a corner chiped out, and the CD had some crusty stuff on it that I had to clean off. There was a chip in the DVD and art was faded. None of these conditions were noted on the description of the product. It played well until 5 minutes to the end and it froze. I wouldn't of bought this had I of known of the condition of the case and DVD."
4,Enjoyable fantasy,"This is an enjoyable fantasy, with an over-the-top performance by David Bowie as the Goblin King and a charming youthful heroine played by Jennifer Connelly complementing the imaginative puppeteering of Jim Henson. There's lots of humor, a few scary moments, but generally nothing to cause parents too much anxiety.The genius of Henson has always been to take a medium which is essentially for children and give it enough wit and subtlety to keep adults entertained. Those who look down on this movie as beneath their level of sophistication (you can find a few of them in the lower-starred reviews) have missed the point. This isn't a film with a message or an allegory of life's lessons, it's entertainment.Relax, laugh, admire the creativity of the inimitable Jim Henson and enjoy. It's as simple as that."
2,horrible transfer,"The blu-ray transfer for this film is simply horrible. Story aside, save you money and get the dvd. The picture will have to be better than this. It's frustrating to expect the implied clarity of a bd disc and sit viewing a picture of un-sharp images.Ken"
4,great movie,It is well done and quite surreal. This is a fantastic film for children and adults. David Bowie stole the show as the Goblin King charismatic and musically slope. If you like fantasy or just something different or if you like Glam Rock this is for you. With six songs from rock legend David Bowie Labyrinth is one of the films most wonderful of it or at any time.
5,just plain awesome,"i have love this movie since i was a kid and watched it everyday with my best friend i love the big monster guy and the whole movie i have been searching for years to own it....altho i can rent it, i want it a copy of my own"
3,Not up to its reputation,"Rather disappointing, given the glowing reviews of others. It's far too predictable. It's fun to see Jennifer Connolly before she became a star. Kids liked it, but the grownups didn't."
2,Somewhat dated,"This is pure 1986, as both the dated David Bowie soundtrack and the primitive special effects will reveal. The story line is simple, and there are no scary parts. Good for kids, I guess. I never saw this when it came out. It seems to appeal mostly to people who were growing up in the 80s. If you didn't, you might skip this."
3,Beware of David Bowie's Junk,"The special effects and the sound track are pretty legit. The story is pretty lame as an adult, but it kept me interested as a kid. One thing that haunted me from the childhood viewings was David Bowie's junk. He wears tight pants throughout the movie and his frank and beans are more visible than I liked. It was somewhat disturbing. I also remembered the bog of eternal stench and several other things from the movie. It didn't really hold up past the nostalgia factor. Overall, if you're interested in Bowie's bits, then you should check this out. If you want a good Henson fantasy, go with the Dark Crystal."
3,"Good Movie, but unnecessary scenes hurt it.","This movie has an exceptional plot and memorable characters, but it seems some stuff was added for no real reason. For example, there is some minor cursing (hell & damn). In one scene, Sarah meets Hoggle while he is urinating in a stream. Scenes such as these keep the movie from becoming a classic, which is a real shame because the movie overall is great and these scenes were not needed."
2,"Please, you *shouldn't* have","I got this movie as a gift, as it was recommended from the other movies on my wish list. I was SO disappointed. The plot is lacking in any suspence, the songs have no ""umph"", and the acting was lack-luster. I was expecting something of the quality of ""The Neverending Story"" or ""Flight of the Navigator"", but it seemed merely a movie to showcase Bowie and the muppets. Others seemed to have really liked it, so rent it before buying."
2,Nothing more than an involved puppet show.,"This film was designed for staging an elaborate puppet show. The acting of the two main human actors is wooden, and the plot is shallow at best. The film's interest is harmed because of the slow pace. Fine work by the late Jim Henson, but beyond that, it just doesn't hold the viewer's attention."
1,Fine for kids,"I remember enjoying Labyrinth as a preteen and thinking it had some mystical charm. Watching it again as a 42 year old proved to be the longest, most ludicrous, incoherent waste of 80 minutes I wish I had back. It's just awful."
3,Blu-ray and HD fail to bring Bowie's hair back into style.,"I forgot how scary this movie was. I was not really impressed with the effects. I don't think High def format did much for the movie. It was still pretty awesome, made me feel like a kid again, and my son loves the goblin king."
5,It is Awsome,"This movie is the most fantastic movie ever. Its like being in a dream or fantasy. I have seen this about one-hundred times. I never get tired of it. I would love to have this movie. I'm 16 and female. David Bowie, I have to admit is a Great actor. I hope everyone has or will enjoy it as much as I have. Oh and I have to say I pick this movie on top of any other movie around. This is my fave. all time movie."
5,A Magical Journey!,"You'll love it! It's about a girl who wishes some goblins would take her baby half-brother away so she wouldn't have to babysit him. But when it really happens, the goblin king offers her an oppertunity to try and get to his castle in the center of the labyrinth before the time is up or the baby becomes his. She accepts not realizing that the labyrinth is magical and things aren't always what they seem. She meets some very unusual friends on the way that will for sure make you laugh. David Boweie has written great songs for this movie! Buy it today!"
4,Fantasy!! Fantasy !! Fantasy!!,"I'm just recalling this film. It's really interesting! If you love fantastical world fantasies I also recommend: Catnapped!,Return to OZ and Peter pan!"
4,Excellent fantasy and escapism,The perfect movie for females from 8 to 88. Jim Henson puppets for the kids and David Bowie in Tights for the adults.
5,One of my favorate movies of all time.,"I'm so happy that they are finally rereleasing one of my favorate all time movies. Labyrinth is a movie that I've been looking for for many years, in fact I almost bought it used from a video store for $25. It made me a Bowie fan. This is a movie for all ages, I know this because I love it to death, thank you again for rereleasing it. YOU MOST BUY THIS MOVIE!"
5,A Classic Fairy Story,"This is a magical story about a girl's quest to save her little brother. I think it appeals - or did appeal to so many kids when it was released in 1986 - because so many of us have wished our siblings out of our life.When Sarah's brother is taken away from her she realises her mistake in wishing him gone and will go to great lengths to get him back.The characters are fabulous, David Bowie is a bit of a sex god, and Sarah Connely is the perfect princess. This film will always be a favourite in my collection."
5,"Labyrinth, has to be the most colorfull movie I ever seen.","I absolutly love this movie. It is full of wonderfull characters and an exciteing plot doesn't hirt. I highly recommend this move to anyone, big or small."
5,An Enchanting Movie!,"WOW. I LOVED this movis so much, that I saw it like 7 times in two weeks..IN THE THEATRE! There was such an enchanting quality to this film..even tho it was a little campy. And Yes, Jareth is HOT! I even had the soundtrack for a while. All the songs are awesome, sing-a-long type songs. I recently rented it to show to my son and daughter and they also love it..especially my daughter. Other Movies if you liked this: Legend(Tom Cruise, Mia Sara)"
5,Waa!I want the movie Damn it!,"I LOVE this movie(well lets see ive made two stories,lots of poems and am on both internet lists)I also have the soundtrack but not the movie.I WANT IT,I WANT IT,I WANT IT!!!!!Its not FAIR!"
5,THIS MOVE MUST BE RELEASED ON VIDEO ONCE AGAIN,My daughter first saw this movie when she was five years old. She is now seventeen and has been looking for it for the last three years. I desperatly want to purchase one for her birthday next month. I cannot believe that it is out of production. Why would they do that. It makes absolutely no sense whatsoever.
4,Be careful what you wish for!,"Labyrinth is a visually impressive work that treads very softly on the fine line between children's fantasy and somewhat more mature material. The basic plot of a disinterested older sister wishing her baby brother into oblivion becomes the vehicle for an imaginative journey through a land of elves, dwarves, goblins and assorted other fantasy creatures, all handsomely brought to life by Jim Henson. David Bowie is surprisingly effective and multi-dimensional as the King of the Goblins. This film requires a bit of attention in order to follow the rather complicated search, but still provides an entertaining though not quite relaxing experience. Labyrinth is far from a classic but it does provide a very interesting look at the world of fantasy creatures for enthusiasts of the genre."
2,Like the movie.,"I love the movie. Watched it once and loaned the movie to a friend to watch and when she went to take the DVD out, it broke in the middle leaving it useless. She felt bad and bought me a new one. But makes me wonder how cheap the case was or even the DVD to have it break like that."
5,hide it from the kids.,My kid brother has watched it like religion the dance magic dance chapter. Pretty good movie. Just don't let them bully you into watching it again and again.
1,Loved it back in the 1980's. Somethings are better remembered,"Back around 1989 I probably watched this movie 10000000000 times. In my mind it was the greatest movie ever and had fond memories. Flash forward to this year - I got it for my kids to watch and it did not hold up. My kids found it boring and quite frankly, the movie really wasn't very good. I get the whole nostalgia vibe but the movie made very little sense, the acting was bad, the music was terrible and the effects were laughable. I wish I had not seen it as an adult because it ruined the movie for me."
5,I <3 Bowie,"David Bowie as the Goblin King was truley magical, expessially because of how gorgeous he is and because of his charming wit. the music in the film is fantastic, i highly reccomend buying the soundtrack to this film as well. Jennifer Connoly plays Sara beautifully, and this edition is absolutley wonderful. it is the ultimate item to own for any fan. It also provides a MUCH clearer picture, compared to the original. The picture is much more sharp and looks like the film was made recently and not in the 80s. i would buy this in a second. 100% viewer satisfaction."
5,A Real Classic,"As old as this movie is, kids today still love it. I bought it at the request of a 13 year old and she says it is her favorite. I guess getting it right is timeless."
5,Love it,"Blue ray is amazing! This will always be one of my favorite movies, even withtheir unibrows still intact. David Bowie is amazing."
2,Why so many stars?,"I watched it based on its 5-star ratings.... Not for me, not for most people I know. If you are not a huge Bowie fan, I would think twice about this one."
2,This movie's only redeeming aspect are its sets.,"Everything else about this movie is just bad. David Bowie was a horrible choice to play the bad guy! He can't sing worth beans! His voice sounds like a frog with a flu! And the choice of the actor for the main girl was less than admirable. She did a sub-par job. The sets in this movie had a great fantasy look, and the puppeteering was fabulous! But everything else, including a rather sappy screenplay, detracts from it and leaves it in the dust. Kids will enjoy it, but I'll never waste my time watching it again."
2,Anyone for a slightly used version instead? Where was Sting?,"I thought I would like this movie a lot because of the excellent Jim Henson ""Dark Crystal"" movie that came out before. Like Dark Crystal, the characters were wonderful and better in Labyrinth. Except the bad new is David Bowie ruined the movie. I think Bowie grabbed some old 80's tunes he wrote way back that were so bad they never made it to record. They don't fit into this movie. His acting and music make the film like a horrible music video from the 80's. I couldn't stomach his tunes on this and if the director had any sense he would have cut them all. As far as his acting, anyone in the street would have been as good but he is just fair at best here. I never disliked David Bowie in the past but he damages this movie to make it not worthy to buy and almost not even a rental. They should have picked Sting!"
5,My favorite movie EVER!!,"I fell in love with this movie when I was about five years old, I'm now eighteen, and still love the movie. If you are into fairy tales then this movie is definetely for you. David Bowie does an awesome job playing the Goblin King. I am sooo excited that it has been rereleased. My old copy is worn out."
5,Labyrinth is the BEST!,"I've seen Labyrinth a hundred times, and I never get sick of it. It's an incredibly imaginative film. Jim Hensen did an incredible job (as always). I definitly suggest this movie to any kid, teen, parent, or grandparent. The characters are creative, funny, and original. The sets are incredible and the acting well done. I have the sound track (which I also recommend) and I have the lyrics to ""Magic Dance"" memorized. Buy this movie, and you won't be dissappointed."
5,THE Best of Henson and Bowie,"I have been DYING to find a copy of this movie forever! The puppetry is fantastic, David Bowie is just amazing, and the storyline makes you want ot watch it over and over again. I reccomend it everyone who has any taste in movies whatsoever!"
5,A HIDDEN TREASURE,I saw this movie when I was about 11 and was held capative the whole time watching it. I went out and purchased a high quality tape to record it off of cable. I watched it numerous times until lending it to a friend. His house was robbed with the VCR and none other then my tape in it. Thank god for the release.
5,IF YOU LOVED JIM HENSON SEE THIS MOVIE;),I was very young when this came out I rember watching it.Then about 3 years ago I I saw it again I loved it even more the songs are great and David Bowie in it need I say more.
5,a wonderful movie!,"I have loved this movie since very early child when it first came out in 1986. I spent a small fortune renting it, and finally got my own copy. Unfortunately, that copy was ruined, and I cannot find a new one. Having the Labyrinth out of print is a horrible thing and I think that something really should be done about it to calm the die-hard Labyrinth fans and to start a new generation of them."
5,AN IDEA TO GET IT CIRCULATING,"Okay, this is a bad thing to do. But I think we'd all agree we are desperate. Somebody has a copy of this wonderful movie and can copy it and send it out there. Just a naughty suggestion"
5,I love David Bowie!!!,I never thought that David Bowie was so multi-facited. He is an excellent actor as well as musician. you need to put pressure on the company to re-release the video.
1,Utterly Wretched Beyond Imagination,"This is without a doubt the worst thing to ever molest my eyeballs. The only thing that could make the treacherous expirience worse was seeing that people actually enjoyed it.This movie is easily summarized by three elements; obscenely tight pants, mind-blowingly hideous and disturbing puppetry with obnoxious voice actors, and horrific acting by the only people in the film.I could live the rest of my life in absolute peace knowing that I would never watch this again. I would never put this atrocity in front of a child's eyes as suggested by some (possibly crazed) reviewers. This film is simply not suitable for anyone and if you should ever come across a copy you must destroy it immediately if you have any love for humankind."
1,pedophilia at it's best,"Let's see... she's how old and David Bowie wants to make her his queen? Not only is this one of the ABSOLUTE CREEPIEST movies I've ever scene, it's seriously sick. It continues to appall me how many people just LOVE this film."
1,Laughable Garbage at Its Best,"This movie is atrocious. This may be the worst thing I have seen in my life, and I say that with the utmost sincerity. Hoggle is not the mascot of the 20th century and never will be. This movie manages one star because of its excellent, underappreciated unintentional humor that makes the most of this dark time in David Bowie's life. Jennifer Connelly should have been banished from the world of acting.Anyone who can take this movie seriously needs to get out more. It's just that bad."
1,A really cheesy and corny film,"I first saw this as a kid and back then I knew I bad movie when I saw it. This is definitely a horrid fantasy flick. Jim Henson's creatures are cool, but the story lacks so much and c'mon, David Bowie....."
5,Labyrinth,"Labyrinth is a unique movie. I looked for this movie in so many video stores for years and could not find it. What a surprise to find in on Amazon. I bought this for one of my grown children for Christmas. It was a special surprise, because he loved this movie, very much, as a child. Labyrinth is not only entertaining, but it also teaches a lesson. This is a movie for children and adults alike."
3,Buen recuerdo,Nunca la vi completa esta pelicula y ahora que la compre igual me quede dormido antes del final.
5,Great but should have kissed her!!!!,"This movie was very beautifly done. The characters, the set,and the songs. I thought that it should have won an oscer, or emmy somthing like that because it was sooooo great. But the only thing is the gobblin king(david bowie) should have kissed the girl, oh crap what was her name, anyway because he sang two songs about how he loved her or about love,and he did't kiss her at the end!!! I'm soo mad at that, and even though he was evil he still should hhave KISSED HER.I mean you could clearly see that he loves her torwds the midddle of the end. Its so sad my brother doesn't agree with me. I mean a kiss at the end of a movie is what alwayys makes the movie good. The whole movie its self was amazing, but HE DIDN'T KISS HER. So if you dont mind no kiss or even if you do mind no kiss this is just a great movie to see. Its for parents and children."
3,FOR KIDS ONLY,This movie is for children. Any adult watching this movie neds to seriously be checked out. David Bowie is a good performer but this is below even his standards! KIDS ONLY
2,Not Very Good at All,"This movie was difficult to sit through. The acting is poor, the special effects are dated (it is, after all, an old film), the plot is rambling and even Bowie in his relative youth can't save it. Also, the music is bad-- who would have thought this could be the case with Bowie doing the soundtrack?-- but it's boring. I'm sure that when it was released, it was the cat's meow, but watching it today is difficult, at best. I bought it because so many people rated it so highly, but the joke is on me. I would recommend saving your money and watching something else. There are a whole lot of better alternatives out there now."
3,Fiction,this seemed to me like a mixture of Wizard of Oz and present day lord of the Rings. the Classic Good vs Evil and how a girl is in the center of all this and seems to have an impossible task before her.I think for its time it was pretty great tricks
4,Great.,"It did come used, but none the less it came in pretty good condition for my collection. I wish it would have been marked ""new or used"" when purchasing."
2,for myself,"i know lots of people who love this movie..but i am sorry to say, i am not one of them.effects,etc.are great."
5,One of my top five movies,Ok i was 6 years old when i was first introduced to this movie and i loved it i even remebered the whole thing of dance magic so i loved it my parents spent 100s and 100s of dollars renting it so i watched it over and over and still love it i reccomend it to all people its 5 stars for sure i hope your family enjoys it as much as i do have fun watch this movie its purely magical.
5,Get Lost In The Labyrinth....,"Even if only because this movie has David Bowie in it, it is a must see - it is definitely one of my favourite movies of all times. From the first time I saw it, I could only be thankful that it had brought to the screen images that my imagination had been showing me all my life. And David Bowie. Ahem. Anyway, from the puppetry to the sets, the fantasy is complete. The plot may be a little weak, but it is a fairytale, and generally speaking, fairytales are not required to have strong plotlines, just a good story (which Labyrinth provides). The music is groovy (especially the Fieries. And David Bowie), and the Bog of Eternal Stench is something to threaten young children with (not that I would do such a thing, but it might appeal to certain people)."
4,fun movie,"This movie is great fun. Although Bowie's songs pop up in obscure places, he never fails to tantalize and is the ultimate Goblin King. The thing I like best about the movie, and probably annoys some people, is that the heroine (Sarah) is just a normal teenage girl. She feels like no one understands her, she's melodramatic, she throws tantrums when things don't go her way. In fact one of my favorite lines is when Sarah has said for like the millionth time ""That's not fair!"", Bowie replies, ""You say that so often. I wonder what your basis for comparison is."" Parents with teens will understand. You don't have to love Henson to have fun with this film -- but, if your considering it as an introduction to his work, I'd go with ""The Dark Crystal"" or the ""Muppet Movie"" instead. It's worth a rental, at the very least."
5,This is the one of the best movies I have seen,"This is one of my favorite movies ever made. I am so glad that they re-released it last september. I especially like the little blue worm. ""come inside--meet the mrs."" who couldn't love this movie--it even has several small lessons that everyone should know-- life isnt always fair, and it also shows that even when you mature as sarah does throughout the movie--you still need to return to your childhood and memories every now and then because its part of who you are. actually i can think of a lot more--me and my roomie back in college analyzed this movie once. i have watched this movie at least 100 times, sand still never get sick of it. I must say--a world without Labrynth just wouldnt be quite as awesome. almost as awesome, but not quite."
5,THE MAGIC DANCE STRIKES AGAIN !,"Jim Henson did a great job on this movie. God rest his soul. The first time I saw this it scared me (I was a kid). Ever since I saw this movie a second time I loved it. At one point I tape it off T.V. then I lost it. I haven't been able to find it untill now. I had to buy it. I glad Amazon carried it. David Bowie is a hotty in tights. ""Faint"" He rocks my world. This movie need more than 5 stars. This is a great movie kids and kids at heart. =)"
5,Jim Henson Home Entertainment at it's BEST.,"Great movie, Great songs, And David Bowie is so HOT in this Movie"
4,Labyrinth ~ David Bowie,This is a great movie specially for the kids. It also has a great soundtrack as well and excellent graphics. Also a Must own for any David Bowie Works Collecter. Also not bad for those capturing that era of time and those young at heart. thumbs up.
4,Great fantasy fun movie,"I first saw Labyrinth when I was maybe 6 or 7, and I always remembered it. When I saw it again when I was 15 I realized that I still loved it! I loved David Bowie as Jareth, and his music is genious. This movie is fun for all ages. I even have the soundtrack which is still available to buy. The goblins and humor in the film make it a fantasy classic. I'd also reccommend The Princess Bride and Legend. Labyrinth is definitely one of my all-time favorites!"
5,"He has returned, all pay respect!!!! So speaks the Angel^_^","Oh my God, they heard my prayers, comnplaintsdand demands and it is finally coming back out on video. It is such a kick, I love this movie. It is my favorite of all time. It is not just a kids movie, but every one can enjoy it. Goblins kidnap a fifteen year old girl's baby brother. She has to travel through the Goblin King's Labyrinth inorder to save him or else her brother will be turned into a goblin.Angel of Love"
4,Great For Young Kids,"A silly movie I loved as a kid. I bought the DVD for myself. I put it on ready to enjoy a childhood favorite, and I could sit through it once and only once. Not quite as good as I had remembered, as with many things loved in childhood. My daughter on the other hand loves it, so not a total waste. Since I loved it as a kid and now my daughter loves it, I would say it's a great movie for kids. It's very entertaining for them. As for adults or young adults, unless you loved it as a child, there's not much of a plot but no shortage of cheese. The enjoyment is more sentimental and nostalgic. It's Jim Henson puppets, I mean really, how many serious adults sit around enjoying Sesame Street.No, there's nothing perverse about the movie (as I read in some reviews). And no, you don't have to be on drugs or crazy to enjoy it, just young or young at heart accompanied by a great imagination."
5,Bluray looks good,"The bluray looks amazing and this movie is totally classic. Can you beat the combined forces of George Lucas, David Bowie, and Jim Henson? I think not. Witness Jennifer Connely in her only enjoyable performance."
4,Great Purchase,Great purchase. Big fan of Jim Henson productions since he pioneered puppetry during it's golden era as well as special effects.
5,This movie is a timeless classic.,Throughout the years I have been enthralled with this movie. The creativity in which Jim Henson created this classic is timeless. From the goblins taking Toby to Sarah finding her way through the maze with a little help and Jareth. Who can forget David Bowie? Without him the movie would not be complete. If there ever was a movie that needs to be re released this is the one. People of all ages can watch this movie and enjoy it's special effects and fun characters. Whomever reads this and has the power to bring this movie back please do so for the sake of the child in all of our hearts.
5,I loved this movie. I have it recorded but it isn't the same,This is an excellent movie. Please rerelease it because I have a recorded copy but it isn't the same. It is just about wore out anyway.
5,"Re-release this, Puleasse!!!","Labyrinth is one of the few movies that is worth buying and seeing over and over again. As soon as it is re-released, I'll be there to pay for my personal copy!! If you like a twisted, dark tale combined with Jim Henson's humor, this is THE movie to see!"
5,"Footnote about the ""Making Of..."" featurette","I just wanted to point out to fans of ""Star Trek, The Next Generation"" that there's an interesting surprise in the behind-the-scenes documentary on the DVD. Hint: The Dancing Doctor."
5,Labyrinth is my favorite movie of all time!!!,"The characters and storyline pull you in. David Bowie was perfect! It saddens me to find out that the reason I have not been able to find and purchase this movie is because it is not available. Re-release this classic. After watching Labyrnith agian (30th..no..40th time),about a year ago, we descided to name our baby Pug ""Sir Dydemus."" He was afraid of nothing!! He's lived up to his namesake! Also, it is very frustrating when we rent this movie, and most of the tapes are wearing out and end up being poor quality! The stores can't even re-order to replace the bad tapes. I agree with most of the people who have commented on this insane situation. Most of the kids(some adults)I've talk to have not seen this wonderful story. Mainly because thay can never find it or the stores copies went bad. OK, OK, I'll get off my soapbox after my friend(who also quotes Labyrinth) says, ""Shut up! You shut up!"" -Despretly seeking the Labyrinth, Arizona"
5,The BEST Jim Henson Movie ever!,"I absolutely love this movie. It is my favorite. It has a dash of mystery mixed in with just enough romance to keep the viewer wondering ""What is going to happen--Really?"" I recommend this for all ages who need a break from real life."
4,Edgy Fantasy,"Labyrinth showcases Bowie to perfection--creepy and edgy, the nightmare fantasy warns everyone to be careful what you wish for--you don't know who might be waiting for payment...Henson's formerly unappreciated talent is portrayed to the fullest and he excels with his specially designed characters."
5,THIS IS THE BEST MOVIE OF ALL TIME!!,"If there was only one movie that I was able to own, Labyrinth would be it. When I was a kid I watched this movie over and over and I never once got sick of it. Anyone that I ask about the movie have also said that it is their all time favorite. But my copy of the movie has since grown worn, old and unplayable. I want to be able to share this movie with my children. But now I find out this might not be possible. This movie is so beautiful and imaginative... I just hope someone out there demands justice and gets it rereleased. This movie screams out to all children and adults who love fantasy and have and wonderful imagination, and are yearning to explore it more. It was a sad day when they decided not to make Labyrinth any more."
5,"Not just for kids, teen girls, or romantics","I saw this film in the theater... 4 times. I loved it then, I love it now. My wife is due in Dec. and I would love to have a copy of this Henson Classic for my child to enjoy. I was a high school freshman and movie opened my eyes to the world beyond Star Wars and Star Trek. This is a great movie for everbody who enjoys movies, has a heart, and an imagination... and if you feel like dancing, well, it doesn't hurt either. Oh, btw, the Bog of Eternal Stench rules!!!"
5,This movie is FABULOUS!!!!!!,"The first time I saw it, I just totally fell in love with it!!! Unfortunately my sister taped over my only copy of it!!! I WISH TO BEG:""PLLLLLEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAASSSSSSSSEEEEEE"" re-release this movie, it deprives everyone of one of the late Jim Henson's greatest works!!!"
5,Terrific. Magical.,This movie sends my children and I on a magical journey. I hope that it is re-released so that I can purchase copies for each of us.
5,It was a thoroughly enjoyable and extremely inventive film,"When I was really young, I had to go to the library to rent this, as it was not available anywhere else. Even then, I had to wait an extra week or so to get it, because of its popularity. Everyone I know loves this film and would like to see it again. Please rerelease this film, as it is a magnificient film, both for children and adults. Not only will the person who rereleases it profit a great deal, but he or she will make several people in this world happy."
5,Great Movie,I have the old VHS version of this movie. I have daughters that are 21 and 9 years old. Both absolutely love this movie. My 9 yr old is now into listening to older classic songs by David Bowie because of this movie. She will be 10 in February so I decided the Blu-ray version would be one of her gifts. I just got it Monday and I have to admit that I'm having a hard time not giving it to her now. I can't wait to see it in Blu-ray.
5,childhood movies never die,this was my favorite movie when i was a kid and i haven't seen it for so many years and i bought it and have watched it 4 days in a row
3,More of a kid's flick than a chick flick.,"My actual rating is about 3.5 stars (but amazon is really general so). This isn't a GREAT movie, it was really entertaining when I was 8 or 10 (14 now). Having just watched again the other day, I realized it didn't really have the same effect on me as it did when i was little. The one thing that got me interested in it, in the first place, was the old (very old) comodore 64 video game (comodore is now obsolete). Through the whole movie, the only thing that really keeps the movie going is NOT Jenifer Connely, any fool knows that the real talent is David Bowie, with his sometimes energetic and other time mysterious musical score in the movie. It's really only a kid's movie, oh you may enjoy it a little, but if you're into more mature fantasy movies, rent: Willow, Excailer, Dragonheart, or Lodoss War (anime)."
5,Movie,"The delivery was prompt, and everything was in good condition. Not my favorite movie, but it was a gift for my fiance (it's his favorite!)."
5,Labyrinth,This movie is one of my all time favorites. The best part is definately David Bowies pants.
1,Love movie- HORRIBLE streaming quality!,I have extremely fast Fios Internet connection yet the quality of this movie was awful I will never again rent from AMAZON.
4,I'm lost,"I really liked this movie back in the early 80s. For a 30 year old movie-WOW!! I'm old, just out of high school. This movie still has me Laughing. Even better ion blueray-get it."
2,Sublimely Awful!,"On the positive side the musical numbers are among cinema's most ridiculous, especially David ""Goblin King"" Bowies' warbling. This is the moment when any whiff of cool Bowie had disappears in a puff of fairy dust. Its also rare that a movie achieves a level of awful so profound on so many levels and even rarer that the end result is as entertaining as Labyrinth. Its true I enjoyed watching it for the bucket loads of unintentional comedy that it supplies more than anything else. Actually to the exclusion of anything else. But alas that high level of gawdawful can't possibly be maintained and the movie gradually devolves to what I imagine The Wizard Of Oz would have been like if it was made during a writer's strike. I have to say about half way in I ceased to care. But then I'm far from being a twelve year old girl which appears to be the target audience."
3,"good, but not great children's film","I just recently watched this film again after not seeing it for many many years. I think it is a good film, but not great (atleast not for adults.) The music is sort of catchy, but terribly outdated. David Bowe and Jennifer Conneley are terrific actors. I cannot imagine anyone else playing the parts of Jerad the goblin king and Sarah the lonely teen. I think the humor is pretty poor, but the plot does have some suspense and very good lessons about the dangers of selfishness and narrow mindedness, qualities most common in teens. Jen's character ""Sarah"" changes from being a self centered, know- it- all brat into a compassionate young lady. The goblin puppets are of excellent quality and I think would probably scare a child under 8. I think this film appeals most to the junior high crowd. The making of the labyrinth documentary is fascinating. I loved finding out how the puppets worked."
1,Um...,"It was scratched, and started skipping when i tried to watch it, so you could say that i am definitely very dissappointed :/"
5,CHILLY DOWN!,"This is one of my favorite movies. The songs are very cool, the puppets are realistic, and just... wow.The three best parts of this movie are-1. The Dance Magic song with all the goblins singing2. CHILLY DOWN WITH THE FIRE GANG! Forgive me for using chatspeak, but THE FIRE GANG PWNS j00!3. The battle scene. One of the funniest parts.I love this movie so much. Definately a must-buy."
4,one of the best 'kids' movies,"Jim Henson works his magic!Puppets run the show, from the big guy in the suit, to the one eyed poodle.FUNNY and ENTERTAININGone of my favorites!"
5,Wonderful,This is one of my favorite movies. It is so imaginative. The acting is good. I am a Bowie fan and he was terrific. It's alot of fun - I recommend it highly!
4,"a dramatic, unique film","I remember being a tiny, innocent child and watching this brilliant film. This story is fantastic for any girl to see who's had to take care of a screaming baby. What a wonderful tale! This film takes you to a place where utter ugliness really exists. I don't know what else to say. There are some parts in this film which are so repulsive (such as the farting dungeon) and much more, but it is so great and funny! It is a real place to me, a place which exists within our minds. I simply love it!"
5,My favorite movie ever since I was young - RE-RELEASE!!,"David Bowie is mesmerizing as the goblin king and his songs just serve to add to this amazing, energetic film. Jennifer Connelly is an enchanting and strong heroine. She along with her many Henson-created friends along her journey make this an endearing film for kids of all ages."
4,Labrynth - David Bowie,I love this movie. I've enjoyed it with my children and now am watching it with my grandchildren. I think it's suitable for children over 6 years of age.
5,Magical movie + David Bowie = Timeless Classic,"I first watched this movie when I was about 10, and I was totally blown away. It was in the old VHS format, and I never got tired of seeing it, enjoying it as much as I did the first time. Fast-forward some 15 years, when on a whim I decided to re-watch it just to see whether it would stand the test of time. I'm very happy to say that this is one of those (relatively rare) movies that never gets old!I've seen it many times as an adult, and I like it just as much as I did when I was a fairy-story-obsessed kid. David Bowie's flawless performance as the Goblin King, and Jennifer Connelly's beautiful, headstrong Sarah are the biggest reasons I never get tired of this movie, but Jim Henson's puppets and the magical challenges of the Labyrinth itself is what makes a good story become unforgettable. A must-see!As an aside, I admit I've had a long crush on David Bowie ever since I first watched this movie at age 9 or 10. See it, and you'll see why! :)"
5,Where Nothing is What It Seems!!,"After 710 reviews, I wonder what can be said about this classic tale of imagination and fun.Sarah (Jennifer Connelly) hasa just made a terrible wish, and wished her baby brother would be taken away by goblins, only she figures out the wish comes true. The Goblin King (David Bowie) has whisked the boy off to his castle to be goblinized, and Sarah must rescue him.Between Sarah and the castle stands the LABYRINTH, a magical mesmerizing world of mazes, mystery, and spellbinding excitement, a world where all sorts of tricky things take place, and Sarah enters it.There are so many interesting characters, and it's a film for the entire family. There's music, dancing, and the background and costumes are marvelous. And there's a wonderful ending. Highly recommended!!!"
4,Nice entertaining movie that's not just for kids,"This movie's all right. It's not GREAT or anything, but it's fun to watch on an afternoon when you have nothing else to do. Jennifer Connelly did a very good job as Sarah, although there's something kind of strange about seeing David Bowie singing with goblin puppets and waving his arms around. He's not exactly threatening...But never mind that. This movie is a whole lot of fun no matter what your age, it's not just for kids."
5,One very good movie,This movie is one of the best movies i have ever seen. It shows the limits we use our imagination and how much we can learn. I would watch this movie over and over again.
4,Beautiful and functional,"This fun little bulb is pretty to look at and does what it's supposed to. A couple of things could have been better though. First, as you may be able to see in the picture that another reviewer posted, the white painted-on images are covered with a dingy gray film out of the box. I attempted to wash this off with water, with no luck. So I took a chance and scrubbed it with a kitchen brush, and that did the trick (though it did damage the paint just a tad). Second, the instructions for filling were not quite accurate. I followed the steps exactly as provided but it turned out to be way too much water, because it overflowed onto my counter when the next storm caused the pressure to rise. Despite these small issues, I probably would have given this product five stars...if not for the price. It is, after all, just a thin glass bulb. It's simply not high-quality enough to warrant $20-40."
2,Disappointing,"Based on the other reviews, I was hoping this would actually work. I followed the directions on the box, which do not require any materials other than distilled water and containers to immerse the weather ball in. It appeared to be set up satisfactorily and within a couple of days, a storm came through, and water did travel up the glass tube and as expected, water went back down the tube after the weather improved. However, a day later, for no apparent reason, water shot back up the tube in good weather where it has remained, higher than where it was during the storm. So, I'm not sure what went wrong, but obviously, this weather ball is not reliable."
4,Simple design and works properly,Can barometer predict the weather? Maybe only for big storms.I bought this weatherball as a cool decoration on my desk and noticed the spill-over of water before or during storms. But high-level of water doesn't necessarily mean it's going to rain.
4,The Well Worn Interior,"Although these interiors are probably too worn for American comfort, the style shown gives one ideas to help design an inviting room."
3,Well-worn or Worn out?,"For the most part, I like this book, and many of the interiors shown. However, there are some things that didn't set well with me. I suppose I'm one of those spoiled Americans. I love old houses and the patina of age to a degree, but I don't like peeling wallpaper, upholstered chairs with stuffing and springs exposed, rusty metals, or too much peeling paint. (A bit of peeling paint is fine.) These things make a home looked neglected and unloved. How sad."
4,A nice book about Yorkies,"I never had a Yorkie, but at least I found out all about them, and the pictures are nice, especially the show dogs. The info is also nice."
1,It lasted for about 2 years,"It was great while it worked. In fact, once I set it up I never had to ever touch it again. Everything worked perfectly until the day came when it stopped working. Now, I'm so addicted to seeing the current time and the outside temperature on the ceiling... I'm going to buy another one.I still don't like the fact that it's made in China. I wish I could buy more American-made stuff."
2,Great concept but needs work,"I love the idea behind this device, and I loved it when it worked. But like with some of the other people commenting here on this product, it didn't work completely when I got it - some of the functions simply didn't function - and the outdoor temperature function stopped working completely after a few months. I had no luck with customer service. If they work on reliability and extend the length of their warrantee, this will be a great gift item."
2,Not what I hoped it would be...,"When I purchased this product, I wanted an alarm clock that 1. projected anywhere, 2. was an automatic clock, and 3. was an accurate weather forecaster. This did 1/3 of those things--only the projection. I had issues with getting the correct time because there was a button (which was difficult to push) to change time zones and when the correct time zone was found, the clock spent at least 10 minutes getting the information. Secondly, the weather was EXTREMELY INACCURATE! It came with an additional sensor, so first, I tried putting it by the window, but instead it sensed the temperature that was more less inside my apartment, even if I had changed the settings to outdoor weather or indoor weather. Too bad..."
4,great clock,"Everything about this clock is awesome except that it can be difficult to see the display screen in the daytime. Obviously the projection on the ceiling is barely visible in a bright room, but also, the actual screen is not lit up unless you press a button, and it only stays lit for a few seconds, so if you're across the room, and it's bright, you can't see what time it is unless you get up close to the clock. It would be better if the display screen on the clock would stay lit. Other than that, it is great!"
2,A Little More Quality Please,I bought this unit as a replacement unit for the same model that had served me well for five years but quit working. This unit performed as well as the previous unit until about six months ago when only about 50% of the projected display is able to viewed. It seems that Oregon Scientific is scrimping on the product quality. Not looking for an heirloom product for the price but the average life between the two units is not acceptable. Looking for a similar product with more durabili.ty.
1,WHAT YOU SEE IS NOT ALWAYS WHAT YOU END UP WITH,"WARNING............WARNING.....WARNING........................I bought a weather station here, and it worked fine for 6 months,, then only the inside temperature and clock worked, all other features were gone.I called Oregon Scientific, and they said.....sorry THE service they were using to sync with the weather station i bought went out of business, and now i have only a $100 clock.So any weather stations they sell now DO NOT HAVE THE FULL FUNCTIONS, and since mine is 6 months old......sorry they have anything to replace it with, and won't take it back for another model.IN OTHER BEWARE OF WHAT YOU BUY THAT IS BRANDED ""Oregon Scientific""...YOU MAY BE PAYING A LOT OF MONEY FOR A ""CLOCK"" AND NO WEATHER.I guess i am fortunate that i bought it on Amazon, since they are looking into a refund after verfying the info from........ OREGON UN-SCIENTIFIC"
3,addiction to clock,"The main feature of this clock is that it will project the time and outdoor temperature onto the ceiling (at night) in big bright numbers. If you don't care about this feature, buy a cheaper clock. It is useful if you live in a climate where sudden temperature changes will zap your tender plants and affect what you are going to wear in the morning. The tenths of a degree are nice because they'll let you see quickly which way the temp is going. Note: the projector will quit working sooner or later, and it is very addictive. That's why we had to buy a second one at this ridiculous price."
4,Oregon Scientific BAR338PA ExactSet Projection Clock,"We have been using this product for the last six months... and, of course, it's nice to be able to look up at your ceiling in the dark of the night and realize that it's 3 a.m. ... BUT, as a Minnesotan, it's downright comforting to see that [sometimes all too negative] outside temperature projected on your ceiling. In addition, it's very nice to have an alarm clock that actually checks the time and makes a weather forecast... this is certainly the most entertaining alarm clock we have had... so, why not 5 stars? That little matter of an internal button that had to be re-seated before I could set the timezone gives me some pause about recommending this product without hesitation. Fun product with perhaps some quality control risk."
1,Thermo Sensor fails after 3 months - no replacement,"Thermo sensor failed after 3 months. Went online but was told sensors are not available, spent over an hour trying to find replacment including calling 3 different phone numbers. Now I have projection clock with dashes where temperature should be.The price was good but the product did not hold up."
2,good when it worked.,"This clock was fine- when it worked. It would have been nice to be able to show the inside temp on the projection, or dim the projection without turning it off, but these were minor quirks. The real problem came when the clock completely stopped working after a little more than a year. When you pay this much for a clock, you expect it to last a little longer than a year."
4,Sweet Clock!,"All functioned as promised with one exception - that was soon resolved. I too live in New York City downtown, and had read an earlier review that said the atomic clock radio link couldn't be established. I followed the instructions and left the clock for 72 hrs - but still no Link! I resolved myself to set the clock manually, did so, and went to bed. The next morning, I awoke to find it indicating that it had a successful link! Nice!"
3,Packaging ruins the gift-ability,"I have one of these clocks. It did just crap out after about three years. I loved it though, and once you've had one you don't want to live without it. I've also bought many online and given them as gifts. They were packaged nicely in a glossy board box. I just ordered another from Amazon to replace mine, and it is now packaged in that hard clear plastic shaped to fit the product (which comes out as an odd shaped package) that you can't open without shears. It really cheapens the look of an otherwise kind of cool item. I've given a couple as wedding gifts, they were priced so I could afford them (not as cheap as the 49.95 here, but...) and they could be elegantly wrapped. These are now packaged the same way as a 5.99 Star Wars Action figure. I wonder if the product inside is made more cheaply as well. They didn't last that long anyway, so is that why the lower price?"
1,Buyer Beware,"After a year of use, all displays went out and the clock alarmed continuously. Batteries were replaced and the clock reset. I took the clock back to the local Oregon Scientific retailer and the best they could do for me, after doing what I did at home, was give me a toll-free customer service call number. Needless to say, I have been on hold for nearly thirty minutes now, as I share my frustration with Oregon Scientific's product and customer service."
5,ITS THE BEST BED SIDE CLOCK EVER !!!,The projection is awesome! The alarm starts quiet then gets loud enough to wake anyone (except the dead or the laziest). The weather forcasting works great never wrong. Knowing the time and outdoor temp as soon you open your eye's right on the ceiling or wall is wonderful! Never needs to be set I receive the signal fine and I live in northern rural Minnesota. Buy it you will love it.
1,NOT Good... has some problems,"GoodWhat I like is laser projection. It is in big letters and you could swivel it 180 degrees so you could position projection on a ceiling or wall. You could also zoom projection and flip it upside down. Very useful.Bad1. I bough this unit with intension to use outside termometer inside the house in another room. However, I do not think that both termometers inside the unit and outside one showing temperature correctly. They both show few degrees more than my other simple termometers.2. It is been more than 4 days and unit still did not established radio connection to sync with atomic clock.3. In the dark the only possible way to see time is projection on the wall or ceiling. However, would be nice if clock itself had a red display so would function as both projection and regular clockMinor1. Buttons on a unit too small(I do not think you r not going to use it after you finish initial setup)2. Snooze button is way too small..."
5,Good Buy,I bought the clock for my husband's birthday and he loves it - not sure I'm crazy about numbers on the ceiling but he is delighted with all the features this clock has. It came quickly and in perfect condition.
3,one annoying snag,You need a really small screwdriver to allow you to acess the socket to attach the power supply. Since I don't have one I have been unable to utilise this feature.
3,BATTERIES,"I have terrible vision (near sighted -4.75 contacts)and always had to reach for my glasses at night to see what time it was. You can adjust the arm of this clock to make the display as big as you need it. No need to reach for glasses anymore. The cons to this clock are that there is no radio, just the increasing beep (which we've gotten used to). I'm very disappointed that even though it plugs in, the clock runs on BATTERIES. The plug is only for the projection (which I didn't notice in the reviews until after we bought it). Overall, the clock is fine, but I'll still need to hold on to the old one as a back up. Wouldn't want to be late for work :-)"
5,All I expected,"I have wanted something like this since I saw Tom Cruise (Mr. Cool) use it in a movie over a decade ago.For someone losing their close-up vision and interested in the outside temperature, you've found one cool gadget.Some complain about using a battery.... big deal. You plug in the power cord and the projection works like a dream which can be adjusted and focused about anywhere in the room. We DEFINITELY recommend! Enjoy"
1,3 Month Warranty -- for a reason!,"Purchased clock at Christmas. Projection didn't work -- after much time on phone waiting to speak to someone, they exchanged clock -- cumbersome return process -- but in about a month got a new clock. Now eight months later the projection stopped so I called Oregon Scientific to learn how to replace bulb or? Answer was the ""warranty is three months and we can't tell you how to change the bulb?"" Obviously I was amazed and asked how I could then return the clock to working order and was basically told that I was out of luck. Clock is a nice idea -- perhaps someday, someone will build a quality one!"
3,needs both battery and AC power,The clock requires batteries and the projection clock requires AC power -- why the clock can't be powered by the AC power is a mystery. Some of the buttons could have been better placed if you are using this as an alarm clock. Mine simply stopped working after 6 months and the manuafacturer warranty is 60 days. I wouldn't buy one of these again.
1,"doesn't work, no customer service","I got one of these for Christmas last year. It worked for about a week and then lost the ability to communicate with the temperature sensing remote. Tried everything in the manual and web site to get it going again, have emailed customer service a half dozen times with no response at all. It was great while it lasted, but the complete absence of customer support scores a big fat zero in my book."
3,Could be better,"I love the idea of a projection clock and thought this one was the best. I hated the packaging as someone else mentioned. Makes it seem very cheap. I wish it were lit up all the time (background). I think it's crazy that you have to use ac power for the light AND batteries for the clock. Otherwise, I do love the clock. Just a few ""imprefections""..."
4,"Cool, but.....","I've had this projection clock for a couple of months, and for the most part, I love it. I don't use alarms, etc., but I do agree that the buttons on it are difficult to access. My issue is that the temperature is carried to a tenth of a degree. I bought this clock because I want to barely wake up, glance at the ceiling, and fall back asleep. With the temperature carried to three places, at least in Wisconsin at this time of year, there are many times where I have to think to figure out which is the time and which is the temperature. My brain can do it, but the whole purpose of this clock for me is to not turn my brain on to thinking mode. I don't need to know the temperature to the decimal point - 48.6 degrees doesn't mean much more to me than 48 or 49. I contacted Oregon Scientific to see if they had a projection clock that just had the simple temperature. They don't. To me, this is a design flaw. Otherwise, it's great."
3,Rewrite Manual to include Cleaning the Remote,After three years the remote temperature component stopped functioning. My husband ended up cleaning the remote with alcohol spray and it works properly now. What a relief.The users manual ought to address this issue so customers can make repairs.
2,Not what expected,"Looking at this device on the picture, I thought it'll have the graphics (i.e. clouds, etc like shown) but it is plain boring, only shows date/time and in/out temperature. I had to reset it 3 times in order to finally properly project the time AND temperature (it didn't at first). All in all, for the price, it could have been better."
3,Vampire clock,Great at night when you can see the time and outside temperature displayed on the ceiling. Almost impossible to see during the day or when the lights are on. You have to press the snooze bar to make the time/temp viewable.
2,WORKS GREAT.... SHORT LIFE SPAN,"Aside from a few quirks(display does not stay on very long and buttons are small and difficult to use)I found this clock to be a pleasure to own. My wife and I enjoy the projected soft red display on our bedroom ceiling and the convenience of being able to know the time and temp. at a glance. The down side is the quality / life span of the unit itself. As admitted, we do enjoy the clock, however we have replaced it twice after it eventually quit displaying any information on the clock or it's projection. Although Oregon Scientific makes a fair product, they missed the ball on this one. For the record, we replaced both clocks in a four year period. The second one burnt out over Christmas 2009 after owning it for one year. I will not replace this unit with the same one but a atomic projection clock is a very useful and informative instrument. I'll report back as to the new one I purchase."
2,Just Okay,"I had an Oregon Scientific clock for 10 years so when it needed replacing, I ordered another one that was similar but it was supposed to be a better model. The temperature on the sending unit is 6-8 degrees off all the time. The company has been great about support, but we couldn't get it working properly. They are taking it back and sending a new one (the manufacturer, not the seller. I never contacted the seller) I'm hoping when the new one arrives, it will be accurate. If so, I will rewrite my review."
5,Projetion Clock,"This is a great product, it is the second I have purchase, the first one I purchase in Brookstone less than a year ago, and unfortunately they deny the warranty, even though it was not expire yet, and even worst, the problem was with the transmitter, and they never return the clock to me, bunch of crooks those Brookstone guys.Anyway, if you are looking for something like this don't buy at Brookstone, buy it at Amazon, this will save you U$ 30.00."
4,GREAT FOR ME,"Well I use my cell phone for my alarm clock but my eye sight has been bad now that I'm in my fortys, that I struggled to see the time, so that kept me from falling back to sleep. But with the projecter I can see the time perfectly that I can fall back to sleep. It also projects outside temp but not the inside, the weather seems to be somewhat accurate and the backlight only stays on for a five seconds. I hope it lasts me a long time because I like that it is compact that I can take it anywhere."
4,Projection clock,This was a great projection clock that lasted me about 4 years and then just died on me. I would buy another if I could. I have owned a couple other different brands in the past and this one was superior.
1,Do not buy,"Such a great clock if only it worked! I never got it to set to the atomic clock so I had to manually set it, it never picked up the correct temperature, and the projection died less than two months in. Too expensive for such a failure."
2,Fix it and it would be great!,"It may not matter any more since it is no longer available anywhere, it seems, but the first one I ordered from O S years ago is still working fine. Then I decided to get one for my son and had to hunt it down here on Amazon. The features are just what I wanted and expected so no problem there. This new unit just would not coordinate the projected time with the clock time and if we followed the instructions to force the match by pushing the snooze button it reset the projection to 12:00 every time. Everything else worked fine including the outdoor temp and weather prediction features so we assume that it is another in a long line of manufacturing glitches that this product seemed to be plagued with. Too bad. When it works it works well. Thankful for Amazon's return policy. Not too impressed with O S customer service or product responsibility."
4,Love it!,"Love waking up each morning with the time and temperature on our bedroom ceiling. Had a previous one (different type) that had problems, so we ordered a new one because we missed it so much. Once you start with it you're hooked. Enjoy!"
5,Great projection clock!,"I bought this for Christmas and we just love it! It's not too bright to awaken you or keep you alert, but, is so handy during the night or early morning to check outside temperatures and the correct time! We have frequent overnight storms here and it helps us keep watch so we're not late in the mornings. Highly recommend this one...easy to read, brightness is just right and accurate Atomic clock feature is wonderful. I like it so much I bought a second one to use."
5,Great Clock - Great Value,Fast delivery - great product.Works exactly as described on the Website and provides a very easy to read display. Can be placed virtually anywhere in the room and can be adjusted for perfect viewing. The only thing that I could think of as a complaint would be that it seems to need to be placed next to a window to synch up the time with the national time source. But that isn't the fault of the product.
2,Won't work in Alaska/Maybe Hawaii too,"I ordered this for a Christmas present last year. The projection of outside temp is great, however it will not automatically adjust to time in Alaska (and possible Hawaii as well). I called customer service, they said it was because we were too close to the ""pole."" I'm bummed that it displays always 1 hour ahead of our actual time, and cannot be manually overridden. (although customer service says it can, it will not work for us. The clock always readjusts to 1 hour ahead.) Do not order this if knowing the actual time is important to you and you live up in AK. Of course, the temp./weather feature is nice. All in all, I'm disappointed and wish they would either replace my clock with one that will work up north, or else reimbursement since it was falsely advertised."
5,love this clock,"I recently purchased this clock for our bedroom and it has been one of my favorites purchases. I can read the clock during the day and night with no problem and the atomic clock set up within 2 minutes, it was so easy. I also like having the temputure show up. I would recommend this to everyone looking for a projection clock."
4,One out of three ordered did not work.,We ordered 3 for family at Christmas and one of them did not work but Amazon was very helpful in getting the return and the re-order handled.
5,The best projection clock,"This thing is GREAT!!! I wear glasses (nearsighted) during the night if I wake I can look up at the ceiling above the bed and read the time without my glasses. I can't believe I ever went without it, I gave one to my mother for Christmas, she loves it too."
4,Very accurate,"Very accurate, the only problem is that the blue indigo light does not stay on. It only comes on for a few seconds when you press a button on top of the unit, then goes off again."
1,It arrived broken,"It arrived and did not work. I called Oregon Scientific, they said they would replace it, if I faxed them the receipt. I did that and have heard nothing. I waited 1 1/2 hours on their customer service line and got disconnected. Hmmmmm!"
1,Be careful with Oregon Scientific products,As with most Oregon Scientific products this unit is cheaply built and horribly unpredictable. I have now tried three different OS products from weather analyzers to atomic clocks and not one of them has worked as advertised. Stay away if you are looking for something that will last.
1,Worst Projection Alarm Clock,"I would NOT recommend this clock. The cord is too short and it only works on the right side of our bed. You also can't turn it far enough to project where you want it to. Also, I could care less about the outside temperature feature (which doesn't work)...that display's for far to long vs. the clock."
1,TOTAL MESS,Frustrating!! I live in New York City and I cant get the signal to have the clock set itself. As for the weather forcasts and temperature? THEY ARE ALWAYS WRONG!! Save your money. This thing is garbage. OH! and the alarm? you better be a light sleeper cause a snail makes more noise then this thing.
2,Will Quit,I bought one of these clocks for myself and three for other friends and after about a year it goes to a straight line for outside temp. Needs ac adapter for the clock and backlight needs to be illuminated all the time if you want. The inside temp is wrong. It seems to work well otherwise.Henry
4,Love the projection feature,"I bought this clock for my husband for Christmas. Setup didn't take very long (once he decided to read the directions), and the signal was on in a few hours. We both love the projection feature, as we both wear glasses and can't see a regular clock at night. The weather is fairly accurate. The only drawback so far is that there isn't a dual alarm."
5,Great Product,My wife & I love this product. I'm blind as a bat and I can read it on the ceiling at night. I'd recommend this product to anyone.
4,Attractive Product,"This is a very handsome little package. It projects time and date on ceiling and is pretty cute.My problem with it was I was looking for a hygrometer, humidity and time. It would make a very nice ggift to someone."
2,"Good product, but not if you're looking for an Alarm Clock!","I purchased this as a Christmas gift for my dad. I loved the idea of time/temp projection. The problem I had with this clock is the alarm. The alarm is a series of beeps ranging from one beep to multiple beeps. There is no volume control for the beeping, and the beep is not very loud. It is hard to believe that the alarm would wake up anyone. I don't recommend this product for anyone looking for an alarm clock."
1,Doesn't work in the Northeast,"I purchased this clock for my husband for Christmas and am so very disappointed. We lose power frequently so I thought the self setting feature would be terrific. You must be within 932 miles of Boulder CO for the atomic clock portion to work. If you want an atomic clock and you are in the northeast, look elsewhere."
3,3 out of 4 ain't bad,"Purchased four of these for Christmas gifts. Three of them worked perfectly (and the recipients were very happy). The fourth had a problem with the power supply. The clock worked well on batteries but the projection portion would not work because the AC power adapter had a problem. Did a little bit of diagnosing and determined that the power brick was OK and was putting out the appropriate voltage so it must have been the power connector on the clock itself. Anyway, ended up returning the fourth unit to Amazon but they said they couldn't replace it and had to credit my account. I'll be picking up a similar item elsewhere."
4,Oregon Scientific BAR338PA Projection Clock Review,The clock was easy to set up and worked well from the get go. The only negative I have is a minor one--the style of the numbers projected onto our ceiling makes them a little difficult to read at a glance.
4,projection Clock,"I have several of these clocks, and really like them. Over the years, the only problem I've ever had is that the LCD display quit on one of them. The clock was still under warranty, and Oregon Scientific replaced it without hassle. Almost everyone who sees it wants it, and most of them actually get one!"
3,Battery Eater,This clock functions well as a clock and temperature indicator but it eats AA batteries by the handful. You will find that you will be replacing the 4 - AA batteries at least every thirty days. the powerpak only operates the wall/ceiling projector not the clock. The other problem is if you have other Oregon Scientific temperature indicators it will sometimes display those sensors instead of the outdoor temperature sensor that came with the clock
4,Pretty Good,Heard from people about the buzzing which it does but we never really use the backlight. Displays really nice. We are very happy with it
4,"Works well, temperature only OK.","Have had for 6 months, no need to replace the battery. Outside temperature reads a little high, I would guess 5-8 degrees warmer than actual temperature (thus 4 stars instead of 5). You have to actually read the manual, operation is not all that intuitive (or at least not to me).I see very, very poorly without glasses and I can read this at night rather easily without difficulty. Actual clock not to easy for bifocaled person to read from across the room. I bought it for the ceiling display and that job it does rather well. Also resets itself when the power blinks which is convenient as well since we have a lot of that in Florida during the thunderstorm season. I would buy again"
2,Never displayed the proper temperature,"Even though the display showed I had an ""adequate"" reception signal the outside temperature displayed was always off by an average of at least 20. (yes I had the correct time zone) The time and date were always correct and the projection onto most surfaces was very good!"
5,Very please with this unit!!!,I had a previous model by another manufacture that has been discontinued. This model works as good or better so far as my former model.Very good projection on the ceiling and within 2 degrees of my other thermometers. Over all I am very pleased with this unit. Time will tell about how well it is made and if it continues to be accurate . As of this time I will have to rate 5 stars because it performs as advertised!
2,Build a reliable cloack and they will come,My wife and I loved this clock. We bought two for our family and one for our parents. The first one died(straight line output) after about a year and one-half. The second one died less than a year. The projection of the time and display of outdoor temperature while laying in bed is great. We really miss it. Agree with other reviewers that the clock should be able to run continuously on AC power with blue light background. Note to entrepreneur: build a more reliable clock with suggested features and they will come.
3,"Great features, short lifespan","As far as looks and feature list go, this is my clear favorite out of all of the projection clocks I've seen. However, they have short lifespans. My first one died after only two and a half years. I read the manual, and saw that was its life expectancy for continuous use (and, of course, clocks are going to be continuously on). VERY unsatisfying for such an expensive clock!!"
2,"Good, but 58 dollars?!?!?!?!? crazy","Its a good book, but for 58 dollars u can get better stuff. It is a very simple compendium about the basic elements of international law.Update: The auctor died (2005) so don't expect a vol.2."
5,"Golden Vocals, Golden Piano",Nancy Wilson sings only half of the tracks backed by the Shearing combo. The other tracks are intrumentals by Shearing. Fine biscuit.
3,3rd rate Jazz,"Look, I'm sorry to disagree with 7even other people who luv this, but I couldn't bring myself to give it more than 3/5. It was a good idea, a soul-singer with a jazz quartet. But really, Nancy's put on Jazz voice is nasal and annoying. especially My gentleman friend and Let's love again. Also, the instrumentals, except Track 12, inspiration, are slow and very un-Shearing. His usually bright, cheery and well paced. But most of this material is boring, slow and uninspirational. Sorry to be of such a different opinion. I know there's nothin worse than someone rubbishing yer favourite recordings. It's awful. It's just to me it soudns like third rate Jazz."
2,Not at all what the title led us to think,"The movie was okay...but not one I would want to own and watch over and over again. Not really ANYTHING to do with missionaries, as the title lead you to believe."
4,Return with Honor is honorable,After purchasing some somewhat mediocre videos I was hesitant to purchase this one but my whole family really liked it. It shares a wonderful message of the power & necessity of unconditional love.
2,lds movies,This was great in some parts... other parts were just sooo corny. At the end when the guy is singing into the phone... my teenage boys were throwing couch pillows at the TV. Yelling get off the screen! Yea... it was a eye roller. 2 out of 5
2,Leading Ladies - list of movies,"I searched the internet without any success trying to find the movies on this DVD set before I bought it. I gave up searching and bought it anyway. I thought for the $12 I paid for 17 movies I couldn't go wrong. The jury is still out (that's why only 2 stars). If you are a Ginger Rogers fan you'll be disappointed with the selection. Anyway, this is not a review - just a list of the movies in case you are thinking of purchasing.Volume 1 - Maureen O'Hara- Jamaica Inn 1939- Kangaroo 1952- The Deadly Companions 1961Volume 2 - Barbara Stanwyck- Strange Love of Martha Ivers 1946- Lady of Burlesque 1943- Meet John Doe 1941Volume 3 - Ava Gardner- Ghosts on the Loose 1943- Snows of Kilimanjaro 1952- Whistle Stop 1946Volume 4 - Helen Hayes- Stage Door Canteen 1943- A Farewell to Arms 1932Volume 5 - Elizabeth Taylor- Divorce His 1972- Divorce Hers 1972- Last Time I Saw Paris 1954Volume 6 - Ginger Rogers- The Groom Wore Spurs 1951- The Thirteenth Guest 1932- Heartbeat 1946"
1,Blue dye everywhere...Don't waste your money!!!,"My daughter has wanted this hair streaker for 2 years, she got this as a Christmas gift and it was a BIG disappointment!The hair wand is very cheap it is hard to open and close,you have to squeeze the goopy hair dye from the tube onto a TINY sponge in the wand.Don't put too much on because then it gets all over the wand.The dye does not dry we had blue dye everywhere...It was all over her clothing,face and hands,carpet and it does not come out!!!Don't waste your money, this is a poor design!"
5,Perfect in every sense.,I love Jazz. I love Danny Gatton.This is the Danny Gatton album every Jazz enthusiast should own. This one and Relentless by Danny and Joey De Francesco. This one is perfect Jazz in every sense. A stellar obscure and forgotten recording.Oh Danny boy !!!!!!! What a nocaster player!
5,An Alltime Classic,"This album is nothing short of spectacular. It is, without a doubt, a ""desert island"" CD. Gatton plays on another level and elevates this record to astonishing heights."
4,Great players and a solid effort.,If you want a Danny Gatton Cd with backing musicians you will be let down.If you want to hear Gatton play with musicians on his level and create great jazz this for you.The three star reviewers are clueless.
3,It is a pity that Jerry Lewis got a hold of this,"I first saw this on stage in the late 1960s, with Leonard Nimoy (!) as the alien visitor. It is a wonderfully funny story, really kind of a frolic when compared to the heavier historical novels of Vidal, and yet it spoofs the Washington elite in a typically tart vidalian fashion: you see generals portrayed as macho buffoons, which was quite shocking for the pre-Vietnam protest era. The story is basically that of the immature alien coming to capriciously exercise power on a more primitive earth. Vidal admits that he wrote it to make money in Palimpsest, but it is quite fun. If Jerry Lewis had not bought the rights to this and made an awful film version, it might have been done much much better as satirical scifi.Recommended."
2,Dated once (but no longer) potent satire,"Gore Vidal's satire on 1950s militarism and presumptive American superiority is pretty dated. It still has things to say that are worth attention, but it's hard to imagine a modern-day staging of this play that wouldn't require some serious reframing. The story of an alien from space named Kreton who seems to be less a cretin than the earthlings he visits, the play has little of the spectacular verve of language associated with its writer, one of the great wordsmiths of his time. As a play it's somewhat more serious than the film version, which was restructured as a Jerry Lewis vehicle. But not by much. After years of things like 3rd Rock from the Sun, it's hard to imagine a modern audience finding the wide-eyed gullible alien here much of a comedic revelation. I wonder what Vidal thinks of it now, fifty years after he wrote it. Not much, I bet."
5,Easy peasy,Very easy to set up. Came with printed simple-to-follow instructions. Had it set up and working in under half a minute.
4,Did I Say the World was Fair?,"""I"" is certainly removed from the poppy ABBA styled synth-bliss of my favorite Magnetic fields Album,""Holiday,"" but these beautifully crafted queer-love songs are worthy of recognition. If you enjoy Merritt's tragicomic rendering of ""If I were a Rich Man"" (MP3 available on Amazon) or the stylistic banters and lamentable crooning of similar artists, ie. Morrissey, you'll find an abundance of satisfying material on ""I.""Honesty and artfulness are forever worth more to me than pop hits."
4,very clever,"Stephin Merritt is perhaps the most brilliant songwriter alive today.While 69 Love Songs affirms this without question, i is a very charming and brilliant album.The world is a better place with this music in it and I hope Stephin and co. keep up the good work."
2,The most pretentious release of 2004,The weakest Magnetic Fields albumThe most pretentious Magnetic Fields albumThe weakest melodies on a MF albumThe worst lyrics on a MF albumThe most boring MF albumI wish it was 1999 again and I was listening to 69 Love Songs for the first time. This album sounds like bad outtakes from that album. This album should have never been released.
3,"Disappointing, except for one exceptional song","The book of love is full of music. In fact that's where music comes from. Some of it is transcendental, some of it is just really dumb.Most of this borders on the dumb side.Like anyone who's heard it, I loved 69 Love Songs. I loved ""The Charm of the Highway Strip"" as well.This album, for the most part, sounds a bit too much like other songs Stephin and Co. have already done. He's sort of beat the ""Acoustic Guitar,"" ""My Little Ukulele"" ""I'm an Operetta"" thing to death.But... there is one song on this album that is transcendental. ""I Thought You Wer My Boyfriend"" is worth the $15 you'll pay for this. I'm not an advocate of buying an album for just one song, except in this case where the song is SO good, it's worth it. The melody is great, the hook is phenomenal, the phrasing is just astounding, and the lyrics are engaging. Put 'em together, and it could be Stephin's greatest song ever."
5,"Chris really sings from his heart in this one, best yet.","I have always been a Chris fan but this has to be the best yet. I love the songs that sound like they come from the heart, in this cd they all do and they all have a secret meaning in them wich make them injoyable to listen to."
2,Voices?,"Voices of Jamaica offered entertainment from three great reggae artists. It is like being at the concert in the comfort of your own home. However, the concert wasn't any fancy production, more low budget. The DVD?...I only wish the sound quality and picture quality was better. The sound was far from crisp and clear. The video was probably not recorded with any hi-tech equipment because it had the quality of television 25 years ago. But, if you are a true reggae fan, it would not matter."
5,GREAT CAMERA,"THIS CAMERA TAKES GREAT PICTURES. YOU HAVE THE EASE OF A FLOPPY DISK. YOU CAN PUT UP TO THIRTY PICTURES ON THIS DISK DEPENDING UPON THE FORMAT YOU USE. ALSO, THE DISK ARE CHEAP, UNLIKE MEMORY STICKS. YOU HAVE NO COMPUTER CONNECTIONS TO W0RRY WITH. JUST INSERT THE FLOPPY DISK INTO YOUR COMPUTER AND YOUR PICTURES ARE READY TO BE TAKEN OFF WITH THE SOFTWARE SONY PROVIDES. IT ALSO COMES WITH A RECHARGEABLE BATTERY AND A POWER CORD. ...I AM GLAD I PURCHASED IT."
3,"Mostly good, but some bad cans","I've had plenty of trouble even in supermarkets when it comes to anchovies. Sometimes you open up a can and its all mush or spoiled. Well these were mostly good, but there were still a bunch that had a foul odor and/or the tins were puffing up. Especially as it got near the expiration date there were an increasing number of tins which were puffing up and spoiled (and a nice explosion of oil when you open them!). But overall I was happy with my purchse since I got it at a good price."
3,Wonderful material,"The colors and material are wonderful, too bad the sewing doesn't match. The embroidry thread shrank and the pillowcased weren't cut straight. After the first washing they were very mishapen."
4,longer lashes,"Love this mascara, the only draw back is the steam room. If a go into the steam room, by the time I'm done, the tubes are all hanging down my face and it looks as if I'm wearing false eyelashes and they are all coming unglued. In drier environments, the tubes last longer than a normal mascara and they make my eyes look great."
4,Hagen Life-Glo Bulb,"This is an excellent color bulb to provide a natural color light--I use an 18 inch in a small glass bow front tank. It puts out a lot more light than the Coralife 10K and is not as blue. It also is not as yellow as the Tropical Sun or Sun-Glo bulbs and results in better colors on fish and the best colors of any lamp on river bottom gravel. My plant does well in it too. I wish Hagen provided the lamp in a 14W 15 inch size for my Hex. I don't have a double fixture lamp to try this bulb in tandem with another, but if I did I'd try it with an Aqua-Glo to see if the intense fish colors of the Aqua-Glo lamp combine well with the natural spectrum of the Life-Glo. I find the Sun-Glo a bit to yellow even in combo with the Aqua-Glo."
4,Great value,"Having been a long time tropical fish hobbyist, I've seen many lighting configurations. This bulb is an upgrade for most inexpensive fluorescent fixtures typically supplied with a less capable lamps. At 6700K, 95 LUX and 960 lumens it's a winner."
1,Very babyish pacifier book,"I was very disappointed in this Berenstain Bears book. The book is way too simple for my 24-month-old. The book does not tell a story. It basically tells about Baby Bear and how he needs his ""passie"" and it needs him. This worries his mother and dad. One day he gives it up, without rhyme or reason. This relieves his mother and dad.I don't know about you, but my daughter's paci does not ""need"" her, and I don't want to give her another reason like that to keep using it. If you are looking for a good book to encourage your child to stop using his or her paci, KEEP LOOKING!"
4,Way better than that chocolate croissant you're eating,"As a NV fan, I concur with earlier reviews that each of their CDs goes in a completely different direction. I really enjoy Acoustic Clubbing - it's cool, calm, and collected. I wish I was at a small hip cafe in Paris listening to them play live. From the opening track til ""Hasta Llegar"", they give a great spin on all their former tracks plus giving us some new ones to enjoy. Definitely a great CD to put on with my Sunday coffee."
5,Sarah Cracknell - yum,Sarah Cracknell has a wonderful voice. I usually question the dj as rock star thing... but this is a special compilation of some really hypnotic work. I wish there was a video for Lose That Girl!
1,Defective ...,I received this unit with great expectation and was disappointed. The directions were incomplete. A picture indicated using a regular screwdriver to assemble the parts. The screws functioned as set screws. After some difficulty I realized it was necessary to use a no. 0 phillips screw driver. After attempting assembly with the proper tools and an assistant holding the parts I was unable to move the set screw. ...
2,Oregon scientific weather station,I returned this item as advised by the company's technical service person. Assembly required removing and reinstalling dozens of tiny screws for which no ordinary screwdriver was available.
1,Oregon Alfalfa Farmer,"I have purchased two of these Weather Stations and I feel the quality is very poor(as most China made products tend to be). I've had to return both. The first was defective out of the box, was returned and I purchase the second. Lasted 3 weeks, with the rain gauge quiting and the outside temp/baro showing 80% humidity with a record rainfall, go figure!!!. The rain gauge only dumps every .04"" of rain ergo the accuracy of the rain fall suffers. The instruction manual, as stated by the Tech people at Oregon Sientific was Chinese translated by a Russian. My dollars are going elseware. Davis Instruments. My recommendation ---- Dont buy!!!"
2,WMR968,"The WMR968 was shipped defective. Amazon. COM was excellent in sending a replacement unit. The manufacture didn't return my e-mails or voice messages until 4+ weeks later. I would highly recommend Amazon, would not recommend this manufacture.The WMR968 does a good job at tracking the weather."
2,OS=Marketing,"Oregon Scientific is purely a marketing company. I've been ""experiencing"" their shoddy products for nearly 10 years now. If you look at their executive staff, it's all people with sales and marketing experience -- no one seriously technical or product oriented. This product shows it. As most reviews have indicated, if your a cash-poor amateur with some technical skills, this can be made to perform reasonably well in what I consider the short term. What happens a year or two down the road when the solar-sensors and the poor connectors fail I don't know. Also, it's not made for any kind of serious weather. The rain gauge obviously has no heater so you won't get anything in the snowfall department. As has been indicated, the anemometer reports windspeed on a whimisical basis. Overall, this is a pleasant enough toy if you feel like playing with toys. If you want a weather instrument, go with a real one."
3,Careful !!!,"I purchased this unit. Works fine, communicates with software package purchased separately, HOWEVER, it does NOT have the atomic clock feature of most Oregon Scientific clocks. The clock update feature is one way only, from weather station to PC. I have atomic clock software on my PC, so I cannot use this feature. Oregon Scientific customer service said that the self-adjust feature was supposed to be included in the units, but was not, and that they had no plans to fix it. Otherwise, the performance is great if you remember that this is a burst transmission and not continous."
4,weather station,It took about 4 hours to complete the installation. It worked right out of the box as advertised. You need tools and experience with building and installing electrical type projects i.e. Heath Kits. If you like tinkering around. This is for you. If you want instant stuff forget it. It is wireless but will not jump out of the box and set up it's self up.
2,Not what I expected,"The unit is somewhat disappointing. The 1st humidity gage we had stopped working and the 2nd is wildly inaccurate. The screen on the unit stays backlit for only a few seconds even with the power plugged in. This makes it hard to read unless you want to press the display every time you want to see something. The directions are useless; if you ignore them and just use common sense it is pretty easy to set up if you know the following tricks: 1) open every unit and remove the protective strip in between the contacts and the batteries for the solar cells, 2) press the reset on the master unit when all sensors/units have the battery strips removed. The solar cells connect in an obvious manner with the back off of each unit. The unit is OK; you get what you pay for so don't expect a lot but it does function."
4,Oregon Scientific - somewhat mis-leading.,"The name 'Oregon scientific' is a bit misleadng, as the product is manufactured in China. While the product works satisfactorily, the instructions were the worst I have seen recently. Example: each of the sending units (3) must be connectedto the datadevices via standard phone connector. However, there is no exterior recepticle; eachunit must be taken apart, and the screws are so tiny, most available screwdrivers willnot fit. And the instructions do NOT cover this procedure. Also, touch pad controls are not intuitive (at least for Americans). I have to refer to the instructions way too frequently to use the device."
1,Many Problems,"I bought this unit about 4 years ago and could only get the temperature and humidity gauges to work correctly. It was impossible to get the wind gauge to work correctly because it seems you need robotic laser leveling on all planes to have it perfectly level. It would spin and and measure at about 1/4 of actual speed. The same goes for the rain gauge. I tested it by spraying water from the garden hose in a shower pattern and it registered nothing. When it rained I went out and looked inside and saw that the see-saw measuring aparatus was working, yet I got no reading. All components were communicating with the base station so I have no idea why these two would not work. For rain measurment I went back to my graduated plastic rain gauge that I hang on the fence and for wind speed I guess by looking at the trees and I stick a wet finger in the air or toss a few blades of grass in the air for direction."
2,Died after 2 years,"I bought this unit about 2 years ago. I had to return the initial unit because it did not work correctly (thanks to Cabellas customer service). The second unit worked well for a while (yes it was a long set-up), but we were happy with it. The rain guage stopped working pretty early on, as did the humidity/weather condition sensor. However, the 2 parts we used most, which were the temperature readings in and out and the anemometer, seemed to work very well until we hit the 2 year mark. Then the whole unit went out and no matter of new batteries, reset, or anything else will make the unit function. It might be inexpensive for a weather station, but $240 is not cheap by my standards to have the product only last for 2 years. Not sure that I can recommend it. Too bad, because I think Oregon Scientific usually puts out a good product."
4,A good moderate price system,"I have had my weather station for two months now and have had no problems with it. The installation was fairly simple and the range on the satellite components seems to be quite adaquate. Now for the caviats. I wholly agree with the reviewers that complain about the multiple tiny screws that have to be removed on the satellite units to replace the battery. I had to buy a Jewler's Screwdriver to get the right size blade. I can't immagine myself standing on the peak of my roof replacing the battery in the Anemometer on a windy January day without losing half the screws (or maybe falling off the roof myself). The display unit does not have a continous lighted setting even on external power. You must keep touching the screen to keep it lit. I would suggest buying a companion computer program to display the units outputs. I chose Ambient Weather's program and am very happy with it.All in all, this is a good amature Weather Station at a resonable price."
4,Almost Serious Weather Station,"Station is easy to set up and fun to put on the internet.Technical support and documentation is a bit fuzzy, but there are several outside sources of help.Sensor accuracy and resolution could be better. Temperature is good, but the other parameters taper off from there.The best software is usually the most expensive unless you are a good programmer."
3,Weather Station,It really nice only the anometer stopped working. I emailed for support with no luck
3,Instruction Manual is poorly written.,"You have to read between the lines a lot when assembling this unit. Not too difficult if you have some mechanical knowledge. So far so good, time will tell on its longevity when in operation."
1,WMR Reliability,"My system is installed in a hot humid climate (Bahamas) within 200ft of the ocean. It was working perfectly for 7 month. Then, one after the other, the following parts failed:1. Humidity ~7mos2. Temperature ~9mos3. Wind Speed -10mos4 Wind Direction -12 mosAll units installed inside and the rain gage continue to operate.Obviously the WMR968 is not designed for this environment. So it makes no sense to keep replacing parts. I plan to dump the WMR968 and replace it with a more reliable weather system.ADDENDUM 9/2012I replaced it with Davis Instruments Vantage Pro2 Weather Station (Wireless). This product is more reliable, The battery had to replaced after 18 month and the wind sensor went bad after 2 years."
2,Extremely poor. Very in-accurate readings.,"Don't waste your time or money. If you want a Weather Station that gives accurate readings, buy the Davis. It can be found for not much more than this trash.The readings on the Oregon are all over the map."
1,"Horrible, horrible installation instructions","I am in the process of installing this weather station and the instructions omit about 60% of the important stuff such as the following: 1) You have to take the back off the wireless/solar devices to connect them. That involves removing eight tiny screws. 2) Calibrating the anemometer is very unclear to get wind direction right. I finally figured out that you have to mount it on a pole. Oregon Scientific (fancy American name for cheap stuff made in China) said I did not need to. Nowhere is this key point addressed in the instructions. 3) I had problems putting in the wind vane. It clicks into place, but the instructions say nothing about that. That's as far as I've gotten, but someone else's review that it'll take 4-6 hours to install is on the money.I would not buy this product again and am not confident it will operate over the long term. I expect to run into other problems."
2,You can do better... poor service,"I love the product, price is right....BUT quality is POOR and SERVICE is even worse!!!!!!!!!!! I have had two of these units over the past 3 years in San Diego CA and have had numerous sensors break and main unit malfunction. The service department at Oregon Scientific is very hard to get ahold of, it took 4 calls and 2 emails and I got a response after 4 days!!! Again I love the weather station, and maybe you get what you pay for at that price."
3,Killer Carlin,"This is an album of very early George Carlin material; during his days with Jack Burns as a stand-up duet. It doesn't sound grainy, fortunately, but only the die-hard Carlin fans will be able to tell him from Burns (mainly because it's all parody material where they're using different voices). Also, it's not very long, and some of the tracks are incomplete, but it's the only cd of his pre-solo material, so it's a must-buy for all Carlin fans (especially those not fortunate enough to have the very rare ""Burns & Carlin at the Playboy"" LP)."
2,Vintage recording..but mastered at the wrong speed!,"This is indeed a vintage recording of George Carlin with Jack Burns when they used to be a team back in the early 60's. The material is very dated which is expected, and truthfully not that funny, and the recording quality is not too good.The most annoying thing about this release is it was mastered at the wrong speed. Yes, George and Jack were younger back then but WAY past the age of puberty so their voices were not THAT much higher!! I am fortunate to have heard an original copy of the album, so apon hearing this CD for the first time was a bit of a shock.The cover is a total joke as well. It shows Carlin in his later days which gives no indication of the vintage recording contained inside. This cd is only for the collector.(I bought a copy, re-mastered it and corrected the speed using Sound Forge, then made a beautiful cover using an appropriate picture of ""Burns & Carlin"")Now I have to find a way to unload the ""speeded up version"""
1,Try something else,"My friend bought this tape at a Quicky-Mart type establishment. It was some early '60s ensemble, with the only remotely mildly funny part provided by Carlin (who's hardly on the album at all). If you want Carlin, stick with Back in Town etc."
1,is not satisfied,"I have order this item since one month and i have not yet receive the item, what is the problem, i need some explanation otherwise i want to be refound, and i have payed the fast delevery, i don't understand why it take so long.Waiting for your reply.Alin Tsobgnie"
3,I like Klugh but this isn;t one his best,I got hooked on Klugh so ordered this cd. Its OK but not like the ones that got me into his sound.
4,Muy completo,"Este libro me a parecido muy completo ya que trae informaci√≥n de todo el juego ya sea los trabajos con su horario, sueldo y habilidades nescesarias, hasta los objetos con sus nombres, devaluaci√≥n por d√≠a y precio inicial, trae los pisos, las pintura para las paredes y m√°s. El libro en si es un guia exelente ya que no le hace falta ni un aspecto con respecto al juego, lo √∫nico que se le podria mejorar es en la parte de estrategia, parte la cual la escritora tiene que dar por ella misma y no por el juego, ya que solo nos da tres aspectos que nos podrian ayudar durante el juego, basandose en conseguir dinero f√°cil. Yo por mi parte tengo algunas dudas, ¬øExiste alguna forma para ganar los puntos de habilidades m√°s f√°cil y r√°pido?, ¬øPor qu√© a mi no me sirven los trucos solo algunos?. Esas son las √∫nicas preguntas que me han quedado despu√©s de leer el libro pero aparte de eso no tengo preguntas, es realmente un libro de el juego Los Sims muy completo."
2,...FAR FROM TWO PAGES,"After I heard ""two pages"" I was very anxious to listen to a new release from 4 heroes, when I saw ""creating patterns"" at the shop I immediately bought it BUT....it is far from what that great record was...the ideas are more or less the same but a less brilliant, the sounds also.....Of the whole record i would save a couple of songs....now I understand why it is sold at a low price...If you take ""two pages"" avoid this record, it will disappoint your aspectatives"
4,Is this 4 real?,"BILL 486For about three years now, I have come to love this '4 Hero' for their alternative 'jazzy-tech' sound. A little research showed me that these guys were more than just DJ's or 'remixers', they have preserved a period of time in music before the onslaught of exploitation and the ""video age"".Being from the UK, with a population that shows more appreciation,it's easier for them to promote the very roots of modern soul and jazz music, while at the same time cleverly creating a new musical sound that combines and trancends classical,hip-hop, jazz and R&B;."
4,Elec-soul,"4hero is an electronic, creative drum and bass unit who work with similar elements as the jazz-fusion, organic interplay of The Cinematic Orchestra, except in a more programmable context such as Jazzanova, offering a solidly sophisticated, expertly produced combo of vocal and instrumental dance-floor drive."
5,This Book Is All You Need....,"If you are thinking of building your first fence (as I was) or you just want to know proper techniques, this book was written for you. I was somewhat apprehensive over building my first fence but after reading this book I had the confidence to attempt it. I can not rate this book highly enough. Everything is detailed out in simple, plain English. The author does not assume any prior fence-building experience. Bottom Line: If you are thinking of building your own fence from scratch then this book will give you all the information you need. Excellent book."
1,Worthless and boring,"It's hard to believe Paula Franzese has won awards for her lecturing when you listen to these boring CD's.(I actually checked before I bought this CD-set!)Not only are her jokes lame and dated, but the pace is boringly slow, and the law sometimes wrong. Avoid this and go with Jurgensmeyer's CD's. Jurgensmeyer doesn't waste your time repeating everything twice, or talking really slowly, or telling dumb jokes like Franzese here."
4,More interesting than useful for cooking,"I like this little book a lot, but I think it's more interesting to read than the recipes are innovative. They're pretty basic old-fashioned recipes."
4,Garth Brooks,"I was very anxious to acquire this album, and I was very pleased with the time in which it arrived."
4,Just what she wanted,I ordered this after my wife mentioned how good it was. It was a Christmas gift for her and she was overwhelmed when she got it. It was shipped quickly and arrived in the advertised condition (if not better).
4,"Fast Shipment, but damaged case","I was very happy with the speedy arrival of this cd, because I had ordered it as a gift for my mother. I wanted her to be able to enjoy it throughout the Christmas season, and it arrived quickly enough to make that possible. The cover WAS cracked, which is something that I didn't expect, but I'm sure that if I had sent it back, it would've been replaced. I chose to keep it so that my mother could have the cd now. And as little as I paid for this CD, I really can't complain about a small crack!"
1,Garth ain't Elvis,What is the purpose of this lousy CD? I suspect Brook's huge ego compelled him to put this joke together. Too bad he doesn't have the talent to pull it off. Plenty of good Xmas albums out there. Ask your parents for a good one.
5,plays great,the only thing that i would complain about is there was no cover for the CD but the CD plays very well and I am very happy with it
4,A MUSTFOR CHRISTMAS MUSIC,"I HAVE HEARD SONGS HERE THAT I HAVE NEVER HEARD BEFORE. BEING NEW TO THE COMPUTER, HAS BROUGHT ME BACK IN TOUCH WITH THIS FATASTIC COLLECTION THAT I LOST MOVING TO CALIFORNIA.I AM ORDERING IT NOW TO ENJOY THIS YEAR AND FOR MANY TO COME"
5,Garth Brooks.,Love his music and this CD was great for the holiday season. It was great for the kids to listen to as well.
1,The Titanic sinks again.......to new lows,"I am a Titanic buff and read everything I can find about it, then I saw this book and once I was done I realized the horrible truth. I was tricked into reading a romance novel! This ""book"" was originally titled Icefall, but was changed in order to jump on the Titanic bandwagon. rs. O'Cork wants us to beleive that Bruce Ishmay was gay and that Captain Smith was too busy making out with a divorcee to go on the ship. The ending is a travesty and the main characters are atrocious, there are actually twins named Smoke and Swan. If any body gets a copy of this book just throw in the bottom of a lake, it'll serve it's purpose better there than in your hands"
1,I give it no stars,"This book, in a word, sucked. She paints Captain Smith as being a man who couldn't think about anything but sex, Bruce Ismay as being homosexual (maybe he was but I don't want to know about it!!!) and why on earth did she name those two girls SWAN and SMOKE!!??I just couldn't get past that..."
1,Actually one-half star is more accurate,Ms. O'Cork does a real disservice to the actual people on board the Titanic and to any reader who has genuine interest in the historical facts. She could just as easily have written a completely fictional book with all characters and the ship itself being only similar to the actual event and not extrapolated from the real thing.
2,Not for the serious Titanic collector,"Miss O'Cork's novel is advertised as a romance. That much is true. There is so much romance going on that it's no wonder the Titanic ran into an iceberg. If you are a collector of books about the Titanic, pass on this one. If the typical romance novel interests you, then Titanic will probably fit the bill."
1,An early version of the Love Boat,"I believe, that when a person writes a work of fiction that involves historical characters, they should at least try to make the actions of those characters at least somewhat consistent with their known actions. This is not the case with this novel. If you care about the story of the Titanic, you will probably find this treatment of the tragedy disturbing for it inaccuracy and innuendo. If you don't care about the disaster, the romance might be interesting, but please don't believe anything about any of the characters."
5,Never imagined Giant Robo could be this funny,"Johnny Sokko and His Flying Robot was my favorite tv show when I was a kid. Although I was a bit disappointed with the confusing story line of the animated Giant Robo (only saw VHS version, heard DVD dub makes more sense), I thought I'd get this video.I'm glad I did. I especially enjoyed the first two episodes (the ones with huge robots fighting). It was an interesting glimpse into the lives of some of the characters outside of work.Be sure to play it with the English subtitles on. The dub and subtitles are slightly different translations."
1,Not so great compared to The Day the Earth Stood Still series,"This series takes place roughly after the first episode of the Day the Earth Stood Still series. Although it is nice to see some of the characters that die in the above series alive again, this is played more as a parody. Don't get me wrong, I love parodies, but this one just isn't that funny. Plus the series seems to be unsure if this is supposed to be a parody or serious so the result is largely uneven. I would avoid buying this."
4,A major artist,"Exceptional singer, excellent musician, Daniel signs his 4th album with ""Le coeur ouvert"". Produced by Pascal Obispo, wonderful songs of love in a large sens. I envoy it very much !"
4,An excellent resource,"We use this book at home to ""look up"" dogs we do not recognize, and to look up dogs that people talk about that we may be unfamiliar with. There are lots of pictures so even the kids use it. It has a lot of pertinent information about each breed, including origin, size, weight, and recommendations for pet owners. I will probably order another....just in case the first one walks off."
3,Similar to Metsudah: Chumash/Rashi,"It is a traditional edition of Rashi's commentary on Pentateuch (Chumash, Torah) with very similar content to Metsudah: Chumash/Rashi, but slightly different graphically. Namely, the text on each page is very clearly and simply written in a table with 4 columns like spreadsheet instead of the linear composition in two parallel columns of the Metsudah. It lacks the literality of translation and the distinction of Rashi's text from the text by others (explaining Rashi) using a bold typeface, like the Sapirstein Edition (Artscroll) has. The paper used was of a high quality, so it still remains bright and clear even in the 1949 editions. The typeface was also good."
5,Diviny's writing encourages kids to be imaginative,"Since television, computer and video games have become the overwhelming medium in our society. The book, Snow Inside the House, clearly suggest that kids can still and continue to have their imaginative power. Mr. Diviny, and his beautifully rhymed text, clearly suggest that he still has the grasp on what it's like being a child. I congratulate Mr. Diviny for his achievement."
4,Check it out...,"Blackalicious finally got a major label to release their album. But sometimes this can end up biting artists in the arse. But this album definately grew on me, it was a bit hard to listen to some tracks the first time around. Don't get me wrong, I love the album, I just think it lost some of that raw musical emotion that was present on Melodica and A2G. Anyways, it's party music and it still makes you think. The Gift of Gab hasn't let me down yet."
4,"Great music, but they've done better","A first time Blackalicious listener might give this album 5 stars. And I couldn't blame 'em. With their madly creative lyrics and unparalleled instrumentals, Gift of Gab and Chief Xcel epitomize underground hiphop. However, ""Blazing Arrow"" doesn't (and maybe can't) set the kinds of precedents that these guys did with their earlier albums. Don't get me wrong, it's really good (""Make You Feel That Way"" is one of the highlight tracks), but some of it is just under par--whereas an album like ""Nia"" was awesome from start to finish. Do I recommend this CD? Definitely. But with it I'd say you have to listen to Blackalicious' other works (""Nia"", ""A2G"", and ""Melodica"") to round out your experience."
5,I'm a spinning top in a world of standstill onlookers,"Blackalicious, that describes it all. What music's true purpose to me is, make you feel good! I mean, what can it better serve you than a plate of lovin goodness. I personally like feeling good about my life. At times I feel worthless and weak, but other times I feel my soul. Blackalicious - Blazing Arrow gives me that type of feeling, the feeling that I can do something with my life just because of the simple fact that I want to, and I will goddamnit, cause life is good, and it's easy no matter what you think of it. For some people though, it truly aint easy and we got to get out and help these folks out. Blazing has a bunch of different highlights to it, soulful R&B choruses, raw lyrical talent, and a woven web of the beauty of culture and positive influence. Thanks Blackalicious, this album is what we all need."
5,WOW!!,"This CD is amazing!!Buy It Now. Any rap collection isnt complete without this album. Mainstream Rap is C*#P. Any real rap/hip-hop fan knows this. Even though Blackalicious signed with a bigger label they didnt sell out...it is still a great album. This Cd has SOUL somthing that mainstrem rap misses badly. So go out and pick this CD up, Now."
3,Some extinguished flames,"It's hard to fault the wordy emcee for effort, but with much ambition coming from the rap and beat departments BA still often exudes a showy corniness when not dazzling in syllabic seance."
2,What is everyone listening to?,"I have been a huge Blackalicious fan - seen them live 3 times and the whole Quannum crew at the Solesides show at Bimbo's 365 in San Francisco last year.Melodica - fantastic, A to G EP - excellent, NIA - outstanding, Quannum Spectrum - awesome, Blazing Arrow - weak. There are a few tracks that stand out - the track with Gil Scott Heron is nice. The rest are weak attempts at R&B influenced hip hop. Track 5-7, 9 and 11 are disgusting examples of how good hip hop units use R&B to dominate songs.Frankly, I have seen enough good hip hop groups sell out - Tribe, Mos Def, Outkast. When is this going to stop.Do yourself a favor - buy one of the early Quannum records or go pick up the new J-Live record instead."
2,Disappointing,"I was looking for something of the caliber of Jurassic 5's Quality Control - this was an almost random purchase for me having never heard these guys before - this album was linked to J5 on the website so I took a chance (after reading a lot of the reviews and sampling two or three tracks).After listening to it a couple of times, I've realized that most of the tracks on here are R&B; influenced drivel. Why talented lyricists feel the need to ruin a decent track with some chick bleating indecipherable whines is beyond me.Stand out tracks Blazing Arrow and Chemical Calisthenics drag this album out of the mire of one star and into the less-than-respectable bog of two stars.Don't bother buying the album, just buy Blazing Arrow and Chemical Calisthenics and move on."
1,dont let money change ya...,"blackalicious,very disapointing record. i have been a fan for years and been to many, many shows. picked it up only to hear another independent act conform to major label quotas. when was quannum synonomous to jiggy pop? if nia was the purpose and this is the path, where are you headed? what happened?please do not deny your blatant decision to sell out. yes, there are 3 really nice tracks. however, xcel no longer excells and gift of gab now sings? i guess your arrow is pointing in the same direction as mos def's. i'll watch you on the next mtv hip hopera.get your money blackalicious. i was hoping you could resurrect a dying genre. remember:so if you're blessed with the talentutilize it to the fullestbe true to yourselfand stay humble.mca picked you up to continue what you firmly and unanimously held down for years. please bring it back."
3,not up to par with other alternative hip hop albums,"While I can't say that Blazing Arrow is a masterpiece, it does have a few good songs like the one with Charli 2na, Paragraph President and the song that Cut Chemist produced. Other than that, this album just didn't satify me all the way, some of the beats are kind of wack and Lateef the Truthspeaker from the Quannum collective is a horrible rapper, he makes a couple of cameos on this album. However I did like NIA, Blackalicious' first album, but this album has way to many wack beats and flows from Gift of Gab. Gift of Gab has talent no doubt in rapping, but this album only scratches the surface of what he can do. After I heard this album, I had a new perspective of looking at Blackalicious as a Jurassic 5 or Dilated Peoples rip-off. I think that those two crews make a tiny bit better alternative hip hop than Blackalicious, no offense, but this album did no do it for me, like NIA did."
3,Disappointing typesetting ...,"I got this book and happily started to read it, only to discover an entire phrase left out of a sentence and typos in it - very disappointing, as it otherwise is very good. If you're the sort of person who is immediately ""turned off"" by lack of attention to detail, especially in a hard cover book that you've eagerly awaited the arrival of, then be warned! If you can look beyond that, then certainly it is worth the read ..."
2,Classical Dressage at It's Best,Classical dressage explained in a clear manner to help rider and horse be their best. Excellent read! 5 stars!
2,Disappointing...,"With all of the great reviews and the author's reputation, I was expecting a lot more. I just don't see anything new here, to me it reads like a dictionary on dressage. Fine, but not too interesting. I guess what really put me off straight away, was the the author's claim that horses are not very intelligent, and if they were we would be afraid to be near them at all. And ""A horse will never do anything on purpose"". I think that anyone who has spent a lot of time around horses would disagree with that statement. For example, if you have ever seen a horse work open a stall latch, I think you might agree that they are capable of doing things on purpose and with planning. From someone who supposedly stresses love for the horse during training, I found these statements quite inaccurate and somewhat cold. I've got loads of books on dressage, and this one would be at the bottom of my list."
5,Timeless information for all levels,"I have owned this book for many years, and had lent it to one too many people (last one failed to return it). I use it regularly as a reference guide each time I move up to a new level of dressage, so I bought another copy and will never lend it out again. Needless to say, I highly recommend this book. It explains, in fairly detailed but clear language, the aids for each dressage movement. In addition, it outlines what not to do, and mistakes to watch for. I also use this book as a refresher for movements I've already ""mastered"" and regularly discover something I missed the first time through. While no single dressage book can cover all of this complex sport, I consider this the single best resource that every aspiring dressage rider should own."
3,Caller BMT,"Cora is has a nice personality. She is causous,average IQ because she answers the phone that nobody has the number to,but her and the land lord.The plot is that someone is calling Cora to be her friend.Cora thinks he is crazy. She called her boy friend to tell him what happened.The person treatens her, and makes the phone choke her."
4,I like this book because of the Indian Leagions,"This book was good, no great... Im not really into all the romances and stuff but i read this and I really liked it. Cait Londen is a great auther and I think the series of the Tallchief Indeans is really cool. The book is cute with the girl Fiona growning up with all her brothers and being a litle manly and then you got the man, one hell of a man Joel. Hes a man the comes into her life thinking shes a convict because after a event she takes him to a hide-away..Fiona is a crazy character that wants her virginity to be broken and she also rides around on elephants...and Joel is the kinda man to get what he wants. So if I were you I would go buy this book right away!"
1,Can you say cheap?,"This was the thinnest coat I've ever seen. Plus the sizing chart on the website is wrong. I ordered my husband a 38 and it was too tight. Yet I found another one for him in JC Penney of the same size and it fits perfectly. This coat is a you get what you paid for item. Cheap in price and cheaply made. And when you return it, they don't return all your money. Horrible. The worst purchase ever from Amazon."
3,Not such a great deal,"I bough it for my husband and he kind of like it, the style and the cut. But at the end the material looks low quality and everything sticks to it. Is kind of embarrassing.Every time after he use it I got to clean it with the sticky roll.It is a very convenient price but not sure it is worth to sacrifice the quality..."
3,A Just-OK General Reference,"Clear and well structured, it manages to miss -- or dismiss -- some XP nuances in its bias toward the ""classic windows"" way of doing things. There's a subtle ""I-know-what's-best"" tone, which plays in stark contrast to its pretensions to be authoritative. Opinions are fine, but here they serve well neither novice PC users nor power users looking to evaluate the pros and cons of new OS features. For readers in either group, a different XP desk reference might be the way to go."
1,Disappointing,"I found this a rather disappointing tome, given its weight. In many cases it merely lists the obvious at great length. The index is poor, and the organisation is confusing. I found the lack of tips and absence of special insights frustrating as these have been good a feature of previous reference works like Windows 95 Secrets by Livingston & Straub . I wonder at whom this bland work is really targeted. Best to look elsewhere for a main XP reference. I regretted my purchase."
4,"""sparkling,"" frantic satire","Sparkle Hayter has penned an exhilarating, rousing romp through NYC, full of zany adventures and loony characters. I loved the novel's rollicking pace. The dialogue, specifically the witty comments made by Robin Hudson separate this from any other novel of this genre I have read. I couldn't wait to read what Robin would say next.This is an outstanding satire on modern relationships and issues or just life in general. Literacy aside, what makes the novel are so many off-beat characters and frantic plot twists. You never know what's around the next corner on this playful ride."
4,Trials of many kinds,"This book was very easy reading. It was hard to put down, finished in one day. Was a great spritual uplift. Would recommend for reading. I would like to read the sequeal when available."
1,Oregon Scientific AS316E Lite Touch Travel Alarm,"I bought it, but it became crazy. Still, this is time I don't know buy. I would suggest not to buy it"
3,A rather expressionless video,The video had the potential to be one of the great video's thatPlayboy produced but instead is a bit below par with most of thevideo's that Playboy has produced. There is a nice variety of sets and women but you get the feeling that Playboy could have done better in both catagories. Joy Behrman stripping in the theater was outstanding and pushed this video to a 3 stars otherwise I would have rated it a 2.
3,Lost potential.,"I must agree with the previous reviewer and say that a greatdeal more could have been done to make this feature better. It seemsPlayboy can't get past the self-touching, quasi-masturbatory movements for their models. Do they consider their models so pure that they must remain disconnected from their environment and spectators while they touch themselves? And does the action have to be soooo slow? And so scripted? After you've seen several Playboy productions, you can almost predict how the models are going to move and touch themselves. The civilian airplane scene is the lone exception."
3,one of the best Playboy videos,This is one of my favorite Playboy titles. Once again the use of actual Playmates is limited but all the girls are of that gorgeous Playmate calibre. Some segments feature more daring camera angles than others but on the whole I found them all staged on a very erotic level. So why only 3 stars? The picture quality on this DVD left much to be desired. The source from segment to segment varies and the DVD just points out the limited resolution in a number of instances.
3,Don't buy it for decks,"I found this product to be great for visualizing internal home remodeling projects. But when I wanted to use it to try on new deck designs, I found that the only shape of deck you can attach to your model is a rectangle. Very disappointing."
4,Modular Home Design,"3D Home Archetect is a user friendly piece of software. However, the instructions become weak when a complex roof design is required. One must be carefull of changing colors of walls, annotation etc. because default colors may be obliterated and no longer visible. Example, making the walls darker obliterates the wall breaks, resulting in multiple breaks w/o being able to see where they are. Roof designs and gables where there no windows, doors or openings have not yet been found in the program. Also, do not say NO to save as it shuts the PROGRAM down in Win XP. Program needs help in the door opening area as it tends to call up Microsoft most times when you try to change the dirction of a door opening."
4,Good product but...,"It could have been a little more intuitive for those of us who don't want to sit down and read the THICK 300 page manual.The interface is also filled with uncommon methods of navigation and graphic manipulation. Its not hard to figure out, but it would have been nice if they stuck with typical conventions."
5,"Excellent for home design, 3D viewing","With the computer system: 733MHz, 133MHz bus, 128MB, SCSI 160 MHz 18GB disk system running WIN98. The software runs extremely fast and is more stable and faster than Version 3 and much better than the IMS and other inexpensive design programs. Have used the software to design a 2 story addition with full basement, accurate roof design, and wrap-around first floor porch.Have also used software to accurately build two rooms of our present house and filled the rooms with the furniture that we have. This is in preparation to changing the position of furnishings in these rooms. The 3D camera view allows quick understanding of what works and what does not work in furnishing."
5,Great Software,"We used 3D Home Architect to design our current house. During our meetings with the builder and architect, we would bring print outs we had made from the night before to better express our ideas. We quickly found we had a better imagination than our builder did.I don't think you can really do the entire design yourself on this software; it is not that exact or flexible. Cabinet work has severe limitations too.But you can export DXF files which be imported into higher-end CAD systems and it is REAL easy to use."
3,Best that I have used,"I purchased this program several months ago and have designed my new home. I found it very easy to use and make changes. It is limited in objects and textures but it does good with what it has. My house is one level. But I played around with a second level which is a bit harder. I did not master that part. The program shows all measurements, calculates sq ft, has great 3d views, and basicly prints a usable floor plan. I recently purchased the new Deluxe 5 Professional. It is like they started back at sq 1. stay away from it."
1,Worst ever!,"This program is so full of bugs that space doesn't permit a full explanation. The program continually locks up my computer in 3d view and I have to press the reset button to restart Windows 2000. When I start it up again the dimensions are in metric not English! There is no way to restore this but to uninstal/reinstall...If you have version 3.0, stick with it. I've returned this bug-ridden program for a refund. It's a waste of time and money. I'd give it ""0 Stars"" but the form won't let me..."
3,Lots of designs but only 1 in the sq. ft we're looking for,"I was very disappointed to find only 1 plan that fits what we're looking for as far as Sq. Ft. Also only one log home plan the size of an outhouse practically!! Very disappointing. Program only allows you to edit in plan view where it would be FAR easier to do in 3D mode as then you can see what your working on and how it looks.If you're planning on building a small home-this would be a good deal if you have the time,patience and a fast computer as that's what you need when working with program."
3,"Good product, needs work","This program is cool to design a house with, but i found it has a lot of things u can't do, but overall it isn't bad. One of my major peeves of the program is that when u put in say a table or a piece of furniture, the main color is always a horrible woodgrain, even the cars, and sometimes it is hard to change. The terrain is another problem it is square, no hills, u are basically left to build a structure on a perfectly flat surface, which is rarely true. But the program is incredibly easy to use, even for a high schooler like me. I would recomend this product for anyone who just wants an idea of how there new house would look, and i would not go into great detail in your plan, this is just a general program."
2,Least of all evils I guess,"Has some powerful features, but not a very quality product. Don't expect the quality that is in most microsoft products we use every day. For instance:- a help index that had all the necessary key words- an index in the manual that is worthwhile- Nonspecific error codes that persistently appear leaving you to guess what is causing them- no keyboard shortcuts (esp for critical items like zoom, etc.)- all kinds of little bugs here & there- no implementation of mouse wheel, etc.For floor planning only I'd recommend Visio 2003 - a realy quality product with all the dimensioning you really need.It's a pity to see them put this much effort into a product, and then shoot themselves in the foot with sooo many little shortcomings."
2,"cumbersome, clunky user interface","While the program performs some functions adequately, I cannot recommend it if there are better products available. The biggest problem that I have with this version, is the User Interface. Everything seems to be geared toward working with just one thing at a time, a wall, a chair, or a single mouse click. No facility is provided for repeating anything via keyboard or mouse strokes. Unless you like exercising patience more than actually getting anything done, find a better program."
1,Not suitable for purpose,"This software is not suitable for designing houses. Wall thickness limited to 12""; roof pitches are not capable of being set to 40 degrees (the standard for plain tiling and slates) or more; material listing seems to be oriented towards American timber frame houses; 3d editing does not appear to work."
4,Very Useful,"I found this software easy to load, understand and use. That is not to say that it doesn't have a few frustrating quirks like all software but, in the main, I found it very useful in designing an addition to my home."
1,Cracked clock faces,"The clock arrived with both plastic face covers cracked. They probably cracked during transit, but it's cheaply made anyway. The clock doesn't exactly resemble the picture. The face of the clock is not white; it's more like yellow. Also, the clock isn't 22"" in diameter. That's the overall size. The diameter of the clock is closer to 15""."
5,magnet,"excellent material, great magnet, it really doesn't move at all in the fridge.Good paint job, I will buy more of this."
5,I guess you just have to be into it,"This one is by far my favorite, and although many would disagree with me, I think it's mainly because I'm heavily punk-oriented. And I think this album allowed the Surfers' punk ego to shine the most, since they're not actually considered a real punk band, but rather a unique psychedelic rock band. It also contains tons more upbeat energy than any other, but I'd have to say the true sellout days came only after this one, with Electriclarryland and afterwards."
2,One last gasp,"is what this record is. A brief renaissance before they slipped under the sellout/burnout ocean. Rocks hard, and in a structure that the average hard rock fan will not be frightened of. Excellent balladry on ""Tongue"". ""The Annoying Song"" is truly that, but in a good way. Its better than my rating suggests...I just know this isn't 1/3 of what this band could do to your brain. It is a very good hard rock record, I suppose, but the Buttholes existed to make your jaw drop and your ear hurt, and I'm too desensitized to their brand of brutality to not be all that impressed with this. And, if you want a better cut of Gibby throwing up than ""Clean It Up"", I suggest you check 'Cream Corn From The Socket of Davis' ""Comb"" circa 1985. Less concentration on the throwing up and weirder music accompanying it. I hope I was able to help."
2,I've got this Cd and was greatly disappointed.,"Like all of the above reviewers, I love this recording and feel that it stands for the best that 70's country-rock had to offer. I found it 4 years ago as an Japanese import. (apparently many other folks bought it too). While I was excited to finally own this music on a Cd, the quality of the transfer work pretty much ruined the recording. Either by over-compressing, or misusing Dolby noise reduction - the songs came out muffled - with a ""halting"" quality - missing the smooth musical stream intended. Since then, I've found clean used Lp copies - and will probably ""burn"" my own Cd from there. Not as good as a master tape - generated Cd - but better than the import. Good luck - it's worth it."
3,Eagles look alike,"A nice album that reminds a lot The Eagles. Not all the tracks are great, but that also applies to the initial Eagles records..."
4,Fit like a glove,It fit like it should in my '93 audi model 90 quattro. The check engine light finally turned off in my car
1,superstitions puzzle,The puzzle is great and fun to do but the website does not give you a complete list of the superstitions--there is a gray box covering the bottom half. I reached out to the company but have yet to get a reply. It has been over a week....very disappointing.
5,So fun!,It took me and my boyfriend 2 days to complete this puzzle. We were completely hooked and couldn't stop working on it. The puzzle pieces are uniquely shaped and the set came with complete pieces. Very satisfied with the product.
5,really fun puzzle!,"This is a great puzzle--not too challenging, but takes a while, since there are 1,500 pieces. The different scenes are fun to put together--they represent scenes from 24 well-known fairy tales. Also, the puzzle is good quality and hangs together well when finished. I just hung mine up on the wall by glue-gunning four of the top pieces to rings--didn't need to glue the puzzle together."
4,Great puzzle!,"My family had a lot of fun with this puzzle over the holidays. It's got lots of little scenes to work on, so everyone can pick a section. It was fun to figure out all the fairy tales, too. My only problem was that the pieces didn't seem to fit together consistently. Some felt pretty loose, and others had to be squeezed in a bit, so I took off one star for quality."
3,"Fun puzzle, but not sure about quality","I was really looking forward to receiving this puzzle. It has a lovely, fun image, and I immediately started working on it. However, as soon as I started putting it together I noticed that the pieces are very loose, even when correctly fitted. The puzzle is great and I'm glad I got it, but just be warned that it's not easy to move sections around - they fall apart easily."
2,Missing ONE PIECE!,"So this was a super fun puzzle to work on. I loved all the different stories and collecting pieces of all the different characters. Seems well made and the pieces interlock well.However, when we finished, we were missing a piece!! And we don't have any kids or pets to loose the pieces. It's pretty discouraging to ""finish"" a puzzle but not really be ""finished"". And I can assure you that I will never do this puzzle again knowing it is missing a piece. Quite a bummer..."
2,"Author had good intentions, but story disappointing.","I think what went wrong is that I had a lot of expectations to this novel and I thought I was about to read an ""Ellie Haskall-like"" storyline complete with that wonderful british wit and humor that this author so wonderfully puts to paper.However, I could not get very involved with the storyline and I ended up ""Plowing"" through the book just to get it done. My only interest turned out to be the Silver Spoon that was missing for 200 years and I was looking forward to its recovery and reasons for disapearance than any of the murders. I didn't even notice that anyone had died. I appears that Ms. Cannell either wrote this as a first novel or she must have been in a horrible state of some kind when she did write it. I'm happy to see an addition to the Haskell series in ""The Spring Cleaning Murders"" and can't wait to read it. God Save Dorothy Cannell!!This was not a pleasant read and it would have been better in the Cannel sytle of First Person writing."
4,Fine for a very light read---,A fun light mystery with just a whisper of romance that did became a bit too silly at times.
3,Not as thrilled as with the Ellie Haskell stories!!,"To tell the truth, I was disappointed in this book. I thought the story line was great, but the developement of the story wasn't as good as it could have been. I look forward to reading Dorothy's books! But this one didn't meet my expectations."
5,Sound Quality is Excellent!,"I like this CD because I like to listen to it and think about how simple life must have been in the mid-50's... I was too young to experience Frank firsthand, but I can appreciate the clean purity and honesty of this music. Plus, somehow the sound on this CD is great! I don't know whether the original master recordings were better than average, or somebody intelligent really took their time with the Re-mastering, but Sinatra's voice is really clear and just jumps out like he's in the room with you! And that makes some of this 45 yr old songs very listenable! I especially like 'I've got the world on a String'. Now on to Dean Martin!"
5,You can't go wrong!,"If you're not sure which Sinatra CD to buy first, this is a great place to start. He really did get his style buffed to a high polish in the 50s, with a perfect balance of swing and romance. This collection highlights the best. I love the craft in the lyrics of songs like ""Witchcraft,"" ""How Little We Know"" and ""The Tender Trap""; the sheer enjoyment of ""Learning the Blues""; the great build-up in the arrangement and performance of ""I've Got You Under My Skin."" I can't find a way to say it that isn't cliched: Frank Sinatra was a master. Just listen and see if you're not knocked off your feet. If you get as hooked as I am, you may eventually end up with all these tracks on other albums and collections, but you'll never regret this introduction."
5,Frank is the BEST!,"These Capitol recordings are the tip of an iceberg of fantastic Frank releases from his 1950's(mostly) output.These years were considered to be his peak years by many fans. The concept Lp's that spawned these wonderful recordings are fortunately availiable in ""The Capitol Years"" box set, and ""Concepts"". They are so expensive, and so extensive that this compilation serves as an excellent overview of mood, swing, and style from Hoboken's own!You will recognize most of the signiture recordings here. I own all the sets, but this one is with me in the car! If you only buy one Sinatra cd this is a good choice!"
3,Our first Digital Camera,"We were given this camera for free with our new computer. It is the first experience we've had with a digital camera. The pictures are a little blurry and grainy, but, what did we expect for free? We had no trouble with the uploads at all. The camera was up and running in a matter of seconds. I particularly like the export feature, which allows you to put your pictures into e-mail and other projects. It is, I believe, a very good camera for a young girl to learn multimedia savvy.Editing is easy. It is a lot of fun."
1,Waste of money,"This camera was a big waste of money. Like the test families and one other reviewer, we were never able to view pictures on our 6 month old Dell computer. The camera now sits in a toybox and is used infrequently as a ""pretend"" camera. I suggest buying your child a refurbished or used digital camera instead of wasting your money on the barbie version."
2,"Good camera, poor resolution","The appearance of this camera will appeal to girls (it did to my daughter) but the resolution is so poor you can't get a good picture. For girls the image editor will let them put what looks like them into a picture with Barbie, and they will find that fun..."
5,Kids Shenanigans,"This book is great for kids ages 6 and up. It includes many different facts that all kids would just die to know. When I bought myself a copy I went wild reading all the funny facts and stunts. Did you know that you can read in the dark and it won't hurt your eyes? Well that's just one of the many facts you'll find in this book. Next time your mom says ""turn a light on when you read"" just go and show her your copy of ""Kids Shenanigans"". Kids of all ages get ready to go into the Klutz universe and go wild"
3,Shenanigans,I bought this as a gift for my Autistic nephew who asked only for a Whoopie Cushion for his present. He was sooo excited when I told him what he asked for would arrive in the mail. I had it sent directly to him and was extremely disappointed to hear that it arrived WITHOUT the whoopie cushion. What a pity...
4,The last section was worth the $27.95 price,"I agree with the reviewer who wrote:""The last section, which I found to be the most useful, are progression exercises. Although the author still refers the reader to the Grimoire Chords and Voicings book for all varieties of possible positions for each chords, the voice leading combinations presented here are excellent. In the words of the author, this section is practice for fingers, mind, and ear."" Much of the rest of the book seemed off the subject."
2,Not very good,There are much better books out there than this one. Guitar Aerobics being my favourite. I would not recommend this and it is the best of the Grimoire series!
3,erratic,Fount this to be tempermental as the function knob has an issue with is still using it but have to watch while using
3,CC from Los Angeles,I still don't like the battery life. No body can give a comparison about this sony's battery with the other cameras like Canon etc. Like how many pictures it can take with flash light on before it needs charge.
1,"My older, less expensive camera works much better!","From the moment I got this camera, I hated it! The photos mostly come out blurry. Every so often I may get a clear photo but that's few and far between! It automatically shuts off (to save battery life) but way to soon. Turning it back on takes up those precious seconds to get that great shot. I'm not sure if I just don't understand how to use the camera, even though I've read the instructions, or if it's the camera itself. Either way, my old HP worked much better than this camera! Don't waste your money."
2,Big LCD screen but soft & fuzzy pictures,My Canon S400 took 10x better crispy clear pictures than this Sony 5MP. Very disappointing. Don't get too excited about all the five stars review until you try one yourself and compare pictures with other cameras.
1,Focusing problems,"I am very disappointed with this camera. I purchased it to replace my 3 year old 2.1 meg Olympus. The color is better on the Sony, but I'm encountering SERIOUS focusing problems. No matter how I set the camera, it just seems like dumb luck whether my kids' faces will be in focus. More often than not, they are not. This is my first and last Sony camera."
1,Disappointed,"At first the camera worked great. It broke within 6 months. Fortunately, the warrenty paided for the repair the first time - but it took 2 months! It was sent back to me still broken the first time. At 13 months, right after the 1 year warrenty expired, the LCD screen went out. What's the point of owning a digital camera if you can't see the photo? The cover for the batteries is also failing and the shutter no longer closes."
1,Plagued with mechanical problems.,Loved the camera at first. But then I noticed that the problems listed below were also the problems many other owners on the internet were having.1. Battery door tabs break. Must buy entire compartment from Sony.2. Lens won't retract.3. Dust specs on the inner lens (inside camera housing). Repair manual will cost money if requested from Sony.4. Movie-mode will continually go in and out of focus even if aimed at stationary object while on tri-pod.Get a service plan cause you'll be sending this guy off within a year.
2,SAME PROBLEM THAN LAST REVIEWER,"Exactly the same happened to me. After less than 2 years of use, the lens mechanism broke and had to pay around $200 for repair. After that repair, the batteries lasts enough for 5 or 6 pictures then goes dead, no matter how charged they are. To make it worst, now the flash is dead and there is no available replacements for it, so pretty much it is garbage now.Otherwise, before it broke the pictures were pretty good, but honestly I prefer the quality and colors of my 2 megapixels Olympus.I will never buy a Sony camera again, this was a terrible experience, I will try a Canon now."
4,Extremely Satisfied,"It took me a long time to buy a digital camera. I always agonize over spending this much money and fear that it won't live up to my expectations. I've had the camera for about two months and so far I am thrilled. I've used a number of the features and tried shooting with the 3 and 5 megapixel setting. Great shots! The large LCD is very nice and clear. Even the battery life is longer then expected, although I bought an extra set of batteries for $8.99 at the Sony website. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was I'm sure it's not perfect and just haven't come across as to why just yet."
1,I wanted to LOVE this camera BUT...,"I wanted to love this camera, but it was not to be. I researched for about a month and was sold on all of it's features; 5.1 mega pixels, 2.5"" LCD, loads of manuel controls and effects and the ability to attach telephoto and wide angle lens and filters. One problem, every picture I took over the course of 3 days was VERY soft/fuzzy. I tried adjusting all the manuel settings, nothing, just fuzzy pictures. I even did a picture for picture comparison with my old 2.0 megapixel Canon s100 and the Canon was sharper . I took the camera back and got a Canon Powershot A80, loads of features, attachable lens,$100 bucks less...GREAT pictures. One last thing, be careful who you buy from, I purchased from a company that likes to say their a 'best buy', and had a nightmarish time trying to return the sony, good luck!"
1,Great camera; But not built to last,"This camera will take amazing pictures, and the 2.5 inch LCD is quite impressive.However, I definately would not buy it again.After 13 months of having the dscw1, it malfunctioned beyond personal repair, and Sony customer service is a joke.The warrenty ran out a month ago. And sony wants $171 to fix a camera that I paid $350 for.I am quite upset with the situation, but there's not much that I can do. Just take my advice, and go don't buy this camera; it was not meant to last."
2,"Good pictures, lousy software","I just bought this camera a week ago and it takes excellent pictures (not good for sports or action shots). The problem I have is the movie mode. It's great for being compact and taking short little clips. Unfortunately, it's only compatible with the software that Sony includes. I can't burn to DVD or create a memento CD with editing or music. Which is what the salesperson told me I could do."
2,Maybe not for moms with young children!,I've had my camera for almost and year and I will admit I have not even looked at the manual. My husband encouraged me to buy this camera because he was issued one by his employer and we could share information and some things like memory sticks etc.My biggest gripe about the camera is the delay in taking some pictures. It's mostly an indoor problem. In low lighting situations it has over a 4 second delay. With three year olds that's too long! I miss my shot almost 70% of the time! Sometimes it takes so long I'll move the camera to see if it's on or in the right selection and then the camera goes off taking a blurred picture of the ceiling. Other people who have used my camera had the same problem.I can't make comments about the picture quality because I'm really behind in printing my pictures.
2,"cool tool, shoddy product, lousy support","I purchased this as a x-mas gift for my busband. We both thought it was pretty cool and useful. . BUT within 6 months the remote sensor stopped working (it was telling us that it was 138 degrees F). Silly me I figured that something at this price point would still be covered under warantee. Not so. OSI is saying we need to buy another remote sensor. IF we do purchase it, then it will be the last things we ever buy of OSI products.My suggestion. . save your money or buy someone else's!"
1,Worked Once,I tried more than 20 times to get the lock to secure but only got it to work once. When I needed it to work I could not get it to lock. I literally was so mad at it I threw it into the trash. It wasn't worth the return shipping costs.
5,Perfect for the Golf Cart,"I park my Golf Cart in a near-by carport. I realized it was an 'easy target' and I needed some theft protection. After going to several auto stores and finding nothing that would work, I tried an on-line search. I found the ""Dr. Hook"" (pedal to steering wheel) product, it looked like it would work for a golf cart and was surprised the price was so reasonable. I ordered it and now I am a very satisifed customer and recommend it to my golf buddies."
2,Thieves would just cut the steering wheel,"I don't think this device is very secure.Like the original club, the thieves would just cut the part of the steering wheel where this device is hooked on and remove this device easily."
1,Too Short to Use.,"The idea is great, but the item is not long enough to actually reach from the brake pedal to the steering wheel. The two pieces just barely meet so that the lock does not engage. I ask someone else to try their hand at it, they were not able to attach it either. It's too bad because the item is very sturdy and would be ideal if it were long enough."
1,Portnoy's Complaint,"I cant believe I payed for this book! I am not a prude, but I sure could not find any reason for the raunchy sexual writing in this book. I can write a book this good. Would not recommened this book to anyone."
4,amusing,"This is one long Richard Lewis stand-up routine--amusing, but not nearly as funny as ""The Great American Novel"".Also recommended: PENTATONIC SCALES FOR THE JAZZ-ROCK KEYBOARDIST by JEFF BURNS."
4,"""Good Boy""","Certainly no complaint in the literary saviore faire of Roth. Alexander Portnoy recounts his sexuality from an immature, devilish child's mind to a cunning, sinister's grown-up's ponderings. Roth is relentless in his satire and beautifully paints a common picture between appetite and morality. The start of the book is akin to a cold engine on a Midwestern January morning- slow to get going. But as soon as you are in gear, Alexander Portnoy reveals his aberrant desire captured by his tortured libido. As he grows older he is more cynical and Roth slightly overplays, but in the end nicely wraps it up and offers it as his present.We are lucky to be the recipients"
4,A Jewish Boy's Sexual Struggle,"This is a very funny account of a Jewish young man who is torn growing up between the ""good-boy"" mentality of his sheltered obsessive-compulsive family, and the strong sexual cravings of a [excited] teenager and (later) worldly man with lots of unfulfilled sexual desires and fantasies.In fact, ""Portnoy's Complaint"" is now a psychological term used to describe this struggle of repressed sexuality.But on a broader scale, this book is also many other things, among them: a fair (and true) indictment of Jewish life, insecurities, and self-pity; the hilarity of ""American Pie""; and every possible thing Freud could ever think of! Enjoy."
4,I'll never think of apples the same way again.,"""Portnoy's Complaint"" is definitely a . . . unique book. It was recommended to me by a friend, a friend I now consider completely off his gourd. The premise of the book is very interesting, albiet a little hard to follow. Alexander Portnoy is a Jew, growing up in America with an especially nagging mother and a (literally) anal-retentive father. He recounts his life with his mother and his sexual revolution/revelation and interweaves them in a fantasically funny and tougue-in-cheek monologue.The beginning of the book is definitely the best, though Roth loses a little momentum. The book is very engaging as a whole, but by the end I was wondering where the ranting stopped and the hilarity begain again. Roth's afterword puts a personal spin on things, and helps tie it all together. All in all, better than the trash being printed today, but not quite up to masterpiece standards."
2,Maybe I missed something.,"I picked up Portnoy's Complaint expecting that it would not disappoint. More than one reader whom I respect a great deal told me that I should not neglect Portnoy's Complaint in my quest to understand how highly Roth is regarded in the literary world. For the most part, I loved Roth's American Pastoral. Save for one passage that made me laugh out loud and one passage about a neighborhood softball game, Portnoy's Complaint was a 287-page rant (I defy you to shuffle through the book randomly and find a page that isn't peppered with exclamation marks) that I suppose carried a great deal of shock value when it was published in the late sixties. Roth's Afterword is immensely more interesting than the novel."
4,hysterical stream-of-conciousness,"I found this book to be utterly hysterical, particularly the section entitled ""Whacking Off"". Yet for all the humour, it rang true in it's depicition of the guilt and worrying inherent in growing up Jewish. A clever, witty unabashed stream-of-conciousness narrative."
2,I got little out of it,"I had been wanting to read this for years and finally got around to it.I guess it was pretty shocking at the time, but by this point I found it disorganized and forgettable.Perhaps it was groundbreaking in its day: a frank book like this hadn't appeared in serious American literature until then.But these days, it's basically like hearing the dark fantasies of George Costanza -- except without the humor."
2,Mediocre,"The kindest thing I can think to say about this book is that I suppose at the cusp of the sexual revolution it may have been startling and fresh and witty. But outside of that narrow zone of reference, ""Portnoy's Complaint"" is fatally shrill, a hard, thin mat on which to lie. The streaky ""humor"" of the book - and here is where it severely disappoints - is conceived entirely in the author's imagination of self, and wholly for his benefit, not ours. The great lesson I learned from this novel is the inescapable danger writers wade into when they affix self-deprecation to vainglory. And is there anything more tedious than listening to someone talk about themselves for hours on end?"
3,1960s classic,"A classic book from the sixties, gives an insight to the over protective Jewish parents of the time and the rebellion against the over bearing expectations. When reading you must understand the shock value it had in the 60s with its graphic sexual content. A product of its time but still worth the read"
5,Another hilarious Roth read.,"This story, about a Jewish man struggling with his identity, relationships, and lifelong conflicts with his parents,(much of the dialogue is a one sided conversation to his psychiatrist) has the same stunning Roth dry wit, insight, sexuality, relationship conflict & fascinating character development I've grown to expect from his work.This has been my least favorite of the 4 I've read so far because it dwells so heavily on, is so saturated with his ranting complaints about his parents. Much of it is hilarious...but it was just repetitive enough to get a little old and keep me from savoring the read fully.I'm giving it 5 stars nevertheless because ""Portnoy's Complaint"" = complaining (right?), and it's still a fabulous read with Alexander Portnoy doing his fair share of the complaining."
3,"Lewd, Crude and Dangerous to Know","This is probably the most disgusting book I've ever read. I'm not prudish or easily shocked by what I read, but this was certainly difficult to take. I did persevere and got to the end (which is cleverly done), and some of it is very funny, but I didn't really enjoy it enough. I suppose the problem was: a) I'm not Jewish, b) I've never had a Jewish mother. The book is still funny without those advantages (we can all empathise after all) but I don't think you'll like it as much if you don't fulfill the two above categories."
1,Unhappy about kindle pricing,"I added this book to my cart for $9.99, but was informed on checkout that the price was different for ""my"" country ($3 more). Although I am a US resident using a US credit card and a US address, I currently am in Japan so I suppose that's what Amazon detects as ""my"" country. I find this practice unacceptable and will suspend shopping on The Kindle store until I get a satisfactory explanation. After all, a majority of the greatest books ever written is available for free..."
2,"BORING,FLAT AND NOT AT ALL FUNNY","Roth's style remindes me of occasions where people speak out loud to themselves when they are angry with a situation.It was very tiring for me to read a book thats written enntirely in this style.the impression you get is that this guy is hitting his head with a hammer to get ideas to fill the pages of this book instead of visiting a psychiatric and talk about his childhood.all those details about Jew families,thousands of horrible lines about sex that are supposed to be funny....writting diaries not for publication would be better for this writer.it was his only book i read and i dont intent to read more"
1,unforgivable,"Yah, it's bad. I've started and stopped 3 books in my life. I started and stopped 3 times so I could finish this.First, Roth is a bum. No good. History will vindicate that statement. Second, it was not funny at all. Maybe 934 years ago this stuff was 'crazy' (strange, though, how everyone says it was a sex-crazed euphoric utopia, those 60s, yet this was ribald then?).Guess what? There is a punchline at the end that is stupid, like he's talking to himself the whole time. BRILLIANT! No wonder it's Roths best known work.The dad has trouble taking a dump. HILARIOUS! The mom is a typical jewish housewife/mother. REVELATIONARY!Just shut up, please. If you are thinking of buying or reading this read 'Confederacy of Dunces,' and if you've read that read it again. This was a bestseller how? Roth is good why?Kevin's Complaint: Roth is an oversexed old man who had issues when he was young and isn't worth a kick in the review."
1,Philip Roth: Misogynist and Self-Loathing Jew,"As a Jewish female, I could feel the bitterness crackle every time I turned the page. Roth obviously loathes his religion and loathes women as well. I'm not surprised at all that he had such a messy divorce from Claire Bloom, an attitude like his would leave me running for cover. As for the book, it was not at all funny. It is the ranting of a small, petty man. Apparently, I am in a minority with this opinion. Well, it's time people saw Philip Roth as he really is."
2,Over-sexed,"This book starts out kind of interesting, but then you really begin to see why the title includes the word ""complaint."" It really is just one big, long complaint. Much of this complaining has to do with sex. It's really overdone in the sex department."
4,"Great, if a bit overrated","This book contains some of the funniest moments in literature (that I have read, anyhow). Roth's characters are well drawn, and Portnoy's annecdotes are quite amusing. Still, like most Roth I've read, this book gets a bit repetitive. Ok Alex, we get it, your parents were nuts, you hate yourself as a jew, you can't have healthy relationships with women, and you're self-obsessed.The repetition doesn't get too much in the way though, since the book is such a quick read, so it's worth it."
4,Oldie but Goodie,Just reread this book after thirty years and it still was a fun read that captured my imagination. Kudos to Phillip Roth that the story could hold up after so much time.
5,now Woody Allen movies make more sense,"This book is one long hilarious rage filled rant about family, culture, the purpose of life and the impossible pursuit of happiness. Simultaneously raging against society's constructs and judging himself harshly against them, the character of Alex Portney resonates in a way that Holden Caulfield, who was too whiny and apathetic for my taste, never did for me. The brutally honest portayal of the conflict between how he intellectually knows he ""should"" be against how his primal instincts and desires drive him to be is extremely relevant for men in this day and age."
1,Pic not actual sz -Print covers only 24 x 60 of the 36 x 72 felt,Don't buy this product if you are looking for a FULL SIZED Craps Game Felt (as it is marketed). Actual size of the Craps game print covers only 24 x 60 of the 36 x 72 felt. Picture on Amazon page shows print covering entire felt size incorrectly. I wanted a FULL-SIZED Craps Game Felt and expected the print to cover the entire 36 x 72 inches of felt especially because of how it was pictured. I returned this product.
2,Blank on One Side,"This item is called a ""Poker Craps Layout"", but it only has Craps. The other side is blank. I'm not sure if this is what is intended."
4,You get what you pay for,"This layout was super cheap, and not of the finest quality.Mine has one real flaw, one of the printed letters had a penny-size piece of fuzz/fabric underneath it when it was steamed onto the felt. So in essence, half of the letter was printed onto a piece of fuzz that ripped right off, now I'm missing a portion of one of the letters. Not too big of a deal.Considering the price, I knew what I was getting into.The printing everywhere else is crisp and clean. I hope it doesn't wear out too quickly. If it does, then I can flip it over and simply have a 3x6ft felt cover to staple down onto a table for cards.For a cheap layout, this one really can't be beat for price or quality."
5,Trademark Poker Craps Layout,Good quality. The layout was the exact size needed to cover the air hockey table where we played. We have had a great time using the layout
4,Excellen!,"Good quality material and great size, but missing some of the bets ofen found in Vegas, such as C&E. Overall, highly rated."
4,Decent quality for the money,"As others have noted, the painted area only covers a 24"" x 60"", but THAT'S OK, because on an actual casino craps table, the layout does NOT extend all the way to the sides. This is just about the perfect size for home use. Plenty of room for multiple players bets. My only complaint, which is reflected in other's reviews, is that I'm going to have to steam the creases out of it before I start using it. I wish it'd been rolled up and put in a tube vs. folding it up as it is now. I'll be using this for ""game nights"" at home and as a teaching aid."
4,Craps Table layout,"This layout can't be beat for the price. I built a 3ft x 6ft table for my basement and this piece really helped finish it off. Yes, the felt is not super thick, but I just lined my table with some felt from Wal-Mart and laid this on top. I figure if it starts to wear out, I can just replace it."
1,Not as advertised,"Don't get fooled! They claim the size is 36"" X 72"", but the actual size is 24 X 48"". It was a miniaturized version."
3,acceptable for playing with friends at home,"I bought this to host a casino night with friends at home. You do get what you pay for in this case. The felt is decent quality, so no complaints there. The screenprinting is not them most uniform. Some parts are heavier than others, other spots are not printed at as high a quality as I would like. It comes folded up, and the folds are very difficult to remove. It would have been nice if it had come in a roll rather than folded. Be sure that you steam it and hang it for SERVERAL days before use. I had to use a cool iron and some of the folds still did not come out. Just be careful not to melt it. If what you want is a simple layout to have a fun night with friends without spending a ton of money, this is a good option."
2,Book Annoying,"I wasn't mad at anyone, but the angel wasn't good. He was so downbeat and sparkling. ROAR. Habila's better write ""Doctor Ice Cream,"" a masterpiece, before I forgive him."
3,"""SPAIN"" Spanish","I think it's important to note that this toy is in Spanish, but in proper Spanish from Spain. Many of the animals' names differ from more common Latin American names. Another more minor issue I have with this toy is the male voice that announces the names and instructions. It's very monotone and not ""fun"" to listen to."
5,good toy - my son hasn't tired of it after a year.,"We purchased this for our son Christmas 2004 -- he was 18 months old then. He loved it right away and played with it EVERY DAY for 6 months. Travels kept him away from it over the summer, but since then, he still plays with it often, and has now mastered three of the (four) levels of games, in which the user listens to increasingly complex instructions and responds by finding an item or items. And now our daghter, soon to a be a year old, enjoys pressing the buttons and listening to the songs (which still inspire adorable little dances by her big brother).The bilingual feature is great (we have it in German/English). Our son mastered 1 - 10 in both languages quickly, thanks to this toy. But don't tell him he was learning; to him it was just fun."
2,entertain me junk,"This is a bells and whistles toy, that is totally worthless without its batteries. While it does have the redeeming factor of a bilingual presentation of animals and numbers, it is a big dud. The kids do like it, and push the buttons, but they mostly use the button for lights and music. If you want to train your child into an entertainment junkie with a very short attention span, this toy would be a good start. But then that is my opinion on most battery operated toys."
1,Disappointed,"I really like the delfonics and I was excited to get their live performance DVD. I received and played my DVD today. The singing was lousy. In fact, it was horrible. It was so bad until I was unable to watch the entire DVD.As you can imagine, I was very disappointed and would like to advise everyone to SAVE YOUR MONEY. If the DVD were free, it still would not be worth watching. I truly believe I could have done a better job singing/performing with Alvin and the chipmunks as my backup singers. If I could rate this a zero I would.This is truly a group that sounds much better on CD."
1,A Waste,This DVD is awful. The sound is terrible. Not sure whether its the performers or the sound quality of the recording. I was very disappointed. My copy is going into the garbage immediately.
1,Very unhappy,"We own many dvd's and I must say this is the worst I've ever seen. As a matter of fact, it wasn't even worth watching the whole thing. There is only one original group member left, which he wasn't that bad, but his side kicks were horrible and out of tune most of the time. They were even doing songs that weren't Delfonic songs. Thumbs down all the way."
2,very bad,"i think its time to call it quits for the delfonics,i love their music but this dvd is terrible,the twins are horrible,they cant sing poogie is shot,please save your money on this one"
3,the defonics still doing there thing,this is another old school concert that you must see it's very entertaining very relaxing to watch when you with that special someone.
4,Pretty good,"I didn't think it was so bad,i like the second concert a little better.I know they are older and it's not going to sound the same as back in the day but it was a nice concert.It was nice to add DAVID RUFFIN brother to the group."
3,FM Tonight is a good album,"Tonight sounds good, and has some great 80's pop songs, especially ""Dream girl"" and ""Just like you"".It's the same divisions, prog vs. pop a la Yes ""Big Generator"". These people ignore that it might be better pop than a lot of others."
1,WHAT IN THE WORLD HAPPENED?,I LOVED THIS GROUPS MUSIC UP TO AND INCLUDING CITY OF FEAR. BUT THEN THEY GOT RICK OKASEK FEVER AND RELEASED THIS ABSOLUTE HEAP OF GARBAGE. SOUNDS LIKE A POOR MAN'S CARS...THIS MAKES TRAILOR TRASH LOOK GREAT...THIS IS ABOUT AS BAD AS IT GETS...SEE PHIL COLLIN'S SOLO ALBUMS...NEOPROG RAN WEPT FOR DAYS WHEN HE HEARD THIS..WHAT IN THE WORLD HAPPENED? NASH THE TRASH
1,Is this for real?,"""Tonight"" is not only a bad ""FM"" CD, it's one of the worst album I have ever heard!They even tried Beach Boys' ""Good Vibration"". Maybe that was FM's sense of humor?This is a very bad mixture of AOR-pop-rock-prog-DISCO.Buy it, and have a good laugh......"
3,The simple beauty of Tuscany&#65533;a bit too commercialized,"This beautifully photographed book attempts to capture the simple elegance of Tuscan cooking. The dishes and flavor combinations are authentic, but it is often too commercial in its reference to Five Brothers pasta sauce. My exprience with this brand of jarred sauce is that it doesn't deliver the freshest Italian taste. However, if you substitute homemade sauce or gourmet brands (Classico, Sutter Home, etc.) in the recipes you'll get excellent results.Buon appetito!"
2,Don't buy this one,"I purchased one of these from Radio Shack a year ago. This time I bought it from Amazon. Stay away from this brand name (Lenmar). They do not hold a charge well, not for more than 5 days. I ordered a no-name off-shore battery from a cell phone supply website, and it out performs the Lenmar. Look for this: replacement for RX37xx, 3.7vdc=1500mAh. The voltage is not stock but it will work better."
3,mediocre,"While I enjoyed this book, I found it clumsy at times. In the first half, the two main characters have very little interaction with each other on-screen, which sometimes made it feel like nothing was really happening. Also, the story had a common problem of historical romances in which the characters are thoroughly (almost stereotypically) modern and don't fit their historical context. Both heroine and her love interest seemed a bit too uptight to be true, in their own ways (not sexually, though, the sex was all right). There were some small but jarring anachronisms in the setting, too. Otherwise, it was kind of a fun book."
3,An average read,"I liked the setting of the book and Joseph was a refreshingly diffrent hero. I however had problems with Marie Laure's characterisation and her quest for freedom and independence towards the end.I also dont like novels where the hero and heroine are separated for a long period of time, and in this book they did not have any scenes together for almost a hundred pages in between! Hence the three stars."
5,"Engrossing, couldn't put it down!","I didn't have high hopes for this book but I couldn't put it down! A great read, with nice historical details thrown in."
2,A Bit Ridiculous and Clich√©,"I was sorely disappointed...I'm not sure what I expected...something believable perhaps. Unfortunately this novel reads like a sexually explicit episode of The Young and the Restless.The characters are flat, the clich√©s are many and the murder mystery portion of the novel seems like a complete after thought. I have to admit that Rosenthal did a nice job with the backdrop, France 1783-1789.But this story was overly focused on the explicit sex scenes between the main characters and falls flat with nearly every other aspect of the storytelling."
1,Yuck,"I read her first book *Almost a Gentleman* and liked it..The story was fun and different, but as soon as the sex comes into the book, it just goes downhill for me.This book was exactly the same way. Pam Rosenthal is gifted; I just do not know why her books become so nasty, and sexual.. and unromantic.. half way through them.This is truly, what people call a trashy romance. I just do not like them. I love sex in my books, but when it gets so descriptive and the words become porn and not romantic. It just turns me off. I threw this away in the trash half way in the book.I do love the exotic, and Pam Rosenthal is truly exotic. I just do not like trashy. Take the F words out and every position known to have sex in and there is no story anymore. It starts out wonderful and just come to a complete halt.. When the sex starts."
3,Better case than mounting system...,"This makes a good case and has lots of room but I already bought a mount for the seatback, to replace this, that holds it steadier and works much better. The DVD player would shake too much even when secured tightly and the whole ""between the seats"" thing was a pain as the DVD player was in the way for access between the seats."
3,Ok product,I wouldn't have bought this item if I saw it first...too little and not enough storage space..not convient to use in back seat either....I have made the best of it since it was such a low price....
5,Outstanding!,"I've used Cakewalk, Voyetra, Finale, and virtualy every other music publishing program and this is the first one that I can say is worth every penny. The functionality, convinience and versatility of this program goes unmatched and the look of your scores in the end is so good that people will swear you were published by Hal Lenard! If you're a student who hopes to make composition your future, invest in this program. If you're an established composer who is using some other program, dump them and move to Sibelius. I've only had my copy for two days and I'm a devoted consumer."
4,Tight Budget???,"My father got this for Christmas last year. Let me start out by saying that it's an extremely sturdy piece of equipment. The digits are large, so you can see the temperature and the time from a good distance away. Also, it's amazingly accurate! However, all it does is give you the current temperature, the min/max temperature, and a (usually WRONG) forecast icon. It doesn't show you barometric pressure trends or the humidity. Barometric pressure is only important if your trying to predict the weather, but humidity is very useful. Conclusion: it's great for what it does, but a []cheaper model could do everything it does, except for recieving the signal from Atomic Clock in CO! Personally, I'm going with a []model from La Crosse Technology that gives you barometric pressure trends, storm warnings, snow alerts, humidity readings, memory for all of it, and a more accurate forecast. If you're interested, it's model WS-9018U."
3,Barometer doesn't work at high altitude,"I purchased this product only to find outthat the pressure sensor in this device onlygoes to 795 mb. So, if you live at or aboveabout 6000 ft none of the pressure related measurements willwork. This limitation should be more presented clearlyalong with the other specs. for this device."
2,Clearly a return,"I received what was clearly a piece of returned merchandise. There were no instructions in the box, the box was worn as if it had been opened multiple times and the batteries were already installed, and dead, in the base unit. Since I live in a rural location I opted to give it a try and fresh batteries seem to see it working OK. We'll see if the date/time updates before I decide to keep it. Fortunately the controls are fairly intuitive but a lack of instructions is a dissapointment."
1,overview,"I purchased this product several years ago with 2 remote sensors. While one works fine, the second will not transmit and efforts to contact Oregon have been unseccesful."
4,Rosina Lippi and Sara Donati,"I loved Sara Donati's ""Into the Wilderness"" series so wanted to read her as Rosina Lippi. I enjoyed both ""Tied to the Tracks"" and ""The Pajama Girls of Lambert Square"" very much, too. Can't wait for MORE!"
4,A little misdirection and a lot of fun,"Ms Lippi has a fun sense of humor and a unique perspective on what drives people. She takes the psychological underpinnings of average neurotics and weaves them into situations that are just barely believable. Then she writes it all well enough that you end up believing. Bad things happen, good things happen, unexpected things happen. Through it all, she has a lovely touch of humor and of the ridiculous. I really enjoyed this book, though not as much as I liked Lippi's The Pajama Girls of Lambert Square."
3,NOT one of the best by Agatha Christie!,Curtain was a good book but not the best by Agatha Christie. I would have given it 2 stars if it wasn't for the excellent last chapter. It kept dragging along through the whole stories. I would still recommend this book to be read becuase it is Hercule Poriots last case.
5,for Hercule votaries,this book absolutely deserves 5 stars.every page of it is fabulous.this is worth praising too much for a crime fiction votaries.
4,Believe it or not; this is my FIRST Agatha Christie novel...,"It's the 42nd and LAST of the Hercule Poirot cases! Needless to say, I simply must endeavor to read them all!I was dazed and confused at first, but got into the swing of the story and was soon captivated! The ending was a total and complete surprise! HP is a champion deceiver! But can he even fool his best ""sleuth"" friend, Captain Hastings? All evidence seems to point to someone close to Captain Hasting's... who would turn out to be the killer? I was so surprised! Excellent; highly recommended"
4,"Poirot, Shakespeare, and Overtones of Freud","Poirot's last case is a memorable one. As always, details are important and attention must be paid. What makes this one special is that characterizations, Shakespeare's Othello, and Freud's belief in the extensive dark side of every human personality play an equally important role. ""Curtain"" is psychological and literary as well as mysterious.A few nits can be picked: the villain's personality might have been fleshed out in more detail, one or two clues may be of borderline fairness. But if you like psychology as well as mystery, this one should be right up your alley."
3,"Disappointing ending, disappointing end","Wow. Having read several Agatha Christie books, including many with Hercule Poirot, I was really disappointed in this one. Not only is it clear from the start that this is his last case, it is clearly shocking (in a disappointing way) how it ends. I agree with the reviewers who say it ends with Hercule Poirot totally out of character and acting in a way that negates all the previous books. And it turns out the ""murderer"" is someone who is not really a murderer, but a manipulator. The expounder Poirot gives at how he arrived at his solution seems really far-fetched. This is the only one of Christie's novels that I have read so far that I have not really cared for."
3,Mediocre,"This is about a painter who fakes his death and the things that happen as a result. It's OK, nothing special about it. The ending just fizzles out- some kind of a surprise would have been nice. It's short and doesn't take long to read."
2,miss saigon and les miserables,i was very impress of lea salonga she has a woderfull voice the original miss saigon is always the best and thats lea salonga with an angelic voice and beautiful baby face
5,Wonderful music for all fans of Sondheim and Lloyd Weber !,"Hey Mr. Producer! is a must for all fans of musical theater around the world! This outstanding production was featured on PBS within the month of August and September in a limited form. The CD has all of the music from the evening's tribute to the shows of Cameron MacIntosh. The music from My Fair Lady, Little Shop of Horrors, Les Miseables, Cats, Martin Guerre,Side By Side, and the list goes on and on, sung my the legends of American and British theater. Can't recommend it enough!"
4,"Great Music, Great Performances.","I think that this CD is fabulous, and I listen to it quite often. However, because of time constraints, some of the songs are somewhat abriged from their original forms. The performers are wonderful, including many notable names such as Bernadette Peters and Lea Salonga."
1,I can't think of a worse way to spend $1.99,"I could have made a better video on my iPhone 3G. Seriously, I've seen some awful movies but this takes the cake. I hesitate to even call this thing a movie. If you rent this, you will be sorry."
3,Good for secular reference,"From the viewpoint of a Buddhist practitioner, some of the entries were disappointing. For example, the entries for Ksitigarbha and Kuan Yin were not as good as the entries in Shambala Dictionary. Oxford is obviously more updated and includes terms that Shambala doesn't. This is the only advantage it has over the Shambala dictionary (I'd love to see how Shambala would present them). If you're looking for secular reference information the Oxford dictionary is suitable. If you're looking for non-secular information that is commonly agreed upon by most Buddhist practitioners, Shambala is a better choice."
1,A Complete waste of time!,"I really like western movies but this one is absolutely tiresome. There's no story here, no acting, no directional touches. The cast is completely lost in a series of scenes that made no sense at all (like the shooting in a cave when Joshua killed the last outlaw. There's no dialogue here, too.Williamson gives a zombie-like performance all the time and that contributes to make this misfire a complete waste of time and a great exercise of patience."
2,Disappointing.,"I was looking for a concise, yet interesting, book about the Declaration of Independence. The book provides a simplified accounting of the times preceding the writing of the document. Though the vocabulary is age-appropriate and the information factual, the style is uninteresting, and the book gives none of the fascinating details that could bring the period and the event to life."
2,Yo ho ho and a few yawns,"'The Smugglers' was the penultimate adventure of the first (William Hartnell) Doctor, and is here adapted by Terrance Dicks. The adaptation and the story are very straightforward and uninspiring.The TARDIS arrives in 17th Century Cornwall, and the Doctor has to convince new companions Ben and Polly that they have travelled. (They can accept the TARDIS is bigger on the inside, but not travelling in time?) They become caught up with some pirates, who are searching for buried treasure.Probably this story would have benefited from a less traditional adaptation. It tells the story well enough, but lacks any real spark. It also fails in the original mission for Doctor Who historicals, which was to educate the viewers. It is not truly an historical story, more of a period piece.For Doctor Who enthusiasts only."
4,fun christmas gift,"My husband had been joking that he wanted a clock he could see(without glasses)in the middle of a sleepless night, and voila!!!It projects large enough even for those who regularly need glasses to see. And you can project immediately above you on the ceiling. Very good product, does just what it says. A bonus is that it automatically sets itself to the ""atomic clock"" and is always right!!! He still gets a kick out of it. Finally a useful gift that is fun too."
5,Great Projection Alarm Clock!,"I have had my unit for years and have just purchased another for a friend. It is easy to use, the projector works wonderfully (the red numbers are nice at night, not glaring and doesn't reduce night vision), the ascending alarm is a useful feature, and it is stylish (not to mention compact and easy to fit anywhere; and hard to knock-off places since it sports rubber bottom fittings). It works just as well as stated! Another nice feature is that the projection can be turned on or off with a roll of a switch, and the time can be projected (when not displayed) by touching the top button. Easy and nice. Overall, a lovely product!"
3,There are better choices out there for a keychain light.,"This is a good quality light. I've had mine on a keychain for a while. The best features are the sleek design and the leash. The design makes it fit well with keys on a keychain. I like to keep my keychain slim enough to fit into a jeans pocket,and this light allows that very well. The leash allows you to point the light where you are aiming your keys. Recently, however, I found a replacement. It is a garrity brand LED flashlight. It is a think rectangle design about the same size as a key. The light works well too. So the mag light is now on my car key, which works well for finding things in the trunk. For a flashlight to keep in the car, I'd advise the mag 2 AA flashlight."
3,hold on to your manual,"good clock, but hold on to your manual. no way to figure out how to set alarm time, etc. we lost ours, so I emailed to oregon scientific repeatedly. this was at least 9 months ago. never an answer. searched the internet too. no good. can't use the alarm. so I finally lost my patience and went shopping for another one. found one here and what do you know, there is a manual here. good clock, very complicated to set, no help from the maker."
4,Very Good Product for Price,"Pretty satisfied with this Alarm Clock, very light yet good quality, Practical & the Clock projection feature is great, was hoping projection could tilt to better position the clock display. But Overall, very happy with the purchase..."
3,"Oregon Scientific RM313PNA Self-Setting Projection Alarm Clock with Indoor Thermometer, Blue",it does what it says. the only complaint is the projection is a little blurred and you can't adjust it like you could on their other projection clocks.
3,Has their quality gone down?,"I bought a second one of these for the kids, after having great success with the one I already had. However, this one did not change over for daylight savings. When I reset it, I noticed that it was no longer in contact with the Atomic Clock. Calling Customer Service is a bit of a pain, as they will do everything possible to dissuade you from returning it. I was even told that I could set it manually from now on! Why would I purchase an atomic clock if I wanted to set it manually? They finally agreed to exchange it, since it was less than a year old, but I wonder what would have happened if it had failed me outside of a year. One expects a clock to last more than a year. Oh, and I'm still waiting for the replacement."
3,Good little clock,"Nice sized clock for a nightstand. That being said, I wish the display itself was backlit. The only way to see the time at night is to have the projection on the ceiling. If in a childs room that may prove to be a distraction that keeps them awake, watching the time. Fascination, thankfully, does not last long."
5,Great clock!,This clock is so much fun! I love the projecting feature - every time I wake up at night I just look up at the ceiling and the time is projected right there!!!!
1,So dim,"Not very bright!!!!! I also have a 6 lumen Inova Microlight and it's much, much brighter and smaller!! Good luck trying to find your way with this maglite."
4,only one problem,Automatically sets and updates time/day/date with U.S. Atomic Clock does not work for me in Washingotn DC.
1,Difficult to operate unless you like challenges,This alarm clock is nearly impossible to set. I took it into the store where we had purchased it and the sales staff could not figure it out. Not intuitive to operate. Great projection but the clock malfunctioned (projection stopped) and now lives in the recycle bin in the county dump. Don't waste your money.
1,Terrible Company,The clock is great. My son has one from Discovery Store and loves it and it does a lot of things well. I bought one for my nephew through this Amazon link and they never sent it. My inquiry generated an email that everyone in their company was fired for doing a bad job and we would get a credit!! Discovery's price is higher but it is still a good deal for $30 and at least you actually get the clock.
3,not the best projection clock,"The projection works well in the dark and at night. However, with any amount of light, you can not see the projection rendering it useless."
2,Not That Impressed,"The shipping was more than the price of the clock. Also, I live in Alaska & the clock is programmed to a time zone, it doesn't have an AK zone. I have to subract an hour when I look at the clock. Quite honestly, after paying the outrageous shipping fees I just decided to keep the clock and hope I move to one of the main US times zones some day and have the right time on my ceiling."
3,Good Light but will occasionally twist off on keychains,"The light is good, but will twist off from normal use on a keychain. In fact, my broke from falling on the ground. I will not buy this light again. Also a little heavy on the keychain."
1,Very Ugly and broke <1year.,Went to change the time. Fall back. Buttons didn't work. Had it less than a year. Don't know why they had to go R2D2 with the style. Only works in one specific spot and at one specific height (while it worked).
2,"Poor design, not reliable.","We've had this clock for a couple of years. The buttons stick out in the front, and a light accidental bump and your clock will change time zones or modes, and you won't wake up in the morning. I would not depend on this clock to wake you up. Also, the projector is on the fritz and needs to be bumped to come on, if it does at all."
3,Good Light.. Much better after Led Upgrade !,"A very nice size and weight for your pocket or key chain. The fit and finish is the same high quality standards you can expect from Maglite.Walking around the house at night or finding a keyhole it servesit's purpose very well...I suggest adding the Terra-Lux led upgrade bulb to it. ( bought mine fromeBay reseller axsecure51z1.) It almost triples the brightness of the flashlightand the battery lasts a whole lot longer. Yes,it costs almost as much as the light,but it's well worth the money.Even with the stock bulb, this is a good light. With the led upgrade it's amazing..."
1,didnt work for us,After reading all the great reviews we bought this clock for our 8 yr old. We were unable to get the projection to work and had to return it. We are out of pocket for the shipping expenses although the refund for the faulty clock was prompt.Had high hopes but will be looking for a replacement clock.
2,Good click if you are not in Alaska Time Zone,"Clock does all that is claimed, EXCEPT, it will not accept anything farther west than Pacific Time. SO, if you are anywhere but in the lower 48 time zones, you are SOL."
3,Good First Impression,"I really enjoyed this product when I first recieved it. I love the projection of the time on the ceiling. It is large enough to see without glasses which is a plus. However, I have had this product now for about 2 years and I am becoming more and more disappointed with it. I took the batteries out on various occasions when moving so that the buttons would not get pushed. When I tried to reset the time this past time the time would not reset to the atomic clock in colorado even after waiting for several hours. It has never done this before. I have tried to restart it in different locations since then and the time still does not reset to the atomic clock. The clock does work fine after manually setting it but it acts a little goofy sometimes. It just doesn't seem as reliable as it use to be."
4,good clock,"This is a good clock for children; I purchased it for my 7 year old. He loves the thermometer, but dislikes that the clock has to be sideways on the dresser in order for him to read the time; the readout is a little awkward but fun."
4,"My gift, or my boyfriends?","This is a fun and useful clock! My boyfriend got me this for Christmas, and now I know why. He plays with it every chance he gets. The first night, he must have hit the illuminate button 15 times in 5 minutes.Now some serious comments:For those who worry that the projection on the ceiling will bother you - don't worry, it doesn't. I'm an extremely light sleeper who needs complete darkness, but the projection of the clock doesn't bother me at all.I agree that the projection should rotate based on where you position the clock.Also, the only way to see the clock in the dark is to push the illumination button which lasts for 5 seconds. So if you're trying to set the alarm in the dark, you have to keep pushing the button, kind of a pain.For me the clock synchronized in about 10 minutes, so that was no problem.Again - well worth the low price, and one of the more useful gimmicks I've seen."
4,Only works in Continental North America,"This is a great clock, I bought one for my twelve year old daughter several years ago and she loves it. The big downside is if you live in Hawaii (like I do) the automatic time set does not work. It's really a shame that they didn't add in some more time zones! It doesn't seem like it would have been that great of an expense to do this. They did not inform me of this before purchasing, even though I called Oregon Scientific specifically to find out. I was assured that if I was in the U.S. it would work. Hmmmmm, how many people don't know where Hawaii is?It is possible to set it manually and the projection feature is really cool, but without the automatic setting it kind of loses its novelty."
4,Projection Alarm Clock,"The red projected time is very clear and easy to read, even in semi darkness. The alarm is not very loud, at least to my ears, and is not very useful as an alarm clock. Since I purchaced the clock only for the projection capability, that is not a problem."
5,These is a great product,This is great product I have several of them they are good size and good price. I definitely recommend it.
3,My second alarm clock,"This is my second projection alarm clock. the first still works perfectly. but only 3 stars for the 2nd one because the projection light went out after 3 months of use. Attempted to return through Amazon, but was past the limit."
5,Excellent alarm clock,"RM313PNA is an excellent alarm clock.Pros: small on night table, automatically sets time to atomic clock, has easy-to-set increasing loudness alarm, love red time projection (to ceiling) feature, battery back-up, relatively inexpensive. Have had about a month and wonder why we didn't order sooner.Cons: none I can think of."
1,Clock projector died in 10 weeks -- put your cash elsewhere!,"I decided to risk buying this clock in May - despite several reviewers' remarks about their clock's projector lights failing after a brief period of use. Yup. After about ten weeks of use, mine stopped working too. The idea of a projector clock is compelling, but this product truly disappoints. Take your money to a casino -- your chance of success is probably going to be better than putting cash down on a clock of this ilk."
2,"Very Misleading Product, cust service refunded","This product was incredibly disappointing and misleading! I'm not sure how this product ever earned the stars it earned already.1) The clock is incredibly small. This was not a problem, so long as the clock itself was back lit. In order to see the time at night, you have to push the button EVERY SINGLE TIME to see what time it is. When my clock is out of reach, it is problematic to have to nearly get out of bed just to see what time it is.2) The projector does work, but ONLY if the clock is pointing away from you and only points in one direction. It is not adjustable. Just like the issue with the back lit display, you can only see the time projected if you push the button. AND only with the clock facing away from you.What sense does this make? I did contact the seller and they not only refunded my money but also paid to have it shipped back."
3,"Honestly, too small","Do not make this your only clock, it is too small to read off of the clock. Reading it off the ceiling is great, but reading from the clock face is impossible, the numbers and screen is too small."
4,Great! 2nd one for us.,"My wife got one of these for a Christmas gift at work several years ago. It's been a fine clock with a small footprint and clearly visible time projection. I found I was having to roll over to see the time on the ceiling so since it was in the Gold Box I decided to order another. This newer version has temperature (not sure how valuable it is as it seems to be affected by the clock's operating heat - it's stayed within 1F of 68F since I installed it), and the projected time numerals are a larger font and a bit brighter. All-in-all a great clock!"
5,Time on my ceiling,I have owned one of these for over a decade. We love to wake up to the time on the ceiling. One of the digits quit and we welcome this replacement.
3,Projection perfect,"Waking at night, peaking at the ceiling instead of sitting up and looking at the night stand is way more better. Can't say the product is superior to like products, but can say it is awesome! For those who believe that the light will bother them, it shouldn't. I would like to rate this four or five stars, but I can't change the three it defaulted at."
4,Great Alarm Clock,"This is a great alarm clock. The time never needs setting...the overhead projector is a gentle red light that doesn't make the room brighter just because it's on.My only complaint is that the light on the clock itself should illuminate, so that you don't have to look to the ceiling to see what time it is.Love it and would recommend it!"
3,It's only OK,The projection is not the clearest (not like the pictures anyway) but it's adequate. The atomic clock thing didnt work for a while (for me) but the thing is it eventually did. As an alarm clock it does the trick and looks better than the average clock and it's not as pricy as the other models.
5,Great travel clock,"I purchased the clock to use as a travel alarm clock. I have another projection clock for home, so thought a travel projection clock would be pretty cool. I found it works great. I love seeing the time on the ceiling."
2,Oregon Scientific RM313PNA-B Self-Setting Projection Alarm Clock with Indoor,"The clock is accurate and easy to use. The design is sleek. However, the projection feature stopped working after only two weeks."
4,WONDERFUL CLOCK,"For those that have vision problems this clock is a marvel. It lets you see the time displayed at night on the ceiling. It is also great for seniors or children. When you wake up in the middle of the night all you have to do is look at the ceiling and you will know if it is time to get up or not. It takes batters to keep the regular time, sets itself automatically to your time zone, and has the adapter for constant projection at night. During the day if you can't see the display it has a back light that comes on to the touch for a few seconds. All in all this is the best clock I have ever owned and I have hand many throughout the years."
4,Works as expected,"Bought this as a replacement alarm clock. Love the Atomic Time feature, extremely easy to use. I would recommend this to anyone that wants a reliable alarm clock."
3,a fun atomic clock,"This is a great fun atomic clock. You never have to set it, it even adjusts for daylight savings time. Press the top button and it projects the time on the ceiling, no glasses required. For little kids, the time can project on the ceiling all night like an alarm clock. After a while some of the lines in the projected time stopped working, but besides that, it's been going strong."
2,Alarm Clock ?!,"It took ages to arrive as had to come from USA. What seemed like a bargain wasn't once import duty and P&P; was added. To make matters worse the alarm doesn't work - so not much use as an alarm clock!Hardly worth returning it to USA for a refund or new one due to postage but will try to get refund through my credit card. Don't bother with thisOregon Scientific RM313PNA Self-Setting Projection Alarm Clock with Indoor Thermometer, Blue"
3,"Okay Alarm Clock, But Nothing Special","I bought this clock partly because of the projection of the time. Unfortunately, the time projects really small on the ceiling, and since I have glasses and don't where them at night, I can't see it anyway.The actual alarm sound is not extremely obnoxious like loud beeping alarms, but is enough to wake me up without waking up the entire building. Its pretty easy to set the alarm, and the way its set up, you can see the actual time of day and the time your alarm will go off.The instructions were not very helpful. I had to play with it for awhile before I understood how it worked. I like the fact that it has a battery and a cord because in power outages it will still go off.Overall, I would recommend buying this alarm clock if you are a light sleeper and don't mind playing with it to understand how it works."
2,not worth it,"I was very disappointed when I received this clock after reading all the reviews about it and seeing it was a top seller. I bought a competing clock 2 years ago from Amazon and accidentally dropped it and wanted to replace it with the same clock.at the same price..$20...but the clock is no longer available at Amazon (Emerson Research). It had a much more powerful projector, able to swivel, spin it, had HUGE nite glow numbers, also a radio and auto time set.... This junky little thing from Oregon Research is tiny...cheap construction and tiny buttons. It also has a tiny projection feature with no flexibility in viewing angles, and of course it doesn't have a radio. I can't believe this is a top seller on Amazon. I would buy the Emerson (sold at Target) for the same price hands down. (Oh by the way, the satellite time setting feature of the Oregon unit didn't work either). I have returned the unit. Do yourself a favor...keep looking!"
2,Oregon Scientific Projection clock,The numbers on the clock it's self are not all that big. Also if you wear glasses forget seeing the numbers on the ceiling.
3,Good Clock,What can I say...it is an Oregon Scientific. It works very well. I wish the screen was a little bigger. My fault...I should have read more carefully. I like the overhead projection of time...wish I could keep it on. Would buy Oregon Scientific again...probably not this model.
3,Great for Teen Boys!,I bought this for a teenage boy as Christmas present. Wish it has AC/DC connection in addition to 2 AA batteries. Note that projection clock is also stationery and cannot be moved. Looks good though.
3,Oregon Scientific projection alarm clock....blue,Unlike other Oregon Scientific items this clock doesn't live up to the best quality. It is small & the lightweight plastic makes it look and feel cheap.
3,Wish it also projected the temp,Product looks nice. Is easy to set up. but it DOESN'T project the temp....just the time.
4,Alarm a little unreliable,"It works, but for whatever reason I'm not entirely satisfied. If you want the time on your ceiling this is the product for you."
4,Can't Live Without It,"This is a great clock for those of us who can't see a thing at night with our glasses off. No more sitting up to figure out the time, and then not being able to fall asleep again. Unfortunately, the projector on mine just broke after one year. But I can't seem to live without it, so I'm ordering a new one."
1,Great... for awhile,"Loved this clock until the projected LEDs started disappearing, and the time on the wall began looking like the cover to The Police's ""Ghost in the Machine."" Whatever other features it may have notwithstanding, I bought it for the projected clock, and I've wasted my money."
2,Works for U.S. Mainland but NOT HAWAII,"The projection feature is awesome. The convenience of the clock setting itself is why I was happy to have this for my 9 yo. However, it only acknowledges the main 4 US timezones so it won't work for travel or us, because we're in Hawaii. What's the point of a clock in which it doesn't tell the correct time??"
2,Not for international travel,"It is not easy to set time for international zones, where I live. US times are not a problem. It cannot use rechargeable batteries and that is not acceptable. I returned it the day it arrived."
2,Get the Philips AJ3600 instead,"I owned this clock for several years, despite not really liking it. The projector worked fine, but wasn't adjustable at all. But the worst problem with it is setting the alarm... there's just nothing intuitive about it. There are no dedicated hour/minute buttons -- and the buttons that are there are poorly labeled. So you'd better keep the instructions handy.The projector on mine finally died, so I bought the Philips AJ3600 and am so much happier with it. The buttons are infinitely more intuitive, and the projector is adjustable. The Philips also has a 2nd alarm and a radio."
1,Oregon Scientific Fails In Hawaii,"The current version of the Oregon Scientific RM313PNA clock does not work in Hawaii.It automatically sets the time which I found surprising as we are way more than 1500 miles from Colorado.It does not have the ability to recognize HST Hawaii Standard Time Zone and I can't turn the automatic setting off in this current version.The clock recognizes PST but not HST. The older version prior to this update worked fine in Hawaii but this current version does not.So we subtract 2 hours in winter and 3 hours in Summer only tricky part is at the transiting it take about 22 hours to update, I usually switch it to HSTthen I know it updated!Contacted Oregon Scientific and they do not have a fix on this new model."
1,Like a bouquet of plastic flowers on your birthday...,"What a disappointment! I love the Phila Flower Show and have been attending since the days at the old Civic Center. That was what I was hoping to see -- photos from the old days when the escalator lowered you into a garden of Eden. Instead, the book contains photos (very nice indeed) of recent shows, most from this past year's show (2003). Only a few photos of old appear in the beginning of the book. I would have liked to see photos of the shows through the years, diagrams, layouts and photos illustrating what it takes to set up this immense show. The interviews with show stalwarts such as Lee Radon, were great, but just not enough. The show has been in existence for 175 years. The book does not demonstrate this phenomena or the passion of its staying power. All-in-all, its just another coffee table book with pretty pictures. Too bad!"
5,deep insight,wonderful insights.. when shared left others speechless and pondering their own heart... highly recommended. i ended up buying several copies and giving them as gifts to those i hold dearest
5,I bought it for ragman and got more!,I had heard the story of ragman and loved it when I saw this book I got it because I wanted a written version... This is a book full of great short stories that will impact everyone differently!
2,Somewhat disappointed,"We were disappointed in that we've been using Wangerin's writings for our evening devotions. Ragman was very good, but the other short stories did not fulfill our need for devotions."
3,Physical book too seasoned,"Ragman - reissue: And Other Cries of Faith (Wangerin, Walter)Of course this is the book I ordered and I was pleased to receive it, however the book though not damaged seemed to be old--yellowed pages, etc. It was a gift and I was slightly embarrassed to give it."
4,Sequel to The 13th is Magic,"A captivating sequel to Howard's popular (but oh so hard to find) The 13th is Magic, about a brother and sister whose NYC apartment yields magic and adventure on the mysterious thirteenth floor."
3,"Wide variety of songs, many guests artists","Koz's second CD Lucky Man is not as good as his first, but there are still many good songs on this CD. The second song, ""You Make Me Smile,"" is one of the coolest smooth jazz songs I've ever heard, because of the numerous chord changes. I also love the uplifting, energetic ""Saxman,"" which features many guest musicians, such as Maceo Parker on alto sax and Tower of Power's ""Doc"" Kupka on bari sax. ""After Dark"" is also a cool sounding, slow funk tune that's loaded with percussion. This CD is a melting pot of peppy, funk songs and slow ballads with many guest musicians, and Dave has proven that he is one of the greatest ""Saxmen"" in the world."
5,"Is it a bird, is it a plane ? No, it's the SAXMAN !","Born on the west coast, now living between New York and California, when not on the road, Dave Koz is not only a jolly good fellow and a fun DJ. He also is an excellent musician. The toughest critics say he is an imitator of Sanborn. I say that even Sanborn's best album is not as good as this ""Lucky Man"". This CD has it all : Fun (""Lieutenant Castillo"", from ""Miami vice"", on the ""Saxman""), Romance (with a brilliant, as always when singing for other artists, Phil Perry on the vocals), Cover versions (""Don't look any further""), and Power (""Silverlining"", for instance). Difficult for anyone to do better, and a hard challenge for Dave Koz himself (he cleverly did a follow-up that goes in a totally different direction, playing sort of folk-jazz). The album is from 93, but even today it still sounds great, when others sound ""old"". Definetely one of my favourites, if you still had not guessed it by now...."
5,Eye-opener,"Never listened to jazz fusion, until I stumbled on Dave Koz. I have bought lots of fusion since, but this album is still very dear to me. Especially 'Saxman' is my oldtime favorite; it has a great beat! Koz has a great fresh & clear saxophone sound, not mellow & soft, but crisp & clear. Just listen to it!"
5,"Yes, you're in Luck!","I've followed Dave Koz from the get go...and friends this guy lets go on this album. To tell the truth, I've just rediscoved this album. I was listening to the radio and heard ""Shakin the Shack"" and forgot Dave did this one. I then dusted off the album and rediscovered a real gem. Thinking about buying this one? Don't hesitate, push the order button and prepare yourself, your in luck!"
5,A smooth Jazz Masterpiece.,This is one of those cds that you will keep for a long time.Superb perfomance from the first to the last track.Get it now.
1,Buyer Beware!,"I bought this because I was under the impression that because it is named the same thing as the 2oz bottle in the variety pack sold by the same company, that it would be the same scent... Not the case.... If you thought about buying this because you liked the Cubano gold from their variety pack look elsewhere or buy from an actual store so you can compare it.The cologne I received was not the same as the one I had thought it would be and not only that, but amazon has a NO RETURNS policy on ""flammable liquids"" so you aren't able to return this product at all.Very disappointed by this product and I won't be purchasing it again. Buyer Beware..."
4,Good Stuff!,"The Beastie Boys have done it again with Check Your Head. Playing they're own instruments was definetly a good thing. With the right mix of rap, and lots of punk rock, this album is a strong four stars! (Almost five)"
4,A classic,The defining moment in the Beastie Boys career. A classic in every sense; all with an interest in the Beastie Boys should listen.
4,Still checking,"I don't find it as triumphant as the follow-up, but barely a more creative, organic hip-hop album was released then (or now)."
3,Great,"I liked this CD a lot. It does sag with the rhymes though, and when I heard the funky instrumentals for the first time, I really liked it. But then I heard ""In Sound"", and liked a bit less. Hard to put down, though, a great outing from an even better band."
3,A great follow up to their best album,"While definitly not as good as the classic ""Paul's Boutique"". But this is just a different album...with some great tracks...and few garbage ones."
3,what happened??????,"i bought this cd days after purchasing the sampler classic ""pauls boutique"", i listened to it knowing that this was their first album where they played their instruments on almost all the songs, and it aint good, for a few reasons...1.anything to do with samples are gone2.too many instrumental tracks3.barely any songs resembling rap or mc'ing4.some tracks are complete punk rocki can understand the beasties taking a step forward in their creativity but they should've taken the same step that they took from licensed to ill to pauls boutique, this album isn't really old-school rap or a rap cd at all , but an alternative funk rock cd worthy only to die hard fans, if you want to discover real beasties try 'pauls boutique', where they are in top form."
5,Best of the best,The Beastie Boys are the best out there. And this is their best album. 20 songs that are all unique.Best Song:Pass The MicOther great songs:GratitudeFinger Lickin GoodSo Watcha WantStand TogetherPowThe MaestroProfessor BootyIn 3's
4,Check Your Collection,"""Check Your Head"" by the Beastie Boys is their 3rd full length LP, released in '92. Songs like ""Jimmy James"" ""Pass the Mic"" ""Gratitude"" and ""So What'cha Want"" really make this album stand out. The rhyming is good, the beats are catchy, and when they play their own instruments, King Ad Rock, Mike D and MCA play them well. The song ""Gratitude"" is possibly the best song lyrically on this album as well as a funky bassline and powerful guitar chords and words from Ad Rock. A very good song, a very good album. Pick this one up, you won't be let down."
4,"I Love ""Pass The Mic""!!!!!!!!","This is an excellent album from the pioneers of white boy Hip-Hop. The first time I heard ""Pass The Mic"" I said to myself, ""this is a damn good song, These white boys can flow!!!!"" ""Pass The Mic"" is still one of my all time favorite rap songs. The rhymes are clever, slick, and innovative. A masterpiece indeed. The rest of the album is filled with funky grooves, wild samples, and a dash of punk rock, almost on the ""alternative edge""(for lack of a better word). This is an album for anyone whose a fan of progressive hip-hop."
5,Best Beasties Album - Strong and Confident,"Lyrically, they're coming more from the heart here, not just imitating others.Musically, they're at their best. ""Pass the Mic"" is particularly awesome. ""Something's Got To Give"" is a classic piece of music. They continue to use samples to enhance their own funky grooves, brilliantly."
4,Essential,"Each of the Beastie Boys records is very good in its own way. Its hard to describe why I like this one, it has a bunch of great songs and good music backing up the vocals. A must have for any Beastie fan."
2,Doesn't ZAP Mold nor Reduce Humidity Significantly,"The Air-Dryr 1000 is fairly big, produces heat, and intended for small areas. Based on two hygrometers I have, it only covers a small area, mostly above the unit. It does not significantly reduce the humidity in a small bedroom, but perhaps keeps it in a steady level. The heat it produces will also heat up a room by 5-10 degrees F, which is great for cold winters, yet terrible for the hot summer. It may have help reduce the growth of mold and mildew, but does not entirely ""zap"" it as it claims. The positive thing is that is very quiet and does not have any moving parts that need frequent cleaning."
4,Works Great,"This is the second unit I have bought. It works efficiently and puts out just a slight amount of heat to keep the humidity level low. I have one in my truck camper and one in an unisulated storage room. No problems, works as advertised."
5,Davis Air Dryer 1000,This is my first time using the Davis Air Dryer in our summer mobile home. So far it is doing just great keeping the space dryer and smelling better. Put one in my shed also and it has already improved the air quality.
2,Pretty crappy rope,"This spool of rope was dirty (dirt in the rope itself), and there were many poorly done splices throughout the reel. I use it for rewrapping cat scratching posts, and it does an admirable job in this application. However, if you want to use this rope to actually tie down a load or hoist something, you're looking for trouble unless you verify the section of rope you're using doesn't have any splices in it. The splices were so poorly done I could pull them apart with just the strength of my arms."
2,Not as highly recommended as most Sony's are,Use mainly for radio listening. Very selective to what can listen to and does not get the reception usually get from other radios. Antenna breaks easy. Just ordered a second one. Have had other Sony radios and this is the first one not real happy with.
4,Sony ZSH10CP Heavy Duty CD Radio Boombox,"HOLYMOLY! There not kidding when they say Heavy Duty this thing is awesome, sounds great. They kept it simple and functional. Also Its hard to find heavy duty contractor-style radios with a CD player,a definite plus. I have a kid whose rough on stuff, I think this radiio is really going to test his ability for destoying things HAHA"
2,"A shop radio, not a jobsite radio","When I bought this radio it was called a jobsite radio. However, with the cumbersome electrical cord, the cd player that doesn't clip the cds in place, the crappy metal antenna that broke on the second day of use, and the overly large size, this radio is a pain to use on a jobsite. Works fine in a shop where you're not moving it around. Should have gone for the Bosch. Probably why it's now called a ""heavy duty"" boombox."
4,Sony ZS-H10CP Heavy-Duty CD Radio Boombox,"The boombox is very nice and easy to use. It's kind of funny but the only complaint I have on it, is that it looks like a portable generator with the volume control pretending to be the gas cap."
3,Could be better,"the tuner is very weak, picks up stations poorly. there's no tone or bass/treble adjustment. it's not very loud and doesn't sound as good as systems 2/3 its price. i use it in a work environment and have volume at ""11"" just to hear the radio at my workstation. will not rock the house. the brick on the power cord is ridiculous. the box is already heavy, should contain its own transformer."
1,A dud?,"I bought this to use at my school. It's barely been used and never been abused but discs will not play and the volume often does not work. There seems to be a short in it as occasionally I use it as speakers for a computer (line-in capability) since the discs won't play, but often I can't get any more than a level 1 or 2 volume. Give it a smack and suddenly the volume works again. Also, this thing is huge--really not very portable in my opinion. Would not repurchase."
3,Great radio but not made for hot weather!,Great radio but the same thing happened that you see in the pics. CD cover melted and cant use CD's. Also had to sometimes play with the Aux port to get to recognize. Great sound and lasted 3 years for us before finally went dead and this was after leaving outside all the time. I would recommend it but just know if your in AZ or anywhere really hot the CD top is gonna melt. Other than that its solid and can take a beating.
5,Sony Boombox,This product was purchased as a Christmas gift for my son. It arrived in record speed on free delivery and was in it's original package. The package was not damaged in any way shape or form. The Boombox is exactly as Amazon described. Could not be happier with the transacion!
4,Great sound--heavy ac adapter,"Easy to carry--easy to use--great sound. I wish the AC adapter was smaller. I use this to teach water aerobics and so far it's doing well. My only snaffoo is when I walk in from the cold to the warm natatorium, the player can't read cds. Once the cds and the player adjust to the change in temperature, it plays fine."
5,Rugged,I bought this for a harsh work environment for a piece of equipment such as this. I have 20 pound boxes land on this thing all day and it is still running like a champ.
2,Too Big!,"I've been looking for a CD player that I can use outside, mostly to listen to recorded books, so it needs to be portable as I meander through the garden. I read in the reviews that this CD radio/boombox was big, but I ordered it anyway(!) and thought a refrigerator was being delivered when the UPS guy showed up. . . Cripes. . . . it's REALLY big!The sound is outstanding~~good radio reception, too. What's missing, besides easy portability, is a protected spot to place an iPod when it's hooked up. And the CD player top seems flimsy. Although the unit itself has a nice rubbery coating, it just doesn't seem like it could take much outdoor exposure, unless it's somewhat protected from the elements.I have a small Tivo radio that can stand up to this puppy any day. I guess I'll just have to figure out how to put books on my iPod and stick to that.The Sony ZS-H10CP Heavy-Duty CD Radio Boombox has been returned."
1,NOT WATERPROOF AT ALL,left it out on the back porch and got a quick shower.....done deal...i wish there was a waterproof portable radio!!!!!!!
2,Poorly Made Product,"I actually have had two Sony Heavy Duty Boomboxes. I had similar problems with both. I returned the original one & Amazon replaced it (I should have asked for a refund). The radio reception is poor unless the signal is close. The sound quality is good. The CD cover on both units warped. The LED is hard to read in daylight & sometimes at night. It often does not retain the radio presets when turned off. It burns through batteries, especially when playing CDs. There has got to be a better product on the market, especially given the price."
4,Very happy,Sony seems to have corrected the issues from early reviews. The antenna does now swivel if pulled all the way out. FM station rejection is OK in a huge market (Atlanta GA) where even my Alpine car unit has issues with strong near by stations. My preset stations did hold through a power disconnect with no batteries (although it was a short disconnect).Pros:Large simple easy to use controlsMP3 player with song and artist displayLarge size but light weight with no batteriesBig sound with Big bassVery long power cord (with a brick in it)Cons:Audio is some what muffled (not bad but I hoped for better)I would recommend this product.
1,Whats the point of having the transformer as a separate annoying piece to deal with,"This radio's reception is awful.The antenna is very cheap, and useless.And for some reason, the professionals at sony decided that they would have the transformer be a separate item to deal with. WHY?? anyone? anyone?The only redeeming part of this radio is the fact that it plays cds.I would avoid this radio at all costs. Don't be fooled into wasting your money on this just because it looks cool."
5,Great radio,"I bought this radio with its features in mind. It has the ability to let you plug in an auxillary music source, and plays MP3s. I have used it both ways and as an ordinary radio. It has great sound and contrary to another review has plenty of volume. It is a bit large, doesn't have a remote, and the ac adapter is heavy. Overall I would buy it again."
3,not all I had hoped for,"I'll echo a few of the other reviews about the antenna. I put the stereo on my car seat with the antenna extended a little and leaned in. Next thing I know the antenna is bent, soon breaking off. That is my biggest complaint. Secondly, I had hoped the c.d. portion had better skip protection as did my previous sony purchase but even small to medium bumps send the song skipping along. Next, it is huge! Much bigger than I thought. Probably my fault for not looking at its dimensions on the website, but oh well. Lastly its radio station reception both am and fm leave a lot to be desired. On a positive note it sounds great and programs very easily."
5,GREAT product!,"AWSOME sound, fast track-to-track navigation in both MP3 and plain cd, very durable construction and pretty light for it's size. the only downside to this product is it DOES NOT come with the software stated. you must download that directly from Sony."
5,Loving good music,"i needed a louder more durable radio for outside BBQing, and seafood boils, this works great !It also will catch far away stations."
3,The Radio is Water Resistant But the Power Cord Isn't,"I bought this radio for outdoor use at a work site. It seemed to have all of the features that I was looking for in a boom box: water resistance, a CD player, AM/FM radio and the ability to run from a power outlet instead of having to run on batteries.In reality, the AM/FM reception of this radio is not very good, and if there is something else plugged into the same outlet as the radio, it barely gets any stations at all. This is a bummer because it is supposed to be a work site radio, right?The worst thing about this radio, as far as I'm concerned, is the fact that the power adapter is not water resistant, so it needs to be disconnected and stored somewhere waterproof while the radio isn't in use. However, there's no storage compartment for the power adapter on the radio itself. So, we had to buy a separate waterproof container to store the power cord in."
2,Too large; not better than alternatives,"I've had a couple other Sony boomboxes, and they still sell several different varieties. I selected this because it had a line in for Ipod and because I thought it might have a larger sound and be more durable. It sounds no better than the others, and I think it really is mostly the same thing but in a MUCH LARGER package. It is so much larger as to be unwieldy. It enables FM presets but you have to scroll through and can't go directly to your choice. The advantage of the line in does not offset the weaknesses IMHO."
5,Wished I had that as a teenager........,"We are using the Sony Boombox ZSH10CP mainly at the poolside - perfect for that hence protected against water splashes.Sound at FM + CD + Ipod (need to purchase cable - see below*) is tops, with AM radio still OK plus.Reception: Receiving most FM stations without retrieving the telescopic antenna, AM reception is evenly good.Fun factor: HUGE!Kindly NOTE: This is pretty big equipment! Great that you can leave the AC adapter (included) at home when going to the beach, making it a little lighter.So - well built gear, great sound, easy to handle (big wheel for volume, nice buttons at the side) combined with very good radio reception: FIVE stars without a blink & highly recommended.*To connect Ipod (or other MP player) I useAurum Cables Car Stereo Ipod/mp3 Auxiliary Aux-in Input Cable 3.5mm (6 Ft/1.8m)@ $ 5.99 from Amazon - long enough & matching color (black/red)"
4,Good value for the price,"Overall I am very satisfied with this product. I wanted a sturdy boombox to use outside while working or playing and this fits that very nicely. Like the compartment to store the power so you can hide it away when not needed but have it available if close to a power outlet. Saves on batteries. The only reason I did not give this a full 5 star rating is that when connecting an MP3 player to the unit, which is one of the features I wanted most, the volume doesnt go as loud as will a CD or an MP3 CD. It is still pretty loud, but if there is other noises around it would be better if it would go as loud as when you play CD's. But that being said I would still recommend this product. I used it this past summer quite a bit and worked great."
3,"Indestructible, so far",My 6-year-old uses this and hasn't figured out a way to destroy it after several months.
2,disappointed,"This radio get lousy reception, even at the drive in theater where the transmitter is about 50 yards away.It gets no stations at my house. Although it is HUGE it is not loud. I think the antennae is too short, I put a longer antennae on and that did not help. I have had this radio for about a year. It's main use would be to sit there all big and red and expensive looking and hope that if a burglar ever comes when I am not home that they will steal this instead of one of my good radios. It plays home made mp3 cd's well . but the radio is pretty much useless."
3,Sent it back,"I teach waterfitness at both indoor and outdoor pools. I've always used a water resistant boombox and thought this one would be great! It is too big and difficult to carry from pool to pool. The sound was not as good as I expected from Sony. Even at full volume, it just didn't ""boom"". Reception was fuzzy and the antenna broke after 1 week and gentle use. I was very disappointed and now have to start all over for a water resistant portable audio."
2,not up to the name,"I recently purchased the sony boombox, the sound is ok, Im content with that and the way everything is placed, but a real problem is the cd player, after only playing approximately 5 cds it has started to skip randomly. I purchased thinkin it had sony quality, now Im not so sure."
1,Antiquated POS,"Do not buy this Boom Box. I haad one stop working that I bought 2-3 years ago. It just died. I ordered a new one - it quit agter 3 weeks outside & yes it rained on it. So what, it is suposed to be able to take the rain. Returned for a refund"
5,Don't Start That Stuff By Henry Gray & Short Fuse,This is a very good CD because of Short Fuse. They're the best and they have awsome lyrics and this CD is very very very very good!
2,Very Rough,They really mean exfoliating when describing this sponge. It has too rough a surface to use on anything but my feet.
4,Turn On The Heat,Like all products this one expects a little intelligence from the owner. In order to use the heat you have to push the heat button right next to the massage button. The heat was enough to almost cause me to shut off the heat. The massage was enough to feel it throughout my neck and shoulders. I use this unit in combination with a shiatsu massage chair and it is great.Almost a complete body massage. I also use a foot massager at the same time. Twenty minutes and I'm ready to roll!
2,neck massager,I received the massager when expected.The neck massager is not made for people with large neck sizes (18) as the massage is very weak.The different sounds were distorted and to loud.I had a friend try it on who has a smaller neck size and she seemed to like the massage and also said the sounds were distorted and to loud.
3,They expected too much.,The previous reviewers evedently expected too much. My unit gives sufficient heat on my neck and a good relaxing massage. My only complaint is that it doesn't go out to the shoulders more. All in all though it's what I excpected. This relaxing sounds are ok.
1,Not what I expected!!,This did not bring any tension relief but may have actually increased it. Buy something else. I would have returned it if I hadn't missed the return window.
1,Neck,Didn't like it so sent it back. I don't know what else to say. It arrived on time. Nothing else to review.
1,"Bad fit, can't hook it back together","If you buy this item or plan on buying it, make sure you see how it's unhooked before you nurse. I just snapped it apart without looking at what I was doing and now I can't figure out how to get it back together. Plus the top straps that stay put when you unhook it don't fit right."
3,"Nice, but own all her 3 CD's","For awhile, this import was the only CD that was available of Ellen Foley's music. It's a good mix of songs from her 3 albums : NIGHT OUT, SPIRIT OF ST. LOUIS and ANOTHER BREATH. The sound is fine, but the packaging is minimal . Really, now that all 3 albums are easily available as US releases , it makes this collection needless. All 3 albums are essential if you really are a fan of La Foley's amazing voice and talent. You won't have any missing songs, and for what you pay for this pricey import, you can get all 3 CD's for the same price. Even though this CD was released years ago, any fan of her tremendous voice will want the 3 albums on CD reissued on Wounded Bird, 2 of which have bonus tracks ."
2,Not Good Quality,"What I look for in a wallet is this: quality and storage room. This wallet has the second factor down flat, with plenty of room of bills and coins and a multitude of slots (11 to be exact) for credit cards. However, the quality is just poor, or at least my expectations of ""made in Italy"" was not met, at all. The leather is scrunched in places it should not be, and appears to be dirty. Even though it is in a sealed package, I suspect the wallet was used. The brass buttons for the zipper clasp shows some discoloration, indication of wear. The tone of the leather is quite uneven in the credit-card slots. I would suggest not buying this wallet online if you never have seen a specimen of it in person. It may not be what you expect."
3,A mostly different book,"The art, author, and some images are the same, but My World is a disparate set of very short verses, phrases, and repetitions, and doesn't share cohesiveness, cadence, or placidiy with it's better known ""companion"" Goodnight Moon.On the other hand, it's a very nice book, very pleasant, not as brief or calming but still a bit of both, and familiar enough to our son even on the first read that he quite enjoys it - and, i suspect, our daughter will too."
2,Unimpressed,"My grandsons love ""Goodnight Moon"" and my children loved ""The Runaway Bunny"", so I thought this was a find! Although it is the same rabbit family, the story isn't much. Not recommended."
1,"Gentle and simple? Sure, but ....","Someone else described this anomalous work as ""gentle and simple"". I can't contest those adjectives, but truly this book makes no sense whatsoever. When my son brings it to me I try to figure out what the heck the authors were thinking, but time and again I draw a blank. The words seem like something Syd Barrett might have scribbled after his brain liquified. And what the heck is up with the last few drawings being like an inch square?"
2,My My My My My My My --- Blech!,"Guess I should've known from the title: MY world. But for someone who's actively trying to discourage the ""my"" and ""mine"" language of a toddler, this book was a disaster. The entire book is filled with ""Mother's chair. My chair."" ""My spoon. Daddy's spoon."" ""Bang Bang Bang--My car."" You get the point. Plus, I second a previous reviewer's sentiment that I dread every time my daughter brings me this book to read. Look, I absolutely LOVE Goodnight Moon and Runaway Bunny and will joyfully read those books the gazillion times she asks for them. But this book is awkward and feels like it's trying a little too hard to be cute or arty. I vote NO on this world."
5,Really interesting story!,"I was pleased with the pictures in the book. It arrived in new condition and looked very interesting for reading to my grandchildren. Since it is a Christmas gift, I have not actually read it. I'm just hoping they like it!!!"
4,My World,This is a great companion to Goodnight Moon. My 3-year old loves that the little bunny is in another book.
2,Just stick with Goodnight moon,"I was a bit disappointed with this one. It's from the author of Goodnight Moon, which I have to admit is far, far better. This book doesn't really have much of a flow to it and is really choppy. It doesn't even rhyme in some places. Anyway, my daughter really disliked this book and I recommend just sticking Goodnight Moon."
3,Definitely not Goodnight Moon,"My son has grown up reading the books of Margaret Wise Brown and was very excited to find another book in the series. However this book is not as rhythmic and lyrical as Goodnight Moon and when my son was really young, he did not have the attention span for this book. He did recognize the pictures and liked identifying the objects in the book, and so the book did have some value for us later on. Would buy it from the bargain section if you find it there."
3,"My kids love it, although it's low on MY list...","Margaret Wise Brown must have known what types of illustrations and prose appeal to small children, because my kids love ""My World"". However, it is not one of MY favorites, especially compared to her other books. If I could divide up my ratings by audience, I'd says one star for adult readers, 4 stars for children."
1,I should have listened to all the bad reviews...,"My 22 month old & 3 y/o are in LOVE with the Goodbye Moon book and I was so excited to see a companion book to it. I purchased this book for Christmas and regret doing so! The book does not transition smoothly, does not make sense, its awkward to read and most important the kids toss it to the side and will not stay captivated when I open it. It has gone into our pile of give-aways. Dont waste your $$$!!!! The Goodnight moon 123 counting book is a much better alternative!"
3,Didn't live up to my expectations,"I waited with great anticipation only to be disappointed. The smooth, flowing rhymes of the other Margaret Wise Brown books were not present in this book. My 2-1/2 year old enjoyed looking at the cover (he instantly recognized the rabbits he loved in Good Night Moon), but he quickly lost interest when we started reading. Even my husband didn't want to continue reading the book. I would definitely recommend purchasing Good Night Moon, The Runaway Bunny, or Big Red Barn instead. My son (and I) thoroughly enjoyed each of them!"
1,Not an Enduring Masterpiece,"My son can listen to and look at ""Goodnight Moon"" and ""Runaway Bunny"" ten times each time we sit down with them. We barely got through ""My World"" once.The rhymes simply don't click and the story is not interesting enough to make up for it. I believe the illustration that made my son ask the most questions was one of toothbrushes hanging by strings on nails in the wall. He had never seen such a thing, but seemed interested in the prospect of putting his toothbrush on the wall.I suppose that was the reason he really didn't get interested in the book: he didn't identify with it. His daddy doesn't go fishing or sit on the front porch smoking his pipe. Now, he's never become a sailboat as the bunny in ""Runaway Bunny"" did either, but he was interested in the idea; it captured his imagination. ""My World"" didn't.Perhaps there are some children who might enjoy this, but definitely take it out of the library first before you buy it."
5,Don't be fooled - children love it!,"When I first read this book to my then one-year old daughter, I thought it was awful! She, however, would pick it up again and again, demanding to read it. It's been one of her favorites for over 9 months. In fact, I'm about to order a new copy because the first has been ""loved"" to death."
1,A Travesty,"For children who love ""Goodnight Moon"" and ""The Runaway Bunny,""this book is a huge disappointment. The pictures by Clement Hurd are enticing, reminding one of the previous books. But the text makes no sense at all. One expects rhyme but doesn't get it. Next there is an attempt at rhyme which doesn't make sense. Any attempt at a theme or continuity is a mess. Don't buy this book! The publishers are simply pawning this off as a companion to ""Goodnight Moon."""
3,Water Spill on Dust Cover,"The dust cover on the bookMy World: A Companion to Goodnight Moonappeared to have had a water spill, the paper was rippled and you could see a water stain. The book was not damaged. As I had ordered the book as a gift for a 20 month great-grandchild, I figured the dust cover wouldn't be with it long and I decided to give the book as a gift as it was. Too much trouble to return the item!"
3,Disappointing Sequel,"This little book was touted as the sequel to the classic ""Goodnight Moon"" by the same author and illustrator. While this book is all right, it does not reach the quality of prose of the original. Nor are the illustrations as detailed and interesting. I especially missed hunting for the mouse on every page."
1,No rhythm - awful,"I probably have to read this book 5-6 times a day to my 1 year old son. (Actually, I have to read most of his books 5-6 times a day. That's part of the joy of having a toddler!) I dread each time he comes to me with ""My World"" held high. The beauty of ""Goodnight, Moon"" is in its rhythm - it is pleasant to read out loud. Brown's ""The Big Red Barn"" also has a fairly good rhythm. This book is jarring and discordant, almost as if Brown wanted to display the English language at its clumsiest. The illustrations are decent, but not great. Do yourself a favor. Your toddler will listen to anything. Buy him/her some Sandra Boynton books, or something from the ""Tender Mercies"" series. Buy ""Goodnight Moon"". Buy Dr. Seuss, (especially ""In a People House""!) Don't buy ""My World""."
5,A Book Of Five Rings,"This book is a complete classic. Much like Sun Tzu, it deals with resolving conflict (hopefully in the reader's favor). The points of order included, have moved into the business world, as we no longer walk the streets with swords.Keep re-reading. All will become clear. Asia is at the doorstep, and business will be fine, if you understand the views and customs of Asia :)"
4,the book of five rings,"I am not into martial arts, but the lessons here are revealing for all challenges. As a musician, I particularly liked the statement ""There is even rhythm in emptiness."""
3,An actual disappointment,"I didn't read this book and I don't think I will. It isn't really a book it's a miniature, only not as attractive. Perhaps this is the book tucked into the obis of baby samurais before they went off to play school, perhaps it's just a joke. An actual book it isn't. I suggest you check the stats of this book so you can buy wisely, something I wish I had done. It's 4 1/2"" x 3"" x less than a 1/2"". So tiny."
4,Good because of the inclusion of Munenori's book,"It is likely that most readers will buy this book being interested in the ""legend"" of Musashi Miyamoto. Personally I prefer the ""book of family traditions on the art of war"" which is also included in this book. In Yagyu Munenori's words ""[the art of war] is not to kill people, it is to kill evil"". This was interesting enough for me to read the rest of the book of Munenori. So 4 stars for Munenori."
4,The Book of Five Rings by Miyamoto Musashi,"This book is a perfect example of delving into the mind of a GREAT! warrior and tactician. This book entails the Bushido code of Feudal Japans' greatest warrior,Miyamoto Musashi. He embodies Bushido. It's a great read. Thank You."
1,boring and full of nonsense,This book was full of ramblings of an old man and will make little sense to anyone reading.
1,Sent me the wrong book,Well i chose the rating because The book to the left in the imagine is the one i expected to get a nice hardcover of it. written by thomas clearly instead ive received a book writtin by a different author half the size of that book and cheap little paper book. i looked at the back of the book and i over paid for it by 6 dollars. Not the book i want and i think its disgusting people try to get away with making money like this.
3,Not Enough of Musashi's Art,"The title led me to hope that the book would contain photographs of Musashi's fine art. It doesn't. It does contain photographs of works by other artists, some of which are quite well done. That fact, however, did not compensate for its complete lack of photographs of Musashi's works, which are at a level above those of all but a few of the most famous Japanese fine artists."
4,Opening your mind to new Possibilities!,"They way Myamoto Musashi expresses his ideas and techniques on proper form not only in regards to swordplay, but all around strategy for life, makes you believe you can accomplish anything (take that Stephen Covey!) Although I will be the first to admit that some sections are more obscure and difficult to process than others, all in all, this is a great book to have and read periodically, if not to improve oneself, then at least it is a great mental excercise just trying to ponder and garner the meanings behind the teachings of Musashi. A worthwhile read if you have the mental stamina for it."
1,Dated,"Interesting as a document from the Edo period, but dated and awkward as a book targeted in translation for modern Western businesspeople dealing in Japan. Fascinating as a straightforward historical first person account of the life and personal philosophy of a warrior from Shogunate Japan, but almost silly to the extent that it attempts to be more. The commentary is can be skipped entirely, as it attempts to read far to much into the text (not much of which feels relevant today); but it leaves the reader suspicious of the translation iteslf, which seems strained in several places."
2,Rings,I still have not finished the book. There are some deep meanings here but it also needs some thought to apply the principles to your life. I will have to finish it when I have some spare time.
5,Everybody is certainly listening except for the one star reviewer and her aliases,"The previous three one star reviewers are frustrated little girls who just want to counter all five star reviewers for NO REASON.Everybody's listening is a great cd from the crime tour.I would plead with you to ignore all previous and subsequent one star reviewers and their recommendations.this cd is great,so buy it because I said so."
4,survived hurricane ike!,a quick hose down and the bench looks like new. perfect for my screened porch.
2,Don't sit on it for long!,Bought three of these to use on a pontoon boat. Thought it would kill two birds with one stone. Was dissappointed to find that the seat on all three of them caved in. These are all less than 6 months old and were not overloaded.
5,Great addition to my garden,Looks super and is very sturdy. Now my tools are hidden away and we have a place to sit and enjoy the garden.
4,Thank you,I don't like to write a lot of words. I just want to thank you for your service and for a great product. thank you. Sincerely Linda Johnson
3,not worth the $10 it costs,"This book is the size of your palm and only has about three to four words of text on a page.Not to mention it is only about 12 pages long.. The idea is good, but not worth the $$."
3,Stegner book,"Trying to complete gift to library of Stegner'swritings. Book arrived in timely fashion, not super clean.Gifted to library."
3,It's OK,"After hearing the huge 2001 hit ""Lady"" a song with a cool dancable sample and nice hook, you might have thought that the rest of the songs would sound the same, but they don't. Most of them are soulish disco tracks, a few slow soul songs as far from beeing reffered as dance music as possible and some simply instrumental dance songs. The french duo's debut album ""Modjo"" is far from a bad dance album but it could have been much better. Dance albums mixed with soul are often easy to listen to and actually quite good too, the dissapointing thing however is that some songs are not even dance songs. Modjo is more of a soul group that turned dance then the opposite. Apart from ""Lady"" we have Songs like ""Chillin"" and ""What I Mean"" that are decent too, actually a quite easy listening album. Nothing that will go down in history but ok."
3,Serviceable,"These shorts fit fine and the fabric holds up well, but I can't help but feel like a mailman on his day off wearing these, not that there's anything wrong with mailmen or that I feel like they don't deserve a day off its just its not really for me."
3,Pretty good,"I ordered a size smaller than I usually do for shorts, and they fit pretty well (but are still a bit on the baggy side). The pockets are velco-fastened and are big but don't stick out. They are comfortable and feel sturdy. Overall good shorts."
2,OK until the zipper pull fell off on 2nd wearing,"Shorts seemed OK initially, but on the 2nd wearing the zipper pull tab fell off. Unfortunately for me, I didn't get around to wearing them until just outside the return window."
3,Dickies loose fit cargo shorts,These shorts are very good. I will probably purchase them again. My only disappointment is that they are fading after a few washings and they require ironing. I would like them much more if they were color fast and permanent press.
4,Exactly as described.,"Exactly as described. This item was was well packaged, shipped and received promptly, and was exactly as described. This is a good product and was good customer service. The only reason I gave a 4/5 is because 1) they did end up fitting just a little loose, and 2) the belt loops need to be spaced out a little better, the front ends up bunching up under your belt because the front belt loops aren't far enough forward. Overall, good buy, however."
4,Dickies 43-214 13 Inch Cargo Shorts,"I wanted to get another pair of shorts like the previous one that I had ordered. I supposed that I didn't proof read the order carefully enough. This pair is constructed of much lighter weight fabric, and the price was higher. They are very comfortable though. Guess I will convert them to use during couch potato activities.Not related to the merits of the product is the seemingly excessive shipping time. The USPS shipping is so slow. It took the post office 9 days to transport, via Priority Mail, from Michigan to Texas."
1,dickies shorts,I purchases 6 items for my first Amazon purchase all other items perfect. My dickie 36 inch short are not 36 inch. I think they are 38 inch. I have other dickie 36 inch shorts that i purchased while traveling in USA and they are not the same. It is to much trouble and effort to try and return them i am just going to right them off.
1,Dated,"Products like this one are the reason why there's a stigma of scrapbooking being an ""old woman's"" hobby (when in fact scrapbooking as it's known today has only been around since the 1980's).The first thing I said when I opened this was, ""It looks so dated!"" I promptly returned mine and canceled my order for the Baby themed book.Do not buy this product if you're under the age of 70."
2,Small body clips,"These clips are smaller and thinner than what came with my Traxxas 1/10th scale Slash. Depending on your intended use, consider the larger body clips."
1,great but..,they aren't as durable as i was hoping after using them for 3 days i had to replace them with four more because they bent and wouldnt stay
3,smaller than stock for my 1/10th,I picked up 4 12 packs since shipping only went up a penny each item and your going to loose clips. These must be made for a 1/16th cause they are small. they still fit but are a pain to put on or take off.
1,Home remedy,just use some hairpins. they hold it just as tight and u can find them in the house! this is not worth the 4 dollars and at the hobby store u can get for cheap!
2,Very disappointing,"This book was a real letdown. It is a long, long diatribe on the Gaskell biography - if I saw the name Gaskell one more time, I was going to throw the book out the window. Where was Anne ? Why so much retread on the same theme, Gaskell, Gaskell, Gaskell ? I was prepared to really enjoy this, but found only a few good theories and themes, how we as the public have given the Bronte sisters, through the years, personalities that we want them to have. Ok, interesting premise of cultural obsession. The book did not quite explain that as well as I would have liked. If you want to see the word Gaskell in print about 200 pages, this is the book for you."
4,More than halfway decent,"I needed this book for an upper-level university course on the Bronte sisters. It is adequately well-written, and my passion for the subject has kept me intrigued enough to finish it (as well as the requirement for class, of course!). Miller's writing style, however, is just a bit annoying--the tone is rather informal, treading somewhere between the ""novellized history"" of Irving Stone, and the usual voice found in English texts. I found that she carries off neither effectively, though if she had just chosen one or the other she surely would have been able to.Definitely a worthwhile read overall, though--very insightful for anyone who has an interest in the Brontes."
3,Kind of boring,So I really wanted to like this book but found it to be somewhat boring and I never finished it!
2,"Not a book, a New Yorker article maybe","I couldn't decide whether to buy this book and so ordered through my local library. Wise choice. This is not really a full-length study but rather an expanded article/essay that falls apart after the first third. Repetitive, reductive and sounds like an extended PhD dissertation. A real disappointment. Needed a good editor (like get rid of some of the unnecessary 'sics' and the repetition that borders on perseveration)."
4,Surreal and lovely.,"Suehiro Maruo, Mr. Arashi's Amazing Freak Show (Blast, 1992)Mr. Arashi's Amazing Freak Show was the first of Suehiro Maruo's manga to be translated into English, and it's pretty easy to see why he developed a cult following among extreme horror fans almost overnight. From the opening panels of this twisted, disturbing graphic novel, Maruo is going to go for the gut. You're probably going to like it for the images alone. Which is good, because the story is told in impressionist form, to the point of losing a good deal of the story (an old folk tale about a girl tricked into becoming the slave of a sideshow) in the process. Granted, some of that could be happening in the translation, but I doubt it; pages of panels would have to be intercut for a truly faithful retelling of the folk tale.Still, it's a very pretty thing, as long as extreme gore fits your definition of pretty. ***"
4,Not for the squeamish,"Otherwise, enjoy! This manga sparked the start of many other 'guro' graphic novels. Yes, it is gruesome and intense. But that's what's part of the appeal to this book. I'm actually surprised to find bits and pieces of the film on youtube. To my knowledge, the book was never turned into a movie because no one wanted to produce it since it was so terrifying and gory. Well, I'm guess I'm glad that Suehiro found a way somehow.That said, I was especially surprised by the ending. I don't wanna spoil it, but let me tell you-I loved it!"
1,Could not take it anymore after 10 minutes!,"There is no political or strategic explanation for the war or events leading to it. Most annoying, the speaker is reading poetry instead of giving an objective account of such events. Apparently, the ideological nature of the war, which drew ""intellectuals"" and volunteers from many countries, is emphasized by this poetical bias. I want objective facts. I did no buy a literary work. I could not take it after 10 minutes, and I did not watch anymore."
2,The History Of warfare> The Spanish Civil War,I was disappointed in the quality of the content a bit poor in presentation.The fact it was cheap should have alerted me to this fact.
4,Start With This One...,"For those of you checking out Richard Elliot for the first time, this album's a great place to start. Deep Blue is one of his best tunes ever, as well as By The Fire, Just Do It, & Sweat. There's even some nice covers such as 10CC's-I'm Not In Love, and Because I Love You. There's even some soulful vocals for those who don't care for all instrumental albums. Definitely a keeper for your Jazz collection."
5,Where has this book been all my life?,"Well, damn. I mean, I LIVE here, and why haven't I seen this book before? There are unique cafes everywhere in San Francisco's cosmopolitan Bay Area, and what can be more cosmopolitan than discovering a new one, sitting at streetside between the fog rolling out and rolling back in, sipping a latte, and indulging in a little People Watching? I love it. There are more than 300 wonderful color photos, a directory to the more than 340 cafes profiles, lots of vignettes, tidbits, gossip items, and even some recipes.What's not to love?"
1,The Lost Tribes of Israel; The History of a Myth,"This book clearly does not address any current factual information regarding the lost tribes of Ysrael. He merely states a propostion and spends the entire book justifying his conclusion. Poorly written and disconnected writing style with little or know facts support by any scientific or historical evidence. Certainly not worth reading for those interested in finding plausible and documented information regarding the lost tribes of Ysrael. I suggest reading Babylon to Timbuktu, and current Genetic test results of the East African Lemba tribe."
1,Hack job,"Poorly written book. There's a mountain of evidence that shows the account of the ten lost tribes is no myth. The author simply ignores the data that he doesn't like, rather than at least explore it and present a nuetral view. The lost tribes have turned up in India, Yemen, Central Asia,Ethiopia, on the border of Mynamar, the Caucuses,and even intermarried with the Celts. I would reccomend the A and E DVD ""Quest for the Lost Tribes"" by Simcha Jacobovici instead."
4,Tough enough to keep learning from,"Got this for my niece. She may be a bit young for the logic now, but she already enjoys pushing the buttons and rolling it around. Dad played with it more than she did. It took a few drops and slams with no problem. Has a low volume setting so mom and dad don't go nuts!"
3,OK for travelling,This is a light and compact item perfect for travelling. The sound quality is OK for a small radio. Missing a snooze button which would have been very nice. The flip clock pannel is fragile.
4,"Cherry Red edited ""Gotta Get Out Tonight""","I love my new CD copy of WFTN. But I noticed something almost funny. The first half second of ""Gotta Get Out Tonight"" has a very clear (and well known among fans) ""raspberry"" sound just before the first guitar chord. It is completely missing in the CD version. Isn't it ironic that a label known for punk (Cherry Red) would edit out a fake flatulence sound?"
5,The new old samba,"Max de Castro brings a new freshness to traditional Brazilian music forms, by incorporating funky, soul, drum n bass elements. This is an exceptional piece of music, for people who like exciting music from every corner of the planet."
2,I was very disappointed,"I read other reviews of this book and literally rushed over to the bookstore in anticipation. I was very disappointed with this novel because it was not the page-turner promised. The plot was slow. Another friend who bought the book at the same time as me, refuses to finish. She gave up on the book. Toward the end, the story picked up but it was not enough to save the book. Save your [money], I sure wish I could get mine back!"
1,Could have been better!,I could not bring myself to finish the book. It was too slow. I would not recommend it. If you would like to read it: borrow! I hope the next novel is better.
2,Don't judge a book by it's cover,"We've all heard don't judge a book by it's cover. No matter how much we visualize our own vision while reading, you cannot help but to wonder or figure out what the author was trying to do by putting these 2 people on the cover., it's totally misleading. Furthermore, the book was really boring, it was nothing exciting nor did anticipation make me want to read this book. I will credit the author for having such wonderful writing skills. She should have opt to sticking to one character per book. Maybe her 2nd novel will be better."
5,Yipeee for JJLamon,"I was on the edge of my seat. Having been a young adult in the 80's, I could relate to all of the imagery....the language and the songs.. oh my...I could taste the early 80's. As I read, many times people heard me laugh out loud or go "" OH SNAP!!!!!""...it was like a new surprise around every turn...JJL is my new fav author. ..."
4,The message of the sermon on the mount,"Great insight, good depth, we're using this book in a bible study and hearing many great comments from many of the members."
5,"Excellent, provacative and informative",I use all John Stott's books for study and teaching and have found them to be excellent. Many have study questions in the back.
1,Completely Inaccurate,"I have had this one for several years. Only recently, after buying another Oregon Scientific hygrometer for another room, did I realise that their hygrometer gauges are pure fantasy, they vary, between them, by up to 20 per cent (i.e. one says 35% the other 57%)."
1,"No atomic time, bad wireless reception","[...], we were unable to ever get the ExactSet clock to work. We sat it next to a [...] radio shack exact time clock, and the radio shack clock set itself within five minutes, while the Oregon Scientific clock couldn't pick up a strong enough signal after five days. In addition, the wireless reception was unreliable."
3,Good product,Unfortunately base unit does not display temperature in Celcius. Outdoor remote sensor sometimes does not transmit data...
5,Great value for the $,"Beautiful white headboard. Arrived in perfect condition. Great value for the money. Had previously bought 2 other white headboards that were cheaply made, arrived damaged, and had more parts to assemble. This was easily and quickly put together (under 20 minutes). Works on a queen bed or a full. Very happy with the purchase."
1,Same problem!,"We had the same problem as other reviewer. Ordered full, got twin. Glad we didn't reorder. Price was right for full, but I would not pay 250 plus dollars for the quality of the headboard that was sent."
5,very nice!,I wanted a headboard to somewhat match the headboard on my full size antique bed and this headboard was exactly what I was looking for. I ordered the mahogany twin size. It is very well made and was extremely easy to assemble.
1,Wrong Size,Unreal. Ordered it three times and received a twin instead of queen every time. I love Amazon but this is rediculous.
4,Good,"I'm a medical professional and overall, this a good book. It's got a wealth of many ailments, diseases, etc. It doesn't cover too many rare conditions, but does cover a ton. Not a bad book to have in your house for information or guidelines. I use it to refresh my brain when I don't remember certain things about a disease... easier to find it and some basic facts compared to some of my medical books. This is no substitute for medical advice, but no book is."
2,Not the best value for your money,I bought this because I am tired of resetting my travel clock and thought (foolishly) that it would be 'so easy'. Well the atomic part worked -- after about 13mins the radio transmission worked -- but I could not get the backlight or snooze alarm to work at all. I returned it for full refund and bought the larger Atomic Clock. Just got back from a restful relaxing vacation where I did NOT have to mess with the travel clock.
1,Poorly thought out design.,"Initially, I loved this clock. However, it's flaws soon became apparent. The snooze/backlight control is the stand which proved to be very fragile and broke within a couple of months. The buttons are difficult to manipulate and require steady pressure to activate the setting changes. With only a 90 day warranty, it's not worth the price paid because the buyer pays the price for inadequate design."
5,Exactset Automatically Adjusting Atomic Travel Alarm Clock,I received my Atomic Clock within the week I ordered it and love it! I was totally amazed how it adjusted itself by the following morning. It's been the talk of my department at work too! It's just the right size for a nightstand or desktop. The backlighted face will prove valueable when I move to our new location. I'm thinking about purchaseing another one so I can keep one at home and one at work. Too back I won't be able to use the Atomic feature in Europe!!
5,i love this clock,"I've been a flight attendant for 25 years and I have used several different travel alarms. When this clock was given to me as a gift, I didn't think that I would ever like anything better than my Seiko, but I haven't used it for years. This is my favorite alarm clock EVER, not just travel clock. It's the only one I use. It's easy to use, the alarm signal is perfect, I love the easy time zone adjustment and it's very accurate. I set ALL my other clocks by it. I love this clock. mark w."
2,Mixed Feelings,"Atomic clock setting does not work in New York, NY. Called Oregon Scientific and they verified this was the case and had no solution.Clock does work okay under manual mode."
5,pollen mask,This year seems to be real bad for pollen....I ride a motorcycle and find this a big relief...I also use it to cut grass.
1,Callous delivery,"On the order page Amazon did not mention the size of the mask. Naturally, i presumed it to be of a free size or as something that could be adjusted to the required size. However, the mask delivered is of a size that will not even fit a child, let alone an adult. Additionally, i think it to be of a poor quality."
4,Good mask for allergies!,"I only have two issues with this mask. First is the strong smell which was easily solved by taking out the filter and valves and washing the neoprene. Second is the fit. I must put the straps over my ears for a good seal. Wearing a hat keeps the straps from sliding down. Other than that, this is a good mask that looks cool while protecting your lungs."
2,Doesn't filter smoke.. what else is getting through?,"According to the Respro website:The Sportsta filter uses electrostatically charged fibres to attract airborne particulates down to 0.3 microns in size. 1 Micron = 1/1000mm... The Sportsta filter offers protection against: - Pollen dust; Building dust; Clay dust; Grain dust; Soya dust; Carbon dust; House dust; --->******Cigarette smoke *****<---- PM10's. e.g. Diesel smoke. - Lead & Tar.Well, I wear mine biking through beijing, and every smoker I pass gives me a big whiff of cigarette smoke. So I wonder what else it isn't filtering, as they claim?? What a waste. However, two stars instead of one because I still wear mine to block some of the dust during spring wind storms, and it seems to work slightly better than a handkerchief or cloth face mask."
2,No chance to select Size.,"Although the product is a good product, You are not able to select size. The amazon recommended company sends mediums and they just don't fit everyone. Order from the Respro Website direct, You can select sizes there and they ship immediately."
2,NOT for filtering out cigarette smells,"I had ordered the Respro Sportspa mask based on the recommendation of Respro's customer service.I asked them which mask would they recommend for me that would not allow the smell of cigarettes to come thru. They said ""Cigarette smoke is a particle, a very small sub-micron particle. The best masks for you would be either the Sportsta or the Aero Allergy mask. Both of these carry a Hepa-type filter which is used for the removal of sub-micron particulates.""I did go ahead and purchase the mask (medium) and I am a petite person. Unfortunately, I found that the mask did NOT filter out the cigarette smells. I am typically walking down the streets in NYC where people are smoking outside. Not once did this work. That is the main reason why I purchased this mask. So, if you are looking for a mask to filter out cig. smoke, I would not recommend the Respro Sportspa for that."
5,very helpful,"I love running but I have asthma, serious allergies, and live in a city with quite poor air quality. Generally in the fall and spring this combination leads to such discomfort or respiratory infections I have to stop running. On the recommendation of a friend I bought this mask and it has made a huge difference. It is great at filtering out dust and road grime especially. Also keeps the air I'm breathing warmer and moister which is great when it gets really cold. It is pretty comfortable, enough so that once I get going I stop noticing it is on. Sometimes have to reposition it, but nothing that compromises its purpose. I get lots of double takes (including police) but it is worth it.Not a cure for all my respiratory problems but definitely makes things easier and more comfortable with outdoor activities."
2,Large size too small,"Insofar as I can tell, Respro has more types of mask for more types of activities than does anyone else. I own this one, the Sportsta, and the only issue I had with it is that its ""large"" size is too small for men with larger than average sized heads (i.e., if ""one size fits all"" hats don't fit you, this mask probably won't, either). I wound up buying the one Respro mask that comes in an XL size: their model FB-1, available on the Respro site. It fits me (size 7 3/4"" head, lower face to match) pretty well, and it does a good job. It's also the only mask I can wear that doesn't interfere with the positioning of my glasses. Though like any neoprene mask, it quickly gets uncomfortable during vigourous exercise or in hot weather.On the other hand, those of you whose heads are NOT the size of basketballs will find that this model, the Sportsta, or any of the other Respro masks will do an excellent job for you.-- Ed"
2,5.5 Visco Elastic Memory Foam 1.5 inch,"Let me first say, I have been sleeping on Memory Foam for years. This foam is just OK, not the best quality. I bought this one to add some cushion to my camping bed,Hopefully it will be good enough for ocasional use. Quality Memory foam has a kind of moistness to it. I found this one to be very dry to the feel. You get what you pay for."
3,Nice!,"I bought a Visco memory foam mattress topper a couple years ago on hear for around $40, but now it looks like they've tacked on an extra $200? I don't think it's worth that much, but it is worth $40. It is very soft and comfortable. I see no difference between this product and Temperpedic except for the price and the cut. Mine was not cut straight at all, but I didn't mind for the price I paid."
4,Satisfied,We have enjoyed the added comfort this topper adds. It took a week for the foam smell to go away but now all is good!
2,Unused - but unreadable!,"Despite the strange title I have nothing but praise for the service.The problem is that the book I received is in Spanish, and I don't read Spanish!I contacted the supplier, who replied promptly, enclosing copy of the full description of this book which supported their shipment of the Spanish version.I do not recall reading one word about this order being for a Spanish translation,but we can all make mistakes.Please check and see what I ordered - I was under the impression the book I ordered was the English edition of the Revised Version of the Bible"
5,le meilleur!,"Myl√®ne Farmer est une artiste tr√®s connue en France, elle est d'ailleurs, l'une des plus pl√©biscit√©e par le public... Ce best-of qui regroupe tous les singles de la star est une pure merveille! On peut trouver dans ce double best-of, 3 in√©dits fabuleux dont le titre ""Les mots"", interpr√©t√© avec le chanteur Seal... Une des plus belle carri√®re r√©unie sur un mme disque, a vaut le coup!"
5,I give it one hundred stars if it was posible,"Hey, I was gratefully surprised whit this CDs, I think that they are the best CDs I own, and believe me, I have a lot.Reasons?????? You only have to put together all de Albums of the Glorious Mylene and lock the times. Since the first ""Maman a tort"", the extension is diferent, the version in ""Les Mots"" are LONGEST. ""pourvu quelles soint douces"" is an exclusive Remix edit, ""Sans Contrefacons"" are also longest. ""Inamoramento"" are a edit one minut shortest than the original analso ""L'historie de una fete cest"" and ON AND ON, and all the sound are REMASTERED, and sounds better than the originals. I am so hapyy, I broght it. And you?????... you really should buy it too!!!!"
2,Awful sound but some great performances,"If you are a Beefheart fanatic, you must own this disc, if only for the two opening tracks: a rivetting Click Clack and a jaw dropping a capella performance of Old Black Snake. And there are some other buried nuggets here, like the Electricity jam and a Sugar Mama that is reminiscent of Trout Mask's China Pig.But the sound, which is from audience recordings, is dreadful. The last 6 tracks from Liverpool are from a soundboard tape, but they have already been released as Merseytrout Live 1980 - why repeat them here? Surely whomever made the audience tape of the several shows represented here had more than two or three songs from each show? You don't get much for your money here. But for the die hard Beefheart fan, there isn't much choice: you need this. Novices stay away, and purchase the essentials first (Safe as Milk, Trout Mask, Lick my Decals, Clear Spot, Shiny Beast, and Doc at the Radar Station)."
5,One of the best,Duran albums. Just cancel Femme fatale that really has nothing to do with the album. All the rest is amazing.
3,Hopefully Not My Wedding Album,"I have to say that, I was totally disappointed when I heard this album first time. I was great expections because I had listened two classic tracks on this album Come Undone and Ordinary World which classics and Duran Duran's best songs ever. There are nothing else classics to find on the Wedding Album. Too Much Information and Femme Fatale are good songs. Shelter, Sin of the City and Breath After Breath are ok tracks. Rest of the songs are booring(Love Voodoo, UMF), torturing(Drowning Man,Shotgun), nasty( None of Above). I would give this album 2 stars but I'm a little bit objective and don't give two stars. Three stars is a good for this because it's hard to undertand why some people like songs like a Love Voodoo. Maybe they like also exsotic music for exemple Bolivia and Albania. All in all, This album has its good and bad moments."
3,Turbulent wedding,"I'm a great fan of these guys, but this album is like my review title: irregularForgive me.These songs are gems: Ordinary world and Come Undone at full version comparingto the ""Greatest"" compilation, Too much information (refers to the TV media)Breath after breath contains a duet between the Brazilian Milton Nascimento(singing in Portuguese)and Le Bon. Interesting,different and decent.Femme fatale and Love Voodoo are smypathetic.None of the above and Shelter are cool.These are garbage:Drowning man -> Irritating.Even listening several times,I coudn't take anything useful.UMF -> I disliked it so much at first listen that I ALWAYS press the skip button on it.To whom it may concern -> BoringSin of the city -> RepetitiveWith the exception of Liberty and Thank you I listened to all of their studio stuff.I never found so many bad songs in a Duran Duran album.This cd wasn't as I hoped.I you want their best,buy Notorious, Big Thing,Astronaut or Seven and the Ragged Tiger."
4,Breakthrough for Duran Duran,"Very original. I've had this album for 10 years and I keep coming back to it, mainly for ""Come Undone"". But Sin of the City is pretty good too. And you've gotta love the LL Cool J sample."
5,EXCELLENT!,"This was probably my second favorite CD after Notorious. It was also the LAST really good CD they put out, unfortunately. When you go messing with something that works and split up then get back then split AGAIN, people move on. Thus is the case with Duran Duran after the Wedding Album, in my opinion."
3,This isn't their first album,Please Amazon - note that your track listing is for a completely different album from your review. 'Girls on Film' was on the 1981 debut 'Duran Duran' (along with their debut single 'Planet Earth' and 'Careless Memories'). 'Ordinary World' came out 1993 on what I presume you're referring to as the 'Wedding Album'.
4,Long Time Duranie,"I've been a fan of Duran Duran since the early 80's. I've been to several of thier concerts and have all thier albums and DVDs. Simon is the apple of my eye. I agree with most of the other critics. This is a very good album and a great come-back album. But ""Drowning Man"" and ""Shotgun"" do ruin the flow of this album. But I'd like to add that ""Drowning Man"" does hurt my feelings. After all I am a U.S. citizen and I do love my country and feel that this is the best country in the world. Duran has a handful of songs putting down this country, such as ""Edge of America."" I understand that most Europeans don't like th U.S., but does Duran need to insult my love of country? I do not like political bands. I listen to music for several reasons, but not to get my political beliefs from them."
4,Time to Say 'I Do',"This album was a total surprise for me. After the disappointment of 'Liberty', I expected much of the same. But no, this album really 'kicks'. Unlike all Duran albums since RIO, which are full of fillers, this album has 11 good tracks and only 2 that are disappointing (Drowning Man & Shotgun). We all know the big hits 'Ordinary World' and 'Come Undone', but this album also contains other gems...The Milton Nascimento collaboration, ""Breath After Breath'' is fantastic and as good as anything that the Duran's have ever done....A real good album that stands the test of time and you can pick it up at a bargain price !!"
4,Happy return!,"Actually, this album has no title at all! Most of the songs are politically challenging on this album and I loved it! The sexual imagery is hot and intense, the music is classical Duran Duran. I can listen to this parts of this album over and over but there are a few songs that seem to have gotten the short-end of the creativity stick."
5,"The ORIGINAL ""must have"" New Romantic album!!!","If this album doesn`t make you understand and enjoy Duran Duran, then you never will!!! It is full of original music, and even now sounds way before it`s time. ""Girls on Film"" and ""Planet Earth"" are songs that will be forever linked to the New Romantic movement of the early 80`s and are both recognised as classic of the genre. But for me it is 3 other tracks (""Anyone out There"", ""Sound of Thunder"" and ""Friends of Mine"") that make this album unique and unmatched. Fantastic in every way!!!"
4,Great showcase of their early sound!,"this Cd is definitely great for familiarizing yourself with Duran Duran's early sound...with classics like ""Girls on Film"" and ""Is there something I should know?"" as well as the unusual-sounding ""Nightboat"", this albums proves that Duran Duran EARNED their fame! p.s. check out the song ""Sound of Thunder"" which Simon wrote about his being accepted into the band!"
5,excellent book,"An excellent book written for scorpions breeders, not for scientist.Includes all aspects from the way we choose a scorpion until conditions of captivity, breeding, diseases, etc. Photos and print quality is also excellent.Ovidiu, www.scorpioni.info"
5,Excellent Book for First-Time Scorpion Owners,"This is a terrific book that I picked up from Amazon, it covers all the bases of owning and caring for your scorpion. The more interesting aspect of the book deals with scorpions and ""stress"", which isn't to say the mental kind, but how your scorpion deals with even minor changes to its environment. That section alone is incredibly insightful, and makes for great knowledge to have when taking care of your pet.I'm by no means an expert, so I'll take the other reviewers on their word that there are some minor flaws with the book. But as a scorpion owner, I thought this was an excellent primer and a must-have book."
4,Gem of a Resource for the Beginner -Advanced,Wonderful resource for those who are looking for information on these amazing invertebrates. Basic care and important warnings about the collection and maintance of these new additions to the pet world. A resource for the beginner to the advanced .
3,The art of making wine / Stanley F. Anderson,"Very helpful book for those who are just getting started in the making of wine and a valuable tool for those who have been making wine for a while. Covers all of he basics and gives good advice for those moments when you are scratching your head saying ""now what do I do?"" or ""how did that happen?"""
4,A must have when making wine,"We have a small orchard with grapes and various fruits and wanted to make wine from the excess fruit. We contacted an extension agent we knew with this knowledge and he suggested this book. We found it to be informative and detailed. A good texted book. It helped us with the chemistry of wine making, especially when dealing with fruits other then grapes."
5,Excellent Beginning Winemaking Book,This is the best all around beginning winemaking book that I have come across! It is easy to read and understand. The principles are accurately presented in easy to understand terms. Beginning recipes are given using concentrates and fruit. Equipment use is explained. A glossary is included.
5,Art of Making Wine,"I have used the receipt for bluberry wine for 3 years with one exception: I use 3 lbs of frozen , wild bluberries and 3 large contaners of frozen white grape (skip the raisens) concentrate and have made the best red wine in years,,,, similar to MERLOT but with outstanding color and flavor."
1,Watch out,"I am a professor who has been using computers for about 25 years. I bought Disk Purge because it was the least expensive. They don't mention that using it on older models, one has to create a floppy boot disk. During this process bad things can happen. In the case of my laptop, the computer shut down and subsequently will only power up for about 5 seconds. Tabernus tech support did the predicable; it was my computer, it was the battery, but it could not possibly be there wonderful software. Buyer beware!"
1,horrible,"This is a total piece of crap. I kept getting a 'reboot error' message, when I emailed the Tabernus people I got a canned response that was totally irrelevant. Good luck trying to call if you run into any problems...ended up charging the whole thing back and throwing this piece of s..t away."
3,"It wipes your hard drive clean, but...","It wipes your hard drive clean, but if you never used a computer without the assistance of an operating system, you have a learning experience ahead of you. The supplied instructions are inadequate. You need the maker's online explanations to get the job done. So, unless you have another computer available, get the online info before you start using the hardware."
2,"Horrible Soundtrack, Blah Scenery",This did not look HD to me. The mts are in the distance so all you see is white. It's hard for me to even write a review on the scenery because its so unremarkable. The music is really bad and there is no option for nature sounds like other dvds of this kind. I'm returning this one tommorow.
4,So realistic,This is a great handbook for any working women. I have found it to be very realistic and practical. The short stories shared at the beginning of each chapter add humor and realism to the book. I bought this book for myself and plan to buy it for other friends and family.
1,Common sense,"I found this book to be common sense (i.e. don't talk badly about the person you just video conferenced with right in front of the video device because it might still be on, don't wear bright eyeshadow to a conservative job, say thank you, etc). This book would be beneficial to someone living in a cave or someone who just wasn't taught any better.All of the typos in this book made my head spin and made it seem even more juvenile."
4,I love this book.....,"If you want a book that explains how to use Window Sockets, TCP/IP, developing a Game Lobby and not mention the awesome MySql section for storing user info then this book is for you. Learning Direct Play was cool but I wanted more on socket programming so if you want to get your hands dirty and see what's going on for your self then buy this book. I sat in the book store first because I got burned by another book and I tell you before I got to the last chapter as I skimmed through it I was sold! The book is a gem and the author's explanations are clear and consise you will be up to speed in no time."
1,outdated,"The information inside may be good, but you can't get past the outdated language and pictures. I wish I had saved my money."
3,Expensive For What You Get,"While this book is full of useful, interesting information on identifying problems, it does not explain how to handle problems. Amazon should bundle at least three of these books for that price."
5,The Gesell Institute Child Development Series,"Your Three-Year-Old: Friend or EnemyAll of the books in this series should be in each parent's library. I used them to help me understand my children (1979, 1982, 1983) and have purchased copies for my own daughter. We are also educators in our family and think that early childhood and elementary school teachers would find this series very useful. The books are clearly written and describe the norms simply but eloquently. The books are easy reads.I received my series in superb condition - hardly even looked used. Thanks to Amazon and its re-sellers for excellent service and keeping me informed of the progress of my order."
5,"White, but open minded....","I just ordered this book in hopes of educating myself on the African American struggle. I have not received the book as of yet, but want to encourage other white American's to open their minds in hopes that together we can overcome racial disparities. krastonscott@hotmail.com"
4,Book for my class,The book came in time for my class. The price was very good. I will not be able to rate it now until after my class.
4,Technique That Transcends Time,"I am aware of what the late historian E. P. Thompson meant by the condescension with which we tend to regard the past. I don't know what I was expecting when I bought this album, other than a document of an earlier day, but I was quickly put in my place. The Flonzaley are not merely one of the first string quartets to make a living playing music, they are amazing technicians and their artistry is impressive. These are notable performances. While the sound is not stellar, it is surprisingly decent and I have relished listening to these pieces as they flashed by, played with enthusiasm, passion and dash. If only some of the modern ensembles that pride themselves on fleetness of finger were as committed to the music as these artists."
4,great album,"used to listen to ime over a decade ago. was happy to find album. dont know who came first, but ime has similar sound as janes addiction. if u like that kind of music, try ime. happy i bought it."
5,One of the best rock cd,"I am way too late in writing a review for this cd, but if you can find this cd, order it. This cd was IME's best. The singing, musicianship and song compositions are awesome. I always hear new elements in the songs everytime I listen. The band rocks in a way Red Hot Chili Peppers mixed with Soundgarden would - but that is a bad analogy. They are just enough jam/progressive without being overkill.* * * * * 5 Stars"
2,Children's Book,"This is a children's book about Larry Ellison. The hard cover is thicker than the 80 pages contained within. If you want a few hour read to get some info about an amazing and interesting man, you've found it. If you want any depth at all, go elsewhere."
4,"Great video, lousy audio","This set of videos is great. He brings the artists to life and gives us a better understanding of their character and the context in which they created their work. However, the audio quality is poor. The volume level will go from good to bad often enough to be distracting."
3,NOT FOR CHILDREN!!!,"I bought this after having seen Schama's History of Britian. I didn't expect a carbon copy of that format on art history and was open to what take he would have on some famous artists. I was impressed with the photography & many of his impressions & ideas. I was not previously familiar with Bernini & was blown away by his sculpture. I had hoped to share this whole series with my 12 year old daughter who loves art. I let her see the segment on Rembrandt, but I was shocked when we were viewing the segment on Turner & without warning a fully nude lady popped onto the screen! I was equally shocked on the VanGogh segment when the ""F"" word was used multiple times! There are some great moments in the series, but parents, please preview beforehand!!!"
3,Not your standard art DVD,The Power of Art is a trmemdous collection where Simon Schama tells us not only about the art but the many backgrounds of the artist. He sems to be more of a historian than an art critic.. The DVD's are full of little known historical evidence about the times the art was made and the artist
2,Mark Rothko Sucks,"Even without the ridiculous praise that Schama heaps on Mark Rothko, I wouldn't give this series more than three stars. Yes, art is VERY IMPORTANT, but the lengths to which Schama goes to equate the art with the artist are as ridiculous as Rothko's reputation. I SUPPOSE David was a bad man, but his work was good. If Schama had his way, every time you look at a David painting you'll see nothing but evil. But more than anything else, it's the Mark Rothko section that made me sick. I was having a good time, when all of a sudden he starts praising Rothko. People, it's blobs of color. Blobs of boring, ugly color. It's overrated puke.Oh, and the extended take on the obvious sexual imagery in the statue of St. Theresa is a little over the top. Enough already. Yes, it's sexual, but it's also deeply religious. Maybe, just maybe, she really was feeling something spiritual and maybe, just maybe, the artist intended to convey that and not an orgasm. Go back to cutting up chickens, Schama."
4,Great for beginners,"I recently wrote my first review on Amazon which of course compelled me to add some more. Not long ago I bought these series and I have to say they are great. I am an artist myself and it is always nice to be reminded of the great ones, in ""plain English"". Simon makes things interesting, if not perhaps a little overly dramatic, but this does add the entertainment factor. I think that the information is good, and well presented, and that if you have had none or almost no exposure to any of these artists, this is certainly a good way to start.All in all, I enjoyed it, but would have liked something a little more thorough (but that's because I have years of art school behind me). If you want to get started or just add a some more to what you already know, buy this product, you won't be disappointed."
5,Evocative Interpretation of Art and History,"You don't have to be a painter or Art-Historian to apreciate the beauty ofSymon Shama's Power of ART. IT iS a sheer delight visually and of the mind.I have seen and admired Mr. Shama's previous work (the British History serie),and I think of him as one of the most evocative interpreter of history -and now-surprise, of art."
5,Excellent DVD by Simon Schama's..,Excellent DVD in which I enjoy all the chapters regarding the history of art. He is a brilliant expert that brings to life the greatest painter with such a passion and dedication. I well-worthed purchased in my opinion.
5,In Praise Of Art On Vi deo,"Simon Schama's Power of Art is brilliant and a must have addition for any home.Not only will adults find it both fun and factual I suspect that it would be a painless introduction to the world of art of teen agers.Mr. Schama is an amazing art historian and I constantly found myself saying ""I didn't know that."""
5,Absolutely incredible,This DVD collection is incredible!!! Schama presents some of the most moving and visually stunning art work in history to life in a captivating and thorougly enjoyable manner. The actors used make you feel like you are watching history unfold (the actor who portrayed Van Gogh was fantabulous). A must for anyone with even a passing interest in art.
5,Stunning Visuals and Cultivated Commentary on the Stellar Eight of Art,"What a Steal: EIGHT HOURS of Film...covering the genesis of each artist, their work,and their pain (usually),their gift to humanity ...and all framed in the spoken, rich tapestry of Schama.(Am still trying to decode the abstract Rothko.)Power of Art is Excellent for those who understand Art, and for those who wonder what the big deal is about color on canvas. (I assume no one breathing would wonder about Bernini and his sculptures.)Which is superior: the 60 minutes of Film on EACH artist, orLord Schama's commentary. (Simon Schama deserves this special designation: he does not so much as speak, but rather weaves a luscious verbal backdrop.)The Visuals are an elegant movie on their own.Friends came over to watch the first Artist in series: the Renaissance bad boy Caravaggio. There is now a wait list to Borrow my set of Power of Art. (Am urging all to buy their own! I keep going back for second and third and fourth viewings.)"
4,Art made interesting,"Simon Schama has a very easy, stylized and seductive way of making the art and artists he talks about interesting, educational and fun. He explains the meaning behind the art, what the artist was thinking and how the times and culture influenced what we are seeing. Mr. Schuma has picked some very stiring pieces to dicuss and artists whose rebelion and temper you are able to really feel thru his wonderful oral presentation and spectacular melding of the actual art work with dramatic historical re-enactments. I'm not sure why I only gave 4 vs 5 stars, I guess I'm hoping for a next series and that it's even better then the first."
5,entertaining and still educational,"A lot of art historians don't like Simon Schama because he plays up the drama and downplays the historical facts. Personally, that's exactly why I loved this series! Schama and his producers did a great job of making these artists come to life by giving us an emotional connection to these long-dead people who lived in a world we hardly recognize. Art history can be a snooze-fest, which is such a shame because boring material makes it hard to understand why art history is important. Fortunately, these DVDs are entertaining, thought provoking, and fascinating -- enough to make you appreciate the great artists of the past and how art influences our lives today."
4,History of Classical Visual Art Works,"Simon Schama, and internationally recognised historian, has presented a fascinating account of the creation of the works of 8 classical sculptors and painters : Garavaggio, Bernini, Rembrant, David, Turner, Van Gogh, Picasso and Rothko, in the context of the historical and social enviroment of their day. As is stated on the cover, this is no sleepy walk through some Art Gallery on a Sunday afternoon and requires concentration and repeated viewing to come to terms with what Schama is telling us. I can recommend it highly and am grateful to Amazon for making it available to us in New Zealand. My only negative comment is that the disc is formatted for the American market so that you need a multi-zone formatted DVD player to view it."
5,Powerful Art,"A must own for art lovers, this series is a love song to art in general and a spectacular deep dive into the life and times of eight undisputed masterpieces. Schama's depth of knowlege and genuine passion for his subjects is infectious. The production values are top notch and the presentation highly entertaining. This is the best art series since ""Shock of the New"" from Robert Hughes."
3,Check your Vac model first,"I'm not sure why I needed to modify this to fit. Same shape, but had an extra ring that I needed to cut with a blade. It would be good if the filter P/N was written on the old one."
2,Not the complete product!,"The complete product as pictured on this page and on the venders page was not shipped, twice! My dust buster will not work with just the filter, I need both parts as pictured. I need the filter AND the plastic cover for the filter in order for my dust buster to work. Please send me the complete part or at least the plastic cover as pictured, I will be glad to pay any reasonable price for the plastic cover, as I have paid the vender in the past and not received the complete part."
5,Satisfied,Black & Decker PVF100 Replacement Filter for PHV100/PHV1800 18-Volt Pivoting VacNot much to say other then it fit perfect and it was shipped fairly quickly. Would buy again from Amazon.
2,PVF100 Review,My husband had purchased these same filters for a similair price and received triple the quantity. I thought I had ordered 12 as well and when I received was exceedingly disappointed to only had gotten a quantity of 2. filters.
2,Doesn't fit,"It's the same filter as the old one,EXCEPT, the plastic base is bigger. The plastic filter lock won't fit into the vacuum like it should."
5,Black and Decker Has Finally Gotten it Right,"Ordered the PVh100 Pivoting Vac with reservations. Have been burned over the years with Dustbuster models.But B&D; has gotten it right this time. I have sucked up broken glass, dirt, dust, dead insects and gunk from nasty PCs brought in for repair. It has worked every time!Worth the money in my opinion. Only thing I think they could improve on is to provide, even for optional purchase, a longer, slimmer pickup arm attachment so you can get into tight places easier."
4,It's great!,I've had several cordless vacuums before and this is by far the best. Have two dogs in the house and it's great on picking up the dog hair. Also works very good on rugs and carpet. A little akward to empty the container at first.
1,WARNING to Pivoting Floor Vac users...WRONG FILTER,"This is automatically suggested when you buy the PSV1800. NOTE that this only works with the PHV1800, not the PSV1800 floor vac. You need the PVF200 model filter, not the PVF100.Please do not make snide comments here...I trusted Amazon to suggest the right filter, they did not, so I have a useless PVF100."
3,necessary evil,"This is a filter for a product that has to have it. The necessary evil is that B&D actually want me to replace this every whatever. Not necessary. Just clean it out. Otherwise, the money paid for new filters will rack up to over the price of the hand vacuum."
3,Black & Decker filter,"Black-N-Decker Household Filter, Vacuum, For BLD CHV9600, WhiteToo expensive; doesn't last long enough; gets dirty quickly and has to be changed/cleaned too often.Does do good job of cleaning/filtering."
1,Grady's rips you off.,"I ordered this product because the description shows my hand vac model. However, the filters are not correct for my unit. Since they were not, I sent them back to Grady's with a note to please refund my purchase. However, they have not contacted me and I am still out the money. This is not a trustworthy company."
2,I would not highly suggest this book!!!!!!,"The Burning Questions of Bingo Brown is not one of my favorite books.I was forced to READ IT IN 6th GRADE,I think they should read this book in about 2nd or 3rd grade if you ask me for my opinion!!!It might be a good book for 2nd or 3rd graders to read.If your going to buy a book off of amazon either get From the Earth to the Moon or (when all of the books of Harry Potter come out)all of the Harry Potter books!!!"
3,doesn't meet Daniela standards,"For me, Daniela Mercury is perhaps the greatest female voice of all time. Her music defines the words fun and joyfulness ( I prefer the Portuguese word alegria). However, this album disappoints. It seems she has fallen to the Brazilian female singer curse. Producers have pushed her into electronic, over produced music, instead of staying true to her roots. This CD isn't awful, but it just isn't the quality that one is used to from Daniela. You'd be better off buying Feijo com Arroz. I just hope this is a one CD aberration."
5,"Hot, Fun, Sexy, Infectous, & Wonderful!","I recently saw a Daniela Mercury video on World Link TV and was hooked by her music immediately. I now own three of her CDs and want more more more. At a recent dinner party my wife and I had in Houston, I shared Daniela's music with a percusionist who performs with the Houston Ballet. He loved it as much as I do and other people felt the same. I now need a daily fix of Daniela to brighten my day. I would highly recommend the last 3 or 4 of her lastest CDs. I wish there was a DVD of her videos available as well."
4,The Roman Invasions of Britain,This is a well made dvd about the roman invasions and the struggles of the britains. It covers allot of what tactics the romans used and the weaknesses of the britains. I just wish it was a longer dvd.
4,The Eternal Plato,This volume is not of the best quality construction but it has a ton of Plato for a very reasonable price. Though this book is not made to last years of usage it is a great source material for Plato's works translated by an able scholar.Good buy!
4,"well made, could use more features","i agree with the other reviewers that this unit is well-made, particularly for the price. unfortunately mine arrived just AFTER a winter storm, so i haven't gotten to try it out in actual rain yet.i was disappointed by some of the features. i didn't realize the thermometer is indoor only, and the clock needs to be set manually. i have other oregon scientific weather goodies (BAR898HGA), with a radio clock and outdoor thermometer so i just ""assumed"" this would have one too.also, oregon scientific could use a new industrial designer. this product looks very retro, but i don't think that was on purpose!"
1,Oregon Scientific Cable-Free Range Guage,"It worked great for about 8 months, then it died. Replaced all the batteries still nothing So I'm doing an experiment to see if the out-door unit is biodegradable. Don't waste your money or time to install it."
4,Great Rain Gauge,I first purchased one last Christmas as a gift for a firend. He enjoyed it so much I ended up buying a 3 more (one for me and 2 for family). They work very well and the range is great. It could be better if it had the outside temperature built into it as well.
4,Oregon Scientific Consistent,"Works like you would expect for a product from Oregon Scientific. Don't bother reading the instructions, co what I did and read the user comments on how to operate it. Their instructions are wordy and vague. Works very reliably, but don't expect it to measure very light rain or drizzle. These will not register."
5,Oregon Scientific Cable-Free Long-Range Rain Guage,Very accurate... nice to be able to see how much rainfall without even going outside. Very clever!!
5,chuck,It was a gift so I don't have personal experience. The delivery was excellent and condition of arrival was excellent.
4,Oregon Sci. Rain Gauge,"I was very impressed with the product itself, very high quality for such a good price. I found it to be very accurate. But the one thing taking away the 5th star is it's sad manual. I've never seen anything like it. Please read all the reviews on the website about how to set it up instead of trying to do what the manual says to do, the manual will only make you extremely frustrated. Not thinking about the manual issues, a great buy!"
4,Very Useful Tool,I've owned and used this rain gauge for over a year with no problems. It features a mesh shield to keep trash out of measuring unit. Very accurate if positioned properly. Batteries are a bit difficult to replace. Inside unit needs a backlight.A quality instrument.
2,Very unreliable,"I have had this unit for 2 years. It works pretty good until it rains hard. The inside unit will lose the signal from the outside unit. It will not be able to pick it up again until a day or so after the rain stops, no matter how many times I tell the indoor unit to search for the outdoor unit. I guess that in heavy rain, the insides get wet (circuit board is exposed to the inside of the unit, and there is water in there!) and the unit does not transmit reliably. After it dries out inside, it goes back to working. Comments about hard to install batteries and terrible manual are accurate as well.So, if you can use a rain gauge that measures light rains well, this is it. But for the occasional thunderstorm? You just have to be satisfied knowing that it is raining, you won't know how much."
4,Good product - accurate rain gauge,"I purchased this product a couple of months ago and have been very happy with it.Pros:-Rain gauge is accurate (I confirmed it's accuracy by comparing it's totals with other manual gauges - they were all within 5% for each of the three storms that I checked).-Easy to set up.Cons:-Changing the batteries in the rain gauge is alot of work (make sure that you don't loose the very small screws).-Barometer displayed weather prediction is not very useful.If you want an inexpesive wireless rain gauge, this is a great product."
1,instructions???,"Oh wow...I consider myself very savvy with electronic items but the instructions that come with this item leave me wondering, uh, now what? After clicking with a bunch of buttons, I still have no idea what I'm doing and the gauge doesn't work. The unit looks very nice...but I don't know how to work it. Too bad, Oregon Scientific. You guys should spend a little money on your instructions. I'll be sending this back."
3,Oregon Scientific Rain Gauge,"Unit appears to read on the low side, only was able to check it out twice. No on/off switch on the unit, so during times of no rain, common in Phoenix, the batteries will probably good bad. Very difficult to change batteries in the outdoor unit. Must disassemble, about 10, 12 screws. Very small and hard to handle. In the future I would look for a unit which could be turned off."
3,Challenging Product,"The directions for this item were obviously written in China or Japan. It comeswith batteries installed, but one must remove a plastic protective device first. Directions don't tell this. Then one must remove numerous tiny screws to access the battery chamber.The outer cover has tiny screws also, but of a different size than those inside, necessitating the use of two different sized small phillips screw drivers. We hadto use tweezers to re-install some screws. Once set up the product did perform well."
3,Oregon Scientific wireless rain gauge,"The rain gauge works wonderfully, once you get programmed and running. The directions are sketchy and incomplete. I had to search the web site for ideas on getting the rain gauge reset, after giving up with being on hold with the Customer Service number. Hint: There is a reset button near the batteries in the rain collector."
3,Not accurate in spite of careful leveling.,I received this rain Gauge as a gift and am enjoying the challenge of calibrating it to acchieve results that are simular to my manual gauge purchased at Wal Mart. The manual gauge is anchored a few feet from the Oregon Scientific Cable-Free Long-Range Rain Gauge. The Oregon Scientific reads +/-0.25in low for each inch in the manual unit.I have reached comparable results after much trial and error in placing styrofoam displacers in the back of the two flip cups and driping an exact measurement of water through it. I found a straight walled container with an exact diameter of the Cable-Free units opening in which to measure the water.
5,Great CD!,"The entire album has great club music, even the slower songs make you feel like getting up to dance, no matter where you are!There isn't a song I don't like on this album, and that doesn't happen very often! Way to Go Cher!"
5,THE BEST OF HER CAREER!!!REALY!!!,"I was very doubtful that Cher could do any better than her previous album 'Believe', however this album is perhaps her greatest musical accomplishment to date. 'Living Proof' is much more focused and cohesive than 'Believe'. This album is loaded with [great] dance anthems that are sure to take any listener onto the dancefloor!! This album will not diapoint any Cher fan!!Buy it, its awesome!!!!"
2,Her Voice Is Great,"But the silly Dance/Rave/Disco ""drum machine"" sounding music takes away from her magnificent voice, kinda like puting twice pipes, dingo balls & hydraulics on a Ferrari."
3,Eh...,Nothing to write home about...I don't think I've listened to this CD more than once. It's just kind of ho-hum. She needs to go back to the electronic-less music she did before. She has a great voice but it's been synthesized too much!
4,a formula that works for cher,"the song ""believe"" really got me hooked on ""disco"" Cher.let's hope she keeps this style (as found on believe and living proof) from here on out. it really works for her!hightlights:""song for the lonely""""different kind of love song"" (my favorite!)""alive again""""the music's no good without you""""love is a lonely place without you""and ""when the money's gone"" (this one is a bit overdone though)songs that could have been left out:""rain, rain"" and ""body to body, heart to heart""PURE FILLER! these two songs are a poor attempt at r&b;/pop.stick with the dance cuts!"
4,overall good,"i like the overall sound. i mainly bought the cd for ""this is a song for the lonely."" but the other songs are consistently good with similar sound as well."
4,The Queen of Pop,"I have to admit I am still listening to the British version of Cher's grossly underrated ""It's A Man's World,"" while ""Believe"" despite its stick-in-your-brain ear-candy smash single was, to this listener, a fairly generic forgettable album and a vast letdown. ""Living Proof"" is a far more cohesive CD than its predecessor. Though I'm still not partial to its Euro-techno thump-thump production, most of these songs are undeniable pop perfection -- and in the case of ""Song for the Lonely"" and ""Rain Rain"" there's even emotional depth. This album certainly will be a smash, and single after single will blare from the radio and shops and car windows for the rest of the year. If not exactly a testament to the great pop singer Cher has become, and the range of material she can pull off, it is still a record that hits the bullseye on the pop culture meter. Let the guilty pleasures begin."
5,THIS IS THE BEST CD EVER,"I love this C.D. it is ten times better than believe. If you like to boogie woogie than by this C.D.My favorit Songs are in this order*Love is a lonely place without you*song for the lonely*The music's no good without you*when you walk away*Aive again*when the money's gone*Love so high*rain,rain*body to body, heart to heart*REal love*love one another"
5,Great Album.....Chers Best to date,This is a great album and I would have to say Cher's best to date. Song for the lonely makes you reflect while Alive Again inspires you and When you walk away makes you want to dance.Cher is like a fine wine she improves with age!
4,Cher Is Back and there are no dissapointments!,"Cher returns to the commercial world after a year plus hiatis and every minute we waited was well worth it because of her latest release ""Living Proof"". This album rocks! With the lead single ""This Is A (Song For the Lonely)"" playing on VH1 and radio stations across the nation, Cher has jumped back into the spotlight and I for one couldn't be happier! ""Living Proof"" is FULL of great songs including the first UK release, ""The Music's No Good Without You"", along with the other's like ""A Different Kind of Love Song"", ""Alive Again"", ""Real Love"", ""Love So High"", and others. The album is awesome and I recommend it for everyone's record collection.Joey"
5,"Cher tops ""Believe"" with ""Living Proof""","Anyone who thought ""Believe"" was a fluke will be totally sold when they get ""Living Proof"". It is an amazing collection of dance songs with ""(This Is) A Song for the Lonely"" topping them all. This is the first single in the US and second single internationally and it is one of the best songs I've ever heard. This is definitely a CD that will be in my player for months to come. I also bought 34 copies for XMas gifts this year :-)."
5,Cher's back in great style!!! Brazil loves Cher!,"I really got stonished when i knew that Cher's new album would be released in Brazil so soon! And did not think twice. Got it immediately. And I can tell that it went over my expectations. My new year's party was sounded by it! The cd is great. Some songs are the highlight like ""when the money's gone"". If you enjoyed the ""believe"" album, get this one now!Hope you guys have fun!Do you believe in live after love?????"
5,I'D GIVE THIS 15 STARS IF POSSIBLE,"Cher has given us some unforgettable hits like DARK LADY, GYPSIES, TRAMPS AND THIEVES, HALF-BREED, IF I COULD TURN BACK TIME, LOVE & UNDERSTANDING, BELIEVE AND STRONG ENOUGH. But just when you thought it was safe to assume that ""Believe"" was her best, here comes ""Living Proof"". ""Believe"" was her foray into the dance scene; ""Living Proof"" is her ""concrete"" into the dance world.When I first heard about this cd I was excited to hear that she decided to try her hand again at dance music. Who knew that she could top ""Believe"". But we are talking about Cher; the woman who believes she can rule the world...and she has.This cd ranks up there with such cds as: anything with house/club music, Jamiroquai's A FUNK ODYSSEY and Gloria Estefan's GLORIA!If you love Cher; or if you love dance music; or you love Cher and dance music...get this cd NOW!!!"
4,"NEW YORK POSTS REVEIW ""LIVING PROOF""","THERE ARE THREE HITS ON THIS CD. MUSIC'S NO GOOD WITHOUT YOU, SONG FOR THE LONELY, AND WHEN THE MONEY'S GONE.There are four really good songs on this cd, the above three and YOU TAKE IT ALL.Cher sounds really good with the exception of too much vocorder on her voice. I like this album much more that Believe.However there are some really truly TERRIBLE songs included here. Who knows why she had to include them? I am hoping that she didn't pick them herself. Body to Body...wew!!! Mike Tyson could have written better...sounds like a child wrote it putting together every cliche known to bad songwriters.The other travesty is Love One Another. Billy Steinberg, Rick Knowles, Marie Cremers...GIVE IT UP. All three of you wrote this embarrasment??Cher however overcomes these ugly bumps in the road and accomplishes a work to be proud of. Cher please you don't have to give people song slots on your precious cd's because they were lucky for you in the past. You are too good."
5,"TheMusic'sNoGoodWithoutYouCHER,SoDon'tRetire","I just got back from Vegas and saw Cher's FANTASTIC show at the MGM.The legend told the audience she's retiring after this album,and we all booed.Its ashame,because the Women is looking and sounding better than ever,especially on ""Living Proof."" The first single,""Song for the lonely,"" is beutifull,and has helped alot of us after 9-11.My other favorites,""The Music's no good without you,and the last cut,""When the money's gone,"" but the entire album is a Wonderfull DANCE CD,even better than ""Believe.""After being a RockStar,TV Star,Movie Star,and the Top Pop Star to close the Century,She deserves to Retire,but ""The Music's no good without CHER"
2,Not as good as her other albums,I thought this would just be another good Cher Album. I was disappointed when it was not the same type of music I was accustomed to with Cher.
5,HERE'S LIVING PROOF!,"Cher has done it again! She is back with a beat and a heart. This is Cher's finest. All the tracks on ""Living Proof"" are keepers. There is no throw backs on this one. Cher is ""Living Proof"", that she still has ""It""!"
3,Living Proof is half and Half,"Living Proof by Cher has alot of great songs such as When You Walk Away,This Is A Song For The Lonely.....but if you are not into the overly used computerized vocals then there are 3 songs you will not enjoy such as The Musics No Good Without You,Real Love and Different Kind of Love Song...This album has a little bit for every one.....Such as the people into special Effects and the ones that buy a cd just to hear the artist singing...and not into a artists vocals ruiend by Special effects....my suggestion is to buy the cd and make your own judgement."
4,The Music's No Good Without Cher.,"When you have a hit as monstrous as the disco-tinged ""Believe,"" do you even dare change the formula, even slightly? Cher doesn't, and that's not a bad thing on ""Living Proof."" As with her last record, the diva gives us a platter of energetic dance tunes that may not be as memorable as ""Believe,"" but are catchy enough to find a home in both the radio and the clubs. I wasn't totally wild about the first single ""Song for the Lonely,"" a 9/11 tribute that sounds less sincere than opportunistic. She fares way better on ""A Different Kind of Love Song,"" ""The Music's No Good Without You,"" and the bouncy ""When the Money's Gone."" But ""Living Proof""'s best track is the discocentric ""Love Is a Lonely Place Without You,"" a really good post-breakup song that's given justice thanks to Cher's distinguished delivery. On her last album, Cher asked us to ""believe."" This time around, she's given us the ""living proof"" to show that our faith wasn't in vain."
5,THIS IS HER BEST WORK EVER!!!!,"This is definitely Cher's best work ever and is much better than Believe. It definitely didn't get the attention it deserved, probably because radio refused to play any of the singles. It's a shame because there are some GREAT tracks. ""The Music's No Good Without You"" is one of her best tracks ever and definitely is cutting edge. It's unlike anything you've ever heard. Cher's voice is vocoded as with Believe, but it is backed with a futuristic and haunting electronic beat. ""Alive Again"" and ""Different Kind of Love Song"" are great. ""Love Is A Lonely Place Without You"" is a haunting slow electronic track. ""Rain Rain"" lets you hear Cher's R&B side and the result is a great slow song.Two words- BUY IT!!!"
1,buy a different book,"the book is outdated and some trailheads don't exist anymore. you spend more time looking for trail heads on some of the trails that the authors seemed to have invented themselves. While there are good trail descriptions, don't depend on the hand drawn maps to get you by or to even be correct all of the time. invest in something more up to date and avoid this book for the time being."
2,Information Sketchy at Best,"We tired to use this book on some recent hikes in S Illinois. The maps are very poor, information given is pretty brief and is basically the same as what the National Forest and State Parks give out. This could have been a great book but it's mediocre at best."
3,"Pretty, but adequate","Very sleek looking clock but a few problems: The LED display on the face is not very bright and very difficult to see during the daytime (at night it is impossible to see the time unless you click the button to light it up for a few seconds), it is too easy to turn the alarm on/off by mistake since the buttons are flat.As mentioned in another review, you can project the time (in red digits) but only on the ceiling. On the wall, the time is displayed backwards. One thing I like about the clock is the alarm. It is a loud beep that goes off in intervals (the beeps move closer together until it goes off completely) ...Overall, I think it is a very nice-looking clock that works adequately."
2,A bit disappointed...,"I bought this clock for the projection feature, but was pretty dismayed to find that the projection is so faint, that the room needs to be in pitch darkness in order to see the time. Since our blinds let in some light, by 6:30 AM, it is almost impossible to see the time.Also, the ""Radio Controlled"" atomic clock setting doesn't seem to be received in NYC. It just shows the ""No Reception"" symbol, so you have to set the time yourself. So much for the ""ExactSet"" functionality...And, oddly enough, the images show the clock as being black, but the one I received is silver."
3,RAW COURAGE FORMATING,It was not done in SP Format. It was recorded in Extra Play Format. It would have been a higher quality recording if recorded in SP Format.
1,Raw Crap,"I gave this movie one star because there is nothing lower. The movie is standing joke in my family as the worst movie ever made. It ranks down there with Carnisaur, but worse. I would buy a copy if in DVD just as a joke to play on my kids. You owe it to yourself to see the worst movie ever made. Laughably bad!"
4,good,i think this is not as good as other battleground series..but definitely better than most on offer.i rate it a B +
3,old town,"I heard OLD TOWN for the first time performed by the Corrs and I loved it. Then, one day, I heard it on my car-radio, performed by Philip Lynott. What fantastic song what a fantastic performers. (can anyone help me with finding a CORRS 2000 calender ?)"
4,funky bros johnson,great to see and enjoy these guys after so many years - footage not bad and audio surprisingly better than anticipated
5,Byrd will take you to the skies!,"DONALD BYRD is truly a music-master. He has done numerous great albums over the years. This CD is undoubtedly one of the best ways to appreciate the 'Godfather of JazzFunk'. Not only is this disc packed with cool, funky and deep timeless trax (buy this disc and it will never go out of date), it also provides the blue-print for future jazz and dance-orientated music. In other words, THE BOMB! The majority of the tracks are produced by the wizard-like production duo the MIZELL BROTHERS, who are responsible for JOHNNY HAMMOND's and BOBBI HUMPHREY's best material. The collection of tracks will move your body (eg. CHANGE, DOMINOES) as well as your soul (WIND PARADE, YOU AND THE MUSIC, LANASANA'S PRIESTESS). Which is why you can't fail. I'd put this disc up there will the best of my Soul/Jazz/Funk collection, and believe me my collection is big."
4,Revisiting Pop Jazz of the 1970s,"Dr. Donald Byrd was one of the early crossover/smooth jazz artists. This album shows how forward thinking he was within that style so many years before Kenny G., et al. He (Dr. Byrd) knew that blending an r & b feel with a distinct jazz sensibility had lots of potential. This album has good stuff, both musically and historically."
2,Not what I expected,"If you are looking for a contemporary cd of jazz/funk or jazz /rock, this isnt.This whole album sounds more like elevator music or disco. If that is what you are after, go ahead and buy it"
4,Memories,"I think this is the same dvd I have,titled Harold Melvin's Blue Notes live in concert.All tho Harold is no longer with us,the group does a nice job of carring on the soulfull sound. Some of the songs,If YOU DON'T KNOW ME BY NOW,THE LOVE I LOST,I MISS YOU,WAKE UP EVERBODY.Sharon Page doing I HOPE WE CAN BE TOGETHER SOON.(not in very good voice). Just to name a few. I realy enjoy it."
2,Very disappointing!,"I have a large collection of concert dvd's and none are such a poor quality. This is on a par with an amateur video.I was a huge fan of Harold Melvin and his replacement does not do him justice. I bought the Ojays DVD at the same time. No comparison!It's obvious there was no investment in this production. Sad!And by the way, Harold Melvin had passed when this was made. Yet I have seen some advertise he is part of this DVD. Extremely misleading!"
2,"Good artists, bad registration","I love how they carry on the work of the legandary group. But the camerawork is that poor, that it's starts to get on your nberves, if you look longer than 10 minutes. Couldnt they get a cameraman with a steady hand. These shots make the dvd almost impossible. A shame, because it van be done so much better. The artists do their best....."
5,Great Documentary!,"Love this DVD, great gift for any shooter! This DVD tells the amazing stories/re-enactment of the long range shots that formed our history!Thanks!"
3,Fool's garden review,"Just one excelent song (lemon tree), one good song, and the rest just for passing time. I probably loock for another record of Fools garden to realice if the got improve with time."
4,365 Eloquent Quotes,"Besides authoring the Declaration of Independence, serving as our third president, and founding a university, Thomas Jefferson said a lot of intelligent things, and 365 of the most eloquent and quotable are collected here. My only beef with this book is the organization of the quotes, which is for some reason ""a saying per day"" (e.g. May 6), when there is no hint that he made the statement on that day, or that there is any connection at all between the day and the quote. If it were a calendar pad with tear-off sheets, that would make more sense. In any event, the index enables you to find quotes by subject, and you may find yourself reading through the entire list, marking your favorites for later."
2,Basic skills,"Ned is an animal and one of our sports legends. While the basic info is helpful for beginners it is strikingly limited for anybody but the person just starting out. Personally I felt the title was misleading, particularly when I purchased it for $21."
5,Plug in for your software...,"This program has nice transitions which you can access - and be able to use it - within those softwares:Adobe Premiere 6.0;6.5 and ProUlead MediaStudio Pro 6.0;6.5 and 7.0Ulead VideoStudio 5.0;6.0 and 7.0Canopus Let's Edit, Ezedit and Raptor Edit.Canopus VideoFX will expand your software's transitions!Portuguese: Este programa tem transicoes legais, as quaispodem ser acessadas - e ser capaz de usa-las - atraves desses softwares ( que mencionei acima).Canopus VideoFX ira expandir as transicoes de seu software!"
2,Thank goodness these cd's have improved with time,"This collection of holiday tunes by Broadway casts is a fine cd, but over the years these collections have gotten much better. The cd for 2001 is just a 1 cd set with 16 songs. There are 2 different versions of Oh Christmas Tree, which seems unnecessary and none of the other songs stands out as a classic. The best arrangement is by far, the Blast version of Carol of the Bells."
4,"Excellent ""easy"" history","Wood is best known as a BBC ""presenter"" of the PBS variety, but he's also an Oxford-trained historian. His books (and television series) are solid history but still accessible. This book and his <I>Domesday: A Search for the Roots of England</I> are almost two halves of a whole, an investigation of what happened in England between the departure of the legions and the arrival of William's Normans, and why, and what the effects were on the further development of the ""English"" (. . . Celtic, Danish, Norwegian, Norman French . . .) people. Lots of maps and illustrations, lots of archaeological plats, and a nice turn of phrase in nearly every paragraph."
4,Time for some light,"An excellent book, exploring a thousand years of history through the lives and legacies of key figures. Boudicea, Alfred the Great, Offa, William the Conqueror and others.Wood charts the development of Anglo-Saxon England, from a series of fractitious, warring kingdoms on the boundaries of the civilised world, to the wealthiest kningdom in Europe, with the oldest monarchy.Throughout Micheal Wood bases his information on the latest archeological and historical evidence and analyses these to give a clear and accurate picture of events.I gave it four stars only because the book can be rather hard-going at times, and a little too technical, but the reader can get past that, to appreciate this fascinating book."
3,A fairly good kanji dictionary,"This dictionary is a good start for people learning Japanese that need to read actual written material. It contains about 2,900 characters and 12,000 compounds, and can be looked up by radical or reading. It also lists the compounds that include the current character at any position, not just the first one.The only problem in my opinion is that I use the wonderful Kodansha's Furigana Japanese-English and English-Japanese dictionaries, and this kanji dictionary uses romanization. Getting the readings for a character in romanized form is irritating at most, but looking up a reading in a romanized index when one is used to the kana a-i-u-e-o order is very annoying.This dictionary is very useful nontheless."
5,"Fabulous illustrations, fun story!",A great book that shows that it's okay to boisterous about the things you appreciate. Truly fabulous illustrations (very colorful!). Hold our daughters attention - which is a huge win for any book at the young age of 14 months!
2,lower quality,"I found these to be significantly rougher feeling than my other 300 tc sheets. When pulling the fitted sheet (not that hard)over the end of the bed, my thumb went through it (!). Gee. That's never happened before. Some early signs of pilling after one laundry. I wouldn't buy again. They look nice. They were only $18.99 (hence 2 stars)."
2,"Love the Sheets, but the wrong color","I got the sheets today and ordered Sand color, but I got Periwinkle instead. When I got home the sheets were already in the washer so I can no longer return them. This is the second time Amazon has screwed up and sent me the wrong color or item. Oh well I guess I will have to live with blue .."
1,Not what they appear to be,"Loved these sheets when the first hit the bed... but after the third washing, it started piling... Badly!Tiny, hard little bumps that are down right scratchy when you get into bed and I'm finding it annoying. These sheets won't make another 3 washings because, they will be headed for the trash!They started out really wonderful... soft and luxurious. I just don't know what could have happened...I do not recommend this brand."
4,nice light summer sheets,"Color and thread count confirmed to be as described and pictured on this website. I recommend these sheets for summer use as they are a bit lighter weight. Only problem -- likely because of the thread count -- is that they tend to wrinkle easily. Other than that, an excellent product for the price offered."
5,Great Sheets!,"Great sheets, wonderful color and are great to sleep on! Good deal and highly reccomended!"
2,Not What I Thought,The sheets felt & looked good until the first time I laundered them. From there I was disappointed. They totally lost their sateen feel & were rougher than my lower thread count sheets. They did not fit my bed as well as my other Queen sheets do. I bought two sets & no longer have either.
5,Great Buy,These sheets are a great buy for the money. I ordered the gold and the color is vibrant. They were very soft and have gotten softer with each washing. Have NOT seen any pilling either! I highly recommend these sheets.
3,Not without its problems,"Over the years, the Guinness Book of Records has evolved, and it hasn't always been good evolution. On the plus side, the fact that the book now contains many pictures (some quite grotesque) makes it more interesting than its early predecessors. That it now contains 30% drivel is not so positive. Commercialisation has done its worst to the Guinness Media since the loss of Ross McWherter. In my youth (a couple of years after Noah landed), the Guinness Book was a genuine work of reference that cataloged man's truimph over nature, himself and anything else that got in his way. Now, we seem to have categories for the most obscure, brainless schemes and, what's worse, those new uninteresting sections are included at the expense of the genuine achievements (or underachievements) of others.For style, the new Guinness Books are a great improvement. For content, I much preferred the originals"
2,Not for grown-ups,"As an adult reader returning to the series for the first time in many years, I found the maximum-volume graphic emphasis to be very off-putting. From the headache-inducing techno-art on the cover to the gruesome pictures of severe frostbite and Hiroshima victims inside, simply looking at the book was often an unpleasant experience. Enormous photographs of Anna Kournikova hiking up the panties up her tennis outfit and a Brazilian female beach volleyball player bent forward with her butt pointing at the camera contribute a different sense of unwholesomeness to the proceedings.I suppose younger readers would like all of the above; perhaps Guinness is aiming this book at them."
1,Small paper back book,"This is a small paper back book that is advertised as having ""incredible photographs."" There is nothing incredible about small, mostly black and white photos.I was disappointed with the quality of this book."
5,A flawless year 2000 book,"Some of the records reported in earlier editions aren't in this one. They are probably too easy to break.The cover of the book was a mirror. Most books around that Dewey Demical Classification number do the same thing for 2000 millennium editions.P.S. The photos of some female record-breakers---Shania Twain, Isabelle Adjani, and the woman dressed as Madonna---are alluring."
1,A sign of the times or an insult to the present,As many other's have stated there was a time when gueness world records book wasn't a giant hardcover book with tons of pictures when it actually was oozing with information. I don't know if this formatting of the book is reflective of modern american culture or a giant rip on it . If you are gonna have tennis players in the book might as well have a good one instead of sexpot anna kournikova .There are tons of many offbeat records not in here due to all the giant pictures for the preschool set. Sadly another wonderful institution has been lost to marketing towards the stereotypical younger set
4,The Best Guinness Yet,"This is the best Guinness yet - more photos, more information, broader range of topics. It's a book unique in the world, and fun for adults and kids alike. The trivia buff in your world would cherish it as a Christmas gift."
1,Buyer Beware,"There is nothing redeeming about this new version of Word. Ok, sure, they have a few nice changes here and there, but overall, this is nothing but a cheap update that is not-so-cheap on the checkbook. I don't know how Microsoft can get away with charging that much for basically doing nothing but ""patching"" a previous version.If you absolutely HAVE to have this product, I'd try to somehow obtain it through your employer's checkbook as a work-related write off. If you're unable to do that, just stick with Word 2000 or 1997. Most people don't notice the differences anyway, and most people just use it to write basic letters, memos, etc. If that's all you're doing, you don't need this. And unless you want to blow the price listed above, you don't need it either. You'll have much more fun and get much more satisfaction in taking those 3 Ben Franklin's and setting fire to them."
2,"No one needs Word anymore, with OpenOffice.org & StarOffice","Word is adequate, bloated, has a decent interface, and is ludicrously expensive. All in all, thumbs down. Word 2002 is just another edition of the same thing. I've used Word on and off since 1991, avoiding it whenever possible, and am so happy I don't have to use it anymore.Go to ... and download your office suite for free, or order StarOffice 6.0 here on Amazon. They both contain Writer, the Word equivalent that handles, and lets you create, Word files. (And programs that let you open and create Excel files and PowerPoint files.) Don't spend another penny on Word til you've tried OpenOffice.org or StarOffice."
2,Recant previous review for purchase from Cleerdeal.,"I am not repurchasing this product. I merely want to recant my previous review.. The product was not what I expected, - the product picture does not accurately reflect the actual product content. however The Company Cleerdeal - did everything they could do to rectify the situation and I am satisfied.Thank you."
1,what?!,Who in their right mind would pay this much for a simple word processing program? Certainly not I.
1,Poor,"i think this product was very poor, it is well over priced, and sould come as standad on new computers"
1,"Received ""For New PC only"" version",Having ordered MS Word 2002 I received MS Works Suite 2004 which includes MS Word but a version intended to be distributed with a new PC only and as such would not load on my old system. No refund available because I broke seal before finding out it was a for-new-system only package.
1,Just one more bug fix,Microsoft continues to issue pricey upgrades with minimal enhancements. Most folks want a reliable word processor that is easy intuitively easy to use - that's definitely not this product. Just try to set up different page numbers!
3,Professional Program with Unprofessional Animations,"Overall, MS Word is a very good tool. One extremely irritating addition to the latest version is ""Mr. Clippet"" or ""Clippy"", a cartoon animation that pops-up whenever the user needs to search the help index. If the user is consulting the help menu, he or she is probably already somewhat frustrated. The user doesn't need some dancing, dumb-ass cartoon as a distraction. Keep it professional! It also wouldn't hurt Microsoft's reputation if they were to make their program compatible with some of the other Word processing programs out there. For example, Star Office allows the import of MS Word documents, but Word doesn't allow the import of Star Office documents. Come on, Bill, play fair!"
1,Why Can't They Do As Well As WordPerfect???,"Every time MS comes out with a new version of Word I keep hoping they will completely revise the product and do better than WordPerfect. No such luck in the last 15 years, and not this time around. Sure glad my employer is the one paying for my copy. At home I'll stick with WordPerfect, which beats Word hands down. I mean it isn't even a contest. I'm sure MS can do better than this -- the question is: why don't they?"
1,bad purchase,This product would not work in my computer. I wasn't able to get a refund because I opened the product. How do you people expect anyone to see if it would work if you can't open it?
1,Scam,"This product is a rip off. I ordered this product and it arrived in a pretty timely fashion, however when I attempted to install the product, it did not work. The CD did not even pop up; it's as if I recieved a blank CD.The company says that it's something with my computer, but I have a Windows updated computer, that has recently has had microsoft on it before my computer crashed. I am now using this scam blank CD to burn music on it. Thanks a lot! :)"
3,Nice to have,I do very little with this but needed it because it did not come with my PC.I like how the spellchecker from Word crosses over to Outlook and does your e-mails. The last time I tried to load this I had problems like you always do with Microsoft.
3,"Good tunes, but.....","Look poeople, there is no need to own this cd set. My younger brother has it because he is not a committed fan. If you are a true fan of Black Sabbath, the band, you must own every album. You must have the Ozzy, the Dio, but also the lesser known gems. ""Born Again"" with Ian Gillan is a landmark in rock history, ""7th Star"" with Glenn Hughes is a masterpiece, and all the Tony Martin era tracks are must owns. By the cds, leave the compilations for lesser human beings."
2,If you're a.....,"If you're a 14-year-old dud who has heard a lot about this band but doesn't want to trace their history (or I should say the history of heavy metal), maybe this is a good place to start. But please don't tell anyone, except to another 14-year-old dud friend of yours, that you're a ""master"" of this band. Ever!"
2,"Sadly, it leaked","My seven year old son thought this fish tank was the coolest thing he had ever seen. And it really was, with the awesome coral formations and various undersea creatures, and of course the floating sharks. And it lights up, which makes it even cooler. BUT, when we put water in it, it leaked all over the counter. So, with heavy heart, I packed it up and sent it back. I didn't dare to order a replacement tank, thinking it might do the same thing. Instead, we went to the pet store, and spent many more dollars for a 10 gallon tank, light, filter, heater, coral reef decorations, SCUBA diver, plastic plants, gravel. . . . Oh, and of course, the fish, still a work in progress."
2,Cool idea but many difficulties!,"We purchased this for my son last Christmas to upgrade from his simple one gallon Beta tank which we had great success with. It's a cool idea, but we've been disappointed with it and will likely replace it before too long.The problems we've had:*Batteries are difficult to change and seem to run down quickly even though we try not to leave the lights on much.*Even with fresh batteries, the lights are not very bright.*The air bubblers have fouled over quickly*The sharks no longer float although they've been thoroughly scrubbed to make sure they have no growth on them.*And last but not least, we cannot keep fish alive. We have two large tanks in the house as well as two other beta tanks. We are familiar with fish. We've tried Bettas, molly's, and guppies."
4,The most detailed and rigorous derivations available,"For derivations of the cable equation and single-channel models, this book is unmatched. On the down-side, the coverage of related experimental neurobiology is quite dated."
4,Rescuing Dr Ryan by Caroline Anderson (Large Print Mills & Boon Medical Romance),"Description from the book back cover:The injured hero! He is supposed to be training Dr. Lucie Compton as a GP, yet here he is with two injured arms, relying on her for every undignified little thing. It's more than Will Ryan's pride can take. She disrupts his peace, his life, his dignity - and she's beautiful! She's kind, thoughtful ... and he's been dreaming about her! Not that he'd ever tell her. Lucie decides to save this grumpy but gorgeous soul from himself. In fact, she makes rescuing Dr. Ryan her very next challenge ..."
2,Not a good choice.,"Pros: Good for creating JPGs for sharing via email, Internet, or making a slide show.Cons: No optical zoom. When printing, pictures loose quality (not sure why). Video quality is very low. Poor battery life.The bottom line: this camera is your very basic digital toy. I bought it only because I was a novice at this and had no clue as to what quality digital camera suppose to contain."
3,Not what I was expecting.,"Having discovered RJD2 on Pandora and liked the few songs I've heard, I decided to purchase this CD. RJD2 produces music that I find myself liking, but, in some cases, not caring for the arrangement. Magnificent City Instrumentals, as a whole is good, but, not great. There are a couple great tracks, but, some of the tracks that could be great just get too repetitive for my taste. However, as is typical with all RJD2's tracks, the creativity in using samples and his blending of what most would consider non-musical elements into a cohesive work is what keeps drawing me back to his work. If you like RJD2, buy this album. If you are introducing yourself to RJD2, find something else by which to first immerse yourself in his world."
1,Charles Dickens Audio CD Review,"This CD was terrible. I thought I was ordering a CD of all of Charles Dickens Books on Audio, but what I got was a recording of some Old Radio Shows off of an old LP. After getting this CD, and listening to it for the first time, I went back to the ad to see if it stated anywhere that it was a recording of old Radio Shows, I didn't see that and would not have ordered it if it did. On a scale of 1 to 5 I give it a 1/2"
2,"LESS THAN ""SUPER-DUPER""","Perhaps we should just be grateful that these nine rare titles are available. Then again, ""minimally happy"" seems more apropriate. Sound quality is O.K. on all titles, however picture quality leaves much to be desired. It appears as though the source material came from one of the old time 16 MM ""basement dupers"". Fuzzy picture, washed out faces, poor contrast, etc. Had I been aware of the very poor picture quality, I probably would have passed. But, coming from Alpha Video, I should have been forewarned. They are just like a box of chocolates (you never know what you'll get). So, I remain ""minimally happy"" yours; Don Kruse, Memphis."
3,John Howard just does not make a good Bulldog,"It looks like Capt. Hugh Chesterton 'Bulldog' Drummond (John Howard) is getting married to Phyllis (Louise Campbell) and giving up the detecting racket. He almost loses the wedding rings, but with a little ingenuity and a stick of American gum, they are retrieved. A lot of good that does him as it turns out a scientist is missing along with an extraordinary explosive formula. Only Bulldog finds out the hard way with a severed arm containing a familiar ring. Col. J.A. Nielson (John Barrymore) of Scotland Yard wants to know how Bulldog fits in the situation.Yes, this is a formula spy story with a Bulldog Drummond overlay. Based on the novel ""The Return of Bulldog Drummond."""
2,"Nice, but worth the money? Get OpenOffice.org for free","It's a lovely product; aside from a little too much automatic formatting, it does what I want it to. However, A) my employer bought it for me and B) I don't do much with it. And everything want to do with it, OpenOffice (www.openoffice.org) does for me. So I don't see the point. Openoffice opens PowerPoint files, does lots of slide type features, and unless you need to do really spectacular effects, you should be fine with the FREE OpenOffice suite.You can try StarOffice too; it costs a little more than free but way less than PowerPoint.OpenOffice has some pretty cool three D drawing effects included, plus all the standard slide effects and object effects for sucking in bullet points from the side, etc. You can print handouts, notes, all that stuff.Try OpenOffice.org before you spend your car payment on PowerPoint!"
2,"Good, but StarOffice Impress is as good or better","I've been using Ppt for a while but not anymore. Before I upgraded, that is when I was considering upgrading, I downloaded OpenOffice.org, the free version of StarOffice, and I was blown away. It opened all my PowerPoint files, and it has most of the same features. I use Impress all the time now, whether my clients need Impress or PowerPoint file formats. Does'em both.Try Impress first, from the OpenOffice.org or StarOffice office suite."
2,Not worth the money,"While I've found this product to be quite useful, it is unnecessarily expensive. I used to only use the powerpoint program on the school computers, but I found an alternative. OpenOffice.org has an entirely free version of office. Impress is the name of the equivalent program to powerpoint, and it works for everything I have needed to do with it. Don't pay the monopoly for powerpoint, it's not worth that much money."
3,Good Introduction,"Our son is 6 and he LOVES this program. It is an inexpensive way to get your child to learn some basic Spanish. There is no English translation, however, so it helps if you know a little Spanish."
3,KidSpeak Spanish,"While the games on this software are fun for small children, the Spanish spoken in the games is not the standard Mexican Spanish that is usually taught in American schools. This is difficult to deal with when using this as a teaching aid."
3,Good but not great!,"I looked around for this title for a while, then one day it hit me, LOOK ONLINE. What do you know, Amazon.com had it! Great! Now I could listen to the wisdom that would spout out of the Belz's mouth when ever I wanted to.One problem, the audio quality left much to be desired. The Belz's audio would fluctuate. Sometimes he was loud and other times he was soft. I mean you could still hear everything, but it was not the high quality one hopes for.The humor itself was top notch. I swear that he does the best impression of Bob Dylan that I have ever heard.If you have read his book on conspiracies and then listen to this album you would find where he got a lot of his material for the book.The Belz rules! I am not here to dispute that, but this CD is not the best way to represent the Belz!"
3,"Very funny, but plagued by audio problems","This is a weird album. I consider the mix of reality audio clips with comedy one of the album's experimental high points. Other high points include Belzer's excellent impersonations and musical talents. Paul Shaffer was an unwelcome guest for me. I find his vaudeville caricatures irritating. The greatest distraction, however, is the poor audio quality. I imagine the routine(s) would have been funnier with better editing and a re-mastering of the material. I feel bad giving Belzer a mediocre score, but sound quality matters for all audio media. Listen close, and this is funnier than most comics performing today."
1,Order not received,What happened to my order? I am not a happy customer. I still have not received my order. Where is It?
4,doesn't get any poppier or metro than this,"One minute into this engaging ditty and you'll be checking your calendar to remember what year it is. Phil Spector-esque wall-of-sound production style of Adam Schlesinger make for an amusing journey back in time -- though there are wisely enough grungy guitar curves and ironic lyrical passages thrown in to make the grade. Billboard's October 12, 1996 review advised Top 40 programmers to have a close listen to this."
3,"Not Queens, maybe Princesses","The Queens of Comedy would have been a whole lot better if they had another subject to talk about other than Sex. I know that sex and comedy goes hand in hand, but the ability to tell a story about anything is what makes great comedians really stand out from just ordinary. Adele Givens was by far the funniest of the ladies, she has actually toned down her cursing if you can believe that. Sommore was the next funniest because she at least talked about her stint in jail. Mo'nique is just loud. I kept thinking you have a microphone, why you have to be so loud. During the little shorts that they showed between the stage performances she tried to over talk everyone around her,hmmmm maybe she was deprived of attention as a child. Laura Hayes was the MC and she is just not funny. It is much better to watch if you have a group of friends over and you have been drinking."
3,ok but not great,"with all the talented women in this video i thought for sure that this would have been an outstanding video...not. it was ok but not great. The routines were extremely vulgar. I am not a prude by any means, but the vulgarity overshadowed the jokes and left this viewer to wonder what were they thinking? All in all this isn't bad if you are renting it, but it isn't good enough to purchase. If you MUST purchase a video the kings of comedy is better by far"
5,Country Humor That's Deliciously Entertaining!,"What can one say? This entire show is sinfully funny! This is down home, working folk, non-politically correct humor at its best. Colorful language so it isn't for young audiences..."
3,"pretty funny ladies, but too much bad language","The queens of comedy consists of four comedian women telling some of the most funniest dirtiest jokes ever with plenty of foul language. If you don't like hearing alot of vulgar language or profanity, then this is not for you. but if you do, then go ahead and buy it! The funniest lady was Monique and the she was the most profane out of them all. They all tell jokes about sex, about white pple, black pple, skinny women and fat women, etc. Monique tells the jokes about how she cannot stand skinny b*tches and how they ought to eat more and that if she ever sees one she's gonna bust the skinny b*tch over the head. That part was pretty funny. The audience was surely dying with laughter. Though if you find these kind of jokes offensive, then don't get this dvd.Monique's the funniest, nastiest and strongest comedian out of the four ladies. I thought there was a bit too much bad language though nevertheless, I was laughing pretty hard that I had tears!"
1,Ummmm.....I'm Still Waiting To Laugh.,"There are truly no words to describe the abject failure of this entire project. Even if ""The Kings...."" hadn't been stellar (which it is) this still would not register or merit even half a star. Am I the only person who was uncomfortable hearing Adele Givens attack the late Lisa 'Left Eye'Lopes? Could Laura (stop saying ""Memphis!"") Hayes have been anymore ethnic and unfunny? (and please stop taking your wig off looking angry, it wasn't funny 10 years ago and it's downright pathetic today.) Sommore and Monique were just plain embarrassing; ladies take note, loud and vulgar doesn't equal funny. This is almost too painful to watch, it isn't comedy it's a 21st century minstrel show. Avoid this at all costs."
1,Ugh!,I hated this movie. I'm not prudish at all but I thought the Queens of Comedy was more vulgar than funny. I was inspired to watch this movie because I enjoyed the Kings of Comedy tremendously. I was deeply disappointed.
5,HAHAAHAHAHAA,These Broads are F U N N Y!! I had know idea that woman from the Parker's could get her joke on!! I saw this Live and the Women Out did the Men!! Queens of Comedy They ARE!
3,Past reviewers have made continuous comparisons STOP IT!!!,"After watching the Queens I asked those with me what was funnier ....The Kings or the Queens ....the response......They are both good but in different ways, the content, ambience, the audience present - VERY DIFFERENT. I thought it was very funny Adele was the funniest, the host was mediocre and Sommore and Monique were very entertaining...Yes the sexual content was a dominant feature but it was not crude and distasteful (well maybe once) but it was the audience that made the at home viewer doubt the quality of the comedy (as we South Londoners say "" They were so DRY!!!!!!) I don't know if they came straight from church but it seemed they all felt guilty for laughing. And they were old ... and everyone knows you shouldn't cuss in fornt of grown folk so that kinda kills the vibe. As a 22 year old I thought it was funny ..., don't expect a great Bernie Mac performance but do expect a good time!! Go on you can trust me"
2,More smutty than funny,"I didn't like this as well as ""Kings of Comedy"" for one main reason: most of the comedians here are more smutty than funny. In fact, they seem to think that merely referring to a ""...."" is simply hysterical and a sure laff-getter. There are a few good jokes in the film, but it's not worth the money."
3,Plodding,"Not that they aren't funny, they just pale in comparision to the Kings. The humor in this is harsher than the men, and that is most likely the biggest failing. The men work on you with humor, the women work to shock you. They fail most of the time. You will laugh, but it is not the same as the Kings."
1,What a load of rubbish,"This movie just clarifies what I've always said, ""female comedians for the most part are rubbish"". There are some good female comedians out there, but these four ladies are not in that select few. Just weak jokes about nothing I haven't heard before. Good luck to them though. Make that paper!"
1,"The F bomb used too much, FAILURE","seriously. I didn't understand this. This show sucked. It really, really sucked. Every other word was an F bomb and the fat one kept talking about sex and going into detail and it made me shudder. I'd rather staple gun myself in the forehead then see this piece of crap again. I'd give it 0 stars if I could."
1,How to outcurse a Man in 60 long minutes or more,"The jokes were not funny. They felt they had to out cuss each other to make a punchline. In the Kings of Comedy, at least we had a wide spectrum of humor, with ""a little cursing...to a lot of cursing"".. This was not the case on this waste of money. The Queens of Comedy, I think not. I'm not sure what Land these Queens are reigning from, but I suggest you leave your passport at the border."
3,Pretty Good,"When I first watched this movie I was expecting to see a show much like ""The Original Kings Of Comedy."" In many ways it was the same, but I don't think it was quite as funny. Don't get me wrong, these ladies really did a good job, but it just wasn't quite the same. I think my favorite performer in this film was S'more. She was hilarious!All in all, this wasn't a terrible comedy film, but it was missing the spark that the ""Kings"" had."
2,Ha..........,"This video wasn't as funny as I thought. A lot of swearing and loud talking about nothing from Mo'nique. Her stand up on BET's comic view was better than this. Adele Givens was the funniest of them all. Miss Laura wasn't very good either. Sommore, needed some more funny lines. She was better and funnier on BET's comic view also. Four women on the road, talking about silly stuff wasn't my idea of comedy. Two stars in zee formation."
4,fun and nasty,great stand up comediene movie about 4 very popular ladies in comedy. everybody works hard in pleasing the audience. monique is the main attraction. be warned. monique is in your face and nasty. all sailer language is used and some extra. i enjoyed the show.
1,Comedy?,"I didn't laugh once. Sometimes I didn't even understand how these people became the queens of comedy. Rent the blue collar comedy tour if you want funny. This film starts dry and ends the same way, not funny.Now, I could assemble 4 people and call them the queens of comedy. Anyone can. These 4 ladies didn't give me one grin. I am not kidding."
1,These women are NOT queens!,"I decided to see this because I saw the Kings Of Comedy and liked it a lot,so I decided to watch this.It was one of the worst hours I spent of my life.It is just four black women who rely on cussing and sex jokes to get laughs.I don't mind cussing,but using it to get laughs is pointless.I bet that ""Left Eye"" is rolling over in her grave because of these jokes.They are just plain degrading.Miss Laura really needs to stop taking off her wig all the time,Adele needs to learn some new phrases other than ""I'm such a f***ing lady"".Monique also needs to learn some new jokes that aren't about sex.Once they follow my advice,I wouldn't mind seeing a Queens of Comedy 2.In the meantime,stick with the Kings.They are much better."
5,"Totally Rad, Dude!","This game rules. It's just like real football!It has eight real NFL stars and thirty other kooky people that can make up your seven-man team. The game play is cool also. You can create your own plays, make a great play to get a special play, and then watch your characters do touchdown dances. Buy it!"
5,A Quality Game,"My kids love this game. It is easy for them to use. Both my 5 yr old and 8 yr old play without any problem. The game is squeaky clean so there is no problem with questionable language, innuendo etc. like some other games. This game is absolutely worth the money! Buy it."
4,Great read,This book was very insightful. Lots of useful basketball Information. One negative mentionedby several people was the fact that the diagrams were not better organized. The text would referto a diagram located two pages ahead. Confusing at times.
5,Great book for higher level coaches,I love this book and have bought it for several of my coaching friends. Full of great info from one of the best. Good diagrams and great instruction on how to implement multiple offenses and defenses. One of my favorite coaching books (and I have a ton). A great higher-level resource.
5,Very good,"I really loved this book. When I bought it, I wasn't sure that I did a good choise. After I read it, I understood that, it was the bast choice, I could do. This book showed me and learnt me the secret, which I couldn't see by watching basketball games on TV."
3,"OK, but not his best","Lou Rawls had an incredibly smooth, expressive voice, but I was disappointed in this album even though it has a stellar cast of guest artists including Joe Williams, Phebe Snow, Junior Wells, Joe Lovano, and Buddy Guy to name a few. I think the two best cuts are ""Save Your Love for Me"" and ""Saturday Night Fish Fry."" To me, the rest of the songs seem to lack the spontaneity of his best work. I doubt that I'll listen to this cd much now that I've heard it a couple of times. A better choice, in my opinion, is ""The Legendary Lou Rawls,"" a five star album that I don't get tired of hearing."
2,"Good idea, but hardly usable","The clip does not open enough to attach the mirror to the stroller's frame, so you have to fit it on the sunshade or other less sturdy parts. Does not work for me."
4,Stephen King in the raw,"This collection of stories was published when King was still early in his career. Most of them are very frightening. ""The Bogeyman"", which I first read when I was 12 will make you think twice about leaving the closet door open at night was especially good. ""Strawbery Spring"" has a horrifying twist ending and ""I am the Doorway"" has an echo 20 years later in King's book Dreamcatcher. Read the introduction by John MacDonald and the foreward by King himself. In light of what life was to throw at King in later years both are fascinating."
5,Horror Writting at its best.,"I started reading Stephen King's books at 11, and I remember I was both delighted and terrified by novels such as Pet Sematary. I'm 24, and his writing still produces that in me. Classics such as Children of the Corn, Jerusalem's lot,and The Boogeyman-man, I almost couldn't sleep after that one-make this book a winner-even if it's old! This collection of short stories are beautifully written, with a maestry hard to find in new authors. There's a reason Stephen King is the Master of Horror writting in modern times, and you can find it in this book."
3,Mediocre,"I dont understand what everyone is talking about. These stories are not that good. Half of them are so average that I forget that they are written by the supposedly horror master Stephen King. Half of the stories are average, and the rest are down right bad. I only enjoyed about 5 of the 20+ stories. I was truly disappointed. A few of the stories were so bad that I find myself asshamed to having read them. However, I will give credit where credit is due. The story about the army men was a very good read. It was very exciting and interesting. The story about the trucks was readible; and all of the stories which spawned movies except the lawnmower man were all Ok.In particular I found that Children of the Corn was a great short story. I was very surprised."
4,Sick Puppy,"I said this about Edgar Allen Poe when I read his writings. King's short stories are good and scary, but are kind of sick too. Rats, machines, and voodoo, are among the subjects Mr. King explores. He writes one story that has a humorous overtone to it, one that is about toy army men and their various weapons. Good stuff though, if your into sci-fi thrillers."
3,Quite boring,I have just finished reading the book and found it quite boring. Only a few stories interest me. I am quite disappointed. Maybe I had expected too high from the book when I read the reviews of other readers. the ratings are a bit misleading. I think it deserves 3 stars.
4,Some stories to remember,"Though not as good as some of his novels, the short stories in Night Shift are fairly good. Some of the best are ""Sometimes they Come Back"", ""The Mangler"", and ""Quitters, Inc."" Also two stories dealing with Salem's Lot, one like a sequal the other a totally new aproach."
1,This is the One!!,"This is it. This is the book that made me give up Stephen King once and for all. This creepy, disgusting collection was just the last straw for me. Oh yes, he's good, but in the wrong way. His books give me nightmares for YEARS, not just days. They color the way I look at the world. This world is horrifying enough. Bye, Stevie."
1,One of the most horrible books I ever had the displeasure of reading.,"I am a Stephen King fan. In fact, my most favorite book to date is his masterpiece, The Stand.But the stories in this book are just pointless, uninteresting, uninspiring and downright awful.I am simply dumbfounded at how this became a #1 best seller, or why it has such great reviews on this website. Rarely have been so utterly disappointed in a book."
5,And he does short stories too!,"Ya know, I have thought of Stephen King (my favorite author) as being a Novel kinda guy, but until I got this book. Now I consider him one of the best horror writers ever. He can pack so much into just these short stories, it's amazing."
4,Good,"I liked this book, mainly because I like short stories. The two or three stories near the end made the book ""die"" though. They weren't as gripping as the other stories in the book."
4,Short Tales from a Young SK,"Not that SK cares about my review, he's writing abilities are supernatural. But personally I find his older short stories to be his best. TRUCKS the short tale included in this collection is both SciFi and Horror in the most perfect setting."
4,"Yes, this is King's best book.","I've tried reading many of King's books and I have to admit I'm not a fan. His method is tiring for me and I usually lose interest b/c they drag on for so long. I decided to give ""Night Shift"" a chance since it is a collection of stories and thus would not allow him to drag on. I was pleasantly surprised and did enjoy the collection.I have to say that the most terrifying of the stories was indeed ""Children of the Corn."" I have seen the movie and while it's not the best in horror, it was certainly chilling. The story is even more horrifying, if you will. It certainly does not disappoint. ""Boogeyman"" is also included in this anthology and it most certainly is scary! I also enjoyed ""Lawnmower Man"" (nothing like the 90s movie). If you want to get your feet wet w/ King's writing this is where to start. You will not be disappointed."
5,WOW!! Stephen King is the master of horror!!!,"I just got ""Night Shift"", and it is truly one of the best collections of short stories I have ever read. All of these are classic stories, absolutely bone-chilling. I read ""The Boogieman"" last night before going to bed, and I was scared to turn out the light. I kept looking towards the closet, expecting the Boogieman to pop out of it and eat me at any moment. ""Graveyard Shift"" is also one of my favorites, as are the two gems titled ""Jerusalem's Lot"" and ""Gray Matter."" I don't care how old you are or what type of books you prefer reading; this book will have you rivited by the first paragraph. Kings writing is superb. Go to the nearest bookstore and buy this collection of short stories by the Master of Horror. I can garuantee you it is worth it!!"
3,Solid collection of short fiction,"I enjoyed this collection of short stories, Stephen King's first. The better stories in the batch were, ""Jerusalem's Lot"", ""The Boogeyman"", ""Strawberry Spring"", and ""Children of the Corn"". It is clear from the stories that King is a natural writer of short fiction, which makes his transition to novels all the more impressive. I'm looking forward to reading his other short fiction collections."
3,King collects good and bad!,"Its hard to review a collection of short stories because its hard to lump the good with the bad. Some were really good, such as Children Of The Corn, Sometimes They Come Back, Strawberry Spring, and One For The Road. Sadly, there are a couple clunkers in the mix like: Lawnmower Man, Trucks, and I Am The Doorway. What this book does show however is the extremely wide array of stories floating around in King's head. Pretty amazing when you think about the diversity. A pretty good book to flip through but far from great."
3,Pretty Good,"This wasn't one of King's best. Some of the short stories are very chilling and dicriptive, but i felt some were rushed. it seemed as if a few of the endings of the short stories were rapped up too quickly and ended up sounding corny. Other than this, it is a very well written cllection of scary short stories."
4,Excellent.,"For the sake of continuity I'm putting something like this at the beginning of all these reviews. I've taken it upon myself to read the entire King library in chronological order.This collection was fantastic. I can honestly see why a lot of people long for King's 'classic style'. Personally, I'm a huge fan of monsters. Specifically, non-cliched monsters, or cliched monsters that are being examined in a new life. This book was filled with monsters of all kinds and was extremely satisfying.The stories ranged from absurd to awesome to frightening to downright grim. The grim ones weren't horror of fantastic sort but more of a real-life sort, almost serving as a prelude to what would eventually come along in Full Dark, No Stars.A definite read for anyone considering King for the first time."
4,A world of horror brought to you by the master Stephen King,"I loved this book. It is very entertaining. The best stories were Jerusalem's Lot, Children Of the Corn, and The Ledge. The worst were Gray Matter, The Boogieman and The Mangler"
3,Three stars!,"I enjoyed most of the stories. However, not all of them were really ""scary"" or macabre. All in all, it was a pretty good book!"
3,"Not bad, have read better","Although this is his first collection of short stories, I have to say that it's not the best. Some of the stories just didn't keep my attention.The top five best are ""Battleground"", ""Quitters, Inc."", ""The Ledge"", ""I am the Doorway"", and ""Graveyard Shift."""
3,awesome book with editing issues,"I've been reading it out of order, so it came to my attention that some of the stories seem to suffer from poor editing issues. The woman in the room, for instance, which closes the book, has several lines missing in a few paragraphs, which make understanding harder.The stories themselves? Top notch King stuff. 5 stars from me, aside from the editing issues which really do ruin the show for the few stories where it shows up."
4,Short stories fit for a King.,"It's almost 3 a.m., and I just finished reading Night Shift...on the night shift. When I got this book I didn't even realize it was a collection of short stories, but I'm so glad it was. I really enjoyed diving into a story and reading the entire thing in only 20-30 minutes. Of course some are better than others for each reader, but all were worth it. My faves were ""Quitters"", ""The Ledge"", ""Trucks"", and ""One For The Road"". A few of these became movies you'll come to find if you don't know already. What I learned most from Night Shift is that Stephen King isn't just a good horror writer, he's a good writer."
4,An excellent collection of short stories,"To start things off, I was really pleased with this particular book. I don't usually like to read a book of short stories, probably because there isn't nearly enough detail. As a matter of fact, one of the only reasons I actually picked it up is because of the stories that were listed...Children of the Corn, Graveyard Shift, and Sometimes They Come Back might sound a bit familiar (i.e.-movies that have been made). Nevetheless, I wholly approved of The Night Shift, and I recommend it to anyone that likes to read King's works. :)"
4,"Many great stories, but also some boring ones.","I really like this book, don't get me wrong, but I was upset because some of the stories were just too boring or hard to understand. I skipped over Jerusalem's Lot because I could not stand the layout, and I was disapointed by stories such as Gray Matter, Night Surf and I Am the Doorway. Gray Matter was just odd, and I Am the Doorway was not developed enough. Night Surf, however,was just downright stupid. There was no action or excitment, just conversation. But there were also many great stories in this book such as The Boogeyman, Quitters Inc., The Ledge, I Know What You Need, and my personal fav, Strawberry Spring. Quitters, Inc. was a great twist as was Strawberry Spring. The Boogeyman left me with many sleepless nights and believe me, it will leave you with some, too. This is a great book to reread and is full of chills and thrills. If the story doesn't suit you, just skip it and read on. Hope you enjoy it!"
5,Another Thriller by the Master of Horror!,"This book was so interesting, I couldn't put it down! I read every book by Stephen King, even though I had to borrow one from the librery of Congress. In fact, I'm watching IT even while I am writing this! My favorite story was CHILDREN OF THE CORN! I watch the movie every week, no kidding! So if you want to read a really good book, pick it up today!"
5,EveryBody Needs Midnight Louie!,"Spectacular! Midnight Louie is the best and the brightess of all mystery felines. When characters such as those created by Ms. Douglas are able to reach out and grab you and make you truly believe they are as real as you and I...well this is book writing at its finest! We all know one of those feisty,aloof,smarter than humans cat. The one cat that swaggers instead of walks, well this is Mr. Midnight Louie and his associates. You will not be disappointed in this wonderful book or any other Carole Nelson Douglas and Midnight Louie adventures. I am a fussy reader of mysteries and I can not put down these books once I begin reading. Midnight Louie and company really speak to you and what a wonderful gift it is for a writer to create characters that communicate with the reader. Carole Nelson Douglas has a rare and beautiful gift. Please support Midnight Louie you will Love him as much as I do!Alison B. CuffMidnight Acres in Middleboro, MA"
2,Bogged Down,"I couldn't get into the story as most of the sentences were gussied up with fancy prepositions and the gratuitous use of ""Jimmy Choos."" With 380 pages to go, I wrote my $$$ as a loss."
5,So damn funny it's unbelievable,"Margaret Cho is the foulest, most irreverent, and funniest female comic around. Pretty much everything on this album is a riot, but it's worth the price just to hear Margaret's mother accuse her of being a lesbian. Hysterical."
5,MARGARET CHO IS BY FAR THE BEST!!,"This is simply the best cd that you can ever buy! Margaret Cho has been my favorite comedian of all time and I was surprised to know that she had a cd out. You can never get tired of her. I wish she'd put out another cd with all her new skits like ""MULAN!!""."
2,Peek-a-boo,"First of all, this is not the suppliers fault. It was my mistake. For Moms that are trying to order these practice pants, your son will probably not wear them. You would have to wear white compression shorts underneath. If they don't, their boxers will be a peek-a-boo moment. I was unaware you can see through these pants. I will try ordering the heavyweight ones. Thank you though, for offering the variety you do."
1,Not Funny!,"I'm so dissapointed at the BSK Joke book. I shared them to my cousins, relatives and classmates but thy were not funny. So i just sold it for $3.99 to get my money back."
2,Dry Martini book,"Exactly the first half of the book is information about martinis before getting to the recipes which are the basic common martinis found in any martini guide or book or even online. If you want the history of the martini in detail, then this book is for you. If you want recipes, then I recommend The Bartender's Black Book (9th edition) that contains over 2800 total recipes with a lot of useful information for mixing drinks."
5,A Very Special Reason,"My son and his wife sing in a choir in Victoria, B.C., and during the time when his older sister was dying from cancer in Toronto, the choir sang for her at every choir practice the first verse of Be Thou A Smooth Way. An artist friend designed a memorial card for my daughter and it contained this verse, then my friend remembered she had a copy of The Celtic Vision, in which the complete prayer is printed. We both were touched by what we learned about the spirituality of the ancient Celts and loved some of the prayers. I purchased my own copy, which I use frequently and treasure, and then bought six other copies as gifts for family and friends."
4,celtic vision,"this is an excellent overall book of prayers, songs and blessings from the gaelic traditions and i am enjoying it very much. it is definately the type of book i will be going back to time and again--looking for a prayer or blessing that is particularly appropriate to a situation in my life or in the life of my family in general"
1,Small Book,"I was more than a little disappointed to see I had paid $3.49 for a book that is about the size of a 4x6 photograph! Especially when the price on the back cover says $1.50!! I've seen nicer books for about $1.50 at Target that also can fit in your purse for when you are on the go. Beware of the tiny size of these ""Dover Little Activity Books""!! You get what you pay for."
3,"Nice little compact book, but stiff, small letters.","The book is compact, which makes it great for kids who like ""small"" or older children who are better able to hold open a small, stiff bound book and manuever a pencil with good fine motor control. This isn't as great for a younger child who is learning letters though because the letters are small, and they are unlikely to find it easy to complete. Better for a child with good motor control who wants extra practice with letters, or just likes dot-to-dots."
5,Have you ever been mellow? Have you ever tried?,"This CD is a great collection of Olivia's greatest hits. Although it is far from complete, and doesn't include some of her live favorites (such as ""Don't Cry for Me, Argentina""), it still encapsules some of her finest moments, from the early country/pop to the later straight-forward rock/pop that made her a star."
3,"Back to Basic: The Essential Collection ""71-""92","This is a great collection of Olivia's work. She is so talented. She has proven to be truly an asset to the music world. However, I strongly believe she has been very overlooked by an American audience. I wish we could hear her more on the radio and see more of her on the big screen or TV. I am glad we are now able to get imports of her music. Her songs really move the listener, set the mood, and take us back with this CD collection. A must for all of her fans!"
5,kicking music!,"Five Fingers is one of the last true hip hop bands, and suprisingly they go almost unrecognized, you cant find their stuff in stores and thats part of why it is so cool."
5,I want I want I want,I want this cd. One of my friends has it and I bought the other one but now I can't get this one and I want it. These guys are the best ever.
4,Not One of My Dogs Favorites ... And he's not fussy about toys.,"Didn't care for this toy so much ... That is my dog didn't care much, which surprised me since he loves all toys."
1,Completely brain dead.,"A friend of mine let me borrow a couple of his Pilger books, I wish had spent my time cleaning the toilet or something instead.This guy must have an IQ of about 65-70. Some of the arguments in this book are beyond stupid."
5,great value and quality,"I'm 130 lbs; 12 oz is too light for sparring and 16 are slightly bulky+heavy for me to work on the bag with, so I got the 14 oz ones. Great blue color, looks better than the black ones, and a great construction.Not that much of a smell to them as some people say, just a slight smell of the fabric. I'm sensitive to smells and have seasonal allergies and had no problem working with them.My hands aren't that big, and these gloves are the perfect fit. Haven't tried, but I think it'll be tight to wear handwraps inside them. Maybe they'll stretch with use.."
2,Worst lining!,"These gloves have the worst synthetic lining I have ever seen, it already tore in the wrist (leaving the padding loose) and fingers area."
3,"Good, but have a weird smell.","These seem to be working out fine. I've only worn them once (for kickboxing) but my Trainer thinks they will be great for my purposes, and they seemed to fit okay. (I got the 12oz and I am 5'7"" 125lbs.) The most notable thing is, THEY ARE SMELLY. Like, some crazy weird synthetic smell, from the moment I took them out of the package. I actually had to leave them out of my gym bag for awhile to air out. When my husband came in later, he was like ""Whoa! There is some WEIRD SMELL in the office!!!"" And I was like ""It's my new boxing gloves."" It took days for them to be tolerable, and even now I can't leave them in an enclosed space for long. I've only had them for about a month though, so hopefully it will go away in time. The shared boxing gloves at the gym REALLY stink (like old sweat) so I guess I'd rather have ""new boxing glove smell"" instead!"
4,Kick Box Gloves,"Love the color, the velcro stickies take a little getting use too! other than that, so far, so good!received fast (within a week)"
3,Used to be better,"I bought a pair of the 14 oz a couple years ago and they lasted for like two and a half years. Then the lining started ripping and they were hopelessly stinky so I bought a new pair last week. The new pair stank like chemicals *way* worse than the other pair, the wrist is much floppier and offers no support, and the velcro is harder to fasten."
5,Boy approved.,I bought these for my son for his birthday. He was very happy.Thank you. Now if I can just get him to hand them over when I want to sock something responsibly :)
4,Good gloves for the price,"Great for hitting a bag. Solidly made. Padding is spread out a bit so you can really feel the punches, I'd probably look for something a bit more padded for sparring though."
2,"bought this, then went to the store to try out protex gels","the product is ok for beginners or someone messing around. as fair as its breathable mesh, not really.. it wasn't long before my hands started sweating. i wouldn't want to spar with these, because there isn't enough cushion and the straps could cut someone. shipped on time (2 days for prime). all in all, if you have money, the protex gel is the way to go. go out to the local sports store and try them on. you will see the difference. big time. so much more comfortable."
4,Great Item but 16oz is big,Great product for bag classed but no one said that the 16oz would be larger in size the the other boxing gloves. I think someone supposed to mention that it would be bigger than the other gloves in size and shape...
2,Not good if you hit heavy bags,"These may be decent gloves for beginners but if you are a decent amateur fighter, train semi seriously, or throw heavy punches on the bag, pick another glove. I used these gloves for about 3 weeks and the middle knuckle on my left hand is starting to hurt from throwing a lot of jabs. I think I'm just going to have to bite the bullet and buy a more expensive more serious hook and loop glove as these just dont do the job."
5,Everlast Boxing Gloves,These are great gloves. There tight fitting and very comformtable. Great for hitting my bag.
1,Too small. Nasty smell,"I bought these to use with my heavy bag. I have average sized hands and these fit almost perfect, maybe slightly loose, without wraps on. But you need to wear wraps, and these would not fit with wraps on.Also, the chemical smell on this is pretty strong and it makes me feel nauseated.I'm not sure what to do, because I don't want to spend a lot of money for gloves. But these are useless."
4,Everlast 16 oz. training gloves,I bought my 14 year old son 16 oz. and trains with a 70 lbs training bagGREAT QUALITY GLOVES.
2,a bit week in the seems,"though the price was certainly right for these gloves, they promptly split at the seems during the 2nd or 3rd training session. A little duck tape allowed me to continue using them, but from now on I will spend a little more money and get a better glove. My trainer told me to get genuine leather and I am wishing that I would have taken his advice."
1,Garbage quality and Horrible chemical smell,"DO not buy these gloves. They aren't worth the little money you spend on them. They are extremely cheap and flimsy and give off a STRONG chemical smell. Do not underestimate how strong these gloves smell. Its nauseating and it doesnt go away. Regret every penny spent on this trash. If your serious about training, and want a quality product, invest in some reyes gloves. They are $100+ but real leather and they last you. I dont even want to give these gloves away they are so bad. The garbage seems like the final destination for this crap. Waste of money."
4,Nice for light sparring but dont hit the bag or your opponent too hard with any gloves like these,"We do a lot of sparring at the gym. Everlast is ususally a good bet. I have only heard of everlast boxing gloves falling apart too early maybe twice over the last 14 years. These are good gloves for sparing, etc. I still keep a pair in my bag but I made the switch to a higher priced glove a while back and haven't pulled these out of the bag since. I've gone through a few pairs of these gloves over the years and they are well worth the money. Once you go to a higher quality brand you probably won't go back to these, but they get the job done for a good price. I wouldn't recommend them for just hitting the bag because they're a bit hard and you risk damaging your wrist."
3,14 oz Everlast Training Gloves,This is a basic boxing gloves for heavy bag punching and low intensity sparring. I use these gloves twice a week and it is holding up fine so far. How long the gloves will remain usable is something to be seen.
3,fine for training,"These are cheap, which is a big plus, and are fine for training, but feel a bit sloppy. Pretty much what I expected -- I just wanted a back up pair of gloves to keep at the office for when I head to the gym from there instead of from home."
4,Good Blag Gloves for the Money...,"I've gone through a few pairs of these gloves over the years and they are well worth the money. Once you go to a higher quality brand you probably won't go back to these, but they get the job done for a good price. I wouldn't recommend them for sparring because they're a bit hard and your sparring partner might not be happy. These are good gloves for bagwork, boxing cardio classes, etc. I still keep a pair in my bag but I made the switch to a higher priced glove a while back and haven't pulled these out of the bag since.I just reread my review and while I said these gloves are good but also said that I don't use them anymore, I guess my final point is that if you are a beginner to the sport, or are looking for good bag gloves, these will do you just fine."
5,Cousin love his Christmas gift.,My cousin loves his Christmas gift he's been using the gloves in his everyday workouts. The gloves are made with good quality material.
3,Price can't be beat,"The item arrived very fast. I liked the item better than the displayed image. Good quality, but not for the serious."
1,These do not work,"I used these for a kickboxing class, it was my first time taking it and only once a week. After only a few classes my knuckles started hurting and were turning red from these gloves. I couldn't use them anymore after that. Clearly these are not adequate for even the lightest boxing activity and not even worth the money. Better to buy a better pair than wasting it on these trying to get a bargain."
4,Nice gloves for training,"Nice price for such gloves. However,the wrist part of this glove is not very strong. If you want to use this pair of gloves, you must wear hand warps for more protection."
2,Low quality or QC (quality control) issues,"The stitching at the thumb started pulling apart after only 4 uses of these gloves - about 30 minutes of usage each time across the span of 2 weeks at a boxing fitness class. Even though these are inexpensive gloves, that doesn't mean they should be expected to fall apart after only 4 uses. Either I got a defective pair of gloves, or all of the gloves are just low quality / durability. I think you're better off buying other comparable gloves if possible."
3,Good value,These are by no means the best gloves going around - but I think offer great value. I use them every day for personal training and they get used by men and women alike. They fit most hands and offer good padding. The Velcro strap allows people to adjust the level of tightness and the gloves themselves are reasonably flexible. A low cost product worth investing in for moderate use.
2,there ok,these gloves are ok but however when i punch the bag alot with wrap on i start to feel my knuckles hurt.
4,Boxing Gloves!,"The gloves are very strong and well made, but the zise is unspecified you have to be carefull in order to choose a the rigth zise."
2,Lasted about 5 months...,"These gloves may be good for aerobics, but they only lasted my first 5 months of heavy bag training and some light sparring before the seams started falling apart. The gloves are fine to try to see if you like boxing, but for long term use look for a higher end glove, especially if you hit harder than a 60 year old woman."
2,Good at first but now starting to fall apart,"I got these gloves to use with the heavy bag. I'm just hitting for fitness. Not serious boxing. At first these gloves proved to be good. Combined with hand wraps, my hands didn't hurt after punching.Now after about 2 months of use, once a week, I noticed the right glove seams are coming apart. They're coming apart at the at the outside of the wrist.I'm still using them though. I just wish they didn't start to fall apart so soon."
4,Research is knowledge,"I just started kick boxing so these gloves are fine. However, I didn't realize gloves have different strap lengths. The gloves I received have very short straps. It's hard to fasten the 1st glove and almost impossible to fasten the 2nd glove. Oh well, will research better next time."
3,Not enough padding,Not enough padding for good heavy bag workout. Will wear down your knuckles with these guys- better to buy a more expensive pair and save your hands
1,These Gloves Are Terrible,"I train about 5-6 days a week and needed some new sparring gloves. I saw the price of these Everlast gloves and couldn't resist. Well, I should have. I suppose I should have known these would be poorly made given the price, but I had to try them out. Long story short, I obliterated these gloves after just a couple weeks. The stitching is all ripped up, the thumb is about to come off of the left glove, and the stuffing is coming out. Plus, they have a terrible synthetic smell that I get to enjoy every time I get in my car.Basically, no one should by these gloves. Everlast should do a better job and not make junk like this. Yes they are cheap and yes I train hard and often, but two weeks? Come on."
1,terrible,"I got these when I started and I have bought much better gloves since.Pros-Cheap-Breathable palmCons- hand compartment is very loose. this is dangerous!- Knuckle padding is insufficient- Padding is at a weird angle so there's a gap between the glove and your hand.- wrist support is terrible; handwraps cannot make up for this completely.- fake leather is very thin especially on the palm side- stitching is falling apartIf you plan to use these for more than aerobics, you will hurt your hands and wrists. If you get serious at all, you will probably upgrade within a month or two. Just save your $25 towards better gloves now."
5,Awesome,This was an awesome buy for what I got the same gloves you can go out and buy at a sports store and pay way more vs getting them from here and pay a lot less i train in classes w/ both boxing and kick boxing and there are great very happy w/ my purchase
3,good quality,"Bought these gloves to work out on a heavy bag. Gloves are great, good quality, nice color. The price is a great value. They are rather small. They are made for people with small hands. A petite man or women. I'm 5'2"" 130 lbs. So they we perfect for me. Anyone taller or larger hands, they won't fit"
5,Love these gloves,We love these gloves. My whole family uses them to box each other.We've had them a year and they are still in great shape.
2,Returned them because the gloves were torn when I recieved them from Amazon,"The Gloves had a tear in them when I recieved them, something I think should be checked and looked over before they shipped the products out, could have happen in shipping I don't know but the location of the tear I didn't think so, but I can say Amazon accepted the return with no problem. Also the gloves were a really tight fit for a 16 oz gloves, I ended up re-purchasing from Amazon and got the Protex2 Training Gloves for $18 more but they fit much better. Would not reccomend the Everlast Pro Style Training Glove if you have fairly large hands, my hands are not really huge but average size for a man."
2,ok for begginer,I consider myself as semi trained boxer. My trainer once recomended these gloves but i do not. Im a very heavy hitter there for this gloves last me 3 months then my knuckle which is also wraped will move the paddin. if your a heavy hitter do not purchase these. I have had 2 pairs of these. there cheap there fun but do not hit a heavy bag with these. I used the BLUE 16oz
4,good for his price,Basically a very good pair of gloves. They work very good and are easy to strap. They don't start smelling and they stay fresh. They are easy to put on and they have a little thing to keep the gloves from slipping but not to much to annoy you.
4,Great Gloves For Training!,"I bought these gloves for a boxing class that has weight bags, and it works out great for that! They even have a little opening that allows for air flow."
1,Defective? or cheap? who can know?,"I ordered the 14 oz in red. They fit well, had the right amount of padding for sparring and moderate heavy bag work, and the lining breathed well and didn't smell. After the fourth use, however, they began to split at the seams and the stuffing started to come out. I'd love to think it's because I punch that hard, but I think it's because these aren't made well or are defective. Returning them and buying more expensive gloves."
4,Excellent gloves for beginners,"This is an excellent boxing glove for beginners. Comfortable, lightweight and rugged exterior, perfect for someone who is wants a kick-ass workout."
3,"Good for the bag, crummy for sparring",Bought these gloves as an upgrade to my bag gloves. For hitting the bag they are great but they are too dense for sparring. Sparring with these would be like hitting someone with 10oz gloves.
2,Inadequate,"I bought a pair of these as a workout set for heavy bag use, and have been mostly disappointed with them for that purpose.Pros: Easy on and off, even putting them on by yourself. Wrist straps are simple and hold well. Breathe surprisingly well for the design.Cons: Even with hand wraps on, I found my right glove to fit too poorly to absorb punches well; the design makes it hard to form a proper fist without trying to grip the glove into a proper position to do so. The left I have no problem with for some reason, maybe just have a bad pair? The padding makes blows glance off of the bag to a degree that it made me feel like I was risking injury when using them for actual impact punches. Grips make my hands feel too open when punching, can't grip a tight fist... my hands would be bruised or very sore after even a modest workout with them."
2,Only if you are new to the sport.,"I been training for about two years and these were my 2nd pair of gloves. I kept re-injuring my hand and never knew what the hell I was doing wrong until I purchased another brand. The hand injuries went away soon after I bought the new set. These gloves SUCK unless you are just purchasing them to get drunk and take em out back with some of your buddies in which case, buy two sets."
5,Gloves,"These everlast boxing gloves are great. They come in a nice fit with mesh around the hands for breathing. The solid foam padding is great quality, especially for the $23 I paid for them. 5 stars would definitely recommend."
5,Great Price and Quality,"I recently began boxing classes and everyone, even the coach, has a pair of Everlast gloves. These aren't the high end ones but for the price and quality they can't be beat. Made for a great work out with gloves that fit right. Use the sizing chart for reference and you should have a great fit. I absolutely recommend these gloves for any beginner wanting a decent pair of training gloves."
5,Good for training,"I im new to boxing and dind know the weight that i should buy for my training globes, I recommend this 16oz, they are heavy enough.They fit well, solid and look nice."
4,BOXING GLOVES BLACK,the gloves have a great fit and wish i could find assorted colors. a sure buy better than ebay price
2,No size listed,"I didn't notice when I ordered these that they didn't have a size listed...they came half way down my arm. I was going to return them, but ended up selling them to someone with bigger hands."
4,Works For Me...,"A little tight-fitting to start with (I think that will change with use), but just the ticket for the fitness kick-boxing classes I'm taking at LA Boxing. Not so big and bulky as the 14/16 oz. gloves that most folks seem to wind up with."
3,Was dissapointed,The do have support but they won't stay up. I have to keep pulling and tugging on them. They would work otherwise.
2,"too short, too much spandex (15 not 8)","I am only 5 foot tall but these are too short(medium and large). There is so much spandex that they pinch my toes together actually causing pain. Tried getting large(I weight 125 lbs) but still too short, pinch toes and fall down."
3,Mild Compression,I didn't realize that these were mild compression stockings unntil I received them. But not too bad -- some support was there. Just as easy to take on and off as regular panty hose! If you are needing a mid-strong compression -- these are probably not the stockings for you.
4,hugs my calves for 12hrs,"I am pleased with Jobst compression stockings. No achy calves and no ""cankles"" at the end of my shift. They also stay in place and I don't have to worry about them sliding down to my ankles. I gave this product 4/5 just because I wish I ordered these stockings with a higher compression number."
1,NEVER BUY FROM MedLife Health!!!!!,I purchased this pair of compression stockings and another pair from another dealer for my 84-year-old mother. My mother tried on the other pair and they did not fit her. I tried to return this unopened box of stockings and MedLife Health would not allow me to return them.Jobst makes a good product but this dealer is totally unreasonable!!!! When I tried to get them to reconsider because I wanted to be sure they understood that the box had NEVER BEEN OPENED they would not even respond to me.
4,"Great relief, but thigh-highs are better.","These stockings help my tired, achy legs, but I find that the thigh-highs do a much better job for me. Knee-highs just aren't quite enough support if you stand all day and your legs hurt."
4,comment,"Product was as advertised, and precisely what Iordered rom personal knowledge.No derogatory remarks. Will use same purchase source as needed in future."
2,Pair orderd second time was not good,We got one pair erlier that was fine. Bute then we ordered again one pair and that was already loose in the upper portion and was useless for us.
5,Love these mocs!,"This is my 3rd pair of moosehide mocs. Why 3 you ask? Have them in every color!!!! They are very comfortable, wear great, withstand abuse and can be worn as house shoes or with jeans. Everyone should have a pair!!!"
4,ITs good for the price,Well I got this case about a month ago to upgrade my last broken case. I really liked this case there was a couple things I did not like about it but all in all it was a great case for the price. Once again directions sucked but its a case not that hard to understand. The quick snaps for the bays are kinda annoying but once you get used to it there fine. Front two lights are very bright and look cool. I wish the case had a top fan or vent but its fine. A great case for the price
2,Just So-So,"It's inexpensive and does the trick, but you might want to shop around and spend a little more if you're looking for something nice. Unfortunately, the motherboard I bought (MSI) had the SATA ports coming off of the side instead of straight up, and they ended up being oriented directly toward the hard drive bay. To remedy the situation, I had to cut a slot in the HD bay enclosure to allow clearance for the SATA cables, rendering one of the HD slots useless. I called Ultra's customer service to alert them of the issue, and it was a complete waste of my time. They really didn't care - not that it was their fault (I blame MSI for the issue), but I don't think I will purchase any of Ultra's products again."
2,Poor Construction,This case has a great design but is very poorly constructed. The metal frame is very light guage and easily bent. I received this case in very bad condition. It had all six plastic mounting pins on the front broken off and the case was warped. One side had a bad bend on one corner. I feel sure it was shipped this way because there was a large peice of plastic wrapped around the box to hold it together. UPS may from time to time deliver damaged goods but they do not wrap a big peice of plastic around a box that is obviously dammaged. They have insurance and other ways to deal with this sort of thing.
4,Excellent game,This is my first SOCOM game and it is amazing. Easy and fun to play with. I look forward to buying the game sequels.
4,Great game for PSP,"If you were a fan of SOCOM 1,2, or 3 for PS2 definitely pick up this installment for the PSP. Nothing is really lost in translation to the PSP. Gameplay and storyline are fantastic. Highly recommend adding this game to your PSP collection."
3,A short shooter for the psp,"This game is of great quality. The graphics are good, there are real world weapons, and interesting foes. But it is way to short. Most people can finish the game in a day or two. I however, took time, but it was still easy. The enemies are also slightly dimwited. So if you are looking for a nice tactical shooter, buy a socom for a stationary console, or buy rainbow 6. If you happen to want to buy a short simple shooter, buy this."
4,"""I Can't Believe It's Not Console!""","This game is painfully good. The graphics aren't console-quality mind you, but my God what a fun game. Most impressive is how they nailed the controls on the tricky PSP (no right thumbstick). These controls, (unlike ""Battlefront 2 PSP) are smooth and come like second nature.The missions are cool, and the game is user-friendly as far as the difficulty is concerned.Much, much better than I could have imagined. Fans of the series, or of ""Ghost Recon"" will love this."
2,"Eh, boring.","SOCOM Fireteam Bravo was the first game I got for my PSP. I figured it would be a great FPS game to get my hands dirty. The action was semi interesting, but the firefights I did get into seemed short and uninteresting. I almost always won a gunfight, even on admiral, unless an enemy appeared behind me randomly. None of the missions ever really sparked my interest, and I beat all of the story missions in two days. The additional Instant Action missions seemed thrown together and a waste of time. Guns seemed unrealistic, and they all basically did the same thing. I used little tactics beyond run in and kill all the enemies, or snipe them from a distance. Team commands were sometimes difficult to issue, and Lonestar would not always follow my commands well. I was uninterested in the story and action, and that is why I have rated this game poorly. The game simply does not compare to Siphon Filter- Dark Mirror, which is an excellent FPS. I would suggest Siphon Filter over SOCOM any day."
2,If you like Socom you'll hate this.,"I got this for Christmas and have played it a few times. The concept is totally different than the previous games. If you loved the traditional SOCOM games you will ot like this one. In this game all you do is give the team instructions, that's it. No more head shots! No more unloading your clip in a bad guy! If I could return it I would, it's boring to know what to do and difficult to interact. I will be giving it away or putting it on ebay!"
4,gift,I bought this for my nepheew because he borrowed it from a friend and liked the game alot. He really enjoys playing this.
5,FIRST 3D MILITARY GAME ON A HANDHELD!,It should be dubbed that as it is-unless of coarse the Gizmondo`s Conflict:VietNam came out first i have played a Gizmondo and C:VietNam. as well i have got a PSP and played SOCOM:Fireteam Bravo-I`m not sure which-But the SOCOM game is better-this is not one of these systems vs systems fight-i love the Gizmondo and PSP(AND the Nintendo DS which don`t have a war game but does have Splinter Cell but that don`t count)i just prefer SOCOM:Fireteam Bravo over Gizmondo`s Conflict:VietNam.
4,Something to do when it's slow at work,"Not to bad. Plays well and can get your blood up. Kinda hard to get used to the controls. Pretty fun when you get used to it. I'm looking forward to playing against/with a ""Live"" partner."
1,"I can't believe you would hurt my bank so badly, idiot.","A great way to waste [...], or how about [...]. This game has little to no graphics, gameplay is nothing anyone should want, it lags all the time, even in story (hows that supposed to work, don't ask me), and the only good thing about it is that you can outfit your character.Cons: Almost EverythingPros: The Outfitter"
1,Check your seller before buying,Supposed to be new condition 4 disk set. Received 3 worn CD's and 1 empty case. Buyers beware. Check your Amazon seller performance before buying. I normally do but didn't this time. Amazon came through and resolved the situation.
5,A perfect collection of Cole - NOW RELEASE EVERYTHING!!!!,"That Nat hasn't received the deluxe complete box set is a travesty. Everything that he and his trio recorded for Capitol WAS released in a large box set (which I own, and is out-of-print), but it is HIGH TIME for Blue Note and Capitol to roll out complete sets, similar to Frank Sinatra with his Columbia / Capitol (Concepts) / Reprise treasure chests. Fans have had ENOUGH of the compilations - let's have EVERYTHING chronologically issued. Nat deserves nothing less. Until then, this is a very, very fine collection of Nat's smooth genius. It belongs in yours."
5,Great,This product was very useful and it helped me work with all my different types of pitches. The only problem was that I had trouble setting it up then closing it back up again but you get use to it within time. But I'm very glad there was a prouduct like this to help me out when it came to pitching. I would say my pitching has improved due to this product.
4,armed batman,this batman is a good figure because it has a lot of weapons and the zipline works well if you hold it in both hands and the blaster comes with 4 different projectiles.
4,Obnoxious but it works,"This DVD is a step by step introduction to potty training for a young toddler. My 2 year old loved it, and she is now way more into the notion of potty training. She asks for it over and over now. The music is defiantly more for her than for me as it is quite obnoxious, but if it works I can bare it."
5,My B/G Twins Love This DVD,"Pros: My boy/girl twins are being pottytrained, and this DVD is one of their favorite parts (M&Ms; coming in at #1, this at a close second). They are 26 months old, and like the music and the cartoon characters in the DVD. My daughter asks to watch it every day, and she dances to the ""Go Potty Go"" theme song. My son sings the ""babies wear diapers and that's okay, but I'd rather be a big kid, and do things the big kid way."" Sometimes they sit on their potty chairs together and sing the theme song, which is pretty cute.Cons: It's fairly short, about 20 minutes, so they always want to watch it twice. I also don't like the visuals on the ""Big Kid"" song: they show ""baby shoes"" which are toddler Stride Rite sandals my daughter wears, and being a ""big kid"" is about climbing trees and swinging by yourself (both which my toddlers can of course not do). But they are too young to notice the discrepancies, and dance through the whole thing anyway."
2,Not a good purchase- REALLY bad decision on my part.....,"I am so mad at myself for buying this dvd. It is pretty much pointless.... there's almost no showing of potty use! There are kids swinging on swings, babies in cribs, a COUPLE of short scenes of cartoons using the potty, but that's it. The songs are ok for little ones, but that's not why I bought it. I bought it in the hopes that it would help me (even a little) in the potty-training process, and it definitely didn't do that. Toddlers need more imagery I think- how are they supposed to understand about using the potty if you're singing about it, but showing images of kids playing on a playground? What does that have anything to do with toilet training, I ask you? ARRGG! Very frustrating. Oh well, lesson learned, I guess. I hope you the reader will benefit from my misfortunte and think twice before buying this flick for your little ones."
1,Husband was right,"When we were in the store and I picked this up my husband said ""Really, a potty dvd, we don't need that."" I should have listen to him at least for choosing this one! Like other reviews have said this does nothing for potty training. The songs my daughter does love but they could have been singing about anything and should would have liked the songs. *sigh* another waist of $. I would encourage you to look up some potty songs on the net to sing yourself while trying to potty training rather then these animals."
3,It was ok...,"My 2yr old daughter has been showing potty readiness signs. I decided to buy this dvd because she loves animals. There are lots of bright colors, catchy songs and fun animals, but there was very little to do with the actual potty.I rated this at a 3 because my daughter loves to watch it, but I don't think that its very helpful for our situation."
5,happy granddaughter,my 2 year old granddaughter start watching this video at 16 months and now at 2 she knows that going to potty is something that she must do. she is able to listen when told to use the potty.
1,Useless for potty training,"This video is completely useless for showing a toddler how to use a potty. As a number of other people have noted, most of the video features cartoon ANIMALS either hiding behind bushes to ""go potty"" or dancing around in their ""big kid underwear."" NOT ONCE does the video illustrate pulling underwear or pants up or down, or what happens on the potty or goes in the potty.My 23-month-old has learned her letters, numbers, and colors already from videos, so I thought a video would be the best introduction to potty training. Definitely not this one! She likes the music and characters, but after watching it multiple times she refuses to sit even momentarily on a potty chair (even one that looks exactly the same as the one on the video!) and also refuses to try to pull her pants up or down."
2,"so, so",This video has nice catchy songs and animals which my daughter likes but the animation is very simple. I'm not sure how much she really thinks about using the potty versus just enjoying the music. It's an ok video.
2,Intro to Potty Training,"I have previewed this DVD like I do all material before presenting it for viewing for my toddler grandchild whom I am trying to potty train. Honestly, what was the writer thinking? The target age for potty training is usually between 2 and 3 years, but yet they talk about big kids climbing trees, and riding bikes. Activities that NO toddler would be able to do anyway. This DVD does seem to have gotten fairly good reviews so I will reserve my final judgement AFTER my grandchild has had it for awhile."
1,Useless Film,This video doesn't make my toddler want to take a crap. To be most effective they need to show actuall shots of the cartoon animals letting out hot dumps in the toliet and wiping peanuts and corn off their butt cheeks afterwards.
5,He's Training Himself!,"My 2.9yo loves this video. We rented it from the library so he could gain some interest in using the potty and he has been training himself! He says he wants to watch the ""Panda bears"" and watches it over and over. The songs are very catchy and they are very creative talking about the distinction between a big kid and a baby. I had to buy it so we have our own copy. I definitely give it 5 stars!"
3,Much too short,This book is very short. Some of the information is toward acceptance of the loc style. I feel that if a person is reading this book they are already at the point of acceptance and is looking for information on technique. This book is short on this type of information. I did find it encouraging to learn the beginnings of the loc style. If you are looking for how to perform the loc style. I say look elsewhere.
2,Could have been more informative,"I didn't think this book was that informative. I would have liked to see more pictures in the book. Usually when someone is interesting in locing their hair or becoming a loctician, it is encouraging to see pictures of others who have locs and this book was lacking in that. If you find this book at a library, check it out. However, I wouldn't pay money for it."
3,Schematic Capture with Cadence PSpice (2nd Edition),"Although, I did not open the book to review it before returning it, I believed it deserved at least 3 stars based of my experience with previous books from the author on PSPICE. I returned the book because it did not have the CD and the supporting websites for the book did not have all the files to setup and run OrCad."
5,Delightful Memories of my English Childhood,"This is a book loved by all who have had the pleasure of reading it. Uncle Lubin's persuit of the bag-bird through the pictures of W. Heath Robinson has a truely magical feel. I highly recommend this book for any child who may be at an age to enjoy the vivid imagery.I share a 1902 copy with my sister - it originally came from my school-teacher, great-aunt's house. I remember well going there as a child along with all my cousins. I am now 38 years old. It was then, and still is a firm family favourite.Fans of the BBC's Radio 4 programme 'Desert Island Disc's' would do no better than to take Uncle Lubin with them if given a choice of what book to be marooned with on desert island. However grim the circumstances this book would see you through!As one writer of another review has put it the book is suitable for absolutely all ages. (3 to 100) +I am so very happy that the book is still available."
1,Not Impressed,"I read this book for a college class and I will not think twice about saying that this book is a waste of time. Purdy has amazing ideas, but tends to babble constantly. My professor regretted assigning this book and I regret paying money for it. The chapters are poorly organized and usually do not draw any conclusions or make any connections to previous pages.Please do not think that I am being overly hard on this book. I honestly feel that it is disorganized and simply Purdy writing whatever came into his head."
1,No bells.,"They just rattle a little. There's no bells in them. They're too cheap to send back, but I won't buy from this seeler or manufacturer again."
2,Not as good as others - would NOT recommend,My daughter is 2 years old and we recently got her started on paint with water books. She loves to do them but they are very hard to find in the stores. We have bought the Little People books several times and they are very colorful. Since she had already done 3 of those books we wanted something different and bought the Blue's Clues paint with water book when we saw it. I was very disappointed because the colors were very bland and gray. I would not recommend this book.
1,Terrible!!,"I bought this paint with water book because they are so hard to come by in my area. I had a few others (Care Bears) that were wonderful. This one is simply terrible. The colors disappear as soon as the water hits the paper. With the exception of the blue, which bleeds all over the surrounding areas. I wish I had read the other review first! SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!"
1,"Gave me the ""Blues:","I was excited to find 'paint with water' books for my granddaughter, Lily. This book, however, was of very poor quality. The colors ran together into a muddy greenish brown... I don't think this is worth the cost."
2,Disappointed,"When the children ""painted"" the pages with water, the color was pale and very unsatisfying!"
3,OK water color book,"It's an OK water color book, I've seen better. You really don't get a big change in color when the water is added."
5,It sits next to Gardner's Art of Fiction on my shelf,"Finally, a book about the psychological barriers which writers create and attempt to overcome in the holy pursuit of the word. A great instructive and inspirational book for novice writers."
3,NOT BAD,"A pretty good album considering he releases one every 10 years now or so it seems. Bob's voice isn't the same, rather weak now...lots of backup singers to help, but the songs are fun, if not that memorable. Standouts include ""Lock and Load"", ""Manhattan"". I think he needs a new producer next time around...time to do a bit of an update."
2,Buyer beware,"I heard Seger san music when watching a movie on TV in Tokyo. I'm so impressed that the next day I purchased first Seger CD I saw : ""It's a Mystery"". Unfortunately CD should be called : ""It's Damn Dissapointing"""
4,Rite of passage,Worth price of admission for this track alone. He writes naturally. Sings and plays with just the right feel. His voice suits the music perfectly!
4,A cool album,"IT'S A MYSTERY was released in 1995,four years after THE FIRE INSIDE. The long gaps between albums continue. Well,just the year before,GREATEST HITS was released with 2 original tracks,one of them not penned by Seger. At this time he was already married to his current wife Nita. The Segers had a toddler son,Cole who is presently about 10 or 11 years old. Hits include LOCK AND LOAD and according to the newly released sequel to GREATEST HITS,MANHATTAN. Every song is very good. This is Seger's most recent all-original album."
