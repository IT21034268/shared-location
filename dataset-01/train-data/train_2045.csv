1,not new,"Although the book is a good one, I ordered and paid for a NEW BOOK and received a badly used book. The spine was broken, torn pages and highlighted inside.COME on AMAZON, you know the difference between a new and used book."
2,Hunt like a pro only if you already know the tricks,"This book falls into the uncomfortable middle ground. It's not basic enough to be a good first book and it's not advanced enough to be an expert book. The book suffers from lack of diagrams and in depth descriptions of the subjects that the author glosses over. Although I will admit that he glosses over an awful lot of ground. If you're interested in finding out what you should learn about, this will give you a list. However, if you wanted to learn something about either archery or bowhunting, look elsewhere."
5,Just wonderful,"I cannot begin to describe the genre of this music. It predates grunge and would probably be classified as ""alternative"" for its period.Regardless of the label, it's very well written and very well executed.It's one of the few CD's I have that never gets old and doesn't sound terribly dated."
4,My baby ADORES this dvd,"An absolute fave for our daughter. I only wish it had a few more functional words and a few less words that really aren't important for ""first words."" For example, the word butterfly has a complex sign that there's no way she could learn for a while, but they don't teach words like ""bath"" or ""finished,"" which could be very useful for us now. But all our little girl has to hear is the first twinkle of notes from the dvd's music and she whips her head around and starts going bounce-crazy."
3,"nicely done, but not very useful","I have to say that this DVD is very fun to watch and my daughter (now 20 months) loves it. It is very well made (adorable images and toys), but I was very disappointed in the word selection they chose to teach. There are some useful words, like ""drink"" and ""eat"", but the DVD is mostly signs for animalsor random objects. Where as it is nice to have signs for animals, it is not necessarily very useful. I would have preferred more words like ""done"" (when she's done eating) or ""up"" or ""down"" or ""in"" or ""out"", or even ""please"" for goodness sake!! We enjoy watching this DVD, but I have had to find more signs elsewhere."
3,"My daugter loves this, but.","My 11 month old daughter loves this and she has picked up on a lot of things like dog, cat, book, eat, and more. My only complaint is the ""milk"" sign. She is breastfed so has no idea that milk is white and comes in a carton, or is on cheerios, or is in a bottle. She gets kind of confused when this sign comes on because I do use it when she nurses but, the video doesn't show that."
2,Not that Helpful,"This DVD was just ok. It could hold my 12 month olds attention just for a little while. The only useful signs that it taught were more, eat, and drink. The others were signs like cow. These were signs that didn't really matter in my opinion. If you are looking for a DVD to teach your child sign language so that you eliminate the frustration of knowing what he/she wants you might consider a different one."
3,"Adequate, but not ideal","The DVD does capture the interest of my son. We have watched the DVD many times and my wife and i have learned all the signs, but we continue to joke how most of the signs are animals, such as bear, dinosaur, cow, which are not very useful to us. Our son seems to be picking up a couple of the easier signs (more and dog), but how many times does a 12 month old need to sign ""bird' or ""duck?' We want more signs such as more, all done, milk, eat, that will allow us to usefully commincate.The good news is that the video does capture the attention of our son. We use the chapters to go over certain signs again and again, while ignoring more difficult signs such as ""Bear."""
5,Excellent video for signing,"My 17 month old twins LOVE this video. We don't watch any other TV in our home, but they will ask for this and have learned most of the signs. One of them actually does a little review of his signs each time the video starts playing - it's totally amazing to watch. Plus it is so much easier when they start asking for milk instead of whining, or telling me they want to eat/drink. I have a neighbor who has a deaf daughter and she taught a baby signs class, which was great but this has been even better."
5,GREAT OPTION TO TEACH SIGN LANGUAGE,"I had read about teaching ASL to babies, and bought a book, but I tought I needed a DVD that will help me teach by baby. This was the best option ever! A couple of days before she was 10 months old she started signing dog!!!!!!!! Now she is 13 months old and knows every sign in both videos. She loves to watch them, even though she knows the signs, and even starts signing the next word before the image even appears. It's a shame there are no more videos in the series :(!"
1,Very disappointed,"I read the glowing reviews and ordered this video for my 9-month-old baby. She has no interest in viewing it and neither do I. The choice of signs is a disappointment since twelve of the twenty signs are for animals. The only ones useful to my baby's daily life are milk, more and eat. I wanted a video that included mommy, daddy, up, down, hurt, change or diaper. Those who enjoy the Baby Einstein videos and want to talk to their babies about animals may not be as disappointed in this video as I am."
1,Not very many signs and most of them useless,"I bought this DVD as an intro to sign language for my baby and was very disappointed - there really weren't many signs covered and most of them were not very useful - ""milk"" and ""more"" were the only ones we wound up using to communicate. It is worth the time to teach your baby a few signs, but I would try another DVD."
3,Not useful signs- how useful is the sign for dinosaur?,"The video itself is cute and entertaining but the only really useful signs are drink, eat and more. The rest are animal signs that I could care less if my baby knows- is the sign for duck that important on a daily basis? I would rather have him learn the sign for mommy or daddy or sleep or something like that which is not on this video."
5,THE BEST SIGN LANGUAGE DVD!!!!!!!,"My husband and I purchased this DVD to start teaching our son sign language as well as ourselves. I could not believe how fast he picked up on signing. He was 11 months old when we started and he is now 16 months old and he is signing 14 words like milk, eat, dog, cat, drink and a lot more. :) We are so proud of him and we couldn't have done it without the ""My Baby Can Talk series""!! THANK YOU!!! We can not wait until more and more DVD's get produced!!!! We totally recommend this DVD!!"
5,Good start,"My daughter (7 months) loves it from start. She get happy just when she sees me to put dvd in to tv set. We watched dvds from singing times but she is not able to concentrate for more than 5 minutes. I think those will be for later when she'll be older. even though i miss words like sleep, hurt, play i'm very pleased. i hope i will find those in the second dvd (sharing sing)."
5,I Love This DVD!!!!!!,"We got this DVD about 2 months ago and watch it atleast 3 times a week with my 1 year old and my 3 1/2 year old. Both of my daughters love it. My older child learned how to sign when she was little so we wanted to share the experience with my baby. The results are amazing!!!!! At 12 months old she is signing eat, more, milk, and change (to change her diaper). When my mother babysat the kids this weekend she had to ask my older dtr what the baby was doing when she was signing change, and sure enough she had a dirty diaper. WOW!!! Oh and last night when the baby was up and down every hour and we couldn't get her to calm down I put the DVD in and she calmed right down. Thank you for making this DVD....We love it. My baby is learning how to tell us her needs.Amy mother of Kaitlyn 3 1/2 and Emma 1"
3,"Nicely put together, but . . .","As another person wrote, this video is nicely put together. It holds my 14 month old daughters attention for the entire length of the DVD. however, I was not impressed by the word selection, I was really hoping for words like, ""help, please, thank you"", mostly the words that are on this video are animal names. While they are nice to know, they aren't very useful. Some of the words that are in the video that ARE useful include: ""drink, more, eat"". As I said before, nicely laid out just not that useful."
3,not impressive,"i learned more from websited than from this dvd and my daughter doesnt like it at all. she wont even watch it. some of the basic signs are there, but not as many as i would prefer her to know before learning how to sign dinasaur and cow."
5,Guilt-free entertainment,"My little guy LOVES the My Baby Can Talk series -- he'll stand quietly for 20 minutes at a time, just staring at the screen....sometimes doing the signs along with the people on the video. He's just about to turn one and already knows a handful of the signs -- what a treat to be able to communicate with him!"
5,Brilliant!!!,"Two months ago I purchased the DVD ""My Baby Can Talk"" for Ethan, my 15 month old nephew. Ethan and his mother have a daily commute which enables Ethan to watch the My Baby Can Talk DVD multiple times a day. He LOVES it!! At age 17 months he is able to sign many of the words taught on the DVD, including his favorites; fish, shoes, bird, duck, eat & more. Ethan also uses the signs at the appropriate times in ""conversation"". The My Baby Can Talk video is brilliant!!!"
1,Waste of time,"I must be missing something because this video seems to be getting good reviews. First of all, the video spends most of its time showing pictures of what's being signed instead of the actual signing -- and the children sign so poorly it's unrecognizable -- so my child picked up very little. Secondly, I was hoping to help my child sign so that I could communicate with him during our everyday activities (until he has the skills to speak intelligibly). 90% of the signs are NOT useful on a daily basis. They should have spent less time on signs like bird and duck and more time on signs like help and more. If you want your child to randomly sign the names of a dozen different animals then buy this DVD. If you want to empower your pre-speaking child to communicate their needs then this DVD is a waste of time."
5,A fantastic investment for your child,"WOW!!!!! We watched My Baby Can Talk last night and although Logan is only 5 1/2 months, he was enthralled by your program. It was entertaining, easy to watch from an adult perspective and the attention to detail by adding the quick reference guide was appreciated. My husband thought your selection of vocabulary was very appropriate and simple enough that even he could remember to use it on a regular basis. Logan enjoys watching Baby Einstein and this easily surpasses the Disney standard."
5,it works,"my daughter can sign!!! and she surprises people =) so this is working. i ve been learning how to sign too =D i hope they produce more series.the series includes: cat, dog, bear, cow, milk, drink, eat, horse, read, mouse, dinasours, fish, bird, duck, go, car, shoes, etc (i forgot the rest =p) I dont know how they choose these words as the first signs. maybe it is the most common word? however i wonder why they dont put hurt, potty, stop, or wait in there coz that words sure are useful.the format starts with the REAL object then also to toys. It made the young child learns to associate the toys with the animal/object."
3,"Not too bad, but some major faults.","POSITIVES:This video DID teach my daugher alot of her signs! It really allowed her to grasp the concept, she never caught on when it was just my husband and I showing her. It kept her attention well, and she seemed to enjoy it.NEGATIVES:The little girls that sings does a horrible job (my daughter is considerably younger then her and was doing much better after watching the DVD twice!) and is bad reinforcement. Why show someone doing the signs so poorly that they don't even work as communication?! My daughter would try to imitate her as well as the instructer, and it gets confusing. If they wanted a kid to sign, they should have gotten one that actually could.The signs they show aren't very useful. It isn't often that my 15 month old daughter needs to communicate ""dinosaur"" to us! MOST of the signs are animals, which all babies love, but things like tired, happy, etc. would have been more useful."
5,My Baby Can Talk,My 23 month old loves this video. He is doing great with it. I only wish that I had gotten it sooner!
2,Buy 'Signing Time' Instead,"I bought this video at a consignment shop, as I was interested in introducing consistent sign language to my 9 month old and it was only a few dollars.This video is really terrible. It does cover the basics, but the music, pacing and ways they introduce signs leave much to be desired. The baby in the video also can't make intelligible signs.I was trying to save money and not buy Signing Time, but after two weeks of this, I ordered Volume one of Signing Time and never looked back. My baby could have cared less about My Baby Can Talk, but responded to Signing Time instantly. He was making signs for eat, milk and more within a week.MUCH better options out there."
2,Nice but unnecessary,This was great when I first got it. But shortly after a few uses it got moldy and spotted. I've washed it in the machine several times with bleach and its still stained. I ditched the flap that goes over and into the tub and now just use the knee pad part. It does save my knees from getting bruised up on our tile bathroom floor. But you could just use a folded up towel.
2,Does not wash well,"After following the washing instructions given on the tag, I was disappointed to see that the mat came out of the washer in poor shape. The foam insert was distorted and bent and there is no way to access it to smooth it back out. Also, the velcro snagged much of the surface. I never use the pockets so a regular garden mat or something that is easily cleaned would better meet my needs."
5,Saves my former runners knees,I used to dread giving my daughters baths and now bath time is not a chore at all! This has totally changed our nighttime routine into a much more pleasant one. We actually take time to bond and play now when I'm giving her a bath! Love this!
5,Makes bath time more enjoyable for mom!,"I am very pleased with this product. The kneeler is great (but the towel I was using worked good, too), I am most pleased with the cushion that goes over the tub. Our tub has a sliding glass door so the track for the door digs into my arms while I am leaning over to bath my baby. This cushion works great to ease that discomfort and it is attached to the bottom kneeler part so I don't have to worry about it falling into the water. Highly recommend!"
2,Smells,Comfy but doesn't stay in place. It stains and smells sour after seven months and washing it doesn't solve the problem. I let it air dry after every use but the odor is permanent. It isn't worth the price and now I have to find something else.
4,GREAT product!,"Very well made. Comfortable for mom/ dad; Hubby (with BAD knees) wished the padding was a bit thicker, that's the reasoning for the 4-star rating. Machine washes easy (make sure you follow the simple instructions)- ours gets piddled on fairly often because of the excitement of bath time =). Tucks away nicely when not in use. Definitely a must for any home with little ones and bath time!"
5,I love this!,It really saves my back and my knees! I love the pockets on the front and that it folds up when you're not using it. Also love that the suction cups keep it in place.Edit: I have had this for about 3 months now and it gets awful smelly just from normal use. I put it in the washer about a month ago and it ripped a tiny bit on the knee pad. It is starting to smell again though. A waterproof fabric would have been better material than the absorbent foam-type material that is on it now. I'll just keep throwing it in the washer on delicate every month or so until it becomes completely worn out and then I'll look for a different product.
3,Comfortable but MOLDY,"The kneeler is comfortable, and does help save my knees from hurting during bath time. I was upset, however, when the portion that was hanging over the bath tub got moldy within a few weeks of being used. I put it in the washing machine several times, but was unable to get rid of the mold. I would say if you do purchase this, just fold the top portion under the bottom portion and just use it as a kneeler - don't let it hang over the side of the tub."
5,knee and elbow saver,"My husband and I are not young anymore so this was quite the find. We are both tall and this is a nice wide product. Much bigger than it appears in the picture so it doesn't really tuck away out of sight. We do keep it permanently on the edge of the tub, just use the velcro tabs to put up the knee pads. Elbow padding is good too. It dries quite quickly when the twins splash it while bathing. Washes in the washing machine easily."
4,good for about a year,"This is a great product and works on all bathtubs and even tubs with sliding shower doors attached because it is soft and padded. i recommend it highly as i cannot give my daughter a bath without it anymore. the only problem i had was that after numerous washes, the suction cups on the inside that are supposed to keep it from moving around became loose and eventually fell out. so after about a year, i just bought another one. i tried to contact the company for a replacement and got no reply. not good for customer service....good product otherwise."
5,Saint Francis and His Gift of the Creche,"This story is half about the life of Saint Francis and half about how the first creche came to be.The first part of the book covers Francis' love for the poor, separation from his father, preaching to the birds, and his love of Christmas, which leads into the second half about his creating the first Creche.The pictures are beautiful and simple earth tone paintings that seem to capture what things really looked like at the time when Sr. Francis was walking the streets of Assisi. There are three pictures fully covering their facing pages. On the remaining 2 facing pages of the book there is one page which is fully a picture (except for one place) and the other, on the average has 12 lines of typing taking 1/3-1/2 of the page (sideways). The reading is on a third grade level. I think that it would be enjoyed by young children (3-4 years old) to third grade."
5,"not just a book about what the problem, but how it CAN be healed",This book is a first hand book on the authors own life and his grown up pain that I believe we all have to some degree. It helps you to sort out and identify the part/parts that are a part of the cycle of pain. The author also points you to the solutions for coming out on the side of wholeness and the steps to begin the process.It has my wholehearted recommendation.
1,Too many references to God and the bible for me.,"Once again I purchased a book thinking I'd get something out of it, only to find it loaded with references to God and the bible. This is fine if the Christian religion is part of your life but I prefer a non-religious form of advice. I got a couple pages into it, and as with the other book I'd purchased similar to this, stopped reading when the religious message got too heavy. If you are a Christian or ready to convert to one, go for it."
2,not what i wanted,the book was not what I thought it would be so did not like it.i am going to give to the library.
1,For Evangelicals Only,"This is a truly terrible book that I'm very sorry I purchased. Not only is the advice weak (and vastly different from other excellent books on this topic), but it is entirely phrased from an evangelical Christian perspective. What our ""Creator"" wants us to do is repeated every couple of paragraphs. As you can imagine, our ""Creator"" pretty much wants us to forget the abuse ever happened, and joyfully commune with God's plan. I feel that I was misled in purchasing this book, because it is portrayed as another useful self-help book, and the underlying evangelical message is not mentioned in the reviews. Although you may like this book if you are a fundamentalist, unfortunately, from a psychological perspective, the advice is very very poor. If you are not a born again Christian who believes all we need to do is pray, you will not be helped at all by this book. I'd like my money back."
4,Music Stand,"Very useful, exactly what I needed. Sturdy well constructed although made in China, it servers it's purpose. The carrying bag also well made. They must have a good quality control program."
1,NOT a Belmonte stand!!,"I received this stand today - we bought it to replace our broken Belmonte stand and this one had the same model number as our old one. The stands look very different - this one is a generic of much worse quality. The Belmonte stand we have has a sticker with the brand name, which is missing from this one. Also, the attachments and screws are different shapes and colors. There is not a ""Made in China"" brand on the back of piece that holds sheet music. The included bag says ""Cadence Percussion"" on it . . . sending this imitation back."
3,"Good Quality, but Questionable Length","This product is a quality product. I have washed it numerous times and it has not lost form or fit. The only problem I have with this product is the length, I thought it should have been a little longer."
5,Tasted GREAT!,"These mushrooms were easy to reconstitute and, when used as a component in another recipe, they add an excellent flavor and texture. Before I purchased them, I noticed that one reviewer said that these mushrooms didn't have any flavor, which caused me a little anxiety about ordering them. I believe I know why he/she might believe that is the case. The mushrooms themselves don't have huge amounts of flavor when you pull them out of the soaking liquid. When you reconstitute them, be certain to keep the soaking liquid. DON'T DISCARD IT because that's where most of the flavor is. I suspect that might have been what happened in the other reviewer's case.You can strain the liquid or run it through a coffee filter to remove grit. Then reduce the soaking liquid to add back into sauces or other morel recipes and the flavor can actually become more intense with the reconstituted mushrooms.All in all I'm very satisfied with this purchase, even though they are very expensive."
1,No taste,The mushrooms I received had absolutely no flavor. It was like soaking up cream sauce with pieces of rubber. Really disappointing.
1,This book is another con.,"This book was so bad that it made the Kimes TV movie starring Mary Tyler Moore look like Citizen Kane. The story lacks definition, the characters are completely uninteresting and the writing is worse. Save your money"
1,"Deceptive Title - ""Dust"" Will Leave You Sneezing & Wheezing","Warning - This book has very little to do with dust! Actually, with his book Dust - A History Of The Small & The Invisible Joseph Amato demonstrates an inability to focus on any one topic for more than a paragraph at a time and obfuscates what otherwise should have been a rich and interesting topic below a morass of historical anecdotes. I was thoroughly disappointed. Effective historians have a natural ability to absorb volumes of information, select those facts and events which are important, and weave them into a coherent, interesting narrative. While Mr. Amato's 41 pages of supporting notes and 15 page bibliography suggest that comprehensive research was performed on the topic, no amount of references or notes can make up for his failure to focus on important aspects of ""Dust's"" history and inability to create from them an interesting story. If you are looking for a rewarding, enlightening read, look elsewhere."
1,Not for scientific use,This book was not useful for the purpose I had hoped: it is not a source of scientific reference information.
5,Kids love it!,"I got this for my son and daughter 4 and 5. They love it they both are bilingual, I want them to learn Spanish very well, and this game is great for their learning. It teaches them how to write letters and number, color combining, puzzles, and much more. Im happy with this purchase."
5,Very good conditioner. As good or better than the expensive salon brands.,This is a very good conditioner. I just moved to a humid climate and was looking for a conditioner that would reduce frizz as I have wavy hair that gets frizzy. This product performs very well. Not only does it protect color but it reduces frizz. I am becoming a fan of the entire Burt's Bees line. They make very good products.
5,Excellent sound and inexpensive.,"The harmonica is small, well packaged and packs a punch - it sounds great and is enjoyable to use.This harmonica is inexpensive - not cheap."
5,Good Entry Level,Great entry level mouth harp. I bought it for my 4 year old daughter. Fun to learn on and sounds good too. Also good for the price.
4,Bought it for a toddler. She loves it.,"I am no musician by any means but my little toddler wanted this as she saw at a friend's place. I bought this because it was cheap enough to experiment with. It works fantastic, and I found some tutorials online to make some melodies. Arrived fast with Amazon prime free shipping."
4,Good beginner harmonica!,I always wanted to pick up the harmonica and gave this cheap one a shot. I carry it with myself wherever I go to practice. Just make sure you keep it dry or it'll go bad fast.
5,Lovely!,"I'm more of a guitar junky myself, but this little beginners harmonica is perfect for killing time! Well put together, fun, and easy to travel with! Worth the purchase!"
5,"For the price, a great little instrument",Admittedly I don't yet have ten hours on this harmonica. Probably not even five. But for the price it's a great little instrument. If you are interested in learning this is a great way to start.
2,Very poor instrument,"I've been playing the harmonica for years, and I bought a bunch of these to give out as Christmas presents to my friends' kids (mostly to be cruel to my friends). Of course I had to break out one of them and give it a try myself. They have the same exact body style as an Old Standby, so I thought maybe it was a pretty good buy... until I tried playing it! They're just awful; the tones are flat, the draw and blow characteristics are terrible (lots of air escaping), and even though you can bend on them they just sound terrible. I don't think these things are worthy of an eight year old beginner, much less anybody who really wants to play it! Spend a little more money on an Old Standby, or better still a Special 20, if you're even the least bit serious about getting a real instrument."
4,refreshingly serious and provactive material,"It's nice to see more mature, realistic, and subtle manga being imported. With such titles as Banana Fish on the shelves we just may keep the Sailor Moon hordes at bay. Banana Fish in particular is a solid read, (reminiscent of Akira but without the psychokinetic and apocalyptic underpinnings) and something I'll look forward to collecting in its entirety."
1,horrible,"it's wonderful!! this story is wonderful!! It's about this mafia leader who kills this man, and the protagonist ash, meets the man and the man gives him some powder and says banana fish which incidentally, the brother of ash some time ago said the same thing after going crazy. The story is very good and addicting!!update may 28, 2011-This story is bull *** In the end it's about drugs, and gangs and ash dies, after everything he went through and very stupidly too, I might add..."
4,great idea,"I love this watering can, and used to use it everyday at my old job. I was a plant tech that would go around to offices and care for the office plants. I liked it cause it's spout would rotate in, and I could easily put it in my bag. Only problem was, it leaked where it rotated. I would have to be so careful not to drip water on people office furniture etc. Overall, good for at home or outside."
1,Back to the drawing board...,"I usually adore Good Grips products, but this one fell way short of my expectations. The concept is good, but the execution failed. It leaks at the junction of the spout and the body, and when the spout is rotated around to the over the body position, it unhinges from the threads all together. Very disappointing."
3,"Fun, but limited","This card game is a lot of fun the first time you play it. The sentences the symbols create will make you laugh. I played it with an 8 year old and a 12 year old and we all had fun. The fun is gone however, if you try to play the game again. Once someone has figured out the saying with the picture clues, everyone knows it so the game has no challenge left for the next time you play. It is fun to share with someone who has not seen the cards before, but for continuous game play, it kind of loses it's fun after the first round."
3,"Love the taste, but they break off your teeth!","That said, they are the best tasting things around so if you love a hard, cruchy pretzel, this is your brand! They just taste superb but they really play havoc on my teeth so I really cannot eat them. Or, just soak them in a glass of Coke like the children do and well, you get two treats in one! Highly recommend!"
3,"Good and solid, but hard to hang TV","All I was looking for was a solid basic wall mount. This is certainly that. However, it is very difficult to lign up the two lower tabs of the plate attached to the TV so they go into the slots of the wall side and then get the top hook positioned properly. Then, even if you do get it properly mounted, it is nearly impossible to verify that you have done so because the TV rocks side to side if you wiggle it to see if it is solid. Once I finally, by feel, knew that the tabs were seated and installed the screw that prevents the TV from being accidentally dislodged, it was quite solid.The price was right and the end result was good, but make sure you have someone to help you hook the TV onto the mount."
4,"Good wall mount, great value","I've been using this wall mount for about 8 months now, and it's been great. The tilt really helps reduce the color distortion that some LCD TVs have when viewed from an angle. I'm giving it a 4 out of 5 for two reasons. First, getting the TV pannel onto the wall mount is a little tricky if you're doing this as a one-person job. It's definitely doable, but takes some patience when you're working with a larger TV/Monitor. Second, my TV has the inputs on the bottom/back, and when the TV is tilted the inputs cannot be reached. Of course, if your TV has side or top inputs, this probably won't be an issue. But I would like to have seen a little more clearance between the wall and TV."
4,A must read,"I dont even know where to begin with this book. I could not put it down after i started it. Helen Humphreys presents a captivating novel about the two tragedies in life. The tragedy of gaining your hearts desire, and the tragedy of losing it. This book will compel you as you read the story of 7 people that im sure many of us can relate to as they encounter love and loss in their life."
3,Good story of the human condition,"I agree with most what has already been said about this book. The author's prose is wonderful when telling of the human condition of love and loss ,with relation to the lost of the characters dogs, with the help of those they assume to love the most. Howevr, I also agree that once the identity of the wildlife biologist was revealed, it felt contrived. However, it took me several days to shake the book, especially when some of the words hit the very core of what it means to lose someone we love, and hope they will come back."
2,"The Title Contains the Name EMMA, But Where's EMMA??","If you like Medieval history and the history of continuous Viking raids on England, maybe you'll find this book enjoyable. For me, it was a huge disappointment. The author appears to have no concrete evidence about Queen Emma's public or private life, reign, whereabouts during specific periods in British history, children, marriages, or anything else surrounding the book's main topic. Although a short read, it is dry and without enthusiasm. The book's main subject, Emma, is incidental throughout the entire ""biography."" Emma happened to be the English queen during Viking raids and that's about it. There is plenty of guess-work on the part of the author about what Emma might have done, might have seen, might have said or read, but there's nothing solid or concrete. There are, however, some interesting insights into Medieval life at the time of Emma's reign but that's about it."
3,Queen Emma and the Vikings,"It is difficult to write a positive review of this book. I would not call it good. The writer begins each chapter with a fanciful, novel- style account of what Queen Emma might have felt and done, which, in my view, is out of place in a scholarly work. This is not to be confused with actual historical fact. Also the book is permeated with slang terms that irritate. In addition there is a great deal of detail on subjects that have nothing whatsoever to do with the Queen, such as cures for pimples and warts. These sorts of reminiscences are more in line with a book on the life and times of Anglo Saxon England than with Queen Emma herself. Historical fact on the Queen is thin and is hidden in a lot of extraneuous detail. It is a mildly interesting book, once you get past all the irrelevant detail, but no more than that. In short, the author could have written the details of the Queen's life in half the words she has used."
5,"Easy, Practical. It works","Having to grapple with a language with an entirely different structure to English whilst living in Japan, I chose this book having used the German counterpart earlier. I found `Beginners Japanese' to be perfectly paced & practical for everyday living. Starting out with the basics, Helen Gilhooly teaches you useful Questions & statements in believable everyday conversational situations. Without the use of difficult grammatical terminology, she introduces different ways of using the language & slowly builds up vocabulary which can be applied to what you have been learning. Before long you are making up your own sentences & applying them to necessary situations.If you're into a lot of technical Grammar, then pass this book by, but if you want to learn how to speak Japanese quickly, without necessarily knowing the workings of the language,(I don't know the workings of English!) then this book is a great resource."
4,A Learning Experience,"I thought that this was a really good book, but not quite five star material. I learned a lot of stuff that teachers never really mention in school about the pilgrims. The only down side I found about this book was that it tended to drag at times. All in all, I really liked it. It teaches you a lot about history, and if you really like that kind of stuff, you'll like this book."
4,If You like Pilgrims Read this book!,"The Journal of Jasper Jonathan PierceBy Ann RinaldiDo you ever think you would go back in time and see what it was like to be a Pilgrim? The book talks about the Pilgrims traveling across the Atlantic Ocean. It tells about their troubles. The Pilgrims ran out of food, some people had died of bad sicknesses.I like this book because you can picture all of the characters. You can also picture the Pilgrim's village because the author paints pictures with words.The Pilgrims get to the new land but then how does everything go? Find out."
3,jasper jp,"The Journal of Jasper Jonathan Pierce Our rating: J J J/3 stars out of fiveThe Journal of Jasper Jonathan Pierce, by Ann Rinaldi, is about a pilgrim boy who goes on the Mayflower. When he got on the Mayflower, he left his brother, Tom, behind. Tom and Jasper had different masters and Tom's master didn't want to go but Jasper's did. He writes in his journal to remember Tom. The journal he writes in is about his journey to the New World. We thought this book progressed slowly, because there was too much details. Also, we thought it was boring. But, despite all these negatives, we also liked it. We learned a lot of history. Norman Yu, Tracey Li, Brian Wang, Jeffrey Chan and Julia Chen"
2,My review,"I just finished reading The Journal of Jasper Jonathan Pierce. It was a historical fiction book. I didn't like the book, because it was a boring book and because it was a journal and I don't get those kinds of books.The book was about a boy named Jonathan that had to leave his brother Tom because he was going to America to practice his religion and to baptize too. When he got to America they found out that there were Indians there.Jonathon was a very nice and brave, he stayed strong. They were on the Mayflower."
1,BORING!,"This book was about a boy named Jasper Jonathan Pierce, an orphaned indentured servant who is in search for a better life. (...). This was the worst book I have ever read in my entire life (I have read a lot of books)! This was one of the first historical fiction books I have read and it will be the last! Nobody on the face of the Earth should read this book! It was not exciting at all and I did not like one thing about it!Disgusted Reader"
4,Very Good for the Price,"I actually needed this for a sculpture project but as soon as it arrived, all of my friends wanted to play with it. It got many hours of love before finally being used for my project. It's very entertaining, well made, and a good value."
3,Loved it at first!,"I am a play therapist and purchased this item for my office. I have had three children play with it and three plastic links have broken in half. The sphere is still functional but I don't know for how much longer. The children haven't been rough with it and we have only tossed it back and forth in carpeted area. For the price, I expected it to be more durable. It's a shame because the kids love how it grows and shrinks!"
4,This is a very durable toy,I was suprised at how flexible and strong this product is. I was able to play with it for a long time (and really hard to)and it didn't break. this is a good toy for kids.
1,This toy falls apart!,I had this toy for one week and it completely fell apart! I would like a refund! It is made with such cheap plastic that it breaks from a simple game of toss.
1,BROKE first day!!!!,This is terrible!!!! they both broke the very first day!!!!! I would not buy again! I am surprised that it would break so easily!
4,"Use for ""time outs"" and to ""Slow down""","We use this for ""time outs"" for our preschool/early school ager. Breath in and pull the ball out. Breathe out and push the ball in."
3,Cool for Grown-Ups or Super Careful Kids,"The Hoberman Sphere is a really cool toy. My eight-year-old son loves it. The problem is that it's too fragile for him. If you have a child who is very careful with his toys or if you are buying this for yourself, then that may not be a problem. However, I would not recommend the Hoberman for typical kids who play normally with their toys. The little plastic joints are thin and don't bend sufficiently when bounced or collided with heavier objects. We got the Hoberman for Christmas and it broke apart in less than a week. It still expands and contracts, but now has an entire section missing and really isn't safe to use. There are little sharp pieces where the plastic has broken, so it scratches and pinches. We won't be keeping it. Again, I would say this is okay to purchase if you are keeping it on a shelf in your office and messing with it yourself, but it's not going to last if you give it to your kid."
4,Great fun!,This is a great stress relieving item for your desk at work or at home. Unfortunately it's not really durable enough to be a child's toy.
4,This is pretty cool!,"My office has one of these and it's pretty cool. It doesn't do a whole lot, but it's fascinating to expand and contract the sphere and the colors are bright. It can withstand some rough play, however trust me when I say it doesn't bounce. I'd recommend a little one for every desk, playing around with them is somehow relaxing."
3,No pulleys for mini spheres,"Exactly what I expected except it didn't include a pulley system. I wasn't sure when I ordered, and that wouldn't have changed my order if I knew that wasn't included, but I believe there was wording somewhere about all spheres coming with a pulley system."
4,Kid loves it,"My son always wanted one of these, he wanted a four foot tall one but they are too expensive. He likes it and also likes that is glow in the dark. So far, it's sturdy and seems to be well made. Amazon shipping was very fast as always."
3,Expandable ball toy,"This toy was sold at the Museum of Science and Industry in chicago, IL. My son really liked it so I bought it online because it was less expensive. cool toy but not very educational."
3,Hoberman sphere,"I bought this sphere for my 4 year old girl, she does not play with it on a daily basis but when she plays she has fun!"
2,"Cute, but the full-size one is WAY better...","Check out the full-size ones, they're more fun and educational. This one is more of a Hoberman 'cube' than 'sphere', and it hardly expands in size at all. Get one of the full-size ones if you can afford it, they're way better. They expand to 3x their size, and you can actually do things with them like wear them, little kids can climb through them, and you can make a hanging mobile with them (there's a kit included, cool!). But if you make the mobile, it's permanent. Anyway, to you that thought this one was so amazing, the big one will seriously blow your mind, it makes the little one seem totally lame in comparison."
3,Not really that interesting,"After all of the things I had heard about this, and other reviews, I expected a really great office toy. But it's not. Ok, that it expands is cool -- but it doesn't expand very much, so there is no real ""Wow!"" kind of surprise. There is some fun in opening and closing it -- but no more (and maybe a bit less) than with a Slinky(tm).So, it's a bit of fun but not a whole lot. Best as a decoration that you will rarely pick up and use."
5,Fascinating Object,"I put Hoberman's Sphere on my desk at work and everyone that stops by has to open it up and have a look. It's construction is endlessly fascinating, an amazing puzzle. More information about its construction and the mathematics behind it should have been included on the box, however. And speaking of puzzles, it ought to be offered as a construct-it-yourself puzzle/kit. Detailed instructions would definitely be necessary."
5,Hoberman mini sphere,this was a gift for my 4 yr old grandson .We purchased this same sphere 27 yrs ago for our son and my g-son always wanted to take his home .so we bought this for him...loves it...
4,A little pricey but worth it....,"After trying another brand of LCD TV tuner (and having nothing but trouble) this unit was a welcome change. Gets a nice, clear signal from my cable and the remote is fairly sturdy compared to some of the cheaper models. My only complaints are two: there is no way to adjust the sound output (the bass on my speaker set is way too high) and it shows the Avermedia logo whenever you change the channel. The second complaint is more of an annoyance than anything. I like the PIP feature, and you can change the sound output from TV to PC very easily, making it more useful. Overall, due to the sound issue (which might be more my speaker set), I give it 4/5 stars."
4,Works like it oughta....can't beat the price.,"When you take this out of the box you're thinkin', ""No way, this ain't gonna work."" As Gomer Pyle used to say, ""Surprise, surprise, surprise!!"" Hooked it up, turned it on.....worked like champ. I'm watchin' TV on my 19"" Gateway LCD Flatscreen computer monitor like it was a 52"" plasma. And best of all I don't have to mess with that MY TV garbage Microsoft has in its Media Center software bundle. Only criticism is sparse documentation."
4,Works well,I bought this to use on an old CRT as my TV was used by someone else for a while. It worked very well.I did experience a problem with my unit; it started making a noise over the course of a month or two and I contacted SIIG for warranty coverage. They sent me a brand new unit that had no issues.I actually didn't use my cable box for 8 months or so because I had this. It is unfortunate it does not have more features like allowing you to input/capture the video feed into a computer somehow like through USB but it definitely performed for the purpose I bought it for.
1,Not for me!,"Weirdly thick,tangled, frizzy and dry is all this did to my hair. Even using gobs of the BB's Color Keeper conditioner didn't help. I generally like Burt's Bees products, but this was not for me. It was low lather, and had a faint, but pleasant scent. I ended up using it on my dogs, since I figured it won't hurt them, and I hate to waste something!"
1,Hate it.,"Burt's Bees Color Keeper, Green Tea & Fennel Seed, Shampoo 12 fl oz (354 ml)My hair looks and feels terrible. My scalp has reacted badly to this shampoo. I don't know if I'll even use it on my dog. Her coat is so pretty, I don't want to ruin it."
2,Stripped the color right out,"It's difficult to find a shampoo without SLS, even in color-care shampoos, so I was excited to try this (I also try to use ""natural"" products). Unfortunately, after just a few uses, I noticed that the color seemed stripped right out of my hair. What a waste of money on shampoo AND expensive color! I did like the smell, however, and the low lather was not a problem. Guess I'll donate the remaining product to a friend."
4,I Don't Understand a Word But . . . . .,"I came across La Susi on a compilation CD my girlfriend bought while we were in Spain and loved her track and decided to go out and buy the whole CD. While I am not a flamenco fan I do appreciate to raw passion in her voice, the stripped back nature of the sound and the overall feel of this album. The track 'Amar por amar' got me into La Susi initially but this particular album has grown on me. A little gem."
3,Not something I would buy again,"Leaves lint inside the mag/well. Now use with a patch over it to clean, another to dry, and another to oil. Between the product cost, and high shipping, I wouldn't buy it again."
3,OWL,"Simple cleaning brush for the job. Basically you just need to remove the sand and grit from your mag. If moisture has entered the picture additional swabs and solvent/oil need to to be added to the process. Brush does mat down a bit when dirty but is easily fluffed back into action. Noting special, but fits in and wipes out as intended."
5,A concise and useful guide,"Last summer my family and I traveled in Germany, Austria, and several other European countries, and I wish that we had had a guide such as the German Survival Guide with us then. I would find the material inside the front and back covers very useful. It is quick to locate, and the information given includes the terms and phrases that people need most often. For additional words, the German-English and English-German dictionaries are available at the end of the book. The specific chapter we would have used the most would be Ch. 3 on Restaurants and Food since we frequently ate at restaurants without English on the menu. The other parts that are especially helpful are the cultural notes that are interspersed throughout the book. If we travel in Germany again, we definitely will take this book with us!"
2,Less Survival More Translation,This book although has some good tips has more tedious translations then tips. If I had wanted a book on what to say I would have purchased one.
2,Nice to look at from afar / Keeps baby's arms from slats,"I bought the John Lennon Musical Parade crib set and loved it, so I thought this would be a nice complement for our portable cradle (for those who ask about dimensions, it fits the standard 19x35 cradle). I was really disappointed with the fabric of the blanket and the bumper. It is really cheap feeling material (not at all like the crib set), even after washing. I don't think I'll ever let our baby put it against his skin. I do like having a bumper on the cradle though, because our son would get his arms stuck in the slats of the cradle."
4,3PC John Lennon Craddle Set,"The craddle bedding is great. It washes nice and easy and is a perfect fit for any craddle, boy or girl."
5,Does it fit the Jenny Lind Cradle??,I am getting the John Lennon Musical Parade theme for our nursery. I would LOVE to get this cradle set for the cradle in our bedroom but am not sure of the size. I noticed not all cradles are the same size! Does anyone know if this set fits the Jenny Lind cradle???
1,WARNING!!! Amazon is misleading customers with this photo and vague online description!!!,"I type in Cradle and this product comes up - I like the photo so I order... When the box arrives, I don't receive what is advertised in the photo, I just get a cheap looking blanket for lots of $$$? I return the order and then Amazon charges me for the shipping - My punishment for not reading the fine print and reviews.BUYERS BEWARE!!!"
3,sizes please,I too wish you would put the sizes on this cradle set I am having my husband make cradles for both of my new grandsons and would like to see the sizes
3,OK,"If you are in to westerns and not the hollywood type. I think you would enjoy. But slow moving plot, but maybe accurate."
1,Boring beyond words!!,"This is the most boring, slow, no plot movie I have watched in years!! And the end is stupid beyond words. I thought I had went to sleep and missed something when credits suddenly came on. Don't waste your time on this piece of invented history."
1,Would give zero stars if this was an option (movie with no ending),"(slight spoiler alert) The entire point of this movie is to see what happens to the main characters. Unfortunately like so many movies today, this one has NO ENDING, NO CONCLUSION, NOTHING. While some story lines can support an ambiguous ending, this particular story cannot. In fact, there is not even any ambiguity; the authors don't bother to suggest what happens next. This means that watching all the gritty (and stressful) drama is completely pointless because the viewer never finds out what happens to the characters. Period. Given that the entire movie is about what will happen to the characters in the end, having no ending pretty much means that watching this movie is pointless. Don't bother because it will just make you furious that you bothered to sit through the entire movie. If you want to feel needlessly frustrated, this is the movie for you."
1,If only zero stars were possible...,"Pseudo intellectual's dream. Gritty drama? I don't think so. No purpose, no meaning, no climax, nada...the movie is lost. Waste of a decent evening."
1,meek's cutoff,it was very very boring very little word you don't know what happen at the end did not like it and my family came to oregon on the meek train
5,Excellent Brief Overview of Print Techniques,"Lambert provides excellent brief descriptions of the many printing techniques -- how they work mechanically, where they came from, how they have developed, and the characteristic marks they leave on the paper. Illustrations are well chosen to show off the attributes of the various techniques, with numerous enlargements to provide detail. The technical discussion is generally clear and easy to follow, even if you have never observed the process (electrotyping being the one notable exception). Covers relief processes, intaglio processes, lithography and screenprinting, including modern photomechanical processes relevant to each. Lambert also offers a few observations on the commercial use and development of various techniques, and includes a chapter on paper and a brief, helpful bibliography. A very good overview for newcomers to prints and useful reference for the more experienced."
1,decieved,This item sells on deception. This is for 4 or 2 batteries only. Do not believe the description. If the price is too good to be true--IT IS!!! Be wary when purchasing this item.
3,"Good, but could be better","This book is very informative and great, though it doesn't try very hard to hide it's bias. This was a little disappointing because I'm not sure how much of what it says is based on it's bias or facts."
3,Heroism examined,"Portions of this book are quite interesting and the author does a commendable job of placing the epic tragedy of Scott's final expedition in the context of the early twentieth century world. Most specifically the British world. This is not the best book for a recounting of the events of the expedition. The author assumes familiarity with those events. The bulk of the book examines the immediate and the lasting impact upon the public at large, the Royal Geographic Society and government institutions."
1,Not as it appears.,"I ordered this because it was cheap and I liked the pattern. You get what you pay for as the saying goes. This sheet looked faded and had a strong chemical smell from the packaging, I guess. I never tried this brand before and am afraid to order anything else from this line. Although it was inexpensive, I do not recommend it. Save your money and buy something of better quality."
4,KARATE WKF,"EXCELLENT DVD FOR COMPETITION STYLE KARATE, ALAGAS SENSEI EMPHASIS ON ADVANCE KUMITE BASIC ATTACK AND DEFENSE, COUNTER ATTACKS, FOOT WORK ETC.."
5,"Salaam, An Muslim American Boy's Story","This book is as must read for all folks no matter what age. It portrays the American dream only thru the eyes of a Muslim boy. It is sensitive, provacative, and has superb imagery of life. You must read this book."
4,Rare gem,"There are plenty of reviews so I just wanted to comment on the ""suggested progression"" of preceding this book with ""Creating Motion Graphics"" by the same authors. There is no need to have gone through ""Creating Motion Graphics"" before using this book. At most,I'd recommend this book IMMEDIATELY after Chapter ONE of ""Creating Motion Graphics"" since this book is VERY step-by-step, and when one is just starting out, it is MUCH more helpful to go through several complete and broad projects to get ones feet wet(such as this book) than learning, in depth, a few concepts at a time, which is what you get in the first book if you go through chapters 2 and further. (You might be able to skip the first book altogether if you're already familiar with the adobe interface -- which I was NOT). After completing this book, THEN I'd suggest continuing in the first book at chapter 2 -- so that learning the concepts they teach in depth in that book have more meaning."
3,just a little bit!,"Nice book. Not for dummies but intermediate users.But unfortunately you cant find any words about ""advanced"" keying, matting, rotoscoping, color correcting, and motion tracking-camera matching... These are the most important elements of compositing. After Effects can really do that all but the book doesnt tell in advance. Only basic samples.Some professional case studies in book dont have enough details to deconstruct the final projects, only briefs in secret. Well the book is perfect for midlevel users but not for advanced.Well the writers are preparing a couple of book for the series. We hope they will be more specific and advanced."
4,"Very good, if badly written","Any regular reader of DV magazine will be familiar with the columns from Trish and Chris Meyer. There is no question that they are about as knowledgeable about After Effects as two people can be. The only reason I give this book a less-than-stellar review is that it (like the other two After Effects books in this series) is pretty badly written.This is a common failing for computer how-to books. In order to justify obscene pricing, publishers pad the books with folksy commentary. At best, it's condescending. At worst, it actually obscures the facts about the software that the reader is trying to learn.That said, and taking into account the ridiculous prices, these books are just about the best available for After Effects.One last consideration: If you're prepared to wade through the material, many of the tidbits in these books may actually be archived on DV magazine's web site."
2,Lack of info..,"I purchased chris / trish's first book (creating motion graphics with after effects), exellent book! You'd be hard pressed to find a better book.. So, as soon as this book came out I purchased it. Huge disapointment.. This book is full of tutorials / tips / tricks that almost no one would ever need to know... Not too much info, lot's of fat.."
5,A Road Less Traveled,"This was one of the first books I read on Taoism which described the Taoist life as it actually was lived. Although a scholarly work at heart, like all of Blofeld'd books, it never ceases to delight with wonderful anecdotes and descriptions. Blofeld has a gift for taking what seems at times to be dry, esoteric stuff, breathing life into it and making it shine."
4,A great book for teachers and learners,"Though it is becoming somewhat dated (the only reason I gave this book 4 stars), this text is a great one for a one-semester undergraduate invertebrate zoology course. The book is pitched well for the undergraduate student. One thing that attracted me was the attention Kozloff pays to the smaller phyla, groups that are often given little time and space or are even left out completely in other texts developed for the undergraduate crowd. The line drawings and figures are good. If you are looking for a book to support an ecological/natural history flavor, then check out this book. If you want more emphasis on taxonomy try Rupert and Barnes. If you want an evolutionary approach, try Brusca and Brusca. I have used this book for my Jr/Sr level invertebrate zoology course since it came out and I have been quite happy with it, but if there's not an update in the near future I may need to consider switching texts."
4,A game that also teaches...,Fun for the kids and sort of interesting for the parents as they listen in. A game that also helps them to think and learn...who'd ah thunk it?
5,Still great after all these years,I got this game when I was 10 or 11. I played it constantly and loved it. All my friends in high school had to play with me at some point. I kept it and now I'm playing with my 9 and 10 year old and we love it! It is a quick play so no one gets bored. A few of the topics were not great fits for my family so we took a labeler and changed them. Actors became weapons.
4,So Much Fun!!,My daughters got this game for Christmas!! !LOVE IT!!! We played for about an hour. Tons of fun. I only wish there were more category cards to choose from.
2,Riddled with errors,"I was disappointed with this book. Although it was printed in 2003, it contains many of the same inaccuracies from books printed 30 to 40 years ago. For example, the book says that Yorktown staged four air attacks on Tulagi. Actually, it was only three. The books says that B-26 bombers attacked Crace's convoy. Actually, it was three B-17s. The book says that the Japanese lost a light cruiser. The Japanese lost no cruisers in or around this battle. I could list more. Henry's book does contain a lot of nice pictures, but most of those pictures are now available on the Internet anyway. To anyone looking for a more up to date and accurate book on the battle I would suggest John Lundstrom's ""Black Shoe Carrier Admiral""."
2,a bad sequle to a great movie,Its a very dissapointing movie when the first one was an awsome movie.Ithink the part of the story was where they were robbing the bank was ok but with the vampires it was cheap and wasen't cool at all.The special effects were really fake and the whole movie dragged.This is the dissapointment of the year.
4,"NOT AS GOOD AS THE ORIGINAL, BUT STILL PRETTY GOOD","Although the script isn't as good as the original's, I loved the inventive camera angles and the gore effects! Great stuff! I highly recommend it."
2,"""From Dusk till Dawn"" sequel much less than you'd expect","I loved the way Quenton Tarintino and Robert Rodriguiz fused the western, action, comedy, and horror genres together to create a fast paced, blood soaked original ""Dusk till Dawn."" The sequel is a disapointing spin-off that is much less than I expected. I figured it wouldn't be quite as entertaining as the original, since it's not going to be released in theatres and it straight-to-video. But not even my lowered expectations could prepare me for the low grade garbage that ""From Dusk till Dawn 2"" presented me with. This sequel is obviously just a poor attempt to cash in on (notice the 100 dollar video price?)the inventive Tarintino/Rodriguiz original. More of a trashy and talentless remake than a sequel."
2,It's an average movie but cheap graphics.,The movie would have been better if they would have based the story on something other than bank robbing like part 1. They should have based the movie in revenge of part one. This would have really steamed up the action.
4,1'ST 1 ALWAYS BETTER,"Just like always, sequels arn't as good as the first, still enjoyed it, but spoiled by the 1'ST."
2,Makes the Blood Curdle,"What an awful script - really makes the blood curdle:) I've seen better vampire movies 20 years ago. I did have a good laugh at little things like the BYTE ME car number plate and the length of the solar eclipse. Whoops! I hope I'm not giving too much away. However, I will NOT be giving away my copy of this video. It's part of my ever-growing Robert Patrick collection."
1,spare yourself the agony!,"i would give this movie a negative amount of stars if i were able to. the plot in this movie was completely non-existent. the sole motivation for making this movie was to make another film where all but a few of the ""good guys"" get ripped apart! the only reason any sane person would rent this movie is because it bares the name of the original and they were expecting more then just a pointless blood bath... unfortunately, a pointless blood bath was all that we got! i've seen many B-movies, but this is the worst of any catagorie! a seperate section should be created just for movies as bad as this one! save your money and rent another movie, one with at least a slight plot to it!"
3,"Not so bad, gory and lively","I am surprised at the quite negative criticism this film has received. While not as good as the first FDTD movie, this is a perfectly respect- able direct to video horror production, far better than most direct to video releases. Not so bad as I had been led to believe, gory and lively, nicely photographed and pleasantly over the top, with some good bits of business scattered through the script. The cast is a nice mix of old familiar faces and B-movie stars, I especially liked Raymond Cruz and that old reliable Bo Hopkins (""The Wild Bunch"") as well as the ever popular Danny Trejo. No masterpiece, but a fun rental I'll certainly watch more than once."
4,ok,I recorded this on TV with my Tivo system because it said it was starring Bruce Campbell. It pissed me off when I found out that the only part with Bruce Campbell is a pointless scene in the beginning with Bruce and and the girl from Saved by the Bell. It was also directed by Sam Raimi afiliate Scott Spiegel. I liked the ideas with the camera movement and the scene near the end with the mustard gas and the main character with a cross. Over-all this is a pretty good movie. If it had some better writing and a higher budget it probably would have been better but I guess not. Buy it so you can support these guys.
1,Expensive coaster,"This movie is not worth watching let alone buying. It has poor acting, average plot, bad special effects. If you're expecting a follow on from the first, you will be very disappointed."
1,Huh?,"I think my disgust is amplified by the fact that if involved Tarantino who outside of this piece of crap, seems closely linked to genius. The only events of interest were a very fine rear end and ""El Coyote"" (What does that mean in English). It was so bad it literally made me angry. A slap in the face. An impossibly long eclipse? Absurd stupidity... Right up there with ""Attack of the Killer Tomatoes"". Good grief! Do yourself a favor and watch Dusk Till Dawn and Dusk Till Dawn III and use your imagination to generate your own Dusk Till Dawn II.. Guarantee it'll be a damn sight better than this!"
1,Just... no.,"What can I say?I feel that this is one of those films that I feel is a part of the contemporary polarization. Vampires are either romantic teenagers or nearly mindless killing machines. It's one extreme or the other. No one remembers balance anymore. I miss characters like Dracula who could be charming and occasionally sympathetic but still able to be predatory and vicious. Now that is an interesting vampire. I miss vampires like that.This was low budget, over-stuffed with action and bad special effects and ultimately disappointing."
3,Not Even Close,"Although I am a big fan of vampire movies, this was pretty sad. I say this because the first ""Dusk Till Dawn"" was very entertaining, both funny and sick. This sequel is neither funny or really that sick. I gave it three stars anyway, just because it is a vampire movie. Rent it first, then if you like it make your mind up as to buy it or not."
3,Part one and three are much better.,"Oh Mann, I'm disappointed. This Sequel could be much better. Bruce Campbell (My favourite Actor)is dying in the first 2 Minutes, the Effects are not so good as in Part 1 and I'm missing the big action. The good Sites of the movie are the extremly amazing Camera adjustments and I find the Story a much better as in Part one."
5,Great movie,"I personally thought this movie was great. It has an excellent plot, a lot of violent action scenes, and of course vampires. I suggest you rent first before you buy it. I give it a 5 star rating."
2,more of the same...,"Sequel to the bizarrley popular 'From dusk til dawn'. I found it had its boring moments, but the F/X are not all that bad, although this is your average action/horror type thing, its really a rip-off of the first film."
3,a dissapointing sequel!!!!!,"I myself am a very huge fan of From dusk Till Dawn,and a Quentin Tarantio fan as well,but the lastest installment of From Dusk Till Dawn left me very dissapointing,but the camera angles and effects where great,other than that was pure crap.I can only hope that the prequel ""The Hangman's Daughter"" will be good."
3,Not bad,"This movie was a little different then the first From Dusk Till Dawn. I enjoyed it, I think the ending was weird. The first From Dusk Till Dawn is much better."
2,a fair sequel,"This movie has some flaws. The plot is somewhat weak, the settings are different, Robert Patrick's role is not very entertaining, and this is not a continuation of the first film. If you have seen the original FDTD, view this at least once to see what I am talking about. If you have not seen the original, then you might actually enjoy watching FDTD2."
1,Trash,VERY campy movie that really sucked so badly that I can't believe that work was actually put into it(it certainly doesn't seem like it). No special effects AT ALL but for the opening scene with bats. All the vampires had were green eyes AND THAT WAS IT!. The video store clerk told me it was awful beyond anything we have seen before. We both LOVED the first one though. DONT RENT THIS AND I WILL FEEL AS THOUGH I HAVE SERVED MY PUPOSE!
1,SUCKS!!!,"Why Tarantino would put his name within a thousand feet of this movie is not easily understood. I rented this with a friend, and we both hated it. There are vampire movies, and then there's this. The only thing that makes it is 5 minutes at the beginning with Bruce Campbell."
2,From Dusk Till Dawn 2 - Not as Good as Original,"It seems Quentin Tarantino & Robert Rodrigues wanted to make a franchise series without any thought apart from trying to milk money out of unsuspecting filmgoers. This and the 3rd installment went straight to video so they knew the sequels were not up to par with the original. FDTD 2 is very predictable so there are no surprises, not even the gory vampire killings. The only reason to watch this movie (especially if you're a male) is to see Playboy Playmate Maria Checa in a brief supporting role in which she is killed in a shower scene directly ripped off from Hitchcock's PSYCHO."
1,Terrible!,"This has got to be the worst sequel, ever! This movie is so bad, I don`t even have words describing it!(...)"
2,Mmmmmmm.........,"There are plenty of reasons why this movie sucks, but I'll concentrate on the two most impotant ones. Firstly, sequels to movies like ""From Dusk Till Dawn"" shouldn't be done, everybody knows they will never be as good as first ones, and FDTD 1 didn't allow a sequel with the same characters so you previously know this sequel has nothing to do with with the first one. Secondly, the Tarantino factor. Quent Tarantino had nothing to do with this movie (he didn't write, nor directed it, he didn't even make one of his classic ""little appearences""), so don't expect his wicked twists, dark screenplays, ironic situations and the Kubrickian effects..., although it seems Rodriguez has learnt something of him trough this years and for little moments he hits the spot, that's the reason why I'm giving 2 stars to this sequel (1,5 would be more apropiate). I hope Rodriguez starts aiming a little higher."
1,OMG wasted 30 minutes of my life,"I'd give it zero stars if that was a choice.It was on TV, and I taped it so at least I didn't pay for it and I could fast forward through most of it.It was REALLY bad. Not even worth your time.I would have been more entertained watching a blank sheet of paper."
2,"It was Ok, the first one was much better","I can not believe that it was not as good, This was sort of a disappointment"
1,this sequel wasnt necessary,"From Dusk Till Dawn 2: Texas Blood Money is a total disappointment to the movie From Dusk Till Dawn. This movie had nothing to do with the origonal. If you have the first and want to buy the second save your money, you are not missing aything."
4,A fun waste of time.,"This one is not serious, not for a bit. There's gory slaugther, there are cool characters and there's not even a little tiny piece of a story that isn't forgotten after half the movie.Still I liked it. I liked the wacky camerawork that reminds me of Sam Raimi (Evil Dead) when he is in his most playful mood. I liked the actors interaction (before they became vampires) and I liked the ending scene.What I didn't like was the second half of the movie where there was only fighting, and not interesting fighting. Four criminal vampires just slaughtering polices can be fun for a bit, but not for too long. If you want a stupid movie with high budget where crazy vampires tries to kill other people with no thought of consequences or really no thoughts at all, this is a film for you."
5,Here's blood in your eye!,"This movie rocks!! You Quentin Tarantino ""elitists"" who dissed this movie are a joke. Texas Blood Money is exactly what it's supposed to be; a campy horror movie that has no pretentions to be anything else. There are good visual effects, great stunt work and lots of scares. So what if the dialog isn't Oscar material....it isn't supposed to be."
2,NO DUSK TILL DAWN SEQUEL!!!,"For a regualar B-Movie vampire flick this was OK, but da***t, not a sequel to one of the best vampire flicks of all time. They could have named it anything but From Dusk Till Dawn 2, but America and us sequel crazy people must keep the franchises rolling I guess. It's worth checking out for a vampire flick, but act like it has a different title..."
1,ANYONE WHO LIKED THIS MOVIE NEEDS THEIR HEADS EXAMINED!,"I watched this movie with a bunch of friends expecting it to be of a similar quality to the original - how wrong we were! This movie was dire, the ""Plot"", if thats what you want to call it looked like the actors made it up as they went along, most of the lines sounded ""ad lib"" and the bats looked like they were hanging from pieces of elastic band. The effects were bad even for a B movie, I could go on forever picking this mvie to pieces, but I dont have the time or space to do so, the verall quality looked like something from a low budget tv station. Avoid!"
1,VERY BAD,I LIKED THE FIRST THE MOVIE. IT HAD VERY GOOD EFFECTS BUT THE NEW ONE IS THE WORST MOVIE HAVE EVER SEEN.
2,Mostly standard direct-to-video sequel...,"This film has its moments, but it is otherwise a lost sequel to the awesome original from Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarentino. This film focuses on a group of bank robbers who decide to knock off a score one night. But things go wrong when one is bitten by a vampire and soon the body count rises. Robert Patrick is so-so as our hero, who suspects something's wrong immediately. Some neat camera tricks and plenty of violence abound, but this is mostly a flat delivery and a cheap imitation to the first one. However, the film's opening is excellent with Bruce Campbell in a cameo being terrorized by hordes of bats. This is the film's best moment."
1,AN ENDLESS PARADE OF POINTLESS MASSACRE,"I had HIGH hopes for this film. I loved the first one and watched it more then a million times. I was looking SO forward to this sequel. In the end, it just goes to show that the old saying is right. ""Sequels are never as good as the original"". I cant believe what a piece of foulness this movie is. The only thing I really found excellent was the Sam Raimi-like Camera shots. The movie itself is just boring and a foul mess. I dident enjoy it for a second and I have lost quite a lot of respect for Tarantino. I lost respect for Rodriguez after I saw the Faculty. I just want to tell everyone that this movie has killed a lot of high hopes of hardcore Dusk Till Dawn Fans."
1,A B-Movie Mess!,"Being a big fan of the original film, I intentionally lowered my expectations for this film, considering it was a direct-to-video release. But I wasn't expecting it to be even half as bad as it turned out! What's truly disappointing is that it actually starts out okay, but once the outlaws in the story reach the bank they intend to rob, the entire thing turns into a really bad B-movie vampire thriller with absolutely nothing new to offer as far as genuine surprises are concerned. The only thing that saves this film from being a total waste of time is the amusing appearance by Tiffani-Amber Thiessen and Bruce Campbell (a parody of a more popular horror film's ""gimmick""), and some interesting camera angles. But frankly, if you're bored on a weekend with nothing else to rent, even Howard The Duck would be a far better option."
1,Save your money!,"Such a subpar effort that it doesnt deserve to be released. Why the producers decided to tag the ""Dusk til Dawn"" logo on this crap is obvious, they needed to make a quick bug. If you are a fan of the original, you'll be hard pressed to find anything tying the 2 movies together except for the inclusion of "" The Titty Twister"" from the first film and it only makes a cameo, if you can imagine that. This film lacks the intelligent scripting, funny action and great F/X of the original and replaces it with no F/X and cheesy action you've seen a hundred times before from a no name director I've never heard of. Save your money!"
4,Must be watched before dusk till dawn,"I have read a lot of mixed reviews about this movie and after watching it myself I would say that it is a good film but really I am not a great fan of prequels as they are generally cheap immitations. With an exeption this film was along the same plot and the geko brothers get a little mention, filled with vampires yet again, but some fail to realise that this is a PREQUEL ! So they are thinking how come the bar is open and rebuilt again ! Dusk till Dawn rocks can't wait for Dusk Till Dawn 3 - 'Hang Mans Daughter'"
1,Don't Waste Your Money,I received this book as a gift and was very disappointed in the lack of substance. I agree with a previous post that the book really is all about being nice to others. Hardly a new message!There are much better books out there with real substance. Save your money folks.
5,Nice pictures and stories of triumph,This is a great book for young black males. It has short biographys of several different black males who made it in spite of their challenges in life. It was positive.
1,mostly by Walter Hooper,"The main story contains two chapters by Lewis and the rest by Walter Hooper who tried to make a novel out of the two Lewis chapters many years after the death of Lewis. You can really tell the difference between the two authors. Hooper's chapters contain Americanisms, theological statements opposite to that of the beliefs of Lewis, and a writing style emphasizing physical actions and not thought processes.The dead giveaway is that 20% of the novel contains detailed descriptions of apparatus and their use. Lewis hated with a purple peeve such items in literature.Hooper has also rewritten much of the poetry of Lewis to exclude the allusions to classical Greek and Roman literature.For more information read ""Light in the Shadowlands"" and ""The C. S. Lewis Hoax"". Both books are written by a friend of Lewis."
3,The unfinished fourth Ransom novel,"More well known for the controvesy as to whether 'The Dark Tower' was written by C.S. Lewis, it is nethereless an interesting read, although sadly unfinished. The tale about Ransom and some of his friends, including MacPhee, who observe an alternative universe through a chronoscope. It's highlight is when one of the friends, Scudamour, jumps into the chronoscope and thereby swaps places with his double in that 'othertime'. The novel also contains Christian themes such as self-sacrifice and the problems of addictive sin, i.e. Scudamour wanting to 'sting' his fiancee in 'othertime'. Admittedly not as good as any of the Space Trilogy novels (which is probably why it was not finished), just a glimpse gives us an idea what a completed canonical fourth Ransom novel would have been like. And how different it is to the others."
1,A Dark Joke,"The published, undisputed evidence that C.S. Lewis did not write ""The Dark Tower"", ""The Man Boorn Blind"", and, ""Forms of Things Unkown"" (all included in this collection) is overwhelming. Not to mention that anyone who has read Lewis can easily come to the obvious conclusion that the above ""Lewis"" collection is some sort of spin-off of the real Lewis. On the otherhand, ""Shoddy Lords"", ""Ministering Angels"", and ""After Ten Years"", are obviously genuine."
1,Anyone who says that this is C.S. Lewis is a LIAR!,"( This is all written sarcastically in response to some of the other reviews. )I've read a couple C.S. Lewis books so therefore I am an expert on his writing styles. It is obvious that this is not C.S. Lewis. Everyone knows that like a robot, C.S. Lewis never changed his writing style. True, supposedly this change can be explained by the fact that he didn't finish this story, but come on people, everyone knows that with C.S. Lewis, his early drafts were ALWAYS just as polished as his complete book. Anyone who would even foster the idea that C.S. Lewis wasn't a perfect writer, is insane. An since I am able to know exactly what he was thinking when he was writing his books, I can tell you that he would never write something like this story. Oh, and if you disagree with me you're just stupid and unintelligent, so there."
3,unfinished is good,"The title story, ""The Dark Tower,"" is indeed unfinished. As another reviewer mentioned, several pages are missing in the middle. A little over a hundred pages in, the manuscript cuts off. *Just* at the point where the plot is starting to get interesting.I loved it.I haven't read many such unfinished novels before, but the mystery and intrigue seem all the better for it. Another draw is the story's central character, Elwin Ransom, from Lewis' little-known Space Trilogy. If you can deal with a true literary unsolved mystery, you may enjoy this.Many of the other stories were quite unmemorable, and strangely, several feature central female characters that are annoying, nagging, or otherwise menacing personalities. When judged separately, that may not be problematic but reading them together left a bitter aftertaste."
2,Don't buy this if you're not a Lewis enthusiast,"I was pretty dissapointed by this book. It is not the ""normal"" C.S. Lewis. I was actually relieved to find out that this work is suspected to be forged by Walter Hooper, because I was appaled that C.S. Lewis would turn out a work of this poor quality. It isn't even half as good as the rest of the space trilogy, and the plot is kind of stupid. I have a hard time believing that C.S. Lewis wrote this. I have heard that C.S. Lewis hated mathmatics, and I highly doubt that he would give that subject such a large role and discussion if he did."
3,Collection of published science fiction and unfinished novel,"Lewis never finished two of the stories in this book, and these unfinished manuscripts - THE DARK TOWER and AFTER TEN YEARS - probably would have been better left unpublished as they are not all that interesting. On the other hand, the other four complete stories in this book - THE MAN BORN BLIND, THE SHODDY LANDS, MINISTERING ANGELS, and FORMS OF THINGS UNKOWN - are quite good. If it weren't for the aforementioned fragments, the other four stories would give this book a rating of 9, and I do think the book worth buying just for these alone."
5,The is definitely Lewis,"Some may think this book wasn't written by Lewis, but anyone who has read him can tell the tone and style match him perfectly. Remember folks, he never finished some of the stories in this book or refined them for publishing. Any imprefections can be attributed to that. It was a very good book and I'm sorry Lewis couldn't finish the stories."
3,good/bad,this dvd is extremely good but the disk on sex in space is utter noncense sure it does have some value but it is not interesting enough to be in a good series like this. The disc concerning light speed and paralell universes was extremely good though
2,History channel presents: running out of ideas,"I love this series, I really do, season 1 of the Universe is probably the most interesting thing I've seen on TV. By season 3, it seems as though they've run out of things to talk about. Sex in space, really?? Really?? That episode was only worth watching because of the hilarious space docking visual metaphors they would throw in at appropriate times. Alien faces?? Who cares?!There's interesting stuff here, but it's not up to the quality of the first two seasons. I will still buy season 4 however."
3,A good book for all presidential history buffs.,"Smith does a nice job of showing Hoover as both a politician and a dedicated fund raiser for a variety of charities. He explains in detail many of the problems Hoover faced while in office, and that the depression was not ""cured"" by FDR as many people would have you believe. Obviously, there is an element of bias in Smith's work given that he is the curator for the Gerald Ford museum and a devout Republican. But, he does provide a balance of Hoover's good and bad points; apparrently he wasn't the easiest to get along with which makes sense given his difficulty in dealing with Congress. I wish the book had more detail regarding Hoover's upbringing, although Smith in the introduction noted that was not his intention. I think more background into Hoover as a child and his religious heritage would help put some of his actions and philosophies into better perspective. Overall, I enjoyed reading the book and have gained more respect for this ""uncommon man."""
3,Does not work well with my TV,"I have a Sony KV-32HS500 TV, with a 4/3 screen size. The device only outputs in one format (e.g. 1080i or 720p), which is selectable on the back of the unit. If it would instead output the signal it receives in its native format, then my TV could choose to convert the signal in a way that is optimal for viewing on that TV. For example, if I have 1080i selected on the back of the receiver (which is needed to view 1080i HD broadcasts), and am trying to receive a 480i digital signal, it will convert the 480i signal to 1080i. The picture will get displayed in a small window on my screen because the sony sees a 1080i signal and displays it in widescreen format. If the receiver would output the 480i signal, then the TV would be able to display it on the full screen."
4,Excellent basic tuner,"I haven't experienced the humming problem mentioned by previous reviewers. I can hear a slight hum when I put my ear to the box, but it is not noticeable otherwise. The only weakness I have identified is that it doesn't allow you to letterbox HD programming on a 4:3 aspect set--you have to use a ""full screen"" option that squeezes (and distorts) the picture or a ""zoom"" option that gives you only part of the picture. It comes with component cables that look flimsy, but perform as well as an expensive set I use for my DVD connection. This is an excellent basic tuner for broadcast HDTV, especially if you have a 16:9 set."
1,Broke three weeks outside of warranty.,"Worked great for one year. A week after one year it started puting diagonal colored lines across the entire screen causing complete loss of broadcast picture. By one year and three weeks, this problem would happen without fail after having the unit on for ten minutes. Would DEFINITELY not recommend purchasing one of these units."
4,Kids Love This,"My kids love this game. They have fun, and the dares are silly enough to make them belly laugh."
2,Would not recommend,"I wasn't impressed with this set. There are not a whole lot of activities which can be done pretty quickly- and probably most if not all with common household objects and a magnet or two. If I knew better, I probably would have taken a few refrigerator magnets off the fridge and looked for some fun ideas without buying the kit. The one thing that got ""ooohhs and ahhhs"" was the ""put a magnet on the table and move it with one under the table"" trick. Looks like ""magic"" for a first grader...."
1,Scary to use,Don't buy this! It feels like its gonna suck your eyeball. I tried it once and got scared. U better off using your finger.
5,How easy was that?,Thank u for a simple easy transaction. Talk about hassle free! I got exactly what I asked in no time at all.
2,contact remover,Must be very careful when removing contact lens. I suggest you talk to your eye doctor first before purchase.
4,easy and convenient,The product arrived quickly and was packaged so that there was no problem.I have tried it and works very well.I was pleased with this product.
3,Doesn't work for soft contact lenses,Doesn't work for soft contact lenses. I bought this suction cap in hopes it might also do soft as opposed to strictly hard contact lenses... not it doesn't. Works about as good as using a toothpick.
5,Works great,"These things work great! I just went from soft lenses to rgp, and was having a difficult time removing the rgp lensses. These things took the frustration out of my day!"
2,Not what I expected,"I had a Cannon Sure-shut point&shoot 35mm camera before. It was a very nice camera for my daily general use. Some of the photos I even enlarged to 14x11"" and still looked sharp.However, this Minolta Sightseer I bought (from Wal-Mart though) disappointed me in the following ways:1. Rough resolutions, - it is the worst I've experinced after using many other point-shoot cameras. The lighting conditions have to be perfect to get decent resolutions. Use of slower speed films did not help either.2. Slow recharge time, - when you shoot in dark conditions that require flash, the waiting is too long between shuts. Particularly inconvenient if you are taking photos for children...I would not buy a point&shoot zoom 35mm camera anymore, no matter what brand, but I would by a fixed focul lens one to carry around."
2,Not reliable at all,"I bought this camera with the confidence that a brand like Minolta inspires. It isn't of course one of the sofisticated and expensive Minoltas, but for my amateur purposes, it seemed pretty decent at first sight. It proved to be a disapointment: the pictures are not very clear, especially the portrait type ones, though I was careful not to shoot them from too short a distance, the flesh is too slow. But the surprise was when, after only 27 days of using it,my camera's computer system stopped functioning, without having previousely been subject to any shock. I was still lucky that my purchase receit was not expired, so I returned it to the store. Now I'm looking for another camera, but it will definitely not be a Minolta."
3,Product photo would have helped!,"Unfortunately for me, without a picture I ordered the wrong part. This product simply is a generic set of o-rings for vehicles. There are probably about 20 different ones, ranging in size from very small to VERY large. Personally, I was looking for the oil filter adapter gasket set for a Chevy 350, and this was not it. Oh well!"
5,20 Questions Card Game,I actually thought I was purchasing the 20 Questions Board Game and was disappointed at first but it actually worked out OK. We can play this in the car on trips just to keep your mind alert!
3,"Great, But.....","While we love the game, we miss the original game. While other trivia games provide some fun, the original 20 question game provided hours of fun for a variety of age grougs.This version is great if you're traveling but the number of questions limits the amount of fun that you'll receive."
5,Daughter Loves It,"I bought this book for my 15 month old daughter who is just beginning her bathrooming journey. She loves it! The real pictures of babies and toddlers keep her interested. I just bought it two days ago and we've read it more than 20 times (and she's used the potty for the first time too!). The pages are a great size for her, big, but still managable. She is constantly finding it and bringing it to me.I do wish that it had another girl pictured, as the main character and his older friend are both boys. There is one girl."
1,"Poor, Inaccurate Solaris 9 Study Guide","I'm a Solaris instructor and our firm reviewed this book because it was the first one out and we needed a Solaris 9 training guide for our students; I returned it. In short, here's our review: Gibbs has 3 sentences on managing disks with SMC, nothing on managing core dumps, nothing on Flash archives, nothing on fssnap, nothing on printers, one sentence on smpatch. Gibbs devotes an entire chapter to vi and another entire chapter on basic command syntax- both are not on the exam. Gibbs also includes sections on Admintool and Adminsuite when both products have been discontinued in Solaris 9. Gibbs still refers to SVM as DiskSuite and the book contains numerous typos (ie. syslogc). Gibbs tells the reader to use rlogin, rcp, rsh and does not even speak of the secure shell. I could go on and on about what this book has missed. In short, we started using the Calkins Solaris 9 Training Guide (pub. Que) and our students are getting certified and getting jobs."
3,This book Covers the Wrong exam,This book is for solaris 8 and not for solaris 9.....The exam number has been mispelled throughout the book..Its a good book for solaris 8 though.I studied the whole book to find out this at the end and i have to give the 8 exam ultimately.
1,"Too many errors, too many subjects not covered","The editors must have been smoking when they edited this book. It is full of, not only typos, but also straight-forward wrong information. I should have know that it was bad when they mention the wrong exam number throughout the book!Do not buy this book. I should have looked it up at Amazon and show people's reviews before I bought it."
3,Does not cover some required topics,"I think this book covers Solaris 8 exam very well. But if you want to prepare to Solaris 9 exam you better find some supplementary reading. For example first part of the book does not cover Printer Management, which is a part of the 310-014 exam."
2,Boo!,"This book is more appropriate for the Solaris beginner who is just getting started. I would avoid this book if you are looking to become certified as it skipped some important information, particularly printers.I failed my certification test thanks to this book and the omitted section on printers."
3,"VGA is very ""Universal""","This cable is okay... it works. I'm a little dissapointed that the VGA cable is male on one end and female on the other.The cables come with a VGA gender changer which makes if very ""universal"" if a bit kludgy for female-female (or male-male) applications.The PS2 cables are male on each end, no adapters required."
2,read the book OR read the bible,"Frankly, Dr. Dobson should share with his readers that most of his ""opinions"" are based on biblical stories. I find it offensive that I was searching for answers to questions directly related to a ""strong willed child"" and he saw fit to constantly ""quote the bible"". At a minimum - this should be disclosed to the interested individual prior to purchasing the book (such as on the back cover). Not after!"
1,This man is no Christian.,"Sick. Sick. Sick. WWJD? Protect children from lunatics like Dr. Dobson and his ilk, who have the gall to call themselves followers of Christ. WWJD? One thing's for sure, he wouldn't be an advocate of child abuse."
1,Couldn't read past the first chapter,"This guy starts by telling us how he successfully disciplined his small dog tough a ""passionate"" application of a belt and proceeds to telling us how he was equally successful when the object of this method was his son. Being a dog-lover and a child-lover, and not necessarily in that order, I could not keep reading this call for violence. Those who do not share my sensitivities should still ask themselves why did dog trainers abandon physical abuse in favor of positive re-enforcements to achieve the best results."
1,Not worth the paper its printed on,"Fine for James C. Dobson to instruct parents to bash their kids, now that he's a big person, but I'd still give him a clip round the ear if I saw him on my jib."
1,Approach not for me and my children,"I will never ever beat my children with belts, sticks nor will I pinch their necks in order to obtain control over their behavior. I have a 7 year old son with non-verbal learning disorders along with behavior issues at school. I also have a very typical 3 year old that is strong willed. While I agree that parents can be more successful if they are consistent with discipline - but I cannot understand how anyone could urge desperate parents to beat their children with belts, sticks or pinch them on the back of the neck - and then quote bible scriptures as justification. My christian upbringing does not advocate violence towards children. Children are not evil. They arrive to us in various shapes, sizes, and conditions with the expectation that we will love & nurture them as best we can. Physical abuse is not loving."
5,Excellent Advice,"This book, albeit not perfect, gives some strong and simple advice that any parent can understand. What amazes me is the critics of the book. Basically, these people would be critics of any book that recommends any type of corporal punishment. They call it 'physical violence' but although I was spanked during my child hood years (not all the time but there were some times I needed it) I am a healthy and happy part of society. Please don't read these reviews and believe the comments of child abuse or that Dobson is sadistic. Why not ask his children!? Last time I checked, they were all very well adjusted adults in happy marriages."
1,This person is obviously no Christian,"It amazes me that anybody in this day and age would follow such dangerous advice. It is well known that abuse leads to aggression in children. What Dobson teaches is abuse. He shows a complete lack of understanding of child developement. He shows no care or concern for the welfare of children. His only interest seems to be in reinforcing those parents who wish to have an advocate for abuse.This man is not a Christian. His teaching is in direct opposition to the teachings of Jesus. He does not show even a small amount of the compassion, kindness, or wisdom of the Savior. He is telling parents to turn from the teachings of Jesus, and give into the evil of violence.If you are a true Christian and you want to read a parenting book written by a Christian that teaches Christian values, I would recommend any of William and Martha Sears books.May the love and peace of Jesus live in your hearts. And may you not be decieved by false prophets such as Dobson."
1,"Dobson is scary, and this book is grotesque","I'm thinking about becoming a father soon so I picked this up in thelibrary more as a joke than anything else. This book is exactly what Iexpected, a joke, albeit a sick one. Dobson is no more than ataskmaster with little to no respect for children except as chattel to be passed off by right-wing families. I plan on raising my kid the exact opposite way -- encouraging them to be independent, strong and respectful of others. [He] seems to think wailing on kids is the best way to raise them. Shame on Dobson (I refuse to call him doctor because he doesn't deserve it) for writing such trash, and even more shame on families who would institute such barbarism on their own kids. Dobson is certainly one scary figure. Please, families, look elsewhere for some reason and sanity. This book should be destined for the trash heap but, unfortunately, will probably be viewed as Gospel by some."
4,Dr. Dobson calls parents to Common Sense and Courage,"Boy, there are a lot of parents out there who are afraid to be the bad guys. That's too bad because either you show your child the consequences of bad behaviour or they will learn the much harder way -- bad grades, lack of self-discipline, disrespect for authority, the list is endless.Besides, once your child even THINKS you might follow through with a dreaded punishment, you'll be surprised at how peaceful your home becomes. The yelling and the empty threats can go away, and actual communication and relationship-building can begin to take its place.If my children stay away from drugs and avoid other bad decisions because they are afraid of their parents ""finding out"", that's ok with me. That's the job I signed up for when I decided to get pregnant."
1,A wooden spoon?,"I bought this book in the hopes of trying to control my very strong-willed two year old. I loved this book until I got to the point where Dr. Dobson in all his glory told me not to spank my child with my hand, but instead use a wooden spoon or something of the sort. I truly believe that a hand should be for love but what are you going to do at your friends house? Ask for a wooden spoon and then proceed to spank your child. No thank you. It's illegal to do that and I for one am not going to jail for spanking my child with anything other than my hand. Read the law then compare it to this book! Something is not right!"
1,Child abuse manual,"If your goal is to beat a child into submission, to break them and make them hate you this is the book for you. It is a manual on how to abuse a child from a vocal proponent of torturing children."
1,yikes!!,"as a Christian mom, i have heard alot about dr. dobson, and know that he is well respected in the Christian community as an expert on family issues. i thought his book would be an excellent resource on raising children in a Godly way. however, i felt this book had WAY too much emphasis on corporal punishment. it seemed to be the author's first suggestion rather than a last resort. i know there are differing views on corporal punishment within the Christian community and in society at large, but this book advocates it too strongly. it is hard to enforce a ""no hitting"" rule with your child when your first reaction to his misbehavior is to hit him yourself. it is a mixed signal that is very confusing to a small child. i know alot of people believe strongly in this book as a ""biblical"" approach to child rearing, but i truly hated this book and would not recommend it to anyone. if you want a Biblical resource for child rearing, read the Bible, and seek out other resources."
1,"Great advice, IF","This is a great book, IF: you want your children to grow up to hate you.Most ""strong-willed"" children are probably smarter than you are. Part of that strong will is that they can already think for themselves. They will remember most or all of their childhood (happening NOW) -- and they will damn sure remember whether or not you rely on your physical dominance over them.Kids need love, unconditional love. If you just want them to obey you, this book will help... but it comes at a great cost.Consider the following, fromMan for Himself. This is Erich Fromm, NOT Dobson:""The 'good' child may be frightened, and insecure, wanting only to please his parents by submitting to their will, while the 'bad' child may have a will of his own and genuine interests but ones which do not please the parents.""As a loving parent, you can do better than James Dobson. There are plenty of parenting books out there, pick almost any one over this one - and remember, you're going to be Mom or Dad for LIFE."
1,Why does this man dislike children so much?,"I think James Dobson would do better spending time dealing with his dislike of children then writing this kind of non-sense. For those Christians who are interested in a true Christian perspective on parenting, any book by William and Martha Sears is highly recommended."
1,Approach this book with caution,"I've been a clinical child psychologist for 15 years and thought I'd check this out in looking for good material to refer families to. I would not recommend this book to parents and would actually caution anyone reading this against following much of the advice given. While some of his points are sound, I am afraid I have to worry when a professional quotes the Bible rather than research to support his points. Not knocking the Bible, mind you, but I wouldn't recommend it to someone hoping to gain helpful parenting tips.In my defense, I am not a therapist or a parent who is totally against physical discipline. But this author seems to ignore the negatives associated with it which are well documented. There are better books out there for parents looking for help with their 'strong-willed child'."
1,Beat thy child in the name of God,"The irony here is that if I beat Mr. Dobson for writing this book, I would be the one to going to jail."
1,Bible thumping and using switches on your children,"I agree with the other reviewer that said this book described 'Bible in one hand, a belt in the other' - I was sickened by this book - there's no way in the world I would use a switch on my child and then leave the switch in sight to keep him/her in bed. Horrible. I have a strong willed child whom I've never hit and we are working through it with no problems at all. I would NOT recommend this book and have thrown mine away - wanted to burn it - wouldn't even put it in a garage sale or goodwill for fear someone would actually follow his advice."
4,To keep this short & simple,"this is a good book. It contains some great advice. I won't bother to rehash the rest of the reviews, but I could have done without the biblical references. This book is definately geared towards the christian perspective, and nonchristians might want to choose another book to assist them with their child rearing activities."
1,"Yes, Millions of People Can be Wrong.","I hate, hate, hate this book. Anyone who would hit their dog because she wanted to sleep in a spot James Dobson hasn't designated for her is a bully and should not be writing books on how to raise children. If you want to bully your children and make them think you are a tyrant, this is the book for you. If you want your children to learn to make good decisions for themselves without resorting to hitting them with objects like switches and belts, look somewhere else. Basically his advice boils down to beating the crap out of your kids when they don't do what you want. Apparently, he feels the same thing about animals. He even compares the two when he is relating the story about his dauchshund to how kids should be raised. Yes, you too can treat your children no better than an animal and sell a zillion books. If you want to learn how to really be a parent, this is not the book for you. Can you tell I hate this book?"
5,Arcade Basketball - Who Knew?,"Let me begin by saying: Arcade basketball games annoy me. Usually. If not for the fact that this game appeared on a demo disc I received, I would never have played this gem. Player development makes this game unique, and entertaining. The two play formats are similar, but provide different payoffs. A great game!"
4,"Good game, a couple of problems.","Well this game is good. Many stages to play. But here are some glitches. First off they have a selection of only starters, so if you like a player who plays the bench, then he's not in the game. Second you have this Loser yelling things like ""Deese guys came to play today Yo."" I swear i wanted to break the t.v. screen. But that's about it. This game is pretty good."
2,Not that good of a game,"When I first bought this game I thought it was pretty cool at first. But once I beat the game it just got boring. I think this game is pretty awful. I think they should add more features, like trading players, or tournament mode. So overall this game isn't that good."
3,nba street,nba street is a cool game but the graphics could be alot better if you like street ball you will love this game
4,Solid Basketball but...,"NBA street is a quality game, one of the best in my ps2 collection. but... does anyone remember NFL blitz? how the game would kinda cheat when you started to win? thats what happens here sometimes. I'll be winning by like, 6 points and i only gotta score one mor to win. Then they go on a roll and score 4 twos in a row and win the game!! it stinks!! i get so mad when that happens, i put the game down and dont play it for like 3 days. But anyway, the replay value is good, and i love EA BIG. (ssx tricky is my fav game). So anyway, since its now one of the PS2 greatest hits it's definately worth a buy. peace-and happy gaming"
2,don't be fooled with the cridicts!!!,"This game was fun at first, then I beat it. You know when you beat a game and you feel great about yourself that you beat. Well, then it's not a challenge anymore. You're tired of just looking at it. I don't like. I don't need it. And I'm selling mine who's ever wants it!!!"
2,Lackluster.,"I expected something like SSX's trick system on a basketball court, I mean how could you go wrong with that formula? Obviously EA Sports Big did. This game is a good rental, tops. Buying it is suicide, because I beat it in two days and unlocked all the characters (including the gigantic Chinese guy) and all the courts.What makes this game so lackluster is no four player support, which is a must for any sports game, downright awful play-by-play announcing, and repetitive gameplay. I played it with a friend for a while, but we agreed it lost it's appeal quickly. NBA Jam is still the best hoops game off all time, while NBA Street is only a memory."
5,Best Basketball game ever!,"this game is simply awesome..... the controls are so easy and fluid....... the trick system is great and adds to replayability... this game has awesome courts, awesome graphics, cool characters,illest moves around, and micheal freakin jordan..... i absloutley love this game especially when you play against a friend you can play forever...... after a while single player becomes easy even on hardest difficulty but thats after a while and as stated before this one of teh best multi-player games out........ only bad thing would be the background music... i was so pshyced when i heard it was gonna be hip-hop but its actually pretty weak cause it has a quiet jazzy feel to it not what i was expecting......other than that tiny negative this game rules.... go out and buy it....."
3,A little to easy,This is a great game that i love to play with my friends. The only downside to this game is the fact that it is a little to easy. I beat the game on hard mode in the first two days i had it. After that it wasn't very fun to play by myself. It still is a great game though to play with other people.
4,Great Game but an annoying anouncer!,"This game has all the goods. It is an arcade game (which I usually hate)but with a touch of realism. The graphics are absolutely great, andthe gameplay is even better. If it weren't for that annoying announcer that says the stuppedist phrases like ""who you gunna take on this ride wit you playa"" and other stupid things i would hae given this game a perfect 5 out of 5 stars. This game is a must own."
4,Street Basketball at its best,"This game is a great update to the NBA Jam style of arcade basketball. I enjoyed that I was not as ridiculously wild as NBA JAM, which had crazy dunks and silly moves. NBA street has some great moves, lots of options and plenty of your favorite players. I wish the AI was a bit stronger, as I found I could roll through most anyone with the right team, but all the stat keeping was worth the trip. I even built a great player, which gave me control over his skills. Definately a worhwhile purchase if you like 3 on 3 street ball."
5,EA Big IS definetly Big,"Compared to NBA Live, by EA sports, NBA Street is much, much better. the fact that the best way to score is dunking rocks, and with custom players and a team with MJ, Iverson, and Shaq, how can you lose. the best part is every team you beat, you get a player from the team, like Mourning, Carter, Bryant, Duncan, and Garnet. This is the best NBA game I've ever played."
5,Best b-ball game ever!,"I got this game just a few weeks ago, and it's very fun. Most basketball video games are so realistic, it isn't very fun. This game has a lot of ""video game"" to it, though. It is very fun on multiplayer, and lots of fun on single player, too. It is a very good buy."
5,Finally...,"I generally don't play sports games because they are too much simulation and not enough fun. The last really, really fun sports games I've played were NBA Jam and NFL Blitz, so yeah, it's been a while since I've found another game that I can get into. NBA Street has everything: fun, strategy, customization, and I can put Jordan and my boy Iverson on my squad... I couldn't ask for more. Half of the game is locked when you first start so it's got replay value. I'm a hiphop head but the game's music is annoying. If you turn off the BGM and play to some music from your own collection, then the game is on FIRE. Overall"
5,The best basketball game ever.,"This game is truly the best sports game to ever come out. The best graphics I have ever seen. EA really hit a homer with this one. This is not a conventional b-ball game, here you play 3-on-3 with basketball's legends and street legends. You go around US, playing on street courts of NY, Chicago, and lots of other great cities. This game is a must have and is definitly worth 50$. If you are planning to buy a game, but don't know which one to get, this one is it!!!! It will keep you playing for weeks, and you won't get bored!!!"
5,WOW!!!!!,"Let me just start by saying I got this game two days ago and I haven't put it down since!! It is by far the best basketball game I have ever played. I have found ZERO flaws in the gameplay, graphics, etc.... There are a bunch of different courts to play on, every team is represented, and the street legends are awesome!!!! This game is your favorite arcade B-Ball game mutliplyed by 100. There are ATLEAST 5 or 6 different dunks and dribbling moves that you can use, plus the gamebreaker is sweet, you'll have to buy this to find out what the gamebreaker is!! You can unlock different cheats and create your own awesome player. ...."
4,N B A,"This is a awesome basketball game but is extremely un-realistic (That's why I love it!) If you were a fan of NBA jam way back when then you'll love this game.Grapihcs:9/10 Smooth textures and 3-D background people.Sound:3/10. Okay, the swooshes and the main characters talking are awesome, but the anouncer is unforgivable.replay:8/10. It's basketball, play it again.overall fun: 8/10. With great gameplay that allows you to do sweet unrealistic dunks and controls that are a little different but great this game is definitely worth the money."
4,"Good Game, can't get into it","Well, I read numerous reviews of this game and the general consensus was that it was awesome. I figured, basketball + the SSX trick system must equal a good game. Good it is, but I don't find myself playing it over and over again (like SSX). I would recommend it if you really like basketball. It just seems like a newer, better version of NBA Jam."
5,Great Game,"This is the best basketball game out for the PS2. I didn't even buy NBA Live after playing it a few times, but this game is a keeper.As soon as you play this disc, you'll see great graphics and smooth control play that made EA Sports Big's other game, SSX, such a great hit. This game allows you to do the funkiest moves and plays that you only would see on tv. You know that Nike commercial with the montage of mad dribbling skills? Reproduce those moves with the players in NBA Street.You get to play on great courts with cool characters in addition to NBA players. There are many things to discover in this game on your own. Multiplayer is even better as you try to outfake your opponent. Don't expect realism in this game. It wouldn't be fun if it was. Just expect doing major things you only wish you could do on the court. Overall, a game worth buying and playing over and over. Well worth the money."
1,A cable is missing,This tuner won't work unless you buy on your own an extra pin to pin cable which will connect the cable antenna to the tuner.
2,disappointed,They said that it was the second edition and it's not. I bought the book and probably I'll have to buy the newest edition.
3,It might work and then again it might not...,"I have to say that this book did not help me. I'm not sure why exactly it failed, but perhaps I have only to look no further than my own incurable compulsion with food. Fortunately I was able to have life saving surgery to reduce the size of my stomach. It did, however, still leave me with the same compulstion to eat which I struggle with.However, the idea of this book is a very good one and it just may help you. You have to be willing to work on yourself and you should make that comittment before you read any further or decide to purchase this book. The author seems rather vague in areas in explaining her theories and how they might be applied o anyone else. Tragically, a recent NIH study reveals that only 5% of people who Diet to loose weight are able to keep it off permanently. Therefore, a Diet-free solution is not only convenient, but I believe, neccessary. Perhaps for me a re-read of this book is in order now that I've lost 65 lbs."
5,Fascinating investigation into Van Gogh's life,"This book was written by an investigative journalist who became obsessed with Van Gogh and uncovered a suprising number of details about his life. You'd think that, by the early 1970's, pretty much every aspect of Van Gogh's life would have been known. Such was not the case. Without revealing what he found out, let's just say that the author discovered major revelations about his life that profoundly affect one's understanding of why Van Gogh did what he did. He also discovered that the Van Gogh family did much to cover up the less ""proper"" details of Van Gogh's life."
4,"Takedown, By Matt Christopher",Takedown was about a boy named Sean who gets into a lot of fights. He was good at wrestling and he joined for the first time. He wrestles in three matches and wins the first two; you'll have to read the book to find out whether or not he wins the third match. I liked this book because it was really cool and talked about wrestling and things that relate to my life at school. I urge you to read it.
4,A beautiful film that exemplifies cinematic creativity,"As I walked out of the theatre from this film, my whole being felt moved. It's very simplicity is endearing. The natural beauty of the actors was refreshing. They weren't glamorous or beautiful, and Magali strikes you as almost plain as the film commences. But you still grow to love her carefree spirit and the way she loves her work. In addition, the cinematography is commendable and you just want to drown yourself in the vineyards of France when you see it. There are times when the whole thing just seems droll. You feel as if you are stepping back in time, but not so much that you lose the comfortable understanding you assume with the characters. I love watching this movie, and I absolutely watch it again and again."
4,Simple but really good.,"I don't even know why I liked this movie. There was no tension and the story was simple but I could not stop watching. This director just makes a beautiful movie and the acting is so believable you will forget it is a movie you are watching. I hear he does movies in groups and so I will be looking for the others in this set which I presume to be Summer Tale, etc."
5,love it,"love it. It smells great & works as oil should. I wish I would have bought the bigger bottle, but I wasn't sure if I would like the smell."
3,Diabetes Forecast Magazine,"A good magazine, easy to read and some good recipes. Not sure if I will resubmit another year. Not sure if it is worth the price for what you get."
4,Actually Criticizes Plato,"To my surprise, the author expresses strongly negative opinions towards some of Plato's conclusions, while maintaining that Plato ""asked the right questions.""The author presents Plato as a proto-fascist. Plato's theories of the forms are muddled, and Aristotle was wise to clarify or dispense with them. Laws was a horrid work which formed an unfortunate ending to Plato's writings.I find the author's opinions to be eminently reasonable. His views represent a common-sense approach to Plato. The author, too, asks the right questions."
3,Not as good as other Readiness review books in the series,I bought this book due to the thorough excellence of it's sister Readines Review Exam 70-067 Windows NT Server 4.0 which together with the Transcenders certainly helped get me through the Server exam. This book on Workstation continues a good concept but perhaps lacks some of the clarity and focus of the server book. Don't whatever you do buy it for the accompanying CD Rom which is a heady mix of some pretty confusing questions together with some noticeably wrong answers. The quality of the CD has knocked my confidence a bit so this time I'm definitly on the trail for another study guide.
2,CD-ROM Wrong!,"Overall, the book does give a throrough coverage of the topics covered in the exam. However, my bone of contention is the practice exam on the CD is chock full of errors. My first pass through, I got a total of six questions correct. This came as quite a shock until I went back and started reviewing the questions. One of the more notable mistakes was the answer which claimed that the IP address, default gateway, and subnet mask should be the same on two different machines on a network. This is OBVIOUSLY not correct. Unfortunately, I don't know if my other answers to the questions were indeed wrong, or just marked wrong because the answer key doesn't match."
2,"The CD makes a nice drink coaster, though","The book is okay as a ""flashcard"" resource, but not a primary study guide. Its really almost a moot point since the exam is going to be retired, though. If you, like me, are going back to pick up WS just to qualify for the Accelerated Windows 2000 exam, this is okay for a last-minute, quick refresh just before the exam itself. The CD is pathetic...the screen shots resemble the Sylvan exam engine in a very superficial way, but the questions are useless...the answers are wrong more than not. The book's answers are usually at least correct, but there are one or two that aren't correct. I'm waiting to get my ""official"" score results before I blast MS Press for putting their name on such a shoddy product.By the way, best single resource, in my opinion for initial material is Sybex."
2,"Book has some merit, CD is garbage","While the book has some merit. It is totally lacking in depth of coverage and explainations that Exam Cram books have. The CD is another story, if you check the ""learn now"" feature, it points you to the resource kit or materials other than the book. In addition, answers that are given through learn now pop-up window are completely ignored for grading and many of the questions are graded incorrectly on the CD. (the book does have generally correct answers from what I've seen). As a longstanding MCSE and network professional - Skip this book"
2,USE THE CD AS A TREE ORNAMENT,I MUST AGREE WITH MANY OTHER READERS THAT THE CD IS RACKED WITH WRONG ANSWERS. I IMPLORE YOU TO SEARCH ELSEWHERE FOR MORE REALISTIC AND CORRECT QUESTIONS. HOWEVER THE BOOK ITSELF IS RELIABLE AS A SOURCE FOR WORKSTATION QUESTIONS.
2,USE THE CD AS A TREE ORNAMENT,I MUST AGREE WITH MANY OTHER READERS THAT THE CD IS RACKED WITH WRONG ANSWERS. I IMPLORE YOU TO SEARCH ELSEWHERE FOR MORE REALISTIC AND CORRECT QUESTIONS. HOWEVER THE BOOK ITSELF IS RELIABLE AS SOURCE FOR WORKSTATION QUESTIONS
2,very few questions made to appear as many,"Too much chaff not much wheat. Jill Spealman author of this book executes a convenient technique of using very few questions to appear as many. Many chapters are actually one question with a slight arrangement in the multiple choice answers. For example, Objective 3.2 'Set up and modify user profile' you get asked the same irrelevant question about profiles as they apply to Windows 3.1/NT users throughout the whole chapter.Most chapters use this short change technique.If you are looking for a way to test your knowledge of NT Workstation buy something else. In fact as a recent MCSE,(Which by the way stands for Microsoft's Certain Source of Enrichment) my advice having used them thoughout my studies is stay away from MS Press's books. They are incomplete, uninformative, and filled with mistakes."
4,Worth to buy,"I find this book useful to pass the exam. The book contains enough questions relevant to the exam. It can cover all the topics, and also can give me a clear concept. However, I think that the questions about case study are not good enough. It is not very similar to the live exam, and these questions are a little bit easy.I pass the exam with 900 marks with this book and the training guide by New Riders. Anyway, it is worth to buy it."
4,DIAK65 @AOL.COM Great book to check your knowledge,I took the exam after using this book and the dummies Windows NT Workstation 4 as a study guide because the atec book I had recieved was to dry (boring) and got a 900 on the exam. I really recommend it to anyone looking for another book to use for exam 70-073. GOOD LUCK TO ALL.
3,Too many errors,"Take the troubleshooting section with a lump of salt. The author displays a significant lack of understanding of the difference between impedance and resistance of cable, whether T connectors should read open or short, etc."
4,"Excellent book, pity about the errors.","Excellent book and interactive test, highlighted areas for study that the Transcender tests omitted. However, there were some questions/answers which are definitely incorrect, and others which I suspect are incorrect. Why isn't there a website giving errata? Or, if there is, why isn't it made obvious somewhere in the beginning of the book -- on the title page or introduction? I recommend you study it, but don't take everything as gospel."
3,"Reply to M. Milligan ""UK techno.pop fan""'s ""PRICE!!!???""","M. Milligan ""UK techno.pop fan"", WHY THESE ARE EXPENSIVE, is because they are an import from UK, so they are RARE. You can't normally buy them in America. That's why, like you say, UK shops are cheaper. Do you understand?"
4,This is a fun soundtrack,"I love this show, but I've only heard the soundtrack. It's not your typical musical, and the concept has issues (girls do read comic books, but it's a 99 to one ratio, as in 99 guys to every gal reading comic books). I remember one of the songs from the Tony Awards in 1999!"
4,Finally!! Starmites on CD,"I am glad to finally have a listenable recording of this show. OK not the best score ever written for a Broadway musical, but certainly a lot of fun.Not being able to secure Sharon McNight, the original DIVA, for the recording, the producers have chosen to split her songs between Gwen Stewart and Janet Aldrich (the original Diva understudy), while unusual, I am glad that I get two Diva performances for the price of one.The orchestration is a little thin and sound quality is at times like it was recorded in a tile-lined bathroom, but it adds to the campiness of Starmites. Thank you Bruce Yeko of Original Cast records for rescuing another what could have easily have become one of the lost gems of a theatrical decade."
5,Naw - for Basic Channel lovers,"I found out about Naw on Tomas Jirku's Rivers of Recordings web page, so I was pretty psyched to find a used copy here on Amazon. I also bought their new CD on Tomas' site. It's seriously deep minimal techno dub from Canada. Fans of Basic Channel, Deadbeat, Vladislav Delay, ~scape, and others of that ilk will eat this one up."
4,I too was shocked,"I must admit, like the reader from Bloomington, I too was shocked at the virtuosity of Jethro Tull's output. It is one thing to be an original classic rock icon and contribute so much in that genre, but to help be responsible for a revolution in agriculture as well?Who knew Ian Anderson was such a renaissance man?"
2,"A strange, apologetic summary of Tull","While most books about famous people are either laudatory or condemnatory, this one is completely undecided. I couldn't determine if the author himself felt this way, or was trying for balance. Tull is known for his seed-drill and horse-hoe, which are forerunners of today's havesters, plows, and other farming machinery. This book gives a strange biography, descriptions of seed drills and other implements prior to Tull's work, a brief account of Tull's book and its immediate results, and finally a description of some modern farming equipment. The whole is written in a verbose apologetic manner, as if the author is fearful that either the pro-Tull or anti-Tull contingent will attack him if he says something too plainly or too boldly.There is useful information here, but it was a chore to find it."
2,The Best... for people WITHOUT sensitive skin.,"Typically, I have fond other aloes to leave your skin sticky and tight. This one leaves it smooth and soft. This is great... if you do not have sensitive skin. My husband and I both have extremely sensitive skin and we each use this product. Both of us got a rash where we applied it. It might have great natural ingredients in it but this was not the aloe for us.To get rid of the rash we used Aveeno Calamine & Pramoxine Hcl Cream.Aveeno Calamine & Pramoxine Hcl 1 oz Cream"
4,Decent,"I needed a battery for my Canon EOS 5 (a2e) that takes the 2CR5, and this one had the best overall reviews.PROS- Lasted around 25 rolls (without flash)- Free ShippingCONS- These batteries used to last a lot longer- Only a dollar or two cheaper than local store.More than likely you can find this battery at CVS or Walgreens for about $10, but if you're buying in bulk those two bucks add up! I really feel as though companies are putting less effort into these batteries - they used to last 40-50 rolls.Kodak Max is one of the better 2CR5 batteries around it seems, and I will be buying another in about 25 rolls or so!"
5,Camera Battery,We bought this battery for an older 35mm camera we weren't sure wouldeven work (a gift from a friend). When searching for a battery we foundthe Kodak Max on Amazon.com. It worked perfectly! The product and price were a matchwe found met our needs.
4,"Works great, but wrong brand","I was looking everywhere for these batteries. They are always so darn expensive and the ones I got on here were way cheaper. Just a heads up though, they aren't Kodak brand, they were Panasonic. But besides that, I love them."
5,Stabilo,These highliters work well; the lines are very easy to see. The variety of colors to me is a plus.I have used them in the past which is why I ordered more.
2,WMVHD?,"I could only play it in my computer, it is some weird format. And I have Philips DVD which play lots of european DVDs and USA movies and pictures from my camera with no problem. Don't buy it."
2,Just what we were looking for,"We have tried a number of different pepper grinders through the years and have been less than impressed with the grind of the peppercorn. My husband is a music lover, had grown up with a Vic Firth pepper grinder at home, and so we decided to give this one a try. My own winning element was the design of the piece - it is a complement to my kitchen. The grind is perfect and easy to adjust. I will be using this one for a long time - and am throwing out all the others."
4,Easy technique,"Shotokan is well known for using rigid(not having a flowingtechnique) fighting in order to overcome an agressor. However, thisbook gives some pretty good insight into Japanese self defence."
2,Dexter Womens Softshoe Classic Golf Shoes,"I didn't like the way these gripped the ground. Also, the leather cover was very thin. The second time I wore these I scuffed the white off of the toe. Needless to say I sold these at a yard sale."
1,Does not fit,"This does not fit an Audi 2004 S4 as it says. Found this out too late to return it.Amazon's ""make sure it fits"" search doesn't match Beck/Arnley's website, which says 041-8194 is the correct filter."
3,Worth reading,"The first hundred pages or so are terribly boring, covering the polo-playing businessman Harriman, who, for whatever his better qualities, is quite dull. The book picks up when Harriman enters the world of international diplomacy. While Harriman seemed to have no dazzling insights, his pragmatic approach to diplomacy and the great cast of characters whom he encountered makes the remainder of his biography interesting."
3,Unknown but certainly not unswinging,"They're not the Cats and the Fiddle or the King Cole Trio, but they sure are a hell of a lot of fun. Chances are you've never heard any recordings by this trio, but don't a miss a chance now that they're available. Not all of the tunes are great, but several are including ""Get the Gold"", ""Swinging at the Cotton Club"", both versions of ""Swing Out Uncle Wilson"" and ""If I Had My Way"". These small novelty combos are almost forgotten footnotes of the swing era. It just gives an idea of just how many talented musicians were playing on a nightly basis during the height of the late '30s swing craze."
2,A disappointment,"Renaissance Literature has a very well chosen, wide-ranging selection of material from the period, but unfortunately the production quality is low; it seems as though all the effort went into the glossy cover. The paper is too thin, the print so very small and close together that it really hurts the eyes. Misprints are common. The annotation provided is wildly inconsistent; some items have many useful (if nearly illegible) footnotes, others none at all. If the book were pulled from circulation, re-edited, and re-issued in legible form, it could be an excellent resource, far more ample in content than the dominant Norton Anthology; unfortunately, it isn't really useable as it is."
3,Didn't love,This was yet another item sent to the East coast during Sandy....not really a butter or a creme cheese. He was not so in love with the flavor.
4,Good for the novice or pro,"The book gives you the basics and then goes into great detail on the hows and whys. If you never smoked before, this will help you decide if you want to start and what you need."
3,A useful addition to the library,This book is not particularly well-written but it's full of extremely useful information about smoking meat and building smokers. I shall definitely be consulting it often over the years.
4,more info........,this book has more info. about how to and building smokers. it is a good book to gain more knowledge about it.
3,Meh.,"When I read the official synopsis, I thought this book would highly compliment AD Livingstons'. It didn't. I confused me greatly.It's nice to know the technical terms for how salinty is measured. And I suspect the 3 gents writing this are very intelligent and may even have decided to write this after presenting it as a lecture series or class. But rather than taking the ""Whole part whole"" method for teaching adults, it's very scattered. It confused me greatly and I finally stopped reading it.I honestly haven't looked at their smokehouse designs, but I am guessing they are very thorough and that it would be a good purchase for that alone, if you needed very specific design details."
4,smokehouse design,Great book for understanding how to smoke meat and build several different kinds of smokehouses. Could have been more pictures and illustrations.
3,The caveman would have given up!,"Too much information; badly in need of editing. Endless, almost obsessive, detail and variation on what should be a simple theme. How DID the caveman manage at all? If you aspire to be a smoky hermit in the woods, go ahead; otherwise get a title that sticks to the essentials."
2,Not much useful information here...,"OK, before I get killed here for a negative review, let me first say that this book is VERY in depth! Almost to a point of being like a chemistry textbook! While I learned a little about the principles of smoking meats, I can't say I am any wiser as to HOW it's done, or that I've gained any insight into building a smokehouse... I guess it's a good read for those who want an extensive knowledge on the subject, but for an amateur, it's not much help. As for the design section, it leaves a lot to be desired. It covers both extremes from a cardboard box smoker to a permanent structure costing several hundreds or even thousands to construct. However, there is not much in the middle for us wanting a small, beginner type of smokehouse..."
4,Good To Go,"If your a rookie like myself or someone with some smoking/curing experierience this is a must have book. Everything you need to know about all aspects of smoking/curing. From how to build a hasty smoker or (low budget) in emergency situations to some state of the art smokers. With several illustrations on how to build. The good thing about the book was if you were still in a confused state after reading you could go to the website and read through some of other recipies, then it becomes more clear how to get things done."
4,Links,Links to internet sites for suppliers at the end of the book were particularly helpfull. All were current links.
2,Held up at Knifepoint,"Nice knives for the most part, however, when you pay for a 7-piece knife set, you expect seven knives as well as the included storage block. You might be surprised and a little upset when you open the package to find out that you only get five knives and a sharpener. Believe it or not, the block is the seventh piece. Talk about misleading advertising. The storage block even has another slot for another knife, but when you read the box contents, there it is. ""Seven piece set includes five knives one sharpening tool and storage block"". ""Sabatier Prosteel 7-Piece High Carbon Stainless Steel Knife Set with Block"". ""With block"" indicates that the block is not one of the seven pieces. Think twice before you buy this one. There's a reason it's so cheap..."
3,a note on carbon steel knives,"i don't have experience with this specific knife set, but i wanted to point out in response to the last review that you will have rust with a high carbon knife if it isn't cared for properly, but if you dry it immediately after washing you won't have any problems. In return, you get a knife that will hold a far sharper edge, and will remain sharp far longer."
2,Not worth the price,"I got this for less than twenty while that offer was going on. IMO it wasn't worth the price.The blades aren't too sharp out of the box. One of the knives in my set was also missing.The blades are really thin, and do not cut well even when sharpened. I've had the blade of the chef's knife bend while cutting an onion.Save your money, and spend it on something else. Also, Walmart carries this same set."
3,You get what you pay for.,"The knives have heavy, metal handles, not particularly easy to grip when wet, and not well balanced. The stamped Chinese blades feel cheap, and seem rather prone to bending. They don't hold an edge well, but the thin metal is easily re-sharpened.They do look nice sitting on the counter, but anyone who does any serious cooking will want to spend a little more, and buy something more substantial."
5,Amazing,"These knives are so much nicer that I expected. Good weight and balance. Very sturdy and sharp. Fancy, modern metal and black design. BEST BUY in my book!"
3,sharp but no heft,"Most of the knives arrived sharp, but not sharp enough to glide through tomato skin -- just sharp enough to cut me instead. There is a sharpening steel if you can use it properly. I do not chop quickly with the two larger knives because the blade of the knife bends and can slip when going through dense foods like carrots. I use my Henkles chef's knife for most chopping. The block that comes with them is functional but cheap looking.Update: I have now owned these knives for 2 years. They have not rusted or chipped. I use the two smaller knives regularly; they make it worth the price. That and the opportunity to get familiar with what size, shape, and material of knives I feel comfortable handling."
4,Great knives,My son bought this knives for Christmas and they are really good. I've use all of them and I'm very happy with the gift.
4,Good set of knives for a great price,I've had this knife set for about a month now and they've been working very well. The knives hold a sharp edge and are weighted nicely. The handles are nicely shaped and are pretty easy to grip. This is a very decent quality set for a very VERY moderate price. Be sure to dry them immediately after washing or letting them get wet to avoid damage to the metal. One down side - blade wear. You may need to sharpen frequently if you are a heavy user.Overall - Recommended.
3,Not bad...for the price,"You get what you pay for, but these blades ain't bad. Just bought a set for $19.99, hoping for a bargain. Not exactly a steal, but the knives are sharp (here's hoping they stay that way), and they look cool - at least from a distance (although the butcher block looks third-rate even from across the street). It's true that the blades are a bit thin, and they may not be perfectly balanced, but these should fill the bill for those of us who are happy to cut cleanly through a ripe tomato with ease."
2,Be Forewarned,"I was not prepared for how... um... redneck this production sounds. It makes BIG RIVER (a fave of mine) sound ""citified."" A LOT of WARBLING and drawling and vocal scooping. It's so thick, it actually distracts from the melody and music. But it sounds well-portrayed and energetic and funny. I just wasn't prepared for the kind of musical it is. No negatives intended.""Sleepy Man"" is a beautiful track, and if you love a clear soprano, it's a must-hear (try Emily Skinner's solo CD).I write this review to steer those who may not like hillbilly country music in another direction."
4,"an ""unsung"" musical hero","The Robber Bridegroom is one of a group of little known but wonderfully performable musicals. This recording, which features Barry Bostwick as the romantic hero of this bluegrass fantasy, gives you a little of the freewheeling flavor of the show. Written by the team that went on to give us Driving Miss Daisy, the story is based on a novella by Southern writer Eudora Welty. The bluegrass score is the foundation for this strange, funny, romantic love story, and the characters include a gentleman-by-day bandit-by-night hero, a wicked stepmother right out of a fairy tale, and a pair of bumbling villians, one of whom is a talking severed head! The songs are singable- listen to the lullaby Sleepy Man or the haunting Deeper in the Woods- the plot, hilarious. If you're a music theatre person, give this a try."
4,An excellent underknown musical,"This show should be better known. I think it's just as good as ""Big River"" and in several ways much more complex. One of the few musicals that really combines country and folk and Broadwayeffectively. It's a forgotten gem-- & cast all do a fine job too."
3,Recording is Monaural,"Great show, great cast and performances, but the reproduction on the CD is monaural, which is a shame for such a well-orchestrated, multi-voice score. I haven't been able to find a stereo version on CD -- makes no sense."
4,good,"good, but not his best. Standard favorites.ya ta ya ta ya ta ... Why more words? Why more words!"
2,Copy?,"I chose this gift for my husband. The album skips songs and then goes back to parts of them. My husband commented that this CD must be a Black Market item, as we have sometimes seen in Mexico."
2,"Ray Charles SDounding Like He Did in the 50,s",This CD has poor quality not because it is wore out but it is an old style of recording that sounds weak compared to the rich robust CD's of today. I was looking for something like the CD that came out with the Ray CXharles Movie. Does anyone know the name of that one?
3,The Three Kingdoms,"The show was ok. We learnded alot on Hei but not much on Yuskae I would like to see more ablities on him he is the best charater. Though I am glad we will not see Kuabarra anymore he should be dropped out of the story all together. Kurma will be cool to see his past. I hope Hei and Yuskae and Kurma will be good friends later. I hope, am looking forward to next tape comes out. Feb. 22,2005"
5,Chapin Tribute,"My cassette tape of the Chapin Tribute died years ago. It was so great to hear the songs and words of the entertainers honoring him again. Most importantly, the quality of this used item underscored for me the fact that used is OK. A new copy of Tribute would have cost more than twice as much. I'm grateful that I now own those memories of Harry again."
3,Nat,This product fit picture and description well. It is way to big for a normal size king down comforter though. The edges hang off a good foot all around the edges and looks sloppy. Other than that it is great.
5,Greenhorns and killer Mountains,"Look out Jim Conover is on the scene! This book is fantastic. I absolutely loved. It's a great treasure hunting adventure with characters so colorful you know every one. I couldn't put the book down and when I did I felt like I had stepped out of a movie theatre, not put a book down.If you don't read another book this year, read this one, get to know Clay Morgan and Big Alice and feel as though you've been to the Superstition Mts. in Arizona. This book holds your interest cover to cover. Can't wait for his next book.."
3,Disappointed,"Not sure how this was measured, but It's smaller than 16"". Not want I expected.Disappointed......Not worth the price. bb"
3,"It's ok, but don't spend too much on it","It's fun to be able to drive around wildly through the mountains like a maniac. However, the mechanics of the game are extremely sloppy.One thing that bothers me is how it appears that the vehicles have magnets in the tires that stick to iron deposits in the ground. That's the only way I can explain how you can easily drive up a cliff at 90 degrees. It also explains how difficult it is to flip over when you fly off of something, and the fact that your truck isn't destroyed when you jump off of something that is as high as a skyscraper.The graphics are decent, and the world you can play in is expansive. I got this game used ... and don't mind that, but I wouldn't want to pay full retail price for it. I've played it for one day, then put it down. There may be other games in this genre that are better, as it wouldn't be difficult to improve on this. Still, it can be fun at times, so if you can get it dirt cheap, go for it."
2,Dont waste your money,"I was very disappointed after popping this game in my ps2. As the graphics are somewhat ok, the general handling and realism are far from ok. When you catch mass air on a jump, you land as if you just jumped a gopher hole. The steering is to tight and the general vehicle selection [lacks]. If you are into realistic games like myself, you would have more fun watching a donkey climb a tree. All and all, I wouldn't even pay the shipping charge for this game."
2,This game is a rental.,"It's fun for an hour or 2, and then you're glad you didn't blow your money buying it."
1,Boring.....ZZZZZZ!,"This game is boring....most of the races are the same thing over and over! I have played the one for X-box, and it will let you unlock the moon buggy and the moon level, but the ps2 wont let you! What is up with that?! If any of you gamers out there plan to buy this game.....forget it. Spend your money on something else. If you bought it already, RETURN IT! This game is worthless! If you want a better game, get Midtown Madness 3. That game is way better!"
1,next generation?,"wow! i can't even put into words how bad this game is. initially, i thought it [was bad], but i wanted to spend more time with it hoping that it would grow on me. unfortunately, spending more time playing it only made me despise the developers.graphically, this game is laughable. it easily could have been a first generation n64 game. everything from the attempted reflection effect on the vehicles to the draw distance of the terrain is terrible.the bottom line is that i feel like i already spent way too much time with this game, so I'm not going to waste any more going into great detail about how horrible it is. please, for your own good, rent this game before purchasing it...."
1,Boring,If you're looking for offroad action get smugglers run instead of this lame excuse for a game. It's boring and pointless. Avoid at all costs.
4,pretty cool,"This game is really cool! You get to choose from a buncha different offroading trucks, my favorite being the Hummer. For each offroad vehicle, you can choose between four different stages of each vehicle, with stage 4 being the best and 1 being the worst. You start out the game with a limited amount of money to buy a truck, so you need to earn a lot more money to get a better one. The different stages on each truck need to be unlocked, with 1 being available from the beginning of the game. There are multiple shortcuts on each track, with some being very obvious. There are some insane jumps in the game, and you seem to land correctly every time. Overall, this is a good game for the not-so-hardcore gamers."
5,GREAT!,"I Love this game. It's so original and fun ive been playing it for hours. The graphics in the game arent great but they dont matter this game is too much fun to notice. The game play is great, though very unrealistic it's much better that way. Since the AI in the game if very cheap and unfair when they finally side swipe you and cause you to pull a 360 then you can just go do your thing all over the level. Its also fun because you can literally climb mountains and then jump off of them without damaging anything. The trucks are great, you can chose from a buch of different ones the hummers are awsome especially if you get the unlimited one and you can unlock some really cool trucks too."
1,Not very good...for collectors and avid fans only.,If you simply must have everything Fantasia records then it is interesting as far as a memorabilia item that reflects Fantasia's develoment as a singer. If you're looking for a good Gospel Album ... this isn't it.There's too much good music out there to sink top dollar into this below average amateur sounding CD. Im sure that with the connections Fantasia will make her family will be able to produce something much better in the future.
3,"Without a doubt Fantasia has talent, just needs refinement!","Here's the real truth about Fantasia. Fantasia is a good singer. However, I think she needs to work at refining her range otherwise her sound may end up sounding more like a duck or like Macy Gray instead of Aretha & Patti. I really think Fantasia has a lot of talent but the talent may go UNHEARD if she doesn't get some training in refining her range. That's all! All these other bad things that are being said about Fantasia are from people that are either jealous or just don't like Fantasia on a personal level."
5,A neat idea,"A neat idea. Watson's clear and perceptive review on the nature of smell takes readers into a world that is probably, for most of us, unexplored. But I encourage you to take Watson's journey about how we relate to each other and the animate world, and how it relates to itself-by smell, Watson says. The release or presence of pheromones may dictate our behavior more than we're cognizant of certainly more than we'd probably like to know. Our Jacobson's Organ, located at the top of our nostrils, often guides how we act, for better or worse, unconsciously or not.Imagine: a baby's head produces natural endorphins in those who smell it. Suddenly the behavior of parents around their newborn takes on a new perspective.I question the validity of Watson's view. It SEEMS plausible without knowing much about this field, but it sure was a quality read."
1,Terrible steak knives,"I used to sell cutlery in a kitchen store, and these were by far the worst knives of any kind that I had to sell. The knives are not durable at all. Unlike the higher-end Sabatier knives, these are made in China instead of in France, and you can practically tell just by looking at them that they are of poor quality. Additionally, they rust very easily, even from hand washing. The bottom line: skip these and spend a little more to buy steak knives that you will not have to replace in another month."
4,Adorable pamama,"Really cute Pajama for dogs. My greyhound mix is older and gets cold easy, so we just put this on her and she was comfy... would like to comment, that the pajama was a bit smaller in the chest than we wanted, but were able to make it work. If you can order a size larger for you dog, I would."
5,A Must Read for Christians!,I have purchased multiple copies and give them to friends who are worried about the conditions of the times. It is uplifting and reminds of the promises of Jesus and who is really in charge.
1,sloppy proof-texting,"Before purchasing a book, its best to search the author's blogs(which I failed to do). On his blog Reagan distorts the Bible and denies eternal hell. Here are some of Reagan's crazy quotes:""There is no need to believe in an eternal Hell if the soul is not intrinsically immortal. And it isn't.""""I believe the Bible teaches the unrighteous will be resurrected, judged, punished in Hell for a period of time proportional to their sins, and then suffer destruction (the death of body and soul).PERIOD OF TIME?This is heretic teaching"
1,Jesus and the X-Files,"If you want to read a book which captures the paranoia of the Christian fundamentalist movement, this is the book for you."
5,Love these shoes,I always have a pair of these shoes in my closet. Very comfortable for every day work. Looks great with black dress slacks for the business woman.
3,Franco Sarto,"Franco Sarto shoes are great, but for this specific model, order 1 size larger then usual. It runs smaller then other Franco Sarto shoes."
2,Not the same :-(,"Like many others, I have been wearing this shoe for years and this go round I am more than disappointed. The quality and feel of the shoe has definitely diminished."
2,Very Narrow,"I ordered a womens size 11W, However, I honestly could not even get my foot inside the shoe it was so narrow. I have owned three pairs of this style from Franco Sarto in a womens size 11B, so this pair was either mis-marked, or Franco Sarto has outsourced their manufacture to a company that runs very, very, small."
2,"Nice to look at; but, not comfortable to wear","These shoes are quite stylish for an everday office shoe. The overall look is sleek and kind of dresses up your basic business casual type shoe. Unfortunately, for me, the front rise of the shoe comes up way too high on the foot, causing it to rub uncomfortably against the top of the foot. Shoe has a pretty good slope forward and so feels like foot is being pushed toward toe and that increases the discomfort with the upper. The size was accurate and the shoe quality was good and really wanted them to work out, but after trying them on several times with different trouser socks, nylons and walking around in them for a bit in the house, realized there was just no way they were going to work out for me. Obviously, this could be an issue specific to my particular foot size/shape and preference. They don't work for me, but would be a nice shoe if it works for you.Franco Sarto Women's Bocca Loafer"
3,"No longer the same comfort, leather or cut!","I owned three pairs of Boccas...I think I purchased in 2007...they felt like slippers on my feet.Well Unfortunately this new pair was like a different shoe...looked the same...but felt oh so uncomfortable!! I tried to see what was different. First, they are made in China now and no longer made in Brazil, the leather is not as soft, the cut is ""odd"", and the cushion...not so much...I am shipping them back! PS I also ordered a pair of Clarks Unloops...more casual so not so sure they would work on the job, a little fugly but funky fugly so I like...but comfort...oh...if you can get away with the casualness and the funky look I would get them...they are like slippers!!"
5,Great Shoe for New York City,I bought this loafer to wear in New York - great shoe for walking and goes well with skirt or pants. True to size fit and very comfy right out of the box. This is my second pair
2,Not true to size!,"These shoes are beautiful, but, the Wide is not wide at all. I could not get my foot into the shoe. I do have a high instep, and my fault for not noticing that there were no elastic gores on the side, but I still should have been able to get my foot in. I had to return them for a refund. You really need a low, narrow foot for these."
5,"a must-have shoe, comfy, can be dressed up or down","I have owned these shoes since the mid-90s. I have this shoe in 3 colors (brown, black, navy). When a pair wears out, I replace it. It is my go-to work shoe, getting worn 4days a week on average. The shoe is great for travel, as it's a good walking shoe, but can also be dressed up. It can be worn with jeans as well as dress pants. The wider toe box means my toes aren't crunched. The leather stretches, so if you have a wider foot, the shoe will adjust. It's got a nice amount of support, but I do slip my orthodics in for some extra support."
5,Love them,I love the shoes they are everything I expected. I am going to order the in other color. I can wear them to work or I can wear them with a pair of jeans. Very clean cut and simple.
3,Wide not so wide,I have these in another color in a wide and they fit just fine. These however were not the same fit. Extremely uncomfortable in the same size and width. I was sad because they are a great work shoe. I had to return them and find something else.
2,Order half size smaller,"After reading the reviews, I was very excited to order this shoe since they make size 5. Unfortunately, it was too big. Normally I wear size 5 in major brands (Nine West, Aerosoles, Bass). I was looking at the other styles too if this had worked out. I had to return it with disappointment and they don't make 4.5 for me to order."
5,Great shoes,"It's my fifth pair and I will continue to buy as long as they make them. I was surprised when air travel didn't affect how confortable these shoes feel. They are much harder than most shoes, so if you're looking for a cushion""y"" feel, this is not your shoe. However, they do provide great support, their wide front is ""toe-friendly,"" and they look great with dress pants."
5,3rd pair,"I have had these loafers in brown and black. I am on my second pair of brown (they match the most outfits) and now these are my second pair of black. They are classic styling and COMFORTABLE. I wear a size 11 and am 6""0' tall so I like the heal. Can't go wrong with any FRANCO SARTO shoes, they are all wonderful."
1,very disappointed,I have another pair of Franco Sarto shoes that have held up beautifully. After wearing these maybe a half dozen times the black patent cracked and left wide gaping lines on each side where they bend in which the red lining showed through. Like the look but extremely disappointed.
5,GREAT LOAFERS!,"I love these shoes, they aren't as pointy in the toe so you can dress them up or down. They are super comfortable. They are my go to shoes on days I go without heals. Great purchase!"
5,Franco Sarto,I bought these shoes for myself. I am a fan of Franco Sarto. This is a really good product and well worth the money. Very comfortable! These shipped really fast.
5,Great Shoes!!,"I love these shoes, they fit perfectly.I normally wear a 7 1/2, but these are a 7 and fit perfect.I wish they came in other colors, navy would be nice.I own Black & Cafe Calf.Thank You"
2,Not the same as the old shoe,"I have worn this shoe for years, resoling or replacing as needed, would buy it in any color available. Was expensive, never went on sale, our local famous shoestore would sell several a day. About 5 years ago, they changed the sole to softer, so scuffed the linoleum. Still stayed with them. Now they have cut the price in half, and only the outside looks the same. The inside felt terrible, there are seams where there were none before, did not fit well at all. I would rather pay more, for the old shoe, would not wear these ones if given to me. Cheaper, but not quality anymore. They were returned. Hopefully they will do an Original again."
1,Extremely Disappointed,"Over the years, I have purchased different colors of Franco Sarto Bocca loafers and was very pleased with quality of leather and style of the shoe. My recent purchase of this shoe was very disappointing as the quality of leather looks cheap. When I compared my old Bocca loafers to the new one, the old ones were made Brazil and new ones are made in China and their definitely a big difference in these shoes.Franco Sarto Women's Bocca Loafer."
4,Beautiful classic loafer,"This is a beautiful loafer. I find that it runs a bit big. Even sizing down, my heel slips, but it's comfortable and classic."
5,Great Loafer,"This is my second pair of brown Bocca loafers, I love them, wore the first pair out, after several years. Amazon is great to do business with, when I ordered the shoes, they arrived quickly, upon opening the shoe box, the shoes inside we're not the size marked on the box, I emailed amazon and right away I was given a return postage paid label, then quickly after I received an email saying they'd expedite in sending the correct size, received the shoes the very next day. Love shopping with amazon.com. As for my new Bocca loafers, they're great comfortable shoes. I wear them when I'm going to be walking all over and don't want to wear sneakers, etc. They're classics."
4,Comfy and professional,I purchased these shoes as I own a pair in black and enjoy how comfortable they are and can be worn daily. I wear them with my suits and feel I can't go wrong with a good pair of loafers. Thinking of getting them in navy as well.
5,Great shoe!,"These shoes were comfortable the first day I wore them. The leather is soft so it conforms to your foot and the sizing is right so your foot isn't sliding around and getting blisters. The soles have good traction, even on our building's highly polished floors. I only wear them with pants because they're too chunky to wear with a skirt. Overall a really great shoe!"
5,very comfortable shoes,I love my Franco Sarto shoes. They are very comfortable and the price was very reasonable. I comparison shopped before I purchased on [...]. I also got free shipping which was an added bonus!
1,Teacher's Guide,"Prior to ordering this product I called the customer service department (1-800-818-SAGE) to make sure I could obtain a teacher's guide for the workbook. I was told because I teach high school sociology, not at the university level, I cannot obtain a teacher's guide. Needless to say I will not be purchasing this item. Please be cautious before ordering."
4,great Disney movie,"I don't remember if I have seen this movie before or not. But he's really nice with great actors Pamela Franklin, Vera Mills, Brian Keith and Peter Brown and Sabu.Picture is good condition and in fullframe 4:3. The DVD contains english subtitles!!!!"
2,save the tigers - don't buy this movie,"Although I'm sure no animals were harmed in the making of this film, the tigers were certainly terrorized, and for that reason, I cannot recommend this movie. If you want to see tigers, watch Two Brothers. It's far better than this old thing anyway."
2,Oxford Disctionary of English Etymology,"This book could be useful for a serious etymologyst, but it is very difficult to decifer unless you are willing to spend hours learning all of the abbreviations. It is organized like a dictionary. The entries give the current dictionary definition of each word, and then proceed to trace the evolution of the word. This evolution is often difficult to understand because of the previously mentioned abbreviations. This book is for a dedicated linguist, or someone with much patience and time"
1,not much etymology,"I own different dictionaries and by far Oxford dictionary of... is on the bottom.No dictionary is perfect but when I see etymology in title Iexpect etymology inside.One example--police;where I expected to see itsroots from Greek,no luck,instead dictionary gives the difference in pronunciation in parts of Great Britain.My wild guess is the authorsare not familiar with term etymology."
3,Somewhat disappointing.,"I have found this book to be only a supplement to my Webster's College Dictionary. Most of the etymology I am looking for is in my regular dictionary. I have found some slight expansions of the folk influence on words, but basically I check my dictionary first. Fortunately, I used a gift certificate so I didn't pay the full price of the book myself."
1,Not what we expected,"We thought this would be a book about the origin of words and phrases, not a dictionary. It is called a dictionary of English ETYMOLOGY, after all. But it's more like a regular dictionary. We were a bit disappointed."
5,Like new again...,"Save the environment. Replace your shaver screen and cutters instead of tossing your shaver. It's very easy to do, and cheaper than buying a new shaver."
5,You'll need this every 6 months,"if you have the shaver, you will need this every six months. Have a spare standing by as the screens on the shaver can fail without warning (chewing your face to bits)."
2,Foil wears out fast,Foil wears out fast.Buying replacement foils for this razor every four months or so has me thinking of switching to another brand.
5,Husband loves it!!,My husband got this for his shaver and it works like new again. He no longer says he has cut himself with his old shaver head. It really shaves close. He is smooth after he is done. I am so happy we ordered a new one.
4,Good cheap replacement foil/cutters...,These actually seem to cut better than the original cutters. My original cutters were damaged when I dropped my razor and were only a couple of months old. These are decent cutters for the price.
3,"Remington Replacement Screens & Cutters for units MS-5100, MS-5200, MS-5500, MS-5700",The razors do not seem to have the same quality from the original ones that came with the unit. But it works OK.
5,More of an attack manual,"It is true that if you like learning lots of theory, then this book may not be enough. But clearly this is not a reference book. Features I like:(a) SUMMARIES at the end of each chapter come down with definite conclusions as to which lines are the best for white.(b) It is a good book to buy if you want to purchase a SINGLE BOOK as an ""attack"" treatise, middlegame manual and your opening book for white. This is due to its large collection of Hodgson games.(c) It covers 1...d5 2 Bg5 for those bored with the QUEEN'S GAMBIT.(d) It covers lines that are most likely to come up in practice not obscure ones. He clearly understands how the club player playing black would naturally react. This is important for me as I am a medical student and DON'T HAVE TIME to study lots of variations.(e) There is a definite sense of ENJOYMENT by the author."
3,Needs more depth,"I don't really like this opening any more, it's too loose. This book doesn't explain the positions well, and there are a lot of gaps, which is unaccaptable. Most of the games are Hodgeson's. The treatment on the Levitsky Attack (1. d4/d5, 2. Bg5) was nice."
2,Not worth the money,"This has good basic business startup information, but about 1% of it is specific to va,dc and md."
1,Watch this Review,"I have had a problem with my sacro-iliac joint, where the pain permeates into the lower back. I tried the exercises from the book which included using the backblock, for months. It did absolutely nothing for me.Good marketing though."
5,Must read before treatments or surgery,"I've purchased this book and her New Back in Action book as well. Both are very good; these books should be issued by doctors to every sufferer of back pain. Few if any doctors or chiropractors provide a thorough explanation of what causes back pain. Sarah Key's books are among the most thorough and informative sources on the subject. I only wish I had purchased them years ago. Before you have endless treatments let alone surgery, I recommend reading this book to 1) fully understand the mechanics of the back, 2) educate yourself on the causes of back pain and 3) learn some helpful exercises that may help you reduce or eliminate your back pain on your own."
5,A must read if you have back problems,".For 6 months I suffered with sciatic pain in my right leg. Could not sit in a chair at all and spent most of my days lying down on a heating pad and taking lots of pain relief medications. After reading this book, I am able to sit confortably again, but you must do the exercises daily!"
5,Excellent Book!,"I own an older edition of Sarah Key's Back Sufferer's Bible that I've bought some years ago when I first start to had back pain due to a degenerative disc disease and herniated disc. Over the years, trying to avoid a surgery to substitute the bad disc by a protesis, I have tried everything but I always come back to Key's book and advise. This book is worth the investment, it will help you for the rest of your life. I'm so glad I bought it."
2,very small chair,"I ordered this chair thinking it would be a lot larger than it is because the info said for up to age 8. There is no way an 8 year old could fit in this chair. I didn't order the mini saucer chair and thought would be considerably larger. Next time I will pay alot more attention the the actual size. My granddaughter is 3 and it will probably be to small for her. Not a good value for what you get. Maybe she can use it for her babydolls, because by the time I paid for the chair, restocking fee and shipping charges to send it back it's to expensive to send it back. NOT HAPPY at all."
3,Cute,The chair itself is very cute but not one that my two year old can just lean back into as the back is not high enough. The chair also topples over every time she tries to get out of it.
4,Greatness.,A fantastic mix. If you are into house that will make your feet act like they are in a frying pan this is for you!Hot Feet!
4,Sue knows her Ridgebacks!,"Having been owned by a ridgeback for over 7 years, Ms. Fox was right on with her ""complete pet owner's manual."" I especially enjoyed the humor she used when discussing the imperative need for early training. I have always had dogs, but this is my first hound and I will always have a ridgeback. Though definately not a dog for everyone, this book educates the owner or potential owner on the cons and many pros of living with this wonderful breed."
5,Very Helpful,This book was very helpful as i've never owned this breed before. I have a mix dog that is part Rhodesian and part pit mix. I bought this book and an APBT book to help me with my new puppy. It arrived fast and it's a good reading material. Very basic and informative. I highly recommend it.
4,Very general information.,"Dont get me wrong, this book is a great read and I certainly recommend it to anyone who buys/owns a RR. The problem with the book is that when it comes to the training area or any specific breed information, the book is very general. This book is best for a new RR dog owner and a must for someone who has not had a puppy before."
4,Right on,Rhodesian Ridgebacks Manual is pretty much right on with the temperment and traits of this breed. Quick read with helpful tips.
4,Thorough,"This is not intended to be a comprehensive, indepth encyclopedia. BUt as a basic primer on Rhodesian Ridgebacks, it covers all of the key highlights and provides a firm foundation for understanding this wonderful breed.Intelligently written, well-illustrated, well-organized, easy to navigate, with an index and bibliography.I highly recommend it.$8. 95 pp., Good binding and glossy paper."
2,Basic,I was expecting this book to be more informative. More of a coffee-table book in style of information.
2,"Short, generic and too basic","I recently discovered my mut was half rhodesian and decided to study up. I've had labs all my life but knew this breed was different and a bit more finicky so I wanted a book that delved into the personality type of the dog, training tips, behavioral overviews, and maybe had some case studies of what to do and not to do in certain situations. This was not that book. This was dog owning 101. It may as well been about wolves as it addressed the basics of most any dog. In a word, ""duh."""
5,Wonderful,"Ok, I will admit to being pretty omnivorous about reading good Shakespeare scholarship - Greenblatt, Garber, Bloom and reaching back to Mack and Kermode and forward to Rosenbaum and Janet Adelman's fascinating book - but this one is my favorite of them all. It is clear, elegantly argued, beautifully researched, vividly engaging, and entirely persuasive. It does not do as Greenblatt does and pile a supposition on top of a speculation on top of a suspicion and then, later, present them as a factual basis for still more speculation. This is anchored solidly in the what can be documented but uses that material to explore widely. Bloom is hard to surpass for a general and readable overview, but this one goes deeply. Loved it."
3,Scholarly sleeping pill,"I love Shakespeare, so I was most interested in what Shapiro had to say especially since he is focusing on one year, 1599. Only a few years before Elizabeth I death.... The research is stellar, I am sure if you are a student of William, then this is for you, but for the average reader or for someone who just wants to see what Shakespeare is all about, you might be better served in some less scholarly work. Can induce deep sleep if you get this book on the audiobook version with Lew Grenville who typically puts no life into the text at all, but is perfect for straight tellings of bios..."
4,Good camera,It is worth buying for simple uses like for seeing family and friends. I received as a gift. It is very portable and will sit just about anywhere and has a nice focus right on the front.I would recommend it.
1,"Veo Does Not Support Their Own Product, I wont either!!!!!","I purchased a VEO CONNECT... 333V ****DON'T DO IT!!!They have a web site that is all dead links, they have updated software downloads that aren't really there... They will not return email. And the phone # doesn't go through! I am not talking about ""I tried once or twice"" Im talking both I and the seller have gone back to the site almost every day for over a month now. Still no help, no email, and NO SUPPORT! The CD rom bundled software they included with the cam, does not up load... And they will NOT HELP!"
2,Old Webcam,"Pay attention to the dates of the reviews here. This was my first webcam. It's not bad, but do not pay more than $10 for this thing. You have to focus it by hand, by turning a very loose plastic ring around the lens. It has no built-in mic.In fact, the only reason I'm bothering to review this at all is that I noticed it is listed at this time as being $40 plus $10.95 shipping. You could buy 100 other webcams for that price that are MUCH, MUCH better than this thing. If you don't have a webcam already and you manage to find this one very cheap, then go for it. However, any $25 Logitech webcam (in 2009) will be a far better purchase with a lot more bells and whistles than the Veo Connect. I don't think this cam is even still being manufactured."
1,Do not buy this game,Honestly this game is not worth over $50. This game bombed so bad that it was on sale at my local department store for $9.99 only one month after its release.My local video game store refused to even take this game for free.This game tries to similate Zelda and the Ocarina of time with its many time loops. Beware you have to be in a certain time at a certain place in order to advance in the game just like the ocarina of time and to top it off it is not very obvious on what to do.The music gets annoying and is extremely repetitive and so is the enemy fights that come after you in the castle.All in all I am glad I only paid $9.99.The only redeeming quality to this game is the music from the guitar mini game which was played by a very good orchestra but was wasted on this sad sorry of an excuse for a game.
2,What a joke...,"Why is it that every time a new game system comes out (in this case, the mighty PS2), companies flood the market with poor games, sometimes with graphics which would be a letdown on an OLDER machine, sometimes with gameplay that will put a razor to your wrist, and sometimes games that just out and out suck on all fronts?While Ephemeral Fantasia may not be the worst game ever made, it is certainly a disappointment, especially when one considers the fact that it was released by Konami. I tried, I mean, I REALLY tried to get into this game, but it is just horrible. Yeah, the minigames are fun (hey, I gave it 2 stars), but please, PLEASE steer clear of this travesty of an RPG. I want my money back..."
1,One of the worst RPG's I've played,"I tried to like this game, but it has so few redeeming qualities that it is just not worth wasting your time on. It has some originality with the idea of repeating the same week over and over, but this idea is executed very poorly. Most of the time, you just end up waiting around and going through a whole week in the game just to get one little task done. It's boring and frustrating. The battle system is okay. It offers nothing special or unique, but it is adequate, and the graphics (...). Don't buy this game, and even be wary of renting it. No matter how long you play it, it never gets good. Not even close."
2,Could have been so much better,"This game started off quite well. But it has flaws that just detracts from the game so much. A serious lack in the ease of finding the plot. After a while it can be tricky to have any idea what the character is meant to be doing. Alot of rpg's spoon feed the plot. This ones becomes so hidden that you are left wondering what is the point. The graphics are ok, but the repetative use of graphics makes the game not only harder to navigate but also visually dull. It just lacks deapth and interest. Interesting characters like rummy just are not in it enough. There are better rpg's out there and there will be better ones for the PS2 coming."
1,Please heed the warnings,"... this game is horrible. Please, do not be caught up as I was with the promise of a PS2 RPG. This game is difficult to play, boring and many times brings on the ""smack my head with a controller"" syndrome. If you got this game for free, give it five minutes of your time. But never drop a dollar for this, or it will be a dollar wasted... this game is bad. Very bad. And I'm sorry I bought it."
1,... WASTED!!!,"When i bought this game i thought it would have decent sound the reapetive ""Music"" really gave me a headace in the first 5 minutes I've played it!!! If you want this game keep in mind you'll be wasting your money!!! If you want real rpg games buy Final Fantasy games!!!"
1,Oy...,"OK. People, you should seriously save your money and not buy this game--if you want to rent it go ahead, I'm glad I did, because if I had bought it I would have made a BIG mistake. Ugh...to start, the controls are REALLY hard to use, and once you get used to them (if you ever) they make your hand start to hurt. And when you go out of town, every 10 seconds stupid and annoying monsters show up that you can kill in a snap. And the graphics are HORRIBLE!! Waaaaah, the graphics of PS1 are just as good, if not better...and the storyline is rather unorigial...the minigames don't even make sense, there's never anything to do, you always get lost and it takes forever to get around, and...must I go on? So basically, don't buy this game. It's a waste of you money and your time."
1,IF YOU DON'T LIKE HEART ATTACKS AND HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE...,"THIS IS THE WORST GAME I HAVE EVER PLAYED. You (mouse) is stuck in a constant time loop. Most of the game is running around though the town. Almost 0 progress is made after the beginning. Everytime I try to play this is feel my blood pressure going up because THERE IS NOTHING TO DO! Think a huge castle might be fun to explore? wrong! there are annoying monsters readly to ambush about every 15 seconds. That's another thing. This game relies on time. The graphics are horrible. I think my gameboy had better graphics.. seriously. The one major plus of this game is the music. It has one of the best scores i've ever heard on a game. Up there with the final fantasys'. Rent this before you buy it if you have any intrest at all. If you don't like it, try FFX... that's a good game."
3,"Okay game, graphics not PS2 quality","The game has a good theme, however the graphics should be better for a PS2 game. Final Fantasy 8 and 9 have better graphics."
2,Totally Upset,"When I looked at the cover, I was convinced that this is a good game. Indeed, this game delivered a solid RPG gameplay. However, as I compared it to FFX, this game was lacking. It has no characters vocal, no point of destination, and the game repeated for several times.The graphics was not so good, which made me lost my interest in playing this game until the end. The monsters were not as unique as other RPG games.It's really fun to play a musical instrument (a guitar). I get hooked by the mini games. Although it has a variety of songs, it only based on one song. The last song that Mouse should performed to Xelpherpolis was so difficult. The rhytm was so fast.Seriously, this game needed some modifications before it was released to the market. I hoped Konami will remake this game^O^.Please rent this game before you buy it. If you're satisfied, then purchased it later."
5,Cute and Durable,"Put this on my car's antenna and it looks great.It's been some time, and it is still securely in place and looks fine.Much easier to find my car in a crowded parking lot."
3,Go Sox,"Very expensive when factoring shipping and handling but then again, being a SOX fan I just put up with it. It lasted one year until the hat came off (but I suspect it was the nasty doings of a Yankee)."
5,A penetrating view of group thinking,"At last, Seth gets specific about our current events and talks about the distored realities that led up to events like Jonestown and the Watergate affair. His discussion of the dividing line between idealists and fanatics is most fascinating and might make you rethink our nation's military policy. The themes that run through all of his books, that humans are of good intent, and that we create our own reality, are repeated here again, of course, but each book brings a new light to bear on those very basic and important messages. Read this book if you are concerned about, and involved with any kind of group, from your family to an international movement."
1,Tai chi for Seniors,"Very disappointing. Very poor image quality, it looks like a pirate copy and not a very good one! Sound is also very poor quality and the exercises are basically the same four movement viewed from different angles."
3,Tai Chi for Seniors,He is very difficult to understand-it would have been nice if they would have dubbed it in English. His exercises are a little more difficult to do than the other Tai Chi for Seniors I ordered. Will use this one when I get more proficient with the easier tape.
3,It's Ok,"It was cute but dated material, if you lived in New York during Ed's terms as mayor - you saw this across the Daily News. Nice short book with a lot of one-liners."
1,wit and wisdom of Ed Koch?,"If this book were true to its title, it would be the shortest book in the English language.Smallchief"
5,Monique Greenwood has the right thinking formula for how to view life.,I had to read this book a couple of times because I liked it a lot. Monique Greenwood caused me to think about what I really saw for my life and not what others wanted for me. As many people would say at the end of the day you have to live with the decision you made.
3,Bootstrapper I am not,The book was ok. I really couldn't relate the the bootstrapper mentality she talks about throughout the book. I really don't think anyone can do it alone. She also doesn't think that either but I didn't find that out the the last chapter.I also thought she put to much emphasis on makeup.
5,Having What Truly Matters,This book should definitely be in any african-american woman's library along with her bible. Learning to step out of your on way and stop blocking your blessings. Ms. Greenwood helps the reader define what is important to them personally. This book put me on the right track.
5,Great cd.,This cd has some great songs on it. My wife listens to it over and over. Would like to find another cd by Joe Dowell.
3,NO BIG DEAL,JUST GLAD I CAN GET ONE I MADE A MISTAKE BY NOT TIGHTING IT DOWN MY LOSS YOUR GAIN AT LEAST IT SAVED ME TIME BY NOT GOING TO THE JUNK TO GET ONE
3,"Not bad, definitely not great","It's a racing game...my favorite kind. It's why I own a console. However, graphics like this aren't acceptable anymore nowadays. Go license the GT3 engine, and come back with a newer product.The game play is good, and I love the accelerated dusk-to-dawn approach."
4,i like it,I like this game... this game is a 1 of a kind. You have to get into it b for u like it. At first i did not like Le mans but my brother played it and he kinda liked it so we started to race then after 1 or 2 times of playing it i liked it too....But it is not up to me if u like the game or not so i say rent it first.
4,Great Value! Gameplay vs. Graphics... you decide.,"Great Value! Lots of Fun! Even now in 02 this Game is still a lot of fun. The only thing is the graphics.... the are very good but not excellent. Especially behind the wheel looking at the track but then the replay mode is beautiful and to drive into the night is fantastic! Pit stop is better than a lot of other racing games. The Cars feels real and oversteer can make you spin quickly. I can recommend this, it is real fun and good value especially now for a low price. I still love playing it and we have 7-02. Game Hint: For qualifying reduce you fuelload to a minimum ( like in F1 etc ) ."
2,I cook for a living...,"I purchased this knife a year and a half ago on impulse, taken in by it's minimalist design, it is a beautiful concept but I paid RETAIL. It IS beautiful but... after 18 months of everyday use in a commercial kitchen I am selling it (at half price) to a younger sous chef that was taken in by the design. I hope that he can cope with it.This knife is very high maintenance. Once I sliced some cured meat, Genoa Salami I think, plunged the knife into scalding hot, soapy water, rinsed and wiped her down with a clean cotton towel just as I do all of my knives after use. I guess that I didn't wipe hard enough along the cutting edge because after only 10 hours the ""cure"" had eaten three tiny pin point notches in the blade's edge. It's been a downhill relationship ever since. I can't cut this or that, the knife has a balance point too far back for a pro's liking, the edge is sooo delicate that it requires twice the ""steeling"" that my forged knives do ... it's a pain...good ridance."
3,Clymer Mercruiser Shop Manual,This shop manual is very extensive in most of its information and instructions. The illustrations and photographs however leave a lot to be desired. The illustrations or drawings are difficult to follow because all lines are drawn the same and are all in black and white. The photographs all in black and white are difficult to use. Some are fuzzy or too small to be able to see small parts and details. The manual obviously has not been updated recently. In your search for the best shop manual I would recommend buying the one with the most recent updated edition. I purchased a Clymer manual based on reputation and price. It wasn't my best purchase.
4,"Charming, if a little creaky","French director, Jacques Demy, created charming worlds on film that could never really exist. Every film of his I've seen seems absolutely set in the surreal. This film is no exception. While it takes place in modern day (for the time - late 1960s) it has no relationship to any reality I've ever known. Everyone sings constantly and things happen that could not possibly happen but if you go with it, it's a lovely ride. At it's heart, it's the delightful story of two stunningly beautiful sisters (Catherine Deneauve and Francoise Dorleac) and their wish for true love to find them. Add in the unexpected American cast members of George Chakiris and Gene Kelly (of all people!), and you've got a musical unlike any other you have seen. The musical score by Michel Legrand is whimsically seductive and memorable."
2,Comme Ci Comme Ca,"Although I loved the colours and the clothes, and few of the tunes were catchy, overall I felt the film was rather bizarre. Catherine Denevue and her sis would have been better served with flattering wigs. Catherine was also very graceless in her moves, dancing and other. A strange flick, no doubts."
2,In between,"It's too, well, French, to be a traditional musical (a lot more overt sexuality than what you'd expect from a film with Gene Kelly), but it's too much of a wanna-be American musical (that misses the mark) to stand as a good French film. The romantic pairings are laughable as are the supposed talents of the characters. Gene Kelly looks incredibly out of place and awkward. Yes, it has some lovely music, bright colors, and a few charming characters, but overall is very disappointing. The best part of the film is the smooth and understated opening credit sequence highlighting the ferry ride across the river. It's downhill from there. If you like Jacques Demy stick to Lola and the Umbrellas of Charbourg. If you like Gene Kelly stick to An American in Paris and Singin' in the Rain."
2,Weird French Pop Film,"I don't doubt that the other reviewers are sincere in liking this film, but the prospective purchaser should be warned that this is a really weird, hokey, pop movie that is hard not to laugh at. The best thing about it is the discovery that the French could have made something so utterly artificial and commercial. OK the dancing and visuals are pretty, but you have to watch the whole thing with a sense of irony."
2,french cheese- the stinky kind,"What can I say except that I was pleased that Gene Kelly only had to spend 10 minutes in this unfortunate film. As always, I can't really say anything against Gene Kelly but as for the rest of the film? Well, it is a feeble attempt at creating a french version of the Hollywood musical. They really missed the mark but I guess it would of helped if ANY of the stars could sing. If you can imagine, they dubbed Gene Kelly's singing voice.....mon Dieu."
1,What you get IS NOT what is pictured above,"Please beware - you will not get what you see in the picture above. The hair guards you see pictured are not the same ones you will receive. They're significantly wider between the individual blades, flimsy, and contain one-less ""blade"" in them. For those of you who know how to cut hair, you'll realize this means a poorer, less-even look on the hair. You also do NOT get the 1/8th guard as is shown in the picture above. Its simply not included. Someone seriously screwed up."
2,Remington HC-921 Haircut Kit,"I purchaded a set of Wahl clippers about 5 years ago and have been cutting my own hair for that period of time. I thought I would upgrade and get me a new set. I liked the looks of the Remington HC-921 kit. I purchased it and have used it one time. I don't think I will use it again. If the plastic guards were any cheaper and flimsy, they would break. As far as the clippers themselves, they work fine, but I use a guard when I cut my hair. If the guard does not work well, then it really does not matter how the clippers cut. I think I will continue using my 5 year old Wahl clippers that I paid less that $20.00 for until I can get another set like them. Would not purchase this product unless you want a set of clippers that you are not going to use guards with. You will be disappointed if you have used anything else!"
4,Great product.,"I am using it for over a month and a had no problem , work just fine .If you are thinking in to buy this , do it ."
1,don't like it,I did not know that this product would give me hard time. .It dose not cut as my old five dollars one.
2,"It could have been so good, but...","...the blades go dull and can't be replaced. Then you're stuck with the guilt of sending a perfectly good motor and casing to the landfill. Not very environmentally friendly, Remington.I will never again trust a clipper with non-replaceable blades. The low price of this product is just not worth the headache and waste it produces."
5,Better Hair Trimmer,"Used several hair razors and found most to be too weak, and some to be very hard to hold because of poor design. The Remington is excellent in design and function. Quiet, strong and easily maneuvered."
1,RemingtonHC921,Not good. Had to trow away. Excessive vibration that loosened the screws. I had a HC920 and loved it. No comparison.
2,Broken blades,Another user with broken guide blades. Razor works...just checked I have 5 crack or broken blades which renders the razor almost useless. I also have a Wahl that I'm happy with. It also came with a 1/16 guide blade. Good for blending.
3,15 month FAIL,"I bought this HC-921 about 18 months ago. It was GREAT for about fifteen months & used it once a month. Then, suddenly the last time I used it it was not cutting well and pulling alot. Now it doesn't cut at all.The product cover says ""Lube-For-Life TITANIUM coated blades"" but the enclosed brochure says, ""The blades on your HC-70 hair clipper should be oiled before every haircut""??? (I never oiled them.)Whatever - the blades no longer cut!Servicing & sharpening the blades costs more than replacement."
3,Somewhat disappointing clipper,"I've owned the exact same clipper for about 6 years now and it was a workhorse. So when it died on me, I decided to buy the exact same model. All of the old attachments fit the new clipper which may comfort some people but I rarely use the attachments. I mainly use the clippers, with no attachments, to buzz my head. These new clippers have a little less power because you feel the motor start to cutout and they pull the stubbies of my scalp. With the old clipper, I would buzz my head once sometimes twice a week. But since these new clippers tug the stubbies, I now have to buzz it 3 times a week. It does leave a close enough cut where it almost looks you've shaved your head but the tugging will cause ingrown hairs if you let it grow for too long, hence the 3 times a week. Another case of a great product revamped to bologna..."
3,Good,"Having used the cordLESS version for years, I've decided to switch to the CORDED version because recently the cordless versions have been giving me lots of problems. So far this model has been trouble-free for the most part and it's almost a year old now. It gave me some weird noises in the beginning but disappeared. Lately the blades have been seizing for some reason and I have to move the blade around to get it working again."
2,Almost a great product,"After receiving the hair clippers i was very excited to get cutting, i cut my own hair. For the first two hair cuts it was a fantastic product and did the main grooming perfectly, you will need a pair of small trimmers for the edges and beard trimming. After that it started making a knocking noise so loud that i couldnt use it. After cleaning it and removing excess hair, I found that if i jammed a small Q-tip under the back of the blade it would stop the noise but being a new instrument i shouldnt have to do that. Have not tried the hassle of returning it yet.."
1,Waste of money.,"This trimmer is good at yanking your hair out, leaving a nice leopard print haircut. Unless you have microscpic thin hair, don't buy this."
1,Drop In Quality,"I had purchased a Remington Titanium about five years ago and loved it! After dropping these clippers several times over the years and through regular wear-and-tear, however, it was time to get a new unit. Unsurprisingly, I purchased another Titanium.Unfortunately, I was punished for my loyalty.While I can't comment on the supplementary pieces as I don't use them, the unit itself saw more metal components substituted with plastic; the cord length was halved; and the motor appeared weaker or blades were/went dull (stalls frequently when cutting my hair.) Forget salon quality ... these clippers are not even suited for casual home use.I'm sure the executives behind these 'quality' choices are enjoying their bonuses. I, on the other hand, am disappointed with their product and will avoid buying a Remington -- of any sort - in the future."
1,haircut kit,the box the product came in is the best feature of this item.on first haircut my wife was pulling the hair out by the roots to cut the hair. we stopped using this new product & finished w the old shears. i am sending this back & buying another costing three times the money & figure my scalp is worth it.
5,Great Hair Cutting Kit,"The negative reviews are non-sense. I have thick hair and it has worked perfectly for over 5 years now. Unless you abuse it, it will work for many years for almost all hair types."
1,Lasted less than two months,I had a prior Remington hair clipper that was the cordless version of this model and it lasted FIVE YEARS. This one has lasted less than two months before succumbing to a horrible deafening clatter. It was quiet for the first month and then the clatter slowly emerged. The clippers are now unusable. Terrible drop in quality from the last one I owned.
4,Not bad at all for the price!,"I thought this webcam is definitely worth every penny. It is inexpensive and does the trick. If you are looking for something more hi-tech, then this may not be what you want, however, you looking for something simple to do simple little messages, or use on MSN Messenger...you got it all here! I'm very pleased with my purchase and would definitely recommend it. I'm actually purchasing another to send up to my mother in Canada for Christmas!"
3,Webcam with less oomph,It was very inexpensive but the quality is not all that great. If you just need something to use to communicate with someone online it works but no video capabilities and it doesn't take pictures.
4,Really shouldnt complain,"For the price there is nothing to complain about. But i did have problems getting it to work correctly on WinXP. The software it was shipped with did not work, then i had to DL the latest version of the software. From there snapshots would not work, so i had to go back to the website and follow a troubleshooting tip on how to fix it. Now it seems to work correctly. Through all of this it did work flawlessly with Yahoo messenger though."
1,Very Bad Cam,"If you're thinking about buying this cam don't, it's not worth the trouble. I bought this cam from amazon two days, and I'm having a lot trouble with my computer. Installing this cam is very hard, and when I did install it, my computer stop working. The price was too good to be true, they had to be something wrong with it. This cam doesn't work. You should not buy this cam."
4,Excellent in many ways,"Graves uses the traditional method of breaking the face down into its components. He provides illustrations of how to draw each feature from frontal, half profile, and profile views. He is particularly good on the mouth and lips (seven pages are devoted to the subject), with the lips under the influence of varying emotions. His discussion of the hands (17 pages) is detailed and will teach more than I have so far had the time to absorb. His fewer pages on the ear and eyes are also good. The brief sections on composition are good, although I wish they were longer. Not so good on hair. All in all, I would recommend it to the serious student. I don't think any single book could teach all you may want to know, but this book will certainly add to your knowledge."
5,classic sound,"If you enjoy the ABC label music of Ray Charles, then you will enjoy this CD. All those hits are on it. As has been explained in other reviews, the sound quality is superb. The recordings were done properly to begin with, and the mastering for this particular set is superb. For a person who is simply looking for Ray's biggest 60's recordings, this cd is all you need."
2,women of the forest,"Hated it. Nice example of looking at the world through your own colorful, subjective lenses. Had to read this for a sociology class and everything in there was male = bad, female = good. And this book was just used to help prop up those theories."
3,train engine,The item arrived in timely manner. Package was in good shape. Unable to get engine to smoke. Have ran engine for several hours and used small amout of solution with no avail to getting to smoke. Very disappointing.
1,Lauren is still missing,"Still missing in action. Placed the order 5/15/07 and yet to receive, its now 5/26. Apparently post office is at fault."
4,Excellent CCNP resource,"I ordered these 4 books because i was going for my CCNP, however after a little while (during a 2 month period) CCNP got upgraded to a newer version, still not to be disappointed i read both sets of CCNP, old one and the new one. Took the 4 new exams, passed them all, extremely happy with the results! In my opinion old CCNP books are valuable and a lot of help because the CIT and BCRAN books/exams are not in the new CCNP course and also some things of old BCMSN (like SPAN) just got removed and it's a shame really.. What happens if an employer asks you about SPAN and you know nothing about it because the new BCMSN course does not cover it? Uh oh.. That's right! Better be prepared."
3,Up-to-date information but with a lot of typos,"I bought the CCNP Certification Library for recertifying my CCNP and CCDP. I have just finished reading the BSCI book. Although the book has some up-to-date information such as IS-IS, there are a lot of typing errors which I hope Cisco Press will fix in the second edition."
3,Wasn't Impressed...,"I just got back from Argentina, Chile, and Uruguay and was not overly impressed with Frommer's Guide. While it generally pointed us in the right direction, I encountered a number of inaccuracies, and the book was WAY off on prices (while I understand the currency has moved, the book is significantly off on a comparable basis). I would also be interested to know what kind of age group this book targets..."
3,Not a great help for cheap travel,Frommer's covers well information about expensive hotels and restaurants. It is not very helpful if you are looking for cheap travel lodging and meals.
3,Need Price Updates,"It is a good book with useful information to plan the trip. However, double check prices published in this book (need update) when you are in Argentina or Chile."
4,"Comprehensive, sympathetic, authoritative.","This is the book that helped resurrect the reputation of one of the most tragic figures in English literature. When this book was originally published, Wilde was nowhere near the iconic figure he is now accepted as. Dying in poverty and disgrace in 1900 in Paris, (where all ""bad"" Englishmen went in the 19th century!) Wilde was still anathema to the ""Establishment"" for close to a half century afterward. Today, a bust stands in Westminster Abbey, and Hesketh Pearson's biography can claim a good measure of the credit for it.Comprehensive, detailed and sympathetic without being hagiographic, this book is essential to understanding the enigmatic genius of Oscar Wilde."
1,incorrect information in ad,"I can""t rate this item because the two boxes of staples which were supposed to be included were not.I thought I was ordering an item which could be used right out of the box."
5,Confucius with the best commentary and translation.,"The only problem is that the text may be hard to follow smoothly since small amounts of translation are possible on each second page due to the commentary and original characters.But the translation is the best, and the commentary is superb.I highly recommend it!"
4,"Excellent, High Energy praise and worship",I was lucky enough to see planetshakers live at the planetshakers conference 2005 in Australia. Totally amazing new generation praise and worship! This CD is just a taste of that spirit and is definitely a must have!
4,My first book review..,"My name is Steven Rodriguez and I have read the book called Arthur and the New Kid, I really think this book is a good book for kids to read because this really happens in the real world people judge people for their looks before even getting to know how they are. So i think kids should read books like this beacuse it can show them to not judge people from there looks."
1,Not what I expect from Marc Brown or Arthur books,Very disappointed. We have many Arthur books and have watched the PBS show over and over and over.... But this is not up to the standards of Marc Brown or the Arthur we know and love.
5,Great stuff,"Great stuff by one of Jazzdom's most under- appreciated clarinetists. Worth the price for the marvelous trumpet work of Joe Thomas and Bobby Hackett alone. For modernists, one of the first ""older"" players to dig , and hire, the younger progressive musicians, including Buddy Rich and Shelley Manne. A wonderful recording."
2,brikka coffee maker poor,"We bought the bialetti brikka after we were told it would make great coffee with the crema on top .It doesnt , we have tried evrery thing , very poor results, and we have used these machines many times before. Want good coffe that makes crema on top from the coofee itself , buy the caffitalia from Woolworths , easy to clean , easy to use and fair price"
2,Disappointing--so far...,"Well I got a 2cup moka express and I loved it! Then I heard that the Brikka would make an even BETTER brew! So I bought the 4cup Brikka. Here are my observations:the 4cup brikka makes only a little bit more than my 2cup Moka express.the brikka leaks out between the bottom and top pieces of the pot before producing any coffee so I have to lift the valve myself to let the coffee come out the top to prevent further leakage. When I do that, I find that there still is about 1/4th of the water in the bottom chamber!Basically: my brikka leaks too much no matter what I do to prevent it.Stick with what has worked for the last 90 years, stick with the moka express."
1,I. Hate. This. (But I love Bialetti.),"I joyfully used a Bialetti 2-cup for 15 years. No problem. I thought I was upgrading when I purchased the Brikka. But, consistently, only 1/2 the water brews. Also, it is virtually impossible to unscrew. If I tighten too much, it takes DAYS for me to unscrew it. If I don't tighten, the coffee leaks out of the center. I did everything recommended, from making startup brews, using the expensive Moka Illy coffee. To no avail. This coffeemaker hates me. And I hate it.UPDATE: What I learned from this experience is that BIALETTI IS WONDERFUL. They generously gave me a new (different) coffee maker and coffee tin. Great customer service earns my loyalty. Grazie, Bialetti!"
5,Great coffee maker,"Really works well...not really espresso, but works well, this used along with the Bialetti Moka Express makes a nice addition to my coffee bar..."
1,Didn't work for me...,"We use this type (same shape and material) of coffee maker for years with excellent results. But, this unit made the worst coffee ever. We followed all directions and used various types of coffee grinds and it made a bitter undrinkable coffee every time. We sent it back to Amazon for a refund and order another brand to try."
5,I'm glad I get it!,"I used stovetop for a while, and bought another Bialetti once. It is true that only Bialetti ""Brikka"" can produce that ""crema."" I'm amazed by how good my espresso tastes and how easy it is (read the instruction carefully once and you'll make good coffee forever.) I read other reviews that 2-cups might not be enough, but I think 4-cups is too big for one cup drinker. I wish I had got a 2-cup, cuter and easier to store. It is still a fantastic buy!"
3,nice but not perfect,"It's true that it does make crema. But you need to pour the coffee w/in 5 seconds of it percolating or else the crema quickly disappears. Also the handle is cheap. The first unit delivered arrived w/a broken handle. The one they resent has been working well, but you can tell the handle is cheap; I suspect that it too will break in a few months if I continue using this daily."
5,Review of the 2 Cup model,"I am very picky when it comes to espresso... and I have been very surprised by the good quality espresso this machine is capable of! The 2-cup model is preferable - especially if you only intend to serve 1-3 cups at a time. You need to make the whole amount, so it ends up being wasteful if you buy the 4-cup version (if only 1-2 people are served). Americans are accustomed to ""double espresso"" size servings - if you make single espresso size shots a 2-cup model can easily produce 3 generous portions.I have found the Brikka espresso tastier than the Moka. And if prepared correctly, there really is a decent crema on top. There's no comparing homemade to professionally made espresso - but this little brikka is better than most home machines that cost hundreds of dollars. I highly recommend!"
4,"Maybe not espresso, exactly, but very good","OK, it's not espresso ""per se"" (to use the older Italian), but it's very good coffee and fun to make. I find that I get different amounts of crema from different beans. My local coffee, Equal Exchange, gets nice and creamy with Brikka, but some others are just ""flat"". Overall, this is a great pot."
1,Not worth the effort,"This is either the fussiest coffee maker in the universe, or I'm the stupidest person who has ever tried to make coffee with it. No matter what coffee I use, what temperature I use, how much or how little water or coffee I use, when I take it off the stove, etc., any ""crema"" that might briefly appear either gets blasted away by the pressure-induced spurts of steam that come from the stem of the coffee maker once the coffee has brewed, or gets boiled off because the maker has no way to stop heating itself. Plus, every pot of coffee I have made (20+ and still trying) has tasted terrible - burnt and bitter. Yuck."
4,Good Food,"I have two schnauzers, which are known for their dry skin issues. I was worried they wouldn't like it, since they've been on the same food (pedigree) their whole lives. They LOVE it. On the back of the bag, it suggests adding a bit of water, to make it more flavorful. I did that, and they won't eat it any other way.Their dry skin is now gone, and their hair is much shinier and softer. Amazing what a truly good dog food will do for a dog.I only gave it 4 stars, because it is so expensive. I go thru a 20 lb bag a month, and it's usually around 35-$40. But, it is good."
3,Most rise ***1/2stars,"Inara George makes pop music, albeit pop music with twisty, inventive melodies and interesting song structures. All Rise is Inara's debut and though she's in fine voice throughout, some things work better on it than others.'Fools Work' for instance, never really gets off the ground and whether by accident or design 'Turn On/Off' is much more turn-off than on. The lovely, dreamy 'No Poem' and 'What A Number' however, are the musical equivalent of being swept off your feet by a gentle wind and transported to a more beautiful place. Other tracks that have this bouyant, uplifting quality are 'Good To Me' and 'A Day' in which she duets with her godfather Jackson Browne.The glimpses of brilliance on 'No Poem' and 'What A Number' in particular, suggest that Inara George has the necessary talent to be able to pull off a real masterpiece. All Rise is a decent effort and well worth investigating but this is not her masterpiece - Inara's best is yet to come."
4,Keep your eye and your ear on it,"this is possibly the most interesting and pleasant album i've heard in the past year. beyond the obviously good singing i was taken by the production and the songs... they are familiar but a little bit ambiguous, which is what i like about the best dylan or beatles or any ""good words"" artists. the music itself is just extremely well done... i don't know why it's so unique or how to categorize it... it's mellow, but not neccessarily slow, dreamlike and electronic but earthbound. whatever... it's just very very cool.well i am giving it 4 stars and not 5 because i feel if ms. george can continue to pursue her art as she has been, even better things can come, and i would like to save the extra star for the future!"
1,"No Info,how do you expect anyone to buy them?","I rate this a 1 star simply because there is NO info on the set. What size are the rims 16""-20""-24""-26""!?!?!?? What are they made of?What Diameter axle would I need? Seems like a good price for the set,but I would not buy them just because there is NO info available!"
4,Great read for married or engaged couples,"My wife and I read this book before we got married. It explains how to use Christian principals to relate to marital issues. How to always approach your mate in charity and always resolve situations in the spirit of love and not anger. It gives accounts of how this philosophy has played a role in many marraiges.While this book is good,we enjoyed Dr. Chapman's other book, The Five Love Languages much better."
2,Acceptable as a basic reference,"This book is readable and offers useful information. It is not balanced in its presentation of important issues, though. Hormone therapy is recommended so frequently that the reader begins to wonder who paid to have the book published."
4,Lotto game,I used this game with higher functioning developmentally disabled adults who seem to like playing the game a lot. WE talk about what use each picture has etc. Leads to good conversations about house hold products
3,Book review,This book was suggested by a friend. It was rather interesting and certainly gave a lot of history of the Apalachia people.
2,Sizing is way off,"The jeans are more or less fine. But overall, their sizing is very inconsistent with other jeans companies. I don't have hours to figure out what my ""right size"" Levis would be, so I won't bother ordering another pair."
4,i like it,"I like these jeans, they are very comfortable. But they were too small for my grow, but it's my fault because I did not pay attention to the name of the product - ""... Petite ...""."
4,Doubtful at first but happy!,"I'm at the stage in life where I cant exactly shop in the juniors section, and to hell with wearing low rise... the worst invention for my body ever!I love the stretchy part in the legs and the slight high waste.First pants that I didn't have to take in the bottoms! Hem freee!Im going to order another pair!"
1,Don't pay any attention to intellectuals anyway,"Nigel Rodgers? I thought it was written by Paul Johnson!Why isn't Jesus in this book? That's George Bush's favorite philosopher! Hey, and for that matter, why isn't George Bush? What he thinks matters a whole lot more than what any of THESE characters thought. Including Jesus. For better or worse. AND, now that I think of it, why isn't Winona Ryder in here? Or anybody else who has some real influence on the world. Don't you think we'd live in a better world, if more people, and more important people, had paid attention to Betrand Russell, rather than Winona? Or George Bush? But they didn't, and these guys were scorned, so why do we have to hear about how bad(ly) they behaved?Write a book about how bad(ly) the NON-philosophers behave! Then DO something about it."
4,L.A. Landmarks of a New Generation,This was a fabulous project spearheaded by the Getty Foundation and chronicled in this book through both text and photographs.
1,Lame,"Someone handed this off to me in the shop and it is certifiably pretty lame. Cartoony, hardly tattoo-looking (shading anyone?) and just plain goofy. Never even looked at the CD, as the book was proof enough that it was dumb.I SUPPOSE one could redraw the ideas into something viable and cool, or you could just find the original Jerry pieces from which these were homogenized from.WEAK. Save your money."
3,Mindlessly Bloody,"The title may sound like a negative, but that is not how I mean it. Brunner is single-minded in his focus. He wants money, and will do what it takes to get paid. He doesn't fight fair. He doesn't pretend to care. He goes in, kills his target, and leaves.And that is perfectly fine. There is nothing wrong with a character who is so focused. In fact, it is a nice change from the ""rogue with a heart of gold"" stereotype. Even when you think Brunner is going to do something nice, events shift and he continues to act only in his own self-interest.I gave the book 3 stars instead of 4 only because it did not completely hold my attention. It is well-written and I did finish it. But it is the kind of book that you can put down for a few days without feeling like you are missing something."
2,Unsatisfactory,"I very much like the movies of Samuel Fuller, but he is far better a film director than he is a writer.The most interesting part of the book is the narration of his life as a journalist. He seems to me to be repetitive and to have a somewhat limited vocabulary. A real disappointment."
4,"works great,flawed design","the antenna works great, kit works perfect, except...the stupid antenna has holes for the screws that are tiny, I am mounting this thing outside into brick, longer screws are too big to fit into the antenna and the smaller screws are too small to drill into brick. Still searching for a remedy, right now its jury rigged-but wont last the winter."
4,sirius dhome kit,this product was half the price of others and was exactly the same not a knock off. it was easy to install and was playing in minutes
4,Home Sirius,This was a awesome purchase for me. It will give you the chance to enjoy siruis xm radio in your home. I think it is so easy to install with your home receiver. They may be one thing that might stump you a little that is placing your antenna for satelitte feed.
3,Sirius,"The Sirius product works great. However, I did have to buy a separate cable to plug into my speaker system. The cables that come with the product do not fit a standard head phone jack so you are required to purchase one that will actually work. Once you find the cable, the product works great!"
4,Good product,I bought this for my husband for father's day and he like it. He likes having it hooked up listening to it while watching the race on tv. It wasn't that hard for him to install inside the house but the only down side is we have to remmeber to take the radio back to the truck when we go somewhere so we can have it to listen to whlie driving. Otherwise we like it alot.
5,Works...!,"Just opened the box on this refurbished unit. I plugged in the power cord, antenna, amp connection, and Starmate 5, and I'm up and running just like that. I set the antenna on the window sill pointing generally southeast (since my window faces east). I have 1-2 bars but one bar is enough. I also purchased the magnetic antenna so I can use this unit in my truck on long trips (I have to steal it from my wife's car of course). I would have mounted the antenna outside if required but it works through the window just fine."
4,Great way to leverage Sirius outside your car,I got this kit to allow me to use enjoy the same music selection I currently enjoy in my car at home. It came with everything I need.
1,Did not work,The home kit did not work. It would not power up the radio. I should have been suspicious when it arrived in plastic bags and not prepackaged as in the picture.
4,Sirius Home Kit,The home kit for the Sirius Stratus 4 radio reciever works as advetised. I mounted it on the antenna on the deck of my condo. It picks up the satellite signal without static even with the location not perfect for our area.
3,FM transmitter,This unit does a decent job of transmitting my satellite radio transmission to most of my home.
3,Ehhh....,Was supposed to function with the similar styled XM radio according to Sirius/XMs website....for the money good deal for the functionality not compatible with certain XM receivers...but I got all the needed hardware to make my existing car cradle work like new!
2,Defective,This item was recieved with a defective connection to the electrical adapter.At first I thought it was the radio but discovered that the radio worked fine.Amazon is amazing at handling returned and I ordered a different home kit.
4,Makes a lot of sense,I enjoyed The Disposable Male. It explores how our biological predispositions play themselves out in our everyday preferences and preoccupations. Gilbert's analysis makes a lot of sense and adds up to a helpful filter for interpreting our everyday lives in terms of a much bigger picture. My one complaint is that I would've preferred to get the documentation as part of the book itself rather than having to go to a web site for it.
2,It's as if James Dobson wrote an evolutionary book,"Stick with Daniel Dennett, this book, is nothing more than conjecture. Look I love evolutionary theory, I see nothing but beauty coming from an appreciation of human life and origins. But when a writer is insistent upon using research that is politically motivated-not by science-than that person has a problem.It is evident that, Gilbert, is still bitter about his divorce, and this shown in his view on women. It would have done his book a great service and he researched Leonard Shlains work on women in the evolutionary time scale, instead of reading what researchers from the American Enterprise Insitute have to say on the matter-remember, AEI, are the folks partly responsible for our military adventure in Iraq-So don't waste your money on this book, I have a copy that you might find outside in a dumpster if you are ever down in San Diego"
5,Superbly written evo-psych primer...,"This book is fast, smart, superbly written, and a real taste treat for those of us readers who crave content cooked in wit, intelligence, and high style. Read it more than once, and discover profundity at the margins."
1,Believe the Title,"About as improbable a story as I've ever picked up. Fiona comes from a Scottish castle, but runs a high tone secretarial service in the city. But takes on the difficult client personally when three previous assistants fail to cut it. She charms, she works instinctively with nary an error. And it gets worse. All the men are gorgeous, including the Greek God ex-husband, the Oklahoma oil baron boss (Redford look alike) and his unlikely business partner, a 6'4"" ""heroicially handsome ... pale copper Apollo."" Then we move on to the bodice ripping, complicated misunderstandings, and so on. Ad naseum.One of the silliest things I've chanced upon."
2,Cut beyond recognition,"Originally saw this film by it's release title: ""Tarzoon: Shame of the Jungle"" and the cuts and edits required to remove the lead characters name in addition to the cuts made to make this have a R rating render this a slim shadow of the originally funny (albeit tasteless)animated comedy. This pale version of the original is basically worthless and difficult (if not impossible) to follow."
2,Cut,This is a cut version of the original. Still funny and entirely cleaned up. If your looking for the original uncut version dont buy this one. If you liked it the first time but dont want the raunchy stuff its okay.
3,meets my need,"I use the homesight system along with D-LINK Internet Cameras to provide my security needs. I've read about the scenario where if one of the Homesight cams is recording, others won't be able to record, so to get around this, I really do not rely on the Homesight to do video at all - intead, I prefer it to handle the initial alerts of entry breaches and send me JPGEG photos. I have my DLINK IP cameras setup to record video to my pc if they detect motion. I can also access the DLINK cams via the internet in responce to the Homesight alerts I get. Although its not perfectly integrated (it would be nice if I could get the DLINK system to integrate with Homesight), this 2 system approach works for me. Both systems have their strong and week points - I'm merely exploiting the strong points of both. Perhaps cludgy, but it works."
1,absolute and complete garbage!,"Do NOT waste your money on this trash!!! Words cannot even begin to describe my frustration with this product, and with Motorola's technical support for this either. I've installed multi-thousand dollar security systems with no real problems before, but this cheap piece of trash is nothing other than that - trash."
4,Decent,I got it for my son; he thought it was a good resource; it contained a good amount of information that he's interested in
2,Ehhh,I do not like the book. The author rambles and makes the book very personal. The book could be better. The sections are not very clear. The book is very redundant.
5,Geography is so much more than maps,"If one sentence were to describe De Blij's ""Why Geography Matters"" it would be that geography is so much more than maps. Yes, maps play a pivotal role in geography. Required reading for my geography class, and it is one of the few books I really enjoyed reading for close.No spoilers in this review :)If you a map person check outCartographia: Mapping Civilizationsit goes well this this book."
5,Handy Reference Work,"""...a handsomely produced volume which will make a handy reference work for paleoanthropologists studying fossil cranial morphology."" (American Journal of Human Biology, Vol. 15, No. 5, September/October 2003)"
2,Does not work on the Ipod Touch 3G,"Put simply, this charger was not compatible for my Ipod Touch 3rd generation. So thats why I am giving it only 2 stars. On the other hand ShopCell, the vendor selling the item, has excellent customer service as they replied to my message promptly which allowed me to return the item and get my money back quickly with no problems."
4,great customer service,"great service, shipped the product right away, and even though one of the blocks were defective, they shipped a replacement right away as well.thanks for great service."
1,Not Durable At All,"This is a very handy item to have, a wall charger for an ipod (or similar device). Unfortunately I have owned two now and each one died after a couple of months of routine use. The workmanship is not very good at all. I have to end up using my usb port / ipod connector (not made by Griffin) to charge using my computer which is not a practical work solution, a cable which I have not had any problems with. Buy another product. You will not get your money's worth with this product."
1,sabatier knivesSabatier Elite 12-Piece High Carbon Stainless,Low Quality CHINA knivesThis company may be a 150 year old French Companybut this is JUNK..Handles on 50% of the knives are not in center.On one large knife the handle is a 1/4 inch thicker on one side that the other :(POOR CRAFTMANSHIP and QUALIT CONTROL
3,"...not lion sabatier, but solid","Use some common sense when considering purchasing these knives. Be aware that a 12-piece knife set at this price point is not going to be flawless. But aside from some aesthetic flaws, these knives are very solid. If you have a sharpening stone around the house this is a nice set that will last. These are intended for the less than obsessed chef, so keep that in mind... If you want perfect french cutlery, buy the Lion Sabatier line, and fork over the cash. If you want some solid, comfortable knives that won't match your car payment... give these a try."
1,Cheap China Junk!,This may be worth the price but is no where the bargian you think you are getting..Sabatier writes there name very lage on there kniveson these they write it so small you can barely see it..Must be they don't want to claim them as theirs..
5,Sabatier Elite Good Value,"This is a great set of knives. They weight distribution is great and they are thick heavy knives. If you are looking for a well made set of knives at a good value, you have found them!"
2,Not fine knives but ok for daily use,"Considering the price these knives are ok. The should hold an edge well. The block is maple, I think, and utilitarian. It wasn't seemless. The handles on the knives were not quite even on each side but they were well fit to the tang. Overall ok knives but a good example of you get what you pay for."
2,You get what you pay for...,"After reading up on what great knives Sabatier made, I was ecstatic to find this set so cheap. I bought it over [online store] (brand new) and upon opening the box, I found that the wooden block was poorly assembled. It was not aligned and you could see the leftover glue residue on the block. The are also decieving, saying that you get 12 items. I thought that meant 12 knives, turned out to be 11 knives and 1 block. On the wooden block however, there are 12 slots for 12 knives/scissors, not 11. The handles are ok, not the most comfortable, I grew up with Cutco knives (which are really sharp and have the most comfortable handles ever but with a hefty pricetag: 800). The Sabatier knives are pretty sharp compared to the cheap store knives. After using this set for the past few months, the best thing I got out of it were the shears. They are very sharp and can cut almost through anything. I think next set of knives I purchase will be from Henkels."
3,Not bad but not the real thing,"Opened the box and was underwhelmed. If you've ever had good knives, don't buy these. I know, you get what you pay for and these are cheap. I feel that Sabatier, who make excellent knives, have sold out their name on the lower end product.They're made in China, and some good products come from there. That in mind, I give this product 3 stars - not bad for china, not bad for the money. Would I buy again, probably not but hopefully time will make the heart grow fonder but I doubt it."
4,'commentary' on her stories,"this book brings one closer to the stories of Flannery O'Connor. Or the other way around. But more than that it helps you to how to read short stories,... and novels."
5,"Insightful, helpful, uplifting: Must Read","As a Christian writer, I found Mystery and Manners uplifting and freeing. Often times Christian's are told, and expected, to limit themselves in their fiction in the name of piety. O'Connor gives good grounds why we should not limit our fiction, and why limiting it is false. She also gives great advice on how to be a better writer. This is a must read from any writer of fiction, Christian minded or otherwise."
4,Pea chickens,"Before reading this book, I never thought about the grandeur of peacocks and pea chickens this way. As a matter of fact, I do not believe I had ever thought about the royal pea chicken. Most of this book is really entertaining, although some is a little heavy-handed. If you are at all interested in the thought process of Flannery O'Connor, read this book"
4,Mind you manners and thank O'Connor for this wonderful insight into her works,"For anyone who is intrigued by O'Connor, this a great compilation of essays written by O'Connor that discuss her style, background, and intentions. This is obviously not as entertaining as her novels or stories, but it's great insight and especially helps in understanding her themes."
5,A thoughtful exploration of the mystery of writing.,This book is an inspiring and entertaining experience for both writers and readers of fiction. Even the more specific essays touch on general issues such as characterization and the underlying meaning in short stories. Fans of Anne Lamott's BIRD BY BIRD and Henry James's and John Gardner's books on writing will appreciate this collection of essays.
2,Cheap? Yes!!!,"Paid about 40 dollars for this. I guess you get what you paid for. seat reclines but not all the way which is OK for my three month old. It is very light which is always a plus. Seat is very uncomfortable very thin, very small for my three month old and supported with what appears like cardboard inside the seat. Wheels are made of plastic. The trays are very tricky and not easy to install should snap in instead of forcing it to fit. The tray in the front for the baby did not fit at all so I can't even use that feature. I Should have paid a little more for a stroller that would be more comfortable for my little one and safer.Folds with one hand which is great but collapsed on me once when it was open. Not sure why."
5,Great for the price!,Definitely for older babies/toddlers. The drink holders on the front and back are wonderful.
4,Excellent Knife - USA Made,"I'm pleased with this knife, it was made in the USA, the quality is very good, the only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 was the scabbard. It's not that it was poor quality, I just personally didn't like the design. Otherwise, it's a 5 star knife!"
5,Great knife,When I first got this knife I didn't realize how big the knife was. The blades about 8in long. The handle is pretty grippy but it's unbalenced blade to knife ratio. Blade wasn't sharpened on the top or bottom but that way you can do it yourself. Otherwise it's a great deal on a great knife
2,"the saying is true, ""you get what you pay for""","I own this camera, and have since then purchased a new one.. before I knew more about cameras, I thought, hey, it's cheaper.. why not?The picture is blurry, and it was a pain to install ( I have windows XP)It has frozen on me several times, and sometimes not even worked (the cam)I recommend paying a bit more and getting something thats gonna work better."
4,Solid Discipleship Material,"Robert C. Beasley's ""The Commandments of Christ"" is an excellent study for those wishing to more deeply understand Jesus' words ""If you love Me, you will keep my commands."" The study collects the imperative sayings of Jesus and organizes them thematically. Jesus' call to service, thanksgiving, and humility as well as his admonitions against fear, worry, and revenge lift the heart and mind.Beasley's treatment is historical, his questions are thought-provoking and his insights are wise. A welcome tonic to the usual more simple bible studies."
4,A good resource for discipleship and discussion,"If you are looking for a thorough treatment of the commands of Christ this is not the book for you. Basically, the author takes the position that since Jesus is God, then all the commands in the Bible are his. So, for the purist who might want a treatment of just the imperatives given by Jesus Christ in the Gospels and first chapter of Acts, the book falls short. Most of the ""commands"" cited are in the apostolic letters of Paul. There are, however, good discussion questions and application sections. Both groups and individuals could use this for personal study over a 13 week period. The author's discussion on the Law and grace is stimulating, and he does a good job of explaining why it is important for Christians to follow the commands of Christ. His application section concerning the Ten Commandments is the strongest aspect of the work and worth the price of the book."
1,Flimsy,Wasn't expecting it to be all plastic shell. Simply a very light weight product with a galvanized steel bucket inside the plastic shell. The product was even warped when received due to the plastic being re-shaped from heat exposure. Not worth the price paid.
4,SMokers Outpost,"Received on time. Much smaller than I expected my fault for not reading the size, but does the job as it is supposed to do!"
3,Where to put your butts,Nice to have for smokers...No smoking in the house..It is a bit to light-weight. It gets the job done.
4,Roomy and Solid,"I was surprised by just how much room this stand offered over my similar size Lovan piece. It is extremely solid and a breeze to put together. I have it loaded with >200lbs and it is perfectly stable. For the money, this can't be beat. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is due to a small nick in a corner of one of the shelves. I don't know if it happened at the factory or during shipment, but I had to use a black marker to fill in the color. I also had one socket screw that was missing the socket. Still managed to get it in, but it was less than ideal. Overall, no biggie for the money spent."
3,just good,"this tv stand does what it suppose to do, hold a lcd tv. nothing out of this world when it comes to luxury. to put together does not take much and can be easily asamble in less than 15 minutes. as far as price goes; just like any other tv stand, expensive/over price!"
4,Sanus is a good brand name w/ good products,"But, watch the vendors carefully... I bought this product for a low price eigthy something and had to pay almost the same price for shipping and handling eighty something plus seventy something = no savingHowever, I have a hundred and twenty five pounds lcd on it now. I'm not moving it.read and study the vendors. product is cool."
5,Excellent product for the price,"This is a sturdy, well-made TV/AV stand; easy to assemble; beautifully crafted (the underside of the shelves has almost as good a finish as the top); with plenty of room for all the video and audio peripherals needed for a good home theatre. It's not all that heavy, either; one person can move it fairly easily after it's assembled, a plus if you don't always have some extra brawn hanging around. I was particularly pleased with the middle shelf, as the absence of the center supports made it the perfect place for my sound bar and also made it easier to get it situated.All in all, a great product, more than worth the price. I highly recommend it."
2,"Good singers, but not good Lakota speakers","The songs on this CD are sung by some really good singers. Unfortunately they don't seem to be very good Lakota speakers. A lot of the words in the lyrics are mispronounced and the lyrics are quite muddled at places. For learning the songs it would also help if the lyrics were written using the standard Lakota spelling as it is used in theNew Lakota Dictionary. Other than that these are really good singers, they just need to learn Lakota better."
4,A fine adventure for new characters,"First of all, let me say that this is not a book. This is a packaged adventure, it comes in a shrink-wrapped cardboard box, and itself contains numerous booklets and maps. There. Having said that...The Accursed Tower is a good Advanced Dungeons and Dragons adventure set in the fantasy world of Faerun, where the Forgotten Realms setting is placed. This is a classic fantasy world in the best tradition of Tolkien. I won't spoil the fun for you by telling what the adventure is about, but it does a very good job at showing your players the basics of the campaign world. The terrain maps are wonderfully understandable, and even the cave maps detailing 3D areas can be read without too much strain. The adventure is easy to build upon, which cannot be said about a great many others. Try it."
3,"A Land Far, Far Away","If your friends know of the Forgotten Realms, they will enjoy meeting up with the famed Drizzt, the dark elven ranger. The story is great, and that should be expected from an author like R.A., but the quest is not difficult. The main problem I ran into was how to get my adventuring group to Iceland Dale, so I'm sure this book is really at its best if your adventurers start out there."
4,A good solid start-up quest for new players.,"This adventure includes plenty of overland an dungeon delving. Also it is easy to expand upon, particulary the underground sections. Some nasty tricks to it, but a well rounded group should have no problem finishing it. Only drawback is the text descriptions of room size and the map don't mesh. Also the placement of stairs on the maps and direction they go can get a little confusing. I recommend this adventure to a novice group or a group of old players starting off with low level characters."
1,The PlayStation3 SUCKS!!!!,"My PlayStation 3 died, I tried to use this to recover my family videos from the internal HDD. The device was able to communicate with my PC but didn't allow me to extract the data. I recommend using a converter that allows you to connect directly to the IDE port.Good luck, E!"
4,Lucid advice,"Exactly as the title says, this book gives the Rosicrucian (via the AMORC organisation) viewpoint on business, goal-seeking and general conduct. While not delving into the private Rosicrucian teachings, author Lewis shares his knowledge of what works and what doesn't, offering many practical tips and examples to members and nonmembers alike. The discussions of affirmations and asking-in-prayer are eye-openers."
1,Do not buy this book,"I don't normally write reviews of books on Amazon, but felt I have to in this case. I just don't want people to be gauged by this guy. I have to give one star apparently because you cannot give zero. Wine investing is a hobby and a passion for me; I've been doing it for twenty years. It is a topic that is not covered well, especially in the US where wine investing is a controversial subject.This book sells the author's other investment ideas and clearly is a cookie cutter wine investment guide. He knows nothing about wine and the number of pages in this slim volume actually devoted to wine investing are about 10. In these ten pages he covers topics that you can find covered in much more depth and better analysis if you put 'wine investor' into Google. Like the title says - please don't buy this book."
3,un vieux souvenir,"C'est un film que je me rappel que tres vaguement, je me rappel de l'avoir vue plusieurs fois quand j'étais jeune, et je trouvais ca super bon, et maintenant, j'aimerais me rappeler des souvenirs en le voyant de nouveau."
4,Awake,"I understand exactly what she is going through, because I am living it myself. My daughter who is eight years old has EPP which is a porphyria in which she can not be in the sun either. Elizabeth Graver in her writing made me put her disease in perspective."
3,Kept me awake,"Is illness metaphor? Elizabeth Graver explores what it means to be a mother (Anna) with a suppressed self-destruction streak who home-schools a child with XP, a disease that makes sunlight toxic. She has a husband and older child; together they head to a camp run by a rich guy whose daughter also has XP. They frolic at night and sleep most of the day. But Anna, an artist, whose husband, Ian, is drawing away from her, finds herself attracted to Hal, the camp's owner. Anna, in reaching for an emotional and poetic voice, tends to repeat herself, which makes the reading more slow-going than it should be. She's also rather annoying; yes, her situation is bleak and one I wouldn't wish upon anyone, but she's so self-obsessed that you want to shake her by the shoulders and tell her to lighten (ha) up. Still, the story is compelling, and Graver draws well Anna's relationship with her two sons, especially Max, the one with XP."
5,Really works!!!,"Great product, works as advertised!!! I bought this product to see if it would help improve my breathing due to mild asthma. I was somewhat skeptical at first, but thought I give it a try, and I'm glad I did. I started seeing results within first week (twice a day, 3 sets of 10 according to the manual). It's also helped me w/ my swimming performance. Thanks to PowerLung, I'm breathing much better now!!!"
4,Check this one out!,"Just heard 'Be Baba Le Ba' on KFJC 87.9FM Los Altos Hills CA. Blew me away! her strident, supple vocal style is remnescent of Esther Philips,Billie Holliday,and Macie Gray. It's hard to believe this cut was recorded 1950! (@ Shine Auditorium before a wildly enthusiastic audience) There's a sophisticated jazz band behind her, so the jump jive arrangements have seem contemporary. Lots of modern blues wannabe's should note the spontaneous but carefully controlled vocal/instrumental interplay."
3,decent stuff,This product is a decent quality step up from contractor lighting. I was surprised I had to assemble it. Other than that I am pleased with it for the price.
1,not the fan i wanted,The powersupply fan i needed had to be half the thickness of the 80mm fan so that my modular 530watt Hiper powersupply can work. Why say 8cm when we are used to saying 80mm.
5,Awesome book. Highly recommended,I have barely any experience with Citrix before but this book has brought me from nearly zero knowledge of Citrix to being able to Administer a simple Citrix network.I took me only 3 days to read this through and absorb all the information. Very well laid out. Definitely get this book if you need basic to intermediate information on Terminal Server / Metaframe.A++
4,Great Guide for TS Rollout,"Good step wise book for clarification for using both ICA and RDP clients. Easy reading with lots of helpful links to related resources. Could use a step-wise summary for rollouts and go into greater detail for application compatibility issues. Overall, a solid resource and very helpful."
4,A must for those wanting to learn Terminal Server,"This book along with ""Windows NT Thin Client Solutions: Implementing Terminal Server and Citrix Metaframe"" by Mathers et al with provide the newbie with an excellent introduction to the TS/Metaframe environment. The most useful chapter is on security which even has a great deal a relevance to plain NT."
3,WinFrame,"I bought and read this book awhile ago. I took it back for a refund because I found it misleading. I needed a book that focused mainly on Terminal Server and MetaFrame. The title said MetaFrame but the content seemed to focus on WinFrame, the little bit of content devoted to MetaFrame was lacking the in depth information I was looking for and did not cover version 1.8. The book was probably good when first published but is getting outdated."
1,Who's going to buy this now?,"I can recommend this book if you're a young and ambitious IT geek living in the 90s. I bought it, and it helped my career. Perhaps you could buy this book along with ""Building a Time Machine From Discarded PC Components"" and then use it to make a motza in 1996, then sell out just before the dotcom bubble bursts in 2001."
1,how could they?,"Its the authentic arcade emulations I've always wanted, except every game runs way to fast. Most are not even playable. The lack of mouse support for the rotary controler based games is absolutely unforgivable. Sloppy programming and careless implementation do not a good aniversary make. I sincerely hope Infogrames does a better job with its future use of the Atari brand."
3,no controllers or trackballs or paddles,I liked everthingexcept where do I get the right controllers. Tempest is great but pong is hard to play with an analog stick. also breakout is too hard and warlords you can't move fast but that is not a problem on tempest if you know what you are doing.I really like it but it does not save anything.no saves..
1,Atari Anniversary Edition,"This game is very boring. Maybe it's too old. Objects are so tiny that it's very hard to play. Very disappointed after trying all the games. waste money. If you want to get old games, get the Smash pack. It's much much more fun & all games are great."
1,I'm just correcting Conrad.,"Oh my god how old are you Conrad? It is an Atari Package of games not Sega and if you know anything about Atari you would know they make horrible games. Sega already released their Smash Pack, which includes titles from Saturn and Genesis. Don't get too excited people we know Atari's track record. Expect Atari 2600 games or their set of games from the 7800 and beyond. (Nothing innovative in any of their games)"
5,HEYA! Hanson is back and better than ever!,"Ok so we all know that Hanson can rock the house. This single is AMAZING! It's great to hear the Electric Version of Penny and Me, it ROCKS! But...in my opinion Every Word I Say is the reason to buy this single. It is absolutely the MOST amazing song I've heard from them yet. Pure genius. Period. Rock on boys!"
2,good,I'd reccomend this single because it has the tracks Every Word I Say and the radio/shorter version of Penny and Me
3,not a bad book . . .,"This isn't a bad book on Florida travel, unless you want information on the Panhandle; Panama City Beach to Pensacola and surrounding areas. This part of the state isn't even mentioned."
4,a long and winding road...,"This is a great story. It follows a group of friends for many, many years and very openly and honestly lets us into their lives. Nothing is held back--which makes it an even better story! Edgerton has done a fantastic job and lets the readers feel that we really get to know and like these people. They could be our friends!"
4,Great read!,"The book appears too simplistic on first reading but on a second one it reflects the author's deep insight and scholarship into this new and critical area of knowledge management in today's organisation. Great read. We, a consulting firm for media industry, have circulated it amongst our staff and have had half day workshop on it and have made amazing discoveries about the knowledge available within our organisation that has remained untapped. Wish the author had based his/her study on a larger sample of companies/industries and provided tips for applications and larger variety of organisations."
4,useful for practitioners,"This book helped explain many of the paradoxes I had observed ofwell intentioned knowledge sharing efforts not bearing any fruit.As an independent consultant, I find that I can immediately putinto practise many of the ideas presented in this book in myengagements. I also found the practitioner focus box very usefulwhen I want to quickly refresh and refer back to the key learnings."
5,Will take you back...,"This is a short book of ideas on what you can do with your son to build his character and yours as a father. Not only will it make you think about how to raise a child, it will take you back to your childhood memories spent with your father.I don't have a son today but hope to adopt soon. It's a great book for anyone who is a father or nervous about becoming one."
4,Good Book,"Good book for reference and ideas on things for you to do with your son and be an active part of his life. I was given one years ago when my now teenage son was born, just purchase 4, two for my son-in-laws, one with a son and the other expecting and two for friends with new sons."
2,"Overly simplistic,","Overly simplistic, but cute. Mirrors other books using same formula. Nice gift, but not sure I would have bought it for myself if I had held it in my hands before buying."
3,so so book,Wasn't that helpful. Just had basic ideas. No extensive thought or helpful information. This book is more like for a quick gift for a father to be.
1,Disapointed,"When I recieved these shoes, they wern't the ones i ordered. They were a different color, however the same boot. I was really disapointed how cheap the boots appeared. And how they are stricktly meant for fashion, not to protect you from the snow. The fabric on the outside was cheap and thin. Also the inside wasn't as warm as it appeared in the picture. I didn't notice much in size problems but everything was wrong for me."
4,Nice and Comfy and Cute,"I totally disagree with anything written bad about the fit of these shoes...I have purchased them and they are so comfy, I may be investing in another pair very soon! I wear them in the snow, to work, to run errands and I haven't had one single issue with these boots. They probably woul'dnt fit right if you got the wrong size...lol!"
2,not good.. would not purchase again.,perhaps this dvd is just not my cup of tea.. did not like at all.
4,Good book to help through lifes challenges,"Great Catholic-oriented book dealing with struggles of all sorts. The writer (from St. Crispin Friary in Bronx, NY) has a fresh and realistic approach to loss, lifes shortcomings and suffering. However, I purchased this book for a friend who had recently lost his young wife, and was left with two young children. The chapter on death was a little too tongue and cheek (i.e. ""They better not be any Hallulujahs at my funeral"") and short on the empathy for the survivors. The author also talks a little too much about Purgatory, without explanation. What is nice about this book is that the author ends each chapter with an approriate prayer for the struggle. If bought for the purpose of working through grief, I would recommend it in conjunction with other meatier books on grief."
5,Anxiety ..Deprssion ???,Father Benedict beautifully imparts all you need to know of how to overcome all your worries and doubts......An all around loving Father tells his children that God truly Loves you and will grant you all the grace you need to LOVE HIM !!!
1,Blame your victims,"Perhaps the Friar should reread his own book. It is one thing to commit a crime but it is another to blame your victims.""In some of these cases, children ""looking for a father figure"" are responsible for the relationship with someone in a position of power -- like a coach or clergy member, Groeschel told the National Catholic Register.""Suppose you have a man having a nervous breakdown, and a youngster comes after him. A lot of the cases, the youngster - 14, 16, 18 - is the seducer,"" said Groeschel, a founder of the Franciscan Friars of the Renewal.Pressed on the point, Father Groeschel says ""It's not so hard to see - a kid looking for a father and didn't have his own - and they won't be planning to get into heavy-duty sex, but almost romantic, embracing, kissing.""Read more:[...]"
5,It's hilarious!,"I gave two Homer's Heads as prizes at a recent party. They were opened immediately and became a major distaction the remainder of the night. It is so funny to see Homer's head get twisted up, in Rubik's Cube fashion (there are 8 pieces in all). You can't keep from laughing, no matter how challenging the puzzle is to solve.These two worked fine and took a lot of abuse all night long.I'm really happy I bought them; I think Homer's Head is a great gift to make people laugh again."
2,Homer Head,"Purchased two of these both fell to pieces after a short while. Not worth the money. If you purchase it, leave it in the package."
1,"Fun, but cheaply made","I greatly enjoyed this puzzle for about 20 minutes. After that, it was in broken pieces. The problem is the oddly shaped pieces do not align well, and any amount of force breaks the inner structure and ruins the whole toy. So, if it was made better it would be an awesome toy. However, its so cheaply made I dont recommend getting it."
5,Simpsons Woo Hoo!,"As long as it's the simpsons I'll buy most toys that have anything to do with the simpsons is not only fun to play with but also to collect, and this toy is definently both. Woo Hoo!"
1,Please dont waste your money on this product,this item does nothing and it brakes all the time. It is a mayor waste of money. It is also no fun
1,oh please,"A superb writer? A radical stylist? Don't believe a word of it.Bankroll any twenty-year-old in a creative writing course; ask him to forget all about such nonsense concerns as plot, dialogue, characterization, and structure; keep telling him he writes fantastically well even if he doesn't; inflate his ego until he believes English prose begins (and, I shudder to add, will one day end) with him--in short, encourage your protégé to indulge in all his sophomoric whims and half-baked hunches and you'll end up with a ""novel"" in your hand that's a lot like this one here, though in all probability it won't be nearly half as bad."
4,Don't throw stones if you're not up on your birds...,"This is a great old children's picture book from 1963.I received it as a child in 1964, and read it over and over,pouring over the illustrations. There's a simple moral to it,and the illustrations are reminiscent of early Sendak.Arnold Lobel is the author and illustrator, and does a terrificjob at both.The basic moral is don't be mean as it could come back to bite you,but if you do good, even the bad can be forgiven.I just reread this. There's a pivotal part where the bad prince beans a witch with a stone and is turned into a little dragon--shunned, he runs away, into the woods with a basket of ginger snaps (makes sense). There he meets a variety of wild animals:lions, porcupines and other beasts. They roar at him and eat his ginger snaps.It's a gentle tale with a happy ending."
2,Not what I ordered.,"I ordered this product but instead received a bag with a smaller version of the same body wash, a lotion, one bar of soap and a sponge. I like the product but not the mistake in shipping the wrong package."
2,No support and out-dated item: Don't buy!!,"This camera looks handy and neat, but you cannot find a controller to connect it any more as the product is about 5 years old. NO MORE TECHNICAL SUPPORT (this was one of the major reasons that I bought it with good review on the support part!)!!! Too bad was I opened the package and installed it already. I can only keep it as a fun toy or hopefully I can find a matching system one day in the future! Let me know if anyone has a box to give out/away :o Cute little fake thing now! Don't keep changing the products like this without help..."
4,Not What You Might Think,"I've read some of the reviews that are dogging on such a mainstream show insincerely showcasing the indie scene. I've actually been to L.A., met Josh Schwartz, and I can honestly say that for the most part, he's very sincere. The guys about 26, and Adam Brody's character is modeled very much after himself, including his love for indie music. My cousin worked on the set for the entire first season, and says the same thing.As far at the album, and my opinion of it, I would have bought the entire album for the Reindeer Section's contribution. I wrote my first music review on that song, and it landed me the job.Even if you can't stand this show, this album is worth a listen."
4,GREAT AUSSIE VERSION,"Awsome cd,really like the added touch of Seths artwork on the cd cover etc :). Awsome cd great mix of rock, chill and lots of alternative artests. REALLY REALLY happy they brought out the Australian version with Evermores 'FOR ONE DAY', awsome song. For all over sea customers, try and get hold of the australian version of OC mix 4 it has the same 12 songs but with evermores song as a bonus. Well worth it!"
4,Nice Mix if you watch the show,"Get this for the Matt Pond Pa version of Champange Supernova, also Cartwheels by the Reindeer Section. Was hoping maybe to have enhanced with some scenes from the show but hey what can you do? Anyways pick this up."
2,"Wow, way to just rape the indie scene","oc mixes are just annoying in general because the creators regard themselves as ""cultural tastemakers"" and ""arbiters of cool""...really so lame...kids, if you want to check out cool music, do so on your own; the oc just tries to be hip. but mainly, i was incensed enough to write this review because of Matt pond PA's disgusting, really horrible cover of Champagne supernova...really why mess with this godlike, classic oasis beauty? now ill admit ryan adam's cover of wonderwall was aching, expressive, and heartfelt, but Matt pond, what were you thinking? really? you did nothing with this gem! and it's just really lame."
5,Girl OBSESSED with The O.C. This is the best mix EVER!!,"This mix was yet another succcess. It had many brilliantly performed songs which otherwise would have probably never been heard. I just wish they had ""Hide and Seek"" by Imogen Heap. That's the only flaw of this mix. Otherwise it had really good songs like ""The View"" by Modest Mouse and ""Champagne Supernova"" by matt pond PA. Ur totally gonna luv this mix!!"
3,Hm...,"I really think that it was the best mix out of all The O.C. mixes, but there is one bad point. The first half is full of all these good songs, while the last half is so boring that you'd rather go to sleep..."
5,Great program!,"Loved this series, and hope that it comes back, looking forward to the 3rd. Season.And will purchase the 2nd Season when it comes out. Thank you!!"
5,Love the Western Theme!,"This was a Christmas present for my son,who is an avid fan.I've come to enjoy it myself,and would recommend it to anyone who likes historical shows."
5,Excellent Video,Have enjoyed this video very much. Received promptly. Price was right. Have truly gotten much enjoyment from it. Hopefully season 2 will come out on video soon and will order that also...
3,It is no Deadwood..........,"I had expected Deadwood, I am not going to lie. I have never understood shows/movies where someone has been killed, it is okay to kill like 5 other people that many not have even been involved in the crime."
1,32 minutes?,It froze after 32 minutes even though I had the best connection possible and never came back on at the 32 minute mark.
4,Another quality show from AMC,"Great writing and incredible set production highlight the first season of this new AMC offering. It has a few storyline stumbles along the way, but a great freshman effort. I'm looking forward to what season 2 has to offer."
1,Sound and picture does not match up.,How hard is it to fix something like this. I dont see why this has not been fixed 6 days ago
1,Don't BUY...video in slow motion & sound out of sync,I was looking forward to watching the latest installment of this show but when I started it...what a disappointment! The video is in sloooow motion and the sound runs much faster so you hear something way before you see it.
1,Hell on Wheels Esp 8,The whole thing is out of sync....What gives? So disappointing and unprofessional. When can this be fixed since we have already paid for it?
1,ARGHHHHHHHHHH,This is out of sync.It is not me....everything else works.I called Amazon and they said it would be a few days to fix.Squeak the wheels people. We paid for this episode!
5,Awesome Period Piece,"I can't speak on the historical accuracy of this dramatization, but for pure entertainment value - it's great. Watched this first season free streaming on Netflix and purchased the second season from Amazon because we enjoyed it so much. What a good bargain this first season is here on Amazon too, I may purchase the DVDs as well. Some episodes are a bit graphic, showing lots of blood and scalping but it really gives you a good feel of the wild wild west and the struggles of the building of the railroad. Also really like Anson Mount as a lead. Last thing I saw him in was Crossroads with Britney Spears so this is a definite step up and he really is a phenomenal actor, along with Common who plays Mr. Ferguson. Highly recommend. Great production and great acting."
2,"Four star show, zero stars for video","The show itself is enjoyable enough -- not ""Deadwood,"" but better than a lot of what is on television. However, episodes 8 and 9 are unwatchable. Actually, you can watch them, but there is no audio, just a screeching noise. I gave up after about five minutes.I contacted Amazon customer support who told me that they were waiting for new video to be provided by the content owner/creator . . . but meanwhile there are two episodes that cannot be seen? After a second email the price of a single episode was refunded to me."
2,"Good story line, not sure about the acting",Wanted to enjoy this. The story line has potential but I couldn't get beyond the acting. There is some violence that seemed to be used to fill the screen rather than being necessary to the plot. This is the pilot episode so perhaps it gets better?
1,Legal Issues,Customer service tried to tell me that there is some of kind of legal mix-up that prevents them from simply deleting the bad product and replacing it with another copy. Only a corporation could screw up something so simple.
1,video screwed up,Video is in slow motion while audio progresses normally. Not cool at all.This is a rating of the downloadable video product and not for the show. I tend to enjoy the show very much.
1,Bad video // amazon drops ball over and over,"Like everyone else, I got slammed with the messed up video of episode #8. I made call after call and sent many emails and was finally handed the ""license agreement"" excuse where amazon claims they can't release any more episodes of Hell on Wheels right now. Yeah sure."
1,It's now a week later & it is still not fixed!,"The video drags unbelievably slow, while the audio just marches right on. Then the audio goes away all together. Amazon, it's about time this got fixed."
1,Audio/Video out of sync since 1/1/12,"As the title says, the video runs in slow motion while the audio seems to run at normal speed. Ongoing since January 1st, quite a time frame to have it replaced. It obviously didn't air on TV in this fashion as you can tell from numerous free streaming sites throughout the internet."
1,Don't subscribe to this series!! Corrupt Files,"The last two episodes of the series have been corrupted, and as mentioned in other reviews, the video and audio are out of synch, and the video is playing back very slowly. Yet, Amazon happily keeps billing those of us who have subscribed to the series, and is making no visible effort to alleviate the problem."
4,The series will capture your interest.,AMC has really cranked out some ground breaking series. Hell On Wheels is another series that meets or exceeds the high bar of entertainment that AMC has set. The characters and plot are very interesting and exciting.
5,Hell on Wheels Season,"I was recommended this Series by a friend and I am totally hooked. Can't wait for Season 3. It was just amazing how they ended Season 2. The set, the cast, the writing are just terrific. I am mezmerized every week."
3,Mediocre,"I like westerns and this time period so I thought I'd give it a shot. Though the show seems ""cheaper"" and the writers aren't Breaking Bad-worthy, the show seems to move along pretty well. It's sometimes hard to get into a show that reflects times past as historical accuracy needs to be pretty sharp to keep the viewer's full attention. That to me determines whether a film or tv show is noteworthy. I will point out that the hymn sang during the pilot episode during one of the character's baptism actually didn't exist in 1865. Just saying. Also, I hope they don't keep meshing all the music together, it can set a tone for the film but if its overdone it just comes off as cheesy"
4,Took awhile,"I admit i wasnt blown away by first episode, but it certainly builds over the season into a great show."
5,OUTSTANDING SERIES!!! A MUST SEE!!!,"I caught episode 6 while channel surfing last week and I was instantly hook. There were only a few episodes on demand through my satellite. I found the beginning of the series on Amazon and quickly caught up.The show is about the construction of the Union Pacific railroad shortly after the end of the Civil War. The show is historically accurate and the locations transport you to that time.Common is OUTSTANDING as Elam Ferguson! The characters are well developed and the acting is superb.I usually watch the HBO series, The Wire, Oz, Trueblood etc. because the stories can be told with less editing and a realness. This series can can compare with any of those shows.AMC has a great thing going and I hope that word gets out and people start tuning in. I am waiting on season 2 already."
4,video and audio not not in sync (FIXED),"Update (2-4-12): Video is working.'Hell on Wheels' Season 1, Episode 8: 'Derailed'. video and audio not not in sync on TV download. please fix!! I also tried the new episode 8 on computer and it had the same audio and video sync problem."
1,Picture and sound way out of sync,"The video and sound are out of sync in episode 8, which makes it worthless. The sound is way ahead of the picture. I confirmed this by playing episode 7 on the same computer, which worked perfectly. I also tried the new episode 8 on another computer and it had the same audio and video sync problem. I updated adobe flash player and even tried unchecking hardware acceleration. It still does not work and is an example of a poor product."
1,"Corrupt File, DO NOT BUY!!","This and the last video in the series are corrupt. It's a known issue with Amazon, it's been this way for a few weeks. And yet, they happily continue to bill those of us who subscribed to the series, knowing full well that what they're charging us for is unusable. I have wised up and unsubscribed."
4,Spaghetti aldente,"Though in my opinion the pilot was the weakest offering the show has progressed and the characters are falling into their own and not just two dimentional paper cowboys. Though it may only aspire to the loftyness of Deadwood it is still a enjoyable way to spend 43 minutes. In many ways the rawness reminds me of Spartacus: Blood and sand, maybe not emmy winning or a critics best but sets it's hooks in you and makes you look forward to the next"
3,"Deadwood ""lite""","Decent show, but was like a Deadwood ""lite"" for me. Gritty like Deadwood, but not as well written or acted."
5,Slow going but well worth it.,"AMC is still making the best shows on TV, and this one is near the top. It takes a while to develop the characters, but if you stick it out then the wait is well worth it."
5,I love this dvd,"This was a well written and well acted movie concerning the events effecting ex slaves, Native Americans, women, and immigrants in this period of time."
1,boring,stupid sub plots poor story lines totally predictable .who would dig a rail line in a creek bed.no explanation for black powder explosions.
4,A genre that has been much missed - Well worth watching,"Firstly this is a review only about the pilot and not an impression of the whole season. As with all first episodes much of the program is about setting up characters for the rest of the season. We have the bad guy (Railway tycoon), the good or bad guy (man on a mission), the probable love interest, the side plots etc. The acting was okay with Colm Meany playing Colm Meany and everybody else doing a reasonable job. The best part for me is the time period. As America moves through various 150 year anniversaries of events in the civil war it is a brave move to have a program set a short period after the end of the war. There are bound to be people watching this who will hold strong, personal views of slavery, the war the Union etc. Hopefully they will be entertained whilst having their thoughts provoked in a positive manner.In brief a good start with promises of a thought provoking series."
4,Hell on wheels review,I love this series Hell On Wheels. I compare it to lonesome dove. Very well produced. Loved the fact that I could get this online immediately without having to buy the whole series. Thank You Amazon
1,Episode 8,We really like this show but also have the same problem with episode 8. It won't play correctly on either of my Roku boxes or my computer. The audio is way out of sync as others have reported. All the other episodes are fine. I have sent an email to customer service. Waiting for a response.
5,engaging and entertaining,"I enjoyed this episode as much as any other; it's a well done and well written show. It does of course have to address issues of racism, as well it should, but it does so in a fair and sometimes darkly humorous way. It may be noted, too, that the central figure is a white male, who, although gruff, is also portrayed as at times sensitive (for example, soothing an injured horse before he euthanizes it) and heroic. All of the characters, even Durant, have dimension to them, which is a rare thing to find on T.V. Westerns are not my favorite genre, but I will be faithful to this show as long as it keeps portraying interesting (if not always sympathetic) characters."
4,"Looks Promising. However, ...","I would probably continue viewing the series. However, the price is too steep for my pocketbook. If you want my attention, drop the price."
2,get lost,"Its so disgustingly obvious and I know it was originally a serialized story but how did the victorian people not go 'omg the kid on page 2 is the prince' they couldn't have been that dumb. its all so very...condescending, you can actually just skip over 90% of the book and not miss anything."
2,Love da Lost Prince,Ever since I laid my hands on dat book I could't stop reading it.I loved the susspense and hard work dat Frances put in da book.This book is amazing!!!!:)
2,The Balkans will always be a mess.,"This book is located in an unidentified eastern european state but the implications point to the Balkans and Bosnia/Serbia. The novel is an overy romantic tale of instilling race-hatred and drafting children into warfare. I love F.H.B.'s well known novels but this one frightened me. Today's newpaper front page is full of orphaned child soldiers from eastern europe,Rwanda and Sudan that are not really very different from the main characters of this book. Do not put this book into the hands of young children, it needs to be read in historical context."
3,Great old games !,"I bought this game mainly for Asteroids, centipide and Black widow.I played the other games but those 3 where the ones i liked more.I am ussing the PS3 80G 2usb port and a 1080p LCD tv to play this games and I can't get to see the laser shots in both Asteroids and Asteroids Deluxe, this is frustrating because you can hear the sound of the shots but not see them.ALso try playing PONG with the PS3 control !!!! it's nearly imposible to control the sliding bar and rebound the ball; same aplies to Super Breakout.One more thing, in the description and on the CD it says you get a FREE ATARI STICKER, this is not true.I looked everywhere and i couldn't find it."
3,hard games,I bought this game because i thought it would be fun to relive memories fo the past and share the same memories with my kids but after playing and watching them play i realized these games are harder than todays games.Great for memories and a challenge but definately tricky couldn't remember how to play half of them. So I would say not for kids
2,Too old for this generation!,I like it but my grandkids only use it once in a Blue Moon...it's just to old for this generation!
3,Tornado in Action,"As usual the Squadron Signal Publications fills one of the most relevant combat aircraft in post WWII era, a multinational program under the auspicies of the German, Great Britain and Italy goberments. The book cover the history of the aircraft development, the users and a brief accounting of the performance in the Gulf War As a plastic modeller I think, that need more photos of the interior"
5,It is wonderfull,"It is really good for kids, I would recommended to parents, my son ask me to let him see it over and over again."
4,It is great. My kids love it.,My kids love dinosaurs and they love this series. They learn a lot and it also reinforces what they already know about dinosaurs. they can't wait to watch it every day.
5,Son loves it,This is one of very few shows my son will watch. He is only one and he loves this show. We watch it every night at bedtime.
4,Educational & Attention Getting!,"I know this is made for young children but I caught myself glued to the screen with my son. I love how the dinosaur parents buy their children tickets and take them on the dinosaur train for an eductaional ride to places. It reminds me of the magic school bus, except it's on a younger level.My son loves the idea that the a baby trex ended up in the pteradon nest and is now an official memeber of that family since he hatched. They go on many educationl & fun trips. Only bummer is the show only last about 11-13 minutes about like a youtube video and my son wished so much each one was longer."
5,My son loves it!,"My 3 year old son loves these shoes. I like them too because unlike a lot of children shows out there that dumb down their scripts, they use proper words (big words) for things and explain them so that the kids can learn. We want to start watching Season 2 now."
5,CARIA CRETOXYRHIA,"I bought this book from Amazon for my daughter who is 11 and has turners syndrome..She was so excited about the clarity and beautiful colors in the video. My daughter fell in love with the dinosaur train and the wonderful songs and charactors. My daughtor could not stop talking about the train and meeting a huge fish that was so sweet. Caria was so sweet and so personable that it drew my daughter right into the story; and she could not wait to see what happened next.This book was a wonderful and colorful way to introduce my child into the world of dinosaurs and all their friends. I would reccommend all parents, grandparents and teachers to buy this series and this particular vidio.You can't go wrong and you and your stories its educational and fun so thank you !!!"
1,"Amazon disingenuous ""owenership"" policy","Love dinosaur train, however, even though Amazon says I ""own"" this video, when I tried to play it for my daughter while visiting relatives in Canada, I was BARRED, the content was only available in the U.S.So...purchased it on I-tunes, and have had no problems. Will NOT be purchasing any more digital items from Amazon - apparently their ideas of ""ownership"" are a little more fluid than mine are."
3,It's entertaining but there isn't a lot of educational value to it.,"Dinosaur Train is a fairly cute show but, it wears on my nerves after awhile. I find the show is more entertaining than educational. Also, there is something really annoying about the way the dinosaur kids talk that I can't put my finger on."
5,Wonderful little show.,"My three grandsons ages 4,4 & 1 all three love this show. I will buy more in the future!! Recommend to everyone with little ones, very educational about dinosaurs also."
1,False advertisement,This says Seaon One in its title when it actually is only one episode from Season One...it was only .99cents so it's no big deal but its not as advertised
5,All Aboard the Greatest Train In History,"Dinosaurs are amazing. Trains are amazing.This show brought more meaning to my life than I could possibly express in words. Thank you, PBS, for putting together such an excellent work of educational entertainment.Dinosaur train rules! This should be mandatory watching for kids of all ages (0-99+). :)"
5,Too much fun,"My 2 year old is obsessed with the dinosaur train, and honestly I love it too! She can look at pictures of dinosaurs and tell people what kind of dinosaur they are, and that is just from watching the show. This is the only TV show she watches; and it is over and over, and does not appear to tire from it. I have to admit my husband and I find ourselves singing the opening song at times! I am not a fan of many of the pre-school tv shows, but this one is definitely a 5 star one!"
2,Pirate Copy from German TV show,"This is a VHS to DVD duplication from a very old German TV show.So don't expect any good picture quality.Though audio quality is good.Since this seems to be the only Supertramp concert available on DVD, you still might want to buy it.Don't miss Supertramp on tour this fall !!!"
3,Over-priced but works as advertised,Fairly easy to install and does a great job at protecting your gear. You cannot however use the center tube umbrella mount with it installed. Certain Elinchrom softboxes that use light deflectors will require that you remove the dome.
3,Ok Collection,"I was a fan of John Crowley, and I still am. I read the collection Otherwise: Three Novels, and I thought it was absolutely brilliant, especially Engine Summer and Beasts. I would recommend those two emphatically. The collection Novelties and Souvenirs overall was just OK. In fact, if I had read this first instead of Otherwise, I probably never would have read anything by John Crowley again. He is a great writer but his best work simply isn't seen here."
4,At last!,"Giant are/were a ""supergroup"" of the early-mid 90's, comprising the Huff brothers (also renown as producers), and a couple of mates on keys and bass.They went on ice after 2 releases, and this is a collection of stuff that didn't make those 2 releases - although hopefully they'll get on and write some new stuff soon.The style is very 90's stadium rock, big choruses, vocals vaguely Brian Adams (but higher), and phenomenal guitar playing (the first track is an Eruption-like number). Most of the songs are pretty good too, although there are one or two that could be better, which is presumably why they were initially left on the shelf!Production is (of course) superb.Certainly good enough for the established fan, perhaps not the best introduction to the band (get Time to Burn first) for the novice, and I'm happy with it."
5,"The CD's Price? ""Sky Is The Limit""","Giant is one of the greatest find in a last few years. They produced the albums with great reputation during the late 80s and early 90s while I was almost away from American music with the exception of Bad English, Brian Adams and Richard Marx. (Sorry Giant was still not in my dictionary in 1992).It took no time before I love this CD. It is really an excellent combination of wildness and catchy aspect of hard rock reminding me of early Loverboy, Survivor and Foreigner. My #1 favorite is Love Can't Help You Now, which should become their comeback US hit. Sky Is The Limit that follows is great fun pop. Wow and their Robart Palmer cover ""Bad Case of Loving You"" is a nice case of covering Robert. If you love 80's rock, you will definitely love it."
5,Must read for Christians,"This is a must-read for Christians. The author takes the reader through the Beatitudes, short prayers, and connects them to the icon of the Ladder of Divine Ascent. I love how Jim Forest connects the Beatitudes to modern life. The book gives you so much to think about. It is personal, reflective, and interesting. It is a book I will read often for the rest of my life."
5,fantastic & great price,This was a gift I gave to my 12 year old drummer son. He loves it. It hold plenty of sticks with plenty of compartments for accessories. I was nervous to order because of such low price but this was a great choice.I would forsure order this for any of his drum buddies also.
1,Quality is very low but price is right,"I am not sure what ""Duraguard"" refers to, but the bag is made of a cheap material which I expect will crack and deteriorate over time. That said, the cost was so low, I should have expected this level of quality. It does serve my purpose, but I will be buying a new one in the near future."
1,"I wouldn't even give it 1 Star, 0 stars would be better said","yeah, I bought this camera thinking that it was great, for the first week that is. The backup battery only works if it has 90% power. If there's less it doesn't work. My camera doesn't read my CF card. Sometimes it does, but when I turn off the camera, it forgets the CF Card was even in there. Also, the internal memory will sometimes say it's full; but when you go to see if there's pics the camera says there's no pics. The camera was a joke from the start. I have wasted money trying to get this thing to work."
1,stay away,It is a piece of crap. I have not been able to take one photo on it yet. The only thing that has worked on it is the lcd screen. Stay away.
5,The best merengue,"Juan Luis nos sigue impresionando con sus temas populares y comtemporaneos. Sus liricas estan muy al dia con la realidad y el diario vivir de nuestros compatriotas. Su devastadora critica social y politica a la mala administracion de nuestra amada Republica, nos recuerda que nos es facil,""Cruzar el Niagatra en Bicicleta"".Keep up the good work Juan Luis."
3,Dissapointing return of a music innovator.,"After years of volutary retirement, Juan Luis Guerra & 440 has released a cd that is similar to his previous efforts although the title may mislead you. I expected a longer/better album from him."
4,Juan Luis is back at his best !,"Listening to a new material from Juan Luis is a sublime experience. This album has 11 beautiful songs. ""Mi PC"" and ""Vale la pena"" are a perfect rhythmical 1-2, ""La hormiguita"" and ""Palomita blanca"" are future bachata classics. ""El Niagara en bicicleta"" is simply astonishing, ""El primo"" is in the wave of ""La Gallera"" and the acoustic songs are superb. This album is a smash one and confirms Juan Luis as the most complete latin artist of this time..may be of all time."
5,"Es arte, y como cuesta encontrarlo ahora...","Juan Luis Guerra nos vuelve a dar un respiro dentro de tanta basura comercial. Por suerte sale al mercado al mismo tiempo que Ricky Martin y otras imagenes para contrabalancear y dejar claro que la belleza en la musica latina todavia se puede rescatar, aun dentro de la avalancha de productos populares."
4,Juan Luis Guerra returns with a lot of energy!!!!,"The title of this new work reveals Guerra's intention to change, but in essence keeping his legendary style. From rhytmic merengues like ""Mi PC"" to bachatas like ""La hormiguita"" this new CD makes me remember his previous works, but also adapting it to today's world. His poet-like lyrics and rich rhytm will make you enjoy every single second. A good coming back of Juan Luis Guerra, hoping he could continue on keeping on sharing his art with us for a long long time!!!"
5,Vale la pena!!!,"Truly an exquisite album with a nice mix of caribbean rythms...I've admired the eclectic approach of Juan luis Guerra, who can make crafty ""pop"" merengue or even baladas, without losing sight of mantaining good lyrics...favorites on this album for me were ""la Hormiguita"" with a beatiful cuatro that is played throughout...the poetic lyrics are an abslute joy to listen to...there is another great highlight on this album called ""La Niagara en Biclecta"" a song with social relevance about the state of medicine in some of our countries....the kyrics are somewhat humorous but true to life...however my favorite track off the album is ""palomita blanca"" not for lyrics but for the sheer beauty of the melody....this is an album that will not disappoint-it also can appeal to non-latino audiences...a Polish friend listened to this and wanted a copy immediatley..a great album by a maturing musician whose best work is still not behind him...."
2,Acceptable Item,"The item was ""acceptable"" although I was disappointed to find that there were scratches in the glass ornament that were not supposed to be there. It actually looked *old* instead of *new*. Had I seen this item on the shelf in the store, I would not have purchased it for the cost. I expected a new looking item, but got a scratched up one."
3,Lousy Craftsmanship But Works Beyond Expectation,"All these Sabatier Elite Knives are NOT symmetrical, uneven, NOT well balanced, NOT smooth at all and NOT straight on both handle and blade. I went to a local store and looked at 3 new sets on the shelf, none of them look identical. The salesman said they are hand crafted. Umm.. So the look really disturb me. Compare with Henckels International Classic, Henckels are perfect on the blade, straight and slick, handles are not perfect but far more even and symmetrical then the Sabatier Elite.Cutting and Slicing feels smooth and effortless, really beyond my expectation and worries. I will keep the set."
4,Snooks in the 70s,"After his very productive sixties Snooks Eaglin made two nice LPs for the Sonet label -- sort of a transition between the ""folk blues"" and Imperial-sides and his funkier Black Top-period. It was not the highest point of his career, but undoubtedly nice music. This Grammercy CD offers a near-complete selection of this material. Simply produced (without any information, even without a catalogue number), but goiod music, for a nice price.A.J. HEERMA VAN VOSS, Amsterdam"
2,Plays poorly with Macs,"I purchased one of these in January for use in classroom presentations. The image quality is adequate for text, but graphics tend to be a good deal worse than they are with a lap top.The big problem for me, however, is the same as for other Mac users. If you upgrade to Panther (system 10.3) you start having problems. I'm still able to convert Keynote and PowerPoint presentations into the format that the system uses -- but it's hit and miss.Customer support on this issue was clueless. Mac users should beware."
2,Does not work for me,I have a Palm Zire 71. The connector to the palm seems like very hard to stay on. I have not tried on a real projector yet but I can't get it to display on my monitor.Keep in mind that the way this works is that it convert your powerpoint files into little images. You transfer it to your palm and then display it. So you won't see powerpoint animations. So even if it works it will only give you limited ability. (What do you expect from a little Palm?)
4,Great resource,"This book is a great resource for those trying to start a mystery shopping company which would include merchandising. There could be more information on getting clients. What is covered is basic marketing. Case studies from the authors would have been very helpful. Overall, the information was very useful and I've already started the business."
5,EXCELLENT for taste and flavor,"Dust your cookies......or impress dinner guest when serving coffee. Any India Tree product lives up to high standards. Buy with confidence for delivery, taste and quality."
5,Very good item,Lexar it's a very good brand for your choose of a memory device. I've a memory stick format 128mb since 1 year and a half and I think it's better than other brands.
1,IF YOU HAVE A TEKXON DIGITAL CAMERA DO NOT GET THIS!,IF YOU HAVE A TEKXON DIGITAL CAMERA DO NOT GET THIS because when you put the memory card in and you turn the camera on the screen goes black!
2,Stressful 30 minutes,"My brother got a Lexar for Christmas. He put it in his Tungsten C and for 30 stressful minutes the card did not work. The device recognized the card, but you could not copy, format, nothing... just got an error ""This card is read only and cannot be <whatever>."" Then all of a sudden it started working. 2 stars for the stress and for the fear that it will stop working again."
5,WORTH EVERY PENNY,"I have spent more money than I can count on FM transmitters for various iPods that I have had. By far, This is the best. Very easy to set up and use. If fact, it came with no instructions--its that easy--plug and play. No downloading of channels on the iPod either. If you have a Nano, you have to have this for your car."
1,weak signal,Have to constantly change radio stations to get hear ipod. Was never clear and dangerous to have to keep searching for a station while driving. waste of $
2,Airplay boost,"Not impressed with this particular transmitter. I have had earlier models for the larger Ipod that have worked much better. Reception can be a little hazy. However, RFI or other interference could be the culprit. The additional antenna should have increased distance and reception, but from testing it, I found that the maximum distance you can travel from the receiver is about the same as other XtremeMac devices."
3,"Nice, but theres better","Once it's set to a good station, no static. It is a pain when you turn off the car and you have to pause or turn off the transmitter. Then when you start your car back up, you have to turn it back on and it takes a couple seconds because the logo pops up when turned on. Besides that it's small and sleek. No wires so anywhere in the car it can be controlled. Even though it's nice for the price, I'd pay extra for one that fits my picky needs."
4,"Not a bad product at all, great for the price.","This is my first FM transmitter, and I can't find anything wrong with it. It does work a little differently in different vehicles and there is minimal static. I live in a pretty large city (San Antonio) and have found a few stations that this works on. I definitely recommend this product as a first time buy, unless you don't mind spending the money for other transmitters. If I absolutely had to say something bad about this product, it would be that it does seem a little fragile, but I've had it for a couple of months and it still works fine."
1,Don't Buy This - Doesn't work,"I bought this in anticipation of a easy way to listen to my iPod on any stereo. It just simply doesn't work. Unless you like driving like you are in the mountains where there is static on all the radio stations and the sound tunes in and then out again, this product isn't for you. The 1 star is for the fact that it is a nice idea anyway."
1,Rip Off Alert,Direct Source CD's are always very inferior remakes of very good songs. Do not support this kind of deception.
4,What was the drug Richard gave them?,"This was a sad, bleak movie. It was the type of movie I will watch and at times ask myself while I'm watching it - ""WHY ARE YOU WATCHING THIS?!?!?!?"" In any case it was difficult to watch parts of this but I am very glad that the main character, Richard, gets his revenge. Richard is played by Paddy Considine who also stars in Red Riding 1980, another movie I heartily recommend."
2,"Brutal and gruesome, lacks depth.","A brutal horror movie that is dark, realistic and gruesome. After having seen the reviews here I expected alot but boy was I disapointed. This movie lacks depth mainly during the first 3/4 of the film and for that reason along with the fact I just didn't like gave 2 stars."
2,Same old same old...,"Same old same old... revenge of the wronged, killing of the evil doers...with a twist though: very effective, raw and brutal. Good acting."
4,British humor,"not really, this is a tragic and gory tale of a brother's love and the extent he's willing to go to show just that. the brutal and gut-wrenching scenes in this movie will leave you depressingly numb, just the way i like it!"
4,"Dark, scary,funny, compelling all in one.","Dead mans shoes has you from the very first moment, glued to the screen. The characters portrayed in this movie are like people i've actually seen growing up in the midlands before I left the UK in 1983.The scumbag mentality, bullying,petty crime and the inability to string a sentence together is all to prevalent in England today, and the rage felt by people embroiled in this world is all to real and surfaces in the towns portrayed in this picture.Paddy Considine is downright scary as the Ex-para and Gary Stretch and Toby Kebbell's portrayal of the lowlife pretty-boy gangster and the retarded brother are just as authentic.It's theme is nothing new, but I can honestly say I have never watched a movie that portrays revenge for injustice quite like this. I was one moment laughing out loud , then chillingly scared stiff a second later."" Can you come outside.......we're going to shoot you?.....i dunno... any better ideas?""Watch it. Be prepared."
3,"OK, movie, definitely not 4 or 5 star though","I bought this based on all the high reviews - it shouldn't be that high - it's a good movie - but as other have put it, it's a simple plot. I didn't find it that gory at all compared to today's movies so I wonder why so many say that ? And I wish it had English subtitles (only Spanish) as 5minutes in I went looking to put on subtitles. It's not impossobile to understand, but it can be hard at times with the accents. I rate it as just a decent low-budget movie."
3,Ok Design Not Perfect,"I really liked using these. Use them every day.However the ring on the bottom is welded to the mesh. So if small particles of food, anything that is sticky or does not rinse immediately out, then, these substance can stuck since there is the opening is blocked by the ring.You may have to use a tooth brush or similar tool to get out any debris.Quick frankly, I dont know the solution. As the ring really provides much needed stability. It can be frustrating for a mesh strainer to loose its shape and that hasn't happen yet."
4,Just what I needed!,"I've used these for a couple months now and have absolutely no complaints. I've used them for everything from pasta to washing fruit; they clean so easily, whether hand-washing or dropping into the top rack of the dishwasher. I don't use heat dry in dishwasher so everything air dries and there's been no trace of rust. Thanks much!!"
5,Great card and fast for saving images!,"I've been using the Lexar 24x card for a few months now and have no problems whatsoever to date. The difference between this card and the cheapo 4x cards is really noticeable when saving images to the card - and with the guarantee, it's well worth the extra money. I felt even better too when I saw a professional photographer changing cards - and saw the same brand (but instead a 1GB card - a little out of my price range :) )!"
1,Embarrassingly awful text,"I had the displeasure of teaching out of this textbook (my boss, the author, required its purchase by every Freshman English student at the university), and it's disgracefully inept. Laden with grammatical errors and indulging in bizarre pedagogy (oxymorons as the cornerstone of all good writing? Why not symbolism or juxtaposition?), this text was rightfully scorned by students. The less I used it, the higher my student evals."
5,This bookis a family favorite of ours!,"I have a large family, and this book was one that we have loved for more than 20 years. Our copy was taped together from over-use. I have it entirely memorized, as do my children. It was a favorite bedtime book. When my daughter was expecting, she wanted to have a copy for herself, so she could read it to her baby. I highly recommend and love this book!"
5,Escargot,"Many times i bought this product and i will be buying it as long as the quality is the same !! Escargot are not a delicacy for me but a real meal,i love them in various ways of cooking them, creating different dishes !!!"
1,Doesn't work with Comcast,There should at least be a warning for something like that considering how Comcast is the most widely used cable internet provider.
4,The Official History and Manual GUOOF in America,"This documented history of the black order (GUOOF)is a very clear view of the organization, it's growth, and rites. With a nonexisting documentation for the GUOOF makes this this book even that more value. Great histroy by Charles Brooks."
1,Not Enough Bush,"Ok, so Barbara Bush got her picture on the cover, but the section about her is way too small to justify buying this book. I really interested in the sections on Reagan and Bush, but we need more. Perhaps the author could write another book focused mainly on these two mother-figures of our nation."
4,I use it for non medical purposes!,Use your imagination for what I use this Clear Plastic Speculum on my Girlfriend for! It works very well to show off all the details I like to see!
3,works fairly well,"I purchased these, mostly for curiosities sake. Some of them had cracks in them. They open up the vagina, but aren't very sturdy. Also, I had a difficult time getting it to lock in the open position, hurting myself in the process. They served their purpose, but not the best purchase."
3,Nicely packaged,"But are difficult to keep open and operate. Course they are disposable and plastic, so what is expected? But if you need a quick specula, these will do the trick."
5,Fantastic!,I have used the materials in this book for when I was in sales as well as in the classroom. It even works well with being a better parent!

5,A good overall read,"I had to read this book for my philosophy class and it really taught me a lot about existentialism. I would never have just purchased this to read it on my own, but since i did for class, and i liked it, i have kept it and review it every once in a while."
4,Informative with beautiful pictures,"Good information,like how it is organized and has some wonderful historical pictures. Some pages look like they are going to come loose & fall out soon, did expect that the pages would stay intact."
1,Bad Cheese,The cheese was old and hard tried to slice and just broke off in chunks . Bought a 2lb and it wass great wont buy again.
4,"good stuff, works fine","i dont think it really makes a difference when you talk about memory, this was the cheapest stuff, so i bought it, and it works fine. I think thats all that counts really isnt it?"
1,gold Labrador Retriever charm,"I was very surprised at how thin, small and lightweight this charm is vs. the picture. It and the other charm I purchased from the same vendor were definitely over priced for the item."
2,marc anthony live from nex york city,"je suis déue il s'agit de quelques titres extraits du concert au Madison Square Garden en 2000!! pourquoi ne pas nous offrir un ""live"" de concerts plus récents (Ténérife, Madrid Barcelone....)???? dommage......."
4,Exciting Debut Novel,"In The Collapsible World, Anne N. Marino gives us a unique voice to add to the ""coming of age"" genre. Lillie, at 24, finds that she has little control over her dysfunctional family, and in fact, little control over her own life. As Lillie struggles with her life's lessons, taking detours with alcohol, cigarettes and casual sex, she slowly learns what it is to be an adult, and just what it is adults do have control over. While the motif of invisiblility could have been brought out more, making it more ""literary"", it is still a highly accessible and enjoyable novel from this first time novelist. More than a ""beach read"" and less than high-brow literature, it is sure to envelop you in the underbelly of a young girl's San Francisco."
4,Quick Read with Strong Characters,"Anne Marino is a friend and I am pleased to be able to recommend her book. Those of you who have first-time novelist friends know how rarely this is possible :)The most interesting chapter for me was Marino's exploration of the psychology of firearms. Lillie's lover teaches her how to handle a gun and the pistol becomes a kind of emotional pointer between them.Larry, the proverbial elephant in the room, is as perfectly selfish, deceptive, and stubborn as any parent undone by their own misbehavior. He could be a gambler, an alcoholic, a philanderer, or simply an absent dad. Marino elects to develop him as a doped-up doctor and gives Larry's chapters an infotainment edge.I too had wished for something longer and for a more upbeat ending, but it was worth my Jackson to be invited into this unusual family. The members are well drawn and ought to be serialized."
3,Much too real for me...,"I read this book in 2 hours and found the plot to be extremely depressing, but still thoroughly enjoyed the author's ability to bring you into her world.Anne N. Marino has a magnificent way with words, however I would not recommend this book to anyone looking for a 'light' read."
1,Don't Buy this Battery,"This laptop replacement battery (NOT manufactured by Dell) advertised with a one-year warranty died within eight months and would not charge. The seller would not respond to questions about refund or replacement (online contact page). Five stars to Amazon, however, for providing a refund (order was fulfilled by Amazon for a third-party seller). I recently purchased a Dell replacement battery (also through Amazon) and it works fine and charges."
1,Wrong Product,I ordered a PII cpu fan. I received a P4 cpu fan.Not worth effort to return it.I will not use Amazon to purchase computer hardware anymore.
1,Not worth a 99 cent 5 day rental...,"This looks like a TV pilot gone badly wrong. The soundtrack is poor. The acting is poor. The pace is increadibly slow. The special effects are poor minus. Blue screen shots are obvious. Only one alien effect (a rubber mask, probably made for but not used in The Arrival). A few underground scenes stolen directly from ""The Arrival"". As a TV pilot, we are introduced to the two characters that will show up regularly, so of course, neither is injured. Of course, the aliens couldn't be driven away either (no reason for a series then). Full frontal nudity on one woman, not a playboy centerfold either, for 6 seconds or so. No swearing I can remember. Did I say the special effects were poor? Lead character is incredibly dumb about what is going on, increadibly psychic about alien technology. Better than BATS? Hmm..... NO, not better than BATS! ... If I could give 1/4 star, I would..."
2,"Yes, this movie is absolutely terrible...","...and we knew it would be. That's why we, the Ferncliff crew, watched it to begin with. And, needless to say, we were not disappointed, except for one tiny thing. Not enough of the alien leg bendy back effect. The bad acting, incredibly trite and idiotic plot, and the ""Why yes, I'm the brother of the main character from the first movie"" were great though. Of course this movie is bad. They couldn't even get Charlie Sheen to come back and star in it."
3,GREAT ACTING AND HOT BODS SAVES THIS FLICK!,THE WRITING IN THIS FLICK STARTS OUT FANTASTIC BUT THEN THE STORY TURNS INTO A CHASE MOVIE. AT THE END IT GETS GOOD AGAIN. THIS FLICK WOULD NOT BE WORTH WATCHING BUT FOR THE OUTSTANDING ACTING OF PATRICK MULDOON AND JANE SIBBETT. THE CHARACTERS INTERACT WITH EACH OTHER IN A VERY INTERESTING WAY. IT DON'T HURT EITHER THAT BOTH ARE VERY VERY HOT!!
2,Bad Movie !,This movie is nothing like the origanal. This movie is so low budget that there is only 1 scene with a alien. Thats it! Also If the director wanted to all he would have to do is take out the nudity scene and it could be PG or PG-13. It wasn't that bad other than that. The plot stank. Please stay away.
1,DO NOT EVEN BORROW FROM SOMEONE WHO HAS RENTED IT!!!,"""Days of Our Lives"" is a much higher quality piece of science fiction than this movie. This movie combines all the best cliches from the worst syndicated TV series (all of them), a bit of full frontal nudity, and pathetic music. Very apathy-inspiring."
1,DO NOT RENT!,"terrible film...the first was exceptionally well done....much better than I thought it would be...and I had hoped the second would be good as well. I was wrong. Terrible effects, cheesy acting, and a horrible script. I live in Canada where they filmed this thing and it's a complete embarassment! Watch the first. Avoid the second. Like most sequels, it stank"
1,Annoying Beyond Belief,"This book was inflicted on me by my college prof--ok, so I'll admit some of it was worth reading; Sven's got a bit of a point about technology taking over our lives and he writes quite eloquently about the joys of reading. Also, the last few essays about specific writers were somewhat enjoyable. But on the whole, it's stuff I've heard before in a more accessible and enjoyable fashion. Sometimes it led to some mildly interesting conversations, but basically, I feel it was a waste of my time. Sven needs to get a grip--technology isn't going away. Also, I had to chuckle when I read him boast about the fact that he is ""in no sense online."" Well, that might have been true when the essay was first published but his journal sure is online now! At any rate, if freaking out about technology taking over our lives and our society going to hell in a handbasket is your thing, you might like this book. I didn't."
2,Less than ultimate edition,"Kino's first Blu-Ray release of a Keaton film included multiple music tracks, including a piano score. In more recent releases, though (including this one) it has only offered the jarring and insipid music of Robert Israel. During live showings of Keaton films in Minneapolis I have witnessed piano scoring (the best) and creative contemporary scores by local groups. A great musical score really helps to accentuate the strengths of the film instead of calling attention to itself. Israel's work is subpar and takes away from the experience."
5,Keaton's marriage life slapstick farce,"This splendid slapstick farce was Keaton's revenge to the tensions and bitterness of the marriage life with his first wife, Nathalie Talmadge. The film is a torrent of very calculated sight-gags with a unstoppable rythm that arrives to its ""climactic"" explosion in the spectacular scene in which the character incarnated by Keaton, a wrecked lawyer who have to be married by 7 p.m. of his 27th birthday to inherit a big fortune ( this is, in 24 hours ), must choose between five hundred spiteness brides or a rocks avalanche. The film knew a very poor remake in 1998 called "" The bachelor "". Another masterwork of one of the greatest technician and comic artists of cinema.This DVD edition contains too the early Keaton's shorts : ""Neighbors"" ( 1920 ), a shakesperian underground farce and "" The balloonatic ""( 1920 )"
5,Beautiful Release - See Where it Was Filmed,You can learn about where Buster filmed scenes from Seven Chances on the visual essay I prepared for this release. You can also see some of the spots on my Amazon author blog post[...][...]
2,Same Bass Line Throughout the book,"I thought I would learn some very cool bass lines, but it was disappointing. Its mainly quarter notes in 4/4 time. The CD is awful to follow. It sounds like the same bass line with slight variations. There might be a couple bars here and there that I could use, but I got much better ideas from my piano teachers. I say invest the money in a lesson with a good pianist instead."
2,Not what I expected,"I bought this for myself, rather than a gift, to provide daily motivation and encouragement, but I found the book dull and boring. As a single mom who had a daughter at a young age, I was not able to relate to the stories which mainly centered on moms who were divorced or widowed. I think older Christian single moms (40+) with teenagers may find this more inspirational. I plan to give the book to a friend."
3,Nostalgia keeps this plane going!,"I bought this for my 3 year old daughter. Its just like the ones I played with when I was a kid, cheap and thin and breaks easily! The rubber-bands that came with it broke after about 5 flights. But had some extra at the house that fit so I used those. My daughter was interested in it for about 20 flights, in which the plane took some damage but was easily repairable. She lost interest as did I, nostalgic memories keep me going back to it though!"
3,Flying with balsa,The plane is easy to assemble and flys about as expected. It even comes with a extra rubber band. This plane works as well as I expected for the price.
1,Durability is terrible,"My daughter wanted to learn about planes, so I bought this to teach her about lift and drag. She waited for it excitedly, we built it, followed the instructions for a limited test flight, and it snapped in half on the first flight. Don't waste your money."
5,Delightful!,I just bought 2 of these and I'm very pleased with them! They are cute and I like that they come with a little salsa recipe in the box! The colors are vibrant- I love how the spoon fits in the chili pepper and that you can store the salsa in this container- I think it will be very nice for company!!
1,Nutraceutics relastyl,I purchased this product in hopes that it would do what it promised. I will not purchase again. I can get the same results using Ponds face cream.
1,defective,This switch was defective with no starter function. Really no reason to have a problem with something so common and simple.
3,OK READ,Its an Ok book about a Beaufighter and Defiant pilot during WW2. Not the best read on the subject but entertaining.
4,Frustrated w/ Public School? PRAY AND Roll up Sleeves,"I found Cheri Fuller's Book Helping Your Child Succeed in Public School to be very encouraging. There are many people out there shooting down our public school system. I feel that this author not only believes strongly in our public school system but is placing the responsibility in the hands of Christian parents. She brings out a very good point...If all christian parents choose isolation and do not get involved in their child's education, we will be in a sad state. My impression of the book is two-fold. 1 - She confirmed that I've been doing a lot of things correctly. 2 - She challenged me to be proactive with specific ways to support the system (not all come to mind if one has not been an educator). I look forward to reading her next book!"
3,ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT,"Helping Your Child Succeed in the Public School offers some encouragement and ideas for parents with school age children. The real life examples cited feel less than authentic -- as though the author got them to say what she wanted them to say. They stuck out in the text. I was also looking for a more practical, down to earth book. While praying about school is fine, there is more every day roll up your sleeves work that can be done."
1,Not worth it.,Somehow I live in one of these places and I know several others very well. I trying to move from one of the best places to raise my family. This book just didn't have the information needed to make a sound decision.
1,"Diversity, mangled","This is a dishonest book.The authors claim to have invented a `diversity measure' for each place, giving the percent odds the next person you meet on the street will be of a different ethnic origin than your own. They peg the U.S. average at 54 percent.They say, "". . . diversity makes a place a better place to live,"" and that it ""brings value in differing points of view, differing interests, and different cultures to learn from.""Now for this book's dirty little secret: By their own figures, almost all of the 100 places they feature are less diverse than America.You can't have it both ways. If you're going to piously celebrate diversity, stop steering readers away from diverse Dallas or Charlotte or Chattanooga to lily-white Flower Mound, Matthews, or Hixson."
4,Great Relocation Resource,"As just one component of your relocation research this is a great tool. While it is hard to question the underlying research presented in the book you have to look for nuances in the recommendations the authors make to gain a better understanding of a particular area. These carefully worded nuances are a critical part of gaining a true picture of the ""Best Place"" being rated.Having lived in a few of the cities rated as ""Best Places"" the subtle comments reveal a much more accurate picture of the area than the statistical data."
2,A bit disappointed.,"I thought this book would be great for brunch-style breakfast dishes as I often have overnight guests and like to have pre-made dishes in the refrigerator so that I don't spend the morning at the stove. This book, while does have what look like tasty recipes, is mostly things like eggs and pancakes and waffles, all things that need to be done at the last minute. I was so disappointed I gave it away."
4,One Pivotal Moment,"History has a tendency to make everything neat and tidy. This happened, this happened, then this happened.Experiencing history is very different. It's messy, it's uncertain, and the outcome is in doubt. This book does an excellent job of showing that Armistice Day wasn't a clean ending, and that what happened in the weeks after Nov. 11 shaped the next generation of peace and war.I agree with the commenter who felt this book was too focused on the West. Fascinating stories, such as the emergence of Poland, should get a more proportional treatment. In his defense, this is an English-speaking audience. I commend the author for doing high-quality history in a readable fashion."
3,Average history,"It appeared that the author went to great pains to research this work. However, there are too many errors attributable to sloppiness on someone's part to rely on his words. These errors are not just typos that someone missed and it calls into question many of the atuhor's observations and conclusions."
2,Consume the toxic metal mercury?,"Ok, after reading the first chapter or so, I was a bit disillusioned. It listed one of the keys to immortality to consume the insidious liquid metal known as mercury. It has been PROVEN that mercury is highly toxic to the human body. I guess Svobada is conveying you eat enough mercury to embalm yourself, I don't know. I was definitely disappointed. But I guess that is one of the rules of tantra: don't build something up only to be disappointed in it. I may not have given this book enough of a chance, since I'm really not all that far into it yet, and maybe people were simply unawares that mercury kills you. But hey, that's a pretty big warning flag right there to tell you to eat mercury."
5,Don't fear reality,"""Aghora At the left hand of God"" is a book I would surly recommend for anyone on the spiritual journey. I feel it is necessary to be open minded and trust divine intuition. The portrait of Aghori Vimalananda's life is very straight to the point, and may make one's lacking in faith a bit frightened. Or on the flip side, it may just be the divine spark needed to ignite the spirit of faith within you. If you trust, ""that still small voice within"", and your guru you will be able to gain great inspiration and perspective from this wonderful book. Anyone, who knows anything about eastern philosophy can relate and grow from Aghora. It will take you through realities not many were meant to know about, at least not until the moment of death maybe.Jai Jai Sri Sri Mata Amritandamayi!"
5,An interesting read,I have read this book of Joseph Citro and found it quite interisting. I have all of his books so far and find him a very fascinating writer. He is worth it.
4,Shiba Uno,"Pretty good for someone who doesn't know about this dog, but i PEFERsomething with alot more info..."
3,Good for a puppies...,"I just adopted a 2 year old Shiba Inu and was excited to get a book to learn more about the breed and thought this was affordable and seemed helpful. This is not to knock the book, because it is well written, but I was frustrated to find this is really more centered around puppy care and choosing a Shiba puppy instead of general breed behavior, maintenance, training, etc. althought most information wash't relavent to me, this book did offer up certain insights that were new and interesting, such as the personality differences between male and female Shibas, and the fact that you should always adopt a dog of the opposite sex if you plan on getting a playmate for your Shiba, as they can get competitive otherwise. Overall, this is great if you're thinking about adopting this breed and want info on puppy care or how to pick the perfect Shiba."
5,Shibas - all you ever wanted to know and then some!!!,"This is a great book for those just curious about the Shiba Inu or for fanciers or owners. Filled with gorgeous full color photos of Shibas, and educational information about the breed, temperment, training & behavioral issues. Great book for all purposes!"
3,Incomplete Pet Owner's Manual,The book is well written but lacks any solid substance in areas like training. If you just want to know more about the breed it will fit that nicely.
3,Its OK,The book is written mostly with basic information on all types of dogs. The first part that is actually written about Shiba Inus is geared towards those that want to show their dog. Its cheap...so I say its just OK.
3,Useful for show dog selection,"If you have not yet bought your Shiba Inu, this book is useful as it covers all the reasons for buying or not buying one, how to select a suitable breeder and how to prepare for the arrival of your new puppy. If you already have a Shiba Inu and just want to learn more about them, half the book is not useful for the reasons stated above. The rest of it has some useful information for those who want to show their dogs, but it is not of great interest to those who just want a pet. Information on care, training and health are very general which is inevitable considering the size of the book. I would recommend this book to someone considering buying a Shiba Inu and who wants some general information about them. However, I would not describe it as the ""Complete Pet Owner's Manual"" (the subtitle of the book) as it is far to general on many topics to be complete."
3,"VB only and not for beginners, quiz questions and answers.","First of all we are talking VB only, no C#. It is not a beginners book, sorry. Otherwise the book seems ok, haven't read it though!!!The book assumes that You can finish the book in a couple of days which is completely ridiculous.However I very much like the quiz questions at the end of each chapter although there are very few of them for each chapter. But then again the answers is given at the end of the book.All in all I would say that this book definitely deserves 3 stars."
3,hdnet dvd,"I was disappointed when I received this cd because it only plays on computers. It was a present and I thought I was buying something that played on a dvd player, since it was labled a dvd. I watched it with the family I gave it to, but we had to watch it on a laptop. The content of the dvd was great."
3,dissappointed,"Disappointted in this purchase, I bought this for a gift, but too embarrased to give it, I'll lets the kids play dressup with it, or just return it."
3,History vs Herstory,"This book is very well written and contains alot of valuable info on the Rosicrucians. But as you were always told, do not believe everything you read. I know for certain that the twists and turns and HUGE assumptions she makes in this book have been proven false. If you are interested in an OK history lesson and are capable of sifting threw lies and facts, then you will love this book."
1,As dry and boring as it gets.,"I read the book while preparing for my teacher certification exam. My professional training is in History and I have had my share of dry, boring books, but this one literally put me to sleep. I used to read few pages before going to bed, a sure way to cure insomnia.The textbook is just a collection of facts, dates and names. There is no cause-and-effect line in the book, not even an attempt to draw some conclusions. Instead, it reads like a statistician report. If memorizing the dry numbers is your thing, go for it. For the rest of us, who are trying to actually understand and make some sense out of the past, stay away from this book. You will get your basics in, but it will not make you think or encourage you to seek more information."
2,De Leon strikes again...,"If you've ever read anything by De Leon--master of the term ""White Supremecy""--then you know what he's capable of. And, unfortunately, his grubby little fingers were all over this book; which--again, unfortunately--is used as a college textbook. Therefore all evil in Texas leads back to one thing--the white man. Boo!That aside, it's little things that add up. Such as stating for a fact that Crockett was executed after the The Alamo fell. There is no opposition statement.That may not seem like much, but this isn't yet another history; this is a textbook, used to teach our future leaders. Any hedging of facts, no matter how subtle, should not be tolerated."
4,Exactly what one would expect.,"This is kitchen twine - the fact that it is biodegradable is an excellent selling point, but it is exactly what one would expect in kitchen twine; which is good."
2,Butchers String,"This Butchers String is fine ,but I found this at Family Dollar for a cheaper price and no shipping."
1,Made in china,"Do you really expect me to wrap my food in toxic garbage from china? Who knows what kind of disgusting earth-destroying chemicals they have used on it or how many slaves they forcefully ""employ"" in their mega-factories."
3,I bought it with my iPod in mind,"I don't like the sound quality of my iPod when it is plugged in to the stereo. It must be turned up very loud to be able hear it. As a car stereo, it works fine."
2,Below average,"I purchased this producet because my 3 year old mp3 player (that cost about twice what this one did when I purchased it) didn't have an Aux-in port. This product was a serious downgrade. Some of the mp3 CD's my old player (a Sony) was able to play without issue no longer play with this mp3 player (perhaps the disk quality is poor, slight scratches etc, since some of the disks marginally work). Also, it hasn't been displaying titles, only numbers. The dial is annoying because if you accidentally push it while adjusting the volume, you are thrown into the selection of treble, bass, etc. I do not recommend this product (lesson learned over and over: don't buy the cheapest item)."
2,Panasonic CQ-C1333U-don't buy this,i got this after long research on the web. the key pads are crampier and the system overheats and skips the tracks after 2-3 hours of play. i will be returning and getting something else
4,Very good player,"I was looking for:- Affordable price- AUX in- CD/MP3 playerThis in-dash receiver is just what I was looking for.Sound quality is just as the original player I had in my car (Toyota Corolla 2005), maybe a little better.I would summarize that it is a great buy for the price I paid ($100.00)"
4,It's the bomb,The sound is great and the fact that it plays MP3s makes it better. It has easy to use instructions for installing and wiring.The only thing I don't like is the faceplate is to brite and there is no way to dim it.
5,My wifes b'day present,"Absolutely fine product, EZ install and no-brainer to operate manually or with remote!!! 5 stars!!"
5,Excellent taste,I have had this item both in regular and hot flavors. This spread makes a great party item. You can serve it with crackers or bread. This item is highly recommended.
4,A must read for young goaltenders and their parents!,"As a parent of a goaltender, who of course wants to make it to the NHL, I found this book to be very encouraging. Every goaltender can and does have bad games. If you have the heart, you have a chance to make it."
5,Goalies: There Is Nobody Like Them In Sports!,"Some of the most fascinating characters in sports history are goaltenders. It takes, as they say, a special breed of person to be a goalie. To stand there and have very hard-rubber pucks flying at you at speeds of a 100 miles per hour, is not for the sane.....especially in eras with no mask and almost no other body protection!Dick Irvin has past goalies talk about their profession, their sport, and some of the crazy things they did and witnessed from others. This ""oral history"" book makes for fascinating reading. I'll never forget the things I read in here about the biggest flake of them all: Gilles Gratton.As the book was written in 1995, don't look for modern-day goalies in here. Many of the men profiled in this book were players from the '70s and '80s."
4,Charming!,"If I could have rated the last few chapters of this book ten stars, I would have. The only complaint I have is that now Honey is getting out more, she is losing some of her charming oddities. But still a wonderful book!!"
2,Still Too Wimpy,"Honey Huckleberry (where DID that name come from, Margaret?) has broadened her horizons a bit since ""The Fourth Steven"" but she and the other characters are still a bit too wimpy and the mysteries too weak. I got spoiled reading another of Ms. Moseley's books first. PUH-LEEZE, Resurrect Bonita Faye!!!"
4,Grinning in His Mashed Potatoes,I love mysteries that start off with a murder! This was exciting and interesting from page one. Honey and Janie are such a delightful team. Makes me think of a Texas version of Murder on the Orient Express! Nice touches of humor make this thriller a must read. I hope this team continues in many series to come.
4,Excellent survey,"This book provides an excellent survey of its topic. The physical characteristics of the fortifications are very well discussed and very well illustrated. Not only this but, just as importantly, a succinct but very good discussion is provided as to how the fortifications fit into Wellington's overall Iberian strategy (throughout the latter stages of the Iberian war) and how the fortifications enabled Wellington to achieve his obejctives. A good discussion is also provided comparing and contrasting the miliary forces involved in terms of manpower, quality of manpower and leadership (at both tactical and operational level). The only two weaknesses (and hence four instead of five star rating) was lack of discussion regarding weapons and illustrations of infantrymen and major weapons of the English, Portugese and French."
2,dodge runner for suv,"this product was not what i expected at all.theur is no trimming to fit.nothing i can do to make it fit .it looks terrible,but at least i can keep the muddy feet off my carpet."
1,Like Taking Apart a Puppy...,"Reading The Marshall Plan for Novel writing was a bit like watching someone take apart a puppy to see what makes them so cute.I purchased this on the advice of another writer. Overly structured, cookie cutter plot devices do not a great novel make. Does it work? Maybe. I don't know, I don't think I'll be able to use it. It sucked all the pleasure, joy and warmth out of writing for me. When I tried to face my current WIP the day after reading this, I was too demoralized and paranoid to type more than a few words.If for some completely unanticipated reason you have to sit down and crank out a novel (let's say they'll take apart your puppy if you don't), this book might be helpful.Definitely not for sci-fi/fantasy genre writers. It does NOT encourage speculation and imagination. I recommend Donald Maass's Writing the Breakout Novel instead. Both useful and inspirational. There are better places to find info on novel-plotting that will not make it a miserable chore."
4,Good ideas but,"First, this book is mainly about PROCESS - which is very good and practical - but also has a lot of good information on fiction writing in general.This book is for you if you're writing a story with a complex plot (such as political or technological thrillers), many storylines/subplots, and/or lots of characters. In other words, if you have a lot to keep track of, this is a good method that will keep your novel organized and on track.However, if your storyline is more straightforward, contains just one subplot or none at all, and/or focuses on just a few central characters, this method requires far too much ""record-keeping"" (or what I call ""the writing before the writing""). For these kinds of novels, I recommend the streamlined method in ""You Can Write a Novel"" by James V. Smith, Jr. instead.As I said, it's a good book, but its usefulness depends very much on the kind of novel you're trying to write."
1,"Very confusing, hard to understand","I was hoping this book could help me with writing my novel but it was very confusing and in step five it has a section called ""Sections and section sheets"" that I could not make heads or tails of.Check out pages 59 - 64 to see what I mean. If you understand what they are telling you, then buy the book. If not don'tBasicly it was a waste of my money.K Hatch"
2,"What works for Mr. Marshall, doesn't work for all","The book is well written and convincing. And I am sure that the method he describes works well for him - and for some other authors as well.However, I've tried twice to write a novel using his plan. Both times I got stuck for various reasons. Just because you have a written formula doesn't meet it works for everyone."
2,Not recommended,"This book is great if you want to write a cookie-cutter thriller/mystery/romance novel. If you actually want to write an ""original"" book, and simply need a little help getting started on your monumental opus, check out ""How To Write And Sell Your Novel... Handbook For The Beginning Novelist,"" by R. Karl Largent. Though it also refers to writing commerical fiction, I found it to give much better general advice on bridging the gap between the ideas in your head and a book that consists of tens of thousands of words."
2,A tedious book,Way too structured and formulaic. I didn't get anything out of this book except the feeling that Mr. Marshall's method stifles any creativity a potential author might have. Anyone want a used copy?
1,Great if you don't CARE!,This is a book for people who just want to write a novel for money or to say they had written one. It isn't for writers with a real passion for the story they are telling or the characters in it. It is too rigid a formula to yield great work.
5,This book has helped me write!,"I always wanted to be able to write, but when I did I didn't like the results. This book has helped me organize my thoughts and ideas and write them down in a constructive way. The book is well-written with plenty of examples. As soon as I started reading, I was writing too!"
5,A step in the right direction,"I am glad I found this material. As someone who has always enjoyed both reading and writing I was elated to find a book that outlined the process of writing a novel. It is nice to have a structured plan and an organized way of working that plan into reality. As a literary agent, Mr. Marshall provides the necessary input within ""The Marshall Plan for Novel Writing"" for a beginning writer, like myself, to focus on the important story elements in advance of placing a word on a page. Learning to focus on the novel writing process, prior to jumping into the story, I feel is critical to achieving the goal of finishing the story, and Mr. Marshall provides a framework to assist the writer in executing this process affectively. I would also suggest the workbook that Mr. Marshall wrote to accompany the material in this book."
3,Good formula...if you want to write a predictable novel,"I agree with those who state that this is a good book if you want to write romance novels and thrillers, but if you're writing a story about a meaningful experience where events just unfold and the protagonist is enriched by such events or by colorful characters, all this failure and conflict stuff is kind of silly. Following Marshall's formula, you will end up writing a Lifetime movie script.I don't much care for the kind of novels Marshall would have you write."
2,Shallow Approach to Plotting,"""The Marshall Plan"" is a cute title for a gimmick. However, the Plan is a shallow, formulaic approach to plotting that can make any genre fiction hit its marks on page counts--but that's all. If you're a mainstream writer who needs help with more weighty matters, like developing characters or finding the right point of view, forget the Marshall Plan. New writers beware: If you think you know exactly how to write a novel after reading this book, you'll find that you've still got a lot to learn."
5,"Comprehensive, Easy to Read Layout","I am an aspiring writer and Marshalls book is easy to follow and useful. It was a smart investment. With a pen, paper, that book, imagination, and a little research, you will have a novel in no time."
2,Ok,"FinallyThe order arrived late! with only two out of nine cheeses ordered.called, waited on hold and spoke to various people. The entire order should have weighed at least 5 pound with out box. The order that I got was marked as 2!Finally 3 days later got the correct order.Cheeses small and some from the rind.Could buy better at Whole Foods.Not again"
2,"Great cheese, dangerous delivery!","I would have rated the product 5 stars had it arrived in good shape, but the ice pack was completely thawed and the cheese was warm. The plastic wrapping was puffed up from the warmth. They explained that that was okay with cheese, unless it smelled of ammonia. Not nearly good enough to pay that much for. Never again!"
3,Great cheese- shipping was deceiving!!!,"The cheese was great! When I placed my order it had a different price for shipping than what I ended up paying. The shipping was about the same price as the cheese!!! When I e-mailed a complaint, they completely brushed me off!!"
1,Worst book written,"Save your money. This is one of the worst books that I have purchased and wasted my time reading. While very easy reading, this adds nothing to the investigation of the Simpson and Goldman killings.The author made a list of 101 different scenarios and copied the theory, conspiracy or theory from the one before. Don't waste your time or your money."
5,Book relays all theories to murders,This author gives in complete detail many theories to the OJ murders.Details that maybe many haven't thought of or have forgotten.Extremely well written book. I would recommend this book to all who have an interest in the OJ murder case.
3,Stunning...but,"This necklace is beautiful. Well, the pendent is anyway. The pearls really distract from the sparkle of the snowflake. In fact, I plan on removing the snowflake and putting it on a black choker, that way the crystals will really shine."
5,"It IS 5 Star, some of the VERY best 'Prez"", but...","I have only one complaint. I have all of this material on various LPs, and this IS some of the VERY best of Lester, but - here is the argument for alternate takes - there are 2, sometimes more, takes of almost all of these tunes on the LPs (and, certainly, the master tapes), so which ones do we get here? You really don't know. More than likely the 'issued' master. That's fine, if you haven't developed an affinity for a certain solo by whomever, be it Slam Stewart, or the Count, on any given 'alternate take'. Those 'alternate takes' are every bit as much a part of the history of the tracks and the artists and the music as the 'issued' versions. Other than that, most folks will LOVE this one. Most, if not all, of this is the 'Kansas City Six, or Seven' bands. 'Prez' at his very best."
1,I see ghost,"Didn't work well for me. After installation in a small conference room, I noticed a ghosting effect on the picture. CAT5e STP run was less than 30 feet. Adjusting the unit with the adjustment screw/switch did not clear the ghosting. I would recommend the Gefen extender instead. It's a bit more expensive but worth it."
3,Interesting radio bootleg,"This early Sublime Frequencies release is a highly varied, sometimes but pleasantly jarring ""mix tape"" mashup collection of cassette recordings/snippets made by Alan Bishop in 1985 of local radio in Israel and/or Palestine. While there is lots of diversity in terms of local and regional traditional and popular music from Palestine, Lebanon, Syria, Jordan, Egypt and probably further afield, as well as news snippets, radio announcements, commercials, foreign broadcasts and radio frequency static and noise from the time, I find the lack of ethics in selling radio broadcasts to be fairly odious. That being said, I bought it and love it and would probably buy subsequent volumes [insert awkward emoticon]."
5,Love it!,"I bought this item for my son, who was tired of his car getting broken into. But he found another use for it: to alert him when his dog is about to get into the kitchen trash can and make a huge mess in the kitchen. It works! The dog would wait until he knew everyone in the house was asleep and sneak into the trash...not anymore!"
1,As Seen on TV?,This is why I don't watch TV. It arrived and the alarm wouldn't turn off. This thing is awful! My kid has toys that work better than this.
4,Good,"No One is one of the really heavy nu metal bands. This is a good cd for what you pay. If you want an idea of what the album is going to be like, check out Chemical or Mindless."
5,BEST METAL ALBUM OF THE YEAR!!!,It's been over 10 years since I bought this CD and I still think it wast the best album for that year.. I can listen to it today and it holds up to anything put out since then! The people who gave this only one or two stars don't know what the hell they're talkin' about.
2,Generic nu-metal,"Not a bad band - they have some catchy tunes. Of course I couldn't name which ones - they all sound alike. I bought this album the first day it came out hoping for an original nu-metal band. What a disapointment. First off, they are not hardcore. If you want hardcore, listen to bands like Hatebreed, Will Haven, Candiria, etc.. No One is another generic nu-metal act featuring simple, down-tuned, 3-chord guitar riffs. The bass is somewhat decent, but nothing special. Their name is fitting because that is what they'll be in a couple of years - no one. They'll be forgotten under a pile of nu-metal acts that sounds just like them. The only good point is that they feature very little rap elements, not that it makes up for a boring, lackluster album."
3,Machine head ???,"Most of the songs on this cd sounds like Machine head when they were on top, but that sound gets a little boring after awhile.The few songs that are NOT Machine head is the best ones...like shedding witch has a great chorus....Listen to this album before buying....maybe you like it maybe you don't.Mika"
1,It's No Wonder NO ONE Has Ever Heard of Them,"I remember seeing these guys as the opening act for the Pledge of Allegiance Tour in 2001 and I really thought they got screwed by being pushed on stage like an hour before they were supposed to be for a ""crowd"" of less than 100 people who had shown up so far, so they were pretty much playing to an empty arena. I felt bad for them and thought Chemical sounded pretty good, so I decided to show some support for them and picked up the cd a few days later.....WHY OH WHY DID I DO THIS?!?!?! These guys are nothing but a blatant rip off of Spineshank and sound like every band that has been signed on to Roadrunner in the past 20 years. ""No One"" in this band shows the slightest bit of originality in their music style or songwriting."
5,"New Hardcore - ""No One"" Rocks!!!","Hey, well it turns out that I was a participant in the still ever-so-awesome Ozzfest craze. With Black Sabbath reuniting with Ozzy, and a top notch line-up of bands, it was amazing.One of the bands that did stand out to me, was No One, a hardrock/metal band that had all the right tunes and just enough funk left in their lyrics to keep you hooked riiiiight to the very end. I just picked a copy up recently. When I first put it in my stereo I was blown away! Songs like ""Down On Me"", ""Chemical"" and ""My Release"" are perfect for hardcorists.Grab it today!!! A necessity for Ozzfest and Nu-metal fans!"
4,Where'd These Guys Come From?!?!?!,"This cd was really surprising how good it is. I just found out about them a couple days ago and bought their cd, and it is awesome. They sound like a bunch of different metal and rock bands mixed together. Very cool songs and lyrics. I would recommend picking this cd up."
4,I liked it,"I think I'd probably do the same thing if I created a holodeck program that didn't turn out the way I wanted it to. I think the closing scene was a little goofy, I guess they're trying to keep things PG. Even so, it was different, it left me thinking."
4,That was a good one,Not your run-of-the-mill Voyager episode. It had a good story line and the last third was particularly good. It was worth seeing.
3,The ending was...,"On a side-note: It's hard to believe that the actress playing B'Elanna is 38, she barely looks 20 years old here (I think B'Elanna was cast as a 25 YO)This episode started out promising, but then the 3rd act fell flat and the ending gave no closure to anything. It's like if the Snow White movie ended while she was dying from the poisoned apple...in my opinion this episode was mediocre when it could have been something amazing. But perhaps my review is colored by the fact that I'm not a fan of EXTREMELY open-ended stories; to me they fell lazy, like the writers just ran out of steam and didn't know how to wrap it up. And usually those types of endings are obvious and foreshadowed, but here it felt so abrupt I was left dumbfounded saying ""are you serious?...that's it?""Some final words: If you are a fan of B'Elanna, you'll love it. There is a lot of her in this episode, and she does an excellent job all the way through despite the story not living up to it's start."
5,Best Star Trek series by far.,"Janeway enlivens the old tired ""Captain"" role and shows all the boys how it's supposed to be done! 5 stars all the way!"
1,CHEAP KNOCK OFF,We are collecting all the Star Trek movies and TV episodes. So I was not happy to find CHINESE subtitles on the screen.We have not watched the rest of the discs as the subtitles are very annoying. I have sent 2 messages to the seller Alektorophobia Games and have yet to receive a reply.[[ASIN:B000228EBS Star Trek Voyager - The Complete Third Season]
4,Not Too Bad...,"Many times, the third season is the ""silly season"", where Star Trek falls into the trap of ""humanizing"" their characters by throwing in comedy segments. ""Voyager didn't much as other series. Many oif the shows were very good, and worth the time and the money."
2,A missed opportunity to explore some interesting ideas,"This episode falls pretty flat---in contrast to the usual role-model behavior, Janeway's decisions are neither clever nor ethical, and the whole thing moves pretty slowly.A society with an extremely unjust and authoritarian government convicts Tom and Harry of a crime they didn't commit. Janeway plays police officer for the officials in an attempt to clear her crew, but fails to consider the ethical implications of siding with such a corrupt regieme over those ""terrorists"" who are resisting them, and ends up seeming like just a self-interested bully. Then---spoiler alert!---in the end, it abruptly somehow all works out.I've seen worse episodes, but this one definitely could be skipped."
4,VOYAGER,"I don't know about anyone else, but I think voyager was brillant. I strongly recommend buying the dvds. Although, I think season 4 and 5 were a bit more exciting. The earlier seasons kind of give you an introduction to things and set everything up. But, they all are funny, brillant, and well written. I LOVE IT!"
3,DVD sets,"This was a dvd season set.Once again,when i received the set the case was broken.I returned it for another one and that case came in broken too.I tried to return this one also,but amazon said they would send me another blank case or redeem my money.I didnt want a blank case.I wanted all my seasons of voyager to match,who wouldnt?So I took the refund.Since then i have ordered the complete series of voyager.Seven dvd box sets all coming at one time.Maybe these will be packaged better,just because of volume.We will see when they get here."
3,Start Trek Voyager Season 3,"Start Trek Voyager. Great series, almost matches the original in terms of creativity, ingenuity and vision of the makers. But the packaging is terrible. I have ordered Seasons 1, 3, 5, 6 and 7 and I am yet to get a single package in one piece. While the discs were fine, the chape, plastic holding material breaks easily and leads to major storgae issues. I hope someone couldlook into them."
2,"OK, but....","The part about the doctor was OK, but I found the rest boring. This was not one of my favorite episodes. They have lost so many of those shuttles, I don't know how they have any left."
2,Bad Disc,"I got this series in peices some seasons from retail stores and then I decided to order one of the last seasons I needed from here. I got it only to discover that one of the discs the last one in this season three in fact doesnt work. So I could not watch the season ender which was really frustrating.I paid for a paper wieght it seems.The series itself is ok enough, but its hard to get a complete view when the discs don't all work."
1,Star Trek Voyager: The Complete Third Season,The discs were wiped clean. There was nothing on any of the discs. I had already thrown away the receipt as I have always had excellent service. I didn't see any reason to keep the receipt.
3,Better stories this time,"Despite being a confirmed Star trek fan (yes I AM almost old enough to have seen them first time'round) I was never really a huge fan of the Voyager show. It seemed to lack substance and the characters seemed quite two dimensional. with the third series, that has started to change.The characters are starting to show some subtleties and we are starting to see a little more use of this in the scripts. An of course, the Borg put in an appearance as well ...In all, much better than Seasons 1 & 2, but without the real punch of Deep Space Nine or Next Generation."
2,Worst episodes ever...,"Incoherent techno-babble with two promising story-lines, both of which disappointed. This is one of the few examples of why I'm really glad they did away with Kes and brought in a non-sentimental character to replace her.And the ending made no sense, in either story line."
2,Future Sex,I never got to see the first few seasons of Voyager when it came out. I picked up about late season 5.I enjoyed those so I decided to collect the full series. Season 3 I could have done without. Everyone expects to see a little skin in a Star Trek series but the third season of Voyager was written to be a showcase for it. Laid on just a little thick I would say and without much use to the story line. Luckily it got better as the series progressed so I could let my kids watch again.
3,my review,"I followed this series on Television, but not too closely. Needless to say i found some of this series I had not ever seen. So far. I am throughly excited about the series and the character ""Captain Katherine Janeway."""
2,Very dated,"Probably a great book in the mid 1960's, this one just doesn't have much to offer the contemporary reader. I was hoping for a little more history and cultural studies, but it's largely a list of places where one can hook up in myriad ways."
4,Great French comedy,"A classic in French comedythere is no subtitles,you have to be Frenchto understand not only the language but allthe expressions from that time.I grew up with those movies and I still find this one extremely funny"
3,No way,"Ok, Ill give you this, this show might be out of print and hard to find, but you cant charge $89 for one episode. I can get it at a thrift store, or an auction for no more than $5, or $10 for the whole set. You rip people off, and I guess it works, its good for the seller, but bad for the customer."
4,english-thai keyboard,"this keyboard, although contructed a bit in a sturdy (or rather old fasioned) way with quite large buttons, is easy to connect. Plug and play no additional sofware needed. The supplier also provided very detailed, helpfull info about how to configure the pc in order to switch between languages."
5,Wow I am so surprised!!,"Wow, I was so surprised the game came so quick I was happy with that. GEEZ!! This gum is sour but WARNING: This gum is sour at first and then it runs out of flavor fast. I still say this is the best gum ever!!"
3,Bobby Vinton Fan,"If you are an avid Bobby Vinton fan like I am you will appreciate the Polish Princes' antics in this video. He sings, he dances and he plays a variety of musical instruments. It was like an extra long version of his syndicated show way back when. The disappointing part was that there were many, many other guests on the show that also contributed a big piece, taking time away from our beloved Bobby.It seemed as though he was attempting to get some new faces discovered by letting them perform. Overall, it's enjoyable if you like his variety show entertainment."
2,Difficult to understand,I didn't understand the rules of the game. My 11 year old plays his version with cousins. The card info is good. He really likes the tornado spinning piece. We've had this 6 mos and I allow him to make his own rules.
4,reading at the shore,"Beth Sherman is an intriguing writer. I loved reading a book with familiar towns like Red Bank, Asbury Park and other local towns mentioned. She also mentioned how the Fannie Farmer candy store in Red Bank is now a Starbucks coffee shop. This is the perfect beach read. Try the whole series - I know I will!"
2,Crap,"The major flaw of this game, is that if you bowl continuously on the leg side and just aim for the wickets you can EASILY bowl batsmen out, even the top teams.This is a grave, serious error and should be fixed, because if this game is based on reality then in reality if I am aware that I could get batsmen out by just bowling at their leg-side then it's not worth playing the game of cricket.The commentary is just atrocious. For starters, it's boring and some of the phrases used are recycled over and over. EA Sports also could not attain the rights to some of the teams, thus fictitious names are used for most players.This could be a great game if you play against your friend. But I don't always have a friend to play, so in conclusion, this game sucks. EA Sports will never catch up with Cricket video games and give it the respect it deserves, as they do with Madden (American Football - and yes, I have played it and it's very good), which sells more far more copies than Cricket. Big Thumbs Down."
4,Full of simple treasure,"This thin little book has so much ""food"" in it. I used it for a class and was astounded at the simplicity of it and how well Rev. Hagin articulates what use to seem so complicated to me. If you want a fast, good Godly read that you'll walk away from as a better person.... this is a book for you. I just loved it."
2,Didn't last long.,"I used this mill for awhile, maybe 5 months, before some mechanism inside of it ground to a halt. Disappointing for the price."
5,You will NOT regret,"I have bought hundreds, if not thousands, of items from Amazon, and I usually don't write reviews unless they exceed way above my expectations. Let me tell you, I was terribly disappointed with a Kraus soap dispenser as it wouldn't dispense thick or think dish soap. I bought this LDR 551 P120CP after reading reviews, but I was still skeptic about it working. It works wonderfully every time to a slight push and works with any thickness of any dish soap."
4,"Good for hand soap, but for dish soap?","(Feb 28, 2011) I purchased two of these (one for hand soap and one for dish soap). They are beautiful, easy to use and install, and they function perfectly. I installed them yesterday, so I don't know yet if they will stand the test test of time. I will update if something happens, but I thought these were a great value. No complaints.UPDATE (Jun 18, 2012) After about a year of use, the dispenser holding the dish soap had some pretty bad corroding on the inside, to the point where it developed a small hole and started leaking out the sides when you press down on it. I was able to put some water proof sealant over the hole and has been working fine now for several months. I was kinda surprised though that the hardness of dish soap would cause stainless steel to corrode that badly. So I am taking away a star from my initial 5 star rating. I would still recommend this product."
1,Half the Price at Wal-Mart,"Can't justify this price, even if shipping is free. Bought two less than 2 years ago and both failed (dispenser stem rusted and fell off both). It does look good though."
2,not so much...,It has leaked soap under the counter and now the finish on the pump handle has begun to rub off.
3,Quality so so,"We bought 2 of those, one seems to have a problem since the white liquid soap is coming out greenish. We're assuming it is corrosion, which of course should not happen !!!!! We're using green soap in the second one so we can't tell if it has the same problem."
4,Easy to install,"Wasn't much trouble putting this in. I have no idea where mechanics get the idea they should charge me about $200 for this simple repair.Seemed okay, I got a fair amount of used out of it before the car died from other reasons."
4,Provocative Analogies Prevail,"Provacative analogies prevail in Novus Ordo Seclorum. Young man seeking to shed held values, replacing them with empathetic nourishing ones. Strugled with some of reading due to gender difference but glad I read it to its conclusion."
4,One man's genesis,I wasn't sure what I was getting into with this book but it surpassed my expectations and was actually really quite interesting. It is basically the story of one man's genesis that has endured the ages as a plot device yet it appeals to a contemporary audience.
3,Caveat,"As a fellow depressive, I agree with a lot of things Lauren Slater writes about depression, and especially with her feelings of loss of creativity whilst taking medication. I experienced the same thing. I've given the book three stars because I found her writing oddly flat; and even with Prozac as a reason for this, I still found it an uninspiring read- unlike Elizabeth Wurtzel's Prozac Nation, which was so well written I could hardly read more than 10 pages at a time without having to go and do something to cheer myself up. Still, some good points are made in this book, and I wouldn't _not_ recommend it."
5,The Best of Slater,This book is my favorite Lauren Slater book if you like this one and you like other books like prozac nation or such you'll LOVE Lauren Slater. Slater is so poetic the way she talks I always underline great phrases or quotes in my Slater books. This book tells of her journey with Prozac and it tells it from a person who knows! Not only did she take Prozac she is also a doctor of psychology she talks about things that other doctors will not touch such as prozac poop-outs and having a child born under the influence of prozac. I can't wait for her new books I'm always on here looking she's really the best in this sort of book subject.
3,Not too bad,Interesting account of woman's transcendence from self-loathing to success. Not as good as Prozac Nation though.
2,A chemically-induced coming of age story.,"The transition from obsessive-compulsive disorder to a peacful life of shopping, falling in love and finding a job is told with poetry. I wanted much more, however. Slater skampers past very weighty issues with barely a nod. Perhaps the new life ""lite"" she enjoys with Prozac makes her unwilling as of yet to probe in much depth the problems and potentialities to which her remarkable experience speaks."
5,i loved it,"i loved lauren's book 'prozac diary'. i love her writing in general because she depicts her life as both beautiful and staggeringly painful. this is a difficult thing to do but writing can sometimes be a doorway out of that pain. it's very much an artform to be able to transform the pain of one's life into something useful, something that communicates and i think she does this very well. i don't believe people should be so heartless in their criticism. not every book is going to be a fit for everyone, no matter what their expectations and although not everyone can relate to this type of book i think it's hard to deny that it communicates intelligently."
2,Unimpressed,"I agree with the reviewer before me. I started this book and set it aside because there was nothing on it that has not already been told better somewhere else.I would much better recommend The Beast, by Traci Thompson, for an honest, emotional but sober account of what it means to live with depression. Believe me, I know."
3,Brief Diary,"This book was just okay. It was somewhat interesting to read about her experiences with Prozac, but she did a lot of whining about the things that it took away from her, rather than focusing on the fact that it gave her her life back. Her writing is also tangential when she tries to become poetic. Something seemed to be missing. The book felt incomplete or rushed. It is a quick, easy read, but I can't say that I would recommend it."
4,Got stuck with them,I bought a pair of these when I was passing through fry's one day because my skullcandy headphones that I had at the time had died after I stepped on them. There was a small fall in sound quality going from those headphones to this one but not terrible if you are like me and don't know much about audio.I have had a pair of these for about 2 years now and I really enjoy them. They have taken a beating and still work fine and fit comfortably. For $7 headphones they are great.
1,Garbage,This was the second Aqua Glow I received from Amazon. They both worked fine for three or four days and both times the light show quit. The manufacturer offers little assistance as well. We are stuck with the second purchase that is now in a box. Good luck
4,Simple and effective,It works well and it displays a nice changing colored rainbow as advertised. I would give a five star if it came with a clear hose to go from the pool to the device and if the water pressure were stronger for a bigger rainbow. The tubes that came with the device did not fit my pool inlets.
2,"Works, but very noisy","I received the AquaGlow Rainbow fountain yesterday. None of the provided attachments connect to any of my inground return jets, so I connected it to a garden hose. It is very noisy which takes a way any enjoyment of watching the light display."
2,not so good,"this product is just ok. here are the pros and cons. the lights on this are nice but not real bright, its nice to hook this up whenever you want to use it with the garden hose but this will not sit on the side of your pool like the picture shows it is way too heavy{it tips backwards}, the fountain looks pretty but does not have a lot of pressure with it and the connection where the hose meets leaks lots of water."
3,lesser swing,"this cd is a great edition to your collection if you're a huge shaw fan like iam, how-ever this is NOT the shaw that we have all come to love. due to pressure from brunswick he and his band are forced to play in the goodman style-which is not what he was famous for. the sweet smooth style that made shaw famous and that are present on all his hits is not here, instead he is playing in the ragged dixie style of goodman. it presents a nice display of his versatility as a player, but if you are looking for classic shaw give this a miss"
3,"Nothing New, But Still Worth A Look","We're in familiar Second World War territory here - fighting the military bureaucracy in an attempt to save refugees (a mixture of Jews, Communists, artists, writers, and other ""undesirables""), interned in a camp in southern France, before the arrival of the German forces, when those refugees will inevitably be turned over to the Germans and whatever fate has in store for them. Still, it's well done, and all the more compelling because it is based on fact. Interestingly, the film does take an unexpected (for this kind of film) turn at the end. Certainly worth a look."
1,Milles,I would have prefered if it were an English audio version - I can't rtead that sub text fast enough
1,Charger,"I ordered the charger because it didnt say that one came with it,guess what theres one with it & the charger that was an extra purchase came & doesnt look like the pictured charger & has no paperwork whatsoever? Now am I going to have to pay to return something that should have been listed as coming with product & also should not be listed in the and people often buy this when they purchase that after you hit purchase. Why ??"
1,good service,I purchased this on 3-25 and have been pleased with the delivery timing and product to date
5,Razor charger E100,The charger was new and works great. It is an exact match as original or appears to be an original charger and charges batteries fast. I bought 2 because I have 2 scooters and they both work flawlessly.Thanks.
1,Piece of junk!,"I purchased this charger after I managed to ""burn"" the original after we moved to Middle East (here we have 220V instead of 110V). My friends brought it to me few weeks ago and I tried to use with an adapter to avoid ""burning it"" again. I even took it to a local electronics shop, and they tried it for me...no luck! The charger was DOA! I haven't even tried returning it since I would pay more for shipping from Qatar to wherever it came form...so my advice: do not buys this product!"
5,Exactly what was needed.,"Not much to say here, but it was delivered quickly and was exactly what was needed as a replacement. It's a newer version than what broke, and has a better set of lights indicating when it is in use."
1,rating a charger,Its a black charger that came to me in korea and not my kids in the states for their electric scooter. So when my kids open up their presents for Christmas they will use the charger then.
3,"Rafi sang 10,000's of songs. Offer a bigger selection live.",Come on offer more selections so that more people can listen and buy and appreciate the immortal voice of the legend Mohamed Rafi. Could you recommend mohamed rafi web sites to me and also where i could get a live rafi video/s
1,WISH THERE WAS A ZERO STAR RATING,"DO NOT BUY! Safe worked first few times, but now that my daughter's possesions are in there, it will not open at all no matter we try. I don't want to have to break it open -- so if anyone has any suggestions -- please help us!"
1,"Cannot reset to own combination, but can rescue things inside","After trying two of these, we are returning the item. It is fun and sturdy, but will not reset to our own combination no matter how many tricks we try. It is very inconsistent, even with the original 0-0-0 combination.BUT... if yours locks up and won't open, all you have to do is remove the batteries. When you put them back in, you can open it with the 0-0-0 combination again. Also, you do have to wait 10 seconds between tries or it won't work at all."
1,Do not buy!,"The instuctions told us to enter the preset 3-digit number code on the combination dial, after installing the batteries, to unlock the door and reset the combination. We did that and then we could not get the vault to open with new code nor the preset code. We tried everything, ie; taking out the batteries, taking out the screws in the back to get to the reset button, and after we did everything we possibly could, it still didn't work. Went on Amazon's website and read the reviews and wish I would have read them before I bought this."
2,Figured out a little of the mystery,"I know this safe is safe, but geez it's been frustrating getting it to work! However, we did figure out a few things. If you pause on the way around to 0, it doesn't work -- You have to smoothly go from 0 (pause a moment) back around to 0 (pause a moment) and back to 0. If it doesn't work, don't try again for about 15 seconds because it shuts off. The battery thing and the reset button are still a mystery. My 6 year old is having trouble going all the way around in one movement, so now we're trying to solve the mystery of changing the code. No luck so far."

1,Great Toy -- If only it worked!,"My 8-year-old son got this toy for Christmas and loved it, but then it stopped working. The alarm would go off trying to enter the combination and it would not open. It would work the first time (or two) after letting it sit a long time, but then the problems started again. I got his stuff out and took it back. I was going to get a new one -- but not after seeing that everyone is having the same problems!"
1,Can't get it open,"My son got this for Christmas. We put batteries in and tried the default 0-0-0 combination which is supposed to open the door so you can program your own combination. Everytime we turned the knob trying to get to zero, we only got about half way when it sounded this buzzing alarm like someone was breaking into it. I wrote an email to the company to see if they have a solution. I will update if we finally get it to work."
1,Cannot Open this Safe,My daughter received this safe as a Christmas gift and we cannot open it. She has things inside and we have only been able to open it once. I join others in urging parents not to buy this toy.
1,"Sledgehammer, anyone?","OHHHHH my Go%!!! I have tried all of the abovementioned tricks to opening this dumb thing, and have ALL of the same problems. I am trying to unscrew the back of this toy to retrieve my son's ""valuables"" and I it has taken me several different screw drivers to find the right fit into the holes, a wrench, and eye glass screw driver to fit into the holes to open this friggin' toy. I have spent a minimum of 5 to 10 mins. on ONE screw driver hole. I will be here all day!!! Anyone have a sledgehammer? It would feel really good right now to whack at this toy and destroy it one good blow."
1,DO NOT BUY!,"As all the other reviews state, this toy is horrible! My daughter got this as a birthday gift. She put in a check she got from her grandparents, her wallet and all her money. She was able to open it about 2-3 times and then it never worked again. I emailed the manufacturer and got no response. Unfortunately we do not have the packaging anymore, since it was thrown away on her birthday and we did not discover the problems until a few days afterwards. I highly doubt we'll be able to get our $ back from the store (Target) that we bought it from. My advice to anyone thinking of purchasing this item is DON'T BUY IT!!!!!"
1,TAKE IT BACK,My son received this toy as a gift from a friend. It worked the first two times and only the first two times. He was lucky he hadn't put anything in it yet. He was very disappointed when he couldn't get it to work.
1,THIS IS A PIECE OF JUNK !! I WANT MY MONEY BACK,Read all the reviews here....they say exactly what I was going to say. Taking the batteries out and replacing them does nothing. Everytime we try to open the safe we get the stupid buzzing noise. It worked about 3 times and now we can't get it to open. WHAT A PIECE OF JUNK. I have emailed the manufacturer and hope to get a refund.
1,FUN FOR SHORT TIME,"I BOUGHT THIS ITEM FOR MY NEPHEW 2 YEARS AGO. HE VISITS FOR CHRISTMAS, AND OVER THE SUMMER EACH YEAR. THIS WAS THE PERFECT GIFT FOR THE PAST TWO YEARS. HE LOVED IT SO MUCH, AND WAS HAPPY THAT HE COULD HAVE A VAULT TO KEEP ITEMS IN AND BE THE ONLY ONE THAT KNOWS THE COMBO. THIS LAST WEEK HE TRIED TO GET INTO THE VAULT, AND ALL WE HEAR IS THAT DARN BUZZ TELLING US THAT IT'S WRONG. I HAVE RESET IT AT LEAST 5 TIMES, AND REPLACED ALL THE BATTERIES 3 TIMES. I AM VERY MAD THAT IT DID NOT WORK THAT LONG, AND NOW HAVE TO FIND SOME WAY TO BREAK INTO THE DARN THING W/O BREAKING THE ITEMS THAT HE PUT INTO IT. I WOULD URGE ALL PARENTS, AUNTS, UNCLES, BROTHERS, AND SISTERS.......DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS....IT WILL ONLY CAUSE PROBLEMS LATER."
2,"Kind of sloppy, low production values","Not worth $60. Most of the black & white illustrations look smudgy, and the appendix is pretty incoherent. You really have to work hard for some of the information."
5,"new scholarship, expanding the field","The review by ""a reader from New York"" would have more credibility if it were not anonymous -- why is it not signed? I've talked to a dozen scholars in the field, all have welcomed the book and emphasized its usefulness. Both as raw scholarly material and in its analysis, the book brings an artist and his delightful works out from under a shadow. The 100-page Appendix is an extraordinarily complete compendium of Koryusai's oeuvre -- Hockley's research has pushed the number of known works from about 500 to over 2500. The diacritical problem appears to be limited to a single (repeated) example. Though highly biased, I am not alone in considering the book attractively presented."
2,a worthy subject,"Hockley rightly returns to consider the place of the consumer in the market for popular prints, and it would have been beneficial if the argument had been further developed. It should have considerable impact on the field, but it is overall not as groundbreaking as has been claimed."
5,"hurry, HURRY! Fire down below!","My son loves this book. It is a very animated story with great opportunities to use hand gestures etc. to make the story riveting for your kids. There's a fun little ""side story"" and that is a little mouse you can discover on every page going through his own little drama. I think this author is a lot of fun and I ended up buying pretty much all his children's stories on Amazon. My favorite is ""Big Black Bear""."
2,Sound quality disappointing,I have very small ears and have found it impossible to exercise with the apple earbuds. These are really comfortable but unfortunately the sound quality is tinny and lacks good bass. But what good is a nice fitting earbud if the sound is bad.
1,Not very pretty.,"I was very disappointed in this piece. I am not familiar with Sajen and purchased this as a gift for a friend. The pink fiber optic glass is not as iridescent as I would have thought. The jewels look inexpensive and the overall piece looks like it could have come from the costume jewelry section. I got this on sale, and I can't imagine this being worth the regular price of $99. It looks cheap and even at 70% off, I don't think it is worth the money."
5,LOVE THEM,"these are GREAT my husband loves them, he works with them on all day and they are comfortable and easy to put on and take off and price is great, shipping was fast. If you wear knee pads you have to wear these ones !"
4,No Killer Angers - But Solid,"This book is an excellent way to read about quite possibly the bloodiest battle during the Civil War. There is no doubt that the author performed an enormous amount of research and that leads to a problem with the book. He seems to try to squeeze in so much, that at times its confusing about which side he is referring to and you never get drawn into the key battles the way you did in Killer Angels.The author, who lives deep in the south and whose great-grandfather fought for the south, is quite biased. While the northern generals might have ended the war at Antietam if they had not been so timid and cautious, whatever flaws the southern generals had that have been written about in other books are rarely mentioned here.If you are a Civil War buff and enjoy historical fiction, this is a should read but not a must read."
3,This movie has its funny moments.,"Eddie Murphy and Robert De Niro do a thoroughly enjoyable job as two buddy cops on the streets of L.A. Trey (Murphy) is the cop-in-training who wants to be a real cop...on TV of course. While De Niro plays Mitch, a tough, no-frills cop who doesn't take much off of anybody. In this hilarious comedy, two unlikely characters are thrown together to do a reality cop show. While Mitch hates the whole idea of the show, Trey can't help but be caught up in he idea of being a star.The mishaps that follow these two around are laugh-out-loud funny, and the friendship that results is a great ending to this movie. If you are either an Eddie Murphy or a Robert De Niro fan, or you just like movies about cops, this is definitely one you should see."
3,Kinda Funny- Coulda Been Better,"So you pair up Eddie Murphy and Robert De Niro and expect it to be great!!! Right? Well, it was funny, mostly. The jokes were good.DeNiro plays Lt. Mitch Preston, a good clean cop with an attitude a mile long who hates TV shows, hates partners and doesn't take crap from anyone.Murphy is a wannabe actor/unexperienced beat cop. Rene Russo brings the two together with her idea of a great new reality cop show, where camera's will follow them around and watch them solve crime. Throw in some drugs, fancy guns and pandemonium.It had a few laughs, but all in all, it just wasn't at all what I expected."
3,Half Decent Buddy-Cop flick,"I know Murphy hasn't done anything good in along time, I figured a guy like De Niro and him doing a cop movie, it had to be good.Well, it was okay to say the least.If you guys are die-hard Murphy fans, go ahead and watch but, I too was once a big fan, and I'm not all that impressed at all. The last movie he made I enjoyed was probably 'The Distinguished Gentlemen'. Good movie...As for De Niro, he has and could do better than this."
1,A Sleeper (literally),"This movie was so bad, I fell asleep watching it in the theatre. I normally like Buddy Films, but this one was just plain bad. The jokes were horrible, the acting was worse. Reality TV fits into this movie seamlessly, which is probably another reason why I didn't enjoy it. I think ""Reality"" programming is another sign of the steady decline of the entertainment business. To sum it all up, save your money, I'm sure you can find a better way to spend it."
4,"Crazy, funny and a bit wild!",This was an interesting comedy that looks at how the media can overwhelm fighting crime. Deniro and Murphy are joined together to make a action-packed crime fighting television show that follows the pair on actual crimes and investigations. Eddie Murphy was very entertaining as usual and it was fun to see Robert Deniro take his well known 'serious side' and try to loosen up. Eddie Murphy in this movie tries to play to the camera while Robert Deniro can't stand being filmed or being on television which makes for a conflicting dual which puts the fun into this movie. I was impressed with this movie and liked the appearance from William Shatner which I thought made the movie even more funny! This movie never drags and there are many laughs that await you!
5,One funny popcorn flick,"It's the chemistry between De Niro and Murphy that makes Showtime work, because it's certainly not the script or Tom Dey's uninspired directionfamiliar going-over in Showtime, an action-comedy buddy movie with Robert De Niro and Eddie Murphy as cops who form an unlikely team, chasing bad guys on the streets and fame on television."
4,"Not oscar calibur, but what do you expect with a comedy?","Ebert said that Showtime is pretty much a rehashing of buddy-cop movies. I wouldn't know because I don't usually watch those movies...but who cares?This movie was just hilarious. DeNiro and Murphy were delightful on the screen together. The contrast of their characters and the eventual evolution of their relationship was pretty interesting. If you're thirteen or older, and you like comedy, then go see it. However, even though it was kept under wraps pretty well, there is quite a bit of violence in this movie that may frighten small children. Besides that, enjoy. =)"
1,Hollywood thinks we're morons.,"This movie stinks.It's gratingly obnoxious. It's a satire of Hollywood's bloated buddy cop flick which amounts to being nothing more than a bloated buddy cop flick. It comes complete with ... car chases, zing-less one-liners, clichéd characterizations and one of the worst scripts since Battlefield Earth....P>There is one great innovation in this film. The ... montage I've seen in any movie. Ever. It reminded me of Albert Brooks saying, ""Now we'll show the French the meaning of the word montage!"" in ""Real Life."" It just went on and on and on. The garbage that was shuffled around in the montage was so unfunny that it could have been tacked on with the rest of the laugh-free outtakes at the end of the film.Go see this film if you've been needing an excuse to groan in unison with strangers."
2,Average Comedy ! For Eddy Murphy fans mostly !,"If you are a fan of Eddy Murphy, you will simply love this one too.The story is kind of you have seen it in numerous movies before and Murphy is just too previsible in his jokes.DeNiro is alright as usual but well ! He was funnier in Meet My Parents.There is not much to say about it. I will just add that the beginning is maybe the funniest part ! and it's a pity that Murphy role become too serious at the end !"
5,You just gotta let go and enjoy the silliness.,"What an unlikely crime stopping duo, when Eddie Murphy and Robert DeNiro hook up as the fated partners of a new real time cop drama titled ""Showtime"". Murphy, who is an aspiring actor as well as a Los Angeles police officer is Mr. Personality for the cameras, while DeNiro with his deadpan sentences and facial expressions plays a perfect opposite. A veteran detective, he finds all of the hoopla taxing and detrimental to the job he has to do.This movie is pure fun. We aren't talking academy award nominations here, the value is in the entertainment as well as the never ending one liners that just keep on coming from start to finish. Kelsana 3/23/02"
3,"It could be better , but ...","It could be better , but ... it wasn't ?! With all my respect to Robert DeNiro and Eddie Murphy...just o'key ?!So Mr. DeNiro playing the good and lifesmart COP . Eddie - young and unexperienced policeman , who is dreaming to become an actor . So reality TV showpeople put them together , as partners , and started making the SHOW ... Could be very funny movie , but it did not work well this time . I still had a good time , while I watched it ... but I know , that such exellent actors had much better potentional ... just had to stay with the script !? Not there fault ! BUT movie is still fine , I just expected much more ."
2,"High expectations, Low output","The actors are there, the idea is fine but it just doesn't come off like one may expect.Eddie Murphy and Robert De Niro combined would make any cop flick fan happy, but in this case the story line is so weak, with Murphy as a showtime acting wannabe and De Niro lazing his way through the movie as a an undefined policeman ceramic hobbyist the whole thing is lost.There are a couple of OK moments, but in the main ""Showtime is No Time""!"
4,Light & funny...,"That's how I will describe this film.Eddie Murphy was his usual loud, talkative (sometimes irritating) self which reminded me of that donkey in Shrek & that dragon-cum-lizard in Mulan. However, he provided the comic relief while Robert de Niro was his usual serious & intense character. As a matter of fact, it would seem surreal to see De Niro goofing around, so his 'no nonsense' character was just typically him, contrary to what other viewers say.It's light... it's funny...it's a spoof of all those reality shows we see on tv. Simply sit back & enjoy."
2,Showtime,"Robert DeNiro use to be untouchable. He would crank out so many classics in the 70's, 80's, and early 90's. Today his films have been mostly flops rather then classics and nothing can touch his glory days. Now, add anther falling star in Eddie Murphy. He has had mega success in Shreik and Dream Girlz but he seems to make a good film and follow it up by making three bad films in a row. This brings us to the film Showtime. If this movie was filmed in the 80's it might be freshier and funnier. However, today this movie comes out as predictable and stale. DeNiro does his usual curmudgeon shtick with the usual facial expressions and Murphy still tries to act like he's the funniest man alive. The movie is alright but nothing i'd go out of my way for but its alright to watch if your just sitting around and have nothing better to do."
3,Unlikely Partners,"I would've never put Eddie Murphy and Robert DeNiro together as police partners, but somehow it worked in this comedic film. Murphy's character plays a cop who so badly wants to be an actor, and DeNiro's character plays a cop who is completely disgusted by reality shows with cops on them. He's also a no nonsense cop who will go way out of his way to make sure people are put in jail, and he's not afraid to tell elementary school kids this either. After an incident with DeNiro, the captain makes him go on a cop reality show to relieve some tension. Murphy's character is over the top, and DeNiro's character is disgruntled but funny. I felt the chemistry of the two onscreen. However, the movie started off as a quirky reality show that gets mixed up in real cop business, but it takes too long. There are scenes towards the end of the movie that last too long. The movie was cool for what it was, but I wished it would've ended soon."
2,Every De Niro comedy gets worse,"... With every subsequent comedy De Niro has made, I've gone to the theatre to have my hopes dashed again and again. With Showtime, De Niro has hit a new low, and I am just about ready to give up on him.The biggest problem with this movie is the complete lack of focus. The movie could have worked as a parody of reality TV and various other cop genre. It could have worked as a Hollywood cop thriller with the quintessential wise-cracking rookie paired with the hard-bitten older detective. It could have been a Naked Gun joke-a-second comedy. Instead, it's a little bit of all three, and it ends up being not good at anything in particular.The most interesting character in this movie are Vargus, the criminal, and Powder, the dog. De Niro and Murphy phone in their performances. I know there's a great actor and a great comedy somewhere in De Niro, but I'm getting tired waiting for him to get his act together."
5,Good book,"I ordered this from the library (twice!) and finally just bought a copy myself. Although a little dated, it is a great information and motivational tool. I especially like the specific mileage graphs, depending on what you are training for."
2,Title a misnomer - Includes states West of Missisippi as well!,"This is a great series, but it screwed up my vacation big time when I grabbed the ""Western Edition"" for a trip to Minnesota, Iowa, and Missouri, only to find that these are actually in this, the Eastern Edition, as are Arkansas and Louisiana.Ideally, I would give this book five stars for the info it contains (heck - ten! It's as good as everyone says it is) but zero stars for the copy editor, publisher, and whoever else that allowed such a basic, major error through."
1,Poor Attempt by Good Author,"John Stott is one of my favorite authors. He is a respected theologan and commentator. John Stott's book The Cross of Christ is a classic book.Unfortunately, this book falls far short of the theological rigor one expects of John Stott. He takes a complex theological and scriptural issue and treats it in simplistic terms, without giving adequate coverage of the issue.This book is a sad disappointment. It is hardly worth reading and is definitely not worth purchasing."
1,another sad case of satan quoting scripture,"God's principal teachings of love and compassion are ignored in this decidedly un-christian book. It promotes the mistaken attitude that homosexuals are a problem to be fixed, instead of individuals created in God's image, like all human beings. God asks us to open up the doors to understanding, and said that His Path is for all people wiling to open their hearts to Him.Dr. Stott uses the scriptures to justify his own ignorance, which happens all to frequently. His so-called ""Christian"" perspective misleads true Christians who want to witness God's love to others, not their own intolerance."
5,"Gracious, solidly Biblical, concise, and readable","I just read Stott's work on same sex unions. In the middle of all of the foggy vocabulary and doctrine that is being created these days around this issue, Stott has done a wonderful job of cutting through that fog like a powerful lighthouse, showing the way for individuals and churches so that they will not crash upon the rocks of falsehood. It is important to remember that heresy sounds wise, otherwise no one would succumb to it (2 Cor. 11:13-15; 1 Tim. 4:1-2; Eph. 4:14-15; Col. 2:23). Stott has truely done his work as a Pastor and a teacher in the wider body of Christ (Eph. 4:11-16). I highly recommend this book to anyone, whether they are struggling with this issue, know someone who is, or are just in need of a short, but solid Biblical exposition on the subject. It would be great supplimental reading for a Bible college or seminary class in contemporary issues."
5,Safe and Sound,"DJ Qick, is very talented and my brother from the West Coast. I have respect for this brotha. He is a veryy creative person and would love to work with my brother in going differnt avenue and us promoting a postive image about our life style. Bro you are the the best on rocking the mic. When we meet again the world belongs to us. Love you bro."
5,classic,"I remember the first time I heard dollars and sense I was instantly hooked. Not many people give dj quik credit but I would have to put this in the top three best rap cd's of all time. I grew up with this cd, and with the crap they put out today its good to still hear this cd when I need to remember how good mid 90's rap was...........quik is the man"
5,Quik's The Name!,"DJ Quik's 1995 album, Safe & Sound, is probably the most classic gangsta rap album ever. Probably the most classic album, ever. We all know the classic hit ""Dollaz & Sense"" but including other classic songs like ""Safe & Sound"" ""The Ho In You"" and ""Can I Eat It?"" Every song on this album is great, so there is no reason to skip tracks. If I could, I would give this album 100 stars. DJ Quik is both an underated producer, and an underated MC. 5 Stars, go cop this album [along with Quik Is The Name, Rythm-Al-Ism, and all of rest of his albums.]"
5,phenomenon,dj quik is the king of funk. his beats are second to none?!? if this album is 5 stars (in my opinion) then 'rhythmalism' the follow up album is 5 and a half. so get that as well
5,This tape is the definition of the West Coast sound.,"This is by far the best Quik tape out.Homeboy really knows watts up in L.A.,cause these streets is real."
5,i love this cd,"quik gives props to the p funk which this whole cd is dedicated to the p-funk and even features p funk legends gary shider and bernie worrell on here and yes the p funk sampling frenzy continues on here but beside that this is a good cd quik talks to the honeys on several tracks like what's your fantasy and 4 tha ho in you featuring hi c, and second to none that was tight and he dissed mc eiht too hard on dollars and sense. summer breeze was so funky and make you think of the summers of way back."
5,Masterpiece,"Flow, beats and rhymes comes together as tight as gloves.This is one of the best West Coast albums in the history."
5,A classic,"This album is of the same class as Dr. Dre's The Chronic (maybe not in sales), and in my opinion even better musically. It is hands down Quik's best album he's ever done and probably will ever do. It is rare to find a rap album where you can listen to every song, most only have five out of ten. There is no filler, even the short songs you wish were longer. There is real music here, not just rap beats and gangster talk. You could put this CD in the R&B section because it is more pleasurable to the ear than most rap albums. Its not harsh at all. Its #1 in my rap collection without a doubt."
3,Micro motor,"With this motor you have to be more careful with it than the stock mini t motor. This motor will give you a little more speed but it gets very, very hot. This motor will actually burn the wires to the brushes. You can not drive a full run time at full throttle or you will cause damage. Also the brushes are exposed so becareful where you drive it. This motor is only good for street due to its high speed but for dirt track racing stick with the stock motor in the mini t because it will give you more torqe to power through dirt, also it is a closed motor to keep dirt away from the brushes."
4,Practical Circuit Info,"Haven't finished reading it, but so far appears to have practical info that you likely won't learn in school untill you get some experience in the field."
5,great subs!!!!!!,sony makes great products i have a set of these subs in 12 inch and i love them they sound great hit hard and handle power very well highly recommend the 10 are just as good and hit just as hard in the right box better than over rated kicker and way cheaper .
3,Great headphones,"I ordered these headphones for myself because I cannot stand the earbud type, but I needed something compact for use with my Nano. These are pretty good. Good sound quality, but the little foam covers come off easily and after a little while they start to pinch the backs of my ears. Despite these shortcomings, I haven't replaced them yet because I can't find anything any better."
1,thinkpad memory,"recieved it! but it did not work, laptop wood not reckignise it..... so im out the money!!!"
1,Great sound terrible editing.,"I'm a huge Europe fan and I loved the CD version of this show. I was horrified on the editing of this DVD. It's some of the worst cinematography I have ever seen. It's so bad, you can't even enjoy it without getting a headache. Lot's of useless effects and grain, out of focus areas, camera all over he place to give you a headache and they even went as far as using stretcho vision for an effect. WTF!! The camera men and who ever edited this DVD needs to be shot. I felt like I was watching a bad MTV video instead of a live concert. You know, I would of like to had the camera stay still or focused long to watch a guitar solo."
2,"""Sirius""ly Flawed","The suction cup mount is plastic with a steel bolt through it. The tension of steel on plastic quickly caused the plastic to crack and crumble apart. I had to drill holes in it and use a zip-tie to secure it. The unit started to heat up after a couple months and eventually started showing an ""invalid channel"" message and quit working. I called the tech support number in the enclosed booklet, and Sirius will be sending me a new one with reimbursment in the form of free service to cover shipping costs. ( I have to mail the defective unit to them.) If you have this problem TELL THEM YOURS OVERHEATS! They take this seriously because it is a dangerous trait of this unit. Sirius is wonderful, but this unit will ruin what should be a beautiful experience. The one saving grace is the customer support. (Is this an indicator of Sirius being aware of the poor quality of this product?)"
2,agree with several others,"My Starmate had some of the same problems other people noted. First, the plastic on the suction cup mount broke in several places and the mount would no longer hold the receiver up off the dash. Recently I began having problems with losing power to the receiver every time I hit a minor bump (and since I live in a rural area on a dirt road this is major). This did not happen early on -- something has deteriorated. Sometimes it even just shuts off when it's sitting in the home docking station, without provocation. Mine is still under warranty so I could probably get it fixed for free, but I think I'm going to try another receiver instead."
1,Terrible product,This is not worth the money. Please do not buy this just to be disappointed. It does not go on smoothly no matter what you do. Spend a little extra money and buy the hard anti glare products the sit over the screen.
1,What's with this?,"Kensington 55714 Cling2 Laptop Screen Protector 15.4 inch - notebook screen protector - SingleOver 5 years buying stuff on the internet and you have to get a dud once in awhile!This product arrived with virtually dried up application chemical cleanersand surface prep stuff. All they did was cloud up my screen and the protector film, fortunately; I was able to clean it off my laptop screen, but there were some anxious moments while I tried!I advised the seller that he may have acquired some old/outdated stock and suggested they check it out?All in all, not a recommended item."
1,AVOID!!!! Maybe the worst ripoff I have ever had in buying online,"This is a disgrace. It's a single piece of thin transparent material that has to be cut to fit and could not have cost even 3 cents. It is very hard to install and leaves bubbles all over the screen no matter how hard you try to smooth them out. It is about as useful as placing Sara wrap over the screen display. It comes with a few ineffective small packets of cleaner fluid and a bubble scraper/press that is small, flimsy and essentially useless. It has no design -- it's something one can probably but at a Staples store in units of a dozen for $5 -- it in no way is a ""skin,""This is consumer fraud."
3,OK as a glare reducer...not great however,"If you are looking for a sheet to significantly reduce glare, this does ok...not great my any means."
3,Meh,"I would have given it 2 & 1/2 stars if I could, but I decided to err on the side of generosity. The product doesn't totally suck, but it's not the best thing I've ever spent my money on.What's up with the packets of ""cleaner"" always being dried out? I think Kensington could spare a few extra cents and either add more cleaner to the packets or provide a moist towelette-type of pre-cleaner.Overall, the product does what it is supposed to do. I suggest you shop around for the best possible price because the amount that some retailers are charging (yes, that includes you, Amazon.com) is a royal screw job. It's NOT worth $20+ a pop, that's for sure."
3,screen protector,"IT'S O.K. BUT NOT WHAT I EXSPECTED. IT MAKES THE SCREEN LOOK DIM AND DISTORTED..OH,WELL"
1,DONT BUY IF U HAVE A DELL1545 INSPIRON,"This product was a complete waste of money. My laptop is a 15.6 and this product is designed for a 15.4 but this wasnt my problem. Its fit was more suitable for a full screen and this product REQUIRES YOU TO CUT TO SIZE. This presents a big problem as you can imagine when dealing with skins, if a small particle gets between the skin and your computer screen in the process of cutting down to size it looks like a giant hair you cant remove and a small air pocket surrounds that really small hair you cant get rid of because of that damn hair. Ive dealt with skins with my PSP and never had a problem with them because theirs no cutting required. Do your pockets a big favor, DONT COME OUTTA THEM FOR THIS PRODUCT!"
5,Best SFU album so far,"This has instantly become my favourite sfu album i own. Eash song is different and instantly catchy. i love the stoner death metal vibe. Chris's vocal are awsome with him trying some different stuff than usual like on the song ""13"" and Deathklaat. By way Deathklaat should get an award for using almost every cheesey evil reference in metal in only the first 4 lines! It is laughably wicked!Awsome guitars, solos and drums, cant recommend enough."
2,not that good,"This cd is flat out BORING. I thought that i would like this since someone told me that they got more brutal and more technical, but alas sfu falls short of that goal. The songs feel rushed like they were just thrown together in an hour or two and the whole cd was written in a day, basically its like listening to an entire album of filler tracks, yeah its preatty lame. The production is bad, real bad. The vocals are weak, and everything sounds so muffled that you cannot really hear everything thats going on.The point is there are tons of bands who put sfu to shame, bands like, beheaded, disavowed, vile, severe torture, drawn and quartered, and insision are all better then these guys. Actually if you want really brutal down-tuned death metal then i have two words for you vomit f^&%ing remnants! They are sooooooooo good. Yeah vomit remnants s%^ts all over this."
3,Six Feet Under - 13,"you know i dont know what to title a review i mean wtf? but anyways 13 is my first Six Feet Under cd and i really really enjoy it. The only things i dont like is that the Chris Barnes voice can get annoying at times, and the lyrics are pretty corny, but hey thats Death Metal to the core for ya. And One song *Deathklaat* i REALLY did not like at all which is why i gave it 3 stars cuz judge me all you want I am a Christian and im strong to what i believe in and hearing what he was singing was like a shot in the heart for me, i really think it was unessecary it go that far with it. But other than that song I really like this cd. Good Death Metal"
4,Pure death metal,"This album is in your face the entire way through. Decomposition of the Human Race begins with an ominous sound and soon picks speed and never lets up. As much as I like Chris Barnes, the production on this album wasn't very good in some places. I had trouble hearing the vocals over the music in some songs. But that is a very small downside to the album. Overall, the music was face-melting and the vocals were done as only Chris Barnes can do them (just plain SICK!). Enjoy, metalheads!"
1,6FU is the joke of the death scene.,"Go buy the new Behemoth or Amon Amarth , 6FU has been the only Death metal band Ive never could get into, even Cannibal Corpse and Deicide had a few songs that I liked and I really hate both of those bands. Forget this crap and go buy the new SYL, now thats some great metal. Buy anything but this. Dying Fetus, Morbid Angel or even the god awful Suffocation are better than this. To get the best just go buy an Obituary or Death album. Chris Barnes should just go smoke himself six feet under."
4,Heart of Snarkness,"I thoroughly enjoyed the pitch-black humor of this book, which flips a verbal bird at everything from mental healthcare professionals to white trash to the arrogant wealthy. At times, the snarky attitude verges on overwhelming, but read in several moderately sized portions rather than wolfed down in one sitting, The Concrete Sky is as pitilessly/pleasurably sharp-tongued as Robert Schimmel's stand-up routines or Gore Vidal on one of his more misanthropic days. The noir-tinted plot keeps fingers turning pages fast, but it's Moore's singularly pissy narrative voice that leaves the deeper papercuts...on your brain."
2,Relentless bad attitude,"While well-crafted in terms of the prose, the main character of this novel, Chad, is one of the most unlikable protagonists I've come across in years. His attitude is so snide and condescending that I had trouble rooting for him or caring about what happened to him in the end. (And the end, by the way is also a disappointment -- the book is nicely plotted until it totally skids out in the last 50 pages or so). I'm in my late 20s and I think Chad is the kind of character that gives 'twentysomethings' a bad name; he's relentlessly cynical and critical of everything around him. I don't mind some campiness or bitchiness in a character, but this book is just ceaselessly mean and unpleasant. Had it not already been taken by a classic, THE MISANTHROPE would have been a great alternate title for this one."
2,Was just so-so,This wasn't a bad book just several times throughout the text I find my attention drifting and I had to struggle to finish the book. The romance seemed a bit forced and rushed. Also the evil brother made me think melodrama! I guess that was what the author was seeking but for me it just made me wince when I read his sections. Not sure if I would read more by the author. Maybe.
1,Are you mental?!,"Okay so the newest hot place to meet attractive gay men is a MENTAL HOSPITAL?! I don't care how cute he is there are bound to be some issues there, and ones I would prefer not to know about -- everything about this book is unbelievable. It is obvious that Moore considers himself to be witty, and thought provoking -- I don't, and I don't see how anyone else does. This book was transparent, and cliche to the point where I could guess what was going to happen on the next page. Should Mr Moore make another attempt at writing, I do hope he offers us something a little better, this book belonged in the litter box."
5,"Ignore the ""Ugly Art"" Comments.","Although the art isn't your typical fluffy art, it is by no means ugly or unattractive. I think the people reviewing this comic have spent too much time eating sugar-coated candy and reading over-decorated comics. Calling Tamura's art anything short of ""amazing"" is insulting and inaccurate.Also keep in mind that this comic was made several years ago, meaning there's a generational gap in artistic trends. The art style is raw, skillful, and radiates the epic tone of this series. I hope to see the rest come out here in the US. The story is great and not a single volume falls flat, not even up to volume 27.If you want a story that hits you deep in the heart, BASARA is for you. There is deep social, romantic, political, and even spiritual commentary and meaning in this comic. It is a masterpiece and truly exceeds the medium it is written in."
2,Frommer's Benelux bombs!,"I used this guide book during a recent trip to the Benelux region of Europe. I found the book useful in helping me pick out good restaurants. It also listed the major sites I wanted to see. I did not find the book useful in reserving hotels and describing each site. I especially found the maps to be of poor quality. Many of them mislabeled the location of sites and failed to include important street names that would make it easier to find sites, restaurants, and accomodations. As a frequent traveler, I rely on good maps in guidebooks to get around cities that are unknown to me. Frommer's got me to take wrong turns repeatedly.Unfortunately, there do not seem to be many books out there covering exclusively the Benelux region of Europe. At least I did not find any that I liked, so Frommer's was the best choice among many bad choices."
4,interesting caramel cheese,"I saw this in the grocery cheese aisle and having always wanted to experience the so-called caramel flavor I bought it. Yes, this definitly has a caramel flavor, and does seem to melt in your mouth. However, on the aftertaste it has the similar texture of powdered cheese.Very good, nice for a sweet snack, and you can think of a variety of interesting flavor combinations with this cheese. Gjetost cheesecake?"
3,missing dvd?,The Package Was Recieved On Time...It Was A Gift And The Four Seasons Dvd Was Missing...Not Too Happy About That...
2,Not Good,"Baby Einstein is much better! The only CD which is good is the one with fav. kids songs... the rest have beautiful images, but they are boring for toddlers."
3,Decent Cream,"Decent Shave cream, a little oily when first applying it. Use sparingly-- if you dampen it will not foam just ""lather"" in the traditional way. I use a brush most days, so the application is worked into the skin. Leaves almost no residue. The scent is not overpowering as with some other newer brands."
3,"Good, but not great","Good shaving cream, but certainly not in the league of the Geo F Trumper products. The consistency is too light and the foam it produces with a shaving brush is only acceptable."
5,"At last, a shaving cream that works!","This is the best shaving cream I have ever used. I got hooked on it about a year ago and cannot go back. While the price is high for shaving cream, if you want the perfect shave, it's well worth it. Excellent product!"
4,Great product in quality,"While I was a bit confused, thinking I was supposed to have been getting shave oil, this shave cream works excellent, is easy to apply, and has a large volume to last. I have to shave every day and so product is great for me."
5,"great shave, great gift","I bought the art of shaving kit for my husband one Father's day and he has been hooked to the products since! This is a great item to gift to any man, shaving will never be the same without it. My husband also loves the shaving oil!"
2,Shaving experience,My shaves using this product are somewhat of a disappointment. Difficult to work up a lather and somewhat messy unless you use a brush which then creates extreme stress on the brush due to hardness of the cream. In my opinion product is also overpriced.
1,Not very good,Shaving cream has a nice scent but that is where the good ends. Does not lather well and as others have said - is very clumpy. No matter how much you work it with a brush pieces - sometimes quite large - will not dissolve/lather up so you end up clogging the blade and getting a mediocre shave. Going back to Taylors
2,Parabens,So I was using this shaving cream and absolutely loved it. It lathers well and smells good but I recently found out that it is not paraben free. For those who dont know what parabens are can look it up here [...]I would like to be on the safe side.
2,It works but has problems,"I bought this for overseas travel not wanting to carry aerosol shaving cream and wanting to keep my total luggage weight as light as possible.Well, I found that it covers well enough and protects skin better than mere water. However, it comes off so gooey and greasy on the razor than the razor gets gummed up very quickly. You have to rinse very vigorously to clean the razor for the next shaving motion. [I was in a water shortage area so it was even more taxing.] Soon, I had to buy some local version of a Gillette aerosol to make shaving reasonable again. I cannot advise whether this product is better or worse than other non- aerosol shave creams. Yes, it weighs less, can get through TSA if you carry-on, but you need great patience during the shaving process."
5,"Great Lather, Intoxicating scent!","After recently updating my shaving brush set after 23 years of excellent service, I was introduced to The Art of Shaving line and visited one of the new stores that opened up near my home. There were several brands I was considering including the very well known Floris of London line of shaving products and figured to give this American brand a try.From the packaging down to the effectiveness of the product they are simply First Rate! This jar is estimated to last from 4 to 6 months, and only a small dab is needed on the brush to create a rich, full lather that gives a smooth coating on your face which helps the blade slide smoothly and lessens the chance of nicks or cuts. The mild fragrance is very pleasing and in my opinion intoxicating, I simply am enjoying this cream."
5,Art of Shaving,One of the best products that I have ever used for getting a clean close shave. I have been using it for over 14 years and I will continue to use it.
4,Solid performer,"As always, The Art of Shaving makes a great product. The sandalwood scent is the right balance between subtle and notable, and the shave produced is close, clean, smooth, and refreshing. If you have a chance to try traditional wetshaving, I highly recommend using this shave cream."
3,Would love this even more if they shipped the right size,"I've been using the Art of Shaving products for quite a while. Nothing really compares to the quality of shave you get when you use these products - at least not shaving products you would buy at a mass merchandiser. However, Angela's Beauty Supply shipped me a 2.5 oz tube instead of the 5 oz jar I purchased. Boooo... now begins the tedious process of return-exchange."
3,"Not bad, but not worth the extra cost","For the past few years I have used Taylor of Old Bond Street (ToBS), a Mach 3 razor, after shave lotion (everyman jack currently) and had pretty good success. Decided I wanted to try something new that might perform better when my blade was near its end of life. Read reviews and decided to try The Art of Shaving for sensitive skin.I have been using this for a couple months now, through a couple blade cycles and I get the same results with this as with ToBS. Have also tried Vulfix cream with comparable results. Might try classicshaving brand to see if it is any better. My next step is to upgrade to the world of DE razors so I may revisit TAoS cream when I try that.Bottom line is that I get the same or better performance from ToBS for several dollars cheaper per container."
2,It breaks one of my major rules.,"As soft shaving creams go, I have only one problem with this product, but it's one I consider a BIG problem. It leaves a strong residue on everything. I used it for straight razor shaving, and double edge shaving both in and out of the shower. I loved the sandalwood (I'm always on the lookout for the best sandalwood shave), but it left my brush, razor, and bowl all caked with heavy residue from just a couple shaves. Before I go any further, I am militant about rinsing, so that wasn't a cause. Any residue that doesn't wipe right off is a huge problem in my book."
2,Leaves my face ultra dry...AOS creams are not for me,"I've used this and the Lavender and I just can't get with it. My face just eats this stuff up like a sponge no matter how much water I splash on my face. It's not slick no matter how much water I mix or cream I use. I tried for a month and also with the Lavender, got the worst shaves I could possibly get. This got 2 stars from me however because the scent is my favorite scent of any shave product. If you have to have a sandalwood scented shave product, look towards their soap because it's triple milled tallowed soap and does a completely better job shaving than any of their creams."
2,Blood bath,"This didn't work as well as I thought it would. I cut myself a lot which almost never happens with the ""generic"" Barbasol shaving cream I normally use yet I still had hair in a few places that for some reason the razor didn't quite pick up. It took much longer than necessary to apply the cream and I realized after 3 uses this just wasn't for me. The cream residue also builds up in the sink and can clog the drain much easier than the regular shaving cream."
2,Changed formula? Bad batch?,"I've been using AOS for a while now, but any of the Unscented tubs I get from Amazon, smell really bad; like gasoline and woodsmoke. Just from here at Amazon, fine from anywhere else.Perhaps it's just a coincidence, but after two returns I'm done trying from here and possibly with the brand all together, since I can't isolate the problem."
2,Not that great,I've used it a couple of times and I'm not very impressed. This stuff actually burns my lips!!!! At first I thought it was my new aftershave but it's this shave cream... and it says it's for sensitive skin!! I think I'm going to stick with Edge Gel.
2,Expensive for The Number of Shaves It Provides,"Comparing the number of shaves using this product to something like a Gillete Gel, I am just not seeing the value here. I did not like using the product any better than a gel, and it appears to cost six times the price. I have a quality shaving cup and badger brush from ""The Art of Shaving"". This product did not produce the magnificent shaving experience I was expecting. That's the bottom line."
4,Useful working blues vocabulary,I bought 101 must-know Blues Licks because I have several of Wolf's books and I trust him for quality and taste. I was not disappointed. Everyone of these is a useful little tool that will deliver for you if you just nurture and finesse the lick putting your own 'mojo' on it. A great buy for a good vocabulary of Blues licks. Sure a bunch of these are familiar. It's the blues! But isn't that the point? familiar gives you quick racall in a jam and variations on it give you freedom since you're going to put your own thing into it anyway. I'm always happy after finishing one of Wolf's books.
5,101 Must-Know Blues Licks (Tab Book & CD),"I like it,the book and the CD are ideal to learn the language of several styles of blues.The book can help me to play guitar improvising."
3,Good for Starters,"Needs an instructional DVD, with a larger variety of blues licks. It also meeds to be organized better."
5,I highly recommend this book for those who want a flavor of what war is about,"Hammer's Slammers Volume 1 of 3(2006)Volume One of this three volume set includes:Introduction by Gene WolfeForeword by David Drake1.

Mine wanted it for a ""decorator book"".I highly recommend this book for those who want a flavor of what war is about. Now if they could only add the sense of smell.Gunner June, 2010."
5,One of his most underrated albums,"When he came out with this album, the style fit the era in which it came out in. This album is highly under rated and possibly had the least promotion out of all his albums.The highlights of the album are:Mo Pussy-Has some funky guitar riffs.Way 2 FunkyJus Lyke Compton-Tells it like a story over the cities he went toQuik'z Groove II-Kickin it, smoke some bud type instrumental.Me Wanna Rip Your Girl-A funny, reggae jam."
5,Great book for getting results fast!,"I found this book and DVD an excellent combination to expedite the learning process of a foreign language. You will get better, faster results. I would definitely include it on your list if you are serious about learning Italian fast."
2,don't buy unless you have the homesight wireless easy start kit,"I bought this camera, however if you don't have the homesight wireless easy start kit, which motorola discontinued and sold to Xanboo, then I would pass on this camera, because you won't be able to use it without the software."
1,Cost too much...,I didn't do my research you need to use a base unit for this and it costs like a $100 you can get a similar system for $49 at ecost. Sorry Motorola you make great stuff but you failed to become the Sony here of electronics. $189 for a non weather proof system is too expensive.
4,"Nice picture, motion sensor screwy, range not that great gets fuzzy","The motion sensor is screwy and captures ""events"" every 5 minutes when there is clearly nothing around to stimulate it. Product line is being D/Ced, HOWEVER overall it works well. Cust. Support was great even thought they couldn't solve my problems."
2,Clip Arts,"Lots of clip arts, but the style and/or drawings are not good. It's good if you only need it for elementary schools or kids drawings. From a business perspective, I don't recommend them."
4,BIZARRE,"This Bizarre underground classic was photographed at the end of the hippy era by Charles Gatewood and included commentary by William S. Burroughs. The photos are seedy, surrealistic, disturbing and thought provoking even without the text. Burroughs' text, however, adds a dimension of examination (and self examination,) drawing one into the scene, giving a sense of attitude and mood. You will not walk away from this book unscathed."
3,O.K. but could have been better,"If you're looking to brush up on some of the roots of philosophy, this is a good book to read. This book is very short, hence why it is called Fragments. I read it in its entirety in an hour. I liked the fact that the author included the Greek translation along with the translation. However, the commentary is weak to be kind. There could have been much more regarding the influence of this work on the following Greek philosophers, or a look at parallel systems developing in the same time period. I recommend waiting for the paperback if one is ever published."
1,Another Thin Translation,"Enough of the Newage ""poetical"" translations -- Stephen Mitchell did us all a disservice. Try as they might, modern translators cannot convince that Heraclitus was a New Age thinker."
4,Great Translation from the Greek with a HORRID FORWARD!,I have long loved Heraclitus and this is a delightful translation. Read the helpful introduction by the author before you dive in BUT skip the horrid forward. It is filled with dozens of logical contradictions and makes Heraclitus sound like a POMO moron. Even the quotes used in the forward contradict the writer's terrible mis-reading of Heraclitus. I would have given the book 5 stars if the forward had been written by a real Heraclitus scholar or left out completely.
1,This title can be obtained for free from The Internet Archive.,"You can get these films in NTSC format, in ISO files which can be burnt to a DVD, for free, from The Internet Archive:[...]Or for the same episodes in the original PAL format, see this page:[...]Also, the running time of this DVD is stated to be 180 minutes; since there were 6 episodes in the series, that would make each episode only 30 minutes in length. This is far shorter than the runtime of the epsiodes ripped from the UKTV History channel, which are around 45 minutes each. (Those are the episodes on The Internet Archive.)And even those episodes are not complete - they were cut for UKTV History for reasons of commercial breaks. Only BBC2 aired the original, complete episodes (to my knowledge). Happily, Adam Curtis has published one of these complete episodes (#3, The League of Gentlemen) on his blog - however, this may only be visible to UK residents:[...]So, erm, don't buy this."
4,Better but still not complete,"The ceremonies of the modern roman rite does have a lot of usefull information. I especialy enjoyed reading in black and white the proper placement of the tabernacle and the rules on saying mass. So many priests ignore the proper ways and opt for keeping taberbacles in seperate chapels and use glass chalices. The ceremonies of the modern roman rite detail guidelines for liturgical colors, linens, vessels and vestments, the altar, the church, and much more. What i found lacking is the ceremonies themselves, It contains rituals which are reference only, incomplete. Just like the ceremonial of bishops, this book will give an outline for a ritual but refer to other texts for the complete ceremony. I reccomend The Rites vol 2 if you want actual rites and rituals. All in all this book is worth the price, though personally I would rather the american curch follow Rome more closley and leave the modern stuff to the protestants."
1,Buyer beware!,"This book offers idiosyncratic interpretations of the rubrics of the Roman rite and tries to pass them off as official and binding. For example, the discussion on the proper placement of the tabernacle (page 29) misrepresents what is actually said in the body of Roman ecclesiastical law on this subject. In giving directions to the celebrant for the communion rite (page 121), Eliot goes way beyond what is actually stated in the General Instruction of the Roman Missal, stating that the priest is to hold the paten in the left hand, hold the host at eye-level and so on. Thirty years ago the church abandoned this kind of writing about the liturgy for good reason: It mistakes mystification for mystery. This book fails to understand the nature of the renewed liturgy, and tries to put new wines in old wineskins."
2,MIND YOUR Ps AND Qs...EASE UP ON THE GLUE!,"When written English products are produced elsewhere there is the potential for goof-ups and second looks. This is one of those cases. The knot labels are odd looking, the lettering inconsistent, and strangely placed. The propensity for glue is over the top...literally. The cute little ship has hot glue residual all over. The result is a shadow box I want to tear into and redo."
2,confusing,"I am a fourth year spanish student, and this is the first year we had textbooks. These were the series of books chosen. I don't know about the other ones, but this book is seriously confusing. Much of the grammer covered is not covered extensively enough in explanation, and many of the exercises are too repetitive to do much good in the long run. I don't recommend this book."
1,Very unhappy - Unresponsive Vendor,I ordered a book for my daughter's school in the first week in August. It did not come in the estimated time frame so I had to rush order the book from another source with additional shipping charges. I had concerns about when the book would come so I emailed weekly but did not receive a response to any emails. After three emails and a final request for cancellation of the order I have still not received any response or refund. I have filed a complaint with Amazon as well. I generally do not submit reviews but I think this is so unprofessional.I would stay away from this vendor.
1,Made in BRAZIL -- NOT USA - What a deceptive Picture,"The picture on the Amazon leads you to believe that this is ""MADE IN USA"" and of high quality components.What a load of crack. Even on the back of the box, IT has ""MADE IN USA"" in a small print.Upon open it, it reads ""MADE IN BRAZIL"" in a sticker on the actual product, the plastic feels extremely cheap and the reading gauge is printed with ink that looks weak and cheap. There's a 2mm gap from the housing and the face plate (half side exposed).Lied and Betrayed by Morose, you've been warned. NEVER again I will buy a product from them again. Perhaps the earlier reviews were for the real ""made in USA"" products."
4,Gauge the gauge,"pretty nice toy, i bought the rubber cover for seven bucks. they coulda (shoulda) just jacked up the price $10 and included it in the first place. i like it cuz it's ez to adjust pressure by bleeding and the HUGE gauge is ez to reed. used 15 & 16 mm wrenches and a dab of spray silicone for rubber cover. easiest to slide it over from back to front. package says made in USA but label on gauge says made in brazil."
1,Waste of money for me!,"I bought this gage solely because I wanted high accuracy and reliability.After receiving the item, I wasn't happy with how bulky it is- but I was fine with that if it was at least accurate.At first, the gage was fine (it indicated my other cheaper gages were off by 2 psi). After a few weeks, though, the gage stopped returning to 0 psi (stuck at 5 psi). Consequently, all my readings became suspect (since they now indicated my cheaper gages were off by 7 psi) and I stopped using it. My cheaper gages may be off by 2 psi but hey, at least they still work.This is supposed to be a high quality product and hand calibrated, etc. But it's also a waste of money in my case.Note: I did not drop the gage or misuse it in anyway. Now, it's a high-end paper weight in my garage."
4,Shipping problems--rolls around in big box,"The guague is great, easy to use, seals well, and the manufacturer easy to contact and helpful. Ask, tho, that Amazon wrap the item well and put in bubble wrap/penuts, etc, 'cause two times they just sent it to me rolling around in a big box, which per the manufacturer, can damage it's accuracy."
4,Moroso 89560 Tire Gauge (0-60),This gauge works as advertised. It repeats measurements accurately and is easy to use although it does not hold readings when removed from stem. Bleeder works great.
2,Moroso 89560 tire pressure guage,"really difficult to use because the air line is too stiff. The tool is very accurate, just difficult to use."
1,Moroso 89560 Tire Pressure Gauge,"The Moroso 89560 Tire Pressure Gauge lasted almost one year from the date of purchase. Over a number of months I began getting different tire pressure readings each time I checked, often one right after another. I cannot in good conscience recommend the purchase of this gauge due to the fluctuations in readings. I discovered that the Moroso Gauge was consistantly off by 2-3 pounds. I have ordered a liquid filled tire pressure gauge from Longacre. It is supposed to be very accurate. [Moroso 89560 Tire Pressure Gauge, Dial Type, 0-60 psi]]."
3,doesn't create great seal,"product quality appears to be great with one exception, it doesn't appear to create an easy seal with the tire valve, making accidental leakage unavoidable and frustrating when trying to dial in a very specific tire pressure"
2,Crappy chuck,"I have tried this repeatedly and frankly I can't see how people like this piece of crap. The first thing out of the box I find that the chuck WILL NOT properly seat on the stem, and allows a lot of air to come out. It doesn't matter how many times you try, or how careful and determined you are. It simply will NOT seat with a great deal of force. By the time you've pressed hard enough for the air to stop leaking, a lot of it has.I don't care how accurate it is (or isn't). If the chuck is such a piece of crap, it renders the whole thing USELESS. I also have a $9 Slime digital, and it has no problem seating the first time with half the force.The only good thing is the chuck is attached with a nut and can be easily removed to put on a better one. But for $38 #$%^& dollars it should've come with one that worked!!"
3,"Nice gauge, but...","...the button valve doesn't work, so it won't hold a reading when you remove the gauge from the valve stem."
2,low quality,"The build quality on this is very poor. The cover for the gauge is cheap plastic and comes right off, the housing is very thin metal. I returned it."
5,Big Quality unit,"Nice unit, you do get what you pay for.You need the boot (see my seperate review for that, it is easy to fit with hot water!).Good to know your pressures are what they should be not a rough guess from the dollar store guage.Would be nice if there was a proper storage box but the boot helps."
5,Best purchase I ever made,"Around the first of February I ditched the holy inaccurate, piece of crap pencil gauge and bought a small $10 analog gauge at O'Reilly. That worked great the first attempt but after trying to check the pressures a month later the gauge wouldn't form a seal to save my life. It just bled air trying to check my left front tire. I had been contemplating purchasing this gauge based on the reviews but the price seemed pretty steep to me. Well after the $10 gauge crapped out I decided to take the plunge and order this along with the Viair 70p portable compressor. Just received it yesterday and I have to say it is well worth the money. It's sturdy, easy to read, and creates a tight seal for an accurate reading. When checking the left front tire the $10 gauge bled out 3psi of air! Quickly filled it back up to 35psi with the Viair compressor. If you are hesitating purchasing this because of the price, don't!"
5,"Simple, Effective Gauge","Professional quality gauge, and it shows. Accurate clear dial, and most importantly, the measurement head seats perfectly everytime on tire valve unlike the fiddly seals on many of the mass market digital units. Useful to also get the 89590 rubber cover for it to better protect the dail head."
4,Comprehensive Commentary on European Directors,"Students of theatre production and theory will find this book particularly helpful. While many texts dealing with the work of Stanislavsky, Meyerhold, Reinhardt, Brecht, and others focus on their theoretical contributions, Leiter spends a great deal of time exploring these men as directors. He includes a comprehensive commentary on their professional directing careers, rehearsal processes, relationships with collegues, and in-depth analyses of their trademark production elements. This book is a great resource to anyone interested in the practical manifestations of the theatre theories of the modern stage."
