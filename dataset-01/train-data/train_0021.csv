2,Nothing but fluff,"I have a hard time understanding why there are so many positive reviews here. This book is nothing but fluff. If you are anything more than a newbie, it's got nothing and if you're a complete newbie there's just enough information to be dangerous. She promises periodically that more information will be given about actually growing certain plants, but that information is never forthcoming.It's full of personal anectdotes that have little to do with the topic at hand, the tone is condescending and she encourages the use of poisons. She anthropomorphizes plants in an embarrassing way, telling a story about a poisonous plant she accidentally purchased as if it had a personal vendetta against her and her family. Her attitude toward plants goes beyond respect into something slightly off-kilter.The book is good for a giggle. If you must read it, make sure you have a firm grasp of both gardening and herbal magic first. Otherwise you could well follow this lady into lala land."
4,"Good, but slighlty fluffy!","I thought this book was a fun read! It had a lot of info on several topics related to garden witchery and the author is rather funny. I would have liked the book to have more depth, go more into detail rather than tell me I have to go find that info myself at the library>> !It was a little fluffy for my liking, but that did keep the feel of the book non-intimidating. Good section on Faeries. Good personal stories. Great suggestions for planting magickal gardens. Overall I enjoyed it and refered to it while planting my own Witch Garden!"
5,garden witchery,"As a beginner, I found this book informative and enjoyable.It was easy for me to understand and i came away with wonderful ideas for my small Magikal Garden.I now also understand why I feel so good in my small Garden space!!!Chalice"
2,"Wiccan ""Light""","I'm rating this the same as the Cottage Witchery book by the same author. I suppose it is nice for someone dabbling in Pagan faiths, very basic with some introduction. I thought it was a written a bit condescendingly and I have a problem with all of the rhyming spells. It is very distracting."
5,Perfectly Magickal ~*~,"This was my first introduction into the world of Ellen Dugan and a pleasant surprise. I was excited to find a book that combined my love of gardening and my growing curiosity of Wicca or the Pagan lifestyle. Ms. Dugan writes in a simplistic manner that is very easy to follow. She includes humor, folklore, and shares her experiences, thus making for an enjoyable read. I also find myself using this book as a reference of sort. She includes items such a flower correspondence, spells, rituals, and creating an environment. This book has suggestions for everyone!You may be surprised...you may have a new sparkle ~*~ when working out in your garden!I would recommend this book for the new, emerging, and curious reader. Someone with an open mind and who can appreciate all that nature has to offer. Take a stroll down the garden path and create a little magick of your own.Enjoy..."
5,Informative and Pragmatic,"I also would like to disagree with the reader from Jersey who completely slammed Garden Witchery. As a gardener with a couple years experience, I found this book to be quite useful. This book includes help/ideas on how to plan a garden, it goes over the different types of gardens, has info on pH levels in soil, fertilization, how to take care of your garden (i.e. pruning, dead-heading, etc.) and also includes fun ""magical"" correspondences to plants, flowers and trees. If you love to garden, you will enjoy this book, even if you're not into the whole ""magical"" aspect of it all. Even then, that information is at least fun and interesting to read. Honestly, when I was finished with the book, I wanted to run out and plant pumpkins! Read the book- you'll see..."
4,A Little Bit of Everything for a Witch's Garden,"Written in a friendly down to earth (no pun intended) style, this book contains gardening advice from both a practical and witchy perspective (with the emphasis on gardening). It includes detailed information on what kinds of plants do best in sun or shade, with the focus being on those that a witch would use most (moonlight gardens too). Tying into this are chapters on flower, tree and grown cover magick.The chapters on flower folklore, faery magick and specialty gardens are ""good to knows"", especially for green witches. Those on the Esbats and Sabbats contain something for any witch interested in working with their gardens and what they produce during these times."
2,Overpriced and too many restrictions on use,"This item is very overpriced. I ordered it because I wanted the very best, and I thought I would get what I paid for, but it is no different than other pans a half the price. Also, the information sheet that accompanied the pan had so many restrictions and warranty cop-outs that if followed would make the pan almost unusable."
3,I Am Very Concerned!,"I bought ths terrific little saucepan at the beginning of 2009. It's supposed to have a lifetime warranty (hmmm, my lifetime or its?) So far I've had 3 years of very happy cooking with it, but the other day I noticed very tiny pock marks on the inside bottom of the pan. I am concerned this may mean deterioration. I've had way too many experiences with non-stick pans, so when I purchased this one, I also added the Kaiser KaiserFlex Silicone Cooking Spoon to my Amazon order. The only cooking utensils ever used in this, or my other new pots and pans, are all silicone. I absolutely loved this pan so much, I bought the Anolon Advanced 3-1/2-Quart Covered Straining Saucepan a month later. That is strictly my pasta pan -- turns out perfect every time. Has anyone else experienced this happening to their Analon pans? Would appreciate input from other people on my problem."
2,3.5 Quart Covered Straining Saucepan,"I was very disappointed in this saucepan. I was cooking macaroni with the pot only half full of water with the lid on, vents closed. The lid does not seal tightly so I expected some steam release. I left the pan for a few minutes and when I returned boiling water was seaping out around the lid down the sides and all over the whole ceramic stovetop. What a mess! I have not experienced this with other pots. (Yes I know that if you fill a pot near the top you have to watch it closely, but this was only half full). I probably would not buy again."
2,Sixty five dollars?,"You must be kidding me no matter how good the saucepan is. Amazon pricing policy can be very shady at best, look someplace else."
5,Outstanding cookware,"This is my first piece of Anolon cookware, and it definitely will not be my last. While a bit pricey, it is an excellent piece of workmanship, heats evenly and fairly quickly, cleans up very nicely with just hot water. It has become my go-to pot for items like hot cereal, rice and thick sauces. The lid fits beautifully; the lid's handle will get hot during long, slow cooking (no surprise), but the pot's handle usually stays quite safe to handle (unless I let the gas flame get too high, and overlap the sides of the pot).Definitely gets my evaluation of excellence."
2,More reliable information is available,"Kent Hovind is not a scientist, biologist, or archeologist. He was a Christian school teacher who begain collecting and compiling information and theories about creationism and evolution into a series of lectures and sermons. Some of what he has to say is good, while some is rejected by even creationists. Dr. Hovind is also a believer in conspirarcy theories regarding the UN, the US Government, and 9-11, and is a tax resister (which led to his conviction on tax evasion charges). While this has little to do with his work on creationism, it does call into question his credibility.If you want to research or study creationism, I recommend that you pass on Dr. Hovind's work and check out material by organizations like Answers In Genesis and Creation Ministries International. They employ real scientists and are much more reliable sources of creationist material."
3,Good tea,"A good tea at a bulk price. It tastes good and I got enough that I can drink it fairly often without spending a lot of cash, what more can I say?You have to be careful with this tea, overbrewing will make it very bitter. I normally leave my tea in longer than recommended because I like stronger flavor, but this was a little much even for me. After about 6 minutes it starts to taste like coffee...It tastes great, but its not terribly fragrant, which is half of the appeal for me. My coworkers can always tell when I have my Earl Grey, but this just smells like mild vanilla. The string on the bag is not the strongest, and several times has pulled off the bag, leaving the bag to sink to the bottom of my vacuum flask.All in all, I'd buy it again but this might not be what I serve guests."
1,Not good at all!,"This book actually pokes on Henry's contemporaries and describes series of events which will eventaully lead to a horrendous headache to be suffered by the reader. On the other hand, Fielding's Tom Jones is a delight and mustn't be missed at any cost! This book is a total waste, though!"
3,Joseph Andrews,"I enjoyed Fielding's sense of humor, his appreciation of human foibles. Joseph Andrews is a good story and becomes more entertaining as it moves along. Parson Adams is my favorite character."
4,magnitude 9 are a pretty good prog metal band,"Heard the first one, and own the latest. These guys have great music. The vox are very good mix of G. Tates and B. Dickinson voice, the guitarist sounds alot like Malmsteen with the only difference that Malmsteen does not know how to compose, and the rest of the band fill in the sound just right. If you like Dream Theater, Malmsteen, Rainbow,..and other Prog Groups like Symphony X (BEST PROG METAL BAND), Conception, e.tc. you will definetley love this guys.... The singer's previous band PSYCHO DRAMA was excellent!!!!!!!!!!"
5,The Best Place to Learn About Reformed Christian Theology,"I have been reading through this edition of the Institutes for a little over seven months with the goal to finish it within a year. I have finished the first volume and have started the second. I am learning so much from Calvin's writings which teach me why I believe what I believe. I am much better informed when defending orthodox Christianity than I ever have been before. You can follow my progress at [...].This is a very easy to read translation unlike several others I have looked at before. The index is great for looking up doctrine based on key words or Scripture passages.If you are looking to purchase a copy of the Institutes, this is the one that I would recommend. It seems to be the one that most seminaries are currently using as well. There is a book calledAnalysis of the Institutes of the Christian Religion of John Calvinthat is a perfect companion to this edition of the Institutes."
3,Only three stars. . .,". . .because I am not a Calvinist!HOWEVER, there is no denying that John Calvin was one of the greatest theological thinkers of all time, regardless of whether one accepts his views. Certainly, among Protestantism, his work represents the first, and until Karl Barth's ""Church Dogmatics"", the greatest attempt at Systematic Theology in the Reform Protestant tradition. His work gave legitimate academic and philosophical credibility to the Reformation.His ""Institutes"" deserve a place in the library of every theologian, regardless of denominational affiliation or level of agreement. It's too important an historical resource to be without."
3,Sorry,"The Shrouds first disc just left me kind of wondering. Their follow up was superb but this album had many a hole. Caged Bird is excellent though and well worth the price of the disc, imo. But the rest of the album kind of lacked. I wish I could say something positive about this album besides the fact that Caged Bird is good. But I can't. Total honest truth, start with their follow up then come back and get this one. Her vocals got stronger and the follow up was really sonic and had some great melody. It's not a horrible album, don't get me wrong. But they got much better and I think the consumer should opt for the secodn then the first ;)."
3,Goth?,"If you are looking for ""Sisters of Mercy"" or ""BauHaus""- forget it! If you're into Concrete Blond, you shouldn't be disapointed. It may grow on me, but NOT what I expected."
3,OK Book,I found this to be a tough topic but it was a school requirement. Alot of these concepts can probably be taught through computer software which can make the learning experience easier
4,Pretty good but one flaw,"These cds sound great. Unfortunately, the version of Smithers-Jones found here is the one with orchestral accompaniment from Setting Sons. If you prefer the single; the hard-driving electric version of the song, as I do, you will have to buy Snap! or Extras. If you liked 'The Bitterest Pill (I Ever Had To Swallow)', you will not find that in this collection either. Because it was released as a single, you must look for it on another compilation like 'The Jam - Greatest Hits', or 'The Very Best of the Jam'."
2,A Disappointment,"I've long been a fan of Robert B. Parker Spenser books but, even though I watched them, I didn't really care much for the Robert Urich ""Spenser for Hire"" series. Too 'goody two-shoes' and 'television-ized.' That's why, when I found these Joe Mantegna movies, I enthusiastically thought that someone made some Spenser movies that were a little more 'raw' and true to the books. What a disappointment! The stories were accurate enough, but Joe Mantegna as Spenser? A former cop and boxer? I don't THINK so! I found him, and the actors filling the roles of Hawk and Susan to be completely unbelievable and wrong for the parts. These movies really made me MISS the Robert Urich series!"
5,The only reference you will need for the exam,"I'm somewhat of a certification junkie (MCP, MCSD, SCP, and now SCWCD) so I've had my fair share of good and bad certification books.With a basic understanding of JSP and this book, I took the exam and broke the record for the highest mark at the testing centre.This is one of the few books that will likely get you certified without prior J2EE reading or experience. (Assuming you are familiar with J2SE)"
5,Excellent book,"I work as a contractor and I had to get the SCWCD certification because my company forced me to. I bought this book mainly for this purpose and I am very much satisfied with it as I passed the exam with 93%.I have been working with JSP/Servlets for an year now, and I had no intention to spend a lot of time in studying for the certification. I just wanted to cram the required stuff and get it over with. However, while reading this book, I really felt like reading it because it is filled with information and the writing style is so easy going.I would recommend it even if one is not studying for the certification."
4,"Good study guide, if out of date and a little boring","This is a solid and useful study guide. Especially useful are the questions at the end of the each chapter, the electronic practice exams on the CD, and the quizlets. The book lacks hands on programming projects, or programming assignments, which would have been really useful for solidifying the material. Yes, you can make stuff like this up for yourself, but then why are you buying a book?Also note that this book is not for the current version of the exam, and after december 14th 2004, the version of the exam that the book was made for will no longer be relevant.My favorite chapter was the one on enterpise design patterns. The author also has a good little section on showing how all of the design patterns presented fit into the enterprise architecture as a whole."
2,Did Anyone take the time to edit this book's content?,The book communicates well but the errors in the book get to be distracting very quickly. There are 15 pages of errata on the author's web site. People learning a new subject can only trust the author and depend upon each and every written word. In this case only to find that the author violates that trust. Who needs this type of headache?If you are going to publish books with this many errors why don't you publish your home phone number with the book so you can correct the mistakes for each of us when we find them?This is not an acceptable level of professionalism to me. Do it well or do something else!
2,Out of Date,"I read this book prior to sitting the exam, then used some other exam simulation software and felt a little bewildered because I thought I must have been missing something, somewhere. Then I read the Sybex book on the same certification and and it all made sense.While I think this may have been a good book a while back, sadly it is out of date and best left on the shelf."
2,Not that great,"First, this book is out of date. Second, the practice questions are way too easy. Overall, not that great, but the only thing available on this subject."
5,A must have book for certification,"This is a best book i have read for a long time. A must have book for SCWCD exam. All aspects of an exam are covered throughly and in depth. I recently passed an exam just studying this book.The language used is very easy to follow and all examples are explained fully. I think it would not be wrong to say, anybody learning Servlets and JSP must read this book before refering to any other resource. I give 6 stars to it out of 5.Looking forward to some more good things form the same Authors. I will be the first one to buy."
5,Perfect book for SCWCD as well as JSP/Servlets in general!!!,"I just took the SCWCD after finishing this book. This is THE book to read for cracking the SCWCD! And not only is this the perfect study guide, but it also explains in a most lucid manner several aspects of JSP/Servlets that may have been difficult to grasp before. In short, as good as it gets!"
2,Outdated!,"This book was good during it's time, but now it is outdated. The book is designed for SCWCD 1.3, and did a great job covering all the topics. However, Sun Microsystem discontinued SCWCD 1.3 on December 2004. So, if you are like me, disappointed with head first books and looking to be certified as fast as possible, do yourself a favor and buy the second edition of this book. You won't regret it."
5,Great book!!!,"This book covers pretty much all areas in JSP and Servlets for Web developers exam preparation. It covers J2EE and even Tomcat in details. Worth buying not only for exam preparedness, but, also as a reference guide for all your answers to the Web development using Java."
4,Great buy,"I would have given it 5 stars but for some annoying typos. I gave 4 stars because the content is top quality. At least I didn't see any conceptual mistakes as in the sybex book. Authors know what they are talking about.Exam coverage: Excellent. Explains the concepts thru simple examples. Chapters contain 'Quizlets', which are short questions and answers. They make an interesting reading. Quick prep is quite valuable."
4,Good,"Studied with this book and the servlet and JSP specifications for about two weeks and passed with 91%. There is quite a bit to memorize, but the exam itself was not too difficult."
5,best certification book I've read,"Many others have sang praise of this book. Suffice it to say, they are correct. This is a great book -- not just to pass this certification, but also a great reference.I passed with 93% after studying it for 12 days and it took me 43 minutes to write a 90 minute exam.I know this exam can be passed by doing a brain dump. But I didn't do that. I read and understood all the concepts in the book, and it was more than enough to do well on this exam."
5,Awesome book - recommend for every J2EE programmers,"This is the best Servlet/JSP book I have read - I read so many other books but no other book duplicates the coverage and depth of this book.I passed the test using this book but I am happier about finding this little treasure. Currently, I am converting WebSphere to WebLogic application and I'm keeping this book right besides me. I'm refactoring this old legacy code and converting to the latest standard.I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn servlet and JSP. It may be not for the beginners but definitely you need to have a copy of it if you are serious about servlet/JSP."
5,A Book with both EXAM & REFERENCE COMPONENT.,This is an excellent book. I would recommend to carry this book even after passing the exam as it serves as a good reference on many areas within the J2EE.
4,Excellent Resource for the SCWCD Exam,This book is well written with clear explainations and simple but illustrative code examples. It flows well introducing topics in a manner that incrementally builds your understanding of the material. Highly recommended.
3,too many typos,I'm up to chapter 4 of this book and I already saw too many typos. It looks like this book was poorly proof-read.
5,Best Test Preparation Material for SCWCD 1.3,"This is not only a good book for SCWCD 1.3 exam, but also a good reference for web application development. I read this book thoroughly and took some mock exams available in the internet, then i appeared for the real exam. I got 98%. I would strongly recommend this book for customers to buy."
2,Errate almost as big as the book,"I just printed this book's errata, which is 14 pages long. Then I took a pencil and tried to correct all the errors in the book - well at least all the errors that are mentioned in the errata.While this is probably the best book available to get ready for the SCWCD exam,14 pages of errata is a lot. This book if full of errors and should be recalled.I completely lost my trust in the publisher (Manning) and don't consider them anymore when buying books.Go and get an O'Reilly book - they actually do review 'em - even before they go to print."
5,Passed with 98%!!,A great book not only for the exam but for future reference. The writing is precise and concise. The material is well laid out both for the exam as well as for a quick lookup for information while at work. A great bridge between the person taking the test and the dry and boring specification from Sun (they are meant to be that way). Their handling of JSP tags is better than the 2 books I have on Servlets/JSP.Wish they had a book for the Sun Certified Business Component Developer exam.Raj Auradkar
5,Way better than shaving and/or waxing!!,I have owned this product for a month now and I love it. I was tired of shaving my legs every other day it seemed. Waxing was too expensive to have done professionally. And I found it too messy when I tried to do it at home. So I went searching for another way to solve the problem. I stumbled upon the Philips Norelco HP6409 Satinelle Soft Epilator. I did some research online and decided to give it a try. I totally love it. It works really well. At first it hurts a little but I didn't think it was as bad as waxing. After a few times though you really hardly feel it anymore. I like the fact that you don't have any sticky wax and you don't have to have water and soap or shaving cream. You can just whip it out turn it on and away goes the hair. I have only used it on my legs so I can't comment on using it for any other hair removal. If you are tired of the mess and hassle of shaving and/or waxing I recommend you give this a try.
2,Didn't work that great for me..,"I was so excited to get this and try it! I am pregnant and had gone and had my legs waxed so I wouldn't have to contort my body to get to my legs. Then I read all the reviews and decided I could save money if I just bought this instead of waxing. Well, it didn't really work for me. I have light, thin hair on my legs and it just seemed to break them off. The ones that it actually pulled out left little dot bruises on my legs so I had to wear long pants anyhow. The hair all grew back within a few days (no better than shaving) and it left my legs really, really, really dry. I wasn't any more impressed with the results of waxing, so I think I'll just be sticking with a razor. The size is great, it didn't hurt much (but it just broke off the hairs!), and seemed like a great little gizmo, but it just isn't for me."
2,Breaks more hairs than it plucks,"It was not wat I was expecting! My friend has a different model of Santinelle Norelco that I tried and loved it, but this one breaks more hair than it pluncks, the massager is useless and you have to go many times over the same area to remove all the hair."
3,ouch,"i got this as an experiment in body hair. Ouch it gets easier after the first time but it still hurts. this is designed for fine womans hair, but i tried it with mine and it was nice not having to shave certain places for a week, but it is not worth the pain."
3,A good introduction to the topic but dated,"This book provides a good introduction to the topic but, unfortunately, suffers from the fact that it is dated. It was published in the mid 1990s and hence contains ""state of the art"" information that was only that back then. Many significant advances have been made since then in many of the areas the book covers (i.e., sleep apnea, depression, chronic fatigue, etc.). Nevertheless the book still provides a good introduction. It covers what, even today, are considered the main causes of chronic fatigue such as sleep disorders, mental conditions such as depression, allergies and dietary problems. Each of these is covered in separate chapters. In addition, chapters are provided on exercise and sleep but, unfortunately, none is provided on stress.In short, the book provides a good but dated introduction to its subject."
4,Reader,"This book isn't always hard-hitting, but it does bring up some of the hardships brought about by the bear market. With the pundits disgraced, it's helpful to see what every day investors have to say about the market. For Wall Street professionals, the book also provides a look into the minds of the folks they're trying to woo. The book doesn't promise to make anyone rich, but it does deliver rich lessons in the stock market from the perspective of Main Street."
3,Nothing spectacular,"Virgin Fleet starts out with a bit of comedy, perhaps even a Project A-ko feel, but soon loses that aspect for a more serious look. The series fails to have good character development, and due to this, some moments are not as powerful as they were meant to be. You might enjoy watching the DVD once, but don't expect to be watching this over and over. I felt like I was forced to watch the last episode just so that I could put the DVD away.Unfortunately, the DVD comes with close to no extras: the English/Japanese dialogue with options for subtitles, and a few trailers of other series, but that's it."
5,A classic. Not for everyone,"This is agreat book for anyone who has a good understanding of behavioral psychology. If you do, this book will help explain the concepts employed by psychologists today. It also gives the reader a good feel for the attitudes that prevailed in psychology in the 1950's. If you do not have a strong background in this area, I would suggest reading one of Skinner's later books first."
1,not worth the money,"I generally expect to get what I pay for...I think I paid $15 for this thing so I really wasn't expecting much from it. Well that's exactly what I got. Even from as little as 7 feet away, my signal strength was under 50% and sometimes would totally go away. I wish I wouldn't have wasted that money - don't waste yours. This is one product Airlink shouldn't have put out."
2,the quality is worth the price i paid,"$13. 45 feet away from the router, and the signal strength lingered between 5% - 15% and, for the most part, would not work. the driver/installation cd's autorun would not work, so i had to go through ""explore"" to install the drivers off of the cd. if you're within 20 feet from the computer, and want to save money, then maybe you should buy this. if that were the case for me, i still wouldn't. it's just pure junk."
2,"Poor signal, overheats","Bought this item locally and paid around $30. Setup with my XP desktop system went well enough and throughput was sufficient to watch videos via the wireless network. But after a week or two of use, I noticed my signal strength steadily dropped from the high 40s initially down to 15-25%. When the signal gets down below about 30% Web pages start loading slowly and videos start buffering more than usual. Also, I noticed that the Airlink adapter would be almost too hot to touch, so I developed the habit of unplugging it when not actually in use, which is a pain. I'm returning this item and will try a PCI adapter next."
2,Not as good as other brands,"I used this adapter for my laptop, as previous reviewer mentioned, installation is easy, and it connected to my local wireless network with no probelm. The range is good too, I connected through 100ft away, no problem, signal stayed at 50%.The problem I am having is that my laptops are configured to ""Stand By"" after a while, I never competely shut them down, and after waking them up from Stand By, the adapter refused to find wireless network again, even I unpluged the adapter and re-plug it back, it resisted to work. I believe it's a bug. I had to re-start laptop to make it connect, The other well known brand cards can connect to network from any state of the laptop: wake up from stand by, or unplug/plug, etc.I give it 2 star, basically because it's designed for laptop but this is unacceptable.I also tried Airlink's cardbus adapter(awlc3026), same problem. I won't use AirLink's products anymore."
2,Not as bad as I originally thought,"Initially I had some trouble using this in an upstairs room and thought it was just a cheap product. I opened a few doors and the signal has strengthened noticeably, so maybe it's not so bad. It's small, looks and feels flimsy, and gets a little hot during use. The software is simple, but simplicity can be a virtue. I guess for the price this adapter gets the job done as long as you're not seeking top notch quality, reliability and durability. I can't change the number of stars but I would amend to 3 if I could."
4,Siousxie And The Banshees - 'Gold Remixes' (Universal Int'l) 2-CD,"Never been all THAT thrilled about remixes,but this compilation is well assembled, I thought. On disc one,you get basically a fifteen track anthology of tunes like ""Dear Prudence"", ""Cities In Dust"", the inspiring ""Happy House"", ""Christine"", my all time Siousxie&The Banshees favorite ""Spellbound"", ""Killing Jar"" and the rather dark ""Arabian Knights"". Disc two provides nine(9)remixes, some are of cuts that I've already listed. Pretty much aimed at long time Siousxie fans. Well worth checking out."
3,"A decent read, but there are better books for beginners.","This is actually one of the first Wicca/Witchcraft books I got, and I am glad there are better ones out there (Scott Cunningham, Raymond Buckland, Starhawk, to name a few). Laurie Cabot seems a bit strict, and she has some different ingredients for spells and such that the average person won't be able to obtain. A bit to rigid for my taste, and may scare off many beginners who read any of her work early in their studies"
1,Not recommended to anyone,"There is some good information in this book(like the crystal countdown). But most seemed mindless and I found more than a few factual errors. It seems as if i am only the only one who disliked this book, so I just had to put my two cents in."
2,Don't spend your money on it,"While the book have the basic stuff just fine, and contains some other not original but very good basic technices, I find it too basic, even for beginners. The book have some major annoing stuff like the babbling about history, the authors have tried to connect everything to older traditions, but it all sounds like fairy tales we all heard before...Not up to date and new elightning facts that makes us say wow.As for beginners, there are other good books that contain alot more info, better written and are alot more fun to learn from."
5,my favirote craft book,"this is my most favirote book ever. love cabot's writing, even though she seems a little strict, but i look past that and i look at what the book really means."
4,good as an introduction to Wicca,"I met Laurie Cabot about 20 years ago and she facinated me then. I never really was interested in reading her books due to other involvements in my life, until recently when I decided to reinvestigate WICCA as something I wanted to learn more about. This book helped me learn about the origins and history of witchcraft and found it very informative."
4,Easy read,"I bought this book while going on a kick of learning about Wicca. It was the most informative and easy read of all the books that I got a hold of. Although I am not a practicing Wiccan, I kept this book for furture reference.This book goes into some history, the basis of witchcraft, and how to cast spells. Cabot explains how to use Wicca in every day life, which some I use: placing crystals to enhance energy, etc. She also touches upon enhancing your own psychic energy. It was truly a good read, even for those just wanting to learn more about the religion but not to practice. Would work well as a simple reference too."
5,One of the best for beginners,"I read the reviews on this book and decided to purchase it and couldn't be happier that I did. I love the way the chapters are set up so I could jump around if necessary and I love that it included aspects of Wiccan history and the science behind some practices, which many books don't include. Although it may not include absolutely everything it includes enough of a background on everything to help a beginner start their studies. I would definitely recommend this book it is one of my favorites and up there with Scott Cunningham's work."
5,Required Reading,"This book is a MUST. It grounds Witchcraft in both Science AND Image-ination, a balance absolutely necessary for anyone practicing the Magickal Arts. From there on it's up to you, but this book is one of the best ways to start."
1,Is being a Witch really this hard????,"This was one of the first books I picked up when I first started studying the Craft, right along with Wicca: A Guide for the Solitary Practioner. I found it as alot of jibberish, granted there was some decent parts, most of it seemed like it was written for her and only her and those she teaches. I found most of it difficult to understand, and her version of the Craft seemed so organized; for instance, your altar MUST look like this. Needless to say, Cunninghams book I finished, Ms Cabot's, I did not."
2,Not Impressed by Cabot,"I expected great things from Cabot's books. I was let down. I did not care for her writing style, nor did I find her information moving or educational. I am genuinely surprised that so many people find Cabot to be a literary value. I just don't see it. I would not recommend Cabot's works to anyone interested in paganism or witchcraft."
1,Please don't go here!,"This book is just awful. Written at a fourth grade reading level but I would not recommend it for children. It is just disappointing. It seems it was written in a rush and not researched at all. If you want a beginners book or something on the basics or informative, don't read this."
3,"Laurie Cabot, the Martha Stewart of Witchcraft","The Power of The Witch is a great read, but little else. Ms. Cabot seems to be a bit formal and strict. I wouldn't recommend this as a first read to anyone new to Witchcraft. Though I understand that she is the Grand Dame of Salem, her style is to uptight and rigid. She also tends to focus on the religious aspect of Withcraft solely, and not everyone is comfortable with that"
5,Good Morning!,"This was my first book of this subject, actually given me by a friend. CAbot's writing is super, and this book taught me a lot. It's informative, instructional, humorous, and very useful to me. Thumbs up ^"
5,Power of the Witch by Laurie Cabot and Tom Cowan,"This was the first book I ever read on Witchcraft...my life has not been the same since. I see the world through different eyes now. Laurie Cabot does a wonderful job of dispelling the myths about Wicca as she unveils the beauty of it. Power of the Witch is a must for anyone seeking the truth about Witchcraft. This book is easy to read and follow. I have read literally hundreds of books on Wicca and Witchcraft....Power of the Witch is still my favorite, and I recommend it to all. Just reading this book is a magical and transforming experience in itself. I have never read any book that has had such a profound effect on my life. Absolutely the best!!!"
4,good book for the advaced witch,this book was very good laurie really hit home for us witches.This book may be confusing to the begining witch but i strongely reccommend the more advanced witch to read this. Laurie has many other great books that are easy for the new-coming-witch to follow so read those! be sure to call laurie wiccan store in salem mass. here's the number 1-978-744-6274the store is ran by witches. well gotta go blessed be!
5,autry superstar,"This CD is great . I play it all day . I put this CD on my Computer and dropped a tune or two from play list that were not my Fav. like 'Good Night Irene' and now I play it a lot . Great Sound , Great Tunes . Gene Was Tops and deserves all 5 Stars on The Walk of Fame ."
5,Guiding the Family - excellent,"Very good reference for this chaotic world. Teachers, parents, and caregivers can learn a lot from this insightful book. It would give you an idea why being permissive to children is not advisable. Each adult should be responsible in raising children. You can just imagine yourself like a shepherd and guiding your flock of sheep towards the right path. If one sheep strays away, you pull it back again to follow the flock once again.Excellent reference even for teachers. It provides a deeper insight on families. It will help teachers on how to relate with their students and their families more effectively. Advice, suggestions, comments, and biblical teachings included. Truly, it shows the many support groups, institutions, and organizations in the community that you can collaborate with."
3,yeah Blitz,"This was my first blitz album, I'd heard them before and really liked it. This album has both live, studio and later Blitz. Overall it's cool to hear them live but I could live with out some of the later tracks. A fair beginning blitz experience."
3,May be nice for other instruments but not for the guitarist,This really has the best of U2 but it's not the best when it comes to the tablature. Sure the songs sound the same but I've personally found that they don't match. I've seen videos and watched Edge's finger placement and it was completely different than some of these tabs. If you're looking to play what the Edge plays.. look elsewhere..
3,"Solid, sheet music","I am a humble basement player who plays for myself and two kids, so I'm no professional although I have been playing for 10 years and know my way around ""campfirey"" sheet music. This book is good for the amateur -- songs both easy and difficult. As someone who usually rips TAB from various internet sources, this book was not beyond my musical reading ability. Clear chord changes and tabbed notes that didn't require a magnifying glass to read. Sometimes there are cheat chord diagrams before each song, and sometimes there are not. You can figure out fingerings from the tabbed music tough.I don't expect I'll ever nail these songs in a note-for-note fashion; but for basic strumming I've got ""All I Want Is You"" and ""Desire"" already down.Better musicians will get more out of this book. It is not an Easy Chord format. My grade is more reflective of my ability to use this book than it's value to someone else.I"
5,praising The LORD,"every song in this collection is inspiring! One of my all time favorites. All of the songs are good, unlike some collections that only have a few good ones..."
3,average at best on blu ray,Some really rare footage but stuff from this era does not translate to blu-ray. It does have interviews with the actual people if you like that stuff.
5,This Book Rocks!,"A new twist on the Fantasy genre, this book literally transforms the modern world into a magical setting. The idea of America losing technology, and magic returning to earth is brilliant. This is no generic hack and slash novel, and it isn't some boring philosophical treatise, either. The characters are real, and have both strengths and flaws. They get in fights, yet have to rely on each other for survival. There's plenty of action, but there's actual substance between the battles. Oh yeah, one more thing, the magic ROCKS. If you like Weis and Hickman, McCaffrey or Jordan, this book's for you."
5,Excellent! Highly Recommend!,"This is one of the most unique stories that I have read in a long time! Not since Stephen King started his Dark Tower series have I read a book this intriguing and different. The characters are all very interesting and the story is quite compelling. It was hard to put the book down! If you are looking for a great science fiction story that's a cut above the rest, this is it. Can't wait for the next in the series!"
5,Excellent Biographical Documnetary,"I am lucky enough to have an 1822 published book by Duke & Brown of SC and purchased another newer reprint to read. This book is told as a matter of fact document about the remarkable life of Archibald Campbell as he spent 6 yrs at sea. It does not have an emotional quality and reads dry. However, reading between the lines you begin to get an insight into the hardships, perseverance and tenacity of this man. A truly inspiring biography. Books like this should become part of a well read library."
4,In the tradition of Walking Tall...,"Baker battles corruption yet again in this worthy follow-up to Walking Tall. All the elements for a classic 70's redneck revenge picture are here: corrupt cops, sicko henchmen, unlikely allies (including Gabe Dell and Brock Peters) and a long-suffering faithful girlfriend (Connie Van Dyke). Joe Don plays Lewis, a bar-owner and gambler who (wait for it) gets framed and is sent to the big house. Befriended by a mobster (John Marley!), Lewis gets enough info and ammo to go after those who took almost everything from him. The violence is brutal and the revenge is quite sweet.This looks to be Karlson's last movie; if you've seen some of his earlier noirish epics (like Kansas City Confidential and Phenix City Story), you'll know what to expect. This is a GREAT unsung little film."
4,De Niro does it again,"After seeing this film on large screen, I knew I wanted it for my own. De Niro's character is so convincing we forget the young, thin man of The Godfather or Taxi Driver. He's great. When I saw the film, I was one of 7 or 8 elderly women who comprised the audience at an early afternoon showing. I think young people may not have appreciated the story, but we old ladies thought it was definitely worth seeing."
2,Original film is better.,"This film is quite good, but the original Italian film, is a thing of pure beauty.Again Hollywood tailors a great idea, for an American market.Don't get me wrong, this version is 'fine' but the original 'Stanno tutti bene' is brilliant."
2,AN okay movie but kind of depressing.,Robert Deniro is good in this movie but the content is depressing. It is funny in some parts but I would not see it again.
4,"Trailers misleading, but good movie","My husband and I recently watched this movie and based on the trailers we had seen, were both under the impression it was a comedy. It was not, but it was a very heartfelt drama which causes one to reflect with their relationship with their children. I would recommend watching this."
3,Slow tear Jerker - but with a good message,"From my wife Sarah: Parents and even anyone in a family relationship may learn something important from the message of this movie, and for that reason it may be worth viewing. The other good thing was the acting. Deniro and all of the cast in fact, was excellent, but I'd expect nothing less from each of these fine actors.That said, the movie was very, very slow. We're talking really slow and very dull during much of it. It's also a tear jerker. If you've ever lost anyone, be prepared to cry and grieve. I did quite a bit of sobbing. We chose to watch a comedy afterwards just to recover from this movie. We felt so deeply bummed out through much of it.I tend to watch my favorite movies over and over, and this is not a movie I'd watch again. However there are some people who should actually be given this movie as a gift. If you or someone you know pushes their kids hard, and maybe too hard, they should view this movie."
1,I hate it,"because I believe in God through Jesus Christ and DeNiro curse God. I though to give to the library, but I did not agreed with it because it was not a solution so I break it and trash it."
1,heart breaking,"As a christian: this was blaspheme. Never heard such language before, thank God! Can't imagine these people standing before God some day, giving an account of their lives. (and they most certainly will, as we all will)"
2,Everybody's Fine DVD,The DVD's sound track was defective which made watching the movie challenging. The sound would come and go. The movie itself had a good story line.
2,not particularly good,"A set of very unusual dysfunctional grown-up children who seem to be incapable of relating to their father. The story proceeds as if it's being written as it was being filmed. Unfortunately there's really no character development behind any of the people involved, so we don't know why they turned out the way they did. It's a sad movie and I'd recommend avoiding it."
3,Everybody's Fine,"This life like story was depressing in a way that you never know what is happening with your children. A man loses his wife and he thinks he knows what the children are doing because he has set such high standards for them only to find out that none of them are what he thought but in their own way, they are surviving. As an older person, I feel that I need to trust that the children will find happiness in their own way."
3,Everbody's Fine,I am a Robert DeNiro fan. This movie was quite good and quite touching. I had thought it would be more of a comedy. How ever it was a good film.
4,A GOOD CAST AND A GREAT DENIRO PERFORMANCE MAKE THIS FILM A WINNER!,"This was a hard film to watch for me because my father has always reminded me of Robert DeNiro and he lost his wife my mother a year and a half ago. DeNiro gives a wonderfully touching performance as a father who maybe pushed his kids a little too hard to achieve their dreams when they were young and they seem to avoid him because they feel they might not have lived up to his expectations.What is most impressive besides DeNiro in this film is that it never feels forced and we are slowly let into the world of this family. It's a sad film, but very rewarding and worth the trip if you don't mind shedding a few tears along the way."
5,Great movie,My mom died and recommended this to my siblings...I can relate to it!DeNiro is fabulous...and many families may experience this scenario.
3,Kind of boring road movie,"In 2009's ""Everybody's Fine"" Robert De Niro plays a widower who is down because his four kids all canceled on coming home for Thanksgiving, so he decides to go see each one instead (Kate Beckinsale, Sam Rockwell and Drew Barrymore respectively). This entails traveling all over the country over the next week or so.I don't get all the positive ratings on this one. Sure, it's well made, has a great cast and makes a good point, but it's just humdrum from beginning to end. Maybe the story works better for those who can relate to De Niro's character, but for everyone else this is a really slow and boring road movie. Being boring is the ultimate sin in cinema.If you want to see Sam Rockwell and Kate Beckinsale in an outstanding drama be sure to check out 2007's ""Snow Angels.""GRADE: C"
4,Everybody's fine,"The preview made it seem different, still a good movie. worth the money. I was able to predict things that happened except the end."
4,family time,In this movie a father goes to great lengths to get his family together. I feel that all his kids lying about their situation is so wrong. Overall this movie is ok but it takes a while to lead up to its climax.
4,Heart Warming and Sad,"Heart Warming and Sad at the same time. A great cast and unlike any other movie I've seen. A bit slow, but worth the $3.99 it costs to rent."
3,"Hindsight is better than foresight, unfortunately","In contrast to the first Megatrends book that came out in 1984, this book is way off the mark. His economic analysis is always interesting, but this time, for the most part, his trends have not panned out. I found this book to be a much slower read than the first Megatrends. Even so, I still plan to look for Megatrends 2010 when it comes out."
1,Sequels are almost always disappointing,"Having been so impressed with the original ""Megatrends,"" I was very much looking forward to this edition. Unfortunately,the authors' crystal ball failed too often this time around to inspire much confidence. One major flaw, I think, is that there is much less content analysis used in tracking these trends and far too much fluff in the way of interviews and anecdotes. Too, in ""Megatrends,"" statistics were used to back up forecasts derived from content analysis. Here statistics and surveys seem to be the sole basis for the forecasts. Perhaps the authors' thought the original work was too dry, or perhaps they were just trying to capitalize on a winner with a quick and dirty follow-up. In any case, this book was not nearly as insightful, or useful"
1,Don't be fooled!,"Sounds up to date, and I bought it thinking it new, but tired forecasts from 1990 can easily be beaten by anyone of average thinking from the vantagepoint of 2000. Avoid and think for yourself instead!"
1,No Internet!,Guess what word does not appear in this book? That's right... INTERNET!Not even once!So Naisbitt missed the biggest trend of the nineties!
3,No more Mr. Wiseguy,"I know, it's a little late to be reading this book in 2003...nostalgia, anyone? One trend missed apparently: the rise of terrorism. This goes hand in hand with the fall of communism, because now there's a new bad kid on the block: move over communism, center stage Jihadists. The reprise of fundamentalism was noted in the book, and the turn to the political right, and the concurrent diminution of the ""welfare state."" Naisbitt et al. wrote about ""no more wars."" They should have read Lorenz, ""On Aggression,"" before saying all that. War may be inevitable, if aggression is instinctual, but war doesn't have to be always destructive: extreme sports, war games, ritual matches (presidents playing chess?) could do it. Diximus."
2,Mega boring,"A good book to put someone to sleep. It can be read in about a day, if that is what you are looking for. It barely predicts anything but it certainly points out some past precedents that have future implications.A good book for Geography or Urban Planning Majors."
3,Adorable!,"These are so sweet! My daughter loves them!They are a bit hard to finish, because everythings so small.You really do need alot of patients to create with these, but it is worth it."
1,Only for those with an Engineering Degree,"Save your money, these bracelets are almost impossible to put together."
3,Review--Dark Lady,"Of interest mainly for the author's possibly being Shakespeare's mistress--the poems are dated, and often colorless; they are, however, emblematic of much of the verse of the time. The introduction makes a fair case for Lanier as the famous Dark Lady."
4,Big Show Review,"Short Review: Overall this documentary is very well done, because its just an hour long it feels just about right. We get to see some great highlights from his career and get an insight into the life of a Giant. Though his size may have gotten him through the door and a run in WCW, he has a lot of talent that isn't because of his size. Big Show can play the big bad monster as well as being the funny gentle giant. I enjoyed watching this video and seeing his greatest moments but learning a little more about him, people compare him to Andre the Giant but he is very different to him and that is because of his personality."
3,The Giant,"I liked this dvd, a biography of the big show, however i think they should have spent more time on his wcw matches and his time in that organization. A little to much time was spent on promoting the knucklehead movie, which was not why i viewed this dvd, i could really care less about that. So that bring a 60 minute biography on the big show down to about 50 minutes, it goes down to about 40 minutes if you don't really care about the floyd mayweather match. This dvd could have been alot better. Rent this one instead of buying it."
5,BIG SHOW AND BIG WINS,"I have bought many wrestler specific dvd's over the years, most I have rated three stars or less, this is a five star dvd no doubt about it. Most of the time when I buy a dvd about one of my farvorite wrestlers the match selection is terrible because which ever wrestler it may be the Undertaker for example wins about half of the matches on the dvd. Another negative about wrestler dvd's is too many of the matches are of little or no importance. The Big Show A Giants World does not have these problems, as this dvd has the best match selection I have ever seen, and The Big Show actually wins most of the matches (18-3-1). The matches on this dvd are also some of the most important of The Big Show's career these include, 5 world title wins, 2 world tag team title wins, 1 united states title win, and some successful title defences. If your a Big Show fan this is must have dvd. If I could I give it ten stars."
2,Short Story for a Tall Man,"This dvd is a disappointment. I'm not a huge fan of The Big Show, but I enjoy the quality of the biography features that the wwe puts out. This dvd lowers the quality a tad. The biography is barely passable and is far too short. It only lasts about 58 minutes. Most clock in 1:40 to 2 hours. They only spend about 10 minutes on Big Show's WCW run, skipping over a lot of his feuds. They spend too much time talking about Knucklehead. They also skip over a lot of Big Show's feuds in the WWE focusing way too much time on the Show/mayweather feud. Some of the matches on the dvd are good. They serve, mainly, as a nostalgic glimpse into the past. The later matches aren't as good. I hope this is not a new trend in wwe dvds."
2,Waste,"Has no structure, no step by step, just a collection of loosely related chapters, better to get ""Mystery Method"" that is the real deal."
4,good compilation,"Very good overview of the whole process, especially the mindset required. I agree with a previous reviewer that it is ""only"" a summary of fastseduction.com posts but it is a very good summary. There is much value in a single book that compiles hundreds or thousands of random pieces of information.Basically, no one book is good enough. You need about ten different books to find the approach and style that works best for you."
1,Not entirely original...,"Actually everything in the book IS helpful, and a OK read... but most of the material is FREE on the net already.The stuff from ""The Layguide"" was mirrored on all kinds of websites all over the place before it ever became print. If you search for keywords like ""layguide"" and ""player guide"" on the net, you will find this stuff is basically plagaurized. It was just a compilation of a bunch of usenet posts.Now, if you really want something in print, and original too, do yourself a favor now and go buy ""The Art of Seduction"" by Robert Greene, also available here on Amazon.com. The guy researched great seducers and seductions throughout history, and came up with types of seducers, the stages of seduction, etc. And his work is entirely original as well."
1,Dont buy this book,"All the material on this book can be found on the internet with more info!All this book is is just collected material from a site, then published on a book. Tony prob did not write any of it on his own. Not only that, this book is missing alot of key ingredients that will help anyone on their entire game. I suggest that if you are intrested in the sort of material taht this book has to offer, do a search on the net, you will find something that is usefull down the line, and more people who share your reactions..."
1,Doesn't deliver what is promised,"Well I got the book excited to read and get some chicks. guess what? I read the whole book and nothing has happened yet. You might probably say that I suck. Let me tell you that this book does.I would not recommend this book to anyone out there. Don't waste you time and hard earned money on this. I don't really wanna write a big review because I don't really care what was in the book, because it's all none-sense."
1,"Just as ""Why Love Men Bitches"" but for guys","This book is depressing, is Just as ""Why Love Men Bitches"" but for guys.These books damage a lot to the world right now, because it turns us into machines rather than human beings"
2,Some reasonable advice.,"I like the book but its a bit over the top in places.There is some good advice and if used sensibly is okay.Its a good book.I recommend these,also available from this site:1)""U.S.S.""(Undercover Sex signals"")By Leil Lowndes.2)""How to pick up girls!"" By Eric Weber.3)""How to meet the right woman"" By Roger Ratcliff,David Conaway & Diana Ohlsson.4)""How to pick up(get dates with)beautiful women:secrets every man should know"".By John Eagan,B.A.5)""Understanding women:The definitive guide to meeting,dating and dumping,if necessary.By Romy Miller."
3,Not the best but decent for the price,"I've read everything on the subject of seduction. SO its hard for me to view books as someone who is reading it for the first time. I've also read hundreds of articles on seduction and posted the best of them on my website The Seduction Bible. So lets just say, im educated. THat being said:This book is good if you've never read anything else. It's good if you don't want to spend the $40 it takes to purchase an E-book with more practical information. It does give you some great points in attitude, appearance, and general perspective of women. But it is missing the meat. It is missing the precise art of the mystery method. or the pure logic of cocky/funny.But then again... Like i said I've long since needed to read these books and now only read them to review for the readers of my site, the seduction bible.Bobby Rio"
1,This is HORRIBLE! Follow this if you want to get cold cocked!,"Seriously, I bought this for my 20 year old son to completely embarrass him. Well he refused to take it so it sat in the backseat of my car. My friend from out of town (who I was carting around the city doing touristy stuff) picks it up and starts reading it out loud to all of us. It says such horrible bad bad BAD advise. If you follow this guide you will be slapped. NO DOUBT. And possibly knocked out, depending on who you approach. This is from 2 chicks and one dude who are very open minded. You will NOT get anything other than a fat lip if you do even ONE of the things it tells you to do. So actually i think this should be in the comedy section. My kid is pretty smart *gloating*.I can't believe IDIOTS are following this advice and giving it good reviews! Ridiculous!"
1,True Author?,"Has anyone questioned why this information, word for word, is available for free on the web? From what I have read elsewhere it seems the true authors of this material have not granted permission to have their work reprinted here. But I could be wrong."
5,More than any website,"I've read the websites, and I've read this book, and I have to tell you the book is better. It's easier to read (duh) plus it has stuff that I've never seen on ANY any web site. Not to mention that you have to reread and study this information if you want it to work--and that's way easier with a book than on a screen."
2,Read The Art of Seduction instead,"This is amateur stuff. If you want to get really useful and ground-breaking stuff, read The Art of Seduction:[...]I know that it's long and a bit academic in tone, but it is the last word on Seduction in the modern age. True seduction is not just a one-shot, get-laid-tonight approach (although it can certainly include that). Read The Art of Seduction, and you will be well on your way to having women desire you to a degree that is truly shocking. I am a true believer, and I owe the author Robert Greene a debt that cannot be repaid. It is mind-boggling how much women really want to be carried away by their desire. Arm yourself with an understanding based on Greene's book, and you'll be well on your way."
4,A Good Intermediate Book,"I've read tonnes of these books now, attended seminars on pick up, bought dvd's and even paid for private tuition so I don't consider myself a newbie at pick up anymore.The Layguide is certainly one of the better books out there on pick up. It's funny with some real laugh out loud moments.The one critique I could give this book is that if you're starting out in pick up then you're probably going to want something on actually approaching women or girls. Getting over your ""approach anxiety"" is the first step and should be taken care of before you try to become an expert! For this, the best book I've read by far isDestroy Approach Anxiety - Effortlessly Approach Women Without Fear. But after you get over your initial fear of actually approaching women then The Layguide is one of the books you should read to give you some more intermediate advice and tricks.Recommended!"
4,GREAT PRICE,"What a great price for this item. It fit as advertised. The only thing that keeps me from giving it a 5 star rating is battery life; it's not as extended as I'd like, but better than the standard OEM version."
3,Motorola E815 extended life 1400mAh battery with cover,Cover and battery work fine but the life of the battery is no better than the 1000mAh battery that I had been using.
4,Motorola E815 Lithium-Ion Battery (w/cover),"It a very good addition to the phone, no need to worry about extended functions or short battery life."
1,"Grab a couple, mine was a dud",Grab a couple of batteries. Mine was a dud after 2 months. It would not charge. Battery seems slightly better than the original. (While it lasted)
2,Not quite as good as the real moto battery,This extended life battery is not quite at good as the REAL Moto battery but it will do! For the price and the limited time I willuse it it will suffice
5,Great for the price.,"These Batteries are worth the money. They are cheap and you will not go wrong.I did have a problem with 2 of the 4 I bought, but it is minor. The Batter Indicator will not show up and is showing ""Invalid Battery"". It works fine, sometime the indicator will work and sometime it will not. I can get a good 4 days out of it with no problems."
2,Bad Battery,"I expect the Ultra Extended Lithium-Ion Battery (1400mAh) a better battery than the original one that came with the phone, but it is not.The talk time is only about an hour. Since it is a brand new battery,I would think it will give me better performance. I am disappointed.The postage is too high."
4,motorola 815 lithium battery,the battery works! 2 days of use and still fully charged but my use is probably a little less than average. only minus is its slightly increased bulk.
4,Well worth the money,"I have a Motorola E815 phone approaching 4 years old and the original battery was only lasting about a day. I had heard that a new battery would cost me about the re-up price for a new phone from Verizon. Since my life is quite transitional now, I really didn't know what phone I wanted or needed, hence when I found this battery for less than $10 delivered I thought it was worth the shot. I think I ordered it on Friday and it was in the mail Monday, much faster than I expected. The battery and the new back still fits within my leather case, and it gives probably four days with moderate use. More usage cuts it down, but I still get a couple of days before it needs to be recharged."
3,Make sure it is new,"I got this for my daughter on Xmas and it was a used book, which has drawings in it. I would suggest only buying this as brand new, which I did not notice it was used at purchase."
5,Very Good Read on 8th Air Force B-24 Missions,"I really enjoyed this book. I have read several autobiographies and accounts of aerial combat in the ETO and this is one of the best. The author describes his experiences in details that kept me aware of what was going on and how he felt.Also, it was a great read about the ""other"" bomber in the ETO, i.e. the B-24 Liberator.Thanks Keith!"
3,Great for a few years,"I bought this trainer a few years ago and spend the winters riding about 7 hours per week on it. The noise level was GREAT for the first few years, but it has recently gotten much louder and is almost impossible to hear any TV/DVD audio once riding it. My guess is that most trainers get louder after a lot of use, but I'm looking to replace it after a few years of use due to the noise issue."
3,Slowly gets louder and louder,"When I first started using the trainer I could not understand the comments made about the noise as right out of the box it is very quite and I could easily hear the TV, music, my kids, etc. However, I have now put about 30 hours and about 500 miles on it and it is LOUD. The wheel makes a loud clicking noise that progressively gets worse. When I watch the TV while I ride on the trainer the TV slowly gets turned up until my wife comes in and asks why the TV is so loud. I rated this 3 stars because it is average which is unfortunately what I expected. I did not want to spend the money on a fluid trainer so I got the Magneto based on reviews and recommendations. I do not regret buying this and I would do it again, but I have been on cheaper trainers that are this loud as well."
1,loud and terrifying,This product was awful. It was so loud my pregnant neighbor thought the boiler in our building was going to blow up. It almost scared her into labor! I couldn't use it!
3,Not as good as I'd hoped,"I really thought I'd like this book, but I actually found it very hard to finish. I just didn't care about the characters (with the exception of Luke, the brother, whose sections were more interesting than the others). The author is definitely talented, but for me this book just didn't connect."
3,Can Relate To This Book,"I enjoy reading books about mental health issues, as I am a long-time sufferer of depression. This was very believable, but I did have trouble keeping track of the characters. Also, at times it the story did seem to drag a bit."
4,Powerful and only slightly predictable,"The author's use of language is lovely. The story takes you through loops to learn of one family's love and life.Despite some tough topics, the book is enjoyable. I really felt a kinship with all members of the family by the end of the book and recommend it for anyone looking for something more than a typical 'beach read.'"
5,Vivid,"This is an amazing novel containing unforgettable scenes in unexpected places: Angie as a high-schooler at a keg party in a field, her father ice-skating on a frozen river, her brother and his girlfriend attending a family wedding in Iowa. Funny, convincing, and gripping."
4,Interesting Story of Mental Illness,I enjoyed this book. I liked the way that the story was told in different perspectives. It was interesting to see how the main character's mental illness affected her brother and parents. I would recommend this book to anyone!
2,"Very real, but VERY depressing!","Yes, this book was good in that it seemed to accurately portray the breakdown of a family when one of its members actually ""breaks down"".However, it is an extremely depressing book in that no one seems to get any better. Angie floats around, mostly in a paranoid state, in and out of hospitals, group homes and her own home. Luke leaves college, leaves his girlfriend, drifts around for a while, then gets back with his girlfriend and goes back home (doing what, I'm not sure - the book wasn't clear on that). Pieter keeps playing his cello and wallowing in self pity. And Jordana never fully copes or even comes to term with Angie's illness. She is also drifting.This may be reality, but it is an extremely depressing reality. I have read ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" and loved it. This book is NOTHING like ""Cuckoo Nest""."
4,A mother of an album.........,"""A mother of an album"" -- I read an interview a while back w/ Laura where she talked about the process of writing the songs for 'mother's spiritual.' When I consider that she would typically wake up in the middle of the night, after probably a stressful day of child rearing or what have you, and jot down lyrical snippets on the back of matchbooks (or sometimes even her hand), it's easy to see how it turned out to be such a mellow record..... sort of a peaceful refuge after the craziness of the day. When I think about the album in those terms, I tend to appreciate it to its fullest, and sometimes even consider it one of Laura's greatest achievements. Oftentimes, the melodies of 'spiritual' (if not the complete songs) will fly through my head for no reason at the strangest times........ maybe not as often as the blaring horns of 'dark mornings,' the gypsy trumpet of 'i am the blues' or the double guitar thrush at the end of 'my innocence,' but often enough."
4,Mother's Spiritual is the Motherlode,I've been waiting to here this entire record for some time. It a was recorded after a break from the music business to have a child. Some of her earlier works went on to become bigger hits by other artists. I can't see anyone doing a better job than Laura did on these tunes. Todd Rundgren has been influenced by Laura since the late 60's and comes on board to help produce and play on some the songs. Great from start to finish. I'm so glad this record has finally been re-released so it can be enjoyed by those who may have missed it the first time around.
2,"For anyone else, 4 stars. For Laura, it's her nadir.","Wishywashy cause-proclamation from a once brilliant tunesmith and vocalist. It's okay to buy into feminism, tree-hugging and wicca in one's personal life, but to create an album on a major label about this stuff, to slow and barely tuneful music is a major mistake. If you're unfamiliar with Laura Nyro, this is not the place to begin. Try ""Eli and the Thirteenth Confession,"" ""The First Songs"" or pretty much anything else. Leave this one for Gloria Steinem or the next PETA convention."
1,Proof of a failing higher education system,"Which ""elite"" eastern college gave this hack a degree?Here's a great way to waste a weekend:Pick up something by Mona Cheren, browse through Jane Fonda's biography, and add in some tripe from Ann Coulter off the overstock table.Think of it as bulemic dilitants on parade..."
2,Silly And Too Simplistic,"The author is not in danger of doing-good with this book. This book is hard-to-read even if you are a ""red-stater."" This book does not look for a moderate middle-road. It focuses on a few problems with liberal politics and ignores the problems with right-wing politics and doesn't look to the middle where most of the solutions lie."
1,One of the worst spokeseman for my party..,"Let this illogical hack please not defend my party, and makea case against the liberals. She doesn't get it, and makesso many ridiculous arguments that don't hold up.Her writing style is horrendous. Please do not wastetime on this book. I would give this rating a negative 2 starsif I could."
5,Well-earned great reviews,"These folks have earned great reviews and deserve them. They are prompt, and their product is ""as advertised"" or better."
4,"excellent, but there's a catch","The 5 video set, ""Building Big"" with David Macaulay is an excellent overview of human's accomplishments in building. If you appreciate architecture, and especially if you are endeavoring to raise a youngster's awareness of this art form, this video set is something you'll want to own so that you can keep going back to it periodically. It explains in clear and vibrant terms how and why our structures are made the way they are. The catch is the 6th video - which is what is meant by ""educational curriculum"". At the end of each of the original 5 videos in this set, there is a section for children with activities for you to build small scale examples (bridges, domes, tunnels, dams and skyscrapers) to learn in a hands-on way the principles involved. The 6th video is simply a repeat of this material. The 6th video - ""Building Big and Thinking Small"" should be sold separately."
1,Too small,"This bath was too narrow. I paid $1,400 for the bath and could not use it as it was too small. It is in my grage and no one wants to get it even for free."
4,i like it but wish it would get more acoustic tracks,I listen to Neil hamburger especially in his more upbeat types. i do prefer the more mellow music sometimes with guitar but the Malaysia is the best yet
3,It's all over for Neil Hamburger,"Although this is a Neil Hamburger album (by defenition awesome ), it is Hamburgers weakest to date. The only thing left is for him to do an album where he is having a nervous breakdown."
2,Ehhh - it's ok I supose,My roommate had one that was brand new in which I left water at a bowl in the pot for maybe 10 minutes and the water alone cooked away the protective layer inside the pot and stained it white. Since the pot was not mine I had to replace it at $60. I would have never paid that much if it were for myself.
5,Better than swiffer,"I have had no problems with swiveling the mop head, as another review had suggested. It does a fantastic job of dry mopping the kitchen floors, and wet mopping worked extremely well. Just some generic pine-scented cleaner, hot water, and the mop pad. When I'm done, I just toss the mop pad in the wash with the towels and it's ready to use again. Great for the environment and great for your wallet."
5,microfiber mop,"This product is fantastic. For dusting, pollen, dog hair and everything else on the floor or walls this is the go to mop. Very wide head and mop head adheres to handle by velcro. Washes beautifully."
2,Disappointed,I am disappointed with the mop. It has been ackword for me to handle. The pad just swivels round and round as I try to get into corners or just move in a straight line. Not as all what I was expecting.
3,poisoned pens,"mean of me to give this three stars, but I think it's what Paul Heaton would have wanted, perverse curmudgeon that he is.It's possibly their best album too - before the bitter (and often violent) lyrics entirely overwhelmed the honey-soaked tunes, alienating his co-singer Biana Corrigan and losing a large part of the charm of the group. The highlights are superb (utterly British) soulful pop songs, heartfelt, heartbroken and wry - A Little Time and, most of all, Let Love Speak Up Itself. However, you can get these gems on the best of, as did the majority of the British record buying public.There's obvious filler material that drags down the level of the album, (I've Come for my Award), but it's something about the black heart of this album that makes listening to it less aural joy, more Joy Division. Maybe that's no bad thing."
3,Cemetery Junction,"This is a very good film. But if you're buying it because you are a Ricky Gervais fan be aware that his presence on screen is rather limited. Set in 1970's England, in a small working class town, the dialog is sometimes difficult to understand but not overly so. I found the acting to be agreeable and at times admirable, especially from the veteran actors Emily Watson and Ralph Fiennes. The younger actors were very good as well. For me though, what made this movie stay with me was the soundtrack by Tim Atack. As the Dude would say, 'it really tied the room together.'"
3,Been done before and better,"I watched this because of the names Gervais and Merchant and while it wasn't a bad movie, it's hard to recommend as there's not really anything in it that you haven't seen done before elsewhere and better. It feels like the co-writers/co-directors really wanted to show that they could break out from comedy and make a coming-of-age story with dramatic resonance, but what they came up with feels like a semi-serviceable imitation of other, better movies. It might have been heartfelt, but as what we're accustomed to seeing from them is exceptional, seeing something that is little more than ""fine"" compounds the letdown. Three stars because Ralph Fiennes and Matthew Goode are really great in it."
5,"A masterpiece, pure and simple. Buy it.","Gervais and Merchant prove that their combined Midas touch works as well on the big screen as the small. I had tears in my eyes from laughing so much it hurt, and also because they just know how to create those emotionally poignant moments between characters that send shivers down your spine - as anybody who has seen episode 12 of 'The Office' and the Christmas Special of 'Extras' will already know. Everything about this film is perfect, and the soundtrack alone is worth the price of admission. Buy it, and love it."
3,Where all this started: pre-Thatcher UK,"It's 1973 and of reliable goods England was famous for before twentieth century some producing still exists in Cemetery Junction, a lumpen (working-class) bed-district serviced with trains every hour. Three school graduates of different tempers and behavioral patterns stick together contributing each other adds and odds, dreaming of leaving this god-forsaken place for some time at least.And the rest is story-telling one should watch personally."
1,Not as advertised (update: item's description has been revised),"Nice looking knife. However, the ""other products by Gerber"" in its title is misleading. This knife is not made by Gerber. Also, it is made in China.Update: the knife's title and description have been completely revised since I purchased this item and the information now appears to be accurate."
2,Item sent not the one pictured- beware!!!!!,I registered for two of these platters through amazon for our wedding. I received one for my bridal shower and what do you know.... it is NOT the one i wanted- but a completely different platter! the one i received has a wide rim and is a less elegant shape. it is exactly the one i didn't want- hence registering. This happened with the other wachtersbach products i registered for on amazon as well- not the same as the picture/ description. BEWARE.
4,waechterbach platter,wonderful customer service..initial platter shipped defective..second platter promptly shipped with no defects. very good quality
3,too shiny,"The Platter that I bought has a very shiny glaze which shows every little smudge or scratch. In fact, when I received it, there were tiny scratches on the surface. They are invisible if there is food on the plate but I think with use, these scratches will increase and become more noticable. Every little fingerprint shows: you would have to handle it with soft gloves or potholders in order for that not to happen. This may not be true with the colors other than black which is what I bought."
1,Depends on your situation,"I bought this along with the authors' grammar reference, which has proven an expensive mistake. The two are college level texts and probably quite good for those engaged in intellectual pursuits. I, on the other hand, teach ESL as a volunteer and was simply looking to shore up my practical knowledge of the subjects. Both texts contain virtually no such information. In fact, they assume a significant knowledge of linguistics and linguistic theory; they are literally packed with obscure jargon that I presume familiar to some set of initiates but certainly far beyond my ken. If your situation is analogous to mine, I suggest Side by Side Spanish & English Grammar and Practice Makes Perfect English Pronouns and Prepositions--much less expensive ($30 the pair I think) and much more practical."
2,"Some theory, Some technique.","Why am I not surprised that there is much debate amongst researchers on how best to teach English pronunciation? And why so much argument about the best way to produce native-like speech when the author practically concedes that it is nearly impossible? I can't use this overlong overpriced book in my ESL class unless I threaten to hit students over the head with it when they use 'r' instead of 'l'.I changed my review because the book has some teaching techniques. But here are still many flaws. It has a modified phonetic system which doesn't make sense, and it places too much emphasis on minor pronunciation details. There are better texts out there."
2,Not What I Expected,"This book is definatly not what I expected. I wanted to increase my awareness of the English pronunciation rules in order to help me to be able to teach the subject more effectively. However, the book seems to be designed for students of speech pathology. It is more concerned with explaining complicated linguistical terms, which are of little or relevance to a regular ESL/EFL classroom teacher."
1,Teaching Pronunciation,"I expected this bookTeaching Pronunciation: A Reference for Teachers of English to Speakers of Other Languagesto be more helpful for my needs as a current EFL teacher. However, the text is written more for a college level linquistic class of future ESL/EFL teachers."
4,they work just fine,"It came quickly in a small enough package to fit in our apartment mailbox. Cheap price, good product. They aren't packaged for the US, I think they're from another country. But they fit just fine and my picky husband likes them well enough. PLus they were much much cheaper than buying from the grocery store. Good buy for sure."
4,3 blades that shave your face... or whaterver.,"The razor blades arrived only two days after I ordered them. The box and blades seemed a little bit cheaper than what I would buy in the store, but they work just fine. The cartridge fits onto my existing handle and provides a smooth shave. Seems like a good deal to me considering what they cost at the grocery store."
5,"Wow, now thats a shave!!!","Clearly the mach 3 is better than the rest, more is not always better dude, the mach 3 is like.......well, it's like one of those sleeper razers. You know, your like getting ready to shave and in your mind your thinking, ""Three blades? this can't possibly...WHOA!, what the heck was that?"" Well Mr., that there was a quality mach 3 shave."
4,a good enough shave,they do the trick. i cant believe razor blades in general are so expensive but this package is not a bad deal. i use each blade about 15 times before i replace them although they do dull out after about 8. but i am a very frugal and poor person so i cannot afford to replace them like a prince. overall though a good value.
4,These still work great-no need for 5 blades that I see,"These still work great-no need for 5 blades that I see. I use these with the newer vibrating handle, they give a nice close shave and cost much less that the newer ones..."
4,"Works just fine, but not cheap at all","I get 4-5 shaves with each razor, after that it causes pimples. I find it too expensive, but there is no better alternative."
1,Not true MACH 3 Cartridges,"It took 12 days for the cartridges to arrive. I have been using a Mach3 since they were released. These blades look like Mach3 blades and come in a box for Mach3 replacement blades, but they must be counterfeit. I had to put my old blade back on my razor until I can go buy replacements at the local drugstore. Save your money, a single blade razor is far better than what is being peddled here"
1,these are either seconds or bootleg merch... do not buy.,"I unfortunately bought a bunch of these as well, and even though they are packed in Gillette packaging (foil printing and all!)... they are not the real deal.As a longtime Mach 3 user and head shaver... I can tell you without a doubt that these are discards or bootlegs.The ""gel strip"" is fake or poorly done and the blades are not very sharp, which resulted in me, unhappy and bleeding.I sent a pack to Gillette, waiting for their reply. Contacted seller... no response.buyer beware."
4,Heavy and big but do a great job,I needed to carry 4 bikes on a camping trip so I purchased this 2 bike extension. It is as solid and easy to use as the main bike carrier it was added to. Once the heavy lifting is done and this rack is in your hitch your bikes snap in and out with ease. I nicked it one star because it is a bit heavy and perhaps a lighter metal alloy could have been used when manufacturing these.
3,The heat lingers,"Based on the other two reviews I was expecting more of a classic sweet and savory experience. My experience with these was that the spice overwhelms the sweet, while the salty is almost too faint to notice. The heat from the chili spice lasts way too long for a product advertising itself as sweet and savory. These really are more of a spiced nut than sweet and savory. If you like heat with a trail that lasts for minutes, this is your product. If you don't, try something else."
2,GREAT Customer Service; but this clog isn't so great,"I purchased these clogs for my daughter for Christmas, having purchased other types of Betulas in the past and having been very happy. The material these are made out of is just not great. The clogs arrived lookig like someone had already worn the suede off around the edges. It just isn't good material if you want your shoes to stay looking nice for very long. I would recommend the leather Betulas... those can stay looking nice and you can at least polish them. Skip the suede!This company has wonderful customer service, and I would purchase from them again. Nice return policy!"
5,it's all good,I was hesitant about the size chart because I ordered as a gift but I had no problems.
2,return problems,Shoes were great but needed different size. Return was lost for sometime but finally found. Big hassle!
5,Fantastic Products,The clogs are perfect. They are very comfortable and the color is exactly what I wanted.
2,Somehow not as good as Birks,"They run MUCH smaller than Birkenstocks. I sent the size 44 back (which is comfy in the comparable model in Birkenstocks; is it the Boston?) and got the 45 and it STILL feels small. The upper is ok, the shoe isn't the best made thing but is adequate; it's just the size thing that bothered me."
2,Read the small print before you buy,I ordered these as a gift. I had to pay about $7 shipping. They did not fit the recipient. I did not know about the 15 day return policy or the 15% restocking fee. Now I owe more shipping (must be insured) and the fee. That is a total loss of about $23 for nothing. And I ordered these early to beat the Christmas rush. Now I have one day left to return them - Christmas Eve. Read the small print. I will not buy from a company that sells through Amazon again.
4,Reviews really helped!,"I wanted something beachy looking to cover my thighs that wasn't skintight. After reading the reviews, I was comfortable enough to make the purchase and I'm glad I did. It's adorable and so easy to manage! Came quick, too! Def recommend."
5,A most inspiring story by a most courageous woman,"The story begins when Ruth Bohle, a young American woman falls in love with a young German businessman. She moves to Germany, marries and starts a family. And lives in Berlin during WWII.Through Ruth's eyes, we experience the wartime hasrdships of raising children with coal-gas-food rationing, daily bombing, family separations, foot and train travel, a husband who becomes severely wounded, homelessness, and fear as an American in Germany.We also see the goodness of family, friends and strangers...and how important this is to Ruth's survival through continued adversity.Ruth is the glue that holds her family together during those difficult and emotional times.Ruth's account is REAL!!...Real people, Real feelings, Real war...experienced by a Real American wife and mother.A wonderful read -- the absolutely best book I have read in many years."
5,Amazing - Motivates kids to eat healthy and be more active!,"How many ways are there to get our children to read, eat healthy, and be more active? Answer - NONE, until I found Race Against Junk Food. The story is wonderful, action packed but non-violent, and it gently moves a child's belief system into a mode that encourages a healthy lifestyle. What could be better? Read it with your child and see if you don't become more active and eat more fruits and vegetables (and leave that couch & cheeseburger behind)."
2,fun but not a lot of teaching substance,"My kids liked the story but there was only one page that really focused on teaching good nutrition. Smoking cigaretes is introduced in the book also. I think that should be addressed under the drugs topic, not nutrition. I'm sure there are better resources for teaching kids about nutrition."
1,Disappointing,"I can't believe that other reviewers gave this book 5 stars. I was completely disappointed. The book included very little useful information to help kids make good nutritional choices- ""fruits and veggies are awesome"" was about the extent of it. The text is uninteresting and cumbersome to read aloud, and the illustrations are not appealing. I am returning this book."
5,Awesome candy snack,"Unfortunately I can't see to get these for some reason, but when I did try some samples around Christmas, they were super. I have been looking for a store that sells them without any luck. I hear I can get them from Japan, but at what price?"
4,On a plain level,This video is ok. I enjoyed the fact that its a black couple. I can relate to that. I like the tape.
2,Not for modern skis,"A major problem with this rack is that it won't fit skis wider than 3 "" (89 mm) at the mounting point. As the bindings must be placed between the racks, this means that the width of the skis in front of the front binding and behind the rear binding must be less than that size. In my experience, that eliminates of modern alpine or tele skis.XC skis would work fine, as would (1) snowboard.Other than this major concern, the magnets seem to hold securely & rack is of good construction. I do have concerns on the longevity of the plastic, especially in cold weather - it does not appear to be fiber-reinforced."
2,Limited Use - Missing Warnings,"This product appears to be well designed. However, when you get it you find that there are numerous (21 to be exact) warnings and cautions not mentioned online. Some are obvious but others severely limit its use. Max speed (55 mph on the box, 65 mph in the instructions)and cannot be used with sun roof are two biggies. I returned the item without trying it because of all the limitations"
4,good piece of collection,"This video reflects the early years of Pink Floyd. In that time a bunch of innovative guys, mainly Syd probably because his use of sychedelic stuff, trying to bring something new in terms of music. If you are a real fan this would be very rare and interesting but if you expect the late sound of PF with Waters and Gilmour maybe you will feel quite shocked. I rated it 4 because is a short document and the sound is not the best although for this kind of information this is not important, the real value of video is to see them in the context of a very important moment in the history of pop music."
4,For 'Die-hard fans' only --also beware in PAL not NTSC.,"I purchased this tape in Nov.2000.At first I was disappointed because the copy sent to me was in PAL format , then I purchased a multi-format VHS VCR so that I could exchange tapes with relatives abroad.The seuences 'echo' a favored time . Not particularly interesting musically but a historical 'gem'.I transferred it to NTSC format; then the soundtrack to Cassette & CD (with 'Synthesized stereo/Surround' sound ,as the tape is Monophonic). Recently I've made a DVD+R transfer ,since a 'commercial' release isn't available. Good stuff - for fans!!Edd.iegolden@shaw.ca"
1,Made me sad...,"I just don't get it. A just-barely-OK lengthy take of ""Interstellar"" with footage including some weird (not at all in a good/interesting way...I mean weird that anyone decided that it was relevant to the Floyd) faux-psychedelic documentary about London circa '66/'67 interspersed with precious few live clips (again, not that bomb...some footage finds PF looking about as enthused as a kid in church) and you have this perplexingly disappointing release. This is almost bootleg level in terms of editing quality and intention as a piece of art but that besmirches the good name of the better quality bootlegs I've enjoyed in my life. This so totally sucks and was probably only vaguely authorized by the band. It certainly seems designed to slip into the ""gimme everything"" filterless, fanboy bloodstream. Which is a shame. Don't waste your money. Even if you're hardcore...it just might make you angrier..."
3,Rare footage,"This film won't win awards for musical content or cinematography but for sheer historical value it is a ""must have"" for any Pink Floyd fan. The best parts of the film are the segments with the legendary Syd Barrett, the reclusive genius that inspired the band in the early years."
4,Good book!,"Although this book does point out some amusing inconsistencies and changes between episodes, some are a bit TOO ""nit-picky."" For instance, who cares why Mulder & Scully don't use flashlights in certain instances? Anyway, I love the plot summaries and other factoids the book gives."
4,New coffee table book!,"I keep my copy next to my tv-guide, that way I can look for the nit picks! Actually it is a good book, but it does tend to distract you from the episode."
5,Great book!,This is a must have for all x-philes like me! I love this book! this one is so awesome! I always make sure I have it when watching and old X-Files rerun!buy it!
4,I saw the book and I had to have it!,"I became a fan of The X-Files after season three, and have been hooked since. I am also a fan of Star Trek, so I was familiar with the whole ""Nit Picking"" idea, and found it fun and hilarious. So of course I bought the companion to my favorite show - The X-Files. I read it as I watched the episodes I had on tape and kept saying to myself, ""I knew there was something wrong there!"" I truly enjoyed the book, and I nit pick the new episodes every Sunday night. I hope Mr. Farrand can finish seasons 5-8 and the movie!"
3,more annoying than fun...,"This book definitely has its good points. The extra features (trivia, quotes, tote boards, etc.) are very enjoyable and should suit any X-phile's tastes. The overall purpose of the book, however, is really quite bothersome. I frankly don't want to know every single place where the creators or actors screwed up. I think it's kind of fun to see an oddity while watching the show and poke a little fun, but that's as far as I'm willing to go. The author also seems to a bit wacky and, as others have said, puts too much of his own opinion into the book. If you're a perfectionist or you're willing to buy the book just for the extras, go ahead and get it. Otherwise, it's not worth it."
2,Rust,"The outdoor fireplace is well equipted with a rack and a trough. My one comment is that it rusted almost immediately and had to be spray painted with special heat resistent paint. We like the idea of an outdoor fireplace. It also looks very caldron like and midevil. Not very 2007.More functional, and I would like to say practical, but the engineering in design isn't that good. All in all, not worth the $180 some odd money it cost."
5,Ethnography with tables of offsets!,"I hunted this book down after seeing a beautiful ""rodney"" boat from New Foundland on the internet. I didn't realise it was an ethnography when I ordered it, but now that I have it I appreciate it for what it is. I enjoyed reading about the boats and the vanishing breed of men who built them. One of the things that makes this book so interesting is accounts of the use of archaic methods that result in very sound, beautiful, useful boats. The author does go into the building procedures and provide lines and offsets for a few boats."
5,Great author...great book...Top of the list!,"This guy is simply my best author of all time....I like his style. He gives me hope that there are people out there who make use of their hearts and brains in seeking after God. His books generally stimulate me to search beyond the usual all-so-familiar religious stereotypes. Larry is honest and clear. He has set his heart on pilgrimage and has drawn those of us who feel him towards the same road.I first read his book ""Inside Out"" about 10 years ago and since then, I buy every book he writes or has ever written. For some of his books, one needs to ""spiritually grow"" into them before you can actually comprehend his line of thought.Anything less than a five star would be an injustice to a man who has poured out heart and soul into seeking God and being honest!"
2,Just okay...,"I was really ready for whatever this author had to say. I was looking for content for a talk I had to give on biblical masculinity and femininity. I found enough material buried in the book to be useful, amidst many qualifiers and apologies. However, I found it almost impossible to find a truly coherent, let alone concise or powerful quote. That was disappointing! If you are going to posit something, be brave and posit it boldly! If you aren't right, then there is no need to say it. And if you are right, say it boldly so we can understand why it is important. I happen to think he is on to something. Just wish he had said it better."
1,"Five star songs, 1 star mastering--it's a pity that someone didn't bother to remaster this AGAIN","Squeeze was a terrific band and the band does deserve an exceptional anthology with some b-sides thrown into the mix as well.This isn't it.The song selection is terrific.The b-sides are good--there are a couple here that shouldn't have been on this reissue as they've appeared elsewhere but, again, it's a pretty good selection of b-sides on the second disc.The problem is the mastering.It's loud. It's superloud and horribly compressed.It's headache inducing loud.There wasn't any credit in the booklet noting who did the remastering here probably because they're ashamed. They should be.Avoid this. Save your money. Oh, for those who picked upBig Squeeze: The Very Best of Squeeze""Gold"" is a straight reissue of that release."
2,Don't over cook!,"I had just received this Garlic roaster and couldn't wait to try it. I followed the directions and instead of putting in in the microwave for 5-6 minutes, I put it in for only 4 minutes. The smoke started pouring out of the microwave vent and the entire head of garlic was coal black and the roaster was ruined. A friend told me to try only 1 1/2 minutes and, although the roaster now has a burnt smell, I tried it for that time only. The garlic turned out soft and usable, except I will now have to replace the roaster with a new one. Whoever wrote the directions couldn't have been further off with the timing. Just be careful! I would probably cut down the oven time to 30 minutes instead of the recommended time, also."
5,Terra Cotta Garlic Roaster,I ordered this item so use in my microwave. It works perfectly and I am very very pleased with it.I would recommend this Roaster to my friends and family.
5,Terra Cotta Garlic Roaster,"Purchased this for my sister-in-law for Christmas and it is exactly what she was looking for. I was looking for a small one to use with one bulb of garlic, but this will be able to hold two, possibly three small bulbs of garlic."
3,Not so happy,"The actual item turned out to be okay, but the package came smashed up and the directions in the box look like they have been used well. This was supposed to be a new item. The speed of delivery was impressive, but I am not happy with the condition of the package. It was a Christmas present and it was embarrassing that I had to assure the recipient that the product had not been used."
1,Cover not glazed - becomes rancid,The base is glazed. The cover is not and quickly becomes infused with oil which then turns rancid. The whole thing smells like death.
3,Terra Cotta Garlic Roaster,"I ordered 4 of these for the most part that are very nice, but some have more glaze then others. I guess Ill see if that makes any difference?Progressive International Terra Cotta Garlic Roaster"
5,Windows Vista,It is so great that I want to install the Interactive Multimedia DVD in my new PC but seems it doesn't work with Windows Vista. Did anybody solved this problem?
1,disk doesnt work,"the very first disk was defective and i called the company and they told me ""tough"""
1,I have got two words to descibes what I thought of this...,"AND THAT IS BORING AND SNOBISH! I watched the first two hours of this and coudn't keep awake. The narritor's voice was monotone. I wanted to shout at his pompous, snobish demeanor SHUT UP!! In my opinion is not the proper way to educate is to entertain at all god's peoples. With the narritor, granted he is educated but does he have to shove his creditals and his attitude from the gecko. When you take people on a educating journey (such as nine hours long) invite them like you would invite into a warm a loving welcoming home. I felt with his demeanor and atitude felt beat up and like I was crawling on my hands and knees through out the first two hours. I am not watching the rest of the seven hours and returning this DVD set back to the library and saying ""Check Please""."
5,Excellent!,"This nine-part documentary is not only a history of the Jews, it's a history of the western world! Hundreds of thousands of dollars were probably spent in the production of this series. Abba Eban takes the viewer all over the world to examine one of the world's most gifted and intriguing people - the Jews. These tapes will not put you to sleep. The music and images allows the viewer to relive Jewish history. And consequently, come to understand the world we live in today much better. I know the tapes are pricey, but own this documentary if you ever have the chance. You'll never regret it."
5,Recommeded!!!,"It takes 9 hours to watch a complete set and it worths it. It interesting that my 6 years old daughter was watching some parts with me and we both enjoyed. There are a lot of reasons to watch the program. First, it gives a good overview of the western civilization from sumerians. Second, the quality of the material is superb. You'll see a lot of beautiful places around the globe. Third, you'll learn about the jews.Some things are quite surpising. The program is focused on dates, places and events. It tells you what happened and where but not much about why. Also it doesn't tell much jewish religion or traditions. If you want to know about jewish holidays, what kosher is etc, you'll need to look for other sources.Overall, it's a great history program!"
1,Update of the old book,"It was a rather frustrating book since it was just an update of the previous generation book for VC++ 6.0. It seems that SAMS wanted to be the first to sell in order to sell. This is rather bad for the company since it will lose many of its potential customers in the future. The only chapters worth reading, well at least a little bit, are chapters 19 and 21 and nothing more."
1,Useless book.,"Starting as a C and C++ pro, I was looking after a book to apply my knowledge to Windows using Visual C++. I came from other systems (unix...).Target : get all basics in order to shorten by beginner stage.For about a year, from a beginner to independant developper status, almost anything I was looking for in this book happened to be fruitless. Everytime the MSDN Help online from VC++ was much more helptful.Let me give a simple example :- you want to display a button with a bitmap. Nothing from the Index. You go to ""Adding controls to your application"" - none. ""Bitmaps..."" : nope.VC++ help : you go to the index, ""bitmaps"" a few lines below ""button"" and... you got it."
5,A fabulous soulful album!,"This album definately lived upto expectations. I also purchased some of the album for gifts and were received with great thanks, and the reivews I had back were very favourable. Definately worth buying!!"
5,Back where he belongs!,"It's taken him 26 years to produce a new album but it really is worth the wait! Always too good to be a side-man in my opinion, he has worked along side the likes of Eric Clapton, George Harrision & Roger Waters playing guitar but his marvellous distinctive voice has gone unheard for too long. This album is a breath of fresh air for those who like me are rather depressed at the lack of real music out there, Every track is strong and you can tell that he has worked very hard on producing such great lyrics. It's musically sweet alright and deserves to sell by the truck load. So buy it and buy your next door neighour a copy too!"
2,a bit misleading!,I got this book because when I did a google search on How to Make anna riva oils I was sent to this book! So I assumed with the way the title was worded that there would be recipes in this book! FYI folks their are *NO* recipes in this book!!!!the book is great for traditional use of these oils and thats it!!!
5,Golden Secrets of Mystic Oils: Over 550 Oils and 1300 Spells,Golden Secrets of Mystic Oils: Over 550 Oils and 1300 Spells is a great book by anna riva for her oils. A must have reference!
5,"I AM THE SINGER""S (jack russell) SON","THIS ALBUM IS THE BEST. IT'S GOOD FOR ANYONE (i'm 12). TELL YOUR FRIENDS, TELL YOUR ENEMIES."
4,good rocking album,"The album contains good ballads, rocking tunes, and introspective songs, not what you expect from a ""typical '80's metal"" band."
4,Glad they're back,This latest cd is very good. About the only negative thing that I can find to say about it is that it should have had a few less ballads & more kick ass songs on it like Rollin' Stoned. But all in all a good cd.
3,"""Can't Get There From Here by Great White""","I picked this up years ago after hearing ""Rollin' Stoned"" played on the radio when it first came out. I played the whole disc a few times but it did not do much for me, I think I was comparing it too much to their big hits from from the late 80s and early 90s. When I play it again now I see that it is better than I remembered but in my opinion still not great. There are some good songs on here, a few that I don't think really work that well, and nothing that really stands out to me. If you are new to Great White stick with their earlier stuff over this. If you are a big Great White fan and have never heard this it is probably worth picking up."
3,Average offering,"I was a bit disappointed with this album in the fact there were too many sleepy songs. I did like, however, Rolling Stoned and Wooden Jesus. However, this album, as a whole, lacks the energy that made Twice Bitten and Hooked such great albums."
3,Just didn't bring me back to the old days.,"I have been a huge Great White fan since I saw them live in 1990. When this album came out, I was going through some major withdrawls after the disppointment of Sail Away. I gave it a spin and yea, the opening track was that same old Great White, but the rest of the album let me down. Russell's vocals seemed strained and really showed his age. In my opinion, their last great album was Psycho City. It's a shame they're gone now, but maybe they will reform and play the great old stuff again."
5,One of their best if not their Best!!,What an incredible CD. First time through it I loved it. But as I listen to it more and more I feel that its probably their best Album yet. In my opinion this band is one of the best they have been around for awhile and continue on putting out great albums. Their style is just to sweet. Lets hope they keep the great albums coming. This CD offers their hard rocking style as well as their softer ballads.
4,What goes around comes around.,"Short and simple: This is really a good solid record from start to finish.It seems like the right time for bands like Great White to come back and do what they do best and not try to adapt to the current trends.Def Leppard and Dokken both failed on their last times at bat and now, sticking to their old formula, also have out records that should please their fans.Good work guys! Really great to hear some straight ahead rock and roll again."
5,Rock is back!,"This album smokes from start to finish!! The first single is killer ""Rollin' Stoned!!"" This could be one of Great White's best performances in years. Rock on guys!!"
3,Lacks Energy,This CD was not what I expected. There are too many mellow songs on it and it just doesn't catch my interest. There are a few good songs on it but not enough to keep me listening.
1,Thanks for Robbing Me of my Money,"I would just like to thank the Sinclair Institute for robbing me and the other 4 million people who bought their videos of our money.I cannot believe that someone would produce something that is this terrible.Let me save you some money. This video reveals no ""SECRETS"" to sex and no ""AMAZING"" positions. The Doctors that give the advice provide a lot of Medical Mumbo Jumbo.Let me save you some money. The video has bad actors filmed in a terrible setting. It looks like a bad 70s adult flick. Yes a 70s film. Nothing from this millennium that's for sure.As for an overall synopsis: Pay attention to your lover and try to satisfy them. Try different places and positions for sex. And oh yes, men and women love oral sex. Come on Sinclair, everyone knows that.Thanks but no thanks..."
1,Don't be fooled. Save your money.,"I purchased the Better Sex Videos with my boyfriend because we were looking for something new for our relationship. Well I purchased this DVD with their Sexual Positions For Lovers - Beyond the Missionary Position.What a mistake. When the DVD arrived I noticed that the couples are not attractive (turn off for both of us), the quality was terrible, and the information provided was basic information that everyone knows. As for the positions, they are general positions that anyone knows.This company claims that they have sold 4 million videos. I wonder how many returns they have gotten out of those 4 million.I would give this and the Sexual Positions For Lovers - Beyond the Missionary Position zero stars if I could. Don't be fooled. Save your money.If you are looking for a great sex position DVD, try: Sex Essentials Videos: Seductive Sex Positions. Also another great DVD (for the females out there) is Female Masturbation : Every Woman's Orgasm is Unique."
4,Roberto Deveraux a different view of Queen Elizabeth,"Roberto Deveraux presents England's Queen Elizabeth I in a different light than most English history books. The opera, written by Donizetti an Italian composer, portrays her as a woman starving for love and jealous for one man she thinks could love her. Beverly Sills presents a magnificent projection of her in this image. Her role is clearly a colorotura role and her voice, particularly in the closing aria, magnificently projects a woman lamenting her life. This opera is rarely performed in the US and I think this is so because of the plot rather than the music. A good buy and a good watch."
2,"bad video, poor sound","I can't hear the great Sills, I'll recommend her roberto in cd instead. Wolftrap has bed accoustics. I was there, and Sills was great. But the recording is badly miked. She sounds thin and can hardly be heard."
3,Shallow,"Eric Clapton's DVD is very shallow. Most Eric Clapton fans know about his background. If there was more of an in-depth musical biography with Eric Clapton narrating, it could have been a very interesting DVD.Eric Clapton - Masterpieces"
5,Legion,It as everything I thought it was I enjoyed very much. I like movies that I can watch more than once and still enjoy them
1,Legion: A Lesion on the movie industry!,"Terry Farrell, Rick Springfield, Parker Stevenson, Corey Feldman are the ""headline"" actors in this flat and slow moving Sci-Fi Channel exclusive. None of them are directed to their potential in this excuse of an ""Aliens"" wannabe. Poor storyline also contributes. Only buy this if you are a deranged fan of one of the actors and you want to throw away a hundred bucks."
4,Long Walk to Freedom,"Ever since their emergence on Paul Simon's Graceland, the unique harmonies and rhythms have kept me enthtralled. The notable thing about this CD is how their famous guests adapt to their sound, choice of material, and blend is solid. Some collaborations work better than others. Mellissa Ethridge and Natalie Merchant are two standouts. This a worthwhile introduction this group."
3,Long Walk to Freedom,The traditional African songs are beautiful. I'd like it better if it were all traditional African music. I wasn't too crazy about Simon and Garfunkle when they were popular so it sort of taints my view.
4,Decent but not great,This was a decent but not engrossing read. The charecters were just not that compelling and while the storyline was original in that it did not recycle the same naive miss for the zillionth time it lacked a certain spark. It's a bad bookjust not engrossing. Still it's a decent read with likeable if somewhat shallow charecters and a fresh story line.
5,Marvelous Characters,This is the first of Miranda Jarrett books that I have read and will definitely read others. She with a wonderful flair. Her love scenes are stirring and the interaction of the characters is very nice. Franceseca and Edward are definitely meant for each other.
5,Honest and Daring,"This wonderful book, about a relationhsip with one of the most mysterious and charismatic rock stars, is blatant in its honesty. Often, through her perfectly timed and wickedly dry sense of humor, Ms. Huddleston simultantouesly shows us her naivete in direct conflict with her alter ego which knows better than to think for a moment that Jim Morrison will actually rise to her girlhood-like expectations. Revealing in every way, funny and touching, I read this one straight through!!"
3,This is the End . . . My Only Friend: Living and Dying with Jim Morrison,"This is an ""OK"" book. It was short and was not as intimate of a look into Jim's life as what I had expected. I am an avid collector and reader of all things Jim Morrison and I have read many other books about him that I would read again, but, this book is not one of them. Val Kilmer said he used this book as his ""bible"" while filming the Oliver Stone movie ""The Doors"". I guess (to true fans and friends and people who were close to Jim) that is why this movie was not an accurate picture of The Doors and Jim Morrison. I would recommend this book only to a serious collector of all things Morrison, just to have it in their collection, but, not to someone who is looking to find out more about Jim's life, as a whole."
1,Beats sleeping pills!,"Oliver Stone is quoted on the cover for ""an extremely important book that put Jim Morrison into perspective for the film"". Really? Why? Of all he books I have om Jimbo and the Doors this one must be rated as the worst of them all. After putting it down, you don't know more about Morrison than before, so I wonder why Val Kilmer on the back of the book is quoted for "" the book was my bible for the film"". It's amazing that the author is able to recollect all the conversations she had with Morrison considering the hazed state she was in must of the time. Also, why isn't there any pictures of her and Morrison together. Where they really together more than a couple of times?Well, one good thing about my copy, I found it on sale for a few bucks, so that alone makes it worth the lone star."
2,"Lange QAndA: Radiography Examination, Seventh Edition (LANGE QAndA Allied Health)","Lange QAndA: Radiography Examination, Seventh Edition (LANGE QAndA Allied Health) wit a CDROM of the book, I did receive the book in excellent condition but prior to buying it said a CDROM was included in the purchase and I fell for it only to realize that it was only the hard copy.The main reason why I ordered this product was to download on my laptop to review during travel, airport wait and at my leisure or when helping out x-ray students at my job use it as a reference guide. Am very very unhappy about what I got b'cos a CD will be of much better use for me.Thanks"
5,The Only Review Book You Need,This is a great resource!!! I recently took the ARRT board exam in Radiography and I used this prep book to prepare for it. I scored a 98% on the exam. I would recommend this guide to anyone who wants to rock the boards. AsB
4,Radiology registry review book,"This is a great item... however, a cd is not included as previous versions used to. Now you can go to the website and purchase an online study course for $15 a month! Great alternative to buying the book! Wish i knew that before i bought the hard copy!!!"
4,simply wonderful,"This book was great.Even though it was used,with a little pencil writing on the inside,it could pass for new.It was certainly worth the buy."
1,Not for fluoroscopy,"Do not get this book if your goal is a state fluoro license. I contacted the publisher (McGraw-Hill) to confirm whether or not this book would be useful for fluoro exam prep. The person I spoke with told me it was. This is incorrect. This book IS NOT. Bottom line, this book may be good for basic x-ray, but DO NOT get it to prepare for a fluoro license exam. I wasted good money, don't do the same."
4,Just Buy It! Don't Ask Questions!,"I highly recommend this book if you're taking the National Registry. After studying with this book and finishing my exam, I can see why everyone else recommends it so highly. Easy to follow format. Lots of information. Just buy it. Don't ask questions."
5,Great Resource,I was in retired status for almost five years. Had to re-test in order to get my registry back. This book is the only resource I used and I easily passed the test! It had been around thirteen years since my original test date.
3,book is dated,Dated by current standards. Buy updated book for current information.Basic information on all subjects. Did not like tests in book.
2,"slow moving, pretentious and out of date","If you are a fan of apocalyptic fiction, there are many better books to read than this. While I did finish it, i found it slow moving (very slow), Pretentious in language, and very out of date in the effects of war. I think the real message was about the value of civil defense. An interesting point, but the author, writing in the mid-50's was talking about efftects of atomic bombings that are much milder than true. Totally unrealistic."
5,Love the stuff,"I bought this at a local Walmart, but had to share how much I love it. I got it w/the purpose of trying to help control my acne prone skin, dryness and facial redness. All the ""typical"" acne cleansers & moisturizers you find out there either make my face super red (compared to the mildly red it usual is) or makes me break out more.This stuff may not end all blemishes, but I've found that the blemishes I still get aren't noticable at all, and my facial redness is finally under control. Not to mention my skin looks worlds better now that its not dry (I was never able to use a moisturizer bc they always make me break out, even the ones that aren't supposed to).I now use this in combination w/a tea tree oil fash wash."
4,Nice,"I use this in a mixture with Argan and Coconut oil as a beard conditioner. Does the job. Conditions my beard, moisturizes the skin, and leaves a pleasant scent."
5,Very Nice Product,I have psoriasis. This is the product I reach for the most. Releives the burn and itching. My doctor is also a fanof tea tree oil. This blend works the best!
3,Tea Tree Oil,"It is not pure tea tree oil, so I'm not sure if it will make you break out when you put it on your face because there is also: soybean oil, safflower oil, and oother ingredients I can't pronounce. I just got it today, and it smells good, but I'm using it in the prospects of clearing up my acne; I'm not sure if it works yet, I'll update in about a week or so."
1,hollywood beauty tea tree,"I bought this without checking the ingredients for natural hair, turns out it's not made out of 100% naturalproducts (duh). I tried it and it made my scalp very scratchy. I don't know why. so Thump down, going in the garbage."
1,Not tea tree oil,"The number one ingredient in this product is soy bean oil. That's not what I wanted. Also, I saw it at Walmart and it was only 2 dollars."
2,Not worth buying but its worth renting.,"The game is fun for like 3 or 4 days. First ide like too say the good: the blood and gore is good, multiplayer deathmatches are fun, the single player mode is good for about 2 days, and that is about it, about the good. Now here is the bad: very poor and blocky graphics,its boring, if your one of the code buffs the codes are good but make the game more boring, and every time you start a new multiplayer levels you have to go back and set the codes back on, the controls you start out with are horrible( my advice is to change it to the right-hand move setting so it controls like goldeneye),during multiplayer mode when you try to shoot someone far away you dont hit them and when you try to shoot them up close they have block heads and are impossible to hit becuase they move impossibly fast!, and finally you will be bored with it in 4 days."
2,2-1/2 stars actually...,"Duke Nukem is 1 of my favorite games. Just the FPS series I mean. I played this, and single player was ok, but not too good. It was hard to control for me and to go thru a lot of complicated structures. I mean, u could beat the levels, but it's hard for me to move around.What's really good about this game is the 4 player deathmatch mode. All in 1 N64. It's fun to kill my friends, and the Dukebot too at the same time. Only some levels like Stadium and LA Rumble (highly recommend) are good for multiplayer, since the rest r too large and more for single play.If ur a hardcore Duke fan, get this. But if not, and u like action and FPS games, rent it first. Be sure to try the multiplayer mode! it's fun."
2,"OK, Not Great.","My advice on this game is to rent it. It's not worth buying. The animation is junky, plus the areas are so limited. If you are going to buy a game like this, get Doom 64."
1,"If you desire easy control for your game, this is Not it.","Graphics are okay. This is a pretty clean version from the computer version. However, getting around the game is not easy. This is not for beginners or people who like to be precise. The aim will move around everywhere and it feels like you can't get the screen to sit still for a second so you can blast an alien."
4,a great port however many problems,ok first off i would like to add duke 3d is mutch better . but their are alot of improvements over this first off the grabbing theme is mutch better but all in game music is.Gone so any track's that we'er in the pc verson are gone and dukes 1 liners are censored however their are some good things. one his pistol looks much cooler wit h a laser sighting addded. the last boss moveing in 3d but these are just small up gradeing . i say download ed its free and you can buy duke 3d and have a ball plus when you get good with pc you can all so join multiplayer games over it.
4,Come get some 64,"Duke Nukem 64 isn't a bad game. In fact, it could be one of the best on N64. I don't know. I havent played much shooters on N64. But, I do own this and chaotic DM with 2 freinds and a bot couldn't get better. Quake 64 and Doom 64 can't offer this much fun. THis is essentially a port of the pc game, but with new levels and add-ons to existing levels. I recomend this game."
4,Great Multiplayer,"When I rented this game, I got bored with the 1 player pretty fast. My annoying little brother kept insisting on playing, so we began to play 2 player, and the fun began. I loved how you could beat the game in 2 player mode, which is a nice touch that Goldeneye didn't have. We raced through the games puzzles pretty quickly working together. Thats why I must say that this is the best multiplayer game I have ever had."
1,not worth 10 cents,"not worth 10 cents, graphics are very poor for nintendo 64 The game is very tedious finding pass cards in every level to open doors gets old very quick. The aliens also dont put up a fight just there to die. Co op would be a nice feature but it is the same maps and bots running in circles is boring. After level 2 there seams to be missing the yellow card looked every where and my friend and i could not find it. A much better version of this is availible on the ps1 . definately dont waste any money on this game, it down right sucks"
5,Exactly What I Wanted,"This is a great set of pots and pans. Not only did I get this set, but I also purchased about 5 more pans, and love them all. I was comparing this set to the Calphalon Contemorary. I went to various department stores to talk to sales people that work with both companies, and they all preferred Analon Advanced. These pans are truly nonstick inside and out. The only place where food gets stuck is on the bolt(s) inside the pan that hold the handle(s) on. The handles on both the lids and the pans never get hot. I have even put them in the oven, and they work perfectly. The only thing that has happened is the bottom of the pan where the flame hits it has slightly discolored. However, I keep my pans in the cabinets so it's not an issue."
5,Don't waste time buying anything else but this Analon Advanced,"I have waited about one year before writing this review to observe the performance of this cookware over time and.... I loved it the first time I used it.... and I still love it today ! This cookware is heavy duty and is a joy to use and clean. I love the nonstick both on the interior and the exterior, after 11 months of use, they look just like they did when I took them out of the box. This would be an excellent choice for the novice or the professional cook."
4,"great value, great price","Pros: great price, actually does not stick, heavy duty and durable, easy to clean, arrived on time.Cons: metal part of handle gets very hot (keep your hand on rubber grip)and no saute' pan with set (bought the Anolon Ultimate pan from Amazon for $30. works great for everyday use.Advice: unless you're a pro, don't buy the 3 or 5 qt. saute' pan to compliment your 8-piece set, they're overpriced for everyday use."
3,Could have been better but still good.,"Good coverage of most quilting styles, would have liked to have seen more traditional quilts. There is adequate information for each image, and each quilt. Color reproductions were only fair in some pictures."
4,Garmin Aviation GPS Serial Data cord for PC interface,"This cable fits the 296/396/496 series of Garmin Aviation hand-held GPS units. It allows one to interface the GPS unit with the MS Flight-Sim program (using the GPSOut software - Google to find the software). If your computer does not have a serial connection, you need to also purchase the serial to USB cable. So far the cable has peformed without problem and the delivery was on time.DKM"
5,Great Item,I got this to convert some floor speakers to mount on pole stands. They were just what I needed and expected. Very good quality and even come with the mounting screws. This was a great buy!!!
3,Good album and is worth having,I loved their version of Little Red Riding Hood. The album has some really good stuff.
4,Almost perfect.,"Did a ton of research on these before I bought this one. Have put over 250 miles on it so far. Excellent value, I get a great workout. Haven't installed the shifter as I set the rotor in the middle and use the bike's gears instead. Only two small cons, although nit-picky -The rotor continuously knocks every so often and you have to stop and start again to make it stop knocking.The lock handle, locking the bike axle onto the trainer, will mysteriously unlock and cause the bike to shift sideways. Happened once fully, nothing broke, thank goodness, but have to check it every time I get on. It's been half unlocked 3 or 4 times since. I hop around on it, must be the vibration of 50 miles or so that loosens it.I would recommend this as the best in class. The flywheel is heavy and creates a great workout."
3,buy the CyclOps Mag instead,"This trainer mostly does its job. My biggest complaints are that it is very noisy (which is annoying in an apartment building) and the resistance is not very strong (fine if you are going for an easy ride, but not quite enough if you are trying to do high intensity intervals). My roommate has the Cyclops Mag, which is both quieter and provides more resistance. For this reason, I usually end up borrowing hers. The bar mounted shifter only makes very slight changes in the resistance. If I was buying the trainer again, I'd save the $20 and buy theCycleOps Mag Indoor Bicycle Trainer"
3,"Good product, one flaw","Trainer was easy to put together and looks sturdy. I can't comment on how well it works because I haven't been able to use it due to the one flaw I mention in the title of the review. Nowhere does it say that your bike needs to have a rear wheel with a quick release skewer to be able to use this trainer. It wasn't until I got to that part of the installation that I realized I would need to buy a new wheel to be able to use the skewer they provide that locks into the trainer. Maybe that's an obvious thing that I should have known about, but I was unaware. I could use a new wheel so I'm not too upset about it, but you should know about this before you decide to buy the trainer."
4,Sturdy and effective,This bike trainer is well made and has proved very worthwhile attached to my older mountain bike. When the instruction manual states that a knobby tire is not recommended it is not kidding. I didn't have a smooth tire initially and the noise and vibration was horrible. Using a cheap smooth tire made a huge difference and now the trainer is nice and quiet. I take off 1 star because of the bar-mounted resistance adjustment lever. I could not get it to work; the instructions were useless. The gears on the bike provide all the resistance variance I need so the extra lever was a waste of money. Get the model without the remote lever and save about $10.
4,Four star only because it's new :),"I'll update this as soon as I have more experience with the product, but so far, pretty awesome. Easy to assemble (though it got tricky trying to attach the L-bend threaded rod (tire tensioner?) - protip on that, attach it to the resistance bit first, THEN attach that to the stand.My wife thinks it's loud, I think it's quiet, but either way it's living in the garage because I can already feel the workout coming and it's not going to be a good thing in a 70* living room!I took a quick 'ride' on it before heading to bed, and slept like a baby because of it.Thanks, CycleOps, for giving me the ability to get my ride in when it's nasty out. Very happy with this product so far."
4,Wish there were more books of this nature.,"I have been interested in the umpire's world since I was a kid. I was never a good athlete but was hyper-fair in decision making on the ballfield and knew the rules, so I enjoyed being the arbiter from time to time. The book is quite interesting because it covers a long range of time, from the 1930's to the 1970's. The umps in the beginning of the book were ones I had heard about for the most part; but the last part of the book dealt with umpires I watched in my youth. There are funny anecdotes and I was surprised at the rigid honesty of some of the complaints about specific men in baseball, whether they be players, managers, owners, and sometimes even other umpires. A fun read. My only small complaint is that although you catch a glimpse of the varying personalities of those sharing their story, the writing style tends to be virtually the same and somewhat dry on occasion. But if you are a baseball fan, this set of a dozen umpires' storylines is enjoyable."
4,Good quality even though it's a refurb..,I have no complains with this drill. Received in like new condition and has worked fine so far.
3,Miss and Hit,"'For the World is Hollow and I have Touched the Sky' may well be one of the reasons that the Original Series was cancelled. It is a very ordinary story which you cannot really feel part of. Yes it does allow McCoy to have a romance, but everything is so uninvolving you feel it is a waste of resources all round. 'The Day of the Dove' is much better. It perhaps shows for the first time that there is more to the Klingons than just being the enemy, looking for advantage over the Federation at any opportunity. They only do this of course once they realize that they are being manipulated by a malevolent creature. I gave three stars but by episode it should be 1.5 for the first and 4 for the second."
3,The Good with the Maudlin,"For the World is Hollow... is too lacking in action and has too much melancholy for me. McCoy has two problems... he's both dying AND in love. If you like love drama, go for it. I'll pass. Day of the Dove - now that's action. Many reviews trash it as a weak story line. Perhaps they are right, but it has plenty of hand-to-hand action. Doesn't hold a candle to many of the 1st and 2nd seasons' best, but in a dismal 3rd season, this episode stands out as one of the more exciting. Where there are Klingons, there is action!!!"
4,well it works,"the bouncer looks and works like it says... the only problem is that my son hates it! he screams the minute hes put in there, but is happy to be bounced on my knee for what seems like 23 hours a day. i probably will sell it to someone because for me, it just takes up room!"
2,Not as expected,"Unfortunately the bouncing mechanism is not strong enough to bounce the baby's entire body. When my 9 lb. baby was in there only her feet were bouncing. It did not create the same feeling that she gets when I bounce a ""regular"" bouncer with my foot. A huge disappointment! I returned it."
3,Different,"Not what I expected. The designs are different & the suits are not easily recognized like the traditional cards, but they're o.k. - no playing instructions are included, so not a good gift."
5,Love to cook in large amounts,This product was purchased to match previous pieces in a set. I love the size of the stock pot
4,Excellent plug and play product,"This product delivered as promised. Easy installation and provided me with everything I needed. Speeds, where my vehicles had stopped for extended breaks, and what routes were being taken. Fantastic tool!"
3,MacArthur - the Ego Maniac,"The movie - MacArthur was ok, but I thought Patton was better. I think MacArthur was really full of himself and he had an ego, as big as all outdoors. This movie was a bit vague about some things like MacArthur getting fired by Truman during the Korean War and what happened afterwards."
4,"Good movie, very informative, could have been better","This is a good movie, very informative about MacArthur. I would have liked to seen the 2hr 40min trade screen version because a lot of interesting events have been omitted from this movie that occurred in real life. All in all, its refreshing that at least some people remember the greatest General of the United States ever. His positives and negatives are portrayed in this movie very straightforward. Hollywood has seemingly forgotten about the war in the Pacific against Japan. In the past few years tons of movies have been made about the European theatre with almost zero about the Pacific. MacArthur, the Army, Nimitz, the Marines, and the Pacific and their conflict relationship is quite interesting. I would love to see something to that effect on the big screen (not holding my breathe)."
4,MacArthur,"This movie is well-made, and presented well. I had no personal liking for General MacArthur, and my feelings were enhanced by the presentation of his super-ego overiding vast military experience."
4,Good Movie,Even though this is an older movie it shows how determination and sticking to principles can win the day. The product arrived on time and in good condition.
5,Excellent book,Very pleased in service and product. Product was shipped quickly and was well wrapped. It is always nice to have this kind of service.
4,The best biography film ever made.,I enjoyed this film because of Gregory Peck's portrayal of General Douglas MacArthur. It was powerful and I was amazed by it. The portrayal of President Truman in the film was just as convincing. I think it's worth watching.
5,"Steve Wozniak, Inventor of the Apple Computer","This book is perfect for a school book report! It is both interesting and easy to read. Though it is written for older children, it is sophisticated enough to be appreciated by adults. It includes many details about Wozniak and how he became involved in creating the original Apple computer. The author writes in an easy-to-understand style with touches of humor and details that make Steve Wozniak come alive as a ""regular guy."" Includes many black and white photos and a great glossary of terms."
4,Board books are great,"This is a great book for preschoolers. It is a greatteaching book for circle time. Not too long, nicepictures, and full of information on a preschool level."
1,does not fit Garmin 276c,I purchased this power cord for a Garmin 276 gps. I specifically wanted the one clearly pictured on the website that has the 90 deg bend at the end. I bought 2. I received the item and it does not fit the 276. The contacts are correctly placed but the rubber type product that is meant for a press fit into the gps is too small in diameter and the cord immediately falls out. The end of this cord is straight and not the 90 deg. It is packaged as a Garmin product with the 276c clearly on the package so I do not know where the problem lies. I tried to contact Antonline but they do not provide for any human to contact to explain/rectify the problem so I ended up sending the cords back and eating the shipping each way. Will never buy from Antonline again.Garmin 12-Volt Adapter Cable for GPSMap 276C (010-10516-00) I would personally verify with any vendor offering this product.
1,Garmin 276C Power Cord,The powercord sent was a straight connection rather than the 90 degree one and would not stay plugged in to the unit. I wish I would of tried it before cutting and soldering to my motorcycle connection. Tis junk and can't use it. Money wasted.
1,Doesn't FIT!,"DOES NOT FIT! Product is branded with the GARMIN logo. And further states for use on GPSMAP 396 (our model). As another review states...""The contacts are correctly placed but the rubber type product that is meant for a press fit into the gps is too small in diameter and the cord immediately falls out.""Before ordering, I visited the GARMIN WEBSITE to grab the SPECIFIC PRODUCT NUMBER FOR THE CORD - to make SURE this was the right cord on the Amazon site...and IT DID MATCH.You're forced to cut the plastic packaging to get it out to try it. I'm going to attempt sending it back..."
1,Product shipped is different than shown,"I read the reviews before ordering this product but I assumed the customer who written the review stating that this product was different than the one which is shown had simply ordered the wrong cable. I ordered the cable for my 276C GPS Map and the cable that was delivered,(unlike the picture shown on the web site), did not have the 90 degree turn where it goes into the GPS. Just as the other customer had stated...the cable would not plug into my GPS. I tried it and returned it. Now I don't know where to order one to get the one that I need. Amazon was very cooperative in the return process but I still don't know what to order to get a proper replacement."
1,THE CABLE IS DIFERENT TO THE PHOTO,"THE CABLE IT'S NO SAME TO THE PHOTO, DO NOT HAVE A TERMINAL CIGARETTE CONNECTOR, I LOST MY MONEY. I think you wrong the part, I receive Part No. RB, have a wiring diagram for make a Gilsson RB cable for install a DB-9 serial connector, but no, I buy to you other cable whit 12 volt adapter cable."
2,The ever wary eye upon French society,"Simenon is always an OK read. As time goes on, maybe one of the unforseen feats of Simenon, is that he has left a series of quite accurate images of French society as he experienced it. In this book we discover the world of Hotel Majestic in Paris, seen from the perspective of the employees. We are also a trip to Cannes and Cte d'Azur discovering the life of prostitutes there. The plot of the crime Maigret is unveiling in this book is quite sophisticated, perhaps a bit to sophisiticated?"
1,Very dissatisfied,"I was extremely unhappy with this book, a few of the recipes were alright. However, many of the recipes were very dry and hard to form into cookies due to not enough liquid. Another problem was the ability to layer all the ingredients into the mason jar!!!! THEY WOULDN'T FIT therefore having ruined a whole recipe of ingredients."
1,Sorry I bought it,The oatmeal cookies in this book are terrible...Sawdust must taste better and it will be more moist. I think she cut back on the recipe quantity so they would fit in the jar...whatever she did it turned out very wrong.
1,"Nice book, awful recipes",I didn't want to give these as gifts before trying out the recipes. The first one I tried made cookies that were about as dry and as hard as rocks. The second recipe made cookies that came out like pancakes that I had to scrape off the pan and throw out. I wasn't interested in wasting more time on any others. I modified one of my own favorite recipes to fit in a jar.
5,Great book!,"I have been using this book for several years and absolutely love to make gifts for my friends using the book. The recipes are easy. The book describes how things are to be stacked in the jar to look their prettiest, and the instructions are very easy to follow. My friends love the gifts. I have used the prepared jars for my own ""quick"" cookies and the cookies are delicious! I highly recommend the book."
2,More like a short story stretched into a novel.,"The plot was thin. We followed characters that had absolutely no bearing on the plot. Some of the prose, while stylish and full of images, seemed random and sometimes confusing. This story had a lot of potential, but it feels like a 3 page short story stretched to make a novel. Not Zelazny's best work."
3,Egomaniac and all around mean bastard,"I give it 3 stars because there is some talent there but Tosh is such a egomaniac I don't like him as a person very much. He thinks he is god's gift to the world. Did you know he was glad when Bob Marley died because after that he would get the limelight ""he so deserved""? He was upset that Bob Marley got all the attention. Hello Peter! He got the attention because he was a hell of a lot better than you both musically and as a person."
5,Exelent album,"The best album of Peter Tosh,and my personal all-time best reggae album.Incredible songs like No Sympathy,Burial,Why Must I Cry...incredible meaning lyrics and phenomenol music and sound efects.It really is a 5 stars album."
5,Great Peter Tosh Debut Album,"Legalize It could very well be Peter's best album. There's a little bit of everything on this album, including the humorous Legalize It, the excellent Igziabeher, and a softer side of Peter on Ketchy Shuby. But some more real talent is on the old Wailers classics, Burial, No Sympathy, and Brand New Second Hand. My favorite track is Why Must I Cry, co-written by Bob Marley. Every track is good in it's own right, and this is a great cd to buy for any collection."
2,Close...,"I haven't quite figured this book out yet. At times it seems like a compilation of different authors as the tense seems to change from chapter to chapter. There's some neat information in the first half, but as some have already pointed out the second half is generic in it's dog care.While the pictures were in themselves nicely done, 80% of the dogs shown were overweight and didn't even match the standard set on the inside covers of the book.Of course if you don't like nylabones stay away. If you are interested in rat terriers this seems like the best first attempt but you can get more accurate images and information on the rat terrier sites on the web."
1,"Do NOT buy a dog from this woman, or support her book!","I bought a puppy from this woman in 2002, and she gave me a free signed copy of this book. My dog has mange and two luxating patellas. I wrote her to warn her of the genetic problems with her breeding stock, and to tell her that otherwise I adore my dog. What I got back from her were angry, ignorant replies where she accuses me of trying to get a free dog from her. I told her that a ""free"" dog from her would definatly not be ""free"". Please do not support this woman, and by all means, do NOT buy a dog from her! If you'd like to see the email transcript- see my puppy's blog at Myspace-- user name is weasagail . For what it is worth, her book has nice pictures of rat terriers, but thats about it (as other reviewers have described much better). At the time I received it, it was literally the ONLY rat terrier book out there, and therefore it was the best. But the day a second book became available, this one became worthless."
3,I'm happy there is finally a book about these precious dogs,"I bought the book for my husband for Christmas. Our whole family enjoyed reading it. I think there could have been more pictures of the different types of Rat Terriers; classes and colors, etc. The same dogs seemed to be displayed throughout the book. We did enjoy the book. It was quite informative"
2,"Good history, very generic information, poor specimens.","The history is somewhat informative. I felt the information wasn't breed specific enough, more like generalized canine information. The pictures did not represent what a good quality rat terrier SHOULD look like. Most dogs pictured had oversized ears, buggy eyes, and their confirmation was awful! Most of the rats pictured in this book are poor representations of the breed, and would motivate most purchasers to steer clear. - A breeder in Colorado."
2,Not Informative,"A Complete and Reliable Handbook is neither complete nor reliable. Penned, obviously, by an author who loves her rat terrier and who enjoys telling stories, the book contains very little usable information. It has no guidelines for training that are specific to the breed, no cautions for health concerns that are prevalent in rat terriers and has only a brief history with no sourcing. Additionally, many sections read like product advertisements, touting the wonders of Nylabone.This is a fine book for general information and for ""awww, how cute,"" but turned out to be not at all what I needed."
2,Too Generic,"As many have said, this book is just too generic. Beyond that, I must take issue with the comments by ""A reader from colorado"" above. Millions of dogs die in shelters each year because breeders massively overproduce puppies to conform to some artificial human standard of beauty. Who the #)(@*$*( cares?! It's personality that counts. If you want a Rat Terrier or any dog-- do not go to a breeder but visit your local shelter or an on-line resource such as Petfinder.org. Breeding dogs should be criminal until every single unwanted canine has been placed in a permanent loving home. I have a rescue RT, and she is a fantastic girl. She had in fact been dumped by a breeder at animal control after she stopped ""producing"". Disgusting!"
1,Dangerous as well as irritating,"Real rating (-5), do not buy this kettle. I bought this kettle for my elderly parents based on the automatic spout opening mechanism and its compact design. Very DANGEROUS for anyone, more so for the elderly or younger operators, pouring boiling water. The one thing you expect a teakettle to do is POUR THE WATER."
3,Dynomax 17418 did not fit my SUV - 1995 4Runner,"I received the product with a minor dent in the muffler-still this will rust first. Protective packaging would have been helpful. There is no inlet pipe on this unit and I would not have known this before buying-it is in small print on the instructions flyer that came with the parts. Installation requires a flanged inlet pipe to attach to the cat and as it turns out the tail pipe did not fit- went up against the frame and still misaligned with the existing cat, so this is not a DYI product-had to spend another 100$ to have a piece of pipe welded on and pay for an inlet pipe and installed by the muffler shop. Would not repeat the purchase. The unit sounds good though."
2,"Almost works, but disappoints","This engine will actually run for a few seconds, but the cheap plastic gears are somewhat deformed, causing it to constantly stop and bind. Pulleys are made of rubber, and flashing on the them and the plastic also make it stop. A great idea, but stinks in quality. You can get the same exact product at musclewires.com for $49.95 and be 30% less disappointed. It's worth about $10.00 for the removable nitinol spring, but the rest of it is plastic junk."
2,Didn't care for the characterizations,"This book seemed pretty flat to me, compared to the characters on the TV show. Especially the sub-plot surrounding Spike. There was a lot ""happening"" in this book, but I couldn't be moved to care much. Unlike the show, where you can go from tears to laughing out loud in a heartbeat."
2,"Love Buffy, but...","I LOVE Buffy The Vampire Slayer, and Angel...but these 3 books were SO boring to me. I could hardly get through them."
3,Dissapointing Action,"I thought that Nancy and Jeff built it up to much in the summary. They said that when one of their people dies it closes the door and they must find an entiarly different way home. While that certainly did happen it didn't have that big of an effect,they fixed it in three pages. And the death wasn't all that big of a deal. I think they did not spend nearly enough time on the finding the way back through a portal.And the summary also made it sound like Faith and Spike had alot to do with the plot while they didn't really at all. Some parts and caracters(a.i Kate) could have been completely eliminated. So while it was good, because all Buffy books are in my opinion, it was definently a little dissapointing."
3,Shipped with the wrong poster in it,"This product was good for its price, the disk came unscratched, the case was in average to rough condition as expected.It came with the wrong poster in it i know have two of the same kind, for that reason I gave it 3 stars"
5,Gloria****** Is truly a God honoring song.,This couple is definitly glorifing God. The cd is FIVE STAR
5,GREAT,SAW THEM LAST NIGHT IN CONCERT THEY WERE GREAT. THEY LEFT THERE WATERMARK ON ME WISH THEM ALL THE LUCK MAY GOD BE WITH THEM
5,Worth every penny.,"This cookware set is simply wonderful and is a delight to use. The pots and pans are heavy (which I like) and very well-built. The stay-cool handles are an added bonus. I own cookware sets by Calphalon and Lagostina, and I have to say that the Anolon set is my favorite and the set I use everyday. I can't recommend it highly enough."
5,Great Product. Great Price,"I bought this cookwear for my wife last year. It cooks well, it washes well (that is my job) and it looks good and we display it on a pot rack.We had bought some individual pieces of Anolon, but the 10 piece set is a bargain.Almost every time my wife cooks with these pots, she thanks me again for buying them."
3,Not as it seems!!,"My wife & I bought this set primarily for the 11""/4.25qt. saute panw/helper handle. Received two orders that both did not include thispan, but a smaller pan w/o so called 'helper handle'!! The web siteis wrong people, be careful!! Finally went to Bed, Bath, & Beyond tobuy 10 pc. set, but they also had wrong pan in the set. (They gave usthe correct pan that was there, and just exchanged it for us.) Everytime we check Amazon's site it has a different product description ofsomething, plus different temperature ratings for this set. Not good.Please be careful. I wasted a lot of time sending boxes back to getwhat we thought we ordered in the first place. We want what we want."
3,Analon Cookware,"The cookware itself is very nice - it cooks food evenly and cleans easily. The lids are very nice. My only complaint is that each piece is quite heavy. It requires both hands to lift most pieces & transferring food from pot to serving dish is often messy, just due to the awkward weight of the products. Other than that, I have been pleased with them."
5,Terrific cooking tool. Makes cooking more fun!,"I bought this set almost a year ago, after having used a set of old-fashioned pots and pans for many years. These are a delight to use! Sunny side up eggs, which always stuck in the old pan and were often tough and rubbery, come out tender and I love just sliding them out of the pan onto the plate. I don't even have to use a spatula to loosen them. Even for food that doesn't slide out, clean up is really easy.I did take the time to not just read, but actually learn the manufacturer's instructions for taking care of them and follow them to a T. (My Dad taught me that if I take care of my tools, they'll take care of me.) So they still look and work like new.I enjoy cooking much more now that I don't have to worry about sticking. I'm more adventurous, because I know that even if the food doesn't turn out great, at least it won't be a hassle to clean."
5,Excellent Home Gourmet Cook Set,"I spend some time researching to finding the right set of non-stick for someone who wanted to do a little more than boil water at home. My final authority was Consumer Report, who ranked this set very highly in terms of quality--and it was cheaper than some of the more prestigious competition.I have been using the cookware for a month and so far, I have not been disappointed! The non-stick works beautifully, although I have been trying to clean up quickly after use (this may not last long). I have even sauted vegetables with no oil sucessfully. The handles stay extremely cool and the glass top lids make staying in control easy.Not necessairly negative but prospective buyers should be aware that they are noticably heavier than cheaper cookware.From my view, the only negative (minor) is that the two sauce pans are a little slimmer/taller than I would like, although total capacity is fine."
5,I got what I wanted...*smile*,I got the product I purchased and in a timely manner. The had one small stratch from handling but nothing to make me regret my purchase THANKS!!
5,The Best criminal investigation show out there.,"This is by far the best criminal investigation show out there. The characters are very good, and the show never dies down. It's never predictible and there are so many twists and turns. One of the best shows out there!"
5,ncis season 3,"well first of all ncis rules!! i adore all the heroes, the story and especially gibbs!!Its not just a normal criminal series, it is funny and keeps you anxious! buuuuuuut it was really sad that kaite died i liked her ncis will never be the same:/"
5,movie series-NCIS,Fantastic DVD..........hope to buy all the other DVDs. Good price and very quick shipment.
5,Great series,"Great series, love it bunches. Purchased it for a gift. Arrived quicker than expected and was well packaged for protection."
5,NCIS great,"The third season NCIS arrived right away, in excellent condition, and it has been very entertaining. We especially like the added features (visiting with the cast, etc.) in addition to the series itself."
5,Love NCIS,I LOVE this series. The characters are all so great. Getting the DVD for the season was even more enjoyable ... no advertisement interruptions. Waiting anxiously for the next season ... on DVD and TV.
5,Great Show - Fantastic Season!!,"I just recently discovered NCIS (I know - where have I been?). It is just a really wonderful show - funny, intelligent, engaging. This season is better than the previous two, for two main reasons: 1) Character development of the leads is hitting a ""high point"" & 2)Ziva...great character, big improvement over Kate. Pick up the 3rd Season and ENJOY!"
4,NCIS 3rd season,I was very glad to find the third season on here because i have all the other seasons but could never find this one. It is very good and excellent to watch clear and good ty Faye
4,3rd season of NCIS,This was a interesting season for the show. Everytime you watch the show you learn and see something different.
5,Great Purchase,"I was so excited to have recieved my DVD's of NCIS. I have watched all the episodes already, and I'm really happy with the condition and the packaging of the product. Really happy with my experiance, overall.Thank you:))"
3,Yea I'm a Party Pooper,"I disagree with everybody that Zeva started with a bang this season. I really like her character now, but this entire season I was thinking they should ditch her. And I wasn't a big fan of Kate! Zeva just didn't get her groove until about mid-season 4. For me she ruined the possibilities of this 3rd season."
3,"It's good, but not great.","This serries is OK, but it really lacks the substance that Criminal Minds, MI-5, CSI or Alias has. The list goes on. When is the second season of Bones and Criminal Minds coming out?"
5,An Excellent Season of NCIS!,"Season three of NCIS is great! So much suspense, adventure, excitement, Tony, Gibbs, McGee, and Abby! Great new characters, though I think that Lauren Holly should have never cut her hair."
5,great price,The price I was able to get for Seasons 1 and 2 was great. The 3rd season price was a great buy and they shipped it very fast.
1,A waste of money,"I gave myself enough time to review with this book, but it didn't help me at all. I wound up desperately searching for my old school notes to help me understand what the book was trying to explain. I struggled to absorb the information in the book because there was so much of it, and after I took the test I found out that most of it was extraneous. I got a 630 on the test, and while that isn't a terrible score, I bought the book in hopes of working up to somewhere near a 700. I could have gotten a 630 on my own, without wasting my money on this book.There has to be a better review book than this. Try as hard as you can to find something else."
4,A new venture,"Produced by David T. Clydesdale, this project finds Dino bringing his inimitable style and flair to a program of classic chestnuts with emotive themes and lush orchestrations."
3,A great find for a DJ..,"As a DJ, I was happy to find these rare tracks (rare on vinyl at least). I'm not sure what these other people's problem is. Though these tracks have been collaborated together before and played out in the mainstream, they are nearly all classics.."
2,Let Down...,"Ok wait a sec.,all of these songs have been on the shelves for a while and to be quite frank,played out.If you're an avid techno supporter you should own all of these songs already. Don't waste your money, trust me and others when we say it's really not worth it."
1,Fisher-Price: My First Techno Album,"What is the point of ever making this CD? I've had most of these songs for at least a year. Columbia, what are you thinking?"
2,Old Skool,"These were great tracks when they came out, but what is the point in bringing a compilation out of 2 year old tracks? None of which are obscure remixes. Totally pointless album, unless you've been in outer mongolia for the last 3 years!"
3,Description Fail,"Great movie however whomever wrote the description stated that Alan Bean ""Apollo 13"" astronaut was fourth person to walk on the moon. Now that a fail because Alan Bean was the LMP on Apollo 12...oops! LOL!"
4,A Little Better Than Okay,"I am a novice to programmable calculators.And I have to say, the book was written a little better than the HP 50g user's manual, and I often get a headaches reading this book.But I did learn some things from this book --directly and indirectly. Here's what I learned directly from this book: RPN, Number Format, CAS Modes, Equation Writer, and Equation Solver. While I was reading this book I also found some incredible features. Such as factoring expressions like 3x^3+14x^2+17x+6 to (x+1)*(x+3)*(3x+2)and vice versa.The calculator is impressive, and this book did introduce me to some awesome features.If the book had more graphical illustrations and more examples, I would give it five stars. Because I was often lost just reading the texts."
2,Gives me a headache...,"This guide does contain a lot of valuable information, but it is very poorly written - not a professional quality document - lengthy, wordy prose, long paragraphs, poorly organized. For some reason, these calculators are plagued with horrible documentation, no matter who writes it. Apparently, the assumption is that if you're smart enough to use them, you should be smart enough to figure them out. This is true - but it's time consuming and not worth it unless you REALLY need the functionality they provide. If you must use one of the advanced HP calculators, this pamplet may be of some help if it doesn't give you a headache - otherwise buy an HP 40GS, which is the best grapher on the market by a long shot and costs half the price of a 50G. 40GS comes with a great manual and is very intuitive to use and program."
3,History soured by romantic mush!,"This should have been a straight historical film, along the lines of Tora Tora Tora, The Longest Day, Gettysburg , and Of Gods and Generals, to make it the DEFINITIVE film on Midway. Unfortunately, the romantic side story and the use of the English language by the Japanese participants, turn this movie into another war-romance feature. A lot of stock footages from Tora Tora Tora were used (shades of the B westerns!). As to how Universal got access to these from Twentieth-Fox puzzles me. The use of actual battle color footages is distracting as the grainy quality and the different camera angles are obviously out of whack with the cinematographic structure of the presentation. Editing out the romantic side story would make this more palatable historically. That would make the film tighter as, as is, the film is already long winded."
1,Poorer!Poorer!Poorer!,"Some of your reviewers must have been watching a different movie to me. This one is a shocker with bad production values,wooden acting,mistakes galore but I loved the final scene after the carrier has docked. Take a look at the couple of hundred people they rounded up in the background.They all seem to be still dressed circa 1976 and anyway which navy would let civilians anywhere near a naval base in the Pacific in 1942?"
3,Midway,"If you can ignore Charlton Heston and a sappy, romantic sub-plot involving his on screen son, this movie is a fairly accurate depiction of one of America's greatest naval victories. In the space of five minutes, U. S. Naval Aviators sunk four Japanese Aircraft Carriers, destroyed over 300 enemy aircraft and, more importantly, killed most of the elite Japanese Flying Corps. It was the first major reversal for Japan in World War II and marked the turning point in the Pacific. Japan was never again on the offensive after this battle."
2,avoid the dvd and go vhs,midway is not a bad film...but the dvd is done in one mono channel only..when the film was made it was in sensurround..and i thought the audio would be at least surround..but is it not and the video is still not what it should be...so go vhs and enjoy a pretty good film but not one of charlton's best...
1,Where's Coral Sea?,"What a crock!I bought this DVD in the (vain) hope it contained the entire 2:45 minute movie not just the stupid love scenes (which I really don't care for.) The long version (rarely seen on TV) of Midway with more detail (among the missing scenes: the death of VT-3, the massacre of VMF-221 and the battle of Coral Sea) is (I think anyway) actually a better movie than the theatre original which is on this DVD.Upon further reflection I should add the following. As it was pointed out, many of the additional scenes were shot for TV and not part of the original movie. However, if they could jam in those love (useless) scenes, why couldn't they stick in the combat (good) scenes that everyone else (myself included) wanted?"
3,"Poor sound, over-edited","Midway as originally filmed is one of the great movies of all time. This DVD is not.Problem #1: I have one of the best sound systems you can buy. The sound goes up and down and up and down on this DVD. You have to hold on to the remote just to be able to stay in the room with it because some combat footage is too loud, and other dramatic discussions are too low in volume.Problem #2: My wife grew to hate this move somewhere around 1990 because on the veteran related holidays, a good 4+ hours were lost to watching this movie. Others claim that the original was over 5 hours. I'm very disappointed with the 2+ hour version. I want to see it all.The manufacturer needs to do something to get us the complete movie. They won't, though, becuase they have to redo the sound for the DVD, and that's expensive."
2,Terribly Dissappointed,"I had watched this version when I first got it but must have missed the missing Coral Sea parts for some reason. It jumps from the scene where Rochfort has told Garth about Operation AF (Coral Sea) to where they are telling Rochfort that they had a rough time at the battle!Some really great scenes are missing in this verison. Hope that they release a full version sometime soon. Its a shame that this movie was so downgraded from the original.Bottom line: dont waste your money. Wait, wait, wait for them to put out the Full ""Real"" Collector's Edition.I note that the ""added for TV"" scenes seem to be more personal and probably added for the ladies but weren't they in the theater version too? I seem to remember seeing the scene with Garth and his girlfriend talking at their apartment before he leaves in theater. Perhaps age is starting to show ... in me! :)"
1,Pass for now.,"Another great film, ruined with two channel audio tracks. Wait to buy this one in surround sound. Maybe Image will get the hint, and use the technology available to them."
3,Almost a great war flick,"Actually, the battles and strategies are good. The problem here is too much daddy-son-girlfriend interaction that detracts from the overall film. So the son is in love with a Japanese American who is, like so many, transferred to an internment camp [a disgrace]. Forget the interactions and stick to Midway."
2,What a joke!!!,"Bad movie except for a few performances (notably Hal Holbrook). The movie stole a lot of footage from 'Tora Tora Tora' excetra, and added a few extras such as Heston's 'Matt Garth"" character (never existed) as well as Edward Albert's role of his son who is in love with a Japanese American girl. Oh please!!!! If you must watch this movie, make sure it contains the Coral Sea battle (which is good) and Heston's relationship with his girlfriend which will shed some light on his character for later in the movie. 'A Brdige Too Far' is a better ""rentle"" than buying this."
4,Midway,"Action and historical timeline was very good. Story maintained a good suspense level throughout. Very disappointed at the amount of bad language, and, as with most Columbia Pictures, they did not have a format that our language filtering device worked with. This movie will probably stay in the box until we can re-master it to remove the language."
3,The Only Midway Movie,This is the only movie about the epic battle of Midway which means that its the one that you'll have to watch to get any taste about this incredible pivotal turning point in the war in the Pacific. What can I say?*You get some great performances from excellent actors like Henry Fonda.*There's a melodramatic father and son plot between Heston and a young Edward Arnold over his Japanese girlfriend.*Historical figures are played by up and coming or known actors.*A documentary type feel for both the Japanese and American timelines which works to some extent.*A pastiche of footage from other sources which the filmakers used to 'fill in the gaps' in the plot with an acceptable but sometimes inauthentic feel. You've seen this footage in other movies.I've always wanted to remake this film. Maybe some day.
3,not bad,you couldn't get away with using stock war footage these days so this movie doesn't age well
3,This movie was OK,"This movie was OK. It explained a lot of info on the battle for Midway. I don't know if other people like it. Probaly not,i'm a big history and navy buff. If your like me rent this movie,you'll like it."
2,Stock Footage!?,"This movie is bad because of two reasons: the use of stock footage of the battle of Midway instead of recreating the events and all the actors are speaking English instead of their native languages. The reason that ""The Longest Day,"" ""Patton,"" ""Tora! Tora! Tora!"" and ""A Bridge Too Far"" are better is because they only use stock footage when showing a WWII newsreel. All the battles are recreated. The latter reason is also a similar connection to the forementioned movies. Anybody who has seen the Japanese actor Toshiro Mifune in his Kurosawa masterpieces knows his gruf, hard voice. He doesn't sound like that at all when he speaks English, he instead sounds like a Japanese man trying to speak English. These two problems ruin all the credibility of the movie. The extra star is to showing the movie in its orignial Panavision."
2,Inaccurate,"I was disappointed by the inaccuracies and vulgarity of the language portrayed (although that part may have actually been accurate to the day). Additionally, the acting/directing done in this movie was not up to par with the caliber of the actors present, in my opinion. I'd look elsewhere for a good war-movie (if possible)."
1,Freezes,"The DVD freezes on the first chapter, that's the reason I chose this rating. The movie is a great movie itself. Just this DVD sucks. I would recommend the movie but not the seller."
4,great update for a classic ww11 movie,"has always been a great movie for it's era, even dealing with racial issues that were still controversial at the time. clarity of film is fantastic in blue ray."
5,action movie,If you enjoy war movies you will love this one. This is without doubt the finest production of any war movie ever made. The cast is star after star after star and the action is realistic including some actual footage taken during the war.
4,Midway collectors adition,I like this movie but I'm having a problem with it it stops two or three times thru out the movie and I have to push the play or skip button a couple times to get it going again other wise I'm happy with it.
2,Lump of coal in your stocking...,Big names + poor history + silly storyline + idiot dialogue = world war 2 garbage time. Avoid it.
2,Profanity Galore - This is not the TV Version,If you loved watching this on TV as a child you will be surprised at the language in this version. If you are sensitive to profanity - don't get it.
2,Truly Horrible,"Not even close to history. What's worse, is thay've taken an actual, heroic moment from our history, and turned it into a 1970's, Carter era, peice of schlock. I really like the japanese girlfriend subplot...what PC crap!But the worst part, was the horrid piecing together of footage of the wrong aircraft, at the wrong times. The wrong planes, the wrong ships...The only saving grace is Heston, he could add a touch of class to a Hillary Clinton/Rosie O'Donell lesbian scene....Oh well, I'll stick with ""a wing and a prayer"", real airplanes, real carriers, and closer to the truth....."
2,Movie is not the complete original,"While this version of ""Midway"" has a lot of extra features, some of the original movie scenes are not there. Even my husband, who's only seen it a couple of times, realized this. I would gladly trade the extras for the entire original movie."
5,One of my favorite movies,"Movie showed up on time and in perfect condition. As much as I enjoy this movie (and have for years), the producers comments about the making of the movie were even more enjoyable and interesting then the movie itself. I will not give away any of what I learned. Also the comments were quite substantial. So I spent one evening watching the comments and another night watching the movie."
1,Missing scenes that were in when it was in the theater.,"Good movie, except they released the DVD like the VHS tape version, all cut up. The entire battle of Coral Sea is missing. The restored and full length version is currently being aired on TNT occasionally."
3,What Happened to The Coral Sea Sequence?,"I was disappointed, What happened to the Coral Sea Battle Sequence??? You made it sound like this was included in the this Special Edition??? I saw a version Years ago that had this in the Movie??? What happened to it??? Also Heston's Affair is only a added feature why isn't that in the Movie itself...I have the old VHS this DVD is no Different...Not Full Length..."
1,"Midway between ""bad"" & ""sucks""","This is not a movie for anybody who is interested in Naval history or has any knowledge of the ships and aircraft types that were actually in the battle. Besides Hestons' usual overblown acting, the movie is spoiled by outakes from actual combat footage shot long after Midway was a memory, involving aircraft types that were not in service at the time. Overhead views of modern(1950's & 60's) U.S. carriers only needed an Apollo or Gemini spacecraft bobbing in the water to complete the fiasco. This movie is one anachronism after another. For a far better portrayal of the events at Midway, I would recommend the television mini-series of Herman Wouks' ""War and Remembrance"", starring Robert Mitchum et. al. Although built around fictional characters, the historical research was better and skilled use of good models was better than bad use of inaccurate video. Skip this movie."
4,WWII in a nutshell,"Great acting (Heston's is the weakest), thoughtful analysis of Japanese policy, presentation of the many pieces of good luck involved in the American naval victory, and subplot about the injustices done to Japanese-Americans make this an epic film."
3,Ruined with a love story...,"Little did I realize, this movie would be on the cutting edge for a trend in historical movies. There was a stupid love interest story in it, not sure if it was historical or not, but it didn't add anything to the story. This is the reason this movie gets three stars.As for the meat of the movie, it wasn't bad, but it doesn't compare too well to Tora! Tora! Tora!. It didn't really explain the Japanese point of view very well (although you got some of it). It didn't go into the reasons why Japan decided to attack at Midway although they were kind of inferred at. Nor did it really cover the diversion raids up into the Aleutians. I thought Tora! Tora! Tora! did a much better job of covering the history. This one just seemed to want to get a movie about Midway out."
4,A Fairly Good History Lesson,"MIDWAY moves a little faster than TORA,TORA,TORA and is only slightly shorter. It will be entertaining for those who are interested in World War II and the crucial Battle of Midway which is really more of an air battle than a good old-fashioned naval battle. The strong cast is led by Henry Fonda and Charlton Heston and includes James Coburn, Glenn Ford, Hal Holbrook, Robert Mitchum, Toshire Mifune and James Shigeta.MIDWAY failed to receive any Oscar nominations in 1978 when the Academy Award competition was dominated by ROCKY and NETWORK"
3,I'm with the others,I am still waiting to see the whole movie. Like the others it is really disappointing to have it cut. I saw it in the movie theater. Why has the complete movie not been released?I would rate it with 5 stars if complete
1,Poorest war movie ever made,"'Midway' on DVD while we're still waiting for 'The Longest Day'- somebody's got to be kidding. This one really sucks. Here we go: stock-shots ripped off from 'Thirty seconds over Tokyo', 'Tora Tora Tora' and probably other movies, WWII newsreels footage extensively cropped to fit into the Panavision frame, meaningless cameos by various aging stars -probably to make the flick look like a blockbuster- , historical mistakes and countless errors about planes and aircraft carriers, inept dramatization -the predictable romance between Heston's son and a Japanese girl-, you name it. The only reason I give this awful turkey one star is because the software doesn't allow me to give it none."
3,Just slightly over-edited,"Our USMC squad went to the 'World Premier' at Luneta Theatre, Manila, Philippines. Midway WAS a Full-length FEATURE movie-then. It was near 5 hours long. Our sixes burned from seating.>These days the once good, and quite long Midway has been edited-down from it's feature film status, a 5, to the new 2+ hour typical 'Hollyweird' shortened edition, a true waste of unreplaceable WWII Pacific footage, though actually faked. According to The NAVY, there were NO USN photojournalists with color motion-picture cameras at or near Midway, and actual Naval Aviators names were changed, and most colorized motion picture photography was filmed at The Battle For Leyte Gulf.>Some carrier shots depict the ESSEX-class carriers designed POST Midway, and produced in 1943. ""Universal"" left-out several hours of video footage. Midway should be near 4-5 hours."
2,Typical Mid-70's Universal Quasi-Epic,"This is a standard-issue 1970's Universal movie (think ""Airport '75,"" ""Earthquake,"" etc.) It has a cliche-ridden script, cardboard characterizations, blink-and-you'll-miss-them cameos by older stars and it seems to have raided the stock footage of every studio in town. The great Toshiro Mifune is rather obviously dubbed by voice actor Paul Frees. All that said, they did get most of the facts right, and if you can get past the cheese factor, it has an interesting story to tell. I just think that the pivotal naval battle of World War II deserved a more documentary approach, ala ""Tora! Tora! Tora!"""
3,Suffers from comparison to TORA TORA TORA,"The subplots of this movie are weak. This takes away from a strong cast with a strong effort. Hal Holbrook delivers the best performance of the lot. Historically it doesn't suffer ""Pearl Harbor"" syndrome but I still felt like it was missing something as a movie. Perhaps it was because it older brother TORA TORA TORA is so much better. Of course it was also less of a success moneywise so perhaps the filmmakers made decisions accordingly. Its worth a watch, but don't expect a clasic."
5,Another great war movie,This is one of the best will watch it over again enjoy the old cast of actors They don't make them like that any more... SORRY to say..
4,Entertaining and informative,"Unlike other reviewers, I didn't mind the ""fictional characters"" that were introduced into this movie. The facts were still there and the movie was entertaining and informative. A well done presentation with an all star cast that works well together. Some of the acting by these veteran stars is not as good as I would expect, but the movie was still worth purchasing just to learn a little more about this decisive WWII naval/air battle."
4,"Okay, but could have been better","This film wasn't bad but could have been so much better without (a) the totally unnecessary love affair between Heston's son and the nisei woman, (b) the dubbing of the Japanese voices (should have used subtitles), (c) the reference to Admiral Nimitz ""missing the flatlands."" (The Admiral's home was not in ""the flatlands."" It is in the Texas hill country not far from where Lyndon Johnson was born and raised.) (d) a reference to Nimitz having been able to walk across the nearest lake during the ""dry season."" There are no wet and dry seasons in Texas. The incidence of rainfall is quite unpredictable, but this film was made in 1976 when the prevailing view of Texas was that of the whole state being like ""the Last Picture Show"" (not that it has changed that much...) Oh, yeah, Henry Fonda did NOT look that much like Admiral Nimitz."
3,Good but missing a lot from original theatrical showing,This film is very close to what did take place in June of 42.The actors did a good job of telling the story.The dvd version left out all of the Coral Sea battle and Charlton Heston's Matt Garth love interest along with the meeting between the young Japanese pilot and admiral Nagomo about the war and how Japan might loose it.Why all of this could not have been included into this version of the movie I do not know.Overall the quality of the dvd was very good.The audio was very clear and the video sharp and clean.It seems as though they even managed to keep the low bass of the Sensearound audio track.I found this dvd video a lot better then my vhs copy in quality.Overall worth the price and worth seeing again.
2,"Decent, but not the advertised film. Contains alternate version of 1968 theatrical","Bottom line: This is not the advertised movie. This is a new edit of the 1968 theatrical release which has removed a signifigant portion of the film. While the underlying story is the same, and the film is composed entirely of the 1968 version's footage, be warned that you can't judge this one by its cover- it really isn't what it claims to be.I was unsure how to rate this as my main complaint is not the content per se but rather the fact that the content is not what is advertised. They should not sell this as they are without disclosing prominently to every prospective purchaser that this is a shorter re-edited version of the theatrical release. Whatever the merits of the decision to re-edit the film, their is no excuse for releasing it under the same title without fair warning to purchasers."
2,No Coral Sea sequence on new DVD!,I purchased the Collector's Edition with the high hope that the Coral Sea sequence among others would be included. They are not! The extra scenes they're talking about deal with Charlton Hestons love interest and not the battle sequences! This puppy is going back REAL quick!
2,Bad Acting and Stolen Footage,"This movie couldn't decide if it was a soap opera set in WW II or a docudrama. Heston/ Sullivan romance adds nothing to the movie. Albert's character is winey. If you start watching the movie at the point where the American carriers leave Pearl Harbor is not a bad movie. The scenes of the air attacks on the Japanese carriers is interesting and has a degree of accuracy. Most unforgiveable and annoying thing about the movie is most of the battle on Midway Island is lifted from the attack on pearl Harbor in Tora, Tora, Tora. I know special effects were expensive but that's a trick worthy of a bad B movie."
3,"Accurate, but...","Insofar as ""Midway"" sticks to the actual history of the battles of Coral Sea and Midway, it's a pretty good film. The history is correct, the battles are depicted accurately and the sequence of events is laid out as it happened. The problem with Midway is that the makers apparantly didn't think the basic story was enough to hold viewers' interest, and so decided to wrap a love story between an Admiral's son and his Japanese-American girlfriend around it. Hello? Midway isn't interesting enough? The battle that turned the tide of the war in the Pacific and rewrote the book on naval strategy?Nevertheless it's still worth watching. History buffs will enjoy how well the events are reconstructed and general viewers will enjoy the complex unfolding of events that make the story of Midway as gripping as any thriller."
1,Can't give a minus star review!,"It's pathetic that perhaps the greatest sea battle in U.S. history generated such a lousy movie.This movie stinks on many levels. It uses outtakes from Tora Tora Tora, so the viewer sees interesting things like battleship masts at Midway. The actors, except maybe Henry Fonda and Hal Holbrook, do lousy jobs. Charlton Heston is particularly irritating- you get the impression that he was running the Pacific fleet and Admiral Nimitz just came in on the weekends to read his mail.The ""romance"" angle in the movie just slows it down and somehow makes you wonder if these people's personal problems were bigger than World War II!"
1,YAWN,"I fell asleep during this one, watched again, drank much coffee, then wished I had fallen asleep instead of watching it. Young men fought and died at Midway, not tired old actors. I wonder what they could do with it today, with better acting and realistic younger actors in the parts?"
2,get long and boring after while,Movie was alright some over acting though. The explosions were over done. Has some dorky parts in that don't make sense.
5,FROM THE DOLITTLE RAID TO MIDWAY ISLAND...,"When I first saw this film, I was blown away! But after seeing TORA! TORA! TORA!, I must now say: I'm, still blown away! The film is a masterpiece! It has great acting (which TORA! TORA! TORA! lacked), great visual effects (several borrowed from the aformentioned TORA! TORA! TORA!, but hey, at least SOMETHING good came out of that film), and historical accuracy mixed in with great fictional characters (which is what made PEARL HARBOR, the best film of 2001, an instant success). Anyone who loves war films and dramas will love this film! Count on it! Grade: A+"
4,Very good Heston flick.,"Though very 70's TV like, the movie is a good solid version of the battle. It sorely is dated, but I like all of the actors. And to see Erik Estrada as 'chili-bean'well worth it.Some Hollywood big shot needs to retell this story with modern CGI and a great cast. I think it could be another 'Saving Private Ryan'.I an a big Heston fan, so anything with him is good. And WW2? Well, I'm in!"
3,"of interest mainly to celebrity watchers, not historians","And not even for fathers of little boys, who learn that the action sequences are too few and too confusing. I'm not an expert on naval aircraft, but even I could tell that planes taking off were not the ones in the air, the ones landing, etc. The actors--OK they're great ones like Henry Fonda, Charleton Heston, et al--do not evoke the times but look exactly what they are: actors in the 1970s pretending to be great men of the 1940s. Could they not even have cut their hair correctly? Would it have killed Robert Wagner, Heston, and the rest to get shorter haircuts? That alone ruined it for me.As a naval drama, the most telling critic is my six year old boy, who watched the black and white 1960 film 'Sink the Bismarck' over and over again: one viewing of Midway was enough for him.For history, of course, one should simply read Gordon Prange's Miracle at Midway."
1,I had a great expectation for this...,"What would you get if you took a bad script, uninspired acting, WW2 stock footage, scenes from Tora! Tora! Tora!, and put it in a blender and mixed it around? The answer: Midway! This reeaallly bad movie suffers from everything. WW2 stock footage is over-used (most of it didn't even take place during the battle of Midway) and the scenes from Tora! Tora! Tora! are out of place. A corny love interest gets in the way of the action too much. Lot's of familiar faces in this, but their acting is uninspired, and the script is dreadful. About 30 minutes of important footage was cut out of the original release (including the battle of the Coral Sea). Please, avoid this film!"
2,What Happened!,"I think everyone has summed it up pretty well. I give it two stars for the actors if not anything else. Too many senes from tora, tora, tora. Above all too, too much is left out of the movie compared to what was at the movie theaters, especially the battle of midway itself. Who ever edited this movie for the DVD must have pressured into doing so. Remembering what was in the theater it seems alot was also cut beacuse of politics and our relations with Japan(Japan does edtit our WWII films weathet true or not and dictates what should not be shown)."
1,APC MAKES JUNK BX900R,I spent a lot of money for this unit and got about one year of use out of it before it started constantly beeping and overloading. I replaced the batteries with new ones plugged it in and it still overloads with nothing attached to it. I deduced from reading all the other reviews that this is a poor design on cooling the circuit board. The unit runs hot with nothing attached. I guess the cheap fan doesn't last too long and you ruin the warranty by replacing it. If you go to the APC site the unit is discontinued thank goodness they retired it. This will be the last APC product I buy.
2,Poor choice,"I wish I had seen the reviews before purchasing this unit. It has lasted about a year, started buzzing, then just cut off with only my desktop, a phone and and small lamp attached."
1,used to be a fan of apc,"This product is an unfortunate one. From the very beginning since owning it, it must be plugged in all the time to maintain the battery and take a great deal of power to do so. After owning it for less than two years, beeping has started anytime you turn it on (annoying that you can't turn it off), which suggests that its battery is about to do. For being such an expensive unit and not even being able to find a battery to replace it easily, I am thinking this may be my last apc. If you search apc's website, there isn't even product info or manuals for this manual, so support is lacking."
2,Ugh,"Well, I am 33 pages into this and having a difficult time of it. The author uses WAY too many sentences (and sometimes paragraphs) to explain/describe even simple concepts, then proceeds to repeat the same things over and over, when two or three sentences would communicate the concept nicely. Feels like it was written by Jean Auel (in her last few books).Just get to the point, explain it clearly and concisely and don't go on and on about it.I am reading it for a class I am about to take and I really hope the rest of the material (4 more books) isn't this poorly written. If so, I might need to take a different class."
4,Welcome back to Country,"I originally bought this album because I was going to see Matt in concert & wanted to know what I was in for. I was surprised to find the album was truly pure country - not the pop version of what radio thinks country should be. I was further hooked when I got to meet Matt after the concert. He is one of the truest people I have ever met. He writes about what he knows & isn't ashamed to admit he's made mistakes. It floored me to learn that he had been told he was ""too country"" for country radio. A pity. It's hard to find that lilting twang in the vocals & that soul-piercing cry of the fiddle & steel guitar on the radio. If you like classic country, you will love this album."
5,The resource on Carson City Gold,"A wonderful book with accurate, awesome information thatwill definitely please the reader of this book. DougWinter and James Halperin are two of the highest regardedexperts on mintmarked gold known today...Pick it up! You won't be disappointed."
5,excellent introduction to Weber's work,"Gerth and Mills' reader provides an excellent introduction to Weber's life and thought. This edition includes excerpts from _Economy and Society_, the brilliant essays ``Politics as a Vocation'' and ``Science as a Vocation,'' plus a brief critical biography and material from other sources.Weber had so much to say about so many subjects that any anthology would require a well-considered method of organization; this book has that. It is easy to navigate. When I want to know what Weber said about a particular subject, I look in _From Max Weber_."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS COPY!!!,This copy is only a low-quality PHOTOCOPY book of the original one. DO NOT BUY THIS. It is not worth your money.I am very disappointed to find out Amazon allows this item on shelf.
3,NOT SPANISH TO ENGLISH!!!!,"Amazon's description is wrong. This is only English into Spanish. If you look closely at the image you'll see it's only in one direction too. Ans as a result, since I'm a native speaker of English, I can't vouch for how good a dictionary/glossary it is."
3,It's ok...,My 4 year old enjoys some games. Most of them are too hard for her. But helps me to get her tired and happy
4,Waving arms in front of webcam = fun!,"Don't let your friends brag about their expensive Wii game system when you can turn your webcam into fun! Works with iUSBcam not just the iSight firewire cameras. The games are energetically fun as you wave your arms like you are flying. One note: the camera seems to have picked up on my bald head. I soon realized I was playing the laser harp with 3 ""hands"" as my head kept hitting an extra chord. It works best if I wear a hat. :-) Well worth the price. Fun for all ages. Two people can play at the same time: one as the left arm and one as the right. A nice mix of activities with levels of violence from none to mild. The bomb explodes in their updated version of pong for example."
4,good stuff,"I've always loved reggae music for the good vibes and political/social statements it makes. Peter Tosh fills this disc from songs about equal rights, praising Jah, and marijuana. Definitely good reggae."
3,"""The Best of"" may not be the best....","This album is a little heavy on peter tosh's later music, giving it a less authentic, classic reggae feel. Peter Tosh certainly has some excellent productions out there, and this doesn't really do him the credit he deserves."
5,Scrolls of the Prophet: The Best of Peter Tosh,THE MAN IS A PROPHET. Anyone who loves reggae will love this album
2,Title is deceiving,"I was a rookie golfer when I bought these golf balls, was under an assumption that I was getting 90 golf balls.I felt like they were just ordinary ones, nothing special to mention about it."
4,An Often Overlooked Classic,"The French Connection has never seemed to generate as much buzz as other Best Picture Winners, and is likely to be overlooked yet again in its DVD release, coming so close to the Godfather Trilogy and Citizen Kane. The exception is the chase, of course, long celebrated as perhaps the best ever captured on film. In addition to the action elements, however, there are other reasons to add this to your collection, including Gene Hackman's fine, Oscar-winning turn as Popeye Doyle and William Friedkin's energetic direction. French Connection II suffers somewhat by comparison - Hackman is still great, but the movie seems to lack cohesion, as if the writers patched the story together scene by scene, rather than knowing their destination. It is not a bad movie by any means, but certainly not the classic its predecessor is. The bonus materials are nicely presented and pretty interesting, for the most part - a solid, if not particularly spectacular, package."
5,Excellent Box-Set!,"This 2 DVD Box Set of The French Connection I and II is very well packaged and has lots of intriguing extras. The films themselves are quickly becoming classics, with Gene Hackman putting in stunning performances- especially in The French Connection II during his rehab sequences.I am most impressed that the film took advntage of the gritty and confusing street layouts of both Poughkeepsie and Marsellaise to add to what is an already filmatically challenging spy/crime story.Very good collection- would recommend to those who like good 'private investigator chasing dangerous drug lords' crime films."
3,"Bad translation/understanding of the movie ""feel&touch""","I was disappointed that the disk set did not translate 99,9% of the French spoken in the two movies. The French conversations are SO crucial!The French conversations are so crucial to the enjoyment of the movie, that I feel the left out translations as subtitles are a major mistake for a so-called ""Collector's Edition"".Too bad. I wish I hadn't purchased this disk set. Everything these days seems to be so focused at a mainstream American public, whom the movie studios obviously thinks doesn't care about the French in-between conversations. Talk about looking/talking down at/to the audience!"
2,This Is About The French Connection 2,"...This one...has a better car chase and a terrible plot. Popeye Doyle becomes a heroin addict, but then has to get rid of his habit and nab drug dealers. Sounds like a goood plot, but weakens through out the whole film. Character devlopment is pretty good, but is counterattacked by the plot. It only costs about $[money], so buy it if you want the sequel also, but don't expect very much."
2,Like being at a drive in...,"The film played on countless ""dusk till dawn"" horror bills at drive-ins through the early 80's, and this disc does a pretty good job of taking th viewer back to those long gone days of cheap thrills. The picture and sound quality are only about average, just like the drive-in, the only other thing you need is for someone to park their car outside you living room and honk thier horns during the nude scenes. And the movie? Well it's about average as well. The plot concerns a plot to get an inheritance and a bunch of greedy heirs. A true B movie on all counts, but not without a certain trashy value, those who spent warm summer nights watching this flick when it was paired up with the likes of ""Don't Answer the Phone,"" and ""Point of Terror"" may want to give this reasonably priced disc a look."
1,"This is so crap, but its a laugh","This movie is a complete nasty. Its a total shocker. Wont ramble on, but if you want any satisfaction out of this, just see it as a comedy and nothing else. And what was the story behind that carnival sequence ????. My friend and I were in complete hysterics laughing on the floor because it appeared to just be chucked in amongst all of this nonsense. A definate no no."
4,This Side of the Sky,Very good. I learned a bunch about Black History. The Authour took me right back and in that era which was not all that long ago.
2,A Fraudulent What?,"Until photography was invented and a negative image of the shroud was first seen, (1898) nobody had any idea that such detail was present in the cloth. The positive image as had only been seen for so many centuries looked to be no more than a shadow of a man. So yes, the ""medieval forger"" was clever indeed. Apparently he didn't want his trick to be even played until 5 centuries after it was allegedly created. (He knew, no doubt that photography would inevitably be invented, clever fellow.) He was also very daring, putting the nail holes in the wrists, rather than the palm which had been the traditional location. And if it is, in fact, a fraud, then we should be able to crank out duplicates, hand over fist today, no? Then how come no one has remotely succeeded?"
4,Building Valve Amp,It is a good book directed to beginners. You will find there many advices on how to plan an amp lay out and hints on metal working.Don't expect to find there math based circuit analysis for the advanced experimenter.
3,Building Valve Amplifiers,This book does give hints about proper consruction techniques but it is NOT about building a complete amplifier of any sort. It would be a good book to have on the shelf; it is not the first one to buy.
2,review,Good for building tube amp for hi-fi applicationsAlso writen in UK so there are some minor differences that need to be addressed if building in USA
2,Building valve amplifiers,"This book in my opinion is not what I had expected. If one has not used any kind of tools, doesn't know what a screwdriver is, this book might be for them. There were some interesting suggestions. No schematics or very little. If one has worked with electronics this is a book to avoid. I wished I had not bought it. There is far better information on the internet, lots better and it pretty much free. The title really does not fit the info held within it's covers."
2,The Japanese Twins,"I read this book as I child and bought it for my granddaughter. I re-read it to preview it for her and was very disappointed that it doesn't have any pictures. Throughout the book the author describes things and says, ""Here is a picture."" But there is only text. I would have paid more for a better edition. It is a great story and still of interest after almost 100 years."
4,Timeless Book,"I read all the twin books when I was very young, and I'm 60 now. This one is one of my favorites and I was delighted to find it still in print so I could purchase it for my twin grand sons. As a child, reading this book gave me a glimpse into another culture, something which will continue with other generations. Twins will identify with the youngsters in the book and non-twins will wish they were twins."
3,I expected more for this price,"I have owned several down comforters, from a fabulous Hollander Home to a cheapo Tuesday Morning one that was mostly feathers. This one feels ""heavy"" and does not provide the warmth I expect it to provide. I paid less for one at Land's End with higher warmth, less weight. It is much better for a simlar price, the Land's End one 1) weighs less 2) more warmth 3) no crinkly plastic sound (and if I ever had a problem, great CS). In fact if I knew then what I know now, I never would have bought this one, and I bought 2--and it is way to complicated to return a large item like this. For the same price range I would go with Land's End."
4,Sturdy but breakable.,"Comes with a nice grip, excellent for just screwing around. However they have begun to split and one did fully crack. Nothing a little duct tape couldn't fix :) I have owned these a little less than a year."
2,"Set of 2 40"" Hardwood Datio Bokken Practice Sword","I bought these for myself and my son for Aikido weapons training. They are not very well made and appear to have been factory seconds. To clarify there are cracks in both to point that they might easily break and splinter. One is practically straight with no curve. The handles are nicely wrapped but the wrapping tends to come off with use. There is also removable plastic guard or tsuba, which is not very functional and more decorative. You get what you pay for and these are not high quality, hence the expensive price. I will eventually buy something better."
3,pretty good,"Was satisfied with the product for as cheap as it was . But I got 2 different swords 1 ninja bokken and 1 samauri bokken(1 straight 1 curved). Was expecting 2 of the same. The ninja bokken was perfect, but the samauri bokken wasn't curved very much and was warped. U could see it by looking down from the tsuba. Other than that. It did its job"
4,Better than expected.,Great quality for a great price! The swords came well packaged and are still in good condition. They are heavy wood and not for small children.
3,A brief comment,"These black wooden bokens are okay but I prefer the ones with the natural wood grain still visible and with a light colored stain. Also, the ""purple oak"" ones that seem to be common from Brazil these days don't seem to be as sturdy as the Japanese white oak, although they're okay too. I say ""purple"" because they look like they're stained as a gimmick, but it's hard to tell unless you're a good woodworker (which I'm not).In some ways I prefer the suede-covered Kashima Shinryu style straight, suede-covered shinai for this sort of training than the boken, as you can still break a bone with a boken, but a shinai is much safer, and the Kashima Shinryu ones are even covered with suede. But they're straight and not curved, which is different from what most people are used to, but what the hell. Just goes to show you how involved just getting a good training sword or boken is these days."
4,My son loves them :),"These swords look very nice. My husband thinks the hand guards look a little cheap, but my son is only using these for practice, not actual contact, so he won't be using the guards. Great swords for the price. Thank you :)"
2,"They looked nice, however..","These looked nice when I took them out of the box however upon further inspection, these are not well made at all. The wood is already splitting on one of the swords and we haven't even used them yet. I seriously want to return these and get theCold Steel Bokken Polypropylene HandleSwords instead."
2,Broke soon after receiving them,"These broke pretty soon after my son received them as a gift. He isn't rough on them, but they are practice swords...didn't hold up."
2,"Cheap, and it shows.","I got these as a gift for a friend, so that we may have some fun sparring. However, one sword came with a large crease in the wood that proved to break open after only a couple hours of use. They also had a strange, chemical-y smell to them for quite a while.They can still be good display pieces, but I would recommend getting synthetic swords if you plan on seriously using them; the extra cost is worth their durability."
3,They serve their purpose,"Wanted to use mine as a prop for my show and they work, although the wood on one either came to me chipped, or is beginning to, despite never being used. Either way I could easily cut myself on it or give myself splinters if I'm not careful."
4,twins swords...,"They were bought for our 2, 9 year old twin grandsons, we bought the other sword which was different for their friend and they liked it better,.."
4,Good quality,Arrived on time and was a great value . Low cost and very good quality. I would purchase this product again.
2,wasn't what I expected,"I received other items from this company that were perfect. On the website it stated that these items were all first quality and from Indonesia. The other items I received matched my china perfectly. This one cup was different. Thicker and lower quality, colors didn't match. I looked at the box and this one item was from China. I called the company. They were great. Tried to find me a different cup and when they couldn't sent me a return label and credited my account. The credit took some time to come through but finally did."
4,In-depth informational text,"This book's reading level is for upper elementary or middle school readers. I like the level of detail it gives into the ways erosion occurs, the relevant photographs. There are a glossary and index in the back of the book. This seems like a good choice if your student is researching erosion."
1,Moldy - will this ever be safe?,"The good news is that, except for the mold, the Ironman Tri-Fold Premium Exercise Mat met my quality expectations (5 stars). Further good news is that the shipping met my expectations (5 stars). What I did not expect is for it to be delivered with mold or algae (it's green when I wipe it off) particularly on the parts of the mat that were not enclosed by the cardboard package. This made the experience a 1 star experience because I have had to spend a good deal of time cleaning it. I am a little uncertain about the safety of mat, even if it appears that I have cleaned the mold off. The idea of having to return this gift is appalling."
4,Classic Nastie!,"""Spit"" is one of my all time favourite little ""nasties"".It's sick alright and still very disturbing, even though it was made way back in 1978. Ok, it's low, low budget, but that's why it works.The film's lack of music throughout makes it all the more off putting.Camille Keaton, as the victim, is an absolute trouper.Rodney, is Gold.This Millennium Edition of ""Spit"" is something my brother and I used to joke about. Ever since we first caught ""Spit"" at the Drive In on it's original release, the idea of a special edition of ""Spit"" was something we only ever dreamt of one day owning.To have it like this, THX Certified Transfer, Dolby Digital/DTS 5.1, looking and sounding like it was made yesterday, with extras laid on, you've got to be kidding.And that cover ain't half bad either....hey?Warning:Definately not for the kiddies."
3,"it's a, um er ugh, good movie","This movie was tough to watch, and I am rarely offended by movies. The characters are so vile and there is so much violence in this movie, I would genuinely worry if people took it lightly. On the other hand, it is so violent and graffic, it exposes you to that side of life that is far too real, unfortunately. Having known victims of violence, I can relate to them much better now than before, and I am glad that a movie can helped me on this point without having to go through it myself.The plot lacks a bit,, and the characters aren't delved into with much energy. However, there is enough there to help you through the horror scenes. So if you can deal with being depressed, and you just want to test yourself, this movie may not be a bad idea."
1,Women beware!!!!,"Oh boy.... where do I start? Never has a motion picture presented me with such moral delemas... I pray the feminist movement groups don't get their hands on this. This is a gruesome, disgusting, worthless piece of trash that deserves a star simply because it aims to be disgusting, worthless trash and succeeds. If you want to see a much better, similar themed movie, see The Last House On The Left."
3,I Spit On Your Grave Lives Up To It's Expectations,"I remember reading a book by the PMRC's Tipper Gore back in the 80's that mentioned this movie. Mrs. Gore said that it is a blatant rape and violence movie. This was back when she wanted records and such rated.Well, I was browsing though the DVD selection and saw that this movie was available. I picked it up for curiosity's sake.What I got was what I expected. (If not more, most movies don't ever seem to live up to it's hype) Blatant Rape and Violence. It was actually quite disturbing. Something I won't pull out for my mother when she wants to watch a movie with me.The DVD is good quality and contains the trailer on it as well. The scene selections are nice too."
1,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"There's really nothing to watch there. There's nothing to like. Don't get me wrong - I hate violence in all its manifestations in life although I like it on screen, but here we can't even empathize this woman 'cos the movie is just sooo bad. The acting is terrible, characters do very strange and unexplainable things. You can't feel with a character when you see everything in the film is false and naive. Don't believe the taglines - there's nothing shocking in there. It's just one big waste of time. You'll feel cheated and robbed. If you hate violence in cinema, I guess you are not reading this right now and if you like shocking movies, don't bother with this one, there are plenty of others that are much more shocking and I assume you already know them all by names. Go and watch ""Irreversible"" for god's sake."
1,What a sick disappointment,"I watched this film hoping for a great revenge flick, in which the victim of a brutal rape enacts the revenge on her assailents like they deserve. Unfortunately what I saw was a film about a woman who gets raped, the details being the main focus of the movie, and a bit thrown in at the end about her getting revenge by killing the guys. Only the bath tub guy gets what he deserves. The other guys all get relatively quick and painless deaths. They should be killed like the victims in ""Saw"", but they actually seem to get off pretty easily.The fact that the rape scene is around forty minutes long proves the misguidedness of the film makers. It's like using the movie ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" to say that murder is wrong. It just doesn't work to throw the subject in our face and force us to stare at it.I just feel like this movie screams to be remade, with the rape being downplayed, and the revenge being emphasized. It could have been done far better."
1,"A very dull, unbelievable movie, with horrible audio","I had been wanting to see this ""notorious"" movie for a long time. Now that I have seen it, I can honestly say ""What's The Big Deal?"". Other than the fact that the Camile Keaton gets attacked 3 times, and makes a lot of noise while doing so, I didn't see what's was so horrorible about this movie. The one thing that I found bothersome was the sound. Other than the commentary tracks, there is the original mono audio track, and the new dolby 5.1 surround track. I listened to the latter. It sounded like someone had put the microphone up against another tv to record the sound....This movie is unbelievable because Camille Keaton is raped & sodomized by several men on 3 different occasions, and within a day or so she able to walk around like nothing happened to her."
2,I'd spit on this movie!,"I'm a keen horror fan and thought wow this movie looks really scary. But here is what I saw:A woman comes to stay at a house by the lake.She gets rapedShe seeks revengeThe end.If I look it from a horror perspective then yes it certainly has the gore and terror we all expect in a standard horror. The deaths are all done within about 15 minutes, which leaves just over an hour to get bored and lose interest.This movie may have been more entertaining if the story was more padded out and had more of a back story. We don't know anything about the people in it, they are just thrown into a situation and there you have it...a pointless story. For example in a horror you often get told why the killer is murdering teens - he doesn't just turn up and kill people for no reason.I guess if your into classic banned nastys - you may like it because its so outrageous but I just couldn't get anything from it...it was pointless."
3,VERY INTENSE MOVIE,"This movie is not for the faint of heart.I'm not going to tellyou what the story is about because a lot of other reviewers alreadyhave done that,but I must warn you that there are some really disgusting scenes in this movie.The bathtub scene will freak every guy out! Also there is a lot of full frontal nudity.The acting is a little weak but the intense plot makes up for that.This movie is not for everybody so watch at your own risk."
4,womans revenge,this movie really wasent scary well except the bathtub sceen and the ending but still a good flick worth about $8.00
5,the best slow movie ive ever seen,"A lot of these older horror films fall into the rut of being slow involving little dialogue with long stretches of setup for the messes, but I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE manages to have enough intrigue to hold on. I have a horrible attention span for movies, usually finishing them in several sittings or not at all, but this one was definitely a sitdown watch it all the way through movie.Obviously, it is about rape and revenge. It's incredibly graphic in the rape, and just as heartless. Then it's those long stretches of setup, but the payoff is great as we see her inflict double the terror upon her assailants."
4,intense but not exploitive,i think films like this although they are hard to watch are much better than those that glorify violence against women. i have seen some really weird reviews on horrornews.;net on a part called the 25 most distrubing films of all time. i dont think i ever want to see things like asian cat 3 films or august underground or some of the others. personally this film or last house on the left are about as rough as i care to get. although i did order 2000 maniacs recently. i think this film does have a moral and artistic merit and is making some kind of statement
4,Not what you'd expect!,"A friend of mine and I watched this movie, expecting a cool horror movie, we had heard about the scene where she cuts off an attackers penis, and thought it would be a fun movie. well, we were about as wrong as we've ever been.THE STORY: Jennifer, rents a cabin to work on her novel, she meets this cute but dorky guy who instantly falls for her beauty and charm. Later in the film, the dorky guy and his friends attack her and rape her brutally. The treat her cruelly like an animal, and the dork loses his virginity to her. She gets away, and plots her revenge. Each man gets his own, and she brutally murders each one.This movie isnt a horror, and it certainly isnt an erotic film. the directing was cool, the acting could have been MUCH better. Though, Camille Keaton did a fairly good job. I think this movie is great because, it empowers women. I believe it says ""sure you can knock us around, but you'll pay for it"". And Jennifer definitely makes them pay for it!!!"
4,Disturbing,"If you are interested in losing ""sanity points"", then you should own or rent this movie. I am a horror movie buff and this movie disturbed me. ... this movie is, in my mind, THE most disquieting movie I have ever seen. If you are interested in seeing manipulation of a ""slow"" person, rape of a beautiful woman, and the revenge of the aforementioned beautiful woman than this is your film. Evil, but a glorious example of true revenge. An ""eye for and eye, etc"" is portrayed in its most graphic sense in this film."
3,This film is not about revenge. It's about justice.,"An earlier reviewer wrote 'why didn't Keaton just call the police?' That's just the point. That never brings justice. It might be according to the law whathappens then, it's not justice.The slow pace, the long scenes, the silent sequences and the threatening absence of a musical score thoughout the entire film make for a wonderful constant suspense. You KNOW what is going to happen all the time, it's the WHEN and HOW that matter here.The scenery and camera angles are at some points almost poetic and a real contrast to the ugly violence that is shown. That makes the film even more uncomfortable to watch, and that is precisely the point.It's not a brilliant film, there are some inconsistencies here and there, and apart from Camille Keaton's the acting is rather bad. But there are many good points about it as well."
3,She Cut Off What?!,"Typical revenge horror movie with some unusual visuals. It starts of with a slow burn but once the gang rape begins that's when the horror begins. I am amazed Camille Keaton portrayed that role. She was completely naked throughout the attack. I know it's acting but that must have taken a lot of preparation and trust in her costars. The revenge portion of the film is pretty shocking too. And that bathtub scene will haunt me forever. That was brutal. Very similar to ""House On The Left"" I agree that the subject matter and the way it is portrayed is graphic. But it's a reflection of reality. Women are abused everyday and rarely get the chance to exact justice. It was nice to see a woman get control of the situation. Not that I condone that kind of violent retribution....but it was satisfying to see the bad guys get theirs. Definitely not recommended for the kiddies."
3,Cult Classic or Cheap Thrill???,"The stark presentation of this film can either be described as a brilliant delivery, or a tawdry attempt at climactic cinema. In this case, I believe it's a little of both. Though not meant to be a ""fun"" film in the least, it's difficult to say whether or not certain aspects were presented to shock or tantalize. (The cover in and of itself is enough to entice even the most discriminating of porn-connoisseurs...) At best, it's a highly disturbing film with a grim 'happy' ending. Definitely not for the faint of heart."
3,Not as awful as I've constantly heard.,"Camille Keaton is a pretty young writer from the city who spends the summer in the backwoods to write her first novel. As all genre fans know, four rednecks rape and leave her for dead, but she slowly recovers and plans her bloody revenge. One of the most infamous films of all time, I Spit on Your Grave features no less than three rape scenes and an almost non-stop barrage of full frontal female nudity, but it actually wants to take its subject matter seriously, and it does work to an extent, but peters out in its unbelievable and silly finale. Keaton is, however, superb as the victim who takes charge against her abusers. Only recommended to the very curious (and even then, you better have a STRONG stomach).** 1/2 out of *****"
3,typical of period,Although for the time in which it was filmed it was probablyvery controversial. Looking at it now was not really that good of a movie.acting was typical of B movies in that time. it was okay.
2,Good Picture of Vigilante Justice,"As a criminal justice major I viewed this movie to find out if this was something worth debating, I was grossly offended not only by what took place in the movie but the way justice was inflicted, I by no means permit what happened but it doesn't excuse what the woman did, and the fact that it was based on a real criminal act makes me question the judicial system."
3,"Entertaining,realistic b movie","This exploitation flick will,no doubt,be more appreciated by fans of the genre than mainstream movie fans. However,I think mainstream audiences should take a look at this,though. The plot,based on a true story,concerns a woman who is brutally raped. She gets her revenge by killing them all. Many viewers,not new to the genre,will be shocked by the extreme violence."
5,Not as squeamish as everyoneis saying,"Rape is nothing to joke about. However, I found this movie not as graphic, compared to today's fare. I was excited to get to the part where she gets her revenge and they all deserved it. Parts of the rape scenes especially in the woods, I did feel uncomfortable, because the whole scene went on for like 15 minutes. I first heard of this film when I was 13 and I avoided the film until now, but since I saw Serbian film UNCUT I felt like nothing could be as graphic as that. I don't recommend I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE for sensitive viewers, however if you like justly deserved revenge films this might be your type of movie."
4,Just because,"First off people, this movie goes way over the top with the rape, I agree with all the one star reviews that it is a perverted rape sequence, that the director put in as mere exploitation. I think the material could've been handled better, like in Last house on the left, but it wasn't. I give it four stars however, because i like revenge flicks, and I like the plot. The directing with such a miniscule budget was good. And the storyline was good. Also it is a reality, and a movie that people can look at as a reality. I'm not saying the director meant it to be this way, because I don't think so. I agree with Roger Ebert in the film being ""Vile trash"" but I think it adds something accidentally to the psyche of everything. It's a film that is good to have if you're a revenge fan, if you have Death Wish, The Limey, the Punisher, Spawn, and other movies like that, then get this movie. Just because it has something to offer even though it doesn't have that much."
2,over the top,"this movie wasn't horrible but I guess I expected too much..the acting is pretty good and the production is good but the rape scene was crude and went on for too long and seemed misogynstic...after the rape, the events seem kind of hard to believe {Keaton seducing the rapists}..I can't really suggest this one to anybody"
4,WORTH WATCHING,"The plot has been used over and over again to the point of death, but works great in this flick. It's so realistic, My roomate and I questioned the ""acting!"" A woman is raped by four men (one of which is retarded and adds humor to the film, especially when he throws his hat off before raping the girl and crying out ""OLE!"") Left for dead, the girl plots revenge. JEFF DELL'S FAVORITE FILM!!!!"
4,RAW AND HORRIFYING,"This movie is real. I have never seen a horror movie that scared me as much as this one did. Watching the actress, you know very well that rape is the terrible act and should not happen to anyone, but it still can. Of course, some of the rape scenes were so graphic I could not watch them and I had to fast-forward, but the revenge the woman gets on her predators makes the film quite worthwhile. Excellent!"
3,To overacted,"While a good movie, this flick was WAY to overacted. The not-so-original plot is a young woman from New York moves to a secluded summer home to write her first novel. A half-retarded grocery store delivery boy named Matthew gets a crush on her and tells his redneck friends about her. They decide that she will be the woman that the Matthew loses his virginity to, so they rape her, beat her, and leave her for dead. She recovers and begins murdering her assailants in horrible ways.Blood and gore galore, I'd consider this movie, or the unrated version at least, a soft porn with gore. More of an exploitation film, violence and nudity are the main stars. This movie is definitely not for people with weak stomachs."
2,"A guy from Weatherford, Oklahoma","If your the kind of person who likes to see women get abused and then come back for revenge, then this movie is for you. This woman was on vacation when about four sick perverts rape her in her own home and also in the woods. I enjoyed the part where she individualy comes back and kills each one after inflicting pain upon them for a few moments. This movie is not for the squeamish, and not too bad."
2,THE MOST CONTROVERSIAL FILM OF ALL TIME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I Spit On Your Grave, Kids, A Clockwork Orange and Showgirls. What do these movies have in common? They are all a part of the great chain of CONTROVERSY. I spit is most likely the worst of the Rape-Victim-Revenge films and probably the only one that has no regard for dignity. I really advize parents to keep thier children away from seein this film as I saw it when I was 15 or 16. Hell, I just turned 18 in February and I've seen all the above films that I mentioned. I'm not proud of this fact but I'll tell you what, education can come from all mediums, even the most explicit."
1,Please do not waste your money!,"I first heard about this movie about twenty years ago and had always wanted to see it.It's been banned in the UK for many years and decided to use the u.s. mail service to get myself a copy.What a bad,bad decision! This is without doubt the most boring,tedious,badly acted movie i have ever witnessed.My Dvd copy is now used as a coaster!David/England"
1,Someone tell me....,"WHY is this considered a classic? The script was imbecelic, the revenge scenes were amateurish and unbelievable and the rape scenes, which were supposedly what makes this film so ""horryfying,"" while somewhat disturbing, weren't nearly enough to generate the rep this film has. Her reaction was almost laughable. Last House and even Death Wish were far, far better films.Don't fall for the hype. save your bucks. Rent it."
1,"WATCH A WOMAN GET RAPED, BEAT, & TERRORIZED. OH HOW FUN...",I watched this when I was a young girl & it still haunts me to this day. If you enjoy watching a woman get viciously raped for almost an hour then this is the movie for you.
1,DVD-R wont play on newer systems,"bought the ""DVD"" millennium edition and watched it on (a now old) DVD player a few years ago.This evening I tried to watch it again on my new-ish PS3 and it would not get past Dolby ad.Windows 7 laptop stalls one third the way through.. While this is not a film I love to see, I didwant to watch it once more as a re-make is out soon. Shame, my comparison is spoiled by what seemsto be a bootleg, bought on Amazon. Beware."
3,BARFARAMA!,"Yuuch! what the hell is up with that, this is not a horror film it's only mad ass violance. I did not know what hell I was watching I give the movie credit for it's nice scenery of big green trees and river oh yeah and the chick camille was nice too, but the rest of film can go in the garbage."
1,just say no,"I watched this movie sometime in the late 80's. It disturbed meto the point that I've never forgotten it, and never will.Take my advise and don't fill your mind with this trash. It willstain your soul. If you like to see lots and lots of violent rapethen this movie is for you and you need help. I can't imaginewhy anyone would make this movie. There is enough of this typeof horrible stuff in the real world without adding a fantasyversion."
4,"Not entertaining, but...","This is not an entertaining film. What is scary, though, is how little has changed in the way some men view women in the years since this movie was made. Just compare the conversation between the male characters in this piece and some of the most popular lyrics of these days."
3,Very 70's independant film,"about a subject that is just as horrific then as it is now. The four morons who raped her got what they deserved. Then as today, they would never be convicted, a few smooth words from an experienced lawyer, and they'd be out in about 2 hours. And she knew that and exacted her own justice. Although, it was far from a pleasant movie, I feel it would be beneficial for all woman to see it and discuss what they would do in her situtation."
2,Negating Factor,"The attackers -- the so-called attackers -- in this film could have avoided all subsequent revenge (or even problems with police, courts etc) if each had said to the woman, ""You better get some ice on that"" after completing the act. That admonition (some might call it counselling) renders inoperative all suggestions of rape or assault, allowing the perpetrator to skate away free -- and even, in some instances, glean widespread support from society, as happened in one particular Arkansas rape case. In this film, however, the perpetrators did not skate away scott free. Rather, they experienced justice.It was startling to find this film cast in DVD format, as it would normally be considered one of those old cheap throwaways, but obviously the producers thought otherwise. Enjoy -- and always remember the magic everything-is-okay, no-problem-at-all phrase following such an assault: You better get some ice on that."
3,I spit on this movie,"I bought this movie because when I was younger, I snuck downstairs and watched part of this movie when my sisters were having a slumber party...When i started watching the movie this time I thought..these actors are horrible..and the best part is how she gets her revenge on them for the rape..Other than that,,this movie [is bad]!!"
2,.,"I'll give it an extra star for being so extreme and awful. Not that I necessarily *admire* that, but it made it vaguely interesting as a curiousity. There's no question the film is in poor taste, if you will, but it feels more dated, amateurish and goofy than explicit and disturbing. I see no reason for a ban (though I never see any reason for a ban.) Anyhow, it's generally an awful film with nothing to engage you other than the fact that it's so terrible and willfully tasteless."
3,A+ Ginsu commercial.,"A poormans ""Deathwish"", 18-20ish guys will probably enjoy this stylish movie the most. It's got plenty of (violent) sex and brutally realistic gore. A most noteworthy ""bathtub scene"" will have ALL men curling into a fetal position and probably ruin any chance for bubble-bath romance in the future. Don't watch it with a wife or girlfriend, but it's worth a look."
5,for my husband,"My husband was very interested in rewatching the original version again after the recent remake was released. He loved it, and now has both films in his growing moving collection."
3,A Sexploitation Classic,"I Spit on Your Grave is not for everyone, and I can think of a few female relatives who would turn the VCR off in disgust, and immediatley call for a ban of the film in the name of Feminism. My biggest problem with it, is that the four bad guys, especially the retarded one, Matthew, are horrible actors. Camille Keaton, is lovely and believable as the young, sexy writer. But the 4 rapists act idiotically throughout the film, taking away from the raw horror of the brutal, and graphic rape scenes, very realistically shot. The revenge scenes were set up well, and provide a great climax to the movie...I would like to see this picture remade, as they have done with other classics such as ""Psycho"" or ""Planet of the Apes"", featuring a fearless actress, and 4 competent actors who would play the parts for realism. But would it sell well today? Only time will tell."
5,Not dissapointed,"I read reviews and asked a couple of people about this movie. I was very impressed. I have already watched it twice and i'll watch it again. Every woman should watch this movie. It was a very real situation that is never dealt with in that way.A woman leaves the city for some quiet time to write a book and runs into some problems. 4 Guys decide they want to rape her and they continuously do so. But they don't do it back to back. They toy with her. They beat her. They leave her for dead. Only, she isn't.She takes matters into her own hands and exacts her revenge on these guys. Every revenge scene was great. One particular bathroom scene, especially.This isn't really for the weak hearted. But it is a good movie (to me). My suggestion, watch it."
4,A disturbing Movie,After deciding to take a breaks from the busy city to write a novel Jenny decides to head to the country to settle down and do some writing.Immediately after arriving at her destination she is harassed by the village nit wits and brutally raped not once or twice but three times but this gang of vagabonds.The rape scene are especially graphic and so is her vengence on these men.This is a good film if you love to see good ole revenge films with naked beautiful women seducing men and then ripping them to shreds with sharpe objects.This is a good film and I recommend it.
1,"graphic and terrible, but reality","I put reality because this is a very strong depiction of what rape is and how men can be. It made me nauseous just watching it, and I read the other reviews on here about it and was very offended by the guy who wrote ""if your a man the bathroom scene will make you squirm"". Well, the man in the tub had brutaly raped this woman and deserved what he got, in my opinion if your a man watching this film what should make you squirm would be the scenes of the rape and just knowing that you are part of the male species that commit this horrific act. Dont watch this if you have ever been raped, it will bring flashbacks."
1,biggest disappointment EVER,"If you are looking for something shocking, don't bother with this movie.rape scene: why doesn't she run???? why doesn't she fight??? how come there's all this blood on her all of a sudden??? where did that come from???? stupid. revenge scenes: first of all, i wasn't upset enough to thirst for revenge. second of all, the murder scenes were even weaker than the rape scene.what you've basically got here is a movie hollywood could remake, scene for scene, including every gratuitous moment. and it would get made. it would show in theaters. and lots of annoying people would think it was horrifying. go rent ""irreversible"" it's much better at this sort of thing."
1,I Spit On Your Grave,After no word for three weeks I was sent a message that I had been sent notice that the product was unavailable. Not true. The message arrived the day after the last day that I was to expect it. I would have appreciated a timely message so I could look somewhere else. Instead the import CD wasted three weeks of my time.
1,Waste of money !,From the name of the movie you will think that you will see real good horror movie. In fact the story was so bad .....it is not worth it to waste your time and money .....!
1,"Waste of time, soft core trash!","I Spit on Your Grave, more like I spit on this movie. How anyone can like this movie is beyond me. I personally like violent movies, but movies of class and style, such as (Goodfellas, Halloween, and The Exorcist), but I Spit on Your Grave has neither, just a woman getting raped in the first half, and her revenge in the second half. Mabey the reason critics hate this film(HA-HA) so much is because it really does suck. Their really is no bacic story, and acting that deserves turkey awards for the entire cast. Come on people quit wasting your time on a movie that no one can even say (this is a horror movie, a suspence movie, or a drama) because honestly I don't even know myself. But I do know that this garbage should be banned from the public peroid..."
2,Umm... What the heck WAS THIS?,"I saw this recently (Picked it up at random on a video renting spree) it was in the ""Horror"" section... which is odd because it was clearly meant to be a Porn movie. You know the plot (the other guys have only repeated it about a million times already). One thing is that this film is totally non-memorial. I didn't even remember the main character's name before reading these reviews! Second is that it, as stated, was obviously meant to be porn. This is because she was raped repeatedly, and throughout the movie is usually either <a> completely naked or <b> in very little clothing. The acting is terrible. Ok, its not -bad- they act realistic and with almost no screw-ups, but I don't find any of it convincing. Some of the things she does are disturbing, even to me (and I watch Horror movies often) like the bathtub scene... whihc I wish not to remember.(Offensive comment coming up)This is a like-it-or-hate-it film. In particular leering perverts are known to love it."
2,A piece of cinematic failing,"I saw this film on it first release in the UK at the age of 25, shocked at the time yes. On seeing this again so many years later, the base degradation is still there the amature direction and production is still there, but the impact is not, how the world progresses! The sound and vision quality on DVD is on a par with VHS not bettering but equalling. The content although has the same macho / sadistic impact that denies women the right to say no, until you tip the scales. The final comment, women are the equal partners of men, but misuse or abuse and, well ? watch the end of this. but if you abuse you deserve."
1,A poor film with not much story that should not be seen.,This is a very low budjet film and really is nothing special. After seeing the exorcist I thought to myself I should start to get into these Banned movies. When this came through my door all that was in it was rape and more rape that should not be allowed to be seen in any country. It is not a horror or thriller but just more like a old cult film gone wrong. If you are looking for a film with a story line that is banned buy A clockwork orange.
2,Less than expected,"I ordered this movie with great anticipation of seeing some good old fashioned 70,s gore. BOY WAS I DISAPPOINTED. This movie shows very little in the way of graphic scenes (most of it you have to imagine) and falls way short in the story department as well. Its only claim to fame, the rape scene, was ordinary at best. Save your money."
2,The sex scenes are ridiculously simulated. For Adults Only!,"Also known as: Day of the Woman (1978).The DVD print is in excellent form. A big improvement from the old, scrathy, choppy prints we have seen on VHS fifteen years ago. This low-budget film has a cult following. There is male frontal nudity and female frontal nudity. The sex scenes are ridiculously simulated. A woman gets ultimatly raped by four men. They think they have left her for dead, however, she is very much alive and seeks out each man for revenge. For adults only! Available in unrated version.Remake:I Spit on Your Grave (Unrated)(2010)"
1,Violent and Exploitive.,Extremely violent horror/thriller about pretty young woman travelling to an island only to be beaten and raped by a gang of young holigans. Terrible film is banned in most countries and is an absolute abomination. Don't waste your time or money.
1,A Grave Mistake,"This is one bad film. It has all the style and charm of a 1970 porno flick but with none of the benefits. Okay there me sex and violence, but is that enough? As that isn't even done well I saw no. All in all this is one Nasty Video."
1,Garbage,"The only people I can see really trying to get this flick are poor souls in the UK who are curious as to why it was banned. I'll tell you why it should have been banned. Unfortunately in Britain they still censor and ban films, which is a joke, and people become obsessed with these ""nasty"" flick, most of them being just plain bad. Save your money, American or British, and pass over this poor excuse for a film."
1,Sick and repulsive,"I gave this movie at least one star because the woman got revenge. I was so digusted and shamed by this movie[...]This is a sick, sick movie about a horrific experience that women face everyday. This movie is basically rape porn, so if you enjoy that then rent it, but if you are a normal human being and are sickened by the act (which is very graphic in this movie) then avoid this [...]."
1,You have to be disturbed to enjoy this movie!,"Im not going to lie to you, but you do have to be slightly disturbed and/or sick to actually enjoy this movie. What can be enjoyable about watching a girl getting gang raped numerous times? And to say this is not worse than the likes of Deliverance is insane. Yes, there is a male rape scene in Deliverance, which again was not at all enjoyable to watch and i shall not be watching again, but the scene in that movie is far shorter and far less graphic than the rape scenes in I Spit On Your Grave. So basically, if you have any sanity and/or morals you will not enjoy this movie as there is absolutely nothing in the movie to enjoy."
4,Worth it for the commentary alone,"This movie is violent and very disturbing. Still, Joe Bob Briggs provides one of my favorite commentaries of all time. He argues that the movie does not exploit women, but rather is a testament to their power. That commentary alone is worth the ten bucks or so. Better yet, find the two pack with the remake and see how superior this version is."
3,OK...if you fast-forward through the rape scenes,"As a long-time horror fan, thought I'd finally get around to seeing 'I Spit on Your Grave.' I wouldn't call it porn, per se, but it does fit into the horror realm -- especially the last half of the film. In some ways -- sans the EXTENDED rape scenes -- this film reminds me of a low-budget 'Straw Dogs.' Film is probably a two star horror film at best, but added a third for Camile Keaton's first-rate job in an incredibly difficult role."
2,Horribly Disturbing,"I'm all for a disturbing film, but this one just made me sick to watch. The savagery that was committed in this film and the lack of inspired and cheesy revenge made this just a complete rip off of last house on the left. At least last house was done with some taste, some depth to the characters. There was no merit to this movie, and the only reaosn I gave it 2 stars was becuase it did what it set out to do, which was disturb the viewer with violent images."
3,"decent movie and all, but...","To the individual who wrote the review (above) as ""Turned On""- hey, are we supposed to be disturbed by your claiming to be aroused after seeing this film? Get a job!"
2,Guess you had to be there,"I just didn't like this movie. I like Camille Keaton's performance, as well as the performance by Eron Tabor. With the exception of Johnny, the bad guys are insanely stupid and cruel. The movie made me angry and I was certainly happy when Jenny gets her revenge, I just wish she had tortured them a little longer. I'm glad I finally saw this so I can cross it off my list. I don't think I ever need to see it again."
1,only pricks like this film,"This movie is just fake snuff. Thats it. Its boring, laughable, and not scary or disturbing in the least. Watch Last House on the Left, now thats scary!!"
5,A Fascinating Book About a Little Known Woman,"The Case of the Pederast's Wife, by Blossom Elfman, is an incredibly well researched and written book. the first thing one notices is the quality of the writing and of the scholarship and research. Oscar Wilde was a complex and intereting character and until I read this quite marvelous book, I had no idea that he had a wife! He was, after all, an avowed homosexual. As one reads the book one comes to understand the restraints of the time Wilde and his wife, Constance, lived. Many books, plays and films have been written about Wilde, but Constance, his wife and mother of his two sons, has been neglected, even avoided. Applause and kudos to Ms. Elfman who had the intelligence and wit to discover Constance Wilde and to bring her to life in a wonderfully written book."
5,Organic and tastes great!,I love this product. I am very excited to keep ordering this product. All the seeds grew. I will order again from this person.
5,wheatgrass,Seed sprouted easily. I am very satisfied with this wheatgrass. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone desiring to grow their own wheatgrass at home.
4,Good sprouting for wheat grass,"I've sprouted, with water only, several trays and I get about 80% germination. I'm sure I'd get 100% in soil, but I find water germination and growth cleaner and easier to use. Great flavor juiced!"
1,mold issues like other had,I ran a few batches with this and every time it got moldy. Then it attracted bugs in my kitchen(the seeds in the bag not the growing grass).
5,Wheat Grass,"This grass grows very well and very quickly. I just use it for ornamental purposes, and it looks great!"
2,philphan,"I can't speak to how this product is, but WOW.....I just bought the exact same thing from my natural foods store yesterday and paid .089 cents a lb. I'm in the wrong business!"
4,Plentiful and bountiful,"5lbs of wheatgrass seeds is a lot. Way too much. Plus, it's impossible to kill these seeds and not get them to grow. Soak them in some water, throw them on some dirt and you'll be buried in knee high grass in no time."
4,good germination,"The quality seems to be very good, with good germination. There are less costly alternatives, however, such as bulk from a health food store."
4,Excellent quality.,This item was exactly as advertised. It arrived on time andnon great condition.Not the best price I have seen but excellent quality makes up for it.
5,Met my expectations,"Just what I ordered...seeds. I planted them and within 7 days they are green and several inches high. i am growing this for a wedding centerpiece and It's beautiful, so I didn't eat it. but my rabbit did, and she approves!"
5,From seed to grass - HOLY COW!,"As I am writing this I can see these seeds growing. Just kidding but it has been 4 days and each and every seed has sprouted and is over an inch tall. I cannot believe how fast these are growing. I am looking forward to juicing these seeds. I have 2 15x9 plastic containers sitting next to myAeroGrow AeroGarden Pro 200 with Master Gardener 1-Season Kit and Gourmet Herb Seed Kit. The light from this bleeds over onto the wheatgrass seeds. I dont know if its the lights, the soil or the seeds but these are amazingly fast growing seeds.I didnt even bother planting the seeds. I just sprinkled them on the surface (like in nature), of damp soil and covered it with a cellophane covering. They have all dug in and have jumped up.I will update this review after we try the first juice from these.Overall a fantastic product, performs better than advertised!Thank you for reading my review."
1,Has live grain bugs,I received my order a couple of weeks ago. The shipment has live bugs -- Sawtooth Grain Beetles. I have had to move the bag from my pantry to the garage. I have sealed it and placed it in a closed can but still not sure how to kill them without contaminating the seeds. Usually I place a bay leaf on the top of any grain to keep bugs out. This bag was received with live bugs already in the shipment. The seeds sprout okay after rinsing them so they deserve at least one star.
4,An album the is warm and pesonal,"Clair Marlo's Behaviour Self is a collection of warm, well done songs. The quality of the recording makes it feel that she is giving a personal performance in the same room. This is not to say that her music is the standard ""coffee club performer with a guitar."" Her music takes you to many different places. You stroll through the French countryside with the accordion laden ""To Close,"" and you feel like you are in the midst of a gospel choir in ""Break the Chain."" If you are looking for a quaint, light and relaxing set of music, Behaviour Self is not a bad choice."
3,"Not my favorite of this author's books, but it's ok","Alessi is orphaned and looking for a place to lay down roots but depends too much on halos to guide her. A quick stop for gas in a small town turns out to be the start of her life in Charity. Her car is stolen with all its' contents and she is forced to make friends with total strangers and work in a bookstore by getting advance pay. Steve is eccentric and untrusting since his mother died and his fiance dumped him, so he is the last person to want to help Alessi. However, the lot falls to him. His life is changed in the most unlikely of ways...perhaps this was my favorite part of the book.A small town contemporary Christian love story, this is very different for this author, and I will continue to read her other types, I was not too fond of the halo theory."
2,Disappointing,"I had discovered this author last spring and liked her books -- I had read 5 of them. Secret, Unforgotten, Echoes and also Twilight, A rush of Wings, The Still of Night. So I was eager to read more. This one was not what I expected -- a downer. I just could hardly finish it. I had also gotten Freefall, but am not planning to read it. Not sure why the change in the writing."
2,Intriguing idea but I felt it lacked real depth,A fast and light read but didn't have the depth I like to find in a story. It was an interesting plot on the surface and there was enough to it that I did finish it but I won't read it again. Once was more than enough for me. It is a good clean book and if you have nothing else to read it will do but if you have other selections I would try those first.
4,had to finish it...,"From the first page, I was hooked. Kristen Heitzmann always does a great job of weaving a tale that includes mystery/suspense, wit, romance, and faith. I liked all the characters a lot, and felt they were all well-developed, including the supporting roles. I would absolutely recommend this book to others. I couldn't wait to find out what happened, yet I didn't want it to end. In a nutshell: well-written, good clean romance, very amusing writing at times, and perfect ending. Still wasn't quite as great as Heitzmann's Edge of Recall, but close. Happy reading!"
5,A Great Book,"This was my first time reading a Kristin Heitzmann book, and I loved it. I stumbled across the title at a library book sale and thought it looked interesting. Once I got started, I couldn't put it down. I look forward to reading more of her books!"
4,Thanks to Robert Reed....,"...all ""Brady"" kids got 8 mm silent movie cameras as gifts. The movies they made with these cameras is what basically makes up this television special. Better and more interesting than most of the Brady specials/documentaries. This special was put together by Susan Olsen (Cindy), which gives it some genuine Brady cred. Cast members are present as well to lend commentary where appropriate. Some footage is from the cruise Robert Reed took the kids on (the trip where Greg tried to put the moves on Marcia, er, rather, Barry tried to put the moves on Maureen). Surprising it didn't air more than once, considering it rated well on it's first and only CBS airing. This special was filmed after Robert Reed's passing."
2,Brady home movies to ROCK???,"I must say I was dissapointed with this movie.What's the deal with the loud pop/rock music that plays totally from start to finish!!???. It's like someone forgot that we were actually meant to hear what was being said!!!.The film footage was excellent & even better than I expected but don't even attempt to try and drag the 70's into the 90's at all, and especially with that shocking music throughout, it just didn't work at all!!.Production companies should try and remember that the people who buy these features actually want to go back to ""THAT"" time totally, and that any attempt to ""modernise"" a window in time is a HUGE mistake.Sorry to sound so critical, but I was really looking forward to a ""total voyage"" back to those 70's ""Brady Days"".My suggestion, turn off the volume!."
3,didn't like,"Book my be useful for academics, or written research. I was looking for visual research, and had read that this book is ""lavishly illustrated"". Though it has some illustrations, they are few and far between."
2,Let down,"I was excited about reading this book. The first bio I turned to was that of my favorite, Buster Keaton. After reading a bit of the bio, I put the book down and returned it back to the library where I got it. The information listed in there was wrong. They had a couple of facts that were not true, so that left me feeling very disappointed. If that one bio was filled with misinformation, how many others are?"
3,Therapeutic,I have several fountains but this one is the most therapeutic. The sound of the chimes and the water bubbling is very soothing. But it takes a lot of tweeking to get it to sound just right. And the pump was a little louder then I expected.
4,water bell fountain..,"i really like this product. if you buy it, you will need to take a srew driver and tighten all of the bells as mine arrived ""loose"", but no big deal. the second problem is that you cant use both floating bells as they tend to tip each other over. so only use one. makes just as pleasant a sound."
1,Never could get the bells to work right,"I have some Woodstock bells for the patio, so I thought this would be great. It wasn't. No matter what I tried, I never could get the bells to go around and strike one another properly. I feel like this product was definitely not worth its price."
4,Well written and Beautiful Art.,"I am happy with the book. The pictures in it are absolutely beautiful, especially the art work that is displayed. The text is very well written and easy to understand as well. (There is also a thurough glossary contained in the book)However, i was looking (expecting) a book that contained more information on particular spells that could easily be appliedto everyday life, and it didn't quite provide that on the level i wanted.The information about the Lwa was well written and quite inspirational. It didn't touch too much on offering's to the Lwa though, or invocations.Overall, it was a good book, just not quite what i was looking for, but an excellent addition to my VouDou Library."
4,Short and so sweet,"I just loved this book from the very first glance. First, the photos are good and easy to look at. The information about the featured Loas are pretty precise. The exercises inside anyone can do.........all and all I am pleased with this book and do recommend itMs. Amber"
3,A little bit of history I played as a kid,"As a kid, I owned a copy of this infamous game. It has been well described by other owners and raised the bar for biggest fail. As with most, I received it as a Christmas gift from my Mother who loved E.T. I played it for a few minutes on Christmas and a few times afterwords. It was never really fun to play, but I was able to call the mother ship and save E.T. from the evil humans. I didn't find it to be a difficult game, but it did raise my anxiety level every time I fell into those nasty pits which were a royal pain to get out of.All-in-all, This is one of the most famous games of all time and very classic gamer should own a copy."
1,i am still in a hole,"this game, sorry this item is not unfinished but it shouldn't even be in the market. Not only was it impossible to complete, it made me gag every time i hear the E.T. theme song. This game should be extreme punishment for kids to suffer if they misbehave or break something valuable. Please save your green dollars and go buy Call of Duty Black Ops II or Halo 4. Definetly the worst thing to be called a video game before Superman 64."
4,Excellent Read,"""FBI Man"" by Louis Cochran is an excellent read about an FBI agent based primarily in Kansas City. Very interesting chronicle of his history and experience with the FBI and several cases he worked during his time in the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Really interesting inside look at the life and lifestyle of an FBI man. (I might be biased, though, because Louis Cochran happens to be my great great uncle. Pretty cool!)"
3,Be familiar with the billionnaires....,Pierre Rey gives the reader the unique opportunity to get to know the details of this exciting and sometimes excentric billionnaire's life.An excellent book to read on your yacht or on the beach.
5,Lifetime Keeper,"Give one of these to a very special person only, never give it lightly. They will keep it for a lifetime. I got one years ago and I paid it forward. I know the person appreciates it because when she is feeling low, I see her using it for her coffee."
1,Red mug with hearts has poor quality glazing cup generates a lot of heat in microwave,"I purchased 8 mugs from Fred Meyer in Eugene, Or. 1-2 years later all but 1 of the mugs are chipped. I would not purchase this product until the manufacturer improves the glaze. When the glaze chips off it takes a chunk out of the cup. At $8.99 per cup I am very disappointed."
4,Nice mug,I really like Waechtersbach products and I like this mug as well as all of the other Waechtersbach mugs that I own. The only draw back is that they do chip. As long as I am careful with them I don't have any problem.
5,Blue Sea Voltmeter,"Well made and reliable instrument. I used it to measure the state of battery charge on my boat. I would prefer that it had a red, yellow, green indicator overlaid on the scale to make it easier to know the battery condition."
2,not great,"Cool idea BUT, this isn't really worth it. I bought it for myself but would never use it. On a positive note my 14 yr old liked it. I wouldn't recommend it for an adult."
1,how true - use this book,"I bought this book, excited about the prospect of a great book that would be interesting and different. It is a book that says what it is, but as a teacher, I could make all the signs that are in it and have access to most of the documents that could be legally binding. I was disappointed but should have known better...."
1,RIP OFF,Could'nt wait for a new book to come out imagine my surprise when i opened this book and saw it was a rerelease of long tall texans 3 so if you want to read this book go to the library and pick up long tall texans 3 dont waste your money buying men of the west
5,"It's a re-release, so what?","Yes, this is a past collection with a new title, but that doesn't mean it's a bad book. All three stories are terrific, but different enough to keep the reader from getting bored. I like the new title - it makes it easier to distinguish it from the other Long, Tall, Texans anthologies."
1,Far from classic,"Two powerful interstellar magnates vie for control of human-controlled space in this early (1959) John Brunner novel. This is the only novel of Brunner's that I've read, but I have to assume that he improved considerably later since he produced two very highly regarded novels, ""The Sheep Look Up"" and ""Stand on Zanzibar."" This book is a bit of fluff that displays all of the worst traits of Golden Age science fiction--a nave faith in the ability of extraordinary individuals (invariably scientists) to engineer the optimum human destiny, and a maddening tendency toward endless exposition delivered through interminable conversations. The hero, Counce, subjects people to horrendous fates, including starvation and torture, all in the name of a greater good--and they love him for it later. I don't think this novel has ever been reprinted (I came across it in a used book store), and I can understand why."
4,Corny but enjoyable!,Yes this was corny storyline but if you're a Marty Robbins fan I think you will enjoy it. I bought the movie because I'm a Marty Robbins fan and I wanted to see how well he did. I thought his acting was at least satisfactory. I didn't buy it because I thought it would be Academy Award material. LOL
2,Oh Marty!,"I loved Marty Robbin's singing, songwriting, showmanship and charisma but he appeared in a couple of movies that were amateurishly trashy. This is one of them."
2,Discover a beautiful region of France,"If you want to discover a beautiful and wild French region through the eyes of a Scottish writer, read Travels with a donkey. Stevenson, before he became famous, depicted his journey in the cevennes, with his donkey ""Modestine"". Rediscover the excellent style of a young writer about to become world-wide-known."
5,pleased as always,Was very excitied to find this book on amazon was here within days. Have found this very helpful with this being my first mastiff pup thanks again for being there amazon
4,Good book for the new pet owner.,This is a great book for the new owner. Lots of pictures and information.
1,Pathetic excuse for a book,"Pathetic cut and paste typical of TFH. Oh, and the company also owns Nylabone, which they promote in every book. Make sure that you don't get one of their HOLLOW Nyalobones for your Neo. TFH has no scruples whatsoever."
2,Disappointed,"Having purchased several Little Critter books years ago, I was disappointed at how flimsy the book cover was. I expected a more durable product."
4,Charming little story,I've always appreciated the stories and illustrations in the books of Mercer Mayer. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to add to their Mayer collection or to anyone who wants to give this as a gift to their grandmother.
5,Great Present for my Grandkids,I read this book to my daughter when she was little and now 20 years later I am enjoying it with my own grandchildren. Fun story and illustrations.
5,Great for beginning readers!!,"My first grade daughter really enjoyed reading this book. There were many words that were repeated which really helps out first time readers. In addition, there were enough new words to keep it challenging for her. The book was just long enough, not too short and not too long. I highly recommend this book for beginning readers. A plus for us, this book was on her AR list."
3,Just grandma and me,Just grandma and me is about this little kid that wants to have a fun time with his grandma at the beach. They go to the beach and try to have a fun time. The little kid does stuff that end up beginning well but ending bad. The lesson it teaches is that you can be having a good day or a bad day but you will still be grandma little grandson and you will always be in her heart. Yes it was a good book. The age level is pretty much around 1st and 2nd grade.
2,save your money.,"Miho Nomoto is beautiful...i'll give her that, but this movie is poorly made (no english subtitling or dubbing) and the sex scenes seem forced. there is one rape scene in the film, which i personally didn't like at all. as far as plot...there really isn't one, so don't even expect anything in that department. this is also a short movie by many standards (about 45 minutes) and the version i have does not contain any chapter breaks. so...if you decide to pick this one up, don't say i didn't warn you."
4,The Perfect biography for an excellent Pope and Saint,"I Have a real passion for His Holiness Pope St. Pius x, this means that i have read books about him and his life, but this was the absolute best, it is an easy and real fun read. I do recommend this for all ages"
1,whoop whoop,this movie blows. I really can't think of to many worse movies. It is flat out not funny. Really everything about it is bad. God I hate this movie.
1,NOT WORTH THE 'JAILBAIT',"I saw 'Jailbait' when it was first on MTV. I was looking foward to a stupid, funny entertaining teen sex comedy. What I got was a stupid, unfunny, offputting, offensive, teen pregnancy so-called 'comedy'. I happen to like MTV movies- I enjoyed '2gether', etc. but this was just plain bad. Do Yourself a favor and skip 'Jailbait' -ROBBIE SCHEER, 15 YEARS OLD"
5,Straightened hair the easy way,"I have wavy / curly hair and had all but given up on ever wearing it straight besides when my stylist blows it out after my haircut. Well, after receiving this styling tool, I have had great luck! It is super easy to use, if you can brush your hair, you can use this styling tool. Great, easy results quickly. Definitely love it."
4,"Finally, I can style my own hair!","I've read many reviews on this site -- some negative, some positive. I have A LOT of hair. My hair is full of texture. My hair doesn't grow down (length), it grows out (wide.) I WOULD NEVER USE A HAIR DRYER BEFORE! I couldn't unless I wanted to look like a clown. This product is the first product that allows me to dry my hair. The product does get very hot! That is what my hair needs to become straight and manageable, however. If you don't have frizzy and unruly hair, this is product was NOT made for you. I, however, must say FINALLY!!"
2,Not happy,"A flat iron does a better job. This device somewhat straightens, but it's too puffy. You still need to finish the tips with flat iron."
3,It didn't even last a year!,"I bought the Infinity at Shopko. I have thick, naturally curly hair and it straightened out the curl and made my hair sleek, not frizzy. I was very pleased with it. Unfortunately, it started losing power after only about 8 or 9 months then it died. I wrote to the company and they sent me another one for free. This one only lasted about 5 months! As you can guess, I didn't bother with buying another. I am still looking for one that will last longer...any suggestions??"
2,you get what you pay for,this item was just like a blow dryer but takes alot longer. yes it straightened my hair but no it wasnt quick or easy. I know that a flat iron damages your hair but i rather do that than take an hour and a half styling. however i do give this product kudos for not damaging. what can i say i didnt pay for the expensive option. Like i said you get what you pay for.
3,Not as great as everyone says.,"I bought this item with high expectations, because of all the great reviews. When I got it home and used it I was a little disappointed. First of all, it took a lot longer to straiten my hair than other people have said, about 45 to 50 min. Second, it didn't really get my hair that strait. My hair is curly, medium thickness, and about three inches past my shoulders. I have to go over every section of hair very slowly several times if i want it strait. Even then it still has some wave to it. Over all it's a good product, but if you want stick strait hair buy a flat iron."
1,total waste,"I have used other hair styling tools so I am not totally inept with them, but this tool was a real failure on my hair. My hair is fine and straight and I wanted a little curve to it (achievable with other hot brushes). All it did was to frizz my (usually) non frizzy hair. The strands do not wrap tightly around the cylinder and this causes fly away hair. For anyone with my type of hair, I wd strongly advise against this tool."
4,Easy to use straightner,I have never been very coordinated with the whole hair drying and brushing idea and was afraid to try a straighting iron. This straightens with tension and is pretty simple to use. I have even used it on my kids!
1,Infiniti by Conair BC173,"I have shoulder length curly, fine hair. I followed the directions for use and I ended up with a messy head of frizzy hair. The brush does more blowing than straightening in my opinion - it is fine for drying hair. But I did not get the sleek, smooth, shiny effect that was promised by the straightening tool. It was nothing like the salon straightening job I normally get. I will be returning this styler ASAP. Very unhappy."
1,Hate it!,I feel like I waisted money on this product. The clamps dont hold onto my hair like they should to straighten/dry my hair. My hair was still left looking like it was frizzy. I did a better job at blow drying my hair with a dryer and then straightening my hair with my straightener than using this product. Don't buy it!
5,infiniti,I have used many hand held dryers over the years. This is the only dryer that dries and straightens at the same time. Cant find in stores now. But excited I found it at amazon.
1,Do not buy!!!,This product is money going to the trash. I used it once and it doesn't do ANYTHING. It can hardly grasp the hair and can't really streighten anything. Simply doesn't fit.
1,Never buying from Conair again,"While the thing worked just as good as a flat iron in half the time I went through 4 of these, in a little over a year. They All died within 3-5 months of each other. I called the company and gotten replacement for my first one and and was given a 6-10 week wait, so I buckled and bought another one...which died before they even sent me my replacement which was taking way longer then 10 weeks, when i called again asking where my replacement was, the guy we talked to said there was no reason i should have even had that wait and that he'd make sure he sent a replacement for both dryers, and that they'd arrive in a timely manner. Which they did. Both replacements are dead. I switched back to my flat iron, which cost the same as one of those stupid driers but has lasted at least 4 years and still works like day 1."
1,Twice the effort for half the sleekness,"My hair is about 90% straight and 10% wavy, so you wouldn't think it takes much to make it sleek, straight and shiny; I even use an ant-firzz serum before I style. But using this Conair took twice as long as drying and straightening my hair in two steps, and gave me half as straight hair. I even used my regular blow dryer first to get most of the dampness out, thinking this would speed up the process...but no, it took ages. The Conair is basically a very small hairdryer with a few brush bristles. When I was finished, my hair definitely had frizz and fly aways, and I had to go back over it with my Chi flat iron. I really wanted to like this product and to save time, but I will be returning it."
2,Big Disappointment,"I have curly, frizzy hair and thought this would be a great product. It did not do a good job. My hair still had a frizz to it and it took awhile to dry. I returned it,I still do like conair products, just not this one."
1,Singed my hair after one use,"I used it just like it said, I brushed as it dried never leaving it in one place and after one use I found a section of hair that was burned.This gets too hot and their is no way to protect the hair shaft.It is going back and I will have to trim my hair"
2,not worth it,"If you have never used a flat iron before, don't even bother.This product does not come even close to the results I get when i use my flat iron. A waste of money, to say the least."
2,just ok,"the product started out working well but when i got 3/4 through styling my hair, the product started to have that burning smell. wouldn't recommend it"
2,Not impress at all,"I read the reviews and thought ok, I'll try it. I was very disappointed. A lot of the reviews said it was good for African American Hair. BEWARE! It almost pulled my hair out. WAY TOO MUCH STRESS ON MY HAIR! Thank you"
1,hirdryer,this is not what i wanted.i tryed to get a hold of someone to tell me where to send this back and no one could help me.they just shifted me around to some one else.i wont order again
2,not powerful enough,"In a nutshell, not enough wattage to get the job done in a reasonable amount of time. I'd also appreciate a shorter cord. I love the idea of this device, the straightening element works well for me. My hair is coarse and very wavy, always frizzy unless I straighten, so I really wanted to like this product. My friend who has finer, thinner hair than mine loves it. However, the 700 watt power makes styling take forever. I may as well dry and then iron, since it would be faster. Still, I'll probably keep this for travel, since it's very portable."
2,Not worth the price,"After reading the mixed reviews, I took a chance and bought one. It wasn't a total waste, but basically, it is a hair dryer. When I use it as directed, my hair still requires further streightning with an iron, though only about half as much as it used to. If I had it to do again, I would save the $50, and just buy a better brush to use with my blowdryer."
2,Does not straighten,When i used this all it did was smooth out my hair and added flips at the ends. It does not make you hair bone straight. As soon as you go outside your hair is puffy again. It does the same thing as my old $20 styler did. I guess using this to dry your hair and then use something else to straighten it would work. But why should i have to buy a second straighter when this thing suppose to do it for you. I also think the model on this box actually has naturally straight hair that is why it is so straight and smooth. Luckily i took it back and got a complete refund. I guess i will stick with my old straightner.
1,too little band and too much buck,Really only works with tension which is not possible at the ends of your hair. I would return it if I could. Very expensive for what you get.
1,dissapointed,it really hard to use this product unless you are an stailist. Also it take time to straighten the hair and at the end is frizzy. I'm very dissapointed and it was a waste of money.
2,not impressed,"it works ok and that's really all i can say, i just wasn't impressed. i already have straight hair and i thought this would help eliminate using a straightener, i just like having that shine and sleeker look, well it didn't really do anything a regular blow dryer wouldn't do. i don't recommend you waste your money."
5,Best hair appliance ever!,I have fine frizzy wavy hair. Flattening irons tend to leave my hair without any body. The Infiniti BC173 smooths my hair and still gives it some lift. It's very easy to use which I like since I don't enjoy spending a lot of time styling my hair. I've even used it when I've let my hair almost completely dry naturally and it has already started to be curly and frizzy and this dryer smooths it out. Amazing!!! I've been using it for about 3 years now and it still keeps working like new. I've been thinking about buying another one in case Conair quits making them. I'm sure the one I have won't last forever. I hate it when I find something that works this well and then the company stops making it. Hopefully that won't happen. I don't usually bother to write reviews but this product really deserves a good one.
4,Third time purchased,"I loved the first one so I bought one for my daughter. Then my original hair styler quit working after only a few months' use. I hope I have better luck with the replacement.I have long, thick wavy hair so I will give the product the benefit of the doubt. It is very effective in taming friz and waves. Now I can dry my hair in only a few minutes. Love the features of this dryer."
2,Don't get your hopes up,"I found this product at Target for around $50. I was so excited to buy it after seeing the commercial! I thought it was going to the answer to all my hair problems! Well, sorry.... nope. I'm not saying it was awful... but it took me a LOT longer than my usual routine which is quickly blow drying my hair and then going over it with a big-barrel curling iron. So it took longer, and my hair wasn't that smooth. Then I went outside and it immediately got wavy and frizzy. LUCKILY, I had asked the lady at Target when I bought it if I could return it if I didn't like it, and she said I could. So, back to the store it goes tomorrow!"
2,Don't waste your money,I bought this hotbrush with the hopes that it would shorten the time it takes to dry my hair straight. Well it does do that but you are left with a frizzy mess if your hair is naturally curly. The results are like using your hairdryer with a wide toothed comb and you still have to use your flat iron to smooth and straighten it out. All in all this product is definately not worth the money. Keep your blow dryer and round brush and save yourself $50.
3,Not Impressed,"My sister sent me this product to try out, she had bought it and did not like it. She doesn't separate her hair into sections, and I do when I straighten it and so she thought it might work better for me. I don't like it either. It dried my hair no problem and I love the idea of skipping a step, but it just doesn't straighten like my regular flat iron does. I have a chin length bob but my hair is fairly thick and slightly wavy.It may work better on finer hair, I don't know. Definitely try this product out before you buy it."
1,Total junk,I owned this for less than 2 weeks when it stopped working and began to smell like it was burning. I returned it for a refund.
2,AA Hair,"I purchased this hot air styler in hopes that it would dry my damp hair without damaging it! I now a lot about hair and haircare and I know that I shouldn't have had that much hair on my floor after using this thing. It dried my 60% air dried hair well and I liked the silky feel of my hair, it seems to seal the cuticles well. It doesn't get very hot but it gets hot enough to get the job done. But those teeth ripped my hair out! I'm taking it back. It's too damaging and I've put too much into taking care of my hair to allow this appliance to be my downfall! I have thick relaxed AA hair. Those teeth just aren't good for my hair!"
1,Terrible,"This product was so awful, I returned it - something I RARELY do. It didn't dry or straighten well. My dryer and round brush were far superior to using this. I don't recommend this product."
3,Still trying to figure it out...,"This is a tricky thing to use. I have medium length thick, curly, frizzy hair. I don't think that my hair likes this very much. It takes me a while to get one section dry and straight. I still have to go over my hair again with a flat iron to get the desired results. A little disappointed but I think much of the results depend on the type of hair that you have."
2,"Works fine, but highest speed setting broke already","This seemed to work fine, but within a few minutes of using it the higher speed setting broke. High speed and low speed are the same now, it doesn't go higher. Not sure how the rest of it will hold up, but I'll use it for now."
4,Nice product.,"The blowdryer arrived quickly and I'm satisfied with the product. I have really curly hair and the blowdryer gets it straight, however, I still have to use a flat iron to get it ""bone straight""."
5,Infiniti ROCKS!,"I've never been able to use the brush stylers so I was kind of skeptical about this one but it's a great hair dryer and straighter in one! Don't use it with your hair sopping wet though and you'll get better results. I have thick hair that's wavy, not super curly, so it works perfectly! Need to get a second one for the road!"
2,Ehhh...,"I really wanted this to work, but my fine hair was blown off the brush. My hair continued to be wavy and frizzy after use. It's going back."
3,Good Product/Bad Product,"It was the best of products, it was the WORST of products!! I have breezed through about 7 of these exact drying/straightening combs in the last 4 years; I obviously LOVE the item, its the life of the item that bothers me; shouldn't it last longer than an average of 3 months?? It starts to smoke and smell in a short time, then I buy another one - one thing's for sure, with such a poorly made but great product they'll always have job security!!"
1,EVEN MY HAIR STYLIST THOUGHT THIS WAS A LOSER,"I bought this product thinking it was the perfect answer for my shoulder length slightly wavy fine hair, to give me a sleek styled look. Wrong! I tried numerous times to use this ""styler"" and found it awkward and useless at best. At worst, I felt like I was damaging my hair! I even took it to my hair stylist to see if there was some technique I needed to use for better results. She was baffled by the poor design of this product as well. My advice? Don't waste your money."
2,Not what I was hoping for,"I was really hoping for a dryer that would get rid of some of the frizz and curls I started getting when I turned 30 - an unexpected and unwelcome byproduct of aging. This seemed perfect, but the dryer is so weak, it takes forever to dry my hair and virtually no straightening effect. After using it, I still have to straighten my hair with a flat iron. So I've gone back to drying my hair with a regular dryer (more power and therefore faster) and using the flat iron. I guess I should have known it sounded too good to be true."
2,Not for curly hair,The Connair *Infinity Pro Hot air brush did not work for me at all.Worst yet this merchant - D[...]- would not let me return it.The merchant had not stated that the product was not returnable.This brush would not work at all for curly hair.
1,not worth it...,It doesnt do anything to my hair but take an hour to dry it and make it frizzy. Doesnt do what it says it does. it makes it very poofy & frizzy.
3,If it was more staightner then blow dryer it might be better,"its ok, don't really like it because its more blow dryer then staightner. I would rather have just a straightner"
1,Doesn't straighten my hair,"I have extra long wavy thick hair. I've always wanted to be able to straighten my hair on my own without having someone else's help or going to a salon. This does dry my hair, but it doesn't make it straight, it always makes my hair frizzier and more dull. I would not recommend this product."
2,Baffled,"I ordered it, thinking it was something else, and then when it arrived, I was intrigued and had to try it. Okay, it will straighten but not certain the point of it. I can't use it to curl the ends and it seems a flat iron would do a better job. I used it once, didn't like it. Tried it the second time to see if I just wasn't using it right, and still wasn't thrilled. It is now in my dead heap pile of unused hair gadgets."
2,"I've ""killed off"" THREE of them!!","Have to admit, I don't read directions, but I did understand it was a HAIR DRYER in addition to a straightener and knew what to set the tension knob on. But I can't understand why I have just returned my THIRD one and this time didn't ask for a replacement. I was too scared! The last two times, the blower on the hair dryer just quit and I saw an ominous glow inside the appliance....right before it FRIED itself and a little puff of smoke came out!! I have to be doing something wrong, but what?Anyway before that happened THREE TIMES, I had been enjoying the results--I really only bought it to tame the frizziness on top of my head, but I did like that my hair was straighter and shinier, too. My hair is quite thick and a bit below shoulder-length.However, I can't risk buying another one because I'm afraid it'll catch my hair on fire or something."
4,fFinally a hair dryer that delivers for curly hair,"Now I don't have to worry about my arm getting tired, with thick and curly hair I had given up on the straight style. Thanks Infiniti!"
1,Not Pleased,This dryer is not meant for ethnic hair. My hair doesn't get any straighter than it did using a regular blow dryer and brush. I wouldn't recommend it for women of color.
2,Hairdryer,"My dealings with Nicholas at Foward Motion has been more than exceptional. The item purchase was not exactly what I imagined, but Nicholas worked with me in finding a product that met my needs. I commend his services and patience in working to resolve the needs of a customer.Respecfully,Yolanda"
3,"works great, but short life-span","I have medium thick hair with natural body. I love how this worked, BUT I've been through 2 so far, shopping for a third. They overheat too easily. My first burnt out in the first use so I returned it to the store. The 2nd lasted about 2 years. The internal fuse would blow after almost every use,then come back on later and I never used it on HIGH. This time, I'm buyingConair Infiniti Pro Nano Tourmaline Ceramic Ionic Hot Air Styler Straightener. It has 2 rows of ceramic teeth and looks a bit sturdier. We'll see."
2,Not worth the money,"This product isn't any better than the 10 year old curling brush I have under my bathroom sink. The kind girls used to feather their hair. It's a hairbrush that blows hot hair. Not at all what I thought it was going to be. You are better off going to the drugstore and getting a hot air styler ,some with changeable brushes for 10 to 15 dollars."
1,My hair looked horrible after using this.,"I have frizzy hair and use a straightener. When I read about this product, I thought it sounded like what I had waiting for all my life!It made my hair drab and flat. I will go back to my former styling method."
2,Not for my hair,"My hair is both thin (thanks to a thyroid problem) and very fine (since birth), and the blower is so powerful I can't keep the hair in the teeth to style it. For someone with somewhat coarser and/or thicker hair it might be fine, but for me it just doesn't work."
1,Not what I expected at all!!,"I puchased this product and was not happy with it at all!It is very sturdy and all that but after awhile using it - the handle is too heavy - which tends to put a strain on your wrist - i have long hair, straight hair and feel it for those who have this product and have curly, long hair - take it from me - if you insist of purchasing this product - get a wrist guard - cause after awhile you will feel the 'burn'.Hope this helps... I can surely say - i wasted my $$$$P.S. i would like to add - it last only 1 yr - used only 7 times out of that one year.."
5,This is the one!,My wife has owned and used this model since it first came out. It is the easiest one to straighten and style her very curly hair.
2,Defective,This item is the INFINITY DRYER / STRAIGHTENER BC173 Conair for hair.I have not had one disappointing issue with Amazon products. Unfortunately I ordered this item only three weeks before the second one. The first one burned up very quickly. I expect the second one to be better.
2,Not for Short Hair,"I didn't find anything any better about this than the Chi Mini Flat Iron that I already have.I followed all the directions and I couldn't style my short, somewhat wavy hair with it. Probably works best on medium to long hair, something the info for this failed to include."
1,"Does not work, electrical problem","Just received it, plugged it in after watching DVD and reading instructions but it would not go on; tried reset button etc. with no luck. Will have to send it back. I have purchased other Conair products over the years but this was a big disappointmnet because I didn't get a chance to use it."
2,A sad history,I was kinda disapointed by this film.Hardcore and punk can sometimes represent what is beatiful and what life should be about. But this film is just sad. To see these musicians talk about how many people they fought and how much cooler they were than the rest is not punk at all. Punk is freedom and what hardcore became is prison. The conformity they tried to escape is what they became in the end.
1,Too Many Omissions to Count...,"The name of the film is American Hardcore, but never once mentioned are seminal Hardcore legends Reagan Youth, Warzone and the Angry Samoans. The Dead Kennedys, Misfits, Husker Du, 7 Seconds and Suicidal Tendencies are briefly mentioned and in no way given their due. Much of the running time of the documentary focuses on the California, Boston and DC scenes. But how can you cover Cali in depth without delving deep into the Dead Kennedys? The film is completely disjointed and has no rhyme or reason as they move from California to Boston back to California to DC and then briefly to New York. I know the intention was good but the product is subpar and heinously omits bands that should have gotten their 15 minutes for their contributions to this important underground scene. Not recommended."
2,"A spotty, disjointed, incomplete mess","Fortunately I rented this from Neflix and did not buy it. I would not recommend that anyone who knows anything about or has any interest in American Hardcore buy this CD. First, it is impossible to document the history of this genre of American music without mentioning and focusing somewhat on the Dead Kennedys. DK was as important, if not more important, than Black Flag. This is a mess and should be avoided."
2,What?,"I agree 100% with reviews below that say this movie is basically just a disjointed collection of clips. Not having anything about bands like The Misfits and Dead Kennedys (to name 2) in this movie is a disgrace. And as a Canadian I take offense to the fact that they use Joey Keithley as a source for a lot of interview material, with no mention that DOA were a Canadian band. Not part of the American Hardcore scene at all. The movie is really just a disapointment."
2,CMON! could have been a bit better,Too much BOSTON!!!!!and other than the straight edge nod Boston's scene didntreally amount to much. Not enough LA..not even a SINGLE DK mention???? cmon
2,not so great,"An ok attempt at explaining what really happened during this era. Most of the concert footage was pretty unsatisfying for someone who was there. Bad Brains were depicted well and Keith Morris is always entertaining. The movie title references years 1980-1986 but I am not really sure why the only Gang Green concert footage was from 1987. There was no mention of Dead Kennedys, Social Distortion or Misfits which seemed strange."
3,Excellent study and history with one GLARING omission,"This is a good documentary; well researched and put together. Unfortunately, the film-maker pretty much skipped over the Dead Kennedys. To me, this is almost inexcusable.That being said, I would still recommend the DVD to anyone who was part of the scene in the early 80's or anyone who wants to know what it was all about."
4,"So much to cover, so little time","This was a very decent documentary focusing on the origins and the centers of the hardcore scene when it was at it's biggest and best. The story unfolds starting in california, and spending much of their time there, but eventually breaks off across the country into regional areas. Unfortunately, there was quite a bit of focus on some smaller less known bands, and omissions of details of the misfits, and husker du and other midwest influential bands. However, the choppyness of this film soley comes from the amount of material it has to try and cram into about 2 hours. The bonus features were nice, and Good Job with the Bad Brains and Black Flag stuff, but not the be-all end all of Punk/Hardcore knowledge. This film does definately catch the spirit of the movement. Definately worth a look."
3,good content....but.,"Overall this is an interesting look into the early years of the American HC scene. The interviews are great as are the still photographs but the ""cinematography"" leaves a bit to be desired. The technique looks a bit too A/V club for me but it is still worth buying."
3,I guess so,"Imagine going all the way to Minneapolis and the only person you can find to talk about ""American Hardcore"" Tommy Stinson? You can't even go find Grant Hart?"
2,Ugh,"Two-star rating for the live footage alone. Waaaaay too many douchebags are interviewed. Idiots/burnouts like Bruce Loose, Springa, Vinnie Stigma and Jimmy Gestapo make me embarrassed to be a fan of independent music in general. Jack Grisham is the biggest offender (""huh-huh, I'm cool and edgy because I pissed on a passed-out girl""). That's not a fault of the film though, as these people were idiots back then too, so it is historically accurate. I can't believe the short-shrift that the midwest got--some of the best bands came from that region. Oh well. Rent it for the footage. Oh, and HR looks really old."
4,Been waiting for a movie about this.....,"I thought it was a pretty apt, documentary style piece about this scene. This period in American music was extremely important to alot of people, myself included. And, I think it definately shaped how punk and metal became in this day and age. Great interviews, awesome, raw live footage, and some cool bonus features make this a must have for anyone who gave a damn about hardcore from 1980-85/86!!!!!"
4,Good to watch a couple times...,"This isn't necessarily something I could watch more than a couple times, but it was enjoyable. Like others have said, they did leave a lot out, however I think if they were to put in everything about East and West Coast hardcore it would have to be like a mini-series or made into 10 parts! So relax people and just know that other punk documentaries will come out and have come out and we can't expect to see it all in an hour and forty minutes. Besides that, this movie might just be the perfect movie for some kid to watch that will change his life musically and do for him what Punk did for you when you were a squirt. So think of this as a perfect introduction to hardcore, not the end all be all punk manual."
4,The one ink everyone should start with.,"I'm using this in a Lamy Safari. It starts right up on any kind of paper I've tried it on, including receipt paper at work. Flows smoothly from the pen without skipping. It's dull black, but perfect for professional situations or signatures with difficult paper. I'll buy again."
5,Top-shelf fountain pen ink,"Noodler's Black Bulletproof is my go-to ink for serious work. It's waterproof, fraud-proof, and will write well on any kind of paper. This is the only fountain pen ink I know that can be used for crossword puzzles on newspaper pulp without feathering or bleeding through. Once the ink dries on the page, it's not removable. I once ran a note through the laundry in the pocket of my jeans, and the writing was still perfectly legible when I discovered the washed piece of paper in the pocket later.This is well-behaved ink, with only one minor drawback: it exhibits nib creep in most pens. If you don't care about seeing a bit of ink riding the top of the nib as you write, this is not an issue, and the great properties of Noodler's Black more than make up for it.If you write with a fountain pen, and you want an ink that's smooth, waterproof, and rock-solid permanent once it dries, there's really only one pick...Noodler's Black Bulletproof."
5,great ink,"at first i was slightly disappointed as i thought it wasn't waterproof like it claims, but i later realized i must have had some old ink still in my pen barrel combining with the noodlers. completely satisfied with this product, just make sure you don't mix it with any other ink... it loses it's ""bulletproofness"" if you do."
4,Good Ink but NOT Waterproof,"Doesn't feather, with a sharp, crisp, dense line. Slow dries on quality paper where it tends to sit on top rather than be quickly absorbed (cheaper paper). But where it fails as a drawing ink is that it lightly lifts when a wash of water is applied. Even lightly will kill a watercolor or colored ink wash. As long as you don't care about it being absolutely waterproof, this is a great ink, but if you require absolute waterPROOF (as opposed to water ""resistant""), then this is NOT the ink you want."
5,Quality Ink.,Good ink. Just make sure you shake it. I've been researching the blue bullet proof ink as well. Main reason why I buy this particular ink (among the many Noodler's inks) is that this one is bulletproof. I learned that it is non-messy to use a syringe to refill the pen.
5,Great Fountain Pen Ink!!,"This is very good ink for fountain pen, and it has 3 oz compare to parker bottled ink only 2 oz and for almost the same price, and best of all, it is made in U.S.A!!!"
2,Takes a long time to dry,"It is nice to have a fountain pen ink that is water proof. However, in this particular case it is at the cost of having an ink that takes forever to dry. This it almost impossible to use for left handed people, and one must accept the fact that when writing on multiple pages, there will be ink smears on the pages that touch each other. It's definitely good to have when signing documents or checks, but one can use a simple permanent pen from any office store for that limited use. Buyer beware!"
3,"Misleading, not waterproof","-I've tried this on various types of paper, and no matter how long I let the ink dry, it still smudges very easily with a damp finger!-This bleeds through paper much more than the Montblanc inks-Doesn't dry fast enough. I often have to wait a minute for the whole page to dry before I turn the pageThe ink looks very solid and dark and I do like it; I'm giving it a 3 out of 5 mostly because of misleading ""waterproof"" label, and also because it bleeds easily and doesn't dry fast."
3,"good ink, a little too thick","Yes, every once in awhile the pen stops working, and I need to screw in the piston a little more. Ink has a nice feel when writing with it, so I am not entirely disappointed with it."
4,"Quality, economical, black ink","Noodler's bulletproof black ink is great for those looking for a true, deep black ink at an exceptional per ounce price."
5,a most excellent ink.,"This a most excellent ink. If you don't believe it, write on a piece of paper then submerge it in water overnight. It will not run and it will not fade. It's the only Ink I buy now. Excellent range of colors and ink options, eel, baystate blue, etc."
4,Best dye based fountain pen ink I've ever used.,"I'd say it's ""bullet resistent"" not bullet proof. Even when dry it will smear a bit if it gets wet. Still way better than most."
3,Noodler's and Nibs,"I think the colors run true. It works on any paper any of my other inks work on. My complaint is what this ink does with the nibs. While using any of my pens (I prefer Lamy, but have the same problems in my Visconti's, Pelikan, Parkers, and Cross)the ink spreads/feathers out slightly on the slit of the nib. Thus I have a dark line of ink running down the middle of the nib whenever I use Noodler's. I don't get this problem with any other brand ink ."
3,Not good for LAMY fountain pens (extra fine),"I purchased this ink to be used with my extra-fine point LAMY Safary fountain pen. At first I liked the deep black color but in a few days I noticed that my pen started to clog. Even though I kept cleaning my pen with warm water, it kept happening. I switched to LAMY ink and the problem completely went away.This ink might be great for other types of pens, but if you have an extra-fine point, consider getting a different one."
3,"Noodler's Fan, But Disappointed in Bulletproof Black","I have acquired an assortment of Lamy pens in various nib sizes and half a dozen different colors of Noodler's ink that I fill into the converter cartridges. I am a fan of Noodler's ink but not of this particular flavor - ""Black Bulletproof"" which I bought upon recommendations listed here on Amazon. It worked fine in a medium nib pen, but is terrible in an extra fine nib. Unlike other Noodler's inks that I use in an extra fine nib, i.e., Forest Green (wonderful ink), this particular black fails to flow well and leaves a torn, jagged line on just about any paper I try. I have just ordered a bottle of ""Heart of Darkness"" in the hopes I can obtain a consistently clean thin dark black line through an extra fine nib."
4,shopping experience,"The merchant delivered the correct product as presented to me by Amazon within the expected time. The packaging met with expectations. To summarize, this was a good shopping experience, but not exceptional: specifically, package shipment speed was ""within expectations"" and not faster than expected without additional expedited shipping expenses. A few rare vendors have presented me this kind of experience, and it therefore became necessary on my part to reserve five stars only for that level of service.My only disappointment -- and that is a personal matter, not as a result of any failing of the vendor -- is that the ink itself is not as black as I might like. If I cannot get absolutely black than I'd rather use blue ... a mild black is unappealing to me."
5,Excellent Value,"I bought this ink for use with a Cross fine nibbed fountain pen that I use on a daily basis in my work. This ink is excellent, it flows immediately and smoothly with no skipping. Its a very dark black that looks great on almost any grade of paper from the cheapest recycled copy paper to heavy cottons and linens. It also completely lives up to its bulletproof billing; for my own amusement I've tried everything from ammonia, bleach, carpet cleaner fluid, gasoline, kerosine, lighter fluid, etc and nothing I've tried will get this ink to budge from any paper I've used. Also, when they say 3 fluid ounces they mean it, the bottle is filled to the very brim so exercise caution or you'll spill some."
4,"Bulletproof, beautiful","$4 an oz is a good price for truly bulletproof ink. It's cheap, impossible to dissolve with any household solvents, and is safe for all ink-applicable purposes. Does what black ink should to. The ink comes off easily, making a beautiful glass bottle.cons: Bottle is not air-tight! It leaks if tilted excessively! Exercise caution, because this ink will never come out of cellulose. Ever."
5,"Excellent product, will continue to use this brand.","Ink is of excellent quality; does not run or easily smear. On most paper I do not require a blotter. Flows smoothly and consistently, and tint is very dark. Happy to find an inexpensive, high quality product made in USA."
5,Great product,"Used to fill up a Waterman. A bit messy since I haven't manually filled a fountain pen for a while, but the bottle seems to last several dozen fills easily (unless the cap does not seal properly and the ink evaporates, which seems unlikely given the quality of the bottle / cap).Great color consistency and richness."
5,Great Product,"As a college student I do a lot of writing in the form of notes and tests. I use my Lamy Safari pen with the converter and this ink. I love the deep color of it, its a nice dark ink. I don't have problems of bleeding through pages with regular store bought college ruled paper either so that means I can write on both side of a sheet and not worry about my notes turning in to a muddy mess. I will be buying this product in the future and I highly recommend it."
5,"A great, easy flowing, black ink","I use this ink in a Pilot Plumix with a converter (not exactly the most high brow pen) and it flows like a dream. The is nice and dark with out spidering out, even on some pretty crappy paper I have used. It cleans up pretty easily with water if it is spilled on plastic or other similar surface, but is very durable on paper. I haven't had any problems with smearing even a few moments after writing something."
4,Solid Ink,"This ink has impressed me in many ways.When you first hold it the glass bottle is of high quality. It feels sturdy and strong and doesn't feel like a cheap bottle. The print though does seem a little tacky on this bottle.Regarding the ink, it proves to be one of the most versatile products I have used. It does what it avertises, which is a big positive."
3,Liberté,"Lorsque le feu de la passion devient incontrlable, les flammes envahissent l'tre, le laissant brlant de désir jusqu'à ce qu'il se consume et devienne d'abord brasier, puis simples cendres.Attention, ce roman est chaud! L'histoire est pourtant banale. Une jeune élève tombe amoureuse de son professeur, marié, père de famille. Lui, s'est enfermé volontairement et depuis longtemps dans une vie médiocre, calculée, empesée. Elle, ne peut vivre qu'entièrement et avec comme seul but : la passion avec toute sa splendeur mais aussi avec tous ses risques!"
1,This translation from the French is HORRIBLE!,"Although I have not yet read the original French publications of these essays, I must express my dissapointment with this translation. Whoever did this job simply must have a far better understanding of the language than they do! As a native English speaker and as a student of the French language for four years now, I implore that far better work be done in the future to bring to the English speaking world the beauty of Camus!"
3,More interesting for the history than the philosophy,"Camus' quasi-coherent point takes a back seat to his insightful historical analysis. It's worth reading for the historical info, rather than his elusive point."
3,"Game is ok, not great","This game is fun for my daughters (ages 5,7,&9), but they much prefer Max, another cooperative game involving a cat."
5,We love cooperative games!,"Once you get over how cheap-looking the game is (so you may not want to buy it for a gift, if that would bother you), you'll realize how refreshing it is to play a cooperative game! My daughters loved working together to save the princess! Another friend likes playing it every time she comes over and has requested it for her birthday, so we're buying another.We also really like the ""Max"" game and ""The secret door"" from the same company. I think ""Max"" is the best game we've tried so far."
2,WRONG 1,SENT THE WRONG ONE-RETURNED IT -FOUND IT CHEAPER AT A DIFFERENT WEB SITE-GOT THE SAME BRAND (DASHMAT)OTHER SITE WORKS GREAT NO PROBLEMS
2,Highly disappointing,"I picked up this book with great excitement, only to be thoroughly let down. The plot was original, but very uninteresting and it seemed to go nowhere. Aside from that, the characters were also very poorly written. Silas was the only one in the story that I actually looked forward to reading about. Cherish to me was whiny and weak, and I found myself hoping she didn't win the love of Silas until she could change her spoiled ways. Her father did a complete 360 in the story, between paternal love and obsessive protection. He randomly over-reacted about Silas, which was not, in my opinion, part of his nature. The dialogue throughout the book was rushed and forced, the characters were extremely underdeveloped, and the end just left me unsatisfied. This one doesn't rank anywhere close to the author's first book, ""WILD ROSE."" There's such a drastic difference in the plot and characters that I'm somewhat leery to pick up the next one."
4,Lonely Planet is always a winner for me,I've used about 30 of these country guides and they will always be my first choice. This gave me very useable and current information for my trip. I like the information about the museums and Tivoli Gardens as well as transportation options. I never would have gone to the Louisiana Museum without it. Written in a pleasant style.
4,Multi-Site Pig Production,"D.L. Harris has summarized the advantages and challenges associated with multi-site production in an easy to comprehend manner. This book will provide readers of the science of disease transfer, weaning ages required to utilize the system to lower cost, and provide targets that the industry needs to remain competitive in the future. Dr. Harris shows the ""sytematic"" approach to making multi-site production successful and includes all aspects of the ""flow"" that must be adapted to making the system work. Bits and pieces or partial application may ad some benefit but a complete follow through will provide optimum results."
4,Good fit,"These pants fit great (I have a straight, non-hippy frame). Only problem is they fade pretty bad. Run true to normal jean/pant size. I'm 5'8"" and lenth is perfect."
4,Thorough review of the German revolution,Thorough review of the German revolution and the political considerations behind it. Deals primarily with fragmentation of the German socialist movement in socialdemocrats and communists.
2,Structurally sound but,"This is a good binder. I only did not work for me because the width only is enough to fit 8.5 x 11 sheets of paper. If you wish to include tab dividers the will protrude past the width of the binder. Also the expansion is limited in that you start from 3"" and expand to 5"" inches. The binder cannot collapse smaller than 3"". So as long as these two items are not an issue, it is sturdy and durable"
1,Immoral movie,"This movie could have been so good. The storyline was great and the relationship between Mr. Sorrell & his son is wonderful. However, there were lots of bedroom scenes. Leading character was very immoral and there was language. In the end, the son winds up euthanizing his father after the encouragement of his wife. Very dissapointed"
5,Great,"It has so many parts. Colorful. Very nice for small and even older children. My grandchildren love the animals, also how they can set it up. Great for take along!"
4,Entertaining tribute,"The celebration of Duke Ellington a century after his birth has produced a wealth of tributes and, thankfully, some fine reissues of his work. This CD takes a more contemporary approach to Ellington's music resulting in a sort of smooth jazz sampler of the Duke. It's a very entertaining approach with some stellar work by an all-star roster of artists. Well worth a listen."
5,A+ tribute to the Duke,The CD has awesome jazz vocals from some the greatest. Is has quickly become of my favorites.
3,Blackfoot,"I was fournate enough to see this line up of Blackfoot which turned out too be the last,not near as good as orgional Blackfoot material but it still ""ROCKS"" it shows what southern rock is all about!!!"
4,Commodores,"I love the commodores, I grew up listening to them. I really love the slow ones. Not so crazy about the fast songs."
5,ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS!!!!!!,i adore this book and hope you will give it a chance. because out of the three hundred books i have read this is one of my very favorites.
3,Better than other recent mt man titles,"Finally, a Johnstone book that isn't full of dozens of pagesof ""filler"" from previous titles in the series!Also, the editing has improved as few (any?) spelling mistakeswere present.As to the story, it focuses on a band of outlaws trying tostart an Indian war in order to sell guns to them. Smoke Jensenof course helps stop it, and kills a bunch of outlaws--standardMountain Man fare, though the book does not focus as much on Smoke as usual.If you like the Mountain Man series, I think you will find this enjoyable, especially since you won't have to skip through pagesof material from previous books."
1,"Unfortunatley, There Are No Grades Less Than One.","This is the last William W. Johnstone book I buy. It was a pathetically written story. Bad spelling, and they couldn't even keep the characters names right. Some of the dialog was disgracefully juvenile. Plus the prices are going up when they should be going down."
4,Johnstone No.2,Another gift for Dad. He also seemed happy with this one. The only downside is that he reads them so fast he's had to read other series by the same author to keep up.
3,Passable western,Mr Johnstone seems to stay with the same old script. Bad guys that turn good and good guys that are not really good after all.
1,poor product,I brought this product 7mths ago and it has been falling apart. Presently one of the legs of the chair has broke( crack into 2 piceces ) .I would like to know how do I go about contact the manufacturer about this matter .
1,tacky..,"I really expected a lot more from this set as it look really nice online, the table and chairs were damaged upon arrival, the chair leg is still broken because i cannot get a replacement, and they are so wobbly, please save yourself the money and do not order this set"
3,Same as other release,"Just purchased this item and was disappointed to find that it contains the same tracks as a previious releaseCleared for Take Off. Same tracks spread over 2 discs instead of 1 and in a different order. If you don't own Cleared for Take Off, this is a worthy purchase with pretty decent sound of a great band coming into it's own with songs recorded live in 1966 - 67,"
2,The Ultimate Movie Review! - [...] - @tss5078,"I'm a huge sci-fi fan and I love Jack Palance and Corky Nemec, but this movie was a snooze fest. The question I have for this talented cast is what the hell were you thinking?! Granted the effects are 20 years old, but the dialogue is laughable, it takes much to long to get into, and to be honest, it was just boring. I kept waiting for something to happen and when it did, I really didn't give a damn. Sorry, but this was terrible."
3,solar crisis,"I produced a laserdisc to vhs transfer at home a few years back. It was a pristine widescreen copy. Later, I transferred the vhs copy to dvd. The result is a sharp,5.1 decodable audio widescreen version which makes a lot of viewing difference.Give this somewhat plot imperfect flick another look if it ever is available on dvd in widescreen.The Jack Palance-Heston's grandson subplot is fun too."
3,"I liked it, but not for the reason you think.","Obviously this is not a great piece of work, the Japanese producers wanted to make an American Science Fiction movie, they just didn't know how. All of the elements are present, they just didn't blend correctly. It is however one of those movies you can't resist stopping and watching when you are channel surfing. It may not be worth the 90 minutes you lose, but if you don't have anything better to do with them then you will enjoy this movie. It is a must however for anyone who wants to make movies. It had everything going for it and it failed."
1,The Worst SF Movie I ever saw.,"It was the first time I ever felt a need to fast forward through a video and even then I couldn't stand to watch it. Fast forwarding through all the action on earth I was dumbfounded by the impossible plot on the space ship. Special effects or not, this movie is not worth paying for, I didn't - (checked it out of the local library).Take a hint from the Director credit: Alan Smithee - the real director did not even want his name on it."
1,A high budget Sci-Fi mess,"The first sign that this film is no good is it's directed by ""Alan Smithee"". ""Smithee"" is a psudonyum for directors who want to disassociate themselves from a finished picture. Too bad the stars didn't have the same luxery: Peter Boyle, Jack Palance, Charlton Heston, Tim Matherson. The hard-to-follow story deals with evacuation of Earth during a probable supernova of the Sun (I think) but what you really get is an unstable bastardization of ""2001"" and ""Road Warrior"". This film may have impressive special FX but the best visuals in the world don't mean a thing if you don't have a halfway decent story to go with it."
1,Exploding bomb!,"I would actually give this ""film"" no stars. Quite possibly, next to a few others, this has to be one of the most convuluted, boring and sickening movies to watch. Want the storyline? Refer to the title, and thats about as exstensive as it gets. I own this on laser disc and have wanted to burn it for years. So many quality films being excluded from dvd and this pile of junk gets released. Too bad alot of good actors got caught up in this mess, but they are just as responsible. Man, this is bad, dont waste a dime on it."
1,I did not even finish this book,"I was told that Amanda Cross was a good mystery writer and looked forward to reading some of her works. After reading 4 of these short stories, I put the book down and will not look for any more of her works.I tried to over look the excessive use of fractured compound sentences, but the bizarre resolution of the stories was more than I could bear."
4,I live where Munson Lived..,"A magic experience for me to read this work. Munson lived in myarea of Texas, I know both authors and the history of wine is ofinterest to me . . BRAVO! Munson is a US legend and I was gladto find it from Amazon so I could fill in the blanks of my knowledge."
5,FIRST RATE THRILLER,"John Dahl should smash the box-office one of these days because he truely deserves it. Unforgettable is his best work effort, a gripping suspensefiul script supported by an excellent cast and a director who knows how to keep you on the edge of your sofa. The Dolby Digital track is very dynamic and does justice to Christopher Young's remarkable score. This widescreen edition is not anamorphic, as marked on the back cover, but the image is sharp."
5,I love to watch Mr. Liotta act....,"It is a pleasure to watch him act and how he responds to each scene, and how he responds to everthing around him and how he wants the scene to be understood and the emotions he wants the viewer to feel....this is a good movie if you know what you're looking at."
2,Interesting Piece Of Info....,"Did you know that Motown's studio band played on this album and on ""Whispers""?? On ""Higher And Higher"", that bass at the beginning could be no one other than James Jamerson. I knew that there was some reason that I keep coming back to this, this recording always stuck with me ever since I first heard it upon its release in 1967(particularily the title track). And Jackie is at his peak on this recording, I feel. For me, Jackie's performance on the title track and the Funk Brother's playing gives it 5 stars(Please ignore the 2-star graphic, that is an error. 5 stars!!)"
5,gret album from Mr.Excitement,Jackie Wilson was one of the baddest Musical artists ever. the Man was smooth and could Sing/Sang with the best of them. he was in the same class as Sam Cooke and James Brown back in the day. He truly had a unique style about him. this album is smooth and on time. the Motown band is on here and Jackie is leding the way. the Man could sing anything and make it sound so smooth. a Must have. the Brother is so underrated.
5,Solid,"I took this book from a neglected stack in an Acupuncturist's office, and was struck by the repugnant cover (imagine the worse possible detail job on a van from the 70s - it was an earlier edition than the one you see on Amazon). But the information is solid. Good understandings of time, healing, choice and destiny are woven throughout the material. Simple exercises are presented with direct and encouraging language that does a good job addressing the problem of doubt.Not at all pertinent to this book, yet Interesting to note: this Amy Wallace is the author of The Sorcerer's Apprentice, a memoir of her years as a follower of Carlos Casteneda."
1,Warning do not buy highpoint product,"I was originally sold highpoint rocketraid cards from a company that I buy my hard drives from. Highpoint implements a technology where one must use a browser to log onto the hard-drives in order to mount them, format them or do anything else with them.The trick is that sometimes the password works, sometimes not. So I am locked out of my own hard drives. This has happened several times to me. So far today I have been sitting in front of a dead computer for 8 hours waiting for Highpoint to return my tech help call - I have left 5 messages.In order to switch cards I must wipe out all my data. Which I am going to do as the frustration level of not being able to access my own hard drives is horrific. This company is basically holding me hostage. I have offered to pay them money just to answer the phone - no luck.Be warned. Stay away."
2,Boring,"these movies are sssssoooooooooooooooo boring they try to be cool, but they are not. If you want to see them RENT them. they are not worth buying. Trust me I am a transformer fan. I've bought old transformer toys for $200.00. The story line of the shows are ok, but only ok. I could make the story line better. A lot better. Thank you so much for reading my review. Please dont think all transformers are boring. ..."
5,"""Till all are One""",One of the best cartoon movies to be made in my time.Transfomers The Movie if you didn't see it as a kid you have a chance to make up for it and do yourself a favor and buy this movie the price is great.
5,Everything I expected,This movie is everything I expected it to be. Certainly brought back memories from my childhood. The extra features are very nice. A must buy for any and all Transformers fans.
2,A waste of money!!!,"I remembered watching this movie as a kid and really enjoying it. However, after rewatching the Transformers Season 1 4 disc DVD set, this movie pales in comparison. The characters lacked personality and didn't look as interesting as the others. I recommend that you save your money and put it towards the more expensive, but more enjoyable, DVD box sets."
2,More Than Meet The Eye!,"What else I can said, this is the best movie I ever seen from ""The Transformers"" series. All of my favorites are in this movie, including my favorite hero of all time Optimus Prime. I felted sorry when he went down the flick but the movie just keep better and better till the end. This movie is worth the money buy it because you never if you ever see this greatest cartoon series of all time. ""Autobots transform"""
4,Transformers movie is the best animated movie ever,"The transformers movie is truely a great movie. It mad me laugh, it made me cry. I just wonder what happens to Optimus Prime's trailer when he transforms? The only thing that would make this movie better would be if the big transforming planet won and all the transformers died."
1,"BOOOO, two thunbs Down!","it was an EXCELENT movie but distroyed by Rhino. they Cut sceans, they Changed the movie, there are barelly NO extra features, and it is a bad transfer. this is just very disapointing. sorry to break it to you all but this is not worth the time or Money."
1,ATTENTION! NOT WHAT YOU THINK!,The movie itself is FANTASTIC BUT beware that this is NOT the original 1986 movie. It's the Special Collectors Edition that's been remastered and includes foul language. The only way you'd know that is if you happened to mouse over one of the extra thumbnail images (and who does that?!).
2,Optimus Prime is a wuss lol,"Maybe it's because I never saw this as a child (yes, I grew up in the 80's) but I didn't like this movie. I think what really ruined it for me was the music. It made me role my eyes every time I heard the annoying 80's rock blaring at me when there was an action scene. It really dates the flick. But, I'm sure if this had been part of my extensive cartoon watching as a 6 year old, I'd be praising it like everyone else."
1,Pure Boredom,"I tried to watch this movie a couple of months ago. I am sorry. I see no sorry. It's a series of unrelated events and unanswered questions. Ugh. I don't see why people love this movie. Even if you are a Transformers' fan, you have to realize that this movie is sooooooooooooooooo boring. I had a hard time trying to watch this movie a second time.If you want real stories, check out Beast Wars and Beast Machines. Now that is entertainment."
1,"Parents, keep your children away!","My child attempted to transform into a semi truck like the much lauded ""Optimus Prime."" He has not been able to stand up straight since 1986. It was weeks before we were able to detach the trailer. The Transformers are more than meets the eye, they are a disaster in disguise."
4,"Excellent, now I can die partially happy.","It is about time that this movie is released on video again. I takes me back to the good old days when cartoons were done by hand. The Gem and The Holgrams Advertisement scared me. And what was with the hokey Star Wars-like intro that was added in? And the voice over at the end detracted from this much anticipated film. This film-of-films must be released on a DVD format. I'll wear out the tape to fast. A must for Tranformer fans, young and old."
5,it was the best cartoon movie ive ever seen,"i saw it a long time ago, and have been looking for it ever since. all i can say is that i loved it and i wish i owned it."
5,Greatest Cartoon Ever,"Okay. I am 13yrs old..and I have watched this movie since I was 2 EVERY day. When this comes on DVD(IF, OF COURSE IT WILL!!)I am getting it and taking it everywhere..MAN OH MAN This is a great movie..Think of it as a real movie with robots only animated. Most of my favorite characters died..but of course this came last after the real series..then the cartoon show that took place right after the movie..think of Transformers as a never ending universe...5 stars. Great. BUY IT! Best movie ever!"
3,Falsely criticized...a good effort...very entertaining,"Considered by critics and film buffs as being one of the weakest and most subtle bombs of the 1980's; The Transformers the Movie is a very well made and highly enjoyable animated film that actually improves with each viewing. Probably one of the most handsome voice talent ensembles in the industry (this was Orson Welles final film) and well paced (and even very well directed) action sequences make it worth viewing. There is a lot to be found fault with, but fans of the television series will eat it up. It's great to see it finally being rereleased after all these years."
3,Not so Special Edition,"We all know the movie is great 5 stars. This is for the ""Extras""1. Scramble City - It is Scramble City with 2 D-Bags talking over it. How about the Japanese audio and subtitles? Even the fan dub. I don't care about fan commentary.2. Deleted Scenes - Same thing. Talking over the whole thing.3. Commercials - Pretty good. No D-Bags on this.That's all."
5,Took me back to my childhood,"If you are a true Transformers fan, you will appreciate the movie, commentary and extras that were included in the DVD. This is truly a prize for Transformers fans of all ages!"
4,"Awesome, Classics 80s Cartoon Movie","I didn't remember how much I missed watching cartoons until I sat down to watch The Transformers - The Movie. I forgot how devastating Unicron was, and how Optimus Prime was the ultimate leader. Megatron was a vicious adversary and Starscreen was as conniving as ever. I liked the movie, the graphics were pretty good considering this was done back in the 80s. I wish that the movie could have been digitally remastered, but otherwise the quality is excellent. This is perhaps one of the greatest cartoon movies of my childhood. This a must have if you're an 80s baby.."
4,Transformer (Cartoon),"I gave this product as a Christmas present and got a fantastic response. I have watched it and it is great. The cartoon is a great review and just plain fun to watch before or after watching the new ""Transformers"" movie.DO ENJOY!!!!"
4,Looking back,"When you look back on something from your childhood and remember how absolutely spectacular it was to rush home evey afternoon to see your favorite cartoon, then revisit it in adulthood, more often than not you may be disappointed.Transformers the Movie still delivers, from its theme song to the death of your favorite characters. This was a great purchase."
4,Awesome... But....,"3 reasons why this could have been better.1. ""the touch"" MTV music video is missing and has never been released2. The interviews could have been more extensive. At this point the voice actors are the most interesting, mysterious factoid left to exploit. Who are they? are they still alive? What are they doing now and will they be involved in the next film?3. Sorta changing lanes but.... Why didn't Sony BMG re-release the soundtrack remastered on CD?"
1,one of the worst movies I've ever seen,"Even considering the fact that this movie is 25 years old, it's still bad. There are plenty of other animated movies from that era that are ten times better than this. I stopped halfway through watching this with my kids because I just couldn't bear it any longer. The animation is poor, but I can write that off to its age. The story is horrendous, with plot holes too numerous to count. On top of that, right in the middle of this movie I thought was geared for kids one guys yells an expletive at the top of his lungs. I don't recommend this for anyone."
5,excellent,"Every male from the age of 20 to 25 should love this movie. I remember watching this when I was in kindergarten, and have wanted it ever since. I am so excited that the DVD is finally coming out. I think this movie will make an excellent gift. It also sheads some light on the new transformers that is out now and provides background for that series."
4,Transformers: The Movie,"Great movie with a great soundtrack. One thing I liked about it is that The Autobots and Decepticons didn't join forces to destroy this evil menace called Unicron, like so many other stories do when indroducing a third party that threatens to wipeout both sides of good and evil. Now if only it can be released to DVD with a bonus feature of having the music video The Touch performed by Stan Bush on it."
5,"The best American animated movie, PERIOD.","This has got to be the best animated movie of all time. You can't get better story, animation, soundtrack, voice acting... With numerous stars as the lead roles this movie delivers. If you are looking for fast paced action, lots of cool robots and great animation look no further."
4,Nostalgia for the right price,"I was 10 when I saw the movie the first time in the theaters. I relived that experience when I bought this DVD. It is full screen, not letterbox or widescreen. Sound is crisp and clear with full bass response. Video is sharp and colorful. Arcee looks better than ever. Special features are lacking (no trailers) but it still rocks just the same!"
4,Good '80s action cartoon,The movie is a classic as the animated cartoons in the mid eighties that I follow every day.The Autobots led by Optimus Prime must fight the evil Decepticons led by Megatron in a battle that is stablished on Earth after the Decepticons forces Autobots to travel across space from their home planet Cybertron to Earth.This long feature is quite different from the episodes that I saw in Spain.There's violence in form that the leader of Autobots is killed by Megatron and after its succesor which makes me cry when I see it.The plot is good with good f/x.Good dvd.
4,"More than meets the eye, baby!","Today, my best friend Mike brought over Transformers: The Movie. I was excited to see it since I watched the cartoon when I was a kid, and had two action figures of my own. They were Decepticons (I had the original Megatron, but every time I wanted an Autobot, toy stores were always sold out). The whole movie has an 80s look and feel about it. The animation shows its age and the soundtrack is totally power rock 80s (Not that I'm complaining). The storyline was interesting enough to hold my interest, and I liked the one-liners in the movie. This one really took me back to my simplier childhood. The times of when you could come home after school and watch Heathcliff, Inspector Gadget, or Transformers. I really liked the time warp back to the 80s that this film gave. Eric Idle's character was extremely funny as well. The ending was somewhat of a letdown though. I wanted to see more, but I was satisfied with what I watched. A nice rainy day flick."
4,"Must have for fans, Should have for others","The Transformers started out as one long commercial for the toy line, but the release of this movie signified its rebirth as a classic series. The movie is great, with action and humor applenty, and is thankfully written by americans, so those tired of anime need have no fear. If you're looking for romance, look elsewhere; this movie is for those looking for 86 minutes of good entertaiment. Note to parents: This is only a midly violent movie, with robots getting beat up and dying, but beware the version released in Canada, with graphic human violence and language."
4,"A Fun Movie, But Only If You're Into This Sort Of Thing","Considering this cartoon is 20 years old, it's still a fun movie to watch, but if you're not into the Transformers world, you probably won't care for it. It comes with both widescreen and fullscreen formats, and the extras are all pretty neat."
4,neat-o,cleaned-up movie that's brighter than the original. great to see again...better than the transformer's live action movie.
2,this is a great film for Rodimus Prime fans!,"It was August 8, 1986, the release date of the very first Transformers movie. It had all the orginal characters : Optimus Prime. Megatron, Ironhide, and Starscream. It was terrible to see them die. But this film actually started the post-movie series of the show. It featured the new characters. The next Autobot leader, Rodimus Prime! It was great to see Judd Nelson's character Hot Rod mature into the adult Robot, Rodimus Prime! If you want to know how RP was born than this is the movie for you! Go Rodimus! RP is called Rodimus Convoy in Japan."
3,Great Story and Animation...Terrible Music,"The soundtrack of this movie is so cheesy and corny that it keeps this movie from being a classic. The animation and story are great and the characters are well done, but please re-release this dvd with an option to just have the dialogue and sound effects and avoid those horrible songs. And having the bonus feature be an interview with the guy who recorded those songs is insulting."
2,They killed Prime,"I saw this movie when I was 10 and was traumatized by how they killed Prime, Star Scream and many of the other characters I'd loved from the series. It was a very poor way to handle the story."
3,Some things don't improve with age,"I loved this movie when I saw it in the sixth grade...the first 10 minutes are almost repeated exactly in flashback. I guess I didn't notice that the first two times.I seemed to remember the final battle between Optimus Prime and Megatron a mega-war in itself. It wasn't much of anything the second.While it had a talented cast of voices, they didn't contribute much to the story. Leonard Nimoy didn't even seem to take his part seriously. Just scream in the mic and get out, and don't call me Mr. Spock, seemed to be his motivation.On the good side, the animation was superb, even more impressive for the times, before the digital revolution. The soundtrack was also very good and fitting for the movie.I'll always remember the Transformers fondly; they were an integral part of my boyhood. But there's more important things now, and the Transformers certainly aren't one of them.I guess some things don't improve with age."
2,This movie has beautiful Japanese Animation!,"This movie was done by top notch Japanese Animators. It is so pretty, you could reach out and touch a Transformer. The voice cast include Judd Nelson, Leonard Nimoy, and Orson Welles in his last movie performance. Peter Cullen plays Optimus Prime. There is also wild special effects and lighting that is so breathtaking! To anyone who loves Japanese Animation I recommend this movie!"
1,Awful DVD,"A lifetime TF fan of the original series, the movie was a classic, when I first saw it August 9, 1986. I wish the new characters didn't have to be introduced by killing off the favorite characters. It was awful to see fire spewing out of Prowl's mouth, when he was killed. And Ironhide's head being blown off by Megatron. I just saw the Kid Rhino DVD, and it was the sorriest way to bring a classic movie to DVD. The colors were too bright, and the animation was choppy. Besides the interview with the composer of the music, this DVD didn't have any features. It was just sloppily thrown together, just to get a DVD of the movie out there. I hope in the future, Paramount (Who is filming the new Transformers movie) gets in touch with Marvel/Sunbow, and re-release the original film, complete with trailers from the original film, plus toy commercials, featuring the movie characters. This is one movie, Kid Rhino, should have never put their hands on. This DVD sucked!!!!"
1,Memories,"Yes, this is one of those movies you can never forget about. Most of us that grew up in the 80's remember this movie. Truly, this is one that i don't regret buying. Now that it is a part of my dvd collection, i can enjoy it over and over again. It can now be enjoyed by the next generation of kids can enjoy it as much as we all did when it came out."
3,A quiz to see if you'll like this,"Not familiar with the Transformers and want to know if you'll like this? Try these five questions.Do you like Saturday morning cartoons? Do you like old video games? Do you like Journey, Styx, AC/DC, other miscellaneous 80s rock and 80's video game music and think that mixing them nonstop for an hour and a half would be really cool? Did you think the dialogue in Star Wars was too complicated? Do you like bright colors more than plot and logic?If you answered yes to all five, you'll love this movie."
2,The Transformers - The Movie DVD,I bought this DVD Because I really liked the original series and actually have been waiting for the movie to come out on DVD. When I got it home to watch it I was somewhat disappointed as to the quality of the video. I am not a video/audio expert but I do know a good picture when I see one. The sound was good. I would have thought that the Features on the DVD would have been better. While the interview with the music composer was there interesting in some spots I found the whole thing B-O-R-I-N-G ! The director would have been better. If you but this DVD then do it for the movie sake. Not for any thing else and be willing to be satisfied with the movie alone or buy the video tape if you can find it.
2,Terribly Disappointed!!!! Curse Words!!!!,"I purchased this movie for my 7 year old twin boys birthday thinking that because it said the rating was PG that it would be fine. Also, the market for Transformers is huge with boys their age and the toys being sold everywhere. Wow, were we hugely surprised to hear curse words on this cartoon movie. These were not just words like shoot or dang, but the real deal. I remember Transformers when I was growing up and I certainly do not remember their being foul language in the cartoons. I am going to take this matter up with higher management and at least get my money back and try find out what they were thinking. Who knows what the rating will end up being for the upcoming movie at the box office.Concerned in Alabama"
4,Looking for the Perfect Gift for Your Boyfriend?,"Hi there! I purchased this tape as a gift for my boyfriend. If your's was a kid in the 80's, and you get this one for him, I can tell you that you'll be thrilled with the gleam in his eyes when he opens this one!So if you were thinking about an expenisve watch that you could brag to your girlfriend's about, at least think of buying him this piece of his childhood, that HE can brag to the boys about. And if you want to be a really good girlfriend, watch it with him, and let him tell you which of the toys he had as a kid, I am SURE he will! :)"
2,what the heck on the price,i bought the movie when it came out for 17.99 and now they want 112.99 for it that a rediculous price that you be dumb to pay for wait it will be releace again
2,Really just 2 full-screen versions,"Well I bought this DVD yesterday and was really excited to finally see the ""theatrical widescreen version"" of the film, not having seen it since 1986. So I pop in the first disc and start playing. I then start to realize...this isn't a true widescreen version! It's just the full screen version reformated to play on a 16x9 television! And actually when you compare them side by side, the widescreen version cuts off some of the image.Sure the colors are separated more but really I think I liked the colors of the original better. Sometimes the new version just seemed...washed out. The original had deeper reds and looked more natural. I was kind of used to Unicron being almost orange and not yellow.Some of the extras are good, but not overly exciting. If you are looking for the true theatrical widescreen version prepare to be disappointed. Oh well now I have 2 full screen versions and 1 full screen version that plays natively on a widescreen tv."
5,classic,"one of the best movies from my childhood. I remember going to the theater to see it when if came out!( the theater isnt there anymore, its a Layzboy store now.)"
5,Transformers-The Movie is just AWESOME!,"This movie is the best cartoon ever. Autobots Vs. Decepticons in the war for Earth Megatron's plan after he already won Cybertron from the Autobots. And if you really want to see Optimus Prime and Megatron fight, this is your movie. And of course we can not forget about Orson Welles's voice as the evil monster planet Unicron. This is a must see movie for all ages. ( Including the uncut version too ). To find it you can search The Transfomers The Movie. ..."
5,small correction,"as any knowledgable ""transformer kid"" will tell you, altough i am now no longer a kid... SoundWave is NOT an autobot he is a deceptacon. Just a fix for all you transformer guru's who were angry. 8-) there problem solved"
5,Transformers the Movie,"If you were a kid during the 1980's and you loved Transformers like I did, this is a must own."
5,The best version of this film on DVD yet!,"To drum up publicity for the live-action Transformers movie next year, Sony Pictures has given the 1986 animated movie the deluxe treatment. This two-disc version promises a remastered, anamorphic widescreen transfer with ""corrected colors"". No word yet on a remastered 5.1 audio track to go with that improved picture. Sony does include a fullscreen version of the film as well as a third version that borrows from VH1's ""Pop-Up Video"", adding interesting facts about the movie and other Transformer-related information while the movie plays. Other special features include toy commercials from back in the day and a commentary track with producer Nelson Shin and voice actress Susan Blu, who was the voice of ""Arcee"". If you're a fan, this is a no-brainer. Pre-order today!"
3,Could be better,"Overall, I'd say this is one of the better DVD's I own, in terms of quality. Not content. Where is all the extra stuff that we've come to expect in a DVD movie? This version needed more than just an interview with the composer and some unused story boards. Where's the interviews with the cast? Or the director? I think Rhino could have spent a little more time on this version. I had to give it 3 stars. It's good, but a little lacking."
3,"I'd like my nostalgia with extra cheese, please ...","This 90-minute commercial disguised as a kiddie flick seems somewhat less reprehensible in retrospect, now that most of the relevant product lines have been discontinued. But the animation is still cheap, the dialogue is still laughable, and the story is still incoherent. In short, _Transformers_ is perfect midnight-movie fodder, especially for children of the '80s (who'll also enjoy the nostalgia and the inappropriate hair-metal score).The DVD features a solid full-frame video transfer with good sound, a nice animated menu, and even a few special features. It's a much better package than the film has ever received, or probably deserves.For trivia buffs, this movie features the possibly recognizable voices of Judd (""the Dud"") Nelson, Scatman (""Hong Kong Phooey"") Crothers, Robert (""Unsolved Mysteries"") Stack, and Leonard (""Spock!"") Nimoy. _Transformers: The Movie_ was also the final screen performance of Orson Welles. Sic transit gloria mundi."
4,Great Movie! Get it!,A great movie. Sure... some things go unexplained and are out right funny... but hey... optimus prime and megatron fight to the death!
5,Amazing!,"Quality is amazing, looks brand new even though it was listed as Very Good. Shipped same day as order, and came earlier than expected. Extremely satisfied with my purchase and glad I chose Knick Knacks!"
3,"Great movie, crummy DVD","This is definitely one of my favorite anime. It doesn't seem as good now as I thought it was when I was a little tyke though.However, if you already have the VHS version, there's no reason at all to buy the DVD. The only good part of this DVD is the neat looking menus. The extras are nothing special; just an interview with the guy who did the music and some storyboards. The worst part is that you can't view the movie in widescreen. Also, the sound is kind of messed up because the music gets louder and softer at weird times. The only reason you should buy this DVD is if you don't have any other version of this movie at all."
3,Transformers: The Movie,"Yes, it's everything you remember. Good audio, video. However, that is about it. The Extras are pretty bland. It makes you wonder if anyone was even interested in making this DVD. They call it the ""Special Collectors Edition"" but, there isn't anything too special about it. Very little to offer.But its all about the movie right? Well that's good, intact, great transfer, and no sound altering by Rhino like they tried on their release of the entire series on DVD (really bad move).If you grew up with it, get it. But if you expect something special, well, it's not there."
3,Bah weep bah na weep ninny bong!,"I was a bit disappointed in the movie when it was first released in 1986. Not only was Optimus Prime killed off (but later revived), but a lot of my favorite characters (Skywarp. Thundercracker, Prowl, Ratchet) were killed off as well! I think more extras should have been added like interviews with some of the voice actors, or even include the music video of Stan Bush's ""The Touch"". (Yes, there was an actual music video! I have it on tape. I don't think it was ever played much on MTV.) But overall, it is nice to have the movie on dvd."
4,Understandably a cult classic,"I like this movie a lot, despite, or maybe because of, its flaws. Any movie based on a cartoon series and toy line that has several of its cartoon and toy characters killed off is destined to become some kind of classic. However, any claims that this film's animation are superior to Disney's are completely ludicrous, though I suppose Disney would be unable to make a film like this, for other reasons."
4,Transformers,"Robots Die. Robots get eaten.Big Demon looking Robot. Great Movie. Buy it, if you like The Transformers."
5,Just a tiny point,"Yeah I'm sad for pointing this out, but maybe there's loads of others have too,I just haven't been botherd to check. Soundwave wasn't an Autobot as the editorial comment states, he was a Decepticon as far as I can remember."
3,This DVD is a Ripoff!,The Movies were great but the extras sucked. I was hoping to see scramble city with japanese dialouge with english subtitles and all you get are stupid fan boys saying why didn't that episode air over here in the states and other stuff i really dont give a damn about. also the commercials are terrible quality and for some strange reason they keep blurring the kids faces. the promotional trailer didnt have to have commentary either.is this a Real sony DVD or a bogus fan boy version. The deleted footage were just crappy 3 or 4 second clips. Not worth the buy you'd be better off with the Rhino Version.
1,...,"Well, I just bought myself Transformers on DVD. Giggling like an idiot and running to my DVD player I was absolutley shocked when I threw it in. No extras whatsoever. Not even a theatrical trailer. Pan and Scan only ?!?!! Augh! Could it get any worse? Yep. The sound is horrible. Hissy and muted. The Video isn't incredible, either. on Par with the VHS copy. Perhaps slightly crisper. I'm not sure if I got a different version. It has a different cover than what's shown here on Amazon (I bought mine at a local video store) This version is released by a company called Seville and Sports a cover like the VHS Release froma few years back with Optimus. Needless to say. I was incredibly dissapointed. Disgusted, even."
1,Glam rock ruins the world!,"I love Transformers and this movie could have been pretty cool like all of the televized cartoons, but the music makes it UNBEARABLE!"
5,"Without the shadow of a doubt, the greatest animated film ev","First of all, in response to anyone who dismisses the graphics as mediocre,.. this film was made in the mid-eighties...I believe that when you look at it in a more relevant eye, it more than holds it's own. It's a great period piece. The visual esthetics are nothing short of artistry. Imagine someone seeing Orsen Welle's visual masterpiece 'Citizen Kane', and putting it down for not having any color... Also, whether you prefered if Optimus Prime didn't die or not has no bearing on judging the quality of the film. It's unbelievable to me how ignorant some people are..."
1,disappointed by this board game,"I bought this game because it promised a ""green"" experience for the entire family. i must say, i was highly disappointed. is it called ""green"" because you are dealing with vegetables? So be it. My family could not find any interest in this game, not even my four year old whom we bought the game for. I did not find the added value of this game. don't waist your money on this."
3,Ambiguous,"It was a good treatise yet after reading this, I wonder what it was that i just read. The book will be remembered for its isolated ingenius points rather than a book as a whole. I read this for a class."
1,couldn't cancel order within a minute of ordering.,i accidently ordered twice and couldn't cancel one of the orders. now i have 720 pills that will no longer be fresh after one year. very upset about the service!!!
5,Brings Evolutionism to it Knees!,"Straight to the Jugular! Dr. Sarfati, clearly demonstrates to his readers that evolutionism is nothing more than a belief system, and therefore inaccessible to empirical science. A must read for anyone who is truly a ""freethinker"" or someone, who just wants to know what vital information has been censored in ordered to keep evolutionary interpretations and beliefs alive. After reading this book, you will understand evolution so well you will know why it is an absurd interpretation for the origin of the world and the life on it."
1,Statistics,It would be an interesting and informative exercise for both sides of the creationist/evolutionist debate if someone could produce some statistics on the proportion of readers of this sort of publication were bought to the fold of the lamb by it and the proportion who on reading it realised that the writer and many of his adherents had very real problems and were led to the assumption that all Christians were that way inclined and decided that they wanted nothing to do with them or their beliefs.If only from a crass marketing point of view the churches should give this some consideration if they are tempted to go along with these people with the intent of making new converts.Brian Giles
1,Evolution is true,"Science in no way refutes evolution, if used correctly. The authors of this book don't have an inkling of what 'science' is. If you're thinking about buying this book, do yourself a favor and go buy ""On the Origin of Species"" by Charles Darwin. That is, if you care about the truth. This book is full of lies. What it preaches is blatantly wrong and you would be a fool to believe a word of it."
1,The inability to think equates to the inability to vote !,"This (comic) book tells us much more about the mentality of it's authors and readers then it does about evolution. And more importantly it helps to explain how the Repiblicans could convince a majority of voters to vote for an intellectual midget like G.W. Bush.It is now clear that an American conservative is one who believes that there is proof that Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction, but that evolution is an unproven fallacy!God (or Darwin) help the United States of America!"
3,No book required,"No book will change a democrat to a republican, no book will change a Christian to a Muslim. That's not how humans work, regardless of evolution or creation.Why write this book, unless your only goal is to make the people who already agree with you feel better. Why not put your energies to something interesting and useful, that brings people together instead of further seperation and distrust.But that's America today"
1,can't believe,I can't believe that so many people gave this piece of garabge high marks. This book and any thing else ever written Ken Ham is an absolute waste of a tree.
1,Refuting nothing,"Sarafati's book begins promisingly, but soon degenerates into blatant and unashamed creationist propoganda. He presents a few problems regarding evolution that are worth ruminating over, but for the most part he merely contradicts himself and asserts, without evidence, that his view of the creation of the world fits sceintific evidence better than evolution does. The reader does not have to read far until Sarafati sheds any illusion of scientific fairness or reason. Good for an ardent creationist who would like a source to quote in argument, bad for anyone looking for any real scientific insight."
5,Scientific Foundation for Faith,"If you want data and science to help enlighten technical-minded friends and family about the Truth, this book will help. It still takes Faith though, but no more Faith than arguing that evolution has occurred, as humanists proclaim. There is no absolute physical Proof either way: either you have Faith that Creationism is the answer, or that Evolution is the answer..."
2,Fallaceous Method,"A central methodological thinking error of Sarfati's book, typical of the creationist genre, is the mistaken belief that large, intricately complex structures necessarily imply a creator. Rather than speculate about distant subjects such as ancient species origin, let's look at something clearly knowable and only 2,000 years old. My Ph.D. is in linguistics and I have taught or directly supervised instruction in over two dozen languages. Each language is an extremely, elaborately complex, multi-systemic structure. Two thousand years ago, Spanish, French, Italian, Portuguese, etc., didn't exist. They exist today, each as a highly complex structure, but none was created, nor was its direction of development directed by anyone. Each simply evolved from spoken Latin; the evolution of each is known and documented. It is manifestly unnecessary to postulate the existence of a creator to account for multi-layered, highly organized structures."
5,Life sprang from nothing- right genius!,"One strand of DNA holds as much info a set of 26 book encyclopedias. And not random info either. Change one sentence and the whole thing falls apart. Yet idiotic evolutionists believe DNA magically came into existance by random chance and then went through billions of positive mutations to advance to all the different stages and types of life today.One genetetist said that's about as likely as a tornado going through a junk yard and producing a fully assembled and functioning 747 aircraft.Sorry, I don't have enough faith to believe in evolution; I'm only a Christian."
5,I love it!,My wife bought me this drill in 2002 for Christmas and I don't think I will ever need another one. It's the perfect size and weight for almost any job and has more than enough power to keep up with tough repetitive tasks without overheating.
2,The monsters look blocky and not scary.,I bought this game because I wanted to shoot monsters and I wanted to be scare. What a disappointment! The monsters look blocky and not scary. It's a bloody game. There's a lot of killing. It's tiresome after 20 minutes of killing people and monsters without any suspense.
1,STARFORCE !!!,"This game uses STARFORCE.The Suffering is one of my favorite games.This one goes to charity.-----Do a Google search of Starforce.There is a site with a forum and a thread which contains this game.Several had problems; a few had big problems.I believe there is a patch ?I stopped reading, as I already gave the game to charity.Just wanted to update my review for those interested in the game or having problems."
5,Great Voice - Great Pop Song,"This is simple a beautiful popsong sung by one of the most beautiful voices in modern pop-rock. Nash, best known as the singer of Sixpence None the Richer, is here into a more mainstream pop-style than she's usually known for. But as long as the material is as great as in this case, it doesn't really matter."
1,la riviere de notre enfance by michel garou,cd is on a paper sleeve not a regular cd box.only 3 songs for such a high price over 30$not worth the price
5,Great Merchant,I purchased this as a gift and my wife loves the fragrance. Dealing with this seller is a pleasure and I will most certainly do so again.
5,lovely,I only wear Annick Goutal and this is one of my favorites. Citrusy and not over-powering it is a lovely clean summer scent.
4,Beautiful music,"This is a wonderful CD! The traditional hymns are accompanied by a variety of instruments - fiddle, Irish flute, uilleann, harp, etc. These instruments enhanced the hymns and made the message more personal and real for me. After listening to the CD, I felt like I had been in Ireland! Refreshing and inspiring music!"
5,Fantabulous! Super duper!,"Oh the JOY of reading Doctor Dolittle books! This is a great one. How can it be no publisher(s) have reprinted all the books including the zoo, the moon, the garden, the post office, puddleby adventures etc.?? Are they mad? These books are timeless stories that appeal to animal lovers everywhere!"
1,A Memory,"There isn't much to add to the other comments except this: I attended the premiere of this little opus in Southern California back in the late '70s. Many of the stars, including Mae West, were in attendance. Afterward, making my way through the stunned crowd, I came face to face with Dom DeLuise. I will never forget the look that passed between us."
1,only to see and enjoy the great Mae West,"well, what can i say about this movie, i just acquire it to see the great West on her 80s fun as ever in her last movie work. the dvd transfer? well i cant see any diference between it and the vhs format they have the same bad and poor image, but who cares is Mae West on it thats worth this dvd. for the Mae West fans is a great acquisition. well, she can even move, her voice is litle,but hello she was 85, and stills.... mmmm well come up and see me sometime."
2,She's Done Herself Wrong,"Mae West was seriously considered for the role of Norma Desmond in Sunset Boulevard. After watching this film, it's easier to understand why she was Billy Wilder's first choice.This film has to be the first commercial venture of a star losing all touch with reality. Mae doesn't do anything she hasn't done before, and she does it as she always did, but she's living in a world where time and space no longer exist.She's in her eighties. She wears false fingernails and a gaudy array of wigs. Her waistline is non-existent. Her face is sagging and her voice is cracking. She exhibits all the usual attributes of a senior citizen. But the producer, the director, and her co-stars have apparently decided to give the old lady one last charitable send off, and she must have gone to her grave happy. But any discerning viewer has to see it as documented evidence of a great star who's lost all touch with reality and could be considered clinically insane."
2,Painful to watch...,"If you're a big fan of Mae West,I suggest you get her movies when she was in her prime,but not when she was in her 80's and still acting like she was back then.Why would a 30 something year old man like Timothy Dalton be attracted to an 80 year old woman in the first place?? An 80 year old woman arousing a young man?? Yeah,right..If you like camp or bad movies,then this right up your alley.This is bad all the way around.Bad comedies and bad musicals don't go together for one thing.Maybe separately,but not this.Do you really want to see Mae and Timothy sing ""Love Will Keep Us Together""?? Not me.Everyone involved ought to be ashamed.From Alice Cooper to Regis Philbin to Tony Curtis to the director and the writer.No wonder this movie bombed.It belongs right along side ""Can't Stop the Music"".See Mae West when she could pull off the sexual innuendos back in her prime,but this?This is plain embarrassing and painful..YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!!!"
3,"a lot of ""tette"" and no ""sex""","ONLY for Mae West 'FANS' -- mostly unfunnnnny - even supporting players - buy if you just want ""all"" the great lady's movies. I love her even at her worsttes."
5,SEXTETTE: Don't Let This Happen To You!,"That Greta Garbo retired from films in her mid thirties did more to keep her memory and ""the mystique"" alive than anything else she could have done. That Mae West decided to film ""Sextette"" in the late Seventies, when she was in her mid eighties, is the flip side of Garbo: the Baby-Jane-Norma-Desmond syndrome descended upon a new world with new values. And to pair West with the young Timothy Dalton and expect the audience to take the romance seriously further complicates this already messy film. Part musical, part comedy, part Grand Guignol, this film should be seen for the five-star lesson it presents: know when to gracefully retire, leaving only the fondest of memories, Garbo-like, captured on film forever."
4,Camp-Fest ala Mae,"I'm amazed this many other people have seen this movie! I loved it! Mae in glorious technicolor reviving Diamond Lil is fantastic! The entire movie is hilarious, probably not in the way that Mae intended, but I'm sure she's happy to get a laugh. And the fact she did this at 85 is astounding. This is also the only movie you see her drink alcohol in."
3,La Sonnambula aka Mae West,"Mae West in all her glory at an advanced age (she passed away a year later). She tries to capture her magnetism with the one-liners, double-entendres and several tons of makeup and wig. She seems to sleepwalk through the entire movie and is obviously much too old to be playing the femme fatale to these considerably younger men. A poor script and mediocre performances. The movie begins to become boring listening the same cliches and the zombie-like movements she displays. However, for Mae West fans who would like to see her try to recapture her glory in this final hurrah, I recommend a look at it for the unique style that West possessed even well passed her heyday. I give it an A for effort."
3,"A Movie So Bad, It's Actually Good!","I've seen Sextette a couple of times. The first time I saw it, my jaw dropped at the absurdity of pairing Mae West with love interest Timothy Dalton. Then there were the assorted cameos of everyone from George Raft to Alice Cooper. Mae West was probably the only star out there who had the moxie to assemble such a diverse group of characters into the same picture. The second time I watched it, I took the movie for what it was -- a fun, campy pic that doesn't take itself seriously in the least. Kudos to Ms. Mae!"
2,this movie is available on iTunes!!!,it's less than 20 bucks....so don't go spending anymore than that in this wonderful economy we have!!Cheers..Tony(NYC)
3,So Bad It's Good,"If you are looking for a proper introduction to Mae West the legend, go rent She Done Him Wrong. If you are an unrepentant fan of 70s camp, this is your Christmas morning. Nowhere else on this planet are you going to find Keith Moon, Ringo Starr, Alice Cooper (in a perm that defies description), Dom Deluise, and Regis Philbin together in one place until the afterlife. Sextette, IIRC, is based upon one of West's plays and is basically a compendium of some of her best one-liners stitched into a wafer-thin plot involving a comedy of errors. One wedding night, five interfering ex-husbands, and disintegrating peace talks happening in the same hotel...just like in real life.The music will make you cringe, and if you were born after 1990 you aren't going to recognize anybody. As a curiosity in cult cinema, however, I think it's worth the 2.99 rental - Keith Moon's turn alone is worth the price of admission."
3,Eh...,"The strecthy sleeves are nice, but the top button always comes undone from normal use and movement. Annoying enough to look for a different brand."
5,Petzold as always,"Whenever you hear the name Petzold, the only thing to examine is if the subject is for you. This is for beginner programmers who want to start in C# and not ONLY for beginners in C# but otherwise experienced in other environments. All negative reviwers here state that simple fact!So if you are a beginner in programming who wants to start in C# this is the absolutely FIRST book you must own. PERIOD.Also, dont think that the material is outdated, since it covers the basics."
2,WARNING! For beginners only!,"If I were a beginning programmer, I would give this book 4.5 stars. I gave this book a poor rating because it does not clearly state its intended audience, which are beginning programmers. It is NOT intended for those who already are proficient at another language (C,C++,Java, etc.) to learn how to program in C# and .NET. It was too basic and didn't teach me enough about C# syntax nor how to use the Visual Studio .NET environment (it included it's own compiler).The title should have read ""Learn to Write Your First Programs, a C# Experience!"", or something of that nature."
4,Fantastic work out,you most likely are planning on getting this already since you must be a pretty avid cyclist to know about these. The build quality is fantastic. Its got to be the best bang for the buck for roller trainers. I love mines. My only gripe is that there isnt any resistance adjuster but those that come with that are much more expensive. Take your time getting on this thing and it will reward you with a nice full body work out. you'll notice that you get tired faster than you would be on a stationary trainer.
3,Currently not functional,"Overall a near solidly made product, but the unit I received appears to have been opened atleast once in it's lifetime. Currently leaning against the wall as a black retainer cap for one of the 'U' swing pin is missing (hence my thoughts about this package being opened and possibly used at least once may be a valid concern) and yes... I checked the package VERY thoroughly.Contacting Amazon LLC for either replacement part, or return for a new one.Let me make it very clear, the product is good (once the missing part is in place), its just Amazon who is less than stellar on this purchase. I'll toss in another star once it is on the ground and being used instead of folded up and collecting dust."
5,The Writer of Writers,"Wilbur Smith is the kind of writer that makes every other writer want to break their own fingers and take up goat herding. He's that good and Men of Men clearly demonstrates that talent with its unique storyline, remarkable history, and great adventure.Does he measure up to every reader? Probably not because he tells epic adventures with hardships, battles, love, sex and violence that's not for everyone's palate. But with millions of books sold and a fan base that spans the world a few times around, he apparently reaches a lot of readers who keep coming back for yet one more adventure...readers like me."
2,Not his best.....still a big fan....still read it.,"I have read a dozen of wilbur smiths novels and will continue to the read the ballyntine saga, although I was very disappointed in this one. It was slow, too detailed, harder to follow and didn't live up to any of the courtney novels, the egyptian novels or the previous ballyntine novel....However, you still have to read this book, the entire saga is awesome, the characters grow on you and he brings the land alive....."
2,A struggle to get through...,"I read Birds of Prey -- my first book by this author and loved every minute of it. Consequently, I was very happy to find Men of Men in the library. Unfortunately, my happiness was short-lived. I found it a struggle to get through most of this book, so I finally quit at just over half way through it. I found it rather boring. I gave it two stars because every now and then something would happen that I found interesting, but for the most part, the book was not what I expected. However, because of how much I liked Birds of Prey, I haven't given up on the author yet. I'll try something else. This book just didn't do it for me."
4,Ho that's why Southern Africa is so screwed up!,"Another good ""Historical"" Novel by Wilbur Smith. The more of his books I read the more I understand why Africa is so screwed up. Good action and Smith does his usual great job of getting you involved with each of the characters."
2,Men of Men,I have read at least15 Wilbur Smith novels and have generally enjoyed them. I thought this was the poorest one I have read and would not recommend it.
3,Interesting read,"This book was not quite as engrossing as its predecessor, A Falcon Flies, but it obviously is quality writing, and as always with Wilbur Smith, you feel strongly drawn into the story.As a new twist on the Ballantyne series, you see more of the next generation in Men of Men, and it offers interesting conflicts throughout the book that keep the reader on edge and allow for multiple viewpoints on the same events.In order to understand this book better, you will have had to read the aforementioned book, but given the level of depth that Smith always goes to in his books, it does not feel like incredible amounts of reading.Smith writes the most exciting, enthralling books I have ever read, and I could not imagine another writer who draws readers into his books so easily that it makes them feel as if they are watching the story in front of their eyes as they read. Absolutely incredible writer, Smith is, and I would recommend this, along with every other of his books."
4,Men of Men(Ballantyne Novel),"Since I have not read the books in the series in order, it provided me with the additional background to the family history. I have learned so much regarding the wars, natural resources, and scenic beauty of Africa through Smith's descriptive writing."
3,The Switch,I found the switch from present day to distant past difficult to follow at times. It almost seemed that the an important part of the story was left untold particularly at the end. The abrupt ending in the final chapter left me with a feeling that the author either didn't know how to end it or just wanted to get it over with. Abandonment comes to mind. Not one of Wilbur Smith's better efforts and I've read all of his work.
3,USED MEN OF MEN PURCHASE,BOOK WAS IN ACCEPTABLE SHAPE. COVER O.K. PAGES O.K. BUT QUITE MUSTY SMELLING. IT HAD TO BE IN A BASEMENT FOR QUITE ALONG TIME. I BOUGHT THIS USED SO I AM O.K. WITH PURCHASE. I GOT IT FAST.
4,Frequency badly treated,"I hate it when a movie blows my socks off to the point where I'm the first guy in line when it's out in stores, but dosen't do well in theatres. Dennis Quaid makes an amazing return to the silver screen in a beautiful movie all about time travel. One of my favourite subjects. The intensity between father and son when it's discoverd they can talk through time is simply awe inspiring. I had not known who James Caviezel was before veiwing the film and immediatly did a background check, the man is gifted and I hope Hollywood gives him his due. If you like movies that show you the same place and two different times then this is the right film for you."
4,good but sometimes maudlin,"I've always loved this movie for the action, the well-written science fiction, and the father-son love, but the last time I watched it I became aware of way too much slow-moving emotional crap that detracts from the overall impact of an otherwise excellent film."
3,A decent movie that gets derailed halfway through...,"The movie starts off with a promising sci-fi premise, and is strenghtened by a heartfealt story. The acting was simply great by all involved. However, halfway through the movie it changes into a predictable ""fugitive"" type of action/suspense flick. This is anotheter case of a half written script with another hour of filler added by some hollywood formula writer. Also, the ending simply does not add up at all, if you really think about it. All in all, it was an OK movie to watch if you have the time to kill."
3,nostalgic -suspensful,"Watching this movie sparked a part of me from my youthful days, a slower time of growing-up and enjoying my family and friends. Father worship, bigger than life, mister invincible all rolled in one. And than there's the Sci-Fi involvement of what if... and that intrigues me very much especially when it is done very well. My background is graphic design/ computer art and I'm usually looking at how the special effects were done. Portions of the movie used great graphics and some used not so great, but you get passed it by the story line (simple). All in all Frequency was entertaining and that is why I liked it. Yes, I would see it again."
3,touching,"A sci-fi story for the heart. Most impressive plot where everything falls right in place, no script mistakes, no unnecessary drama. Dennis Every Given Sunday Quaid so human and fun. A perfect film for the whole family."
5,Awesome from begining to end,Caviezel and Quaid are simply awesome. The movie keeps you in suspense and the end is the best. This movie is a must see for anyone and everyone. (Especially if Caviezel is your favorite actor...sigh*) But seriously no Bias. If you dont see it youre missing out.
4,Refreshingly different,"This was a video that held many pleasant surprises. What a great original piece of writing.Most movies can be figured out before the ending, this one held my interest and kept me guessing. The ending was magnificent. This movie could also apply to living a full and happy life today."
3,Father and son.,Frequency starring Dennis Quaid and James Caviezel is a sweet film of a father and son who have been separated but may get a chance to reunite through the help of a two-way radio. The film is kind of soapy in parts but I a lot of reviewers seem to enjoy this tender film. Check it out sometime!
4,This one grabs you,I'll keep this review short. Overlook the few loopholes that are in the plot. I'm not going to point them out because that's petty. This is a very suspenseful movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat throughout. It might also raise a lump or two in your throat. Lost opportunities and second chances is what this story is all about. And it does do a very good job handling the many pitfalls that can arise in a time travel story. It's well worth ones time to watch this movie. It's good to see a science fiction story that keeps it's sense of humanity. The special effects and hardware are not only secondary they're almost non-exsistent. Great movie.
5,"A great movie, kind of unexpected","Frequency is a very good movie. It's entertaining and suspenseful the entire way through. The actings great and the story's even better.I'll admit that the beginning of the film starts off kind of slow. They really try to develope the characters in a great way. There are a few moments were I wonder why it wasn't edited better. After the first 40 minutes the movie really picks up and it doesn't stop until the end.Quaid gives the performance of his career. Caviezel puts on an excellent show in his role. Andre Braugher gives an outstanding performance also. There were a few weak performances, but not many.It's a great story. One that really draws you in each second you watch. Definitely worth a rent or buy."
3,the time travel by roller coaster,"Enjoy ""Frequency"" as it is! You may be confused seeing at the frequent hapnnings across time, which were changed by Little Chief, John. He did it for the sake of saving his parents' lives. Wouldn't be fantastic to share time and feeling with loved one? John could do it. As the result, his whole life was completely different from his previous life. So, what does this mean to him? Where has his former life gone? ...Don't worry! This movie is more meaningful than a such reasonable question. ""Frequency"" is a thrilling, touching, and persuadable family movie. You might want to play baseball with your son."
5,Brilliant thriller - one of Quaid's best,"I've been a fan of Dennis Quaid through some good movies and some not-so-good movies, but here is a role just perfect for him, as a 1969 NY fire fighter. Jim Caviezel is great as his cynical, 36-year old son in the parallel 1999 storyline. The time bridge is well done [willing suspension of disbelief required, but easy here] and the palpable link between father and son -- the son's loss at his father's early death -- is heartbreaking but ultimately life-affirming. Buy it, rent it, borrow it -- but see it. You'll be on the edge of your seat, but the payoff at the end is worth it."
2,An Unusual Twist on Cinematic Time Travel That Doesn't Seem to Understand Itself,"An odd twist on time distortion in which, due to the inexplicable appearance of the aurora borealis over Queens, a New York cop is able to communicate via ham radio with his long-dead father thirty years in the past. Completely ignoring the warnings of Doc Brown and Marty McFly, he immediately spoils the upcoming World Series and dozens of important life moments for his father, before the two decide to pair up in search of an unresolved string of historical murders. The film can't decide if it wants to do the sappy paternal bonding thing or follow a more suspenseful path, and its main plot mechanism is clunky, under-explained and inconsistent. It's also routinely telegraphed from beginning to end, with a narrow scope limiting its potential escape routes and an overdose of father-son baseball allegories. Hackneyed, hammy and haphazard, it plays like a bloated sci-fi short story in desperate need of revision."
3,Why Do I Like This Film?,"I was willing to make all sorts of leaps of faith in this time-travel, back-from-death movie because I was determined to like it!! (I like Dennis Quaid.)I was upsest by so much smoking. I don't like advertising in movies, and I especially do not like advertismeents of a product that killed both my sisters, beautiful women who died prematurely.I was, therefore, gratified to learn that our hero died of lung cancer. But I didn't figure out how he escaped the death from cancer, not even after watching the film twice."
2,This was worse for Dennis than Meg Ryan....,"I saw this movie when on vacation in Utah. I could not believe a talent like Dennis Quaid was wasted in a go-nowhere movie like this.I have seen Dennis Quaid in several films, and I have to say the only thing watchable about this film is his performance in it. His co-star is wooden, and unbelievable. The plot was not written well enough to hold my interest, even as an action movie.Go rent this before you spend the money on it."
2,"If you do not want to be confused, DO NOT see this.","At 16 maybe im too young to appreciate this type of movie but i realy didnt like it. When i first saw it at the movies i came out feeling very boared, confused and thought i was missing something. So when i had the oppotunity to see it again i thought i might understand it more. Nope i was just as confused and parts of this movie just do not fit together. From its advertising it sounded realy good, but its not what i thought it would be. I give it 2 stars for the good acting and the good parts here and there but thats all."
2,Plot holes galore and excessive sentimentality,"There are some interesting ideas in this film. It does try to be a father and son story, but somehow gets caught in the murky confusion of a temporal story gone awry. There are several plot holes, and no matter how seemingly compelling the father and son story gets, we can't ignore them.If you are like me and can't overlook cheesy, all too convenient solutions to problems, and plethoras of plot holes, you probably would be best off avoiding this one."
2,Good opener but I quickly lost interest,"whatever these reviewers are on, I want some. This movie dragged. I kept waiting for something cool to happen, but they just kept talking to eachother over the mic-bla bla bla blaaa. I wouldn't know if the conversation was good because I just fastforwarded all of it after a while. A real bore."
2,I have such a Tooth-Ache,"This movie had such a sugar sweet quality about it, I got a tooth-ache. I am surprised they didn't go back and save Political leaders and the like. Enjoyable most of the time if you can get past the obvious lack of rational thought, and wasted screen time. I should have rented it on video. Not a suitable movie to sit through at the theatre. TOO LONG. Rent it, make popcorn, take a break every 20-30 minutes, you're good to go."
1,Unsatisfactory,"I waited almost two months to rent this video. Unfortunately., I was disappointed. The movie while poignant, was spasmodic and disjointed. I had to try too hard to piece together the events while they were occurring. James Caviezel's performance was compelling. Dennis Quaid's acting was fair."
5,Kept me at the edge of my seat!,"I have to say that the plot to this movie is original. It makes you realize that one decision you make can change your life completely. I really liked the pace of it, and I felt involved watching it. Because of the nature of the plot, you cannot really predict what will happen next. Five stars!"
4,A Really Different Movie,"Now for those of you who think you've seen all the formulas that Hollywood has to offer, this is the movie for you.It's a cross between ""The Sixth Sense"" and ""Fields Of Dreams."" Starring Dennis Quaid as the deceased father from the sixties, and James Caviezel as his son in the present, who accidently start communicating via HAM radio during a freak Aurora Beorealis.It's a very intresting look at how just one changed historical event in a person's life can cause a ripple effect that can create havoc in that persons present day existence.Ladies, I highly recommend this film, it is a great father/son movie, for it's been known to make grown men cry."
5,Very Intense!,WoW! Great movie! Ok... its a tad hooky and it moves a little slow... (Just a little) but there are parts that keep you watching the whole way through that are just intense!!! Of course when the plot begins to unfold you are on the edge of your seat the rest of the way and the ending is unbelievable! I was just amazed at how wonderfully entertaining and clever the entire movie was. If you watch this movie STAY FOR THE END because this movie makes you feel great!
4,Very good,"I love time travel stories. In this one, nobody actually travels through time; rather, a father and son communicate with each other across the years. Doing so causes some unexpected and tragic changes in the past, which they are then honor-bound to set right if they can. I suspect that some mighty big plot holes would open up if I thought about this one too hard, but the basic concept is so appealing that I was willing to go with it. There is also a good, solid human relationship story at the core of this science-fiction thriller. A very entertaining film."
5,Frequency,"Frequency is a totally different story-line than the usual fair anda much overlooked fantastic movie. It certainly never received theattention it should have. It is a movie you'll never forget anddefinately want to own. If it seems slow at the beginning, staywith it -- it gets really dramatic and when you figure out what isgoing on, you'll be intriqued. Great Movie!"
4,My kind of movie,"""Frequency"" is my kind of movie. I like the whole communication into the past thing. It reminds me of ""Back to the Future."" I just saw it and it is very entertaining. Trust me, if you see it, you will want to see the whole thing."
2,FRequency,"Very strange to follow. Too much forward and backwards in the plot. Like the suspense, probably won't watch again.Too shifty."
3,Really wierd... spaced out movie..,"If you collect blaxploitation movies.... This is a must have. Very different, unique movie. If you were born or raised in the 70's... You'll love it.. I especially like the scene where Sun Ra appears in a youth recreation center because the teenagers reminded me of my years growing up."
3,The Great Letdown,"The film is mysterious and colorful and I think thats its biggest strength. But you don't get a good handle on Sun Ra's own space philosophy other than ""black people must free themselves"". Overlong with good performances, but not enough musical performances. It finishes with the classic 70s ambiguous ending. In truth, not a very good music film or blaxploitation film or weirdo-art film. It has genius moments you would find in all three, but only remains infamous due to it being a weird mix of the great ingrediants."
3,????????????????????????????????????????????????????????,"This may not be the ideal starting place to enter the heliocentric worlds of the late Sun Ra, but, if you've checked him out AND seen him perform, well, you might be more likely to ""get"" this. Not that it's some art-house film. It's just way-out-weird. Like Sid-&-Marty-Kroft meets Parliament/Funkadelic... Underneath all the great-but-misunderstood space talk is a keen look at race in America. But, don't let THAT heavy statement put you off; being enlightened by this is like learning from SCHOOLHOUSE ROCK, it's valid, but, it's FUN and delightful and wacky... Then again, maybe I'm just a sucka for '70's cheese... Who knows? Loving this for me was all the more easy for having encountered several Arkestra members in full regalia, shopping at the local supermarket while they were in town. They're the real deal.."
3,pretty good,this film is pretty nice but not nearly as great as the documentary A Joyful Noise. I highly recommend purchasing A Joyful Noise first because it provides a deeper look into Sun Ra.
3,"Does not respect the truth of the time,","Sorry, but this varies from the truth of the time greatly in regards to the community and behavior of the community, painfully so. It is a fairly good whimsical tale, but the gross false painting of the time is actually insulting to the reality of what happened, and why-- and how things were done. ONLY if you view it as total fiction from an alternate universe is it acceptable; and that's a shame."
3,Interesting,"I bought this for my 13 year old son who is a book worm. It was a surprise buy. He finished reading it in 2 nights. This book is part of a series but even though he enjoyed it, he didn't ask me to get the next book. He always finishes series books but I was a bit disappointed that he didn't want the other books by this author. I thought it was interesting, but apparently it didn't appeal to him as much. It was a good book but it didn't capture his interests as much."
5,The reason I read Scifi,"When sorting my search results for science fiction books with telepathy as a subject, I was not a bit surprised to see Catspaw come up as readers' number 1 selection. I have a bookself with my all-time favorite scifi books, the ones I would lend to someone who hadn't read much scifi, and this book is the first I would pull out. It has a sympathetic character, great world-building, and a fabulous premis that starts you wondering about the future and possibilities beyond the everyday experience."
5,"One of my favorite books, ever","I have been trying to figure out why I love this book so much. It obviously has to do with the main character, Cat, who is at times the quintessential underdog, then the hero of the universe (for at least fifteen minutes). Ms. Vinge creates characters (major and minor) that you not only want to know, but you want to become in some higher sense. The action, intrigue and adventure in Catspaw are also incomparible.I also highly recommend the prequel and sequel to Catspaw - Psion and Dreamfall, respectively. They are both wonderful books, but Catspaw remains my favorite."
5,Coal Miner's Daughter - Great Reading For All Ages,"The movie is good but the book is excellent. Perhaps the best autobiography ever written. The chapters flow with stories of sadness and humor expressed in Loretta's one phasing. For someone without much of an education, the wisdom and values Loretta shares within the book is inspiring. You will be left wanting to read more about this wonderful lady. This book does not disappoint."
1,Couldn't read it,Pics are nifty. Watch Coal Miner's Daughter. Don't try to read this book. I know she was raised in the woods but trying to read like you are illiterate is kinda challenging.
2,The Soviet view of the Cold War,"Tass is Authorized to Announce is the Soviet version of any spy thriller you have ever read (or seen on the big screen) - but with the KGB as the good guys, attempting to foil the sinster plots of the CIA. However, Semenov lacks the semantics of say, a Tom Clancy. The plot is razor thin, the anti-semitism is revolting, and the the resolution of the conflict is laughable.While the book is certainly dated, (Cold War intrigue in Africa is so passe), it is an entertaining read if only to see how the USSR understood detente and cold war politics. Other than that, the book is tripe - not recommended."
3,not bad,"bought it to find my poem that was published but to no avail, it was not in this book. on to the next..."
5,Great condition,This book was in excellent condition when received. Some of the poems are interesting. Many provoke thought - leaving you wondering what mind set was the writer in when they wrote the poems.
4,Inflated Price,This is a nice watch but beware which listing here you purchase from since the price direct from from Fossil is only $105.00.
1,please look for a better source than SRW,"Those of us in the pagan/wiccan community rarely take Silver RavenWolf's writings as serious in nature, as her writings are filled with condescending tone, advice to lie for teens, and an obvious gimmick to make money without any regard for gaining credibility for the pagan community. If you are looking for credible resources, look to Scott Cunningham, Raymond Buckland, Christopher Penczak, Ellen Dugan, but if you see Silver RavenWolf RUN the other way."
4,A good encyclopedia,"Silver has kept targeting the young audience since her first books. However that does not mean the information is childish or in any way bad. In fact in this huge book which becomes biggeer with her smaller print she has packed in TONS of information. If you can look past the silly teen anecdotes and mama silver type stuff you'll find a book filled with valuble info. I own this book and while I wouldn't say it's a must have, it's definitely taught me a lot that's missing from other 101 books"
2,So-So,"I honestly believe that paganism, religion whatever you want to call it is about bettering yourself. Not begging to diety to give you everything you want. Silver claims to belive the same thing but then provides spells for love and money. How many books does she need to publish on the same information. It seems to me that she is just trying to get her 15 minutes of fame, and make a bunch of money. There is nothing new in this book that makes it a 'must read'. If you want an introduction Paganism: An Introduction to Earth-Centered Religions by Joyce and River Higginbotham is much better."
2,Nicely-Compiled.,"I have an eclectic taste in my reading material and I was hoping this book would present a neat atmospheric tableau upon which the author spun her ""facts"" about this topic, but I didn't find much that was impressive, cool, informative, or even suitably moody about Solitary Witch. In short, I'm sorry to say it was a bit of a letdown. EXCEPT man that cover is wild! Might I make the suggestion that better packaging would help a future edition? By that I mean dress up the interior with art and design that matches the grand cover. That would really spark this tome up."
1,Ultimate? . . . Fluff!,"I bought this because it seemed to cover a lot of territory. In the end, that's its biggest fault--kind of a lick and a promise approach. Even worse is that this author seems to devote much of her efforts to feeding the usual teenaged angst, and giving youngsters the idea SHE is the only one who understands them. . . very dangerous territory, IMO. One thing to offer generic advice, and another to try to generate a cult following. Some useful stuff within, but even more to have to sift through with a grain of salt. If you're new to this topic, don't make the mistake of ending your search here."
1,Pass the blender please!,"If you're looking for a re-hashed conglomerate of all the books on the craft out there, then go ahead and buy this book. Here, Silver has successfully minced up her old works, thrown in some bogus information to taste, and hit the puree button on the proverbial blender.Personally, I wouldn't bother with the investment. I borrowed the book from a friend, and returned it disgusted, not wanting to buy it for myself. In this book, there are places where Silver begins to Christanize some of the Pagan ideas... in my opinion, she's just selling out her craft.If you're looking to get started in the craft, I would absoluely recommend some of her earlier books, like ""To Ride a Silver Broomstick"" and ""To Stir a Magick Cauldron."" These books are excellent, and essential additions to the library of any serious Witch. This new book, however, is defiently one that my bookshelf will be happier without!"
3,Not a bad book,"Solitary Witch: The Ultimate Book of Shadows Not a bad book over all some of ideas are nice and fun way of looking at things, However some of parts in book on magickal timing are a royal pain for a teen and even for a newbies to the craft I been practicing the craft for 10 years and looking for books to teacher my students. I have quite of few books in my courses but this book is cute and can help teens but not everone is a teen either if she wanted acne spell then she needed to put teen witch book.I do agree with her on some points using creativity in rites is a great idea but some of stuff seems to complex for some (hint) Some of most powerful,effective rites come from within. like all books they are opinions take them at face value and use what works for you.Blessed Be;"
1,Not a Fan,"I have tried to read the ""whole"" of the book, but find that the book has too many ""holes"".For those who are interested in the Wiccan path, read Scott Cunningham as a start as he, and there are others, who explain and teach with great wisdom.I am sorry I am not s fan of hers, but I find her books more for teenagers and certainly they should not be reading Silverwolf without having read a proper authority on Wicca. Sadly, hers are the books that remind me too much of Halloween and all the kiddy behavior that sometimes follows.Please, save your money."
5,Yeah Silver! Now We're Talkin',"Hello everyone,If any of you ever want a great book (no matter of length) on Wicca this is the one for you. Yes its lengthy but you can do it. The best book for everything Wicca, it has eveything (short of wands, athames, etc). Even a section on herbs. Lots of Mythology too! Can't stress how great of a book this is enough. Love you Silver. Blessed Be"
5,Great Book,I highly recamend this to anyone interested in the field of wicca or witchcraft! Excellent book. Very good condition.
1,Was She Guessing???,"Has she stopped researching for these books? I have never returned a book in my life but this one went back to the store. Being Asatru I immediately opened up to the section on runes. That was a joke, they were completely messed up. She changed the names, swapped meanings for the runes, and even included the blank one. Runes are not something that one can debate on, they are what they are. The section of teenie bopper spells was memorable. Of course that kind of throws the three fold rule out the window. Or drives the witch performing them into a pickle, I would not want that backlash. This book was a waste of perfectly good paper."
3,"Long winded, overly dramatic...","This book is a decent encyclopedia. Meaning you go do your own thing, then, reference this book, then go back to your own thing. Ravenwolf is very motherly, to the point of being smothering. If you're really into being spoonfed, and long winded, winding incantations, speeches to the Gods, the same point being beaten into you, then this book is for you. Like you'll probably give it 5 stars. And there's nothing wrong with that.But, for me, it's a bit much. Too much drama. I'd rather not have a 2 page lecture on why you should not steal a cupcake and how this related to karma and peer pressure, (pg 532). Save it for the kiddie books. I prefer Scott Cunningham's writing style, and relaxed take. (He actually writes like I'm an adult not a complete idiot?)However, I have used this book quite a bit as a reference tool. Old spells and chants, runes, divination. Yay.Skip the mommy witch crap, get the information, get out."
2,A mixed bag,"Bottom line: some people might find it helpful. There are good resources here and solid information on lunar cycles, history, etc. But some parts of the book are flat-out wrong. She claims that the Hand of Glory wasn't ""an actual hand""! Sorry, $ilver, but blood of bat and tongue of dog weren't just ""herbal codes"", they were quite real.The book is geared to teenagers, and while it isn't too condescending, a lot of people are going to find it unbelievably silly. If you can stand her horribly annoying diction and you're well-versed enough to know what is and isn't fact, buy it. Otherwise, see if you can scalp it to a neighborhood teenybopper."
5,Excellent book,If you are into Wiccan rituals or want to learn more on spells to help with health ailments or protection it is worth buying. I found a lot of useful information in it. I initally found this book at a national book retailer and decided to look on amazon.com just to see if amazon would have a lower price on it and my hunch was correct. I received it sooner than expected.
1,Filler material for Wicaa wannabes.,"If you have no plans on taking Wicca seriously, read it by all means, but if you're exploring this as a legitimate religious option, stay away from her at all costs."
4,Solitary Witch,"I bought this book a few years ago. It's always a range between love it and hate it when it comes to her work. For this one, I just like it. There is some information that I take and refer back to (elements, Witches' Pyramid, etc), but I know that there's more to my Path. I wouldn't say that she's ""Fluffy"" only because she puts witchcraft in terms so teenagers can understand it. There are things that I don't agree with, but all-in-all it's a good reference.)O("
4,Encyclopedia of Shadows,"RavenWolf's book is a great tool and I would recommend this for anyone who wants to know more about Wicca or Witchcraft. It is basically an encyclopedia and would best be used along with a few other books, like Scott Cunningham's Guide to Wicca. I use this book often when I need a reminder or want to try something new."
4,Not Bad,"Shipping was slow, and book is ok. Haven't gotten all the way through it yet but contains a lot of information about wicca. Has a slightly more religious feel to it than I prefer, but if you ignore it, great book for any beginner and referencing information."
5,Great Book,"Great book, received in great time. I haven't finished but I know that I will truely enjoy it."
5,An Encylopedia of Knowledge,"They aren't kidding; it really is the ultimate book of shadows. It covers just about ever topic in magic/Wicca imaginable. It's rather hefty, and it takes a while to read if you read it cover to cover. But, it's well worth it. I refer back to this book all the time. It was one of the best buys on the topic I've ever made. I highly recommend it!"
4,Cut Silver a Break,"You either like Silver or you don't. This is the fourth book by her that I have purchased and I am not disappointed. There are too many books on Wicca out there that are a bunch of fluff. Silver may have a distinct personality and views on things-but she is not perfect people. You may not like some of her views but give me a break! We all have our own opinions. My advice is to glean what you will from any book and discard what you don't feel is pertinent to your practice. Stop being so critical!She does her best to be educational and informative, but also provides the reader with options to spellcasting and finding your path in your own time. I challange the Silver critics out there to write something better if you think you can. Otherwise do us all a favor and zip it. Use your energy for something more useful."
2,Not recomended,I would not use this book or any by this author. She has a Dogmatic approach which lends itself to be a one way view.It has some valid material but for someone who is serious about Witchcraft don't bother unless you like to be subject to her moral dogmatic beat down. Start with Scott Cunningham and avoid her material.
2,book of shadows and sex?,"I was expecting much more after reading the hard copy of the same titles book lent to me by a friend. This book, however, isn't half as informative. It has a chapter about sex. Nothing magickal about it. Really informative about herbs and basic spells, but I wouldn't recommend this book to serious practicers."
3,It's not bad,"I found this book helpful in starting out. It is a little condescending, but then again, it is written for teens. If you skip past the spells part, it's pretty good, information wise. The spells are idiotic, I'll admit that, but i found the rest of it prety informative and helpful starting out in my wiccan studies.i would recommend it to someone starting out, but read books by other authors too! Don't get all of your information from one book and think you're done. You're only just beginning."
3,Excellent guide for budding Wiccans...,And that says it all. Would NOT recommend to those who walk traditional or hereditary paths unless you're looking for some background work on learning to cast a circle.
4,Lots of Info - Aimed at Kids,"I have very mixed feelings about this book. On one hand, its got a TON of information and is a wonderful reference book. However, its written specifically for teenagers. If it wasn't aimed towards teens, it would be THE BEST book on the market and the CLOSEST THING TO AN ALL-IN-ONE WICCA BOOK that exists.Personally, the kiddy theme is too distracting for me to use regularly (but its still a great reference book). If you are considering buying this, look through it at a bookstore to see if its right for you. Barnes n Noble carries it, and they will order it if they are out of stock and you ask."
5,Pro Silver!,"I was going to buy this book long, long ago but fell victim to the opinions of others before finally deciding to give it a go myself. Silver Ravenwolf's 'Solitary Witch: The Ultimate Book of Shadows For The New Generation' is everything a Witchcraft 101 book should be; an absolute must have for the aspiring Witch. Ravenwolf writes with the perfect combination of joy, humor, wisdom and fact, and this book is no exception. I thoroughly enjoyed every aspect of this book and already refer to it on a daily basis. Don't be put off by negative reviews. Silver's books are FUN (I can't stand a typically boring book) and hugely resourceful!"
3,Eh...,"When I saw this book, I said ""Hey, that's a big book."" That's the main reason it was worth the $... It was a bit better than most of her books. She still seems to be talking to teens, despite her saying it was for both beginners and the experienced. She also continues to make the same mistake of using the words witch and Wiccan interchangably. Still, she did her research on this one, so it isn't too bad."
5,Silver's Best Efforts Yet!,"I am always amazed with Silver's work, but this book absolutely blew me away. Silver has a rare talent of taking some extremely tough subjects and putting them in a way that anyone can understand. Although this particular book has a leaning toward teaching the teen witch, it is also an indepth study for us crones :-) After all of her books over the past 12 years or so, I can't imagine what she could possibly write next - but believe me, I'll be first in line for her next book!"
2,She is already millionaire....,"you don't have to give $ilver more money, if your searching a spritual aproach you must read Marian Green's - A Witch Alone , if you're searching a new modern positive attitude read lasara Firefox's Sexy witch."
5,Wonderful book!,I was so surprised with this purchase. Raven Wolf is an exceptional author and teacher. I was also thrilled with how quickly this book arrived and the condition it was in. Fully happy with this purchase!!
5,My go to book,When I need help for guidance this is one of my first go to books. I love the information that is in here and have been able to use some of the referances as a guide to start my spells. Also use the blessing water a lot with my spells. I love Silver as a writer and recomend her.
3,Solitary witch review,At first I was very interested in this book..But in the middle of it I set it aside and started another book..Sad I think since I'm a book lover..I havent been able to pick it back up since. I have many books on the wiccan path and own 4 B.O.S.(s)..It was informative but lost my interest quick...It does have some ideas I dont agree with but most info i liked.
1,Confused,"I purchased this book with the idea that it could be a good reference guide for a student I have been working with. I would have returned the book if I could have. Although it is focused toward the wandering teen, it's ideas are too scarce. The ideas within are not necessarily focused to any one religion, but a mix of all the different aspects that the author has put together as wicca. This is a choice that is made by the practicioner, and nowhere in this book does it stress this opinion.For those who would like some fun reading about what fantasy religion could be, this would be the book for you. For those who really need some insight into pagan or wiccan religion/spirituality should look elsewhere."
3,Good Reference / Silly Book,"This book is a huge collection of reference material. However, it confused me a great deal. On the back cover it warns that the book is serious magick, so if you are looking for curses and the likes then put it down. The thing is that upon opening it up, one finds those same curses that the back cover indicates are missing. It is worth the money for the reference material."
5,perfect,"This book was listed in good condition but not 1 single flaw on or in it. Amazing book in amazing shape. Thank you. Oh, and it arrived ahead of schedule."
1,Poor quality product,"The idea around this board game is a good one--to make it cooperative. The picture on the board itself is a colorful and fun graphic. However, the quality of the product is very poor. The game pieces are on such thin paper and so tiny it is difficult to pick them up. It is VERY over priced for the quality of the product. Should be more like $5. Peaceable Kingdoms game, Stone Soup, is $10 instead of $15 and the quality is superb."
5,A great game for families with young kids,"This game basically combines the games Memory (where you turn over tiles to make matches) with Clue. The production value is low, but the game play is good and the artwork and theme are fun. Makes me want to try other games by Family Pastimes."
2,Very disappointing,"We've had the game for almost a year and we've only played it when it arrived. Frankly, my 5 year old daughter and I didn't find it as much fun or as stimulating as expected based on the positive reviews. Main complaint is that the pieces are INCREDIBLY flimsy (has a home made feel) and one has to manage that aspect instead of fully focusing on the important things. My secondary complaint is that the game is barely more involved than the basic memory card games that cost much less and no where near as challenging as Zoombinis software, which we love. So, this game is not much fun, not well made, not very stimulating, yet it carries a relatively high price - avoid it!"
2,The Secret is.... THIS GAME STINKS!,"Bought this for my five yo who plays it in his class.The overall compostion of the game is so cheap. It is like it was made on a copy machine. The cards are paper thin, and will not last over time. After setting up the game, many of the cards were already bent.Next thing is that the directions are somewhat complicated. Maybe I'm impatient, but I just did not get it.There are so many other games that are truly educational and that are well made. I'm just not sure that this is one of them."
3,Not bad for the price.,"I thought this game would be better made; mostly consists of very small cardboard pieces. But it's OK for the low price. Played it several times on Christmas and is good that it is a cooperative game, especially for the younger kids who get easily discouraged with games that are competitive."
1,Poor quality without supporting service,"I totally agree with the other reviewers: the quality is very poor. damage the card in the beginning. very easy to lose small cards. very cheap made. does not worth $12. The idea is fun. But there are other better games at this price(I mean quality). BTW, there is no way to contact the seller or manufacturer. No phone number, no response. Do not buy this. Buy something made in U.S. At least you can talk to someone when there is a problem."
4,good cooperation game,i like that it teaches you to work together rather that against each other. it comes with a book with other games you can order too.
5,Fun for everyone,"My 10 year old son and I have played this game and found it alot of fun. Not only the game is fun, but it is fun to play a game where you work things out together. You either win together or lose together. It is a great game for anyone who has a problem playing games against another person or anyone who is a bad loser or a bad winner. It comes in a heavy duty box which is great for those of us who have spent half our lives taping game boxes back together."
4,Fun but not too Fun,"I have 4 kids, ages 7 1/2, 6, 4 1/2 and 2. We couldn't wait to get and play the game based on reviews we had seen. It is a matching and memory game which is fun but the pieces are very small and can be difficult for little fingers to handle and my older ones bored of it after two games, each of which lasted about 10 minutes. It's fun for a short attention span but not one we grab on a rainy afternoon."
3,Nice looking but has some issues,"I purchased this a few months ago from Amazon and just got around to installing it. I've installed many faucets in the past and this one was a little different. For one thing there is no gasket between the faucet base and sink. I thought this was kind of strange since all the others I installed had one. I just hope that the kids don't let a lot of water gather at the base since I'm sure it will leak down. Also, the cold water side makes a grinding/rubbing noise. I took it apart and everything looks OK, so I'm thinking there may be a problem with the cartridge. I'm going to call Moen and order another one.I've always had good luck with Moen's in the past and this one was a little disappointing. I guess this may be one of their lower end models?"
2,Bad Sample,"I downloaded sample to compare the translation of this edition, but the entire thing was the introduction. There wasn't even a hint of the first paragraph. The publisher ought to address this soon. I will not buy until i have an idea of this version's meter and flow."
5,If you're into this sort of thing...,"Then you'll love it. If not, then rent Bambi. For those idiots that STILL believe all those lame rumors (removing ribs to perfom felatio on himself) well then you shouldn't be watching this sort of video and should probably stick to wrestlin' anyway. It's a show...it's for shock value....GET IT?!?! Why do you think he does all the ""bad"" stuff (ripping bibles, giving oral sex to Twiggy on stage, self mutilating, etc ) he does? TO GET PEOPLE TO PAY ATTENTION! Wake up America....this isn't the wonderful place many of you seem to think it is....he's trying to point that out...trying to wake people up. Do some history on the guy before you rip him, he actually went to a CHRISTIAN school...yeah that's right......and there he learned how cruel this world can be. It's a great video depicting an over the top performer.....but as I said...if you're into this sort of thing then you'll love it!"
1,"Evil, Self-Mutilation, Vomiting, Defecation, Oral Sex, Abuse","Here's my review: In this video your children WILL SEE: Marilyn Manson rubbing a Bible on his naked crotch; Marilyn Manson mutilating himself by cutting his chest with broken beer bottles; A band member vomiting back stage; A band member forking a piece of excrement; Marilyn Manson performing oral sex on his (male) lead guitarist? They will hear a woman being abused. She was actually being abused or she was the best actress on the planet. They will see hate and agression, all in the creative guise of free speech - you couldn't call it entertainment. Oh yeah, there was some music in there too.It's America and he has the right to do so, to do so doesn't make it right."
3,Marilyn Manson is NOT a normal person,"Sometimes I wonder what goes through the mind of Marilyn Manson. What powers from the depths of hell created this band?! I swear I have never seen a nastier artist than Marilyn Manson. Not even Slayer was as nasty as this guy. Believe me, one look at the video ""Sweet Dreams(are made of this)"" scared the living hell out of me. I'd rather be watching videos from the Aphex Twin master ""Richard D. James"". If you plan to watch this video.......well, don't say I didn't warn you."
5,this video shows marily manson at their best.,This video shows Marilyn Manson at their best. The sound quality and video quality are excellent. Pick it up if you like Marilyn and after you have watched it...You'll like them even more. END
5,it rocked harder than manson himself,i liked this video because it showed his better songs.it rocks and if you don't believe me watch it for yourself.
5,SHOCK ROCK AT ITS BEST,"This film is a night on the barricade taken a step further. A bit short, but a must-see for all Manson fans."
1,Don't buy!,"Don't waste your money! The original book was far better than this version. So was the 70s version, one of those ""Made for TV"" movies.Find the book wherever you can, and read it. It is sort of like another favorite I read over and over again as a kid: ""My Side of the Mountain,"" by Jean George."
2,The Prince of Central Park,I watched this movie when the title caught my attention. As a young kid growing up in a highly disfunctional family I read a book with the same title. This was my favorite book through my entire youth as well as highschool. It was my escape.The movie is loosely based on the book in the charactors and the plot. However the book was so much deeper in the respect of how JJ learns to live in the park. As soon as the Kathleen Turner charactor is shown you know exactly where this thing is going. JJ never seems to be more than a few days at summer camp sleeping in a really cool cave.He never gets sick from eating out of garbage cans. He never breaks into Taven on the Green for food. He never build a tree house using ropes because he can't hurt the tree.This book is out of print but if you can find a copy or get it at your library READ IT! You will remeber it forever.
1,Prince of Centeral Park,"Many years ago, I saw was fortunate to see off Broadway show ""Prince of Central Park"" Reason I say fortunate, is because UNFORTUNATELY this was in and out. Everyone I was every telling about this show has never heard of it. I have to say that that was THE most impressive shows I have ever seen. Many years later I came across this movie and was excited because I could finally share it with my husband who I was telling so much about the show. Unfortunately the movie was not done as powerfully as the show was. Even thought the subject is very moving. I wish this Broadway Show would be back."
2,"Loved the style, but the content....not so much","To read the plot summary off the cover, you would have thought that this was a lovely poignant classic, along the lines of ""Little House"" or something. Just sounded so sweet. It wasn't. I got tired of the over the top, bizarre sexual scenarios, they were perverted and so unnecessary to the otherwise compelling story. It seemed so forced as if the author thought it vital to the selling of the book to throw in various gratuitous sex scenes. Nothing like the style of story you would think you were getting from the paragraph descriptions above on this book. I got half way through the book and gave up....wasted time. Very disappointed."
3,Fair and Tender review,"A good read for a day at thebeach. Not too much in this story that needs deep thinking, sort of popcorn for the brain."
5,How did I not discover Lee Smith a long time ago?,"Deft storytelling, timeless truths about women's lives, and an authentic voice that I can vouch for, having spent time with family in that part of the world. Ivy's story helps me to finally understand a lot about my own late mother, who grew up there and would have been only a few years younger than her. Like Smith, when I went to college and read Faulkner, I wondered what South he was talking about, since what I knew was Appalachian Virginia. Finally, this wonderful writer has captured the essence of that other, fascinating ""secret"" South, which has little to do with the Civil War and is more than just Hatfields and McCoys. I cannot heap enough praise on this book."
4,A Fairly Soft Piece of Work,"My youngest daughter - in college - seems very well pleased with this selection... like the professor gave her a choice, right?"
3,A book to be appreciated by women...,"Members of our Book Club were mixed over the review of this book (and we are all women). The format of the book was difficult for some - this includes the language as well as the letter format. It was annoying at times that Ivy's letters were not answered...some were never mailed, thus the book was a bit more like reading someone's diary. Some in our group related well to Ivy's life...mostly the loneliness she felt and a craving for something more. It reminds you of how things were when your grandmothers/great grandmothers were growing up."
5,Highly recommended,Demo releases are often for fans only and reveal blemishes that are later fixed by clever producers. I find the opposite here. The slick production on the studio releases removed a lot of the personality of this band. This CD includes what I consider to be the best versions of many Records songs and makes me wish I had seen them live early in their career.
1,Worthless,"Doesn't fit the average 10"" subwoofer. Edge of grills sits on surround, doesn't even reach subwoofer basket. Don't waste your money."
3,"Not bad, had to use other brackets....","They protected the speakers, but I didn't like the hardware that came with them. I ended up bending some pipe brackets I had left over and screwing them on to hold the grills in place. But they did protect the speakers."
4,blast from the past,"A cheery story of a group of girls in a morally uplifting boarding school. Tells of a girl who needs to stay home for her health, and learns good lessons on love & friendship."
2,Not impressed,"I bought this, but I have yet to watch the entire DVD. I had hoped that it would be an easy step-by-step, but that was not the case. I am not sure if I should have understood this before purchase, but the part I watched was very new age spirituality and very little actual forms. It did not hold my attention at all."
3,The Real Deal...,"I bought this DVD for my husband. He has taken a Tai Chi class or two in the past and really enjoyed it. He has enjoyed this DVD too. However, it's definitely for the Tai Chi enthusiast in that, it's a self-learn kind of lesson; the instructor does NOT walk you through each of the moves. Therefore, if you have a curiosity about Tai Chi and are looking for a Tai Chi lesson, this may not be the disc for you. If, on the other hand, you have been exposed to Tai Chi before and you really enjoy Tai Chi and want ""someone"" to do Tai Chi with / to lead you in Tai Chi (but not teach you per say), this is the DVD to have in your collection."
2,Not for beginners,"This CD would probably be okay for someone already familiar with Tai Chi, but it was useless to a beginner. If I followed his directions, I sometimes would not be able to see his example on the screen. Also, more verbal directions/reminders throughout would have been helpful. His garments flowed attractively as he went through the positions, but I thought they obscured the movements."
2,Overly basic,So basic I just felt like turning it off and going back to bed. None of the tranquility I expected with doing this. Sleep was better
4,Tai Chi dvd,My purchase arrived within days. Being new to Tai Chi I found this DVD helpful. Some parts were too advanced for me so I used that time to review.
4,Just another review,"I haven't had the time I'd like to work through this video. However, I have to say it's thorough approach appeals to me. I've already see benefits from the breathing exercises."
5,I agree - Amazing DVD - Amazing animation,"I agree with the other reviews that this is an amazing DVD, and want to mention that it has incredible animations of the Qi energy in the body, as well as easy to understand diagrams of the the brain, glands, and internal organs while the instructor explains how these internal exercises work.Also, many of the exercises are taught in three stages, beginner, intermediate, and advanced, and each stretch is held for three minutes, so I doubt many of us will work our way up to the advanced version of the three minute exercise very quickly.Its a DVD that you can really grow with!"
2,Video Quality is VERY POOR - i think they copied the copy of a copy of a copy...,"I like the video but it jumps ahead. For the 20 minute workout, i'm done in 15! The 60 minute program is more like 40.i think of all of the tutorials, i have seen only 1 all the way through and most, it just skips over them. It is horrible! I tried this but the video is such poor quality that it makes it difficult to feel it is doing any good."
3,Good DVD,"The index for the DVD is a little confusing; sometimes I just want to pop in a DVD and go. However, the lessons are vigorous and relaxing at the same time. I found it a little tough as a beginner, but but then maybe I just didn't find the right lessons :-)"
1,"More Like ""Royal Rape""","The so-called ""hero"" of this book is nothing more than a rapist. For goodness sake, the first time they get together, he throws her down, holds her down and rapes her, and yet this is somehow supposed to be seen as romantic.This book is sickening. It does not deserve to be called a romance novel."
5,great story,"I usually don't like heroes to be princes and royalties from some unknown kingdoms but Rolfe was a great one. I liked his story and his behaviour (or at least I could understand why he behaved the way he did). The same goes for Angeline - she was a strong woman who was able to stand for herself and still stay gentle and caring. The story was full of action and though Jennifer Blake used quite flowery language, I really enjoyed reading it. Very well-written and believable with a lot of interesting side characters (the royal guard). I definitely recommend this book, and also Surrender in Moonlight from Jennifer Blake. (but beware, the love scenes are pretty steamy :-)"
5,Great Romance,"This was the first romance novel I read, it got me interested in the genre. I loved the characters, they were more developed than other characters in subsequent books I read."
5,Great intro to the genre.,"I bought this book way back in 1986. I was 18 yrs. old and had just gotten over a case of the flu that was so bad I thought I was literally going to die. When I was finally well enough to leave the house, I bought this book at the supermarket to celebrate my coming back to life, so to speak. It was my very first hardcore (read: steamy and sexy) romance. Unlike so many others, it had an interesting plot and characters. RS was the perfect blend of good storytelling and steamy love scenes; it's an excellent introduction to the word of romance novels."
1,Not a great book!,This is absurd. I don't know how the other reviewers judged this book. It is based on [assault] of an innocent girl and coersion. I'm forced to give a 1 star because no stars is not an option. The author is way off base in this one. I stopped reading the book when the prince mistook Angeline for Claire and proceeded to [assault] her.
3,"Very interesting and revealing, yet quite profane","I've been a Mel Torme fan for years, and I was interested to hear his inside take on the entertainment industry. In that capacity the book didn't disappoint; Mr. Torme has a great way with words and much insight to convey. In reading his book I discovered that he is quite materialistic and shallow -- something I hadn't really suspected. He quotes his friends and associates verbatim, including a significant helping of colorful language. In fact, I finally had to give up on the book halfway through because I just couldn't stomach the sheer volume of profanity. I did laugh out loud (something I rarely do) when I found the one word Mel saw fit to censor. It's a four-letter word beginning with ""f,"" but it's not the one you think. After page upon page of language straight from the gutter, he substituted ""f***"" for ""fart."" Go figure."
4,An entertaining if inaccurate look behind the Carry On films,"Cor Blimey premiered on the ITV network on Monday 24 April, 2000. We were treated to something fantastic - Cor Blimey was, in a word, stunning. I was familiar with the story, in general, having seen the original play and read the script. I was also familiar with the uncanny portrayals of Sid, Babs and Kenny, courtesy of Geoffrey Hutchings, Adam Godley and Samantha Spiro. Despite all that, from the opening theme, typical Carry On stuff courtesy of Barrington Pheloung, to the closing shots of Babs and Kenny (more on that later) Cor Blimey is a charming, funny and warm look at the lives of the people who continue to make us laugh 30 years later."
4,I have the download version from D2D!,I think this compilation is better than MAT 2&3 on consoles on mat2 they left out Mortal Kombat 1 on console versions but the PC version have this game.
3,lots of fluff with a little meat,"I'm intriged by anyone who tells the truth these days,however painful.I didn't realize he stuttered so much though.He only says one cuss word,but he says it constantly.he was mildly funny,but he never seems to get really rolling.I'm not too impressed with this album,but I might buy his others if they are any better."
3,"Lewis Black is hilarious, but this CD is not his best.","I find Lewis Black quite hilarious and I enjoy his performances including ""Rules of Enragement"", "" Luther Burbank Performing Arts Center Blues CD"", and his various TV appearances. This particular CD, however, is just not up to snuff. I don't know if performing at Carnegie Hall had something to do with it, but he didn't seem like he was in his element."
4,Blackout laughing,"Lewis Black is one of, if not the best contemporary comedian. I wish he would have been famous sooner so we could have enjoyed his work earlier. I love his political ramblings, and find his material informative as well as funny.I hope he continues to entertain us for a long time.A. Zelko"
3,"Ok, but not as good as previous works","I own all of Lewis Black's CDs, and I found this one to be the least entertaining. The CD started off kind of slow, and the routine seemed to lack polish and delivery early on. As the show went on it got better, but in general it still wasn't as funny as his previous work. I'm typically roaring from start to finish while listening to Lewis Black, but on this CD I found myself bored and longing for the radio at times. With that said, it's still not a terrible CD. My expectations are high because I've loved his other CDs, and this fell short of my expectations. Comedy (like music) is a personal thing, but I think there are far better Lewis Black CDs out there."
3,Standard Lewis Black fare,"If you've listened to any of his previous records or heard him on the daily show, you'll have heard most of this before. This isn't saying that it isn't funny. It's just been rehashed a few too many times"
5,Why is he always so right?,"As always, Lewis Black never fails to deliver, and this album is no exception. I learn more about politics from him, than from any other source! (kidding.....but you have to admit, he gets to the core of the issues) This album was much better than his performance on Last Laugh 2007. Now....if only he was not such a hot head, he'd make a good president!! Enjoy!!"
3,the Lazarus Pit,I really was not into this book. It was the wrong author not the James Patterson the Mystery writer. My mistake.
1,Shallow and Poorly Thought Out,"The best thing about Morey's book is the Recommended Reading list at the end. Too bad he didn't study some of the books he listed. John Howard Yoder could have helped him tremendously. For the most part he omitted the most significant pacifists of the twentieth century. Yet he claims to offer a rebuttal to a position he doesn't remotely understand.This ill considered little book is filled with poorly examined assumptions. If you are looking for a thoughtful and biblically insightful defense of war , this is not it. But if you want a shallow piece of work that may reinforce your prejudice, When Is It Right To Fight? may be exactly what you have in mind."
2,A boring horror film...,"I sat through this all the way to the end, and I was bored stiffless. The acting was hammy and the f/x and plot were laughable. Sure its a classic, sure its 'Hammer' but who cares? This film won't appeal to the new age of horror fans. Give this film a miss. But if you like your horror corny, then this is your film."
1,HAS EVERYONE GONE MENTAL!,THIS MOVIE STUNK IN SUCH A MAJOR WAY THAT I WANTED TO BLOW MY T.V. UP WHEN THIS PIECE OF JUNK FILM WAS OVER. AND FOR THOSE OUT THERE WHO THINK THIS IS GOOD. I HAVE ONE QUESTION FOR YA. WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN SMOKING?
4,A hands On Approach To Magick,"This movie gives a realistic approach to the world of the occult. In the movie you actually see the various rites being proformed using animal sacrifice and symbols. What's interesting also, is that the movies shows you two side of the world of magick. The movie shows you how magick can be used for evil and how it can be used to protect one from the misuse of it. This movie may only be truely appreciated by those who understand the inner workings of metaphysics."
4,One to keep for years,"I've had this books for years, and I've cooked a number of recipes from it. (Notably, the turkey sausage gumbo is a favourite around the holidays). But more importantly, he inspires the reader with ideas for parties. I am planning to use his 'perfect wedding cake' for my wedding in Florida this summer; it's the most beautiful cake I've ever seen. 'Nough said. Go buy it."
4,If you liked Tender Mercies...,"If you liked Tender Mercies, you'll like this one. Americana is a surprisingly effective movie about a man's quixotic quest for peace and wholeness. Beautifully understated writing and acting. The cinematography is definitely of its time(early 1970's), and the audio sounds like fake stereo. Not letterboxed, so it feels kind of cramped at times. That said, I still recommend it to anyone who likes minimalist movies like Two-Lane Blacktop, Tomorrow and Stranger Than Paradise."
5,Plain out great X-Files book!,"What else can I say, Ground Zero is an oustanding book. Great literature, etc."
2,Doesn't Suspend my Disbelief,"This book is totally impossible, rather than implausible asmost of the X-files are"
3,I Enjoyed This Book,I enjoyed this book but i thought i could have been better. While reading this book i felt like Mulder was left out alot. But the book kept my attention. Although i thought it could have been better i reccomend this book.
2,Good idea- weak execution,"Now having read 7 books either written or co-written by Kevin J. Anderson,(3 Star Wars, 3 X-Files and 1 Dune) I can say that the man has good ideas, I just don't think that his writing is all that absorbing. As with his Star Wars books, his X-Files books never quite ring true of the characters. As for the cases, they are pretty good, but it isn't Mulder and Scully who are chasing down the monsters. Of all the new X-Files books, Charles Grant's ""Whirlwind"" nails the characters of Mulder and Scully, but the case isn't particularly involving."
4,I enjoyed it but...,"I enjoyed the book. The plot was interesting and it would be interesting to see produced. It seemed quite ""epic"" in it's proportions. However, as fun as the general plot was, for a novel if felt rather Mulder and Scully ""lite."" For an X-File book they hardly felt like they were there... or rather they were there but much of their personalities wasn't. The way the characters were shown, they just weren't quite the Mulder and Scully Xphiles know and love. The book is an interesting read but not as satisfying as the X-Files at its best."
4,Great Story falls a little short,"We really enjoyed Ground Zero--it had a great story line, but at times, it was hard to follow. I also did not think Mulder or Scully were portrayed as they are in the show. A little disappointing, but it won't turn us away from the series! GO X-FILES!"
3,Not Bad,"The thing about Peter Davison was that his first few stories were good then some of them were only mediocre. The compagions in this one were anoying(I guess I'm used to Romana and K9) This first story I'd say was pretty good kinda silly compaired to Logopolis or Keeper of Traken though. I think it was the lousy acting of the compainions more than the story. ""No! Nyssa don't touch me, I'll disolve!"" kinda thing. And that romping around the stair case thing at the end, kinda reminded me of the play room at Show Biz Pizza when I was a kid."
4,We're caught in a space-time trap!,"Considering what has happened in the previous story, Castrovalva stands up on it's own very well. Like a previous reviewer noted, Castrovalva works because of it's charm. All the actors are on good form with some good interaction between the companions. Adric is left out for most of the story, and some people would say that is not a bad thing. The first and start of the second episode are somewhat hectic, with a lot going on. Overall, it's a very good story - but make you sure watch Logopolis first."
3,A concept story that grows on you,"If memory serves, this episode is named after an Escher drawing, where stairs lead, circularly, only to themselves, and neither up nor down. In the episode, this idea is toyed with and played out as if it were a physical reality. The laid-back approach to the story, the Doctor's inability to recover his own identity (Who?), and the pleasure of watching the absurd physics unfold make this a worthy story and beginning to Peter Davison's tenure as the fifth Doctor."
4,Quite good,"This third book in a trilogy (which for once is actually derived from the miniseries instead of the reverse) is a good read. I'll grant that there are finer works on Arthurian legend (Think Stewart's Merlin trilogy, Lawhead's Pendragon cycle, Cornwell's Warlord trilogy, Attanasio's Dragon and the unicorn or even the Bradley work if you don't mind blatant feminism). Despite of that, this is a book that creates some great images of Merlin and his coming of age. I love to read about Merlin anyway and this is simply a lighter version, not something that diminished it. I'll state that this book contains several events which were not even in the film, which makes this a surprising read after all."
5,Loved this Harlem Globetrotter story when I was in 8th grade,"Been 30 some-odd years, but this book inspired me to play basketball when I was in school. Definitely had an impact, and I remebered the book but not the title, till yesterday I found my 8th grade journal and I had written excitedly that my book had arrived (shcolastic books) ""Go, Man, Go!""It Chronicles the story of the Harlem Globetrotters, how they got their start, how they improved, and how they forever changed the game. Now I am ordering a copy for my kids. I cannot say if this is a book adults would enjoy, but I loved it as a kid."
3,Interesting Novel,"Given the time period this novel was written, it is still an interesting story. The basic concepts however are much more concisely expressed in the more up-to-date book ""The Four Agreements,"" and now ""The Fifth Agreement."""
5,Refreshing and reality based,"It's not very often that you are able to come across a writer who is so charming and, at the same time, pretty far out there. I absolutely loved the book and, will truthfuly say that it has significantly changed my life for the better. It is a quick read. You will however, be tempted to read it over and over again. I won't go into what it's about. Just read it! I consider myself to have moderate to conservative taste in my reading but, this one really blew my boat totally out of the water. One warning, if you are one who is not even the slightest bit spiritual, you might not like it. Ya now, meat and potatoes only types of folk."
2,Not very helpful,"Don Juan attempts to teach Carlos Castaneda vague lessons by engaging him in a series of nonsensical activities. Many of the themes are common to other spiritual traditions (e.g. breaking routines, becoming inaccessible, not doing, or stopping the world--in the language of this book) and because of this, the reader may have a clue as to what Don Juan is getting at. However, Don Juan consistently spurns Castaneda when he asks for explanations, insisting on showing him instead. Unfortunately, the demonstrations seem to be pointless and nonsensical. Maybe, that's the point, but it gets tiresome to endure this over and over again throughout the book. I'm a big fan of psychedelic drugs and solipsistic thinking, and I approached this book with a great amount of focus but finished it mostly disappointed."
1,How to sell garbage to hippies,"Castaneda's books are garbage designed to make money from gullible hippies, and there are plenty of them still around. Caveat emptor, to say the very least."
5,The greatest book I have ever read!!!,"The greatest book I have ever read! Without a doubt Carlos Castaneda's best. This book made me SO sad it is unbelievable. Once you understand everything that is involved in becoming a man of knowledge you have to ask yourself 'am I willing to give up EVERYTHING?' After reading this book I have made loads of progress in my own spiritual quest, no, I haven't stopped the world, yet. But at least I know now which way I am heading. If your leaning is towards sorcery and the revelation of it's secrets, you simply MUST read this. I have read everything on the occult (I kid you not) and I have to say that this was the one book that 'did it for me.' God (or nagual ) bless C.C."
3,Product wasn't good,"It wasn't check carefully. As in all three books were falling apart when opened. The cover is in good condition, but inside was damage."
2,"Did not speak to me, prefer ""Peaceful Warrior"" series","How to write a review about a book that does not speak to you? Difficult. While I liked ""The Teachings of Don Juan: A Yaqui Way of Knowledge"" (at least the first part) somehow ""Journey to Ixtlan"" did not speak to me at all. It came across as boring, meaningless walking and dialogues in desert without wisdom revealing to me.I certainly preferred the whole Dan Millman's ""Peaceful Warrior"" series with spiritual wisdom weaved into interesting adventures."
4,The Best Place to Start,"I have read all the Castaneda books, and I think this is the best one to start with. In his first one,The Teachings of Don Juan: A Yaqui Way of Knowledge, Carlos is focused on the peyote/mescaline. By his own admission, he didn't really understood the drugs were just a tool - and an unnecessary one for most people - for opening his awareness. In this book, he instead focuses on what Don Juan actually taught him, and presents it in a very structured, accessible fashion. The somewhat rigid presentation of the 'lessons' keeps it from being a favorite of mine - I prefer the 'story' or even parable structure ofTales of Power, andThe Power of Silence: Further Lessons of don Juan, but this is still a great place to start overall.As for the controversies surrounding Castaneda and the existence or not of Don Juan, who cares? These are powerful books, either way. Read them as truth, read them as fiction, it doesn't matter."
5,Best movie we've seen this year,"I love Danny Kaye! This movie has everything - witty music, great dancing, funny repartee, and Danny Kaye at his best. Lyrics by Sylvia Fine kept us in stitches. A great family movie, although kids might not understand some of the lyrics."
4,Real gem of a movie,"This is a genuinely funny and charming movie. The cast all have tremendous fun, and there's plenty of time for songs, comical, panto-type escapades and romantic interludes. Basil Rathbone, as the obligatory villain, wields a fencing sword with particular menace. This is the sort of old-fashioned entertainment we should be bringing our children up watching. Good stuff."
5,Life Could Not Better Be,"I have to say that the Court Jester is my favorite movie. It will keep you entertained, and it is full of laughs. I don't need to say anymore, except that you will love it, and cherish it."
5,Magnificent Comedy,"A pleasant mix of slapstick and word play, this movie ranks up there with iconic films like the Princess Bride and Monty Python's Quest for the Holy Grail. Danny Kay and Angela Lansbury are brilliant."
4,"DANNY KAYE, A VERY TALENTED GUY.","""The Court Jester"" is one of the most original comedies that one can see: the film combines quick dialogues, physical stunts and tricks, very original jokes, screwball, slapstick and really memorable characters. Without a doubt Danny Kaye was one of the most resourceful comedians in the comedy universe, he sang with style and humor, he performed physical stunts, he said light-speed dialogues and jokes, well, he had the profile of a possible fifth Marx Brother.""The Court Jester"" has characters that can make that the audience feels comfortable, interested and identified with them. Besides, most of the scenes have at least one very funny and imaginative sequence. Danny Kaye really is one of the most underrated comedic actors, and really was a talented guy.""The Court Jester"" is recommendable for those who enjoy classic comedies."
3,Remember the times ...,"... when they'd cut off frames left and right to make Cinemascope movies 'suitable' for tv screens? It was called formatting to full screen. Now we're being sold widescreen tv's to get the full picture in all its splendor. So far, so good. Only now they're cutting full screen pictures at top and bottom to sell them to us as 'widescreen versions'. Now, this is one of my favorite movies of all times, I can't praise it enough (read all the other reviews ...). But the gall of paramount to sell this as widescreen and at that price (!) is unheard of. If I'd known what I'd get I would have stuck to my excelent VHS copy. Ten stars for the film, but I have to deduct seven for the impertinence of this [...]"
5,Perfect,"This movie is a gem. Danny Kaye plays Hubert Hawkins, Who joins up with a band of Robin Hood Clones in order to place the Real king (The baby with the Birthmark on his bottom) on the throne. He ends up getting into the palace, where he meets Sir Ravenhurst (Basil Rathbone), the Evil Bad guy. The Whole movie is a jumble of hilarious medeival misunderstandings The songs are awesome. The best part in the whole movie is the fencing scene at the end. I laughed SO hard!I highly reccommend it."
1,Court Jester DVD,I returned this DVD almost three weeks ago as it was for ZONE 1 rather than ZONE 4 [I am in Australia] so I was not able to use it. I am still waiting for some acknowlegement from Amazon that they have received it and if they will be sending me my money back or replacing the video.
5,Fun for the whole family!,This was a family favorite for me growing up and we still quote several lines from this movie. I recently introduced this movie to my young children and they liked it as well. Danny Kaye is amazing!
5,One of a kind by a one of a kind star,"My first taste of the comedic genius of Danny Kaye was when I saw this movie late one night when I was about 13. I waited anxiously for the movie to be on again and thus began my life long addiction to the sweetness of Danny Kaye. This movie is an absolute must for anyone who loves to laugh. This is one of the best musical comedies I have ever seen. The songs always manage to tug at my heart especially the lullabye. Danny was truly a one of a kind, I have yet to see an actor reach his level."
5,Great!,"I've grown up on this movie. I've loved it ever since my dad sat me down to watch it at age 10. It's got everything you would want. And my favorite line: ""I found a bow and arow and learnd to shoot. I found a horn and I learned to toot. Now I can shoot and toot; ain't I cute?"""
1,can't play the dvd,"i had no idea that this dvd wouldn't work in my USA dvd player,it would have been nice if the seller would have specified that!!what a waste of money!!"
3,Cute but not his best.,This is a cute story of course held together by the talents of Danny Kaye. Not his best but certainly worthwhile to watch.
5,Funniest film ever???,"If this film is not the funniest film ever made, then it certainly has the funniest scene ever filmed. The ""pellet with the poison"" scene is truly hilarious, and it goes on for about 10 minutes. I can't think of another picture with a scene that will make you laugh that long. Also, the image of the baby pig coming through the gate instead of the wild boar in the nighthood test makes me laugh each time I think of it. The old adage ""They don't make 'emlike this anymore"" is certainly true here and applies to the cast as well as the script."
