1,Works 1/2 the Time,"This litter box works great in theory, but in the end I still have to take the top off to scoop everything out like I would a regular litter box. The spaces in the grate are too large, more often then not pieces of my cats poop go through the grate instead of being caught by it. Also, despite the face that I got the ""Large"" box, the space inside for the cat to use is still quite small, as a result her poop often gets stuck to the side of it. I would not recommend this box for anyone, it's just a waste of money as it is."
3,Almost Perfect,"Works great - only downside is urine clumps get stuck at the bottom of the box (probably because my kitten loves to dig), so before cleaning you have to push the liter around once with a big scooper to loosen everything. Hardly a downside though and I definitely recommend it.EDIT: I also purchased the LARGE version, and it doesn't have a clip to secure the right side like the small does. This leads to litter falling out when you roll the box to clean and makes it not nearly as good."
3,In theory it's a great product....,"And it works... sorta. Basically you turn the thing on it's side and the screen will let the litter through and the poop will go into a little drawer for disposal. Well, the latch on the lid broke shortly after I started using it and then would leak litter when I would put it on it's side. Eventually I stopped using it like that and just use it as a regular cat litter box with a cover, which it works fine as...If I recall correctly it was about the same price as a covered litter box so I'm not unhappy."
2,Messy,"No less work than cleaning out a real litter box. We eventually took the lid off and just use the base. Requires a lot of space to roll. Our small children who take care of their own cats were intimidated by it. Also, kittens seems to not like the covered environment. When we removed the cover ""accidents"" elsewhere in the house came to a stop."
5,great way to clean up after your cat,"this is a great way to clean up after your cat without having to sift and sift and dump. The ""Paw- cleaner"" is easy- just roll, roll back, pull out drawer and dump. my cats love it too because it is private and my dogs hate it because they can't get to it but I really like that fact. I was not able to get at any store near me so i am glad Amazon had it available."
4,Great Idea,This litter box is very convenient. The only comment I have is about the clips used to hold the box together. I have to reinforce the box with more butterfly clips to keep it firmly closed. The clips around the box to keep it together need to be more sturdy. That is my only complaint. It sure is a lot easier to clean. Fix the clips and you have a perfect product.
5,Love It!! A Must Have,"This is amazing. I have tried many litter boxes and this one beats all. Simple and easy as 1 2 3.One Note, If you are planning to have just one litter box in your house and you have more then 1 cat, get the larger box.The one donw fall is the box area for the cats is a little small, and will fill quick in the day if you have more then one cat using it.I got the larger one and this fixed the problem.Also if your cat is over 14lb I would recomend the larger box so they have a little room to move."
4,Good product.,"I don't just give away 5 stars...it's good, interesting contraption considering how it works. It's like a tilting thing...you tilt it to move the litter to one side where it filters our the .... then you tilted it further and the... gets caught in a tray. No electricity or batteries. It looks nice too."
3,"Nice, but BUY Largest Size","I think the idea of this product is great. The rolling box is certainly helpful, but I have found that as my kitten has gotten bigger she doesn't like it as much as the open air one. She is still pretty small, but she almost makes the ""regular"" size one look too small.Pro: rolls nice and easy clean upCons: TOO small and maybe not worth the nice clean up."
3,It was ok,The top will not snap tight to the bottom. Often times litter spills out unto the floor when you tip it ovor to clean it. STILL WAY BETTER THAN SCOOPING IT OUT!!!!!!!!
3,It leaks!,"This litter box is such a great concept. I get really tired of scooping, so it's great to be able to gather all the litter at once. However, it's annoying to have the litter leak out from the sides of the box all over the floor."
3,"Simple Design, Works Fairly Well","I was thinking of getting a self cleaning box but they're pricey and most aren't rated very well so I thought I would try this one. I does what it's supposed to other than the grate the litter pours through should have smaller openings as some smaller ""nuggets"" get through and stay in the litter so you still have to scoop those out now and then. I would like it to be made a little sturdier, especially the latches but so far nothing has broke. It's pretty big also and you need room to tilt it on it's side. The tray seems to catch everything just fine and you just dump the waste in the trash and stick it back in it's hole.The cat likes it."
5,Works well,"This box works as described, is easy to use and reduces odor and litter tracking outside of box. I have an electric littermaid box also and I spend more time ""ungunking"" it than I spend rolling the Omega Paw. One word of advice though, when rolling the Omega Paw box to sift the litter, be sure to support the bottom part of the box with your hand, or the latches holding the two parts together may break. This happened to my mother's box and now it leaks a little litter on the floor each time she rolls it."
5,LOVE IT,"This is great and highly recomended. I am in the Orlando area and I searched every pet store, could not find it anywhere. I am really suprised that every single pet store doesn't carry this great item. Ended up ordering online. We have this in our large bathroom. It is so easy to clean. Just roll over and empty drawer. Cat loves to use the drawer handle to rub against. Built great, no problems with lid. Cat loves the privacy. Have been using for about two months now. The Omega litter mat does not do much good, so you really don't need it. A plain old bath mat or rug works best with the litter tracking. You will LOVE this. Makes life so much easier."
5,Best thing on the market,"I have been using the Omega Paw Self-Cleaning litter box for years. It makes cleaning the litter box so simple and mess free that I wouldn't trade it for any thing else. The best part is that it is so much cheaper than the electric self cleaning litter boxes. With the Omega Paw box you simply roll it slowly onto it's top, smack the bottom to loosen any stuck on clumps and then roll it back onto its bottom. Then you pull out the tray containing the dirty litter and dispose of it. That's all there is to it, simple, quick and inexpensive. One note, unless you have a small cat, you need to go with this larger box as the screen and tray do take up a lot of room inside the box. I highly recommend this product."
5,Best box out there!,"It is great quality, and it had helped take some of the yuck out of cleaning a litter box. I am so happy with this!"
2,Huge box with small area for waste,"I purchased this based on all the positive reviews and I must say I'm disappointed. Firstly, it needs to be cleaned every 2-3 days due to a very small area for the cat to do his business. I just measured it at 18 X 10 where as the whole unit is monstrous. Just to clean it requires lots of contortions. I have to remove whatever's on top and then rearrange a large area to roll in in. Even when I do it every few days it still clogs my tray. Most times the waste tray will open during this procedure and litter/poop gets spilled. At least with a normal litter box, I can just scoop something without all the gyrations.Overall...I'd say it's a nice concept but it's made very cheaply and doesn't work as well as I had hoped."
4,Works very well,Despite my best efforts to tighen the lid it still likes to leak a little litter on the floor. However for general use and not having to sift through litter with a scoop to get things out it works great. If the seals were a bit better this would be an easy 5 star product.
5,LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOVE IT!,"Seriously don't waste your time with other litter boxes. This is so easy to use that you don't mind cleaning your cat's litter every day. The one downside is that you do have to clean it out once in a while and that's kinda hard/gross but it comes with the territory, so whatever. I recommend this one over the smaller size too and I only have one cat who is pretty small. I owned the smaller one too and the inside was just too small so I had to upgrade. Oh and it's really not THAT big..."
2,Not that time saving,"I thought this litter box was great for the first few weeks, however, I found that I was getting a bigger mess inside because my cat would spray on the walls inside and the combination of the rolling action and the clumping cat litter did not make my life any easier! Cleaning the grill inside was frustraing! If you're looking for ease in cleaning your cat litter box- resign yourself to the fact it needs to be cleaned daily and check out alternative litters like those made from wheat or corn! Unlike clumping clay there is little dust, clumps great, and best of all no gooey stuck on clumps. (I wouldn't recommend it for this type of litter box because the granules are too big.)"
1,Very unsanitary for cats.,"This litter-box is utterly disgusting. When you roll the litter-box around, to move the dirty litter into the small bin; all the dirty litter slides across the top of the litter-box and stays there. Very unsanitary for animal. I should have thought about the mechanism before purchasing."
4,Good,Easy to clean works well. Worth the price.Once in a while have to use the scoop to knock a clump loose from the bottom. Taking it apart is easy. Latches could be better but function. Internal grate does need cleaning from clumped litter now and then. Used this 8 months and still loving the ease of cleaning.
3,Self ? Claning litter box,"The litter box is great, but the plastic fastening device's are crap. The first time I used it, it fell apart and spilled 15 pounds of litter on the floor. I had just changed the litter and there where just a few clumps in it. I dont care I, will drill holes in the edges and use machine screws with wing nut's to make it work and still be able to take it apart easily. The principle is awesome butyou cannot move it around by yourself, that include dragging it."
4,Dusty when tipped. Cat can't tip it over. Minimizes mess.,"When you go to tip it over, all the dust from the cat litter comes out of the opening and makes the air in the room all dusty. It would be better to manually scoop it because of that.I like that my cat cannot tip it over. It also keeps the mess in for the most part because of the enclosure. It a pain to take the top off though to clean the litter box. Also, when you tip it over it the filter gets blocked sometimes and a lot of clean litter gets thrown away. Some of the small pieces of cat poop get through the filter and don't get thrown away. Once again, you are better off just scooping manually. I just use it for my cat because it's enclosed which minimizes the mess. Also, it was only worth the money since I found it on sale at petco for $20."
4,small,"I love this, but I wish I had bought the larger one. Although my cat was still growing when I got this, my cat is on the smaller side, and is a short haired cat, and it just seems a bit too small for her. As a result, she likes to kick the litter out of the front of it and that makes a bit of a mess. I got a really large litter mat, and even with that mess, and still having to roll it every day to keep the box clean. still makes this MUCH better than sifting through cat poop every day in a regular litter box. (letting it go for more than a day lets the litter clump to the side of the box and then it has to be scraped off). I will buy a larger one in a little while. Even with the cost of buying two of these, it's still much much cheaper than any of those electric automatic self-cleaning litter boxes, and I think this actually works much better (compaired to the reviews I've read of the electric ones). Overall, very satisfied! I HATE sifting through cat poop!"
3,HELP!! Litter stick on bottom :-<,"I was so excited to find this litter box - basically same logic with Litter Robot but a lot cheaper and does not require electricity! Well, it seemed working for few days but then I noticed odor getting stronger and stronger. First I thought that it was because I am not using feline pine anymore (which is best to eliminate odor, in my opinion). Then, I finally found out after few days that the litter stick on bottom and causing the odor! Ever since I basically need to scoop it every time after I rolled the box. I wonder if anybody else is having similar issue?? I am using swheatscoop.<UPDATE>I had received feedback suggesting to increase the amount of litter. I am using almost entire swheatscoop box (12.3 lb) but still problem continues. Two cats are using it, so maybe I should switch to multi-cat swheatscoop, not the original. Although both cats are relatively small (8.5 and 8 pounds)."
4,Like Magic,"I'd been looking for a solution to the daily sifting ritual, and considered buying any one of the more expensive, fully automated cat boxes. But, when I watched the cheesy demo by the Paw self-cleaning litter box's inventor ([...]) I was intrigued. For the 30-some-odd dollars, I couldn't have asked for a better product! It took about 3 minutes to assemble and worked like (insert expletive) magic. My cat started using it right away and she loves it as much as I do (she had never used a covered box before, but took to the Omega with no problem). If I had to find a single criticism it is that smaller poopy bits tend to make it through the slats, and so don't always find their way to the disposal tray, but I guess that's why you're supposed to change all the litter each month. Other than that, no complaints. This product is everything it promises, with way less hassle and for much less coin than the slew of litter robots on the market. Simply brilliant."
5,"Excelente caja de arena, muy facil de usar y limpiar","Esta caja de arena se las recomiendo mucho, desde que la traje el gato la usó sin problemas. La tenía en el exterior de la casa y aún después de 2 años de uso sigue casi igual que nueva. Es muy facil usarla, solo la giras y las bolas caen en el pequeño cajón mientras la arena se filtra a traves de la rejita, despues solo sacas el cajón y tiras su contenido en la basura y lo insertas de nuevo. Hay que rellenar arena unas 2 veces a la semana pero en poca cantidad, asi que no hay mucho desperdicio."
2,"Not the better ""litter box""","Definitely an improvement over the open litter boxes that we had...but not the ""wonder"" litter box that I had hoped it to be...I don't know about anyone else, but both the hand sifters and the sifter inside this box do not sift out the ""feces crumbs"" that break away from the large clumps of waste. So, I'm still waiting for someone to invent the perfect or at least, better litter box...this isn't it. Save your money and just buy an enclosed box (which we didn't have, so this is better in that sense)."
2,Litter boxes-Omega,I've had this type litter box for many years. This one here is disappointing because the plastic clips that hold the box together are not good. I already have 1 that broke. I'm always very carefull when putting the box back together after cleaning it and don't understand why it broke so easy. I glued it with crazy glue but of course it didn't hold. So I'm very disappointed.
2,Disappointed,"I was expecting to love this litter box because it was recommended to me at a veterinarian's office. However, one of the sliding latches does not close and litter drips out when I turn the box over causing extra work vacumning up the littler. It is heavy and ackward for me to roll over. The best part is that the waste DOES fall into the internal box and it is easy to remove and throw away. That was what I was hoping for and got. Since I purchased it on line and threw away the shipping box, I have no idea how to deal with the manufacturer about a defective product. If it closed property, I would deal with the ackwardness of rolling it over. It would be very difficult to find a large box and ship it backc to the factory. Cost around $32. Any suggestions?"
1,Cheap construction and terrible customer service.,"I bought this box because of the price and the fact that so many people claimed that it was a good product. Before I purchased mine at petsmart, I inspected it for all of the clips, it was in perfect condition. As I left the store, an employee stopped me to say that it was the ""best litterbox ever"". I disagree. After two weeks, one of the clips broke, rendering it useless. I emailed the company, provided them my address and never received the clips that they promised. Two months later, I emailed about the clips, this time around they completely ignored my email. I emailed them again today but after five months of asking for the same thing, I'm over it.This box sucks. The company sucks even more."
5,My 3rd one,"Ok..they don't last forever..this is the 3rd one I've owned in 12 years. I've tried the electronic ones out and they never did the job. I have 3 cats...one of which is a very large American shorthair who is also very messy. Switching to the larger one of these boxes solved all of my problems of litter on the floor and made him very happy. He can turn around inside with no problems.Cleaning is wonderfully easy and complete and because of it's design it keeps odors at a minimum. When this one finally needs replacing, I will buy another (probably in 4 years or so)."
4,Best litter box I've ever owned,"I was so close to buying another automated litter box when I came across someone touting the Omega Paw as ""The worlds best litter box"".I have used the box now for 3 weeks and I have to say that I whole heartedly agree that this is quite possibly the worlds best litter box.It takes 30 seconds to roll the box sideways, empty the tray, and voila! it's clean. The cats love it. There are no motors or anything that can malfunction like my old Littermaid. I can honestly say it's a pleasure to clean the litter box.Only reason I didn't give this a perfect 5/5 is that when you roll the box sideways,you sometimes get a little litter seep out of the box seams, which requires vacuuming. This is only a minor thing though. It's hard to believe that this box is so inexpensive. I would have gladly paid triple for this item."
3,Litter Box review,"I like this one okay. Good points are the privacy and the idea. Bad points are that I end up having to get the scoop out anyway to get it all. Overall, I would recommend it."
5,Best Litter Box Ever,"The Omega Paw is fantastic. Simply roll to the right, the clumps get dropped into the removable tray, the good litter is caught in a separate compartment, roll back left, remove the tray and dump. It's that simple."
5,"simple, affordable, innovative!","We had trouble getting our kittens to stop ""playing"" in their open litter boxes. I was looking for a closed box and stumbled upon this wonderful product as a bonus! The kittens are much more relaxed going into this box and the clean-up is so easy to do. Just tilt to the right, then back to the left! It also cuts down on dust. Having a controlled exit allows for less litter getting tracked past my mat. Overall this is a great thing to have.**Make sure to tap the litter box when you are finished rotating to get some of the waste stuck to the bottom.**"
5,Just buy it,"This thing is NICE. When I got it, I set it up next to my old litterbox to make sure the cat adjusted. She did her business in it on the first day, so I CAREFULLY poured the contents of the old box into this one. Then did the ROLL to separate out the surprises from the clean litter. It works perfect!I haven't had problems yet, but I did notice a couple things-- If you are using cheap litter that doesn't clump well, this might not work very well. I use Tidy Cat Scooping litter in the 35lb tub and it works great. My coworker says he had poor luck with this litterbox, but I think he buys the cheapo litter.- You should put a lot of litter in this box. If the liquid hits the plastic, it might build up smell over time. I put about 3"" on the bottom. The cat seems happier, and only the ""dirty"" litter is thrown out so you're not wasting litter."
3,good size cats like it but not so easy to clean!,My cats like its size and will use it. But I am not finding it so easy to tip and turn to clean. Maybe it takes practice.
4,Cute.,"The littler box is cute and small. I'd actually recommend getting the bigger one unless you have a teeny cat. I have a small one, but I keep the top off and just scoop manually. The vent part on the inside that sifts the litter through makes the perfect little shelf for the scooper and air freshener!"
4,Can't Beat It,"It's as easy as 1,2,3. It's a breeze, and one of the best buys I've made from Amazon. My cat, Cocoa, loves to watch me tip it.One problem! I now have another, larger cat, who can't quite fit in this litter box and ends up going outside the box. I had to take it apart and use it like a regular litter box. So if you have a smallish cat this is the best buy for you."
2,Doesn't work,"I've tried every different way there is, my son tried, too, but only got a turd or so. No urine clumps. All the litter goes through this filter, but then it ALL goes back into the litter box. With most of the poop and urine clumps back inside the litter box. If anyone has used this litter box and got it to work, please let me know what you did!!"
2,Box is over-rated: stick with a simple box,"I had high hopes for this box after reading the reviews on Amazon but after I received it, I realized I would not be able to use it as intended for my cats. The part of the box that is actually available for a cat is much smaller than what appears in the photos (even for the large box). There just isn't enough space for my cats to comfortably turn around and dig inside the litterbox.The top of the box has to be latched into the bottom part for the ""self-cleaning"" steps. This means that cleaning the litter box is not simple. Perhaps, if your litter clumps never sticks to the sides it might work.Anyway, I have ended up using only the bottom of the Omega box as a regular open litter box. The cats sometimes use the top that I have placed elsewhere as an igloo!"
3,The large box doesn't work as well as the medium,"Someone warned me that the large box leaks when you tip it to move the litter into the pan. It's a great idea, but in reality it didn't work for me. The litter spilled out the side and my cat hated the lid."
3,"Great Idea, poor construction.","After my chocolate lab stuck his nose in the kitty box, my kitty decided to not to use her box. I got this box in the hopes that she would give it try. She has indeed been using the box, the problem is the box is not so great. The latches on the side of the box do not seal tight enough resulting in litter spilling out when you turn the box. The box itself takes up a lot of space, but you have to plan for more to allow for the rolling of the box. I really wanted to love this product, it could be fantastic - its just not built well."
1,returned it - the plastic tabs holding the item together are very flimsy- correct this and it would be a great product,"has a design flaw but great idea- the tabs are so flimsy i returned it just after trying to put it together. even that almost made them break- i can't imagine having to use them for months on end and BELIEVE ME- the design of this box makes it so that the tabs are extremely important. if they break, the whole thing is unusable"
3,My Experience Was Not Great,"I purchased this box on amazon about 6 months ago.The first issue was the actual space available for my kitties to use the box - with the ""patented grill"" mechanism taking up about 1/3 of the box, there is not much room left for the actual litter portion of the box. My biggest problem was that the litter would spill out of the back when I attempted to roll the box. I will say that it does work, however, I found it to be more time consuming to clean up the spilled litter than to just scoop the old fashion way so I ended up dropping it off at my local thrift store. Maybe someone else will have better results."
2,"Yes, I put it together right. Yes, I threw it away.","I really wanted to like it. I liked the idea of not having to get so up close and personal with cat poop all the time but it just didn't work very well. The litter stuck to the bottom too much so I ended up having to take it apart and scrape off the bottom and remove the smaller chunks that fit through the screen every few days. The worst part was the litter that clumped to the screen. It had to be scraped and rinsed off which was a less than pleasant experience. After a couple weeks I was going to wash it out because it started to smell to much like cat pee but I just decided to throw it away instead, it was less work just to scoop the poop by hand."
1,Problems,"I am using a high absorbent litter in the box; however, when I rolled the box to the right to clean, urine leaked out onto my floor. I'm not sure how it happened and I don't recall seeing other reviews about this problem, but that has been my experience. I think the best option for me is to go back to using a standard enclosed litter box and continue to scoop the clumps out with the scooper."
5,Could not be easier to use! A winner!,"This cat litter box is superior to all others, even the electric kind - which I have tried.Cleaning is just a matter of rolling upside down and then back again and then emptying the cartridge. So simple. The reason why this model is BETTER than my electric models I have owned is that it requires no batteries, my cats aren't afraid of it, it is a private enclosure AND it will NEVER BREAK! my electric one broke after a year and at $100 I feel that the price was just not worth it! This one is a fraction of that price and will never break.The only thing you need to consider is that you will need ample space to ""Roll"" it on it's top and back again. If you buy the large size plan for at least 3 feet."
2,Not very good,"I thought I would be buying something that would be a lot better than scooping litter out. 1st I noticed it is using way too much cat litter. When I go to pull out the thing for the poop, it is mainly cat litter & even if I rock it back & forth, I end up with either no poop, or nothing to pull out. I would not recomment this to anyone that is looking for a self cleaning box, I was using up an entire 20 pound bag of litter in less than 1 week, and still was not getting all the cat poop. I am back to taking the top off to get the poop without getting all the clean litter out, so do not buy this one, I'm going back to my old one as it is bigger, and holds more, and this one is worthless!"
5,BUY THIS! Forget about Littermaid!,"In the interest of helping out other cat lovers, I am posting this review. I threw away three perfectly operational LitterMaid automatic cat boxes when I saw how well this worked, and then I ordered a second one of these.It works just like they say, and if you use FLUSHABLE litter, not only do you spare yourself the nastiness of having to bend over and chisel cat poop off the appliance/litter box (due to the great engineering of this catbox), you don't have to carry a ninety pound back of you know what out to the trash, making the trash collectors hate you when the bag breaks (because you carried the slide out drawer with huge handle to the toilet and flushed it).It now takes 30 seconds to clean my cat box, and is 98% less disgusting. We no longer fight about whose turn it is, because I don't mind doing it.Added bonus: unlike the Littermaid, you never, ever have to buy accessories for it."
2,Depends on your cat,"Our cats pee against the edge of the box a lot, so the litter tends to stick to the wall somewhat. Not a problem to remove typically, but not going to separate from the wall with just a roll, so we ended up still having to use the scooper. Also, I found it difficult to roll without getting clean litter in the removal tray, but that could just be the type of litter I used.Unrelated to my review of the product functionality, one of our cats decided she didn't like the new box and started peeing outside the box, so be hesitant before switching to a new type of box. We switched back to a regular box and problem solved."
2,"Okay Product, Has Major Flaws","I purchased this product a few months ago and have used it since. The concept is a good one, but there are a few major flaws, such as:1) the filter grate let's small pieces through thereby never trapping them in the receptacle.2) The filter grate doesn't snap into place at the base. There are holder tabs, but the grate is not secure and that makes it not work properly.3) The top portion of the litter box does not ""seal."" It's somewhat tight, but there is litter seeping from the seams everytime it's cleaned. Every time!With a couple important modifications, this could be a really terrific product. But, I'm in the market for soemthing better!"
5,Omega Paw Self-Cleaning Litter,"Omega Paw Self-Cleaning Litter Box, Regular, Green and BeigeOmega Paw Self-Cleaning Litter Box, Regular, Green and BeigeI read all of the user reviews and took a chance! My cat loved it as soon as I set it up. I had no problems switching from the conventional messy, smelly, dirty liter box to a Palace! No problems with anything! Simple 2 minute set up and my Cat used her new litter home within the first five minutes! No Smells, No Messes! Simply roll the unit over and presto! Everything is placed in a pull out drawer! Amazing and simple and I No longer hate cleaning the litter box! No More Nasty Smells! The best part is that I've already Saved $20.00 in liter just the fist two months!Must have for all Cat Lovers! My Kitty Loves her Privacy! I read complaints about this unit. I found NO Complaints! I love it!PURRRRRRRRRRRRR :)"
5,Pleasing Pixie- 4 paws up,I was worried that Pixie would not use the new litter box because it has a hood. She took right to it and it has made my life so much easier. It is so quick and you never touch the clumps! Just be careful and don't put too much kitty litter in the box or you won't be able to tip the box to get all the clean litter to go through the vent/ screen and be able to separate the clumps.
4,Omega paw litter box is awesome,"No more scooping- heaven! This is a great product if you remember a couple of things:-don't bend the little screen too much or it will break,-make sure the clips are securely fastened and check them every once in a while,-roll it over slowly"
2,I really wanted to love this,"The reviews for this were so positive that I couldn't wait for mine to arrive. However, I haven't had such good luck with it in the month or so I've owned it so far.The problem is that once I've rolled it to the right to collect the clumps, a slight leftward roll/tap does not sufficiently send the clean litter back into the bin, but keeps it in the disposal tray. Perhaps it's because Feline Pine clumping litter is very lightweight relative to sand/silica/clay litter, but it's just not working at all. On top of that, any effort to gently tap the clean litter from the right side of the box ends up spilling litter out the front.I was really hoping this would be a life-changing product, but so far I'm disappointed."
5,A Time Saver,This makes life so much easier when if comes to cleaning your cats litter box. I was in the market for a self cleaning litter box then I found this one. For the cost I decided to try it and if it didn't work I would get the more expensive self cleaning. I received it in the mail and it took me 5 mins to assemble. Filled it with litter and waited the next day to see how it worked. To my surprise it worked perfectly. Just roll it upside down then back. To clean the box it takes 2 secs and it cost 1/4 of the cost for a self cleaning. I highly recommend this litter box.
1,So Disappointed!!!!,"I liked it, and initially thought it was great. But I have owned it for less than 60 days, and the clips that hold the top to the bottom have broken rendering inoperable. I can no longer ""roll"" it, it is now just a regular litter box with a lid. And to add to the disappointment, I can't return it. Broken in less than 60 days, and I can't return it for a refund or exchange!!! Not right. The clicks are not strong enough. All I did was ""roll-it"" twice a day and then removed the litter as instructed. I will look around and see if I received any kind of product guarantee but I doubt it."
1,Didn't work well for me :(,"Not good for corner & side whizzers. I was really excited about this product, but after using it for 2 months I find that it's no good. My cat is not that big (11 lbs) yet the large box seemed too small for her. She would sometimes poop outside the box on the floor (disgusting!!) or have her body half outside of the box in order to cover her waste. Also, they should make the lid clear so you can see what's going on inside because there may be stains that get all over the sides if you flip the box when the cat has just gone."
4,Rolling Litter Box,I really like the Omega Paw Litter Box. It's pretty easy to use and the best part is you don't have to scoop. I've bought 5 over the course of 8 years. The reason being - the plastic absorbs the odor and over time it becomes stinky (and also to upgrade to the larger sizes.) My last one I replaced after about 2 years. So that's not too bad. These litter boxes aren't too expensive so it's worth the replacement in my opinion.
2,More hassle than a normal litter box,"I agree with Cat Lady. I've had this box for about a year now and it's been more of a pain than it is convenient. The rolling option is nice, but lots of little pieces go through the grating and clumps somehow get stuck on the other side of the grating/wall that sit there until you clean the whole box and find a whole army of nuggets. My biggest problem with the box is that I thought this would be big enough for our cat (15-16lbs), but it's not. He's able to get through the hole, but there's no room inside of the box. He's housebroken, yet he still doesn't find enough room in the box, so his butt sticks out of the entrance of the box and he leaves a little mess on the mat for me to clean up. The grating/wall takes about 1/3 of the box up. I took the top off of the litter box and he had no problems. The design needs to be revisited, or why not create an XL version?Bottom line, not big enough for large cats."
5,Works Great,This product works just like they say. If you have more than one cat you should not go for more than two days before you clean it. That makes it a lot easier to maintain.
4,Pretty Great for a manual Litter Box,"Not going to lie, I don't hate it. I've had 3 automatic litter boxes since I've owned my cat (about 4 years) and each one has found a way to break. I was done spending hundreds of dollars for the newest great automatic cleaner, and finally researched this bad boy to find the happiest of customers. Well, for not being an automatic box... this this is pretty amazing. Yes, I have to pay attention more, but I'm saving on litter and electricity. I'm going to agree with everyone who has given this a good rating, and recommend this to anyone sick of changing the trays on an electric box, and spending the $$$$$$$ on replacements."
3,"Good for a while, then she stopped using it","What a simple product that is so effective. I've seen and tried these 100$+ automated litter box cleaners that are junk. This one just employs a simple design but it so effective. The large size is plenty big and cleaning it is truly a breeze. Well done designers, you guys nailed it.Update 12/15/2011My cat gave up using this and started going in front of the box. Unfortunately we reverted back to the standard litter box and she is happy. Good idea but not all cats like to go inside litterboxes. Oh well."
3,"Great concept, cheap design","This litter box has a great concept but a cheap design. It's unfortunate that the company that makes this lacked confidence in it's ability to use better materials. The concept is unqique and works with the exception that I have a lot of trouble locking the cheap plastic ""locks"" in place so now I'm afraid to roll it over because I don't want cat litter to fall out on the floor. I wish they would have upgraded the thickness of the plastic and the locks to produce a sturdier litter box because I would have been willing to pay more for it."
2,Lasted a month before one of the tabs broke,"The design is great and it makes emptying the litter box a slightly easier chore. Unfortunately, one of the sliding tabs that holds the lid onto the base broke already. This makes it unusable because the litter leaks out when the box is rolled. I should be able to fix the tab but I'm disappointed that one of them broke already. If they had used a more durable material for the tabs, I'm sure this wouldn't have happened. Oh well, you get what you pay for."
5,All I can say is WOW!,"This has to be the best litter box we have ever used! If you have multiple cats and scoop once a day or more this is such a great solution. We have 4 indoor cats and this box has been a blessing. Fill it up with litter and then turn it on it's side once a day, empty the drawer, and you have sifted litter and a scooped box! It's big enough that our 18lb cat fits into it with no issues but not so big that it takes up a ton of space. We will never use another litter box again."
4,It Works!,"Love it! The Omega works as advertised. Two helpful hints1. Make sure to clean it only when the litter is completely dry, i.e. give it some time after the most recent cat visit to roll it over. The clumped litter moves into the disposal tray area much easier.2. You basically have to roll it almost completely over to get the clumps into the chamber. And ROLL is the key word. Rolling allows the clean litter to sift into the grate before you turn it over all the way to get the clumps into the tray area -avoids getting the clean litter in the disposal tray.No more scooping and quick, clean disposal!"
2,good in theory..not so much in reality,"we recently adopted a stray cat and i went searching the web for a litter box. we've only ever owned dogs so this was very new to me. I came across the omega paw and thought it was an awesome idea!! i've had the box for a lil over two weeks and i've already given up on the rolling. it never dawned on me that turning it completely over would leave the pooh to roll along the grate and ceiling leaving the box extremely funky after you ""cleaned"" it. not to mention you're supposed to clean it everyday because the space is so small. Instead of throwing it out, i removed the tray (so now she has a lil window to peep out of lol) and the divider so she can use the entire box and i open and scoop! MUCH roomier and less smelly!!"
1,We have the large and small,"the large never closed right. we replaced the 1st and the 2nd didn't work either. We taped and untaped for awhile, but come on-. The box itself requiers maintainance, so how does that safe time? We are looking at automatics."
3,Adequate,"I purchased this last fall and have been using it for at least six months.I have a kitten (~1 year old) who will probably be a medium-large size cat. I purchased the large box and think this may be too small for her or will eventually be. She can turn around in it, but may not be able to once she reaches her full size.The litter tray doesn't stay flush with the box, so when you turn it upside down, some litter will fall out.The vents aren't small enough to catch some pieces of cat poop, which means that unless you completely change the litter, you may have feces in the litter for awhile. The box is rather large and unwieldy to make changing the litter easy.Having said all this, I still prefer using this box to a regular open cat litter box."
1,SUCKS,This product came without the clips to keep it secure. Had to jerry rig it and the litter still comes out all over the place. I had one before so I know how it's supposed to work.How they could send one like this is beyond me. Do not order from these people!! Would have given it no stars if I could.
4,Awesome.,"I have 7 cats, and I Love this box... I do wish it had a bigger opening. I know they have 2 sizes, and I have the largest. However 2 of my cats are chunkers and will not get in this thing, also one of the boys does not really squat to pee and hits the unit right in the crack, and it leaks out the back side.But still I really like the concept, I would love to convert all my litter boxes to these types, but the opening is to small/or to high. There is no real seal from top to bottom. and I wish the capture trey would 'lock in' or fit in the unit better. I also am using the swheat scoop litter... nice to roll the unit n flush away.. makes litter box duty a real breeze.A few improvements and this would be perfect."
4,Life got a little bit better :o),"I really disliked cleaning the litter box. I would always put it off too long and then felt horrible for my kitty. This litter box makes it so much easier, and I empty the litter a whole lot more now than I used to.Giving the box a roll, tap and then back over is all it takes...then dump the waste and you are done.I did have one day when the lock on the front of the box came undone and the litter started to come out the side when I rolled it over. Not a fun mess, so I now do a quick check and make sure all of the locks to keep the top on are secure before I roll and tap.I love that I don't have to buy liners for the cat box any more. I love that it takes less than a minute to clean it. I love that I don't have to feel guilty because I put the job off for so long. I'm certain my kitty is happy about that, too.I think who ever thought of this is a genius.If you really hate cleaning the litter box...this is definitely for you!"
5,Save your back!,"This litter box is fantastic. Sit down on a chair, roll it over, roll it back, and you're done. Just pull out the tray and take away the clumps. I foster several cats at a time, and this box saves the scraping, bending, and stirring. I highly recommend it. The person who made the video showing how it works should get litter for life. I would not have bought it from the description only.Jdakotaj"
2,Created more work for me,"Purchase this litter box 3 months ago or so.. I have two cats sharing the Large Omega Paw Self-cleaning litter box. First off, I wish this litter box comes with odor absorbing filter because it has cause my room to stink a lot more before.Other than the regular cleaning by rotating litter box. I still have to open the litter and scoop out the smaller pieces that pass thru the gap when rotating.Will be switching back to my old litter box."
4,Good and simple design,"Works well, but check your local Petco and PetSmart store first. Even with tax, it's usually cheaper than offered on Amazon (at the time I wrote this)"
2,Back to scooping litter,"This looked like a good deal since I have 3 cats and get tired of shoveling through the litter box. However, after a few days I realized the negative things that concerned me. You can only use a small amount of litter, it does not control the dust problem, you have to roll it 3 - 4 times a day for the best results. So it's back to the litter box for me."
2,Waste. Of. Money.,"Seriously. I was woo'd by the idea of a less cumbersome litter box. The honest truth of the matter is that this is just a DIFFERENT solution to the same problem. I never found it to be that difficult to simply lift the lid off of the litter box. With this one, you need plenty of space to roll, tip, shake, roll back, tip again and then tip backwards to add more litter. No liner, means smelly...period...even on day one. If you have more than one cat...clumps can be big, this will defeat the purpose. Just get a normal litter box...you will be happier.On a side, Antik from Amazon's customer service was a star, so I do not have to feel jipped at the end of the day."
1,What were they thinking?,"This litterbox is a total disappointment. It is NOT self-cleaning,you need to clean it constantly. When a cat urinates the litter clumps and spreads and it does not go into the collector box, so you end up dis-assembling the entire box to dig the clumps out. There are plastic clips that hold the box together which will not hold up through very many re-assembling bouts."
1,A waste of money,This is a flimsy mess. The top is a pain to replace and the litter is easily kicked out of the box.
1,would have been good if only wasn't made so cheaply,would have been good if only wasn't made so cheaply.genius idea but product totally is awful. the cover doesn't stay on.litter gets in the receptable- more trouble than it is worth.
1,"Poo under my nails, clips don't come together, ineffective and dangerous","Omega Paw Self-Cleaning Litter Box, PewterIt was impossible from the start to put the litter box together properly because the clips would not slide into place or if they did at first, they soon slid right back out again.I tried to follow the instructions but nothing worked the way it was supposed to.I think my cat likes going inside a closed space, but he doesn't like sitting around in his own poo.IF I do continue to use this, I will probably simply stick in a rake and get the stuff out that way or put on gloves and pick out the turds one by one.The only reason I'm likely to keep it at all is that I am soon going to have eye surgery for cataracts and I keep getting dust in my eyes from cat litter. The lid does seem to protect me from that."
1,So disappointed,"A good friend of mine recommended this box and the reviews seemed so wonderful that I was actually oddly excited to recieve this product. Unfortunately, when I set it up the front latch did not close properly at all and litter spilled out the sides, all over my floor. I'm just glad I was able to return this. I am sure if it was better constructed it would be great since the idea of the roll scoop system seems great, but the poor construction makes it a terrible product."
3,Not large enough!,"The description states that it is for use by large cats, however, if you cat is over 10 pounds I do not think this is large enough. My cat is 12 pounds, and when I read the dimensions I thought the box would be sufficiently large. I did not take into account the plastic grate which cuts the size of the box nearly in half! There is no way my cat could fit into it once assembled."
1,An Omega Mess,"I'm not sure why so many people are saying how wonderful this contraption is. But its so not true in my case. The first thing I said was wow this is a great invention....until I got it home. What a waste of money and time. I found myself wondering why the stupid contraption wouldnt allow the litter to ""roll"" and that stupid plastic ""gate"" that holds the mess is just too flimsy. Such a waste..."
1,why?,why would you buy this? This product is spreading the urine and fecal matter all over the box. You are asking for your cat to us your house as a litter box if you buy this!
1,Not what i expected!,Not what i expected... it is not self cleaning... you have to roll it over and back again... it is not electric or battery operated... and where your cat goes is way to small.. the box itself is big.. just not where your pet goes to do there bussiness
1,Does not work,What a waste of money. Cat will not use with cover on. Does not clean itself. Only used for a couple days.
4,I like,"I got this litter box because my son was always complaining about cleaning our other box. I thought this would be easier and he'd put up less of a fuss. It's a great box for our 2 cats. Cleans super quick. I don't know if my cats just pee a lot or what, but we have to clean the box twice a day or the vent for the litter to go through gets clogged up with clumped litter. Our other box we only had to clean once a day. Even so, cleaning this one twice a day is easier than cleaning our old one once so I can't really complain."
5,WOW>,"I was skeptical when I purchased this. After all a litter box is a litter box right? How could it make that much difference? Wrong! This is so easy to use & makes it much less of a hassle to clean the litter box. Just roll it over onto its top then roll it back over. Take out the tray & dispose of the waste. No more scooping, no more dirty scooper laying around & a lot less mess. The cats seem to like it too. I left the other litter box so they could make the transition & they immediately stopped using the old box & started using the new one. Wish I had discovered this litter box long ago."
3,Works as advertised,"This does what the manufacturer says it does. It's a little messy, but no messier than the expensive ""self-cleaning"" boxes I tried, and it works just as well. It's not perfect, but it saves my back from all the scooping I had to do with regular litter boxes. My cat had no problem getting used to it, and seems to like it as well as any other litter box. It is quite large, as others have said, and you do have to have about five feet available to do the rolling, but other than that, it's a bargain."
4,Great buy!,This product is great - it saves so much time compared to conventional litter boxes. I would recommend this product; I have two cats using it right now.
2,not what i was expecting.,"it says that you just turn it on the side and it will sift the litter, this is true. but it does not mention what a mess it makes. the waste drags along the side so the inside of the box gets so dirty the cats won't use it. I have to clean it almost every other day b/c the smell gets really bad. also, there is not much room in there for the cats.it is self cleaning, meaning i have to wash it myself to keep it clean.i don't recommend spending the money. You end up having to clean it out all the time any, there isn't much of a difference from scooping out of the old ones. I still have to deal with the mess. If you want a good one buy the automatic littermate one. i have that one now it it's great."
4,Good item,Great item except the lock tabs are hard to keep locked...ended up litter all over my floor.I would recommend this item.
1,Lots more work and awful to clean,"I am not a cat person but when my little girl said all she wanted was a kitty for Christmas I gave in. I really hate cat litter smells and dealing with cat liter so this seamed like an ideal solution. (we live in rural Colorado so the cat had to be an indoor cat because of the wild life outside) After carefully reading the instructions to make sure I was doing as directed I had cat litter everywhere. You have to hold the lid in place or it will come open. The next nice surprise is all the crap literally along the sides that I now have to wash off or have that wonderful lingering smell of cat crap everywhere. And yes I am using clumping litter and not the cheap stuff. I drove over forty miles to Pet Smart to get the ""good litter"". I have since bought a traditional litter box and am scooping daily rather than deal with this tumble and spread crap everywhere contraption. It is a lot less aggravating.going with the traditional litter box."
3,Poor quality. Company needs better QC,The top and bottom did not fit perfectly together so the clips don't work properly and this causes litter to spill out when you turn it.
1,OK,"More work then before I got it and saw one in a store for cheaper,my cat was afaid of it and it's not easier to clean."
3,It is what it is,"Seems straightforward but pretty difficult to figure out sometimes and occasionally leads to more questions than solutions. The plastic parts seem cheap and mass produced. Oh, also, it's cheaper on petco.com"
2,Disappointed,"If I could return this, I would. What a waste of money--I read all the reviews on it before buying, and was excited to try it. I assembled it and put litter in it, and the next day decided to try it out. I rolled it like the directions said, and litter leaked out all over the carpet, even though I triple-checked the locks and they were all sealed. I had rolled it until it was laying on its top, and then rolled it back. It only picked up the poop, and not all of it. Clumps of urine were still in the box. I had to vacuum the floor afterwards. It ended up causing me more trouble than anything! I don't remember the last time I was so disappointed in a product I ordered off Amazon, especially one with such high reviews.I ended up removing the grate and scoop and turning it into a plain, large litter box for our two cats. I'm glad they at least have a roomier box. I don't recommend this product at all... don't waste your money."
2,not bad,"Beautiful but where there is a problem in the home does not leave the dirt because of this problem, but excellent designBut there is a problem, processors seem to chop old"
4,works great after difficulty getting it assembled,What a wonderful idea. It works beautifully but I had difficulty getting it together (inadequarte instructions printed on the packaging) and the clips that hold top and bottom together are small for the job they need to do. I solved the assembling problem by making two phone calls and getting the instructions emailed to me from the manufacturer. The dinky clip problem was solved by the addition of a large office clip to the front edge and it now looks strange but works beautifully. I hope the Omega Paw Co. is able to correct these two problems in the future. It is a great invention.
3,Easy to use box but...,"the moist litter from pee will stick to the grate (we've used several types of clumping litter with the same result). This means that a lot of the clean litter will not enter that section and ends up going into the tray which makes it heavy and awkward when pulling it out and emptying it. Also, smaller clumps will get caught behind the grate and you have to take apart the entire box to clean. Once moist litter dries on the grate, it's very hard to remove. We've used these boxes for several years and have had to replace the clips several times. I don't find them any easier to keep clean than regular boxes. We have 4 cats and I've replaced 2 boxes with regular litter boxes and I'm planning on replacing the other two Omega's with regular boxes."
2,"Great idea, bad execution","I have tried two different sizes of this litter box and have the same problem with both- when you roll the box, lots of loose litter comes out in between the seams. It is great at quickly getting all the poop out so you don't have to pick it out, but then there is a big pile of litter on the floor. Also, the binder/clasps on my large size box did not line up well with the slots so that I had to use a wrench to pull the binder shut. Way too much hassle."
3,"Neat idea, not practical","You're supposed to be able to use this box without liner bags. If you do that, cat pee and litter clump together on the bottom of the box and smells it up horribly. There are no bags that I have found that are big enough to fit this litter box, so we end up stretching a ""jumbo"" liner which causes rips and holes and the litter ends up going underneath the bag after you flip it to empty the dirt. If it wasn't for that, this would be such a great idea and so much easier."
2,Dumped litter all over my bathroom,"I had high hopes for this litter box, but in actuality it doesn't work well.The clips that hold the top on are flimsy and flexible.I had all of them clipped in securely, and after a few items hefting this big thing over to sift the litter, one of the clips unlatched and dumped litter all over my bathroom.That was the straw that broke the camel's back... but I was already considering returning it because the sifting function doesn't account for when a cat pees to the bottom.Therefore there end up being clumps that you have to pry off using a scooper... which I had completely removed from the bathroom but I guess it is needed after all.So... turns out to be more trouble than it is worth.Returning item today."
3,Difficult to clean,"This litter box is very easy to use, and I didn't have a problem with any parts breaking. The trough that pulls out never had excess litter in it. However, as others have mentioned, you have to vacuum after every roll, and it is a pain to clean. There are too many individual parts to scrub, and the screen that filters the clumps from the clean litter was the most time consuming to clean. After over a year of using this box, I have recently thrown it away, and am now using sifting bags, which make the whole experience much easier and cleaner."
2,Disappointing,"I was hopeful that I would love this box, but I don't. You cannot use it with regular litter unless you want a dust storm in your face. I tried it with fresh step. You can't use it if your litter box is tucked in a corner because you need lots of room to roll it. If you need to pull it in order to roll it on it's top, it is very hard to keep the sliding locks from coming loose. There is more than a ""little"" bit of litter that escapes from the seams, requiring a clean-up each time it is rolled. I was using 2 conventional litter boxes and didn't get as much litter tracked as I did with just one roll. I gave it 2 stars because it is a neat idea, just not for me.A tip for first time users: Don't put too much litter in the bottom or you will have a tray of litter in addition to the waste."
2,Disappointing,"I have had my eye on this litter box for months. After reading so many positive reviews I finally decided to go for it. My cat seems to like it but she isn't really finicky about litter boxes. I don't like it nearly as much as she does, probably because her favorite place to pee is on the little shelf thing on the inside, above the grate. I discovered this when I rolled it to the side and a significant amount of urine dribbled out down the side of the box and onto the floor. I can't get her to stop peeing there so now I have an oddly shaped covered litter box without the extra functionality I paid for. I didn't really like the system to begin with either, but I didn't have a lot of time to perfect my rolling technique before my cat discovered her new favorite pee spot. As excited as I was about this product, I can't really recommend it. I'm glad it works so well for so many other people, but for me it was a waste."
3,kind of messy to clean up but good concept,I purchased this litter box thinking it would be easy to be able to collect the refuse in the tray. It does work for the most part but you have to be careful rolling it over or you will make a mess. I eventually had to give it up because my cat had out grown it & decided not to get the larger model because it would make a bigger mess. If you have one small cat this will work well for you.
3,"rolling is tedious, but works","If you wait a long time to clean a litterbox, then I suppose this rolling idea would be worth the time and effort. However, I clean the box every morning, and I find it easier to just scoop manually. I guess I would be better off with a regular litter box with a hood, since I rarely- almost never- roll it. Also, when you roll it, litter sometimes will come through the seams between the base and the hood."
5,Can never go back to scooping by hand!!,"This litter box is a great concept and I'm so happy it delivers as advertised. It's so easy to just tilt it and sift all the litter into the drawer on the side, dump the drawer into a bag, add some fresh litter on top, and be done! So much faster and MUCH less smelly/gross. I do have a few critiques... the drawer bin doesn't snap in all that securely, so sometimes when I tilt the box it's open a crack and some litter spills onto the floor (I usually vacuum anyway so it's not a big deal). The top gets scratched up pretty quickly if you use the box on a hard floor (like tile), and I wish the box was offered in a slightly bigger size (keep in mind half of the inside is taken up by the pull out bin and sifting partition, so it's a bit cramped in there even for my medium-sized cat). But overall this box has worked out great and I certainly would buy another one again because I don't want to go back to scooping dirty litter out by hand!"
1,Stinky box,"This box does NOT CONTROL ODORS. Right after completely cleaning the box, it would smell again the minute a cat used it once. I have had cats for almost twenty years now and am always in search of a better cat box, this isn't it. The opening is so low that if you put a little extra litter inside, the cats would send the litter flying out of it when they bury. If you put the right amount of litter in the box, the cats can't cover their poo properly and the box always stinks. Also, extra litter in the box always dumps into the cleaning tray when you clean the box. After weeks of my house smelling like a barn, or having piles of litter and poo thrown on my floor, I've given up on this one, it's in the trash."
5,It works!,makes cleaning the litter box effortless and both of my cats actually prefer the omega paw box over their other hooded litter box. I guess I'll be purchasing another omega paw now.
2,Very Messy,"I was a little disapointed with this Litter Box, but I don't regret purchasing it because my frustrations with it was the push I needed to buy a Litter Robot (Which I LOVE!!!). Anyway, I found this litter box very messy. Everytime I rotated it upside down to ""filter"" the litter, a handful of litter would always pour through the crack between the bottom part of the litter box and the top part and get all over the floor. I didn't mind this at first because I was just happy I didn't have to scoop the litter, but after a while I found this very annoying and inconvenient. It was enough of a spill that I had to bring the vacuum out to clean it up. If they did a better job of ""sealing"" the unit so it wouldn't spill, I would probably give this box a 4-star rating instead."
2,Leaks. Too messy to use.,Seemed like a good idea for the price. But the product seemed to leak and the hinges didn't stay snapped all the time. On to plan B.
2,disappointed,"Be prepared to use more litter with this than a regular litter box. When the unit is rolled (to capture waste), the slide out trap, while collecting most (But not all), the soiled litter, also collects a good portion of unsoiled litter. Even after following the mfgs. directions exactly, I still find that I have to use a regular scoop to completely clean the box, It does control dust and odor, but all in all, this unit is pricey based on its performance. Better off with a (cheaper) covered litter-box and scoop in the regular fashion"
2,I REALLY wanted to like this!!!,"After reading the reviews and weighing the pros and cons, I plunked down 35 bucks and bought this. Unfortunately what this doesn't take into consideration is, to put it politely, the viscosity of the poo you are dealing with. Our kittens ended up getting diarrhea and this thing was a nightmare. Also, without a liner, I just felt that I wasn't able to keep it clean. The smell was awful. I finally trashed it and went with a good old fashioned basic pan. At least I could feel confident that there wasn't poo trapped somewhere in the box. Sorry, this just isn't the kind of box for a neat freak!"
2,"In theory, works great, but poor quality","I purchased this box a month ago and have found that when it stays together it works exactly as described - which would be a five star rating - however, as mentioned by another customer the tabs which hold the lid on and the sifting tray inside do not work properly. This means I roll it and the lid pops off; spilling litter everywhere...or the sifting tray slides around and more than just waste clumps end up in the pull-out drawer. To say this box has *increased* my time piddling around with the litter is an understatement. After purchase of this box I have spent more time sweeping up piles of used litter off the floor and around the box and reaching in and scooping what it improperly sifted. If this box were manufactured to stay together with ease then it would be fantastic. Unfortunately you risk getting a box that is poorly designed and could cause you to dump litter everywhere. I will be returning if possible and hope another box will be better."
3,litter box,"the design of this box is truly geniusit could have been made a little more sturdyit does sometimes leak litter outof the sides if the clips aren't tightbut, it is a great way to do a dirty joband i would buy one again"
1,"Easier in some ways, harder in other ways than conventional box","It's very cool to roll the box and just take out the pieces of clumping litter in the scooping tool. But after a while you realize that a lot of litter is stuck in the bottom of the box and you need to reach in and do a traditional scoop. However, it is very difficult to remove the lid with the flimsy plastic lid connectors that are almost impossible to use. So you try to reach in the hole to scoop out the litter, but that is very hard and very frustrating. The final straw was when the cats decided it was way easier to go poop just outside the box and scoop the litter out the hole to cover it. Big piles of poop and litter on the floor....made me decide to give up and get another ""Clever Cat"" litter box. Works great. No mess. But now I'm out $35 bucks. Hope I can find someone to give this to."
1,very disappointed,"I was so excited to get this litter box:I have 3 cats and hoped it would be easier than scooping. Was I ever wrong. The litter leaks out, the latches will not stay locked and I spend more time sweeping up litter than I did scooping. Wish I hadn't thrown the box away I would send it back tomorrow. I got it December 22, 2009."
3,Hard to clean when the litter sticks.,"The litter sometimes sticks and you have to remove the cover to scoop the rest. Also, the litter still follows the cat outside the litter box. I like the concept; it's good if you have something to stop the litter from following the cat out and the right litter that doesn't stick to the bottom."
4,NICE Size,"I love the size of this thing, as I have a rather gigantic cat.As far as rolling it, rather than scooping? I did for a while, but the set up for rolling it took away a bit of cat room from inside the box, and frankly, I find scooping easier.STILL, I love the set up, and would buy it again.It's heavy to ""roll"" so be aware of that, and make sure you have the sides closed securely. Mine was a little ""off"" and took some effort to ensure closure, but it worked.It's a nice set up, whichever way you decide to clean it."
5,love it,"great product easy to assemble, good directions and easy to use, no problems from the owner and cats seem to like it already."
3,Good concept but needs more work,"I was very excited to get one of these litter boxes. It is very quick and easy to clean. However, there isn't much room inside for the cat. Make sure you get a large size (I got the regular size...my cat isn't that big). My cat has kicked out poop 5 different times. Last night he kicked out a fresh pile and then stepped in it. He als kicks out a BUNCH of litter trying to cover it up. I think it is because there isn't much room inside for him and there isn't anything to sort of block the liter and poop like a regular litter box does.I am looking for a new one. Might try the igloo."
2,litter box,The long catch box does not catch all the litter clumps when you roll it over. Wet letter sticks to the screen at the bottom and does not go into the little box. The whole litter box is too big. It is hard to line up the top of the box with the bottom to latch the latches on the sides. I have a regular litter box with a top which is much easier to clean. I would not have bought this litter box if I had known this beforehand.
1,Horrible Idea!,"When you roll this device to ""clean"" it you're coating the entire litter box in pee gunk. My cat wouldn't go in and started going elsewhere when forced to use this, now I have to find a way to remedy that. This is a very bad invention..."
4,rolling cat litter box,"This really does work the way it advertises. It was really hard to close the top over the bottom but once accomplished, the box does roll easily. Best results when the cat litter is not too deep and roll slowly. You will hear the chunks hit but if you roll too far, you will also get some clean sand in the trap. Easy to pull out the trap handle and replace. You need some room to roll the box so if your bathroom is tight, try the laundry room."
3,"Great in theory, but...","as we all know cat's don't always do their business in the center of the box, and it sticks to the sides. When this happens with this litter box, the stuck part has to be dislodged manually before it will work as designed. Still, it is better than how I was doing it before and the 'girls' seem to like the privacy over an open litter box. Additionally the clips that hold the top and bottom together are very flimsy, they could have done a better job there for sure. Finally, there is an insert that is in effect the screen that separates the litter powder from the waste, and smaller pieces of waste matter will sometimes go through the screen but somehow get caught and not come back out necessitating removing the insert, which is not a problem other than it was not designed to be removed repetitively. I would have given it 4 stars had it not been for the two issues outlined above. Hope this helps"
5,Great Product,"I have a multiple cat household, and have had difficulty maintaining the cat litter boxes.I am really pleased with how easy this litter box is to clean, and dispose of the litter.I use a good quality clumping litter (Precious) and the cats love the system."
3,Manual scooping is still better,"For those who absolutely hate the scoop I am somewhat impressed with the design of this box. However, scooping is still superior for these reasons: 1. You get the pee clumps and poops out faster with the scoop, 2. You will waste less litter with the scoop (some clean litter will end up in this box's clean-out tray, 3. This box is much taller than a regular covered box, 4. You will need a fair amount of space where the box sits to roll it, 5. It is quite heavy to role when it is loaded with litter.If you don't mind the scoop don't get this box. Bottom line is this box is significantly more work than the scoop. I tried one for a week then returned it. Amazon's return policy/processing is top-notch."
2,Disappointing,Disappointing. Tabs did not hold so that when you turn it over all the litter falls out. Needs improvement before I would buy again.
2,Doesnt work,"This product just doesn't work. When you roll it, it simply scatters litter everywhere. Not bad as far as enclosed litterboxes go, but the item's main feature is a joke."
2,Too small,"Even the large size is too small for my 16 LB cat. That is all I have to say, but Amazon insists I use at least 20 words. God bless you and have a great day."
5,Love this litter box!,"I used to use the traditional open litter box in which you scoop, and hated the smell and shifting through the litter to find everything. This box is so easy and fast to use! I just roll it and everything will fall into the scoop, ready to be tossed. The faster process makes cleaning the litter box so much less painful and less smelly. After 4 months, one of the plastic tabs did break on me, but I just used rope through the hole and tie it up, and if I ever need to take off the top to fill up with more litter or clean the box, I just untie it. This litter box requires the clumping type of litter."
2,Ok when it isn't broken,"Tried this after reading all the rave reviews. Works pretty good until the plastic clips broke off. Now basically useless.I can see why some people like this when it works. I thought the one of the flaws was that there is no way to put plastic lining so clumps of pee would stick to the bottom, requiring frequent cleanings. Thats when my clips broke.I went with the tidy cat breeze and will never go back to these other types of litter boxes."
5,Handy dandy,Although it is a bit awkward having to tip and turn because of a lack of strength in my hands I really like not having to scoop the poop. Maybe an indentation on the bottom would help somehow. Cats took to it within a couple of days. I may just order another one since I have two cats and really want to get rid of the other regular litter box.
2,"Great idea, poor design","This product was easy to assemble and worked well for a few days. However, the weakest feature is the way the green top is fastened to the bottom. Sliding plastic tabs hold the two together but easily come loose. If you don't notice when they are loose, you wind up with litter leaking out of the box when it is rolled over for cleaning. Also, one of the tabs on my box broke off after only a few days. I would drill holes and insert bolts in the lip between the top and bottom to hold them together securely, but the design doesn't make it easy to do that."
3,"The good, the bad, and the messy","I received the litter box in a short time. Put it together and the first three times I used it, oh wow! It was wonderful. I loved it! But then...The front fastener came loose, and What a mess. Litter all over the floor. As of now I cannot get the fastener to work even though I have tried with adjustable wrenches,and plyers but so for I have resisted using the hammer. This is a great idea but it needs some work. As of now, I have to put a mat down ( a very large mat) to keep the litter under control. I think it still beats an open litter box if you can catch the litter (it is clean).Barbara"
5,The best litter box,This is the best litter box ever! I have 2 cats and it takes the pain out of cleaning the box. Thanks!
1,Absolute waste of $,"My husband bought this bulky, ungainly litter box after reading all the 5 star reviews- well, I clean the box, and I ABHOR it. First off, it needs SO much room to roll over and back. Secondly, the clumps need quite a bit of coaxing to get into the pan, which means I have to really get it moving, if you know what I mean! Third, some of the smaller clumps just get stuck in the grate and are quite difficult to remove. A word of advice, DON'T buy this product. A regular litter box works just as well, if not better, so much easier to access and clean all over."
4,made life easier,"I love this thing, We are trying to get pregnant and I was told to stop cleaning the litter box. My husband hated cleaning the old littler box so I still did it. Now he cleans it without complaining because it is so simple to use.My cat can now use the little box without our 2 dogs staring at her, so I think she likes it better too.We roll it all the way over, but a little still gets left in the box so it isn't really all the way clean, but it will do."
4,"I never write reviews, but this one is worth it!!","I have no experience with litter boxes - except that I know I would HATE getting in there and scooping. The boys had to have 2 kittens and I knew I would be taking care of them, so I tried this litter box. It is great!!! If you put it together correctly - screen in right way and ""drawer"" in all the way, it is very simple to use. Know you'll need to turn it upside down the the clean litter goes thru and the clumps collect in the drawer, and then a bit more right to spread the clean litter back, and you'll see for yourself it's SUPER!!! I keep little dog waste bags (so no holes like grocery bags) by the box to slide the nasty clumps and disgusting poo into and tie it up and boom!, I'm done!! Im going to order another, because they kittens are all over our house now!"
5,Omega Paw Self-Cleaning Litter Box,"I am very satisfied with my Omega Paw Self-Cleaning Litter Box. It is very easy to use and because of the scoop box, simplifies my being able to clean up after my 3 cats on a regular basis."
5,Omega Paw Self Cleaning litter box Size Large,"This litter box is awesome! No more messy cleanups. Easy to use. Comes with easy to understand instructions. Just tilt the box from side to side and all the waste is traped. All you have to do is pull out the handle with the dirty litter in it, place in trash, replace the handle scoop and you're done. No more messes in this house. Very pleased!"
5,Best litter box ever!,"I have tried just about every litter box out there. I was dubious about this one but the star rating convinced me to try it. SO easy to clean, nice and roomy and my VERY picky cat likes it just fine. I'm buying a second one today!"
2,"Good Idea, but not for me","I was really excited at first about this litterbox. But my cats don't like it. I have huge cats and one likes to stand really tall. Also it dosen't hold very much litter, so you do have to police it VERY frequently. (Espcially with more than one cat) My cats are also not used to any kind of covered litter box. I have no doubts though, that some people really like it. I think it would work better for small cats."
3,Kitty Litter Pan,"I purchased this litter pan in August ... it is now December 2010. The concept works well ... roll the pan onto it's top and all the waste is filtered and deposited into the tray then when you roll it back to it's upright position the clean litter is redistributed into the litter pan. The problem I encountered was when I took the top off to scoop small pieces of waste and add more litter. When I put the lid back on and pushed the clips that hold the top onto the bottom, one of the clips broke-third time unlucky. My husband has placed a clamp in the area where the clip broke so that when the litter pan is rolled onto it's top the litter stays in the litter pan. I do not recommend this litter pan. I'll be replacing it in the next couple of weeks for something more sturdy."
2,Misleading title,"For the asking price it seemed too good to be true, and unfortunately, but not to my surprise, my assumption was correct. The ""self cleaning"" aspect is more work than just scooping it out with a shovel (which I've been doing lately with this box anyway) and causes a LOT more of a mess. Save your money on this one. EIther go for the expensive ACTUAL self cleaning litter box, or go for the el-cheapo $10 one...because the latter will serve the same purpose as this one."
5,Bought this for the cat lover in my life and her cat loved it!,I bougbt this as a gift for a friend who is a cat lover and it was a huge hit! Her cat used it right away and seemed to like the design - she never went back to her old litter box! Apparently it is easy to clean and quite durable. Plus the price is right!
4,i like it but needs litter screen.,Cons:1) Needs a litter screen door. My cat likes to kick litter out of her box. A screen door would help.2) A little bit of litter does seep out through the seams.3) Doesn't clean the litter box thoroughly. Tiny bits of poop are still left behind.Pros:1) Beats the HELL out of scooping litter!!!!2) This product is a time saver.
2,Designed for small & medium size cats,"I loved the whole concept and idea of this litter box. And I ordered it hoping the size was as the description makes you think. MISTAKE! I have a large (18lb.)cat. When it came out of the box, it looked like something for kittens. The entry hole is hardly usuable by larger cats. And when I saw the actual space for the litter/area for them to go, there's no way. More than half of the interior is the rolling and catcher. The spot for them to do thier business is around the size of a small or normal litter box. If it was designed with more room for the cats it would be great. But if you have a med/large+ size kitty, it's more efficient to go get a large plastic underbed storage box. At least that gives our bigger kitties a comfy and roomy place to go."
1,Changed my mind........(old review) Getting my second one...works great,"Loved this box at first (see following) but after awhile it began to fall apart. When you roll it the top separates from the bottom and litter goes all over the floor and the inside comes apart and no longer separates the solids. I finally took the insides out and use the boxes as a regular covered liter box. Sigh. My quest for the perfect litter box continues..(old review) This box requires the least amount of work of any box I have bought. I have spent $100's on mechanical/electric boxes and they all stop working eventually but the Omega is economical and keeps working! My cats (four now) seem to like it and had no trouble adjusting to it. Cleaning is so easy! Just tip and pull out the drawer! You do have to make sure it has been put together correctly and ""locked"" or it will leak litter when turned.... I'm buying my second."
2,Not so great,"I honestly don't know why this gets such great reviews. As stated by others, it leaks litter all over the floor when you roll it. Then, if you don't do it every day, the litter clumps can get too big and then get jammed in the pull-out tray (maybe that is a result of the cheap scoopable stuff I used?) Also, it doesn't hold very much litter and the sliding latches that hold the box closed are cheap and jam easy.Back to scooping for me until I can justify a robot!"
1,This item is lousy,"I bought this item near the end of 2007 thinking it would save on litter and be easier to maintain- wrong! I wasted twice as much litter and have gone back to using the scoop to clean the litter box. This item is worthless, and I am very disappointed with it and the amount I had to pay for it."
2,Good While It Lasts,"The first one we got from Amazon was broken, replacement worked fine for about 3 months then one of the latches broke and it was useless. You try to tip it over and the clogs of you know what just spill out all over the place. Oh well, time to find something different, it's just too fragile."
2,"Even the Large is too small, Litter everywhere!","If anyone has a cat that really likes to scratch after using the litter box, don't get this. If your cat is large, don't get this.I was excited when I first bought it, untill I realized my cat was too big to comfortably go to the bathroom in it. Also the first time I went to roll the whole contraption over (that is how it cleans the litter) litter flew everywhere. I've had to take out all the special self cleaning parts on the inside just so my cat can fit, and it's more of a pain than any conventional scooping.If they included a door to keep the litter in and made it a bit bigger then I would consider buying again."
1,Works great...if you wish to create a beach....,"If you wish to create a beach, this product works great. It is far easier to buy litter that clumps, remove the cover (which confined the space and works well if you have a very small cat) and scoop out the clumps yourself. This device is terrific at scattering litter through the rolling action over a wider surface that the cat does alone. Surfs up!"
2,Boo for making this on the cheap! It used to be excellent.,"This is a fantastic idea. I bought one of these about 6 years ago, and it was the greatest litter box ever.Sadly, I bought a new one to replace it, and although the design is the same, the materials fail the design. I can only assume that the manufacturer cheapened their costs by using flimsy instead of rigid plastic. Unfortunately, cat litter and waste go all the place it's *not* supposed to now. It sneaks under the grill that used to catch it, and goes behind it where the clean litter should pass through, getting stuck unless you completely break down the box and reassemble. Then the rolling edge side gaps open and litter sifts down onto the floor.Unless they start making this out of rigid plastic again, instead of this flimsy flexy stuff, this product is currently a complete waste of time and money. Not to mention the frustration of the stink of hidden cat waste."
3,Still getting the hang of it,Doesn't really sift the extra litter very well. Does make an unpleasant litter box more bareable in a small home.
3,Omega paws elf cleaning litter box,"Supposed to be self cleaning. Good idea, fair execution. Internal screen doesn't work well. Solid matter gets caught behind it, doesn't get into scoop. Gets clogged up behind it. Box needs another clip on lid. When turning to sift out solids, it leaks small amount of litter, creating a mess on floor."
4,the bomb,"With three cats in my arsenal of cats this box works best for me. I have tried all kinds of boxes even the expensive motor driven kind. This works best. just roll and empty. One of my cats likes to pee on the inside wall of the box which killed the Littermaid, and hampered cleaning with the various other boxes I've owned. This box deals with it better because it is a MANUAL operated box. The cats cannot physically pee on the grate that seperates the clumps from the clean litter. Just roll it over daily and empty the container. Nothing is perfect, but this comes close. A bargain compared to the Littermaid and other ""high-tech"" boxes in terms of cost and maintenance. Finally someone applied physics to a cat box. Give that person a raise!"
5,My Kitties Love It,This is the best litter box in the whole world. No mechanical parts to worry about breaking. And my two cats love that it is clean more often because it is so easy to use. Just roll and dump. I love it. I tell all my cat loving friends to get one.
1,It was great while it lasted,"This worked wonderfully for the first month we had it. Then came the day when my husband tilted it, and the clasps holding the two sections together broke and spilled dirty litter all over the floor. We tried to fix it ourselves so that we could still use it, but were unsuccessful. I wish they would come out with a sturdier version. We are now back to our 5 dollar litter tray and mat. Definitely a waste of money for us."
2,Not quite self-cleaning,"The first time I used this I thought it worked pretty much as advertised. Unfortunately, that was the only time. I have now been using it for 3 weeks and it ""cleans itself"" every other day.My first issue is that when you roll it on to the top to fill the container with the waste litter spills out of the side. The next problem is that often there are still clumps on the bottom that are not coming off when you turn it over so you have to get a scoop to remove them by hand. After using this for only one week I had to take the top off and completely empty and clean everything as some smaller clumps get stuck in the screen that is supposed to filter out the clean litter.For the price you can spend half as much and do the same amount of work."
4,"Works pretty well, minor annoyances.","The Omega Paw litter box works pretty well, except for small solid waste and unclumpped liquid waste litter which makes it through the filter and stays in the litter box. This requires the all of the litter in the box (which is a whole standard jug of litter) to be changed out every week or two to avoid any bad smells."
4,"Great litter box, great price!","I read all the reviews for this and the electronic self cleaning litter boxes, and am very glad I chose the Omega Paw.I went to Pets Supplies Plus and Petsmart and was disappointed that neither store carries the box. I was hesitant to order it online without seeing exactly how it works. But I put my faith in my fellow amazon.com reviewers, and am glad that I did.When my husband saw the box, he said, it's so simple it's brilliant!"
2,Not a big fan.,"Bought this thinking that it would be easier for my daughter to complete her chore of cleaning the litter box daily, but we have found that the locks on the front and right side don't stay locked into place, and when we turn the box, litter spills out of the side every time. Additionally, the trap doesn't only catch waste, but also good, clean litter as well. The trap with the handle doesn't push all the way in and is a bit crooked, so the litter/wasted doesn't all make it into the trap and we have to repeat the cleaning process 2 or 3 times to get it all. I will likely try to exchange the box and see if mine was just defective."
2,not an effective solution,"This is not an effective litter box. After reading the positive reviews, I thought I would give this product a try. However, The mechanism is flawed: if there is sufficient litter in the box, there is no way to just get the clumps into the scoop without getting a significant amount of litter inside the scoop as well. Just get a cheap box, and change the litter every day."
3,Cumbersome,"I won't even factor this part in my review because it isn't a product problem, it's a finicky cat problem, but 2 of my 3 will not use this thing. They don't want a roof and they make that point daily by going about their business just outside the entrance to the box. Dang it.What I do factor into the review is that to get the ""stuff"" to fall into the nifty slide out drawer, you have to roll it all the way over onto its top. Then to get the litter to even out you have to roll it almost all the way back over to the other side. That said, I do like just pulling out the poop filled drawer and emptying it.It really isn't any easier than scooping. That would be ok because it's cool and neat and I like the drawer but since my cats don't like the roof, it now sits roofless. And I scoop it out every day. Oh well."
2,Easy to Clean... If Only the Cat Would Use It!,"I love how easy to clean this litter box was. I say was because we used it for about 2 weeks and our cats constantly pooped/peed just outside of the opening even though their bodies were inside the box. This litter box is just too small and our cats are about 8 lbs apiece. Don't be fooled by the product dimensions. Close to half of the interior space is taken by the grate and scoop. It's really a fantastic idea but to get a usable litter space and also allow for the grate/scoop, this box would be enormous."
4,Wow! What a difference!,"With 2 cats I have to scoop every day and it was getting real old and time consuming. This product is amazing. It is SO quick! I'm running out of the house, late for work, and I can ""scoop"" the box in a minute. It's nice and big, almost too big. So if you have small space this won't work. My only complaints are that the smaller ""bits"" fall thru the sifting grill requiring minor scooping to remove and sometimes litter comes out from the ""drawer"". Not alot comes out, so it's not too bad.Overall, this is the best money I've spent on my pets potty products. It's not perfect but damn well close!"
3,"Works well -- But, not ideal for me!","First of all -- this item works well. I like it, but I lowered the stars because of my experience with the product. It is easily a 4-5 star. My situation is a bit different. We have a bengal -- bengal cats have notoriously loose stools. Loose stools and this product do not get along all that well. Just ends up being a smelly mess when you try to ""self clean"" the box. I have given up and just taken the middle portion out and use a liner for now. Also - the regular size is not big. Our cat is 5 months old and 5 lbs - the regular sized box is quite small (take a standard litter box and half that for a good idea of size). I should have gone with a large. Other than that, it is a great idea - but just doesnt work for me!"
5,Best cat box ever!,This cat box is the best thing since sliced bread. The key to this is not to have too much cat litter in the box. If you have too much it will end up in the dump container because the holding tray for the good litter is full making the excess go into the clean out tray.
3,"Good, in theory","After watching the video of how this litter box worked, I was hooked and had to buy!In the end, it turns out to be easier to just scoop the litter normally. Even still, when I have to pick it upand bring it outside to change it, the front clip does not stay. The inside flap or vent is broken. It doesn'tstay together. May as well buy any litterbox with a lid..."
5,Best kitty litter box ever!!!!,"I hate scooping kitty litter but this thing makes it super easy and nearly smell free. Simply roll it, tap it, roll back, shake, and remove the tray."
4,It works well but but cheaply made,"I like the fact that the concept works well. If you have ever dealt with cat litter anything that softens the horror of it is welcomed. However, my only criticism is that the plastic box does not fit well; hard to close and always some litter spillage when you turn it over. Otherwise I would have rated it a 5 star product. I suppose that in an effort to cut down the mfg cost, quality may be sacrificed. I would gladly pay more money for a better made box."
2,Not all it's cracked up to be,The litter box latches were flimsy and the cat litter leaked out when the box was rolled. You also need a large area in which to roll the litter box and dust from the litter goes all over. Simply scooping the cat litter is much easier and less time consuming than rolling this litter box.
4,Does what it claims to do!,"As long as you turn the litter box SLOWLY onto its side it does exactly what it claims to do. No mess. Hurrah!Word of warning: DO NOT overfill the litter box or it will not be able to sift the litter. Also, the inside usable space is actually quite small. I am worried my two Siberian kittens will eventually outgrow the box, and I purchased a large. So, no matter what breed your cat is, I recommend the large. I can't imagine this litter box being any smaller."
3,it is ok!,i was expecting more control of the litter but it seems this issue is beyond control besides when i empty the litter still some times i need to scoop and a lot of the litter comes in the clomped ones in that scoop ...... the idea great but in reality it is not working perfectly and for the price it is expensive when u compare it to the function
3,Omega Self-Cleaning Cat Litter Box OK,"I definitely like that this is a bigger litter box than our last one -- we have 2 adult cats so needed something bigger -- the size inside is a bit deceiving because the filter inside takes up alot of space so while it looks bigger from the outside, I'm not sure the inside area is much bigger than our previous litter box.One thing that is annoying is that our cats seem to spray much more litter outside of the box with this one - I think because of the filter inside on the right hand side(which looks a bit strange), the cats stick to the far left & front of the box and when they are covering their business, spray the litter out the front -- I find myself sweeping much more...otherwise, it's definitely easier to clean so that is nice.Still looking for a box that is big and easier to clean though!"
5,Self Clean Litter Box,"This product meets my expectations once it was assembled, although I had some difficulty assembling it.It works very well for my 3 cat household."
5,LOVE IT!!!,I have been searching for a better cat box forever. This is purrrfect! Very roomy inside and super easy to clean. I can even get my kids to do it for a change! lol Great price too!
5,The Best,"I have owned most electric cat boxes, and NONE of them have compared to the simplicity and cleanliness of this box. I love it, my cats love it, and they are SOOOOO happy I no longer have the electric cat boxes around. This cat box just goes to show that simple is best and that if it aint broke don't fix it. Save your money on all those electric cat boxes (I have spent at least $1,000 on those to date) and just go with this one, it is is cheap and it works. Also, this cat box is awesome on odor control. The only regret I have is that I didn't stick with it from the beginning and tried all those electric ones, only to return to this $30 marvel."
5,This works great!,"Read all of the reviews, good and bad. Decided to try it and boy I'm I glad. This thing works great!! (They may have redesigned the clips, beacause they work fine)."
1,Do not recommend buyng this--doesn't work,"Don't buy this product--it doesn't work. when you roll it, the litter goes into the filter and comes back out. You have to tip it nearly half way over, to get debris into the drawer. I threw out the box and didn't return it. I am using it as a regular litter box and then place to put the filter area gets in the way of cleaning. I cleaned it recently and literally had to scrape crap off the slots for the filter with my fingernails--ick!!! Plus, it was extremely hard to figure out how to put it together."
5,Works better than expected!,I am So pleased with this product especially for the price paid. Works great for a two cat household and makes what was a messy job so much easier and neater.
1,Horrible!!!!!,"The concept is fine - it does get the poop in the tray BUT the lid doesn't quite fit right so every time you dump it, all of the litter spills out onto the floor. I'll be going back to the regular litter box and tossing this $30 in the trash."
3,Not that great,"It is just ok to me. You really have to roll it completely over to get it to work and I still had remains in the box so needed to use the scooper anyway. Then you have to roll it almost completely back the other way to get the litter to go back to its original spot. Good thing I looked the first time or the litter would have stayed on the other (wrong) side.I used clumping litter and I still had to scrape the pee litter off the bottom of the box. Thankfully I didn't throw away the scooper. Also when I rolled it to clean it out bits of litter fell out of the box (clean but still I had to vacuum it up)...quite the pain.Not sure if I will keep this as it doesn't seem worth the money. It ""works"" but I am still scraping. Yes...it is nice that the majority of the litter was cleaned and I could just toss it...but it is def not worth a 4 or 5 in my book."
4,Easy to Use and it Works!,"This litter box is great. It works just as it says it does and makes keeping the litter box clean so easy! We live in a small apartment and it has also helped mask the smells that our uncovered litter box allowed.It's a little expensive and VERY large, but it works very well. We are very glad we got it."
5,The best litter box,"If you need a better litter box for the kitties, the Omega Paw roll and clean is the one. You just roll it over to filter out the clumps and turds. Dump the contents of the drawer and you're all set. The litter in the box is clean and fresh, and it doesn't waste any litter. Since the box is deep and covered, Zeus doesn't fling any litter out of the box and onto the floor. The is the best litter box I've ever owned, and over the years, I've had every kind of litter box there is, including the expensive LitterMaid automatic litter box. The LitterMaid is fun to watch in action, but once the shine wears off, I just want something that is quick and tidy. Nothing beats the Omega Paw, and it's only 10% of the cost of the LitterMaid.Omega Paw Self-Cleaning Litter Box, Pewter"
5,love it,I have purchased three of these litter boxes they are really easy to keep clean. I use to have the open litter boxes and they had to be scooped as soon as the cat used it because of the smell with this one I clean it once a day. I have only good this to say about this item.
2,"""Self-Cleaning"" function difficult to use and ineffective","The pieces do not fit together snugly when assembled. The slide-out waste collection tray leaves gaps that litter falls from when rolling the box to clean. It is very heavy and awkward to roll and, although I tried to clean after first day of use, the wet litter stuck to the bottom of the box and did not fall into the collection tray. So I decided just to remove the lid and scoop the waste as I would for a normal covered box. However, the two pieces of the box do not fit together well, and after several times removing the top to clean the litter, the latches are virtually impossible to line up to get the lid firmly in place. I would not recommend this product and would instead buy another litter box like the second one that I have which has a hinged lid that you can lift up to clean without totally removing it."
3,Works exactly the way it should...,"My furbaby loves it (he actually lays in it sometimes when he DOESN'T need to go potty). It also works as advertised, which has been a very big help in comparison with the old traditional covered litter box.However, what makes me give this a 3 star rating are the plastic latches that hold the top and bottom together. They're very cheap and flimsy. IMO, they don't do a good job at holding the thing together, and occasionally slip while cleaning/sifting the litter. I fear that one of these days it might come apart and spill everywhere. The edges are wide enough that holes could be drilled, and bolts/nuts attached to hold it together better (in a similar way that some plastic pet carriers are put together). I think this would be a good future improvement to make to this product in order to make it better. I'll be making a trip to the hardware store soon!"
3,Not really self cleaning,"Overall it is a good litter box, where you don't have to dig around for litter clumps anymore like it's a treasure hunt; you just tilt the litter box to the right and sift out the litter, leaving the big clumps. After you clean, just tilt it back and you have cleaned the litter box!The only thing is, it's not really 'self-clean' like it is advertised. Maybe I am not using it correctly? In addition, it is not very easy to lock the lid and bottom in place (it just doesn't fit together perfectly) and also the 'filtering out' process still does not get the tiny poop specks out."
5,Omega Paw,This has got to be the best litter box I have ever had. It is easy and simple to use. I am disabled and this makes cleaning the litter box a breeze. It is so good my daughter wanted one for Christmas and she got it. I highly recommend it.
4,Works fairly well so far,"Seems like you need to rock it back a lot more to get the clean litter back into the bin, but otherwise it works pretty well. Bought a second one last week to replace one of the other old boxes (three cats = three boxes)."
1,Not worth the time,I purchased this based on many of the positive reviews...I have never written a review on an item...but I feel so strongly about this one! The item is not worth the mess. It works fine as long as your cat doesn't pee on the grate and the clump gets stuck...then you have to take it apart and get all of the stuck on litter out of the grate..when you tip it...litter gets stuck in the rim so that you have to take it apart to clean it or the grate doesn't fit properly. I spent more time taking this apart and wiping litter out of places that it shouldn't be. To me it is just not worth the hassle...and I followed all of the directions for you skeptics out there...tipped if forward and then back on its top. I clean the litter box constantly. Maybe if I did it once a week this wouldn't be such a hassle.
1,More work than a regular cat litter box,"As the other reviewers mention this is quite bulky, you need the entire bathroom to roll it around... aslo everytime i rolled it the connector on the side came unsnapped and there was litter and poop everywhere as it leaked out, these do not seal well to be rolling around"
2,CLIPS BREAK EASILY,"I bought this and absolutely loved it at first. However, within a month one of the clips broke and when I rolled the box I had litter all over. I contacted the Omega Paw people and was promised replacement clips. However, they never sent me any clips. I made numerous attempts to contact them, but I get nothing in response. I tried taping the area together which helped holding the top when rolling. But now I have another broken clip. I don't know why the clips are breaking as I roll it easily.The customer service for OMEGA PAW stinks.I wouldn't recommend spending the money for this box, strickly because of the customer service and a definite clip problem."
4,Better than the average litter box,"Pros:- Extremely easy to use without any mess- Maintains odor control very wellCons:- Plastic could be of better quality- Some chunks get stuck to the bottom (maybe coat the plastic with something for non-stick?)Overall, a good buy and I'm super glad I got it."
1,Not worth the money!,"This litter box sounds great in theory but it does not work good at all! My cats like to get into the collection drawer. When you roll it, it gets litter everywhere. Save your time and money and buy a real automatic scooping litter box or just scoop it yourself. I ended up just using the bottom of it. I'd use the top sometimes when we went out of town and needed a second litter box. My cats are outside cats now, so I only use it when we go out of town."
3,"Great as a covered box, not a self-cleaning one","I think the size and design are great, and it looks nice, for what it is, but I didn't find the ""self-cleaning"" label to be all that accurate or useful. The whole idea is to set up this grate inside, and the solids stay caught on one side, while the ""clean"" litter flows through the screen as you tip the box to the side. Great In theory but not in practice. I didn't really mind after the first few times of trying it and having it not work very well, bc my cats are using the box and its nice and big inside, especially when you take out the screen/grate thing they give you. It kept slipping out of place anyway, so the ""self-cleaning"" mechanism was more of a ""move the litter around"" mechanism. I just use it like a regular box and scoop every few days. (Shrug) for the money I didn't expect a true self-cleaning box. Those are way pricier."
1,What a mess!!!!!,"I am beyond disappointed. If everything is working to specifications you are still going to be disappointed as it will not clean the litter box 100% per cleaning. If you are used to cleaning a litter box with a scoop and going until you cannot find any more lumps or clumps then you will not be happy with this. When you turn the box to the right and put it on its side going almost to the point of flipping it over you still cannot get all the clumps in the special catch all box. So when it rolled back you will find clumps,lumps and litter stuck to the grate the the litter was to fall through. Add to that the litter dust that goes ""poof"" when you roll it back over."
4,Saves a Lot of Effort,"This litterbox really does make cleaning less of a chore for me. Combined with the Litter Locker II, cleaning the litter box has become much less arduous and more mundane. My only complaint is that I wish the litter tray and opening were larger - sometimes my cats leave some pretty big urine clumps."
2,Save your money,After reading all the rave reviews about this product I was hopeful that it was as good as it's reviews. The sifting mechanism takes up about 1/3 of the box. The latches are cheap and difficult to lock and unlock. I tried several different brands of litter and found that they all stuck to the bottom of the box requiring me to take it apart frequently. Litter spills out od the cracks as well. I eventually removed the sifting screen as it kept popping out and didn't function as stated anyway. I gave it 2 stars only because it's so large with the divider removed it's a better fit for a very large breed cat like my Siberian Forest cat. It's an interesting idea but it just doesn't work.
4,Good alternative for traditonal box,"I have been using this box for a few months now and think it's a good alternative for a tradtional box. It is way more convienent and easier to clean. Sometimes, the litter gets stuck in the front and you have to scoop a little. We have also cleaned ours out with soap and water two times because the inside gets a little messy. We do have two cats though. It is plently large for both of them (which I was worried about) and they had no problem adjusting to it. Overall, I would recommend this box!"
5,Love it!,"Very easy to use, make sure you have a hard clumping litter and that you take 30 seconds once a day to rotate it, then dump the clumps!You will still have cat litter on your floor from when they walk out, but it cut down majorily on how much cat litter was kicked out and cut down on the smell!And it looks nicer than a regular open litter box just sitting there."
5,Litter Box,This makes cleaning the litter box so easy that I can do it daily and the cat loves it. She used to go on the carpet when the litter box was even the slightest bit dirty. I bought a second one I love it so much.
5,Cat Survival Kit Necessity- check!,"I bought this because of the numerous positive reviews and due to hurting my wrist thus making it hard to scoop.It has exceeded my expectations. I DID have a bit of a problem with the tab fasteners, as some have mentioned; initially, it was user error as I missed one in the fastening during assembly. All I do now is check them each time before rolling and that prevents trouble- they stay once pushed in place while rolling but do seem to slide out of position easily between cleanings. I can work around that- beats scooping.A suggestion: I found it helpful to fill the scoop after emptying it with fresh litter thus approximately replacing what was removed.The cats use it regularly- so much so that I am ordering at least one more. This is a definite lifesaver in terms of cleanliness and ease of cleaning. Highly recommended."
4,Omega self cleaning cat box.,"This definitely needs a clay litter that clumps. The natural ones using corn,etc. don't work. When I used ""the World's best Cat Litter"" I had to take the lid off and hand scoop. I have 3 cats and this needs to be done everyday or the clumps are too big for the scooper. Overall, it is a nice gadget, when the goal is to have a litter box with a hood. I have this on my porch and I don't want peoples faces in the litter box, so it works well."
3,Good product under the right circumstances.,"This is a very good product... for some people. It wasn't for me because of a few reasons. First of all, the only spot to put my litter box is in a tight space, so every time I wanted to empty it I had to pull it out in order to roll it. This may not seem like a big deal but it did cause litter to scatter. Also, there's not a big enough area for the cat to do its business, so you can't go without cleaning for more than a day like you could with other boxes. But it was very easy to use, and I didn't have a problem with it being flimsy. This could be the right product for you have enough space and time to clean it."
1,Over-rated Junk,"Like a few others, I purchased this item based upon rave reviews posted on Amazon.com and found it to be worthless. The construction is quite flimsy and one of the tabs that secures the top and bottom together broke the first week. Litter scatters everywhere from the seams, and the functionality is not remotely close to what is advertised. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND this product!!!!!"
5,"Simple, easy, clean, no hassle...","Simply the best litter box out there! Don't spend hundreds on self cleaning boxes, and don't waste your time scooping out icky cat messes! Simply roll this baby on to it's right side, roll it back, pull the drawer out and empty it into a bag, then roll the box back to the left a bit to get all the clean litter back where it belongs. We've saved tons of money on litter, our two cats love it, I never smell any cat smell, and my gosh 30 seconds to clean it, IF THAT!"
4,NEEDS A LITTLE HELP,"I COULD USE A HANDLE ON TOP AND BOTTOM. I HAVE A LIMITED SPACE TO TURN THE LITTER BOX OVER. I HAVE TO SLIDE IT TO THE SIDE TO COMPLETE THE TURN, AND COULD USE A HANDLE OR INDENT ON BOTH TOP AND BOTTOM TO COMPLETE THE TURN.I WAS VERY IMPRESSED WITH THE REVIEWS I READ BEFORE PURCHASING, AND EVERYTHING I CONSIDERED BEFORE PURCHASING WAS TRUE, TO MY DELIGHT. MY CAT AND I ARE VERY HAPPY WITH IT."
5,So far so GREAT!,"As much as I love my two cats, I truly loath scopping the box. This Box has made life so much easier. While my husband and i debated who could get out of cleaning it in the past, now neither of us mind. Plus we went from two boxes to one. I HIGHLY recommend."
1,my initial thoughts are negative,"The litter box arrived as is, with a shipping label stuck to it, covering the instructions, no box. It arrived dirty .. it seems to be made of cheap plastic - the reviews were misleading . does not seems like it will last .. will write more after he uses it and i try to clean it .. so far ... i suggest buyer bewaremany months later , my cat hates it...i frequently have to roll it several times to get the waste out - dust flies everywhere.. have to toss this and get a new , covered box ,... save your money"
5,I will never go back to an ordinary litter box,I love this litterbox and I will recommend it to anyone! I use the large box for two cats and I never have to scoop the litter! If you don't need a large size I recommend the medium sized box because the lid is a bit more secure on the smaller size. On the large box sometimes litter falls out it when you roll it if the latches are totally secure.
4,Great Litter box for the money!!,"This is a great litter box for the money. Easy to use, does a good job. Make sure to have something to catch litter from around the opening as the cats exit. This thing is big so make sure you also have some space to roll it and get out all the unwanted bits."
3,"Great idea, poor construction","Fabulous idea, and works great UNTIL the clips break. They are very flimsy and once they break litter spills all over when I roll the box."
4,Roll n Clean litter box,I love the way it works. My problem was trying to get it together. itsplastic and I really had a hard time getting the locks into the slots.
4,Omega Self-cleaning litter box,"This is a great idea that could have been a fantastic idea. It is certainly easier to clean than any other litter box I have ever had. My cat used it immediately, which was a plus. However, when you flip it to move the clumps and fecal material into the tray, the tray scoop slides out if you don't hold it in place, which makes you feel like you need an extra hand and results in the debris ending up behind it instead of in it if you don't hold it in place. When you flip it, a small amount of loose litter leaks out from the edges onto the floor, requiring a sweep up even if the edge locks are securely in place. It's easy to assemble and all in all, a good purchase for the money. I would certainly recommend it to others."
4,Best You'll Find for Under $100,"I will say that of all the litter boxes I've owned, this is the easiest to clean. It's not 100% foolproof, though. Some of the litter clumps stick to the bottom of the box, and therefore don't get transferred to the removal bin. Honestly, though, dealing with that is still a step up from the kinds of disgusting situations I've found myself in when trying to clean my previous litter boxes. Overall I'd say it's a good buy."
1,"Great in theory, not so good in reality","Was really excited about this product at first, but it doesn't work very well. Some ""treasures"" were left behind in the box and others would get stuck in the grate without going into the tray. Litter would also spill on the floor during the turning process."
5,I love this litter box,"I absolutely love this litter box. I have two cats and I no longer have to scoop all the time. I simply roll this litter box over and the waste drops into a tray that I just pull out and empty in the trash. I don't have to deal with the dusty litter on a daily basis, like I used to. I am recommending this to all cat owners that I know. In fact, I am probably going to order an extra one in case anything ever happens to this one."
4,Cleaner,I like this litter box. The dust stays inside and so does the litter. It is all together better than others I've had.
2,"Concept good, but not worth it",It does pick up some of the 'clumps' but does not keep it as clean as when you do it yourself. It is also pretty big and not really attractive.
5,Best litterbox ever.,Turns a long filthy daily ordeal into a brief filthy daily ordeal.I'll buy another if this one gives out. Love it.
5,"Easy, easy, easy!!!",I have owned multiple cats for over 15 years. I have tried EVERY type of litter box on the market. Automatic mechanical litter scoopers were horrible! I had resorted to plain old uncovered litter boxes until now. I don't have to SCOOP!! This is so much cleaner and more sanitary than any litter box I've ever had. I would recommend it to any cat owner who wants a simpler life!
3,omega,"I like this idea, however, I couldn't get the lid to fit down all the way, so everytime you do the flip litter comes out one side. You need to use clumping litter also."
5,Love,"The litter box is awesome - it's a ""must have"" especially if you have multiple cats.. The hood keeps the smell in for the most part, and it gets every last clump out of there with every dump.. Only complaint is that one of the sides isn't a perfect fit (however, with my luck, it's probably just this ONE box that ended up having that ""faulty side"").. When I dump it, it leaks a bit, so I have to clean that up every time - other than that, it's great.. It's a money saver as well, because I have found myself needing new litter less often, so - in the long run, it will be paying for itself!!"
5,Great Product,"Wish I hadn't wasted my money on two of the ""automatic"" litter boxes, nither of them lasted a year. This is sooo simple to use and works great!!"
2,Okay,"This box is good for making my cats enter and exit from one place so there isn't kitty litter everywhere, and it gives them some privacy - not that they care, but I do, but I just got so sick of rolling this thing over because it isn't the lightest thing, it doesn't catch everything so that means I have to keep rolling until it does and that's tiring, and the litter sometimes seeps out of the side, which is never fun. It's easier to just scoop the litter out with the shovel and call it a day."
3,Works as good as claimed!,"Very happy with how this works. Yes, it is cheap construction, but the results are very impressive. I can't imagine going back to a regular litter box again.We've been using this for over 4 weeks so far.Update: January 2011 - we ended up going to regular litter boxes about 4 months ago. If we only had 1 cat, this box would of been great, but it seemed too small for two cats to share as our second cat started to refuse to use it. It also was tedious to clean. Changed to 3 stars because of this. If we go to 1 cat again, then we may purchase it again."
5,It works!!,"I love it! I can't beleive it really works! Its this easy to have a clean litter box. Yes, maybe a little litter falls out of the crack when you roll it but that is nothing compared to the normal mess of cleaning a litter box. I would recommend this to anyone with a cat!"
4,Best litter box ever,"When our old smelly littermaid broke, I resigned myself to shelling out over $100 for a new one, but ran across the Omega Paw while searching for other options. We love this litterbox. No scooping, just removing the tray and dumping the dirty litter is a breeze. My only criticism is that we seem to have sand all over the floor from when our cats exit the box, however I put an old towel under the box to catch the litter from their feet and the problem has diminished significantly. A great product at a fantastic price with very quick shipping from Amazon. I highly recommend it."
3,I liked the idea but it didn't work for me,"I read the reviews and most of them were really positive. It just didn't work for me. At least it's good to have because I can put the top on when people visit us. I also like the deepness of the pan. It's still new to me, maybe in time I'll be able to have it work like the instructions say and get good results. Ask me again later."
3,meh,"i guess the product does what it says. but it lost the novelty after a while. we changed litter types, and the stuff we got didn't really go through the vent thingy. at this point we actually removed the top for convenience and we just have an old-school scoop. we're saving up for a litter robot maybe..."
4,Great litter box,This is a really great litter box but I have two cats so it's too small for them both. My daughter is using it for her one and loves it! So easy to keep clean! But I wouldn't recommend it for multiple cats unless you get a much larger one.
5,Perfect solution for our two cats,"I have two cats that both use the litter box a lot and demand it be sparkling clean every time. The Omega Paw is easy to use, controls odors, and saves me money because I end up throwing away only the waste and not a lot f extra litter."
1,"Poor quality, very easy to broken","I bought this litter box after I read all the reviews on amazon. After I received this item, it didn't work properly. This box is made of poor quality of plastics. The most important part is the lock for the upper and lower part, however, is very easy to broken.Only after 2 weeks, this part was totally broken. And I have to order a scoop again to clean the litter by myself."
4,Works well. Just a bit messy from tracking.,"This works well, must be kept FULL of litter or it doesn't work. My cat tracks the litter out of he box, never did on any other so I blame the box."
4,Omega Paw Self-cleaning cat litter box,"I have had many cat litter boxes in the past and so far this one is more functional. It's easy to handle, especially when I am running out of the door. Just tilt and listen to the clumps make their way into the researve container. great."
5,"easy clean, fair price",Never have to touch kitty used litter again. Got this for my daughter with 2 cats. just roll it every day or more if you have several cats. Never need to take it apart or clean it. The action of rolling it allows the dry litter to scrub the inside. I have one that is several years old - had to put a piece of duct tape on the seam to keep a few grains of dry litter from dripping out. Still better litter box for the price than anything else available. The attachment between the top and bottom should be improved - until then a little Handyman's Secret Weapon and you are good to go. Try a few kinds of litter to get the one you like. I am using the Aldi kitty litter. The texture works well and it is cheap.
2,Good idea but failed execution,Maybe it's just my luck but the lead doesn't close correctly. Every time I turned it over to filter the clamped pieces some of the litter gets through. Great idea though.
2,Neat idea that does not work in practice,"It is possible that it may work for some cats.The mechanics of rolling this box to collect the clamped waste are actually quite clever.However, if your cats insist on using it near the edges, the waste will cling to the box itself and stay there no matter how much you roll the litter box. Then you are back to cleaning it the old fashioned way, except that 1/3rd of the box is wasted and this box isn't particularly convenient to open for daily scooping."
3,"Great idea, not a great implementation","Rolling the box back and forth to collect clumps in the handheld tray is a great idea, but the rest of the design could use some work.The biggest problem is the mechanism to secure the top and bottom halves together. Twice the plastic clips have broken off from weight being pushed back and forth all the time. The grooves between the two halves also quickly collect litter until they no longer fit securely. The result is more and more litter leaking out of the edges. Some solutions might be stronger clips, more clips, and/or rubber gaskets between the halves. A tight fit would make this thing perfect. After buying a new box or taking one apart for a thorough cleaning, we run packaging tape all the way around to hold it together more tightly, which helps a lot.Unfortunately they haven't updated the design in a while, and we're on our third or fourth box after the previous ones have broken in various ways."
4,Litter Cleaning made Breezy,"Although technically not 'self-cleaning' (Oh How I Wish ...) this litter box does make scooping-poop a breeze. In fact, you don't have to scoop at all! All you do is 1/2 fill the box with litter (avoid wheat clumping unless you want a goopy mess)wait for kitty to poop and pee and roll box over 2 turns. All the ""mess"" (literally) fills the drawer cavity. Then slide drawer out and ""dump"" (no pun intended). Now that's innovation."
5,Incredible!!!,"Pushin' 70 granny with a bum right hand, and using this litter box is incredibly easy. I can finally clean and maintain my 2-cat litter box without help. I bought the larger size, and my cats loved it the minute it was installed in place of their smelly old standard scooper model. I've been using the Special Kitty brand litter from Wal-Mart and it works fine, so expensive litter does not seem to be necessary, although some fussy cats may disagree."
2,"Worked like a charm, and then...","If you had asked me what I thought of this box the first few weeks that I had it I would have sung you a song about how it is the best box that was ever created. However, after 2 months of use that is no longer the case. While my kitties love it, it has become an absolutely useless box in the ""rolling"" to clean capacity. The two problems that have caused us stop using this box are as follows, litter leaks out of the seams when it is rolled (which was not a problem in the beginning), and the plastic grate used to sift the dirty from the clean litter will not stay clipped to the bottom so there is no separation of dirty from clean litter. It was lovely while it lasted, but it should have lasted a whole lot longer."
3,"Great, but no miracle","After having this box for almost a year now, I can say I still like it, but it's no miracle.The cat still kicks sand out of it.We still have to open it up and wash everything inside every few months.I don't know if there's a better clumping litter to use...maybe."
5,Excellent litter box,"I just purchased one of these as a gift for a friend who's getting a cat. I have two of these myself, and love them. They're so easy to clean, I don't have to crouch down and sift around a whole bunch of litter to try to get all the stray bits, I just roll it over and dump the tray.When I bought these for myself, I had been tempted to get one of those self-cleaning ones. Unfortunately those are all over $100, and this one is ~$30. Honestly I doubt the automatic ones are really any easier than this one, and this one is far more affordable. Highly recommended."
5,Omega Litter Box,"I always read the reviews before purchasing an item 2 make sure that is worth my money. I have 2 say the Omega litter box works exactly how it says it works & I am very pleased. At first I was gonna go with a automatic litter box but I have been reading & hearing alot of negative comments about them & how they r expensive 2 maintain & they break down after a long period of time. My bf's cat loves it & sometimes he just likes 2 lay in there, I would definately recommend the omega litter box 2 anyone who has a cat."
4,best of class,best of class but needs bit of improvement. I read several reviews before purchase and they were largely right on. Design excellent but execution cheesy. Namely the four tab locks are too light and do not fit well. The tab locks can be improved by scraping excess plastic from the surrounding surfaces for a more secure fit. The makers should consider a higher end model with metal tabs and be more easily serviced. Also be sure and read the screen insert as to which side goes up. That was not clear or emphasized so my initial roll over was pretty messy until noted this instruction.
2,Never gets clean enough,"We got this box a few months ago. We had big hopes for it, but quickly noticed that the clumped litter often stuck to the bottom and sides of the box, so just turning over the box never got the litter clean enough. Also, when completely cleaning out the box (discarding all used liter, washing the plastic) it is such a pain to get around all the crannies. Using a simple box and scoop is more effective for us. I like the covered design, but the side compartment (to filter the litter after turning the box over) is too much unused space for our small bathroom. Will be looking for a simpler covered litter box."
5,AMAZING AND CHEAP!,"I ordered this a couple weeks ago from amazon, it came super fast and set up was really easy! I waited two days and then today went to empty it; I just rolled it over, shook it a little, set it right side up and la-te-dah all the clumps were in the pullout drawer- I just pulled it out and emptied it! It was so EASY and CLEAN! The only small thing I noticed is that it is pretty big so you have to have room to roll it. Also the things that keep the lid on dont stick very well if it gets litter in- we solved this by drilling holes and zip tying it closed. Such a simple design but works like a dream! Will def recommend to many!"
4,Beats the Litter Robot,I agree with most of comments made about the not so great quality of construction and the non-existent directions. This litter box is the best available option for people who do not want to scoop out litter by hand every day. I would like to add that you should not use more than 2 inches of litter in the box because the excess will overflow into the waste container and you will have to filter it out to save it.
4,"Great litterbox, but don't expect it to remove all the clumps!","We just recently adopted 2 cats from the humane society and decided to order these for the cats. We obtained the large ones and certainly they are HUGE litterboxes. The ease of use was better than I expected and it really is just roll and roll back then empty.There is a downfall in that the filter that is put into the litterbox has slits that are fairly large so if you have litter which ends up being in smaller clumps it will go right through the filter. This means that you won't really get completely clean sifted litter but ""relatively"" clean litter. You are still going to have to sift through the litter to get every piece out.Not a horrible weakness but it's the reason why I only gave this litterbox a 4 out of 5. I would certainly recommend this product over the littermaid devices however."
1,eww...,"hasn't anyone seen the episode of My Cat From Hell?! this litter box was serious criticized by cat behaviorist Jackson Galaxy. who (cat or otherwise) wants to be surrounded by their pee from top to bottom and side to side a few times daily?! personally, I think this is a disgusting idea. I wonder where all the 5 stars came from![...]"
2,Not what expected.,"Not what expected at all. Requires a large area for tilting and even after providing this it doesn't do what it says. I never got the clumps to collect in the removable tray. Very disappointing, I ended up using it as regular litter box with a cover."
1,Absolutely the pits!,I only used this for a few days. Was trying to make it easier on my roommate while I was on vacation. The cats shunned it because it was way too small for them. The unit does not work as advertised. It spills easily making constant huge messes and does not filter waste as advertised. Don't waste your time and hard-earned money. Amazon should not have anything to do with this terrible product.
2,TOO BULKY,"ACTUALLY ENDED UP SENDING IT BACK, WOULDN'T FIT IN MY SPACE. I'M SURE THIS HAS A GOOD USE, JUST NOT FOR ME."
2,Product misrepresentation,"This was supposed to be a large litter box, but when I received it today, it definitely is not the large. Will be returning and ordering for less on PETCO site. Very disappointed... Please correct the listing ASAP!"
1,No so self cleaning.,"The box arrived promptly. The instructions were not clear to me. The box did not clean, and once I took it completely apart, it would not go back together. It is now outside as a protection against the weather"
2,Cheaply Made,This item came to me shipped with the box open and packed horribly and the item looked used and appears it will break any minute. Everything about this item I ordered was terrible. Amazon needs to package their items more securely. Very dissatisfied.
2,Wrong color,I asked for a pink one and they sent me the wrong color. Now ill have to send it back to get the right color.:(
2,Not worth the trouble,"Although the concept is great, I think this design worked better on the drawing board than in actuality. I had trouble with litter getting caught and clumping in the plastic grid thing and having the waste not being capture in the drawer like it was supposed to. I also had problems with litter sticking to the bottom of the box and not going into the drawer like it was supposed to. This box requires a lot of floor space in order to make it roll which I found inconvenient. Because of the sticking and clumping litter issues I had to disassemble this box several times a day (I have three cats) and clean the box which I know this box was not designed for that. It was designed to eliminated all the extra work in having a litter box, but this box actually created more work for me. So I ditched it and went back to an old fashioned litter box."
3,They are a bit unwieldy but otherwise great,"They are large and cumbersome and require a great deal of room. However they do work great and are helpful with families who have multiple cats. I have had mine over two years now and they have not broken or fallen apart. If you have only one cat or a very small space to live in I think there are smaller and more efficient units out there that would best suit your purpose. But if you are a diehard cat lover who has two or three cats and a large house, this will work for you.No rakes to clean. or mechanical problems to deal with..."
5,Look No Further,No Costly automatic contraption. Works every time! Just follow the directions and take your time! I LoveIt!!!! And so does Kitty!!!
1,My cat hated this litter box and so did I!,"Ugh! This was not a good experience for me or my cat. My cat hated this litter box (it was just too small for her) and it was an absolute mess to clean. The internal sifter was just a huge pain in the butt to get clean and little bits of dried urine and poo would stick to the sifter. I was so disgusted with this box that I just threw it in the garbage. I was too upset to even return it. I just wanted it out of my house. I got a better one (through Amazon, of course!) and my cat loves it. (See my review of theX-Large Deluxe Hooded Litter Box (Colors May Vary)- now THAT'S a great litter box.)"
4,Pretty ok,I like it. My cat likes it. I get kind of annoyed by the amount of clean litter that gets wasted though. My friends are all jealous... Or they would be if I had friends. I just got my cat. Skeeter.
1,"""Supposed"" self cleaning litter box!","I was lead to believe this was a ""Self Cleaning"" litter box. I mean come on... I was searching for the hook up to the toilet REAL self cleaning litter box. Could not locate it. What we received was a completely manual way of trapping stank in your home for an EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME. I was lead to believe batteries, at minimum, filtered the waste. Nope, roll the achward shaped turd bucket clock wize and trape SOME waste in a slide out poop/pee mess maker. Litter everywhere,worthless, waste of money!!!"
1,bad:do NOT get,the pump doesn't reach the bottom so you don't get full use of water in tank. There is a hole in the back where the wire goes through. The prob w/this is that you don't know till its too late that you have over filled. Cheaply made. A waste of money but looks pretty far away.
1,Enclosed Cat Litter Boxes are Dangerous!,"Have you put your cat's litter in an enclosed pan so that the dust from the litter doesn't get all over the space where you've put the pan?Question: Where do you think all that DUST goes when it's enclosed in a pan, and the cat is digging around it it? Don't you think that the cat is breathing it? If your cat begins to have breathing problems - consider that lung damage has already happened and his/her lungs are clogged up with the litter dust.My black cat made me wake up to this problem. One day I saw him leaving the enclosed pan, and his black fur was all covered with white dust. That day was the last day my litter pan was covered - hope you reconsider buying an enclosed litter pan for the sake of your cat's health, and your wallet when you have to visit the vet because he/she is coughing, and can't breathe.P.S. I've yet to find a good cat litter that is 100% dust free.gh"
2,Does not meet expectations,"It is difficult to keep the ""pins"" in place so when turning the box the litter dumps out. I use it now as just a covered litter box and scoop like the regular ones."
3,"Could be way better, but it's still better than an ordinary pan","There are two major problems with my unit. 1. When tipping the litter pan upside down, litter escapes out the side. Not a lot, but they could seal the side better. 2. When tipping the litter pan, the filter inside sometimes becomes dislodged, which means unhooking the lid, repositioning the filter, and then rehooking the lid. It's annoying."
1,Horrible manufacturing,"Bought 2: both defective: clips don't seal completely, so when you turn it over, the litter goes all over the floor."
1,USED LITTERBOX!!,"When I was assembling the litter box, I noticed a splatter on the back wall and it smelled like litter had already been in it. The splatter was poop!!! I looked closely and there were also scratch marks. Litter box came used!"
3,Self-Cleaning - not,"I brought two of them and was very excited for my three cats. The product does not work as shown in the video I watched. The screen does not stay in place and the latches do not fasten as they should in the front and litter pours out as you turn the box onto its side. However, my cats like the box, I just flip the lid up twice a day and scoop. The box is very large and hard to handle for a small woman. I am very disappointed.This is no relection on Amazon.com - I've alway been happy with them."
3,Love this!,"This litter box is awesome! All I have to do is clean it out in the morning and its good to go! I wish I would have bought the bigger one though. It seems kind of small.Edit: I am changing the rating of this product. After a month my cats did not enjoy this box. It does not self clean good enough, and its a tiny area so if I forget to clean it out less than twice a day, I have kitty roca hidden throughout my house. I ended up taking the top off and using the whole box, which IS big enough. Scooping takes maybe like...2 more minutes. Big deal right? I will still give it 3 stars, because it is just an ""Ok"" litter box."
2,"""Self Cleaning"" not entirely accurate","My wife bought one of these several years ago. I doubted the 'self cleaning' claim especially at the price. Admittedly, it can collect some of the solid waste for quick easy removal. However, smaller pieces still get caught & must be dealt with the old fashioned way - with a scoop and persistent attention to the task.Reviewer Qualifications: 32 years experience cleaning up after my feline friends who possessed numerous varied & creative skills for messing in & out of litter boxes!"
1,Just doesn't work long!,"The box worked well for about a month then I started having problems. When I rolled the box much of the clean litter was being caught in the scoop. I thought maybe I had added to much litter so I took some out, with less litter everything was sticking to the sides and bottom of the box. Also when I rolled the box litter would come out at the seam where the top and bottom join. It turned out to be less work to just scoop than to deal with all this. I was very disappointed because of all the good reviews for this litter box. If you think just as I did that this box is the answer to all the scooping I'm afraid you'll find just as I did it doesn't work that well."
1,Got two - Wasted $60,"Based on the high ratings this product received we invested in two of these. It has been less than two months now and both are inoperable. The latches fail to close properly after a short period of use and every time we roll the box litter pours out the back. This is NOT what you want.. absolutely disgusting! So needless to say these two relatively expensive litter boxes are on their way to the trash, and we're going back to scooping. Don't waste your money!!"
1,Good idea but not quite there,"I have three cats so thought this would be an easy way to scoop litter. I found that there is more effort cleaning up the litter that comes out when you roll the box than actually scooping the litter. If any litter sticks to the sides, you need to reach in and break it free. It takes a large amount of space to roll the box so plan accordingly. I have gone back to my regular litter boxes since this one is not ready for prime time....."
4,Slick design,"I've had the unit for several months now, I was considering the litter robot at about $300, which I may end up doing, but this works well enough. I bought the large and I have two cats about 6 lbs. One for some reason NEEDS to jump in the box while the other is doing its `doodies', so it's big enough.As for light construction, what are all these people complaining about. The tabs on the side are resilient enough to last if you don't force them. When putting the lid back on, gently move the tabs back the open position before trying to force it to lock, and use just enough force to slide it to the rear (open), if you don't know which way is to the rear, again don't use excessive force in the wrong direction or you will break'em, DUHHH. My cat took to it very fast. They like the privacy.For $40 it a great buy, you almost can't go wrong with it. I will buy the $300 litter robot....just as soon as I win the lotto."
1,"gone, gone, gone","i was hoping that this litter box would deliver me from litter box hell...i think it infact sent me further into it's depths. i have never once smelled ""cat"" or have been told that my apartment smells of ""cat""...since owning and using this litter box i, myself, notice that my apartment smells of ""cat"". this product worked well at first but as others have claimed it began to fail and never avenged it's self. do not waste your time with this product unless you enjoy frustration and disappointment."
5,This is a great product,"Omega Paw RA20 Self-Cleaning Litter Box, Large, Green and BeigeI really like this product. I've only had it for one month, but it sure beats scooping. Ordered on 12/10 shipped in 12/11, received on 12/14. Can't beat that. Easy to put together. I find as I turn it over to move the clumps to the drawer, if I pound the bottom with my open hand, the clumps, for the most part. are released from the bottom into the drawer. It takes several whacks but that's no problem. I got the larger box for two cats and both took to the box with no problem. I recommended to a friend and she ordered one this week of the smaller size. Hope she's as satisfied a customer as I am."
5,This thing is AWESOME,"We have a diabetic tabby who urinates a LOT and have used Littermaids and also the Scoop Away crystals automatic litter boxes, and this is by far better than both of them. I gave my mother a Littermaid and now she wants one of these ! The only negative is that the seam on the rounded end is not very well-sealed and has a tendency to leak litter when you roll it. If you have a cat that pees a lot or multiple cats this is your solution."
3,A Clever Idea; Poor Workmanship,"This is very clever in its simplicity but the quality is of the product is not very good. The latches are the big issue in my book. They are very cheap. They should be some sort of clamp considering you have to turn this thing upside down. I have had a couple of spills where the top was not secured well by the latches. Very aggravating.The opening for the poop tray looks like it was cut by hand with a hack saw. Not a very polished look.Overall, I think it does a good job. However, I think the manufacturer should rethink the latch issue."
3,BEWARE!,"We love this litter box for the ease of it. Some things to be aware of is, that it needs to be emptied at least every day or the clumps will stick to the box. The kind of litter you use is also important. Worlds Best has worked better for us. (We have a himalayan.) Also this company does not support its' product. We have e-mailed them 2x( to no avail)-asking how to buy more clips. Once one breaks, the litter will spill out making a mess & the system doesn't work. It was a year before one of ours' broke."
1,NOT The Solution!,"I bought this based on the positive reviews, but the negative reviews reflect my experience after trying it. I especially wanted to reduce the amount of litter outside the box, thinking that the large cover would help. What happened is that, as others have mentioned, the clasps holding the top on failed to work after the first few uses, and litter leaked onto the floor whenever I rolled the box over. The result was a lot MORE litter on the floor. I was thinking about returning the product, but have instead been using it with just the cover (without the filter or scooper with the handle). It works OK as a regular cat box, though takes more floor space than a regular box and was much more expensive. Overall, I'm sorry I made this purchase."
2,You get what you paid for,"I know this item is cheap and beware, that's exactly what the product is. I used it one time to cut out ornaments from Crayola Model Magic and it's so bent and twisted, it doesn't hardly look like a snowflake any more. It easily bends and ends up misshapen soon after using."
2,used for ear stretching,"I like the fact that P.T.F.E tape is non-adhesive, but its so dang hard to work with. It crinkles SO easily, and doesn't really bond to my plugs. I think bondage tape is a better use. Sorry if you were looking for a review about plumbing..."
5,Great Band!!!,I came across the band Lucero by accident recently and now I am upset that I didn't know about them years ago!!! Ben Nichols is a great writer and Lucero as a whole is a great band. Tennessee in my opinion is one of their better albums with a good mix of some slower songs and up tempo songs as well. I have yet to listen to one Lucero album and not want to play it again and again. Love this band!!!
2,Not their best work.,"Lucero is one of my favorite bands, but if you've never heard them, don't buy this CD first. If you lean more toward the rock side on a rock-country scale, get ""that much further west"" and if you lean more toward the country side, get the self titled CD. S/T is one of my favorites of all time, but this one is produced weirdly and it dillutes the rawness of soul of nichol's voice and the music in general."
1,blurry photos,"the book offers very basics, if you have been doing doll customizations, then, you probably have already picked these tricks & tips along the way. The photos in the book are so out of focus, they all look blurry, I cant even see one sharp photo in the entire book. it is a shame since its a digital era"
2,More of the same...,This one has more tips in it than any of the others but it really doesnt TEACH anything! I feel as though I am eavesdropping on artists' conversations with this format and sometimes personal ones at that!(Catty!) Nor do I want to look at pictures! I bought this book because I wanted to learn! Sorry but if another fashion doll makeover book comes out I wont be buying.
2,Didn't justify my expectations,"This case didn't justify my expectations because first of all it looks cheap and built cheap (when you close it frames look a little asymmetric). My case is black so if you drop it by occasion it will have scratches. Another thing that I didn't like at all is that you can't use your cradle while your Dell is in the case. Also it doesn't work in my car's mount. It means that you have to pull your Dell out all the time (when you do it too often, fastenings on the case loosen). I wouldn't buy one like this anymore for this price. If it cost me $5, I would think..."
4,One of a kind,"There are very few options left for lamps that take lantern batteries. These were about the only ones I found, and while I can't estimate battery life yet, they work fine."
2,money ill spent,"Many years ago, Sony and John Williams collaborated on an album of Star Wars favorites. I suspect someone at Telarc thought the same magic would work with Jerry Goldsmith and the LSO. Alas.While the pieces chosen show a good cross-section of Goldsmith's crativity, the execution is seriously lifeless. It is as if the compositions were left to saute' overnight in Symphony Sauce: the performances are plodding and pedestrian. I don't know who convinced Goldsmith to do it this way, but omitting the martial snare roll at the beginning of the Man from U.N.C.L.E. theme, or not adding at least an accordian to the Waltons theme, are just two examples of how Goldsmith's great work has been emasculated by, I suspect, some record exec's insight. If you want to hear these pieces as originally written and performed, you'll have to start searching on other albums. Good hunting, and let us know what you find."
5,Latin is worth knowing,"This is a great way to introduce Latin. My 13 year old grandson is very much interested in learning the material via the stories of the family. He is home-schooled by me. Of course, it should be presented with at least some explanation of what else was going on in the Roman Empire in A.D. 80. The great fire of Rome took place in A.D. 64, leading to the subsequent persecution of Christians by Emperor Nero and others.I highly recommend this book. If the rest of the series is as good as this one, my grandson (and I) will learn much. Latin really can be fun to study."
1,Book Stands Alone!,"This is an excellent book. Puts fun into learning Latin, perfect for grammar age students. The companion Student workbook is available but not needed. I find this book to have plenty of exercises to compliment each lesson. A must have for young Latin learners!"
2,Panasonic RCCD350,"First,very poor sound.Had old GE that had better sound. SecondHard to set up and use. Cd player skips on all cd,s. There arebetter ones to pick from. boston for one"
2,This radio must have been designed by an insomniac,This clock radio should never have been created. It stinks. The sound quality and reception is passable but the bright blue illumination on the display is intolerable. The alarm setting process is horribly complex and flaky and the absence of a gradual wake volume control makes waking up with this device a jolting affair. I will be dumping this in the trash shortly and am on the lookout for a user friendly replacement.Don't bother with this bomb. Click on faithful shopper.
4,EP,"I just bought this at Sears for less than $29.00 and it sounds very good, especially for the price!"
1,Not good,"There are three things wrong with this item. First is the brightness of the display that other reviewers have noted. The other is that it is not at all easy to set. It involves a complex series of holding buttons down, etc. Very counter-intuitive, I thought.The biggest problem, however, is that the alarm on mine will not stay on. To turn on the alarm, the instructions say to hold the alarm button, and the LCD read-out will stay the same. Well I did that, but after five minutes, the alarm was no longer showing on the LCD. The sound, etc., is good, and maybe I bought a lemon, but still it's no good if it won't do the one thing I need it to do."
3,Nice Unit - but complicated,"Good quality sound and once presets are set, works fine. Have to move antenna around for some stations, but we get some obscure stations well. The light was not a big issue for us since we use this radio in our bathroom. Actually, I think the buld is out because it isn't nearly as bright and the ""dim switch"" has no affect on it. The biggest complaint is trying to reset the time. I keep the instruction booklet handy , but it isn't intuitive... and I work with computers all day!"
1,Buyer beware!,This is a very poor item. The CD stopped working. It 's hard to get a good FM signal most of the time. The stereo output is very strange to say the least. Look at a different player...you be much happier.
3,Disappointing,"Positives:Great radio/tuner, great reception, nice external antenna wire too. Three wake alarms, battery backup, nice sound from the CD player.Negatives:- You could light an airport runway with this thing. FAR too bright, you can read with the light it puts out.- Unintuitive controls. The only control that makes sense is the snooze button, which is large and has some bumps so you can find it in the dark when the alarm rings. All the rest of the buttons are flat and hard to distinguish from each other unless you're going to turn a light on (and wake your spouse).I'm still looking for a replacement. In the meantime I have a black cloth overtop this thing at night, which makes no sense at all."
3,Not Bad,"Not a bad clock radio. It looks and sounds great but I wish it had a few more features such as a telescoping antenna instead of a wire loop antenna. The radio reception would be better. Also, a signal strength indicator would be nice to let you know the best position for the antenna. I wish the CD player was a little quieter. This radio is on my nightstand right next to my pillow. When I run the CD at night with the volume low, I can hear the CD spinning which is a bit distracting. When you listen to the radio, the station ID disappears after a few seconds. You can hit a button to make it reappear but I wish it would show all the time the radio is playing. One more thing, the display has two brightness levels. I wish it had one more level a little bit dimmer.It is definitely an improvement over their earlier models, the RC-CD300 and the RC-CD500."
2,Don't buy unless you're afraid of the dark,"This alarm clock could have been perfect. After all, it has a space-saving design, good sound quality, and a fairly user-friendly interface. The only problem is the LCD, which is so bright that you could get a set of them to use on airport runways. The bright blue light literally fills my entire room and could give any child's nightlight a run for its money. I've solved this problem by buying a satin sleep mask, not for myself, but for the alarm clock. Its elastic strap fits nicely over the top of the unit, and while I sacrifice the ability to tell time...at least I can get a good night's rest.My overall advice? Keep shopping. Buying an alarm clock that prevents you from ever falling asleep makes about as much sense as buying an umbrella with a built-in sprinkler system."
5,Love these speakers,"These speakers perform great. I painted them to match the walls in my family room and them are practically invisible. This is important for me since I'm hoping that the children will not notice them and have no reason to destroy them on me. I've got them set a part of a 5.1 system. They handle plenty of bass, but I've got the crossover set to about 80 so the my sub handles the lions share.Even my wife admits that they sound great. And as a plus, she likes how they look. Everyone wins!"
4,Great sound in a small package,I have always been a fan of Polk Audio. My living room setup had Monitor 70s and we did some rearranging and decided to wall mount the TV above the fireplace. My towers looked out of place.I purchased two sets of these in order to use one as a center channel speaker. The install was straight forward and the sound is incredible. For the price I think these cannot be beat.
4,EXCELLENT,"Polk Audio RC65i 2-Way In-Wall Speakers (Pair, White) - Excellent sound box. Since I hooked them, I'm loving the result."
2,Lacks Sound Quality,"For the price I would not recommend purchasing the Polk RC55i speakers. They do not deliver the the degree of brillance one would expect in speakers in this price range. The tones, at best, are muddy."
5,Great Speakers,"Love the sound on these clear, well priced speakers. Have owned Polk speakers for 25 years and these carry on their legendary tradition. They were easy to install, mount in the wall, sound great and help give our new home theater room a clean, uncluttered look. Loved the Amazon.com price."
5,Delighted,Very good sound quality and an easy quick install.... love the price too. Would buy or recommend this item to others.
5,Satisfyed iwht this series,"Need in wall due to room. got 6 8""to include overhead and am off brand center speaker.denon audyssey calibrated each so well. Makes the room look clean and the sound clear and crisp.no regrets. The new HD DTS and SACD audio is like descovering stereo again"
3,good speakers,"I bought these speakers because I didn't want to pay the big bucks for Klipsun speakers. They sound pretty good. Installing them was more trouble than I expected. The bass is stronger that I would like, but I hate to try and take the cover off to adjust because they were tempermental when installing them.they are probably better than my review."
4,Polk install,I put these in the wall where there was no wiring and had studs in thte way. After getting everything cut out the speakers were easy to mount. Just needed to cut slightly larger than template that came with it.These speakers sound good when set for Large on the amplifier. More BassOverall I am happy with them. Price from Amazon is good.
4,rear speakers,"I use these for the rear theater speakers so they dont really get tested to their limit. I will say they sound great for what I use them for. I would not use in wall speakers for mains no matter what brand,I use my stereo too much. Klipsch main speakers and Bose center speaker these Polk rear speakers keep up easily and are as good as the Energy speakers I did have.Easy to install and blend in well. I would buy them again great value."
3,Decent,"They are just okay. Works fine for a speaker on a budget. But if you are looking for top notch and have the money to spend, I would skip these."
5,Great In wall speakers,"I loved the sound that these little guys produce. I pick up everything in my movie room with these great speakers. I am really happy with Polk, love all their equipment."
4,Polk Audio RC85i Review,"The speakers look and sound great. I gave them a four (4) star rating because of the following:1. It would have been nice if Polk had provided two (2) templates in the box.2. If the instructions were a little more clear about how exact you have to cut the holes and how to properly utilize the drywall screws (which attach inside the drywall)3. An extra drywall screw or two would have also been nice.As for the speakers, they sound awesome. I use them as fronts for my surround sound, replaced Polk RM8 Satellites, even my wife has noticed a significant difference in the quality of sound we now get. I would recommend these speakers."
5,Great product / Bad shipping,The speakers are great. Polk products never disappoint. I wasnt happy with the way they were shipped. They were left in the same boxes as if they were bought from the store and they were just put in a plastic bag. It was pouring the day they were delivered and the speakers were sitting in a puddle of water that accumulated inside the bag.
4,Got what I expected,"The speakers installed easily and sounded good.In fact, because I didn't have time to do the job all at once, I had to put them in to cover the holes, then remove them to run the wires and re-install them. The wall-mounting mechanisms reliably installed and uninstalled each time. The aim-able tweeter is a little ""notchy"" but moves firmly. The removable grills fit securely.All that said, the speakers at an MSRP of $250 are overpriced, but if available on discount are a good deal."
5,Great sound - simple set up,There couldn't have been a better experience installing these speakers. Very easy to install. I had all four speakers installed within an hour. The sound is rich and dynamic. I am very happy with the value and performance.
2,Difficult installation,"OK quality of the speaker itself, but the installation method is horrible. The little screw locks are poorly designed. There should have been longer screws or something to keep the wall/screw locks from falling off inside the wall. Once you install the speaker there is no going back, you can not manuver the screw locks into a position to take the speaker out of the wall. I would research other speakers to find ones with a better thought out installation process."
3,Look at the Polk Website,"The polk website gives more realistic frequency information.The 30Hz - 20kHz is a little deceptive. Notice the ""Lower -3db Limit"" is 50Hz.For example, the 8 inch speakers:Overall Frequency Response 30Hz - 20kHzLower -3dB Limit 50HzUpper -3dB Limit 20kHzNominal Impedance 8 ohmsRecommended Amplifier Power 20 - 100 w/channelEfficiency 90 dB"
2,Not the kind of room filling sound I was looking for,"I recently purchased these speakers to compliment my whole house audio set-up. I also have some Klipsch 5650 in-ceiling speakers. In comparison to the Klipsch, these speakers are a pale comparison for fidelity. Next time, I'll spend the extra $200 and spring for the more impressive speakers. I hate to cut holes into drywall, run wire only to be underwelmed by these polk units."
5,Great speakers with aimable tweeters,"Installation was very easy. The frame and grill took paint beautifully and blended right into the wall. A thin film behind the grill hides the speaker cones. I wish I could have done all 5 channels with these units, but a corner installation doesn't make sense with this product.Our room is a strange shape, so the aimable tweeters really came in handy to get the surround just right. As always, it's tough to beat Polk on price vs performance."
5,Great speakers!,I installed these speakers as rear surround speakers. Installation was easy with the included templates to size the holes. They sound great and well worth the money!
4,Good for the money,"I use the on my primary home theatre system, they work great. Obviously they dont crank out great bass, but I don't expect them to. I have a subwoofer for that. I'm sure if you are a major audiofile you can probably find some issues with these speakers, but I don't think I could tell the difference between these and a much more expensive pair."
5,awesome value,"Running with my Denon AVR888, polk CSI 3 center and PSW303 sub. Sounds great. Highs and mids are clear and crisp. Adjustable tweeter helps to aim sound towards user if seating is not center of soundstage as in my case."
4,"A little too long, but exceptionally well written","This book seemed to go on forever. Ciresi is an incredibly adept writer, but for some reason there just seemed to be too much of it. I found it very hard to be sympathetic to Lisa--her reckless and self-destructive behavior was just plain annoying by the end. However, it is an insightful glimpse at a 20-something during the 80's. The front cover copy is misleading though, as it makes the book sound as if it about Lisa and her overbearing mother. That is a part of the story, but not the most important part. Overall, and enjoyable read."
4,Captivating,"This book, while not the best-written book I have read lately, caught my attention and held it. The style makes the book, rather than the characters, which alternate between being average and downright dislikable at times. But I kept turning the pages because I needed to know what happened next in the relationships (family and romantic).The date of the novel (1985) gives a heartbreaking flashback of all of the things we didn't know (or thought we knew) about HIV and AIDS. And the family could have been almost any neighborhood family I know."
2,Couln't get through it,"Be weary of this book. Although I found it to be well-written, the plot moved too slowly. I couldnt finish the book, I dont even think I got half way through it."
2,Pass this one up,"This book was a major dissapointment. The review on the back stated that Rita Ciresi was a modern day Jane Austen. I have read all of Jane Austen's stories and this was nothing like it. This novel was devoid of all the charming wit and humor in Jane Austen's novel. The plot wandered, and the characters were unsympathetic; after all, who wants to read about a girl who's problem is she works-out too much and is too skinny?"
3,The Village People of the nineties,"Let's play the game: Office Romance - Sexual harassment; Gays - aids; Jews - holocaust, xenophobia; Italians - well, maybe blue collars; Lesbians - golf. May I say more? Rita Ciresi has shamelessly exploited all the stereotypes. I was waiting for a constructor worker in a hard hat and an Indian with a feather hat to show up while I was reading. But she was pretty good doing the exploitation - I could not put the book down until it was finished."
2,Lacking Connection,"I did not connect with this book at all. The main character has so many flaws that I could not connect with her. Lisar has a history of doing drugs and sleeping around, and she constantly relapses.I did not buy into her relationship with Strauss. How can they love each other if they spend about 90% of the time arguing and bickering? I felt that Strauss deserved someone better than Lisar."
2,"The main character is so detestable, she ruins the novel","Rita Ciresi's writing style cannot really be faulted. She writes with a witty, clear pen. However, what she creates amounts to 400 pages of wasted time. Lisa is a truly loathesome character. The reader is confronted with a young woman with no self-respect; she is someone who never feels sorry for her actions, but always feels sorry for herself when faced with the consequences. She is surrounded by stock characters--her stuffy lover, her gay cousin, her lesbian boss, her Italian mother.Don't waste your time."
3,good beach read,"I read this in one weekend on the beach. It's not a very intellectual read by any stretch of the imagination, and the language grated on my nerves at certain points (like every single time the lead character's boyfriend called her ""Liser"" instead of ""Lisa""). I wish that Dodie, Lisa's cousin, had had a bigger role in the book, especially since he's jacked up to be so much more than what he was. BUT, that said... I wouldn't necessarily BUY this if I were you, but ask around and see if someone will lend it to you. Definitely worth a look."
1,don't know what to make of it,"This book is packaged as light and fun, but it's a long, slow read. It's not cohesive -- it reads like several short stories strung together. The book is supposed to be a romance, but the weakest relationship by far is between Lisa and Strauss, who won't even let him call her by his first name. When the story revolves around her family, it gets funny and readable and moves along fairly quickly. When it bogs down in her relationship with her boss, it's just boring. The ending felt abrupt and forced and was very disappointing. I know it's supposed to be a happily-ever-after for Lisa, but I just felt sorry for her."
5,I LOVED IT!,"I thought this book was easily one of the best books I have ever read. It is fun and exciting and hard to put down. Her other books, Blue Italian, and Sometimes I Dream in Italian are just a wonderful. I would reccommend all of them to anyone- any age!"
3,Too many plot lines,"This is an interesting book, particularly for the younger woman, as the descriptions of corporate life and culture are fairly accurate. However, there were too many plot lines that were not fully developed so that they often seemed very contrived."
2,Psuedo Feminist Just Wants to get Married and Pregnant,"the main character is a career gal, a sexually agressive (at least in her early years), trained liberal-arts-college feminist who can espouse the requisite lingo/literary figures/issues. yet, this supposed feminist chick's life is eclipsed by the fact that she spends the entire book trying to get herself a man. this is but one sense in which she is pathetic. she has ZERO friends other than a gay male cousin who she continually says ""gets in her way"" of her real goal in life - which one can only assume is to get a man.sure, the writing is compelling and you find yourself getting sucked in in spite of yourself..."
3,Disappointing,"I first picked up this book at a book store in the mall and started skimming through it there. It kept my interest well enough so I went home and bought it from amazon. I plunged in head first (eyes first?) when it arrived hoping the rest of the book would be as captivating as the first chapter. It wasn't. The book is inconsistant, both with it's characters and it's time frame. It's supposed to be set in 1985 but there are too many 90's overtures and this makes the story line confusing. The author is trying too hard to be ""PC"" when writing about a time when being ""PC"" had just started. Read with a notepad in hand - you'll need it to keep everything straight."
2,Started good but got bored....,"When I started reading this book, I was pretty into it, but then I got REALLY bored. It just seemed to move too slowly for my taste. I got bored with the characters and decided to give up on it. Hopefully I will enjoy her other novel, although I'm not definite that I will purchase it..."
2,I thought this book was awful,"I don't know how others can rave about great character development, but I thought there was very little in this book. The writer could have delved in so much further and developed the mother/ daughter relationship that I found to be completely lacking. The front of the book spouted about ""Lisa's mother wants her to get married so badly that anyone in pants will do,"" however it didn't really seem to be about the mom at all. I am definitely one of those who have to finish a book once they have started it, so I blame myself for weeding through horrific writing just for the sake of finishing the book."
2,Pink Slip not worth the time,"The plot about Lisa and Strauss, her boss, is somewhat fun, but the way he's written I found him dull and unemotional. The rest of the plots aren't worth the time - why she is losing weight, the sexual energy with the brother-in-law, lashing out at her mother - except the relationship with her cousin, Dodie.It would have made for a much more succinct story to have the relationship with Lisa and Strauss be parallel to her relationship with Dodie. It was drawn out in many places and too in-depth about extraneous issues."
3,Weird aftertaste,"It's okay, but it has a weird aftertaste. It's not the worst in the world, but I don't think I would ever buy it again."
5,Great Hot Lunch!,"We buy several flavors of McDougall's soups for winter outdoor activities. These are absolutely the greatest. They taste great, easy to carry in a backpack, no meat or dairy (vegan) and are ready in about 5 min after adding hot water.Perfect for skiing!!!"
4,Great stuff!,Tastes great. Easy to make. I thought the Chicken Flavor could have been a bit better. But still overall great.
5,Fantastic!,"I really like this wrench set. The grip on the bolt is tight enough that it won't round off when you apply a lot of muscle, but not so tight that you struggle to get the wrench on. The finish is wonderfull, bright and shiny chrome, not a blemish to be seen. The plastic rack the set comes in is great. I turned the rack upside down and shook it without a single wrench falling out of place. The rack also has a convenient carrying handle as well as two holes in the back to allow mounting to the wall or pegboard.I'm very pleased with the quality of this wrench set and the metric set will be my next purchase."
5,Fabulous content,"While this book may have an old-fashioned presentation, the content is first rate. As I went through this book I lost track of the number of times where I wondered ""But what if Black plays PxB?"" only to see a note saying ""If PxB, then White wins with ..."". The fellow seems to pitch his notes at a level that is reliably helpful to the average-to-good player.Also, as far as I know, there are no poor Kmoch books. All of them seem to be lucid and helpful. Get this book-it's cheap! If you like it, then grab others by the same author, you won't be sorry!When I read the book, I was rated about 1800 USCF, but even much higher rated players will be amply repaid from the study of this book."
4,"Rubinstein, the one and only.","If you want to study one of the greatest players who ever lived, this is the best book to do it from. Period."
4,"Great player, games and annotation, but horrible notation","Presumptive readers should be warned about the number of errors the author has committed in the notation which makes this book much harder to read. Page 14, move 34, there is 34 R(K)-K2 when it should be 34.R(1)-K2.Next is note to move 40 line b looks like: [44...R-B2?] 45.R-B8ch R-B1 46. R(B8)-b7)-45.K-Kt3 R(B5)-B7 etc ,when it should look like this: (44-R-B2? 45.R-B8ch R-B1 46.R(B8)-B7) 45.K-Kt3 R(B4)-B7When playing through the second game I noticed 3 more1. 16.B-Kt2 should be 16.B-KKt22.Note to whites 20th move after ""19-Kt-Kt3 (not 20. Q-Kkt3"" forgetting to add 20. KtxKt before bracket.3. 20-Kt(B)-R2 should be 20-Kt(1)-R2Apart from that, Rubinsteins games are good and well chosen and Iwould have given this book 5 stars if it wasnt for the notation errorsMatthias"
4,best text reader ever for my communication major,broad and complete view point on the issues that face college critics in media fields. Most comprehensive text I have been required to buy with my major. Would highly recommend to other prof.s
3,Wow... are we not spellchecking or editing books anymore??,"First, let me say that the premise of each article was great for a 400- or 500-level college course and prompted many heated discussions.But, along the lines of the other reviewer... how are we to take it seriously when we come across dozens of grammatical errors, missing words (the most prevalent error) and punctuation disasters? It read as though the articles were submitted, read by a third-grader and then stuffed hurriedly into the book for publication. A quick read by the ""editors"" would have found the vast majority of errors.This is not something isolated, for 3 out of the 4 textbooks I have been assigned this summer session have dozens (yes, ""dozens"") of grammatical, typographical and punctuation disasters -- books well into their 2nd, 4th and 7th editions. No wonder kids graduating college habitually spell ""too"" as ""to.""Fix the errors before you print the third edition!"
2,"Fair information, edited by a twit.","I could not finish reading the book, because I could not take the authors seriously. The many misspellings and mechanical errors were far to distracting. This text is a worthy example of how NOT to write a book."
2,Not Backlit,"I'm furious.The packaging states:Handsfree Convenience (this means the speakerphone)10 Number MemoryCall Waiting Caller ID75 Name & Number Caller ID MemeoryBacklit 3 Line LCDHearing Aid Compatible1 Year Limited WarrantyThis model is NOT backlit.I just got off the phone with GE Support (not toll-free by the way) and they said there must have been a ""typo"" on the package. Well, that's a major typo in my opinion. The GE rep stated this model is an ""old"" model. Since it's so ""old"" why wasn't there a recall on the models when the labeling error was discovered? GE will do nothing to replace this unit so I have to resort to investigating what Amazon will do for me as far as customer service. This is GE's error. The backlit feature listed is not a feature.Everything else on the phone works with the 4 fresh AA batteries I installed. The ""New Call"" light blinks when a new call is received.There is no backlight on the LCD."
1,Misleading Title,This is definitely not a handbook.It is a haphazard collection of the author's poetry and short anecdotes about his life in Asia. Do not buy this book unless you like poetry. The title is a misnomer; there isn't any useful information (from Queen Jin or otherwise) presented.
1,Never recived the item,Well not much more needs the be Sao other than I never got the item when I bought it so can't rate it
2,Don't do it,I enjoy watching biker movies in the winter but this one was hard to finish. Don't waist money buying or time watching.
4,This book belongs on your bookshelf,"I really fell in love with this book as I read through it. It does an excellent job of explaining the hairy details of working with Perl at the C level, whether etending Perl (the bulk of this book), embedding it in other apps, or hacking the guts.I haven't found any other books that try to fill this space, but even if there were this would still be the book to buy!"
3,"A good book, but leaves windows programmers short","We bought this book as part of a project we were doing in windows. We were trying to integrate perl scripting as a macro language in an existing application. Although we couldn't have done it without this book, there were still a lot of unanswered questions. The book is short on details about the build process and is focused on the unix-like command line environment. (We are now quite good at integrating perl into windows GUI apps. Contact us at www.ubcomputer.com if you're interested in our services!)"
1,She misses the mark completely..,"Patton is all over the place in this book. She tries to cover too many really huge issues and therefore misses the mark completely. She loses focus on what her real issue is and ultimately seems really confused. This book is not much more than a research paper. Patton doesn't cite references directly in the text, so I question where she got some of her statistics from because many of them seem unrealistic. The irony of the whole book is that the auther is a white woman who was adopted into a white family writing about black children adopted by white parents. Trans-ethnical and trans-racial are two different things. Judaism is not a race, it's a religion. All of this seems to elude Patton. Being married to a bi-racial, trans-racial adoptee, I feel more qualified to have written this book - and more accurately at that. I had to read this book for a class. I'm glad I didn't seek it out for factual, unbiased information."
4,"They beat the ""sophomore jinx"" with this one.","That's not to say that their first album was a runaway smash or anything but more that the second album is actually better. Yes, everyone has heard ""Message in a Bottle"" numerous times I know. It's still a good tune and a fitting one to begin the album. The title song is also a rocker as are ""Deathwish"" and ""It's Alright for You"". In the latter, the rapid fire vocals by Sting really make the song. ""Bring on the Night"" and ""Walking on the Moon"" are of a slightly slower tempo and in keeping with ""Be My Girl--Sally"" from the previous album, there's a goofy, novelty-ish song in ""On Any Other Day"". Not that any of the songs are bad, but the final three are somewhat weaker than all of the rest. No matter. I always enjoy breaking this one out and listening to it every so often. You will too."
3,Definitely their weakest CD,"The follow up to the punk oriented Outlandos d' Amour, listeners were given Regatta De Blanc, a total departure from the first. It also garnered the fewest singles. In fact, Message in a Bottle was the only real radio hit, while Bring on the Night did get some airplay.But what a difference from the first CD!An infinitely more dull album, but definitely intregal in the formation of what would ultimately become the sound and style of the Police!"
3,"Compelling Rhythms, Ordinary Songs","I'll give the Police credit for being an engaging listen. The rhythms that this band generates certainly causes me to pay attention. There are some reggae and jazz influences with some definite rock n roll energy.However as far as the songs go on Regatta De Blanc, there are some good tunes and others which are pretty forgettable. Message In A Bottle and Its Allright For You are captivating rock n roll tunes. However the title track just seems like an introductory filler piece with little in the form of meaningful lyrics. On Any Other Day is a humous tune and Bring On The Night is fine foray into jazz. However Walking On The Moon and The Beds Too Big Without You can stray on the nerves due to Sting's whiny vocals and a meandering melody line.The remaining tunes are OK but certainly not fabulous. Truthfully I find Outlandos D'Amour much more energetic. Three stars is the right verdict here."
3,Sophmore Effort Shows,Not as good as Outlandes or Zenyatta. Probably my least favorite Police album.
5,Great Police CD,"REGGATTA DE BLANC is the second great CD in a row by the Police. It has some filler on it, but even those songs are better than most of the best songs by most bands of that era. ""Message In A Bottle"" and ""Walking On The Moon"" are superb examples of how guitarist Andy Summers uses his guitar to add texture and color instead of just doing lead solos, something novel for a trio at the time. Two songs here that are highly underrated are ""Bring On The Night"" and ""No Time This Time."" Sting's opposition to Indonesia's trumped-up 2005 drug-smuggling conviction of a young Australian tourist makes this CD an essential purchase for both your ears AND your conscience."
3,"""Regatta"", they're back....!","With musical hindsight at 20/20, the Police threw off the ""shackles of rock and roll/punk"", and came up with a sound that was truly their own. Every number on this album is backed with solid musicianship, which makes Regatta De Blanc the greatest album the Police ever put out. Reggae is no longer borrowed, but used. On this album, you can hear the first notes of fushion, jazz, and pop. If it sounds like the album is plagued by inconsequential filler, it's because Sting and Stewart combed the backs of their notebooks to come up with the material needed to fill the album. Interstingly, Sting stated once in an interview that there were ""glaring holes"" in ""Walking On The Moon"". Andy 's guitar riffs practically saved the song. With this album, the Police realized that there was only three of them, and to cover their limitations, they've ""enhanced them by playing less."""
4,It's the POLICE again...,2nd release? I believe so. Expanded musically. Summers and Copeland keeping it all together. Sting a media darling of the highest order gets all the glory and actually believes it! That's rich.
4,Have we got contact... ?,"While it lacks the musical peaks of ""Zenyatta Mondatta"" or ""Ghost in the Machine"", Regatta de Blanc is ultimately a more consistant album than either of those. The two-chord head-bashers of the first album had already been left behind in favor of a bass-heavy (white!) reggae sound. Stewart Copeland contributes some wonderfully off-beat numbers (""Contact"", ""Does Everyone Stare"", ""On Any Other Day""), and Sting's brooding persona was starting to emerge (""Bed's Too Big Without You"", ""Bring on the Night""). The songs fit together well, and on the whole, Regatta da Blanc manages to be musically adventurous while remaining more humorous and personal than much of what would follow."
5,somebody call the POLICE,"this is a great recording. I love every track. I think the humor that stewart copeland brought with the song 'on any other day' was great relief. I think the humor that SC brought to the police really added a lot to taking away from some of the heavyness that sting sorta dripped out of every pore... don't get me wrong, sting was the brick of this group, but SC really did laugh a lot more than sting and seemed to enjoy fame a bit more. Sting is happy now, but SC was happy then. Great CD, every song from MIAB to NTTT is just great stuff. I particuarly liked the song 'its alright for you' a lot. Good to crank in a car..."
4,Another hit for the Police,"In sharp contrast to much of the light-sounding music from the Police's debut album, Outlandos d'Amour, their follow-up album is generally much more serious and a little more depressed. The band focuses more on the instrumental side of the music in this album as opposed to their debut, which exclusively focused on the actual songwriting. ""Message in a Bottle"" is the best early-Police song, and ""Walking on the Moon"" and ""Bring on the Night"" added to that make this album easily worth getting. Another excellent song on this CD is the more commonly overlooked ""The Bed's Too Big Without You."" You will never find this song on a best hits album, nor will you find it among their top-selling hits of all time, but it is one of the Police's best songs, second best on this album. Instrumental title track is also a good effort, but much of the rest of the album lacks the intensity and depth of those songs already mentioned. This remains an album well worth getting"
5,White of Reggae,"Have had this album on cassette tape since 1979! hadnt played it for a long long time. But when i did i was just knocked out. This is such a strong Follow up Album. Every song is a winner. The Re issue CD's are great, faithfull mixes to the Originals."
2,Salter Kitchen Timer,"I bought this for two reasons... one it's ""Salter"" and two, it was available in Harrods, Knightbridge. Two reasons I expected a great product!I was disappointed.1. It's stand does not work well, and the timer keeps falling.2. One time, it slipped and the steel plate just fell off.3. Not too simple to use the timer.I would not recommend this, although it looks sleek and elegant, and fits in my all-steel kitchen perfectly."
5,A Crowning Achievement,"Through 2 albums, Ms. Nordeman's wistful voice captivated christian radio and sent her career through the roof. Along with her voice, was her thought-provoking lyrics. Each lyric wondering, asking or leaving a question mark for the listener. And their is no exception for this album,"" Woven and spun"". This album generates soo much God driven songs, yet it could be soo easily mistaken as a secular album. In other words, Nichole doesn't want you to automatically think it's just another christian album - she want's you to give it a spin. This album clearly reflects Nichole's perception in God's Goodness from the Haunting ""HOLY"" to the soft and wistful ""Gratitude"" - Nichole definitely knows how to draw in listeners. Clearly, this is more than your "" I LOVE GOD"" christian music - it's with a message - a personal message. In the linear notes, she hopes these songs will beckon you to your knees before the Father, And into the arms of HIS Son. Nichole - mission Accomplished"
5,A Great CD,"Love this CD. It is in my CD player most of the time these days. If you've ever seen Nicole Nordemann in person, you need this CD. If you haven't seen her -- get a ticket! Ms. Nordemann is very talented, and she has a wonderful heart!"
4,No regrets purchasing this CD,"I had never heard of NN until I stumbled across one of her songs in a CD containing various collections from CCM music artists. The song was entitled ""Every Season."" WOW! I was blown away by the style, the lyrics, the voice! I had to find out who this secret person was. I found myself wandering into a christian store and looking for NN's CD's and there it was! I agree with the other reviewer's - her lyrics contain reality, but not to the point where she's drowning in misery about how far God is to her. I give this CD 4 stars because I think what she does is great, but I have my personal opinions about her lyrics and what they're trying to convey. It's hard for me to put it all in a nutshell, but simply put - God has given me such a revelation of the Christian's new identity in Christ..anyways, I'm not putting NN and her music down - you'll just have to check her out yourself. She is by far, one of my favorite music artists!"
1,Too fluffy,"Books are like best friends to me and this book would be more like an ""acquaintance"" rather than a ""friend"". I'm not a materialistic person and was put off with the title and tried to get past that while I read the book. I didn't get that much out of it and would rather have spent my time on a book with more of a story with new characters to meet. To be fair I'm not one for change and I have a few authors whom I have come to love and it's hard to live up to my expectations."
3,Too Silly,"I love the title of this book. The first time I saw it I laughed out loud. Its a play on the title of that runaway bestseller ""The Purpose Driven Life."" I expected to like this book and wanted to like it.Unfortunately, I did not enjoy this book like I hoped I would. I enjoyed the introduction, chapter 1, chapter 2, the part about purses and their role in our lives (very true). By chapter 3, it was getting on my nerves. Have you ever been around someone who cracked jokes constantly, alot of bad jokes, who just wouldn't shut up? Its like they are very witty and funny to begin with, but after awhile - enough already. That's how this book affected me. This book is just one joke or one-liner after another. And some of the things she jokes about are, in my opinion - I hate to say it - just plain stupid.I couldn't finish reading this book, but I still love the title."
3,Good - for about 3 weeks,"I bought my Gmini a chain retailer for a good price. When I took it to work, one of my co-workers said that he wished I checked with him first. He has an an older ARCHOS and had to return it twice for OS problems. He has the same problems with the third one, but he's just putting up with now.After two weeks of using my Gmini, non-stop, I thought I was in the clear. Then, it happened.The screen became garbled and the player did not respond to any key sequences. I had a hard time even getting it to reboot! After rebooting, same problems. Nothing has helped.It's a terrific player when it works, but the darn screen problem is irritating. It's going back tomorrow and I will buy a unit from another manufacturer."
3,GMINI not compatible with all Compact Flash cards,"This player is really nice. I bought this for the ability to download JPEGS from Compact flash cards. I was suprised that it hang on downloads from my two CF cards. I tried my buddy's cards and they downloaded without a problem. Please note that I have upgraded the firmware. The cards that did not work are the lower priced, heavily discounted cards such as PQI 256 (bought at Fry's) and a SIMPLETECH 512. The better brands such as Kingston 64MG, Sandisk ULTRA 256, and VIKING 512MG all worked without problems. A call to ARCHOS tech support resulted in the tech support person not being aware of any compatibility issues.That's the reason I am giving it 3 of 5 stars....."
4,Nice Form for the Price,"I bought the GMini 220 because the of the features for the price (I wanted the compact flash interface to transfer pictures). I have had it a week. The unit is compact and sturdy. The user interface is usable but not fantastic. It plays well and I like it. Transferring files is easy (although I don't like the Musicmatch Jukebox software very much, I just copy the files on).One Small annoyance is that to use headphones other than the ones which came with it, you need a small external adapter (which comes with it).I haven't tried to transfer pictures to it yet.Overall, I am very happy with the purchase."
4,My first Mp3 player,This is the first Mp3 player I have had. I had never heard of Archos but after reading reviews I purchased it. I like it a lot although so far have not explored all the uses for it. As far as loading my Cd's into it I have had a few problems but the problem is not with the product. Sound is very good but have nothing to compare it to. So far I am happy with my purchase and hope to use it for a long time to come.
2,first time i disliked something enough to write a review,"I really liked the concept of having a portable hard drive AND an MP3 player. I was worried about carrying around a hard drive, due to fragility. It did indeed start acting up about a week after I bought it. However, instead of the hard drive being the source of the problem, the display was getting very garbled and sometimes even completely reversed. I tried tech support before returning it, just to get an idea of how good their support is in case I wanted to exchange it for another Gmini, but I haven't heard back from them in over a week. The store was out of them, and didn't have any on order. I gladly took my money back."
2,"Good intention, wrong implementation","It is inconceivable to me how companies like Archos could have it all and consistently sabotage themselves. What is missing on the market is a simple-to-use, high-capacity player (40GB and up) for playing and recording multiple music formats, and data backup, not two similarly deficient products from the same company in different form factors with ""downloadable plug-ins"". The later idea is cheap captialism and razorblade marketing and simply moronic. If the player has all these capabilities, why not sell it all-in-the-box ready to go? I bought a different player/recorder and I am convinced that Archos looses a lot of customers due to such pathetic marketing (and a website that looks like from the beginnings of the web.)"
4,Battery life is killer,"I got my Gmini 220 in summer of 2005, when iPods were doing the circuit and they had yet to come out with the ability to see color photos. I was ecstatic about it and did not mind the fact that it was not color. The bulky-ness of it is not that attractive but could be worse. The fact that MusicMatch Jukebox sucks means nothing to me because I don't and haven't been able to sync with it, instead I use it as other users do and pretend its a hard drive.The biggest downfall has to be the battery which for me last only about 4 or 5 hours. The fact that I can't replace it just makes me sad and there's hardly any point to hooking it up to my car because out of 3 possible bars of battery, it will quickly go to 1 bar and very soon just stop playing.But really above all, its small, you can show pictures to your friends, you can have people ask you if its a Zune, and no one knows really what it is so they won't steal it."
1,Archos Products and Support Is Horrible,1. No 800 number for support.2. Hard drive failed.3. Error messages display without completely loading the Archos OS; so impossibe to run WinScanDisk or reformat the hard drive and reload the Archos OS.3. This is my second Archos product to fail after 1 year of moderate use. (approx 12 hours a week)
1,"Crashed continuously, finally stopped booting","I thought this would be a perfect companion to my 8MB digital camera. I was totally wrong. The gmini crashed continuously, shutdown in the middle of playback, and finally stopped responding altogether. Fortunately it was still within my 14 day return period so I was able to get my money back. I would not recommend this product to anyone."
4,Pretty good!,"I bought my Archos G Mini 120 with a bit of hesitation... the reviews didn't seem the best. However, I recieved it and happily discovered it even came with the software to record audio. All the features were only $160, a steal when you compare it to the $300 Ipod. And, Ipod's don't support WMA format. The G Mini definitely fits in your pocket, weighs 8 oz., (which by the way is less than half a pound, so you people who said it was too heavy and bulky aren't even close) and went at least 8 hours on the battery. I accidentally downgraded the software, and that caused some problems, needless to say, but I fixed it by going back to the present software. It holds around 4,000 mp3 songs, but can't view pictures or other types of files - it only stores them. Still, I say it's a good buy, my only complaint is that it's hard to make a playlist (tedious) and to browse."
3,Archos - Cheaper than the rest in price and quality,"I got my GMini for Christmas, after researching the market thorougly. It did everything I needed: WMA compatible, recorded into MP3 great, and held all my MP3's. But, all of a sudden, it wouldn't come on. So I sent it to Archos, and nearly a month later, I get it back, and it still is having issues! When I turn it on, it indicates a song is playing, but I hear nothing. Only after several restarts, will it work correctly. DO NOT buy this product - save a little longer and get a little more expensive product."
4,Strength beyond her years,"Aselin Debison has a pop perspective but a down-home sense about her. The young Glace Bay native from Cape Breton, NS, who entered the recording studio and her teens at about the same time, has a pure, clear voice with a strength beyond her years.There's no question Aselin has the voice of a teen, and yet she lacks the saccharine quality so common among some of her peers. If she sticks to her current path, she could easily straddle the boundary between pop and Cape Breton folk and find some commercial success while staying true to her roots. Let's hope so!"
4,Wonderful and Original,"I love Aselin Debison and can't wait for another CD to come out. Her songs are so different from what is usually heard. My favorite songs were ""Dance You Choose"", ""Moonlight Shadow"", and ""Getting Dark Again"".The only song that I can't stand to listen to is the medley of Somewhere Over the Rainbow and What a Wonderful World. However, I think that this is only because it is hard to compare to Judy Garland and What a Wonderful World irritates me.Overall, this CD is worth the money."
4,Sweet Is the Melody,"I purchased 'Sweet Is the Melody' by Aselin Debison from Amazon. I was unable to play it on my regular DVD player and had to listen to the recording on my computer. I love the songs by Ms. Debison, but was disappointed in that there were no photography with the singing because I enjoy watching her sing. I had watched her singing on TV when she was younger. She presents in a home spun type of singing that I enjoy."
5,Aselin Debison CD,"I purchased this Aselin Debison CD for my mom because she loves the song ""The Gift."" It's a really beautiful song and it rarely gets played on the radio. Aselin Debison has a really lovely voice."
5,So beautiful,"This young lady sings like an angel. I love this cd. Play it all the time. Never get tired of hearing her songs. The song ""The Gift"" is the most moving song I have heard. I bought the cd just for that song but love the rest of the songs also."
5,ASELIN DEBISON'S DEBUT ALBUM IS FABULAS,"When I listen to it I have no words to describe it. When you look at this, it will blow you away, you just want to buy it right there and then. Then you want to tell/put the cd on so your family/friends know about this. When they they listen to it, they will like I have to buy it for myself, and so on. Thank you."
4,Very Impressed,"I was very impressed with this recording. I'm mostly in to opera, so I wasn't sure if I would like this when it was presented to me as a gift. However I have found this album to be quite refreshing. The songs have been arranged nicely, and been brightened up to fit a more lively atmosphere. And Aselin at her young age, shows exceptional promise for the future. I would definitly get her a voice teacher to help her maintain her voice if she makes this her career for the time being, to ensure her voice maintains its natural sound. Her voice can be a bit nasal, but Aselin has compiled a great cd that is definitly worth a good listen."
2,"there may be potential there, but ...","I'm not sure what I was expecting when I purchased this CD, but it was certainly more than this considering the glowing reviews. She sounds like a 12-year-old girl who can sing -- and that's all. If there is a children's or young adult choir at your local church, you can hear others who sing at least as well as this young lady.She has a pleasant voice -- nothing outstanding in this particular release -- and she may have potential, but this just reinforces in my mind how much luck, timing and serendipity have to do with success in popular music."
1,Disappointed that CD didn't meet expectations,When I read several great media reviews for this CD and that Canadian Prime Minister Chretien was touting her as the greatest Canadian singer ever it seemed like a must buy. I was very disappointed because the singing lacked emotion and depth and just never seemed to catch the right vein. By example the song Rise Again received a much more lyrical treatment on the Rankin Family's album North Country. It is not a CD I would recommend. Hopefully in time Aselin's voice will mature and mellow but it is not there now. For youthful 'lyric' singing Charlotte Church is by far my preference.
4,Classic Grace,"I don't mean to be critical when I write this, because I'm a singer and know how it feels, but I think Aselin's voice is a bit imature. The song ""Over The Rainbow"", is very different.Aselin's style is nice, but I'm into classical so this isn't my style.However I think, she tried hard, and perhaps will do better in the futre."
1,Amazing? yeah right,"I can't believe this girl even got a record deal! She sounds like what she is, a little kid. If this is considered ""incredible"" then I know at least 10 people who should be considered absolutely astounding. If you want a kid with a great voice, try Charlotte Church."
1,Too bad it's SONY,Was going to buy this but I have been boycotting SONY since they won't let you play (or copy) their CD's on computer.
1,Garbage,"The garbage-LP entitled ""Sweet Is the Melody"" can be useful only to stimulate the catabolic functions or to be used (for a joke) as a ""scarecrow"" in order to force my colleagues to angry leave the room. The sweetest melody for all us is when I stop the ""music"" play."
3,"Appalling sound quality, great historical document","This is an album of the great, historically triumphal, giving-the-dictatorship-the-bird concert that Brazilian pop superstars Caetano Veloso and Gilberto Gil held just before they had to go into exile in Europe for two years... If you're into the whole tropicalia mythology, then you must at least listen to this album... That being said, I didn't keep my copy, because the sound quality (of the original board mix) is just terrible... It's really more of a reference work, rather than an album that's fun to listen to..."
2,A troubling illustration warrants the low rating.,"This book is a charming poem and contains beautifully drawn illustrations. They don't always flow smoothly, however. The book contains two fold-out pages of illustrations attached to the front and back covers of the book. The illustration of the ghostly witch with a torch is strongly reminiscient of a Ku Klux Klan member. I am Caucasian, so I have no agenda, except to say that illustration really bothered me. I can imagine the effect it would have on African Americans. It would be horrifying.Debbe MayChildren's LibrarianCampbell County Public LibraryCold Spring, KY"
4,halloween lover,I love the graphics and colors of this book. I keep it with my other Halloween books and art. Thank you very much :o)Kristine H
4,"Its NOT ""Picture IN Picture"" it's ""Picture AND Picture""","It's a great TV but I do perfer picture-in-picture (PIP). This model though has only Picture-AND-Picture (PAP) which is quite different. PIP allows you you to have one full screen picture with a small picture superimposed over it in a corner. It also allows you to quick change between the two. Picture AND picture tries to split the viewing screen area into two equal pictures, displaying both channels ... leaving a lot of unused real estate."
1,Lying shipper--do not buy this product,"I cannot review the product (originally listed for $1,000.00 dollars more), because Crates Direct pulled a switcheroo and sent an inferior, cheaper model whose true price IS $1,199.99 and not the $2,999.99 they charged me but refuse to alter.If you order this one, don't expect to get it."
3,A Student Perspective,"After reading the book in class, our teacher let us watch the movie. In my mind, the characters were way different that I had visualized. I found that there were many differences between the book and movie. Differences that changed it in a few ways. They did not change it drastically, it still had the same story line that Knowles has in the book. I would choose the book over the movie for the small descriptive details that Gene adds in his thoughts that are not expressed in the movie. Although, the movie is enjoyable to watch after you have read the book."
2,Good for its kind,"I was in this film, along with about 100 other preppies. It's pretty close to the book, with a few minor changes. Some parts will remind you of Owen Meany. The staircase will.The trial scene is too long, but the Hampton Beach footage is beautifully done. I don't see any other way of filming it."
4,"Overall, not too shabby","Poor John Heyl. Whatever happened to him...? He played Phineas in this film and did so rather well, I thought. Parker Stevenson is a very unfortunate, one-dimensional, barely-able-to-convince-us-he's-a-real-character Gene; this is troublesome since the entire story behind ""A Separate Peace"" is really's Gene's own. The supporting cast did a fine job...the actor who played Leper was credible, and Brinker's role was filled very adeptly as well. What pleased me most was the firm adherence of the film to Knowles' novel, which is one of my favorite works of American literature. I'd like to see the 2003 made-for-TV version of the book but cannot locate it on VHS; the 1972 rendition is still, in my opinion, a tremendously commendable adaptation."
4,A Separate Peace,"The director took a wonderfully clean novel and added vulgarities that demeaned it. Yet, it is rated PG. It's a sad day when a parent would recommend such language.It would have received 5 stars had it retained the beautuful language of the novel."
3,Mediocre but helpful,"As a high school English teacher, I tend to do a lot of compare/contrast work with my students. I used this video to compare with the novel, which my sophomore students read and listened to on audiotape.Overall, they were disappointed and bored with the video. The acting is often stilted and stereotyped, although I realize that the parts were very difficult to cast.The use of the original setting of the school was helpful for imagery.What the cinematographers did in relation to ""the tree"" was good and helped my students grasp its symbolism better.I felt that the video version left out several important elements of the theme, which was unfortunate.Overall, the movie was mediocre but helpful. I hope someone tackles this key piece of literature again and does a remake that is more on the mark."
1,There are good movies and than there is A Seperate Peace,"If you wanted to see a good perception of adolescence and friendship you would go and rent Francois Truffaut's The 400 Blows. If you wanted to see portrayal of prep school students you would see Lindsay Anderson's If... But if you want to see bad acting, campy dialogue, and 25 year old prep schoool students watch A Seperate Peace. I mean when about half way in I started to believe Gene was turning into Travis Bickle from Taxi Driver. And besides it was more boring than church. If there is a scale from one to ten, ten being the best and one being the worst this trashy garbage recieves a negative 25-Regan S. Luke"
2,Show some emotion Gene,"I'm telling you now, don't read this unless you've seen the movie, because I spoil it. In my English class, we read the novel as a class. I liked the book and I thought it wasn't that bad. Then, we watched the movie. I can tell you that my whole class kept laughing at the bad acting. From when you see Finny on the ground after he falls when Gene jumps in the water, to Gene's completly emotionless reaction when he learns that Finny has died. Many of the parts were changed. Such as the scene in the butt room and the movie is nothing like I thought it would be. I just have to say that I thought the actor who played Brinker was really hot. So, the movie was fine but the acting was laughable."
2,Nyeh...,"This vaguely classic John Knowles teen novel about one prep school student's secret envy of his best friend during World War II could have been given a better film treatment. Apparently the production crew just pulled up at Philips Exeter Academy one day and started recruiting school talent to be in the movie, rather than hiring proper actors, and the film suffers for it. Read the book instead; it's not too long."
1,Get the Peter Yates DVD instead,"Once upon a time many semesters ago, I showed this VHS version of ""A Separate Peace"" after having had my sophomores read the novel. It was torture, and I had to tell the class to stop talking almost from the get-go. The novel is a masterpiece. Why kill it with this under-budgeted miscarriage? Get the new and improved Peter Yates version, which is available only on DVD, and you won't regret it. It's far from perfect, but what film that tries to take on a classic piece of literature isn't? The newer production features far better cinematography, directing, and acting. Stay away from this dog."
1,"20 YRS LATER NO 12""","For some reason this record has been out for over 20 years yet no 12"" for this record has ever been transfered to cd.Why??? What are you waiting for another 20 years.Get with it this record has never been properly remastered."
2,A Disappointment,"This album paled in comparison with ""Control."" While ""Control"" was fresh and funky, this album was bombastic and overprocessed. There are certainly some good songs on this album, but they just aren't that much fun. ""Rhythm Nation 1814"" was the huge hit that ""Control"" should have been."
5,A History Making Album,"RHYTHM NATION 1814, is an interesting album. While critics were intent on labeling Janet as another ""Jackson with a few hits"", she wanted to show more than growth, but also the world in her eyes. This record is very much a concept album about society and how it is going down both in humanity and morals. The record starts off with a serious tone, but as the record progresses, the songs change from dark and moody to light and fun. this record was the best selling album of 1990, beating out many other sucessful records. This album sold very well....about 15 million units. The first albumto release 7 top 5 singles. ""Miss You Much"", ""Escapade"", ""Black Cat"", and ""Love Will Never Do (Without You)"" hitting number 1 on the Billboard singles chart. 13 years later, this record along with Madonna's LIKE A PRAYER holds up really well. This record is a symbol of Janet's talent. I would also reccomend 1997's THE VELVET ROPE."
5,Simply the best,"Ms. Jackson's fourth studio album Rhythm Nation 1814 was simply one the best albums she ever put out (only tied with Velvet Rope and Control). The album opens up with the Pledge which state that they are a nation of people not bound together by race but by dance, this is her way of letting the listener know to except something not only beautiful but also something very groovy and trust me she delivers on both counts. The title track is one of the best dance songs on the album and features a thumping new jack swing back track. Following that is the very groovy yet socially conscious State of the World which is one of the deepest songs she ever put out. Miss You Much and Love Will Never Do You both in the middle of the album are also worth mention as well. The interlude No Acid is a short not to missed anti-drug ad which is followed by the hard rock song Black Cat, which would kick off a trend of her having at least one rock style song on her album."
4,International rhythm 1989,"Surely this is the cd that made janet a fixture in most countries charts.The album is a step beyond the previous one, and angrier and more energic if possible.She shows she took control for good of her own persona and idea.The teaming with Jam/Lewis is as fruitful as ever:BLACK CAT is one of those tunes you'd never expect to be sung by a black female, yet janets handles the spicy guitar riffs just as good as the acid beats on the title track and MISS YOU MUCH.LOVE WILL NEVER DO WITHOUT YOU and ESCAPADE bring to life her joyful dance side, COME BACK TO ME is a plead to a long-lost lover that runs under your skin.And through it all, she has been able to come up with a one-vision project that rocketed her on top of the charts back in 1989.Just good."
4,Rhythm Nation 1814: Janet's Pivotal Followup!,"Recording an album as strong and sucessful as ""Control"" would be very tough, but Janet came close with this follow-up. The album contains songs of race,social life,and poverty bordered six Top Ten hits, with ""Miss You Much"" and ""Escapade"" being among them. You go, Janet!"
5,Queen of Rhythm Nation !,"This album is considered her biggest album and I will give her credit for it to. Rhythm Nation 1814 hit #1 on the billboard charts for 4 weeks straight and was certified 6 x Platuim which means Approx.. in that time it sold around 6 million in the USA... but to date it sold close to 24 million world wide. The album set a WORLD RECORD.. She realeased 8 singles form this album and 7 of the singles hit TOP FIVE which no other artist was able to have 7 singles off one album and all of them hit TOP FIVE on the billboard charts, and 4 of those singles (Black Cat, Miss you Much, Escapade, and Love will never do) hit #1 on the billboard charts. Very good album this is ablum is like a mini greatest hits album. I recommend hit wise on album to choose are Rhythm Nation 1814, Control, Janet, Velvet Rope and All For you.. Until she releases a better greatest hits.. This is money well spent."
4,Dancing And Partying Nation,"Janet gives us truths, reality, ""The Knowledge"" and sympathy all over commercial pop/dance tunes. Co-written and co-produced by Ms. Jackson there's no need to go deep into details. My favoriate tracks start at track 17 to the conclusion. ""Someday Is Tonight"" is a definate love making song with words sang like ""...No more fantasizing, you'll ever have to do, 'cause tonight baby, all your dreams come true..."" It's Janet Jackson if you're nasty."
4,socially,this album is about caring about the issues in the world. my hats of to janet for writing socially conscience songs that actually sound good.
4,"Not a novel or a fiction, but chilling, anyway!","This book offers the reader a wide perspective about chemical weapons and how they have been used in the past. As a historic reference, it is invaluable, and as a work that helps the reader imagine what could happen in the future, this is a must. Every person involved or worried about mass destructions weapons, must read and treasure this book."
2,No association with the ASA Newsletter,"The Richard M. Price who wrote ""The Chemical Weapons Taboo"" is not the same Richard M. Price who has been in chemical and biological and radiological defense since 1983. This is just a coincidence of names."
4,Solo Repair Kit,"It was nice to get one complete kit that had everyting that I needed, fit properly and with adequate instructions."
4,Diaphragm great for Solo sprayer,"Recently I purchased the Solo diaphragm sprayer pump repair kit. The old one had split so I looked up ordered a replacement part from Amazon.The replacement packet wasn't too complicated to install. Has worked great withSolo 4900405-K Sprayer Pump Repair Kit for Models 454, 456, 457 and 457-Rollaboutno problems. My Solo sprayer is about six years old so if you own a Solo I would highly recommend ordering a sprayer pump repair kit from Amazon.com. They are fast and reliable."
5,I Love It!,"I have been an Al Jarreau Fan for 25 years, and I can truly say that this is one of his best efforts to date. I play it over and over."
5,Jarreau 2nd raises his stock yet higher.........,"Al Jarreau's place in contemporary music history is assured and with work like this it will prove an enviable legacy. This album is his second for GRP and it's classic JARREAU. His unique welding of soul, funk, pop and jazz is always pefectly balanced.This C.D is full of strong songs ""LIFE IS"" is the smoothest piece of funk ever as good anything GEORGE CLINTON OR J.B could muster, hectic agitated arrangement make it impossible to sit still to.OASIS is where he really shines it's quite simply will become a formidable jazz standard for all afficionadosit's even more impressive as this song was co written by the great man himself.RANDOM ACT OF LOVE sets up the c.d perfectly it's an optimistic mid tempo groove which is addictive after the first listen about the pleasure of giving and if our AL keeps on giving like this his fans will remain loyal and wholly satisfied as I've been for the past 20 years. Pamper yourself and buy it now!"
5,One of his best,"This is one of Al's best. Of all the songs, ""Jacaranda Bougainvillea"" and ""All I Got"" are my favorites and they are written and performed by his touring band. Freddie Ravel and Jota Morelli and Chris (bass player) are just fantastic. The story behind how Al wrote ""Jacaranda"" is fascinating and is on his website, aljarreau.com.A definite MUST BUY!"
2,not what i expected,"I just want people to know that this is not the Al Jarreau of ""breakin away"". It's ""smooth jazz"" elevator music. Might be some people's bag, but not mine. I heard his new album ""accentuate the positive"" is more the Al of old."
2,"Buster Crabbe is Great, The Serial is Bad","I love Buster Crabbe and Flash Gordon is a terrifc serial. Buck Rogers however... in fairness Buster give it the college try but the production values are bargain basement and the story line is grade school level. Did I enjoy it, yes but only for the fun of watching Buster. There are a couple of decent story elements - the ""transporter"" idea, which was copied 30 years later by Star Trek and and Anti Gravity belts - good touches, but too little too late. Watch it to round out your serial viewing, but don't expect anything too great."
4,Great Art Deco fun.,"While not as well known (and to be honest, not quite as good) as Flash Gordon there is much to like about Buck Rogers, especially the Art Deco sets. Add this to your collection along with Metropolis and Things To Come and you've pretty much covered the Art Deco/Science Fiction connection that began in the 1930s and continues to this day.One person who obviously liked Buck Rogers was George Lucas. The story line and visuals of Buck Rogers and Star Wars are so similar its almost copyright infringement."
5,What a swell movie!,"That's probably the way someone would have described this thrill-packed adventure from 1939 that awaits you. The picture and sound quality are excellent and so are the evil villains, robot men, spaceships, aliens, futuristic weapons, matter transporters, anti-gravity belts, heroes and heroines. Have a whiff of nirvano gas, suspend your disbelief and leap ahead 500 years into the future with Buck Rogers!"
3,Interesting devices but plot is weak.,"One of the few good aspects of this serial is the use of futuristic devices such as transporters and a cloaking device, concepts later seen on the original Star Trek, and high speed tunnel transports, later seen in the movie Logan's Run. The fading marquis that introduces each episode was also copied by the Star Wars movie.The rest of the serial consists mostly of back and forth travels between planets and places. There are also a large number of physical skirmishes between Buck Rogers and Killer Kane's cronies. Constance Moore is obviously beautiful but the military style pants and cloth helmet largely obscure her feminine beauty.There is a nice scene at the end but the scene disappoints because the series ends with the backs of the protagonists facing the camera. Due to the weak plot, I only recommend this series if you want to see a historically significant film."
2,Disappointed,"While I looked forward to seeing the series again I guess I was expecting too much.The disk looks like a copy of a copy of the orginal film. The series is complete but too many scenes are dark around the edges and hard to make out the charactors. I would suggest you save your money for a better copy, if and when it should come out."
4,Bullseye review,"The packaging was a great disappointment. It looked as if we were receiving a used toy. We also were disappointed that the item, as advertised, was not available so a different one was substituted. We were notified of this, however, and could find nothing else, so we were glad to get the substituted toy. Our granddaughter is enjoying this Bullseye because it is the correct size to match her other Toy Story 3 figures, but we wish it was stiff enough to support a figure and still stand. She notes, however, that this way she can take him to bed because he is soft all over."
3,"Where is ""Let it Ride""?","If you're going to do a 79 minute compilation of BTO from their 1970's stuff, ""Let it Ride"" absolutely MUST BE INCLUDED. It was their first hit- the song that ""broke the band"" and many people's favorite BTO song (mine too). It's very annoying when record companies deliberately leave off key cuts so that we have to buy another CD to get the basics. And for BTO, ""Let it Ride"" is as basic as it gets.That said, what's here is fine. Some good choices were made in the album cuts that were included. However, if you're doing 10 minutes on BTO's best, let alone 79 minutes, include the basics."
3,Shooting rest bag,"Not the bag they appear to be, they just don't conform to the rifle as well as the leather set i've owned for years, purchased these so i would a better choice of height adjustment, would not purchase again. Will probably try to sell on Craigslist."
1,Do Not Purchase,Item is too small for my needs. A seam ripped the same day I received it and that was not due to abuse....stitching appears to be minimal and nylon material is minimal at best. Called Allen company to discuss the extreme packing inside and was advised that it should not have been filled at all?? There's a zipper that should allow filling and unfilling but numerous attempts to open it failed.....again the packing material was far too tight and stressed the zipper. Would not recommend this to anyone for any purpose!
2,Very Small. Not what expected.,"This was smaller than expected: a mere 4.5"" wide by 2.5"" high. Yes, dimensions are listed, but it is TINY. Really tiny. Can fit in your coat pocket which might be an advantage for some, but not for me. It comes with velcro straps on the bottom to hook to something that I'd prefer they left off as they get in the way and make it off balance for using it on flat surfaces. Quality seems good, but am overall disappointed in bench rest."
3,Too short,Quality appears to be first rate but it is smaller than I expected. Would like it to be taller for better clearance.
5,great cot for big guys,"I bought this cot to use on camping trips and hunting trips.It is exactly what I needed. I am 6'4"" 270lbs and this cot holds me and is very sturdy.It has plenty of room to move unlike some other cots I have used in the past. Love my BIG GRIZZLY!!!!!!!!!!"
4,"Loved the cot, hated the assembly",The legs were extemely difficut to put on. It took two strong men and 20 minutes to finally get the legs on the cot. Once put together the cot was very comfortable.
1,Do not buy this cot,Even my strong male friend could not put the legs on this cot.We could not use it for the trip we bought it for. I will try and return it. To give the company benefit of the doubt...maybe mine was just defective?!?If we could get it together...it is light-weight and has the cell phone holder and drink holder and is as large as promised.
1,Very disappointed,"What I received are three fasteners and three caps, not 4. I feel very disappointed. Also the wrapper is not the same as shown in the picture. They are totally different brands."
1,Doesn't work on my car,"1. The screws I received is another brand, not as shown in the picture.2. They are too long to match my Saab license plate holder, useless for me."
3,Lock-nut?,"I bought these with 4 other packs of similar license plate fasteners to compare how they fared before putting them on the car.The package was as appears above, but I'll not put the 'locking' screws in, as they are actually one-way flat-head screws, sort of like they use to put bathroom stalls together.The plastic/nylon fasteners appear to be the same as the others purchased."
2,Would not buy again,"Right away the main charm broke off, then the rest started to fall apart. The quality was not really that good. I would not ever replace the bracelet."
3,"Good only for the music and scenes of London, but nothing else","The dialogue is over-the-top pretentious and the acting is not even good enough to be considered second-rate, but the music and setting make this a film worth watching. I just watch it piecemeal now(ie-the musical performances and some panorama shots that are interesting), as I cannot stomach the silly, preachy almost 'Clockwork Orange-y' type dialogue that is supposed to be foreboding and cryptic, it would seem. Still, aside from that, looking at how similar the punk styles still are to this day is nearly as interesting as anything else."
3,punk Ficton,Not quit what I was expecting but interesting all the same. acting was a little amateur and story jumped around a bit. Didn't get the point of the movie. Would suit cult punk fans
2,Punk quality,"I saw this film (what I could stand) because I was curious about Toyah Willcox as an actor. I had to go to the end credits to find out which character she was. I was expecting the beautiful woman from the cover of her ""Minx"" album. Instead, from 1977 I got a sort of chubby teenager playing ""Mad"", a punk girl with a carot crewcut. Not interesting.It is a very ambitious movie, and perhaps it should earn points for that. But it is just so poorly conceived. Poorly film, poor sound, attrocious acting, bad timing.You may like it if you like punk sensibility and garage band production values."
1,Poor choice for Criterion fans,1% of Criterion movies should never have been made this falls into the 1%.
3,it does feel kinda like an x-files episode,"The acting is solid, even impressive at times. And, much like x-files, the producers manage to do more with a limited budget. The story is good, up to a point when it eventually deteriorates a little into sci-fi ""wierdness"" but still holds your attention nonetheless. If you enjoyed almost any x-file, it's likely you'll enjoy this too ...."
1,What happens when Scandanavians try and do X-Files,"Film opens with an astroid crashing into the Arctic Ocean in 1859. A great opener, great special effects.Then a mysterious death in 1996, which Smilla, a loner, begins to investigate. At times, scenes resembled the X-FILES, as mysterious killers and conspiracists and prehistoric worms brought to life all enter the picture.But most of it is like a self-absorbed Ingmar Bergman film. Long boring scenes emphasizing how depressed and alienated all the characters are. I didn't much care for any of them, and it was tough putting up with their dreary lives.I taped this off the Independent Film Channel, and forced myself to watch it over two days, just to see how it all turned out. I was too bored to see it all on the same day.Film made me glad I don't live in Denmark."
4,between Mystery and Sci Fi,"I thought the acting and filming were extraordinary in this film.The death of a young boy in mysterious circumstances leads to a story of an ancient meteorite, a prehistoric worm and corporate greed.The result is a strange love story where the stuttering Gabriel Byrne is never what he seems and the strong female character is the toughestwoman lead I've seen in a long time.I really liked this film and the character Smilla."
2,A mixed bag,"An odd mix of genres, starting off as an internal psychological drama (cf. ""Insomnia"") and shading into science fiction/conspiracy thriller. The main appeal of this movie is trying to figure out what kind of movie it is.Julia Ormand is supposed to be playing a primeval, almost feral woman who's constantly at odds with modern civilization. Instead she looks and acts so delicate that she's more like a pouty supermodel. When she finally shuts up her father's whiny mistress, it's a catfight, not the act of someone capable of serious violence.The wintry photography is actually the best part of it, and gives a strong sense of place. Too bad it wasn't in the service of a better story."
3,The book must be better,"I rented this with high hopes, but was eventually disappointed. The casting seems superb and the visuals capture a mood, but I had the sense throughout of a depth of detail and intrigue that was lacking in the movie. There are hints of mysterious facts that are never fully explained, relationships between characters that shift unexpectedly without enough development. Gabriel Byrne's character seems intriguing and appropriately mysterious, but the development of his relationship with Smilla (Julia Ormond) is glossed over to such an extent that it rings false.The final confrontation devolves into a James Bondian gun fight on a glacier, which by no means lives up to the promise of the earlier plot development of the movie."
4,Interesting Drama,"Smilla's Sense of Snow is an interesting thriller. There are many conflicts between the main character and her family, her heritage and authority. This is a little slow to get going but is exciting towards the end of the film."
3,Read the book first.,"There seems to be two schools of thought on this movie; either it was very good or very bad. I think it depends on if you read the book first. Those who did not would be hopelessly confused by the movie in my opinion. It was not a good adaptation and left out many, many plot points that would explain so much of what was going on. Those who did read the book might like the movie better, but will still find it lacking in so much of what made it a good novel. The problem is Hoag's work was far too complex to wrap up in a two-hour movie, especially one that would appeal to the masses. Gabriel Bryne and Julia Ormond both deserve credit for their roles; they did a fantastic job. I recommend reading the book and then checking out the movie; it will be a much more enjoyable experience."
2,"Certainly offbeat, but quite flat","Thriller about some nonsense involving a meteor and Greenland Eskimos. The female lead has one speed: flat. Absolutely no heat between her and her alleged costar boyfriend. The little boy has a good part, but barely speaks. The plot is silliness. I was tired of Julia Ormond's non-stop anger about 20 minutes into this two hour film. Why didnt she just move back to Greenland if she was so angry about being taken from it? Good riddance! Watch if you have nothing else to do."
5,The European Julia in A European Film,"Like Insomnia, this is a great Scandinavian suspense film. A mysterious film with a beautiful lead actress (Julia Ormond), and an enigmatic male lead (the elusive Gabriel Byrne). A thinking person's film. The last time I saw it was years ago, and it still lingers in my memory as one of my favorites. The cold scenes will leave you craving hot chocolate (or coffee, this is Scandinavia!) with your popcorn. It takes you out of yourself, which is what a good film is supposed to do. Highly recommended."
4,DIFFERENT,"I was fascinated by Julia Ormond in this flick. I'd seen it a long time ago and decided I wanted a ccopy since it's never on TV. It's a mystery about a young boy who either fell or was pushed off a roof. Even though it didn't get great reviews, I really enjoyed it as I especially like mysteries. Gabriel Byrne is also in this movie. Try it, maybe you'll also like it as I do."
4,great acting by Julia Ormond and Gabriel Byrne,"One of the better films of the last years. Great film-making and lot of suspense, original plot, and above all superb acting by Julia Ormond and Gabriel Byrne. I hope to see more of them in the near future."
3,Inspired shenanigans,"3 1/2Perhaps the weirdest Brazilian Jazz disc ever worth respecting, this bizarre mixture, one drop traditional and ounces of out-there, shouldn't stand up, let alone to the test of time, and is a bit too abrasive and earnestly experimental for its own good, but Veloso's druggy intuition and exciting pace make for a fascinating hear."
3,Useful but flawed,"I teach an animation writing class and have used Wright's book for the past two or three years. It not only contains useful insights into animation writing but also provides perspective through such topics as the history of animation and understanding the tastes of various audiences according to age group. I've also used her chapter on pitching a script for an oral communications course. However, I often find that her paragraphs aren't all that coherent in that she jumps from idea to idea. It sometimes seems as though a lot of this is first-draft material. Perhaps the next edition will be more readable. Overall, this is a useful supplement to other materials. I haven't found a perfect animation writing book yet, so this one will do for now."
5,No Better Music in This Modern World,"Sorry to gush ineloquently, but this album is just so much better than anything I've bought in the last 2-3 years (except maybe Kicking Television by Wilco) that I must. ""This Modern World"" alone is worth the price of the album: a masterpiece. Seriously, the song is SICK good if you care about song craft and recording craft -- I mean, how about the drum roll intro? Give it up for the drummer! WK has it all, apparently. We just need more of the same."
3,Hard to get into,"I was turned on to this author by reading Joanna Macy. However, Korten failed to hook me as Macy did. I donated the book without finishing it."
2,Review of The Great Turning,"I am a progressive politically. I follow world events closely. This book leaves me very disappointed. Idealism, without substance.The Great Turning: From Empire to Earth CommunityDreaming of an idyllic community,is just not practical, in my view. There were good one-liner reviews of what is wrong with many aspects of the world , but no details of why the conclusion was made. The path to Earth Community is not spelled out enough for me to have much hope or interest in following it. Sorry.Max T. Nigh"
1,This movie stunk and is a disgrace to Fantasia,"The Neverending Story is my favorite movie. I thought that i would like part 2 as well. I saw it and hated it. It's not very much like the book, horrible acting (Bastian and his father), and the effects weren't as good as in the first. In the book, Xaxide is not a major charachter. On the back of the Auryn, it's supposed to say 'Do what you wish' (Atreyu didn't notice this because he can't read) so Bastian was supposed to wish even w/out a bird trying to pursuade him. Xaxide's powere is not supposed to make Bastian lose his memory, it is the power of the Auryn that does. Bastian is just really stupid in this movie. Watching this movie is a waste of your time."
1,PASS IT UP!,"BLEH! Although based on the second half of the original book, this movie hit rock bottom! Instead of wonderful fantasy, we were scared of the stupid bird and the evil queen! Not the gentle story we once knew! Too out of this world! If you wanna know what happens, just read the book instead of killing brain-cells on this flop!"
4,A fun sequel to the first movie.,"This is a fun sequel to the original movie. It's not as good as the first one, but it is still a lot of fun, and it covers some of the things that happen in the book that couldn't fit in the first movie (and honestly would have been great to put in a second book instead of having it all in one book)."
5,Great movie,One of the greatest movies since i was a kid. I bought this movie package for my son an he loves the movies as much as i do.
5,still lovin it,i read this book when i was about 10 and i saw the movie when i was 15. i loved it then and i love it now. my kids have a book and video library and every book i read and movie i ever saw is in that collection. they like most of the stuff i like mabey except dark crystal so much but never ending story is definetly a favorite.
5,It is absolutely riviting!,I definitely would want anyone to take advantage of this one! I enjoyed the part of asking the boy sebastian to get a name for the child-like-emperorous! I think this is very enjoyable and good for the minds who want fantacies!! END
1,Stupidest movie my daughter has ever seen,This is about the stupidest movie we have ever seen. It is so boring; it's not an adventure; there is no adventure in it. It isn't fun; Please do not watch this movie. It's too boring. (Dad typed the review while my daughter dictated the review)
2,Shoddy Sequel,"I've seen all the series and a book. First one is no doubt a masterpiece but second one is quite a failure. This is based on the second half of the story and has more important message than the first half where the first movie is based. According to the book Bastian is so charmed by fantasy world and keep making wish he forgets even who he is and how to get back to the world he belongs. This movie however is following similar steps to the first one (what is the difference between ""nothing and emptyness""?) forgetting what has to be done. Artrayu this series is closer to the book I think. Second one is more forgettable than the third which has tried original story. Because it is better to read a book. But Neverending Story has more future if the directors shed the effort to start from scratch. Let Miyazaki do the series."
2,Better see the first one,"This sequel is very bad. The director is not W.Peterson, and the result is just dull. Avoid this bad movie, and rewatch the first and only one Neverending story. Read the book, if you want. But do not watch this thing, or you'll regret it!"
5,Childhood classic,If you grew up in the 80's like I did then this movie is a must have! Shipping was prompt and it showed up still in the plastic wrapping.
4,First is Great - Second So-So,"My kid (8 years old) LOVES the Neverending Story. The second movie - eh - come on?! What happened to the original Atreyu? Anyhow - it's worth getting them both, since it's just as cheap as buying only the first movie. And, it was great to watch a movie from my childhood again - and have my kid love it too!"
1,Worst sequel EVER,"Ive loved the original Neverending Story since childhood. I still see it when it comes to the midnight movie showing in town.NES II is one of the all-time worst sequels to a great movie, that was ever produced! I couldnt even watch it all the way through, I think I stopped before it was half finished. It's PAINFULLY bad, low budget, the new characters are just dumb.. really, save yourself the disappointment. NES II doesnt even deserve to sit on the same shelf as Neverending Story, it's that bad."
3,Fun for Kids and Kids at Heart,I thought this movie was a little sinister at times but it turns out o.k. I liked the costumes. The special effects left a little to be desired. Over all it was enjoyable. The acting wasn't the best but young people don't seem to care as much about that.
2,CHECK YOUR DISC ASAP!,"I had the same problem as another review - the box has both movies on the cover, but when I watched it, I ended up getting the Widescreen and Full screen version of the first movie, and nothing for the sequel. Overall, the first movie is still great, but I was disappointed that I couldn't continue with the second"
4,The Neverending Glory,"Well, the second chapter of a great story. This movie is great yet it has some issues. Bastien is in more of the story this time and Artrayu is not. I guess thats a good thing being that he is nothing like the original. Nevertheless, it is a good movie, so calm down and buy it with the first one, and if your in a good mood buy the third."
1,never ending story,the dvd was broken when we opened it therefore we were unable to view it VERY disappointing!!! We were on a road trip to OK and I wanted my grandchildren to see this because their mother loveed as a child Too bad it was a failure!
1,As far as I'm concerned...,"This movie was never made. Hollywood has really turned into a sequel machine, and sometimes fans of an original movie who really love it just have to pretend that a sequel was never made.Case in point."
2,Should have left well enough alone.,"Even if you were able to tolerate the first one after reading the (fabulous) book, the fact that you could even make it through this one is beyond amazing. I walked out of the theater when Neverending II was first released, but thought that maybe it might just be my snobbish teenage mind - only to find out while giving this a second shot on DVD that is was as horrid as I remembered. If sequels must be made, at least *try* to find someone who looks like the orginal screen play characters. The acting is poor to say the least, the story patchy. They desperately tried to capture the magic of the book and the parts of the story line that were left out of the first movie. They failed. If you must watch a film version of this otherwise fantastic story, go with the 1st film. In this case, first times a charm. Anything else is a curse."
3,pretty good,"not as good as the original, but if your child enjoys the first film then they should enjoy this quite a bit as well. My 5.5 year old enjoyed both equally, though I still prefer the first."
4,nice,a nice follow up to the first one....the animations and the puppetry is fantastic just as in the first one
2,Not much to see here.,A little kid may like them. They're not that great for anyone old enough to drive.
2,Very Poor,"The original Neverending Story was imaginative, bold, and fascinating--and I loved every minute of it. Unfortunately, this sequel does it no justice. Mediocre acting and unimpressive (although elaborate) special effects don't do anything to add to the cliched and poorly construed plot. Children might find it enjoyable, though, just because it features child actors and lots of action. But the original is MUCH better, as I think even children would realize."
1,Yuck,"I first saw this in the theater when i was a kid... I thought it was terrible, and hardly comparable to the Original movie. Its pathetic really. Rent it if youre THAT curious about it"
2,The NeverEnding Story II,"The first film of the series had problems. This one had the same problems but many fold worse. Really bad dialoge, really bad acting."
2,Love the movie but...,"The movie is great. I loved it as a kid and ordered it for my kids to watch. The sound quality was very poor. The first 5 minutes of the movie we had to turn the TV (65"" ViZio LCD) up to 100 just to barely hear it! We usually watch movies at 19-23 on the volume. For the rest of the movie we had to turn it up for certain scenes and down for others. It was frustrating. I wish they would have done some sound quality work when they made it available on DVD. We only watched NES 1 so far. It was so frustrating that we haven't even attempted the 2nd movie yet."
2,BE CAREFUL!,"I recieved the movie combo on time and in the right condition. Unfortunately, instead of getting the double feature, I recieved the first NeverEnding Story on both sides of the disc. The one side was Widescreen, the other side Full Screen. The packaging is just as listed above with the double feature, but only one version :( Very Disappointing"
3,Second in the series,"This is the second in the Neverending Story series. It finishes up the sequences of the book that were left out of the first. Bastian has entered the book this time to help Atreyu and the Childlike Empress defeat Xyidia, sorry about the spelling. The cast is entirely different but there is more of an action feel to this movie than the last which was more sad and melancholy. Modern changes and 90s references have once more been added thanks to marketing strategies. God is nothing sacred! But anyway this film has some scary monstors that might give younger children nightmares so parents use caution."
4,The Evolution of the NES,"This sequel demonstrates the commitment to film-making growth in the Never Ending Story series. I highly recommend watching the Never Ending Story III before seeing this one though.I usually watch them in reverse order.And, if you play Dark Side of the Moon along with the movie (start the album right as the name of the movie appears on the screen) you'll be in for a real treat.George Miller really outdid himself here."
3,Movie for the kiddies......,"For all you NES fans out there (And I don't mean a Nintendo), you might be a bit disappointed. As is tragic with many sequels, it is hard to capture the magic from the original. While part 2 features the critters and main character from the first, I found it to be more geared towards the kiddies this time. It didn't seem as dark and sinister as the previous movie.However, all in all I had to give it 3 stars. Although not quite what I was hopeing for, it still provided the younger kids with entertainment while giving us older kids some much deserved peace and quiet :) So it ain't all that bad ;)"
1,Don't bother!,"Well, I loved the first one and so when the sequel came out I can to get it! Big Mistake! Instead of being imaginative and lovable, I found this movie crazy and harsh. Brandis did a great job as Bastian, but they wrongly chose Atreyu's actor! It seems as though he was younger than he was in the original. Just read the book, watch the original but don't bother with the sequel and 3rd!"
4,The Last Ones and a couple Unreleased...,"FINALLY, fans of the film Harold and Maude can have all the songs! With this release,if you're a Harold and Maude fan, you get the last of the songs from the soundtrackthat was never released in the U.S.Aside from that....this is a great selection of some of his tunes that include a fewthat were not released anywhere else but here at the time of this release.Wigwam was released in the U.S. as a single at the time the CD was released...they'dhave been better off and more successful releasing one of the lesser known tracks fromthe Harold and Maude soundtrack, even though Wigwam did recieve a quite a bit of radioplay, despite his change in religion stirring up controversy this collection did stillfare well with diehard fans. Wigwam did little on the charts after it's release."
4,"Songs from ""Harold and Maude""","Sometimes it's fun just to listen to ""happy"" songs--Victoria Williams, Tom Jones, The Monkees, and others. Cat Stevens also ranks as an artist who makes happy music. One of the top tracks of this variety is ""If You Want to Sing Out, Sing Out"", certainly the highlight anthem of the dark comedy ""Harold and Maude"", but it also features another selection from the film, ""Where Do the Children Play?"". Fans of Cat Stevens, happy music, and ""Harold and Maude"" will enjoy this CD."
5,"Peter's SECOND album, intense rock/pop album with two hits!","Includes the hits ""Glory of Love"" and ""Next Time I Fall"". Other songs include ""Big Mistake"", a very fast, jerky song with lots of electric guitar, it almost sounds angry, much like the title track ""Solitude/Solitaire"", obviously about his departure from the group Chicago. A very upbeat song, ""Wake Up To Love"", is also quick, and Peter's voice is very clear despite the instruments involved. Very intense album, passionate in many places. ""Daddy's Girl"" is quieter, and describes a little girl who will grow up and leave home, but she'll ""always be daddy's girl"". Very interesting collection of songs, mostly fast, features guitar, synthesizers and keyboards for that definite 'pop/rock' feel. Not at all like the group Chicago which he left the previous year, the songs take on their own meaning and have their very own life. A must for those who like special effects in their music combined with guitar!"
5,Peter Cetera brings back memories,"This recording is one of my favorite cd's. When I was little my Dad and I would sing ""Daddy's Girl"" in the car. Now he and I will dance to it at my wedding. ""Glory of Love"" and ""Next Time I Fall In Love"" are my other favorites on this cd."
4,Brings Back Memories,"I had been unable to find this album as an MP3 download so I was glad to be able to purchase it through Amazon. I had the original on cassette tape and now I'm glad to have the CD. This is a good mellow sounding album which has several worthy selections. ""Glory of Love"" is my favorite, but it also includes ""The Next Time I Fall"" and ""Only Love Knows Why"", both of which are Peter Cetera's trademark sound. The album will not disappoint."
2,Dude...what were you thinking?,"Just what was wrong with being the bass player for one of the greatest classic rock bands? Was it Cher? Dude, snap out of it! What would your mother say?"
1,WOOOOOOO that sucked,Dont get this game the sound is horrible and the graphics are even worse. the only good thing about this game is that there r alot of superstars.
4,Rise up with the Klezmatics!,"This is a wonderful album, although I don't think among their best. It is all worth it for the ""I ain't afraid"" title, both the first one in both Yiddish and English and the subsequent English recapitulation. I am so in love with it that I am going to present it to our Synagogue choir, of which I am a member, after the High Holydays. I would love to see it presented in Synagogues, Churches and Mosques, and everywhere people of good will, religious or not, are interested in peace and understanding."
5,Klezmatics rock!!!,"I purchased this CD for my mother-in-law who had hear the wonderful song, ""I'm Not Afraid"" on the radio. She was so taken with it that she asked me to find the CD. She has been listening to it non-stop; she says this CD has a bit of everything and loves every cut. Great condition, great price."
1,waste of money,"this product was by far the biggest waste of money that i have ever purchased. i'm sure that it would work fine, if the flash would mount into the hot shoe."
5,Amazing Training CD!,I am enjoying this set so much! I haven't made it to disc #4 yet - but I am having fun getting there! I love the narration and pointers along the way! Makes an inside workout so much more fun!
1,Better values elsewhere,Check the description before you buy. The price I paid was for a single packet. Don't assume that because the price is similar to what you might pay for 8 or 10 of these packets at your local grocery store that you are getting more than a single packet. That didn't pan out so well for me and I am returning the item.
2,It deserves at least 2 stars,I have the F27669 model and the guide is pure crap! It never keeps the right listing or channels. I'm always setting the proper channel to the correct station listing myself and it doesn't even download the listings itself anymore. I push guide and come to a screen asking me to select my listing setup most of the time. My circuit hardly ever trips so you can't say its because of power failures. The only things good about this TV is the S-Video and AV jacks since my last TV didn't have that or stereo sound.
5,Direct from the Twilight Zone,"Are you interested in this sort of thing? Try reading books about the Big Bang if you are having trouble with emptiness. Emptiness and bliss are the two main themes in this book. So what about bliss? I experienced bliss quite spontaneously after reading this book. I would not be able to repeat the experience, but I did experience it. Read this book and see what you think. At first , it seems like so much mumbo jumbo. It takes an empowerment to study this Yoga. Who knows? Perhaps you will sell all your material belongings and begin the path. Good luck!"
3,Nice phone.,"This is the second phone like this I purchased. First one died out after about 3 years. Bought another one because I had an extra battery on hand. Probably wouldn't have purchased otherwise. It does work okay around the house but limited range, but they tell you that upfront."
2,Lacks even modest range,"The right price - the wrong phone. I thought the low price reflected lack of bells and whistles (no caller ID, etc.) but found if I left the room where the base of the phone was located the signal clicked out.An old fashioned, long corded phone would work as well if not better. Don't be fooled that it is cordless - the range is no greater than a corded phone."
2,"Ok for $14, but not a great solution","This phone has been used in my house for over 2 years now. While I was almost happy with my $14 phone, I recently switched/upgraded to the Panasonic DECT phone (KX-TG1033S)and WOW I can tell the difference. No static interference, much better sound quality. The difference is like Hi-def TV to standard TV.If you talk your phone all the time, for the features, sound quality, and comfort, I would recommend springing for the Panasonic. If you hardly talk on your phone, this will suffice."
5,An 80s Classic--Great Music,"This album was one of the first CDs I bought for myself as an adolescent back in the late 80s--I loved it then and still do today. This CD presents a good balance of more upbeat songs and wonderfully dreamy slower songs, all written and performed by Suzanne Vega. ""Luka"", the second-track, is a great song, very 80s in style and feel, but without the ""tackiness"" that a lot of 80s music seems to have. ""In The Eye"" also has a head-bopping beat, but still doesn't stray from Suzanne characteristic melodic mood. ""Calypso"" is a notably pretty song and is one of my favorites from this CD. The only song I skip when it comes up is ""Gypsy"", which while a little too kitsch for my taste, is still far from a bad song. Overall, this album offers a good selection of great songs, some of them beautiful, with interesting lyrics, from one of the best artists of the 80s. This album has been one of my long-time favorites since I was a child, and I recommend it whole-heartedly."
1,terrible,"terrible, the one song that i ordered it for, was in a differant form. i threw it away an hour later."
5,Suzanne Vega CD Review,I highly recommend the cd - Solitude Standing - by Suzanne Vega. Each one of her songs tells a story and her voice is extremely soothing and very relaxing to listen to. Although this cd came out in 1987 - Her music still sounds as fresh as if it were released now. Each song draws youb into the story and you begin to visualize what Suzanne is singing about. Her voice can only be described as - soft - beautiful - clear - and completely mesmerizing. An absolute joy to listen to. You will never get tired of hearing this wonderful cd by the incredibly talented - Suzanne Vega.
5,Buy Tom's Album for the DNA Tom's Diner Remix; very cool cd.,"This was my first Suz. Vega cd and I think it is completely awesome. Like Self-Titled, it is extremely mellow and comforting. My fav. song has got to be Ironbound/Fancy Poultry, 2nd is Calypso, 3rd is Language. All the others tie for fourth. My only gripe is In the Eye. Ironbound always lures me to sleep at night and In the Eye always wakes me up because the contrast is so. . .loud. It may not be fair for me to say it's my fave disc, since I've had it longer, but I will anyway. No, the pop remix of Tom's Diner is not on this disc (sorry), but it is still well worth the cash. This should make for great lounging and study music. ckb"
5,It's all about Luka,"My life absolutely changed forever when i heard Luka for the first time on the radio. I thought, this is the absolute best song in the entire world! I asked my dad about who sang it, and two months later, I bout myself the CD for Christmas. Luka is still my most favorite song in the whole wide world- I know it so well, I can be reading or writing and sing every word without even concentrating. I LOVE THAT SONG! I didn't even know what it was about at first, and I think the concept is sad, but the tune is awesome and I only wish it was in a higher key because I'm a soprano."
1,Bland at best!,"Purchased the CD for my sister basically for Tom's Diner, but overall the entire album pretty much sucks. Not sure who likes this stuff, but she is monotone and boring to listen to. Also a side note, the CD has some type of protections on it, so I was unable to ""see"" it on my computer's CD/DVD drive. I've had this happen only once before, it is an annoying feature but I get why they do it."
1,mislead,"It was not said anywhere that the song Tom's Diner was in lyrics only, and that really sucks. It's not worth the time to send it back for $2."
4,Premonition of Great Things,"Dawn opens Dark Angel with a ripping take on Minnie Riperton's ""Reasons,"" recalling Dianne Reeves at her liveliest. A number of subsequent tracks contrast considerably, helped by the excellent vibes work of producer Joe Locke. Dawn's throaty alto is all musk and mystery, gliding through Phoebe Snow's ""Poetry Man,"" Charlie Chaplin's ""Smile,"" and Charles Mingus' ""Goodbye Pork Pie Hat."" Bob Berg's sax provides the relief, spraying splintered shafts of sunlight through Dawn's nocturnal explorations. Dawn has already performed for or with Nelson Mandela, George Benson, Abbey Lincoln, and Cassandra Wilson; Dark Angel is a premonition of great things. ****"
1,Playmate DVD,"I had to return this DVD collection because one of the discs was bad and wouldn't play, hence the single star. The viewable content was as expected. Had there not been a quality issue I'd have given 5 stars."
2,Defective dvd,One of the dvds is unplayable. I should have have watched them ALL sooner.I could not get a refund from Amazon. I am disappointed. Since the merchandise was NEW and from AMAZON I had not expected a problem. I Learned the hard way.
2,Unbalanced . . . Yet Eye-Opening,"Brings to the forefront many incidents showcasing modern anti-Semitism in Europe. But it's approach is incendiary and unbalanced, and in the wrong hands, this documentary could be used as a hate tool against Moslems. Still, sections are extremely eye-opening. Definitely should not be used as an educational tool for young minds who are approaching the topic for the first time."
5,"Great French Press, Flawless","This is a very high quality French Press. The plunger/filter fits snugly and slides with just the right resistance. No worry about broken glass, easy to clean, and my coffee is certainly tastier than with my Cuisinart automatic-drip. Even better, our electric tea kettle, also bought on Amazon:Cuisinart CPK-17 PerfecTemp 1.7-Liter Stainless-Steel Cordless Electric Kettlehas a French Press setting (~200F not 212F). So everything works and tastes great."
5,French Press that keeps the coffee warm for two hours,"I use a French Press daily for my morning coffee addiction. When I saw this Bodum French Press that advertised that it keeps the coffee warm for a couple of hours, I couldn't resist. It works great, the press is all one piece so I don't have to worry about losing parts, and it makes more cuos than my old standard press which has come in handy recently."
4,Bodum coffee press,I have broken at least a half dozen coffee presses over the years and finally got fed up and bought a stainless steel model. This press works great! No amount of dropping will damage it. The only small complaint is that it is not as insulated as I was expecting. The coffee gets cold in about the same amount of time as a glass press.
5,"Beauty, functional for every day","This pot isn't brain surgery - it's just a coffee pot that makes good quick coffee, same way, every time. I use it every day in my studio. It's simple, durable, great style and worth the price."
4,Best looking coffee press,"Really like the style. Easy to pour without spilling. Since the insulation isn't the best I suggest that you rinse the container with hot water before placing coffee grounds in. Also, be sure to keep the pot on some type of warm surface if you wish to keep the coffee hot for longer than 25 minutes."
2,Does Not Perform As Advertised,"We usually have a leisurely breakfast with a couple cups of coffee. Initial cup ok. Second cup, maybe 15 minutes later, warm, not hot. Thought the stainless steel feature would keep coffee warm as advertised. NOT so. Nice look, but too much $ for something that doesn't function as advertised!"
5,Fantastic Coffee,"I have used this press for about a year now and I like the coffee it makes so well that I bought a second one for our trailer. Once you have used pressed coffee it is almost impossible to go back to drip coffee, as it just doesn't have that ""zing"". This is the only press I have ever used so I really can not compare it to other presses. But this one works so well, with no grounds getting into the coffee that I can not imagine another type working any better. I would prefer a brushed stainless finish as it would require less maintenance and a 12 cup size would be a wonderful addition."
2,Spout drips,"I seldom use this unless I have company.Yes, it is elegant looking, but if you don't pour slowly, it drips. Very annoying."
3,OK,I have had this French Press for about 8 years now. It works very well as a french press but it does nothing for keeping the coffee hot. Also the fact that coffee grinds stay on the bottom and basically keep brewing while the hot water is still present makes the coffee almost undrinkable after a while. Maybe the best thing to do is get a dedicated thermos Pot and poor the finished French Press coffee into it to truly keep it hot and without continued brewing of leftover coffee.
2,expensive + weaker replacement plunger plate,"The plunger replacement part called the ""cross plate including silicone ring"" (part and shipping=$21!) has thinner and weaker silicone than when this press was originally produced. Expect to get only 8 months of use out the new version- versus over 2 years for the original one. Other than that, it's a very good press...but we won't be using ours anymore."
5,A French Press That Will Last a LIFETIME!!! (or a very long time),"This is the 5th French Press I have purchased in three years. I have always purchased the glass types, as these were the most cost efficient and did the job perfectly. The issue was that any time the glass press was knocked, it would either crack or shatter!! (I've broke 4 like this!) This Stainless Steel French Press will not crack like glass french presses. The press is made very well and should last a lifetime! The press is also easier to clean than glass ones (to fully clean a glass french you must remove the glass cylinder from the holder). The coffee stays warmer 10X longer which is great when you have company or want to enjoy multiple cups. Best coffee maker I have owned ever!! 5 Stars!!"
2,Dissapointed,"Having read all the wonderful reviews about how great coffee presses are and this press, I found making coffee with it to be very step-intensive, and to take a LOT longer to make coffee than just using a drip coffee maker. Also, I never read anything about how messy it would be to try and dig the grounds out of the pot to throw away with your hand using paper towels. I seem to always be spilling grounds around my kitchen. The coffee is delicious, but it takes too much time with too many steps, clean up is messy, and yes, the coffee does not stay hot. I wish I had not wasted my money on this product."
2,I'm dissapointed,"bought this Thermal Press Pot to replace one, of another brand, that had bit the dust after many years of faithful service. The old pot would easily keep my coffee hot for an hour, with this one after ten minutes the coffee is warm at best. The pot is thermal, but the lid is not. Also you have to be extemely careful not to dribble while pouring."
2,8-Cup---- NOT EVEN CLOSE,This will just be a short comment on this otherwise excellent press. This only fills two of my average size coffee mugs.... no where near 8 cups it advertises. The only other slight problem is the lid is so thin you loose a lot of heat threw it.
3,"Good, but not great","Three stars because of the claim by Amazon that it keeps coffee hot for up to two hours. You'll be lucky, even with preheating, to keep it hot for 30 minutes. It's a one-piece metal pot and the heat travels fast in metal. But, if you use excellent beans, you'll get excellent coffee. Of course, any coffee press will result in sediment in your cup. You have to live with that if you want french press coffee."
1,Very disappointed,"A very disappointing product! I pre-heated the pot, used 220 degree hot water and by the time I drank the first cup the coffee in the vacuum pot was too cool to drink. Returned it."
3,Some like it Hot,"Looks great, but does not make hot coffee due to design flaw. Do not buy.Addendum: The only way I can comprehend that someone would give this unit five stars would be if there was something wrong with the unit I got! After five minutes of brewing, the coffee was already not hot anymore - even if I tried to preheat it with boiling water before adding coffee and new boiling water. And because the water cools down so fast the coffee was too weak for my taste. I used a Bodum glass press for several years until it broke and I bought this one, and that unit made steaming hot, strong, wonderful coffee."
5,Bodum Stainless Steel Thermal Coffee Press,If you love coffee then you will love this product. Pot keeps coffee hot for at least 1 hr. Thats plenty of time for me! Taste is much better than drip. Easy to use and no big clunky coffee maker to use up space on your counter. Looks great too! Very happy with my purchase!
1,mine must be defective,"I bought this because of rave reviews and a good concept. I wish I could send it back to Bodum and ask them what were they thinking. I am so disappointed. Poor thermal quality, makes a leaky mess unless poored slowly and at just the right angle.. It needs a gasket to prevent leaks and seal in the heat. I just get a better cup out the old time glass carafe."
3,"Nice, but won't keep coffee hot","Its a really nice stainless press and we won't have to worry about breaking it like our previous glass presses. However, it is not a true double-walled insulated container like a thermos. The top does not seal and is very thin, which adds to the heat loss. We make the coffee and if we are not drinking it immediately we pour it into another insulated container.Also, the plunger is not all metal as the description says. It is plastic with a metal mesh and a silicon seal around he edge. Works great, but it is a concern for people that don't want the plastic in contact with the hot liquids.Overall I like it and am satisfied that we will be able to use it for a long time, but I am dissappointed that it is not really insulated."
2,redundant,"this seems like a bad idea if you like french press pot coffee. The whole point is to get the brew away from the grinds once it is ready. The best way to do that is to immediately transfer what you aren't drinking to a thermos or insulated carafe. Leaving the brew in contact with the grinds is not a good idea. On top of that a plastic plunger?? Yes, the glass carafes on the classic Bodum models sometimes break, as one reviewer pointed out, but this happens less as one gets used to it and at the price, still cheaper than any other method of brewing and a far superior product results."
4,just like downtown...,We found the French press method of brewing coffee to really enhance the flavor of a cup of coffee. The design and finish of the pot were excellent.
5,Fantastic!,"This is a fantastic addition to my kitchen. It very nice looking and makes the best pot of coffee I've had in years. Easy to clean and keeping the shine doesn't seem like it's going to be a problem. I just ordered the cream and sugar set to go with it. I've been through 3 coffee makers in the past three years and they just seem to fall apart. That is not going to happen with this great pot.Now, it doesn't keep coffee hot for nearly as long as I will often let it set but it does stay hot for much longer than the usual glass press. I also found that if I just toss a dish towel over it that it will stay hotter a bit longer. Then it's a good habit not to make more than you intend to drink in a two hour period."
3,Not what I was hoping for,"My purchase of the Bodum SS Thermal Press Pot came on the heels of breaking yet another glass for my french press.The Bodum seemed like a good alternative and indeed I don't think I will break it anytime soon. However, it does notlive up to some of my other expectations.Even if I put boiling water into the pot to heat it up before making coffee, it still does not keep coffee hot foras long as I would like. Granted in this regard it has an edge over a glass french press but it doesn't come close to the heatretention of a good Nissan (or other brand) thermos.I also find that the plunger can be very difficult to push down if the grounds have not been given sufficient time tosettle. I don't always want to wait that long. One other minor complaint is that it is at times prone to dripping while pouring."
5,Bodum thermal press is great!,"A friend uses these for her catering business and recommended them. We use it every day! Just perfect for a large mug of coffee and enough to take ""to go"" to work where they have nasty coffee! Love it! Seals well. If you heat the thermos with hot water while you're boiling the coffee water, it stays hot for several hours. But who lets good french press coffee sit that long. Also nice for when a friend comes for coffee/dessert. Pretty enough to set on the table."
3,Echos the common complaint...,"The pot is stylish, well-crafted, and makes tasty coffee, which, with a press, is frankly easy to do. The silicon ring around the base of the plunger is a nice feature which our earlier iterations of Bodum press-pots lacked.The thermal pot is decidedly ineffective. I would describe it not so much as keeping coffee warm, as retarding the cooling process somewhat. After an hour in the pot, the coffee was lukewarm and unappetizing. This press is no substitute for a good old-fashioned thermal carafe with a screw lid.I would rate this more highly that a conventional press, primarily because my wife and I have broken so many glass carafes over the years. But at the price...well, you'll have to decide for yourself."
1,Plastic piece inside - product made in China,"I ordered this coffee press after looking at many online. It is beautiful; however, I would not use it for coffee. The product was listed as stainless steel. The part inside was part stainless and part plastic. With all of the health issues regarding plastics and food nowadays, one wonders why plastic would be used inside a boiling hot coffee pot. I returned it and bought a Frieling instead. It is also made in China, but the parts inside are completely stainless steel."
1,misleading,"The product is described as made of stainless steel. However, be aware that the plunger is mostly plastic. I wanted to specifically avoid plastic for brewing hot tea due to health concerns, and from the description of this product expected it to be stainless steel. It is described incorrectly and the description of press mechanism material needs to be added.I used it only once; tea stayed hot for less than 15 min. and did not taste well (plastic).Big disappointment. Needless to say, I'm returning it."
5,Great Coffee Press,"I find myself getting excited about a good cup of strong coffee. I have found a French press to be a great way to accomplish a good cup at home. I have had several different kinds of presses over the years. This is the best I've ever owned. I have been using for several months and just love it. The press itself fits tight and works great. The fact that it is a thermal carafe is very helpful. I prime it with a little boiling water and it keeps coffee warm for several hours. It is easy to clean. So far, it has been very durable. I have broken every glass press I've owned. I can't seem to break this one. Pricey but worth it. I would purchase this same model/brand again."
4,Very nice,"Very happy with this purchase - coffee comes out tasting delicious because its a french press, no glass to break (like my last one)and easy to clean. Only wish it was bigger - like a 12 cup size."
3,French Press Coffee Maker,"The only reason I wouldn't give this a 5 star is that some of the internal plunger/filter apparatus was made of plastic. Our reason for purchasing this item was to get away from plastic parts in our coffee maker. Our glass French press had all stainless steel parts (also from Bodum), fortunately these parts were interchangeable so we merely retired the plastic parts, along with the old glass pot, and now our coffee is plastic free and the Stainless-Steel Thermal Press works GREAT!"
5,Worth the price.,"All the features of other Bodum press-pots, but this keeps the coffee (or tea!) warm longer. Stainless steel carafe is attractive and cleans up easily. Built to last."
3,Stainless Steel coffee press,this is a very nice coffee press however we returned it for a different one because my husband wanted the internal parts to be all stainless steel and this has a plastic press.
3,"Good as a maker, not so good as a thermos","I really like the pot as a french press. Cool design. Cool aesthetically. Unfortunately the coffee does cool down very quickly. So if you're thinking you're getting a good deal with this seemingly two-for-one (like I did) you will be disappointed. Even after warming the carafe before brewing, the coffee only stayed a drinkable temperature for a half-an-hour or so."
2,Pouring is a pain,"I got this because I broke a glass press pot on our granite countertop. This one does not break; that is the good news. My problem with this one is that when I pour, I get perhaps 2/3's of the coffee out. Then it stops or pours out very slowly. I tip it back upright, swirl it around, pour again. I repeat that process several times in order to get most of the coffee out. That, as they say, is a pain. I plan on moving back to the glass beaker form and being a little more careful."
3,"Great idea, doesn't quite deliver","I loved this idea - my only complaint about my glass french press was the cooling off factor. However, this doesn't keep the coffee HOT, it keeps it warm. This morning, when I went to pour my second cup about 30 minutes after I brewed the coffee, it needed about 30 seconds in the microwave. Also, when I pour quickly, the spout somehow leaks or isn't designed quite right because a large puddle forms on the counter. This 8-cup model makes two large mugs of coffee."
5,this coffee press is wonderful,This is my first time using a coffee press and decided to go with the stainless bodum. It is incredible. No bitterness or after taste. I used organic coffee and it was the best I've had. It seems like a very pure way to make coffee. I've also used it to make Raja's Cup which is a herbal antioxidant coffee substitute and it was the best. This press is very precise and just works beautifully. I push the filter down vary slowly without much pressure and no grinds make their way in. I will try it using tea next. For this price of $29.99 it is a bargain and the only way I will make coffee from now on.I just made some herb tea and the flavor and richness is incredible. The clean up is easy too.
3,Elegant but no better than the $20 glass version,"I've used french presses for years. But this news junkie wants more than one cup in the morning and the second cup from a regular press is disappointingly lukewarm. (Nuking it destroys the flavor!) I thought this sleek-looking stainless version might do the trick instead of shifting coffee to a thermos right after making it in the glass press. The claim this press will keep coffee hot for 2 hours is simply preposterous, but I'd take even a half hour. This pretty little gizmo truly doesn't keep the coffee any hotter than a glass carafe, even when you pre-warm it. At $80 it flat out should be a miracle, since you can get a top of the line thermos for less than that. My advice? Save your money and get a regular press."
5,A Superb Coffee and Tea Press!,"This 8 cup coffee press from Bodum is the best coffee pot I have ever owned! I have gravitated toward electric coffee makers in the past, and was ready to try something new. This pot is perfect for brewing coffee or tea. The coffee has a smooth and rich taste, unlike the coffee made with electric machines. It also keeps the coffee or tea hot for at least 45 minutes without any bitter after taste. It is the perfect size for one or two people, and clean up is so easy. Plus, the design is very elegant! I highly recommend this coffee press for anyone looking for an alternative to electric coffee makers."
4,Much better than the glass version,I bought this because I kept breaking my glass press. I LOVE this one. Much nicer looking and easier to clean and take care of. I suggest hand cleaning the press and running the actual container in the dishwasher.
4,plastic plunger,"Great pot, well made - although comes from China. Bodum indicates 100% stainless construction, but the strainer and the filter have polycarbonate/metal parts. I swapped out my stainless plate/cross/mesh filter from my 8 cup Chambord, and I'm pleased as punch."
4,Like it very much - So far...,"My title is due to writing an very good review for the Nissan thermos insulated french press, then after owning it for a year changed my mind, but thats another review! anyway, So far so good. It seems to keep coffee hot for as long as we need it to be and there are no grounds in the coffee. My only suggestion would be a little sturdier top. Its a little cheesy compared to the rest of the pot. I am Very happy with the rubber gasket around the mesh screen - but we'll see how long and well that works...."
5,Coffee Press,"Having used the glass version for several years and suffering with warm second cups of coffee, I decided to opt for this thermal pot. It does a great job of keeping the coffee hot for the second cup. It will definitly not keep hot for ever, but for the 15 -20 minutes it takes to drink the first cup, it is still real hot! I and my wife are very happy with this product."
5,Great Coffee,When I bought this for my wife for Christmas I was not sure how well she would like it because I didnt know anyone that had one. Well she loves it and so do I. She drinks more coffee than me and really appreciates good coffee. She is now telling me that we need to store our auto drip coffee maker (that is considered as a good one) and just use the French Press. You can even make coffee faster. If you love great coffee do yourself a favor and get one.
4,Good product but not a good deal,"I absolutely love the thermal pot. It's much prettier than the regular glass carafe french press. I had been looking for one for some time and was excited to find it on Amazon. Unfortunately, I found it later at Bed Bath and Beyond for $10 cheaper so I was disappointed in the price.It keeps the coffee warmer, but not hot. After some time I still need to warm it up."
5,Great so far,"This was purchased as a gift. They have been using it almost daily for a few weeks and are very happy with it. I can't compare it to any other press pots, because this is the first we have used. It is attractive and holds enough for three big cups of (very tasty) coffee."
2,"Was thrilled with this item, until...","...my coffee started tasting terrible for no apparent reason. Then I realized that a small crack had developed inside near the spout, which allowed water/coffee to get in the hollow space between the two stainless steel walls. Since there is no way to completely drain the liquid out, it has become putrid. Every time I've been pouring coffee recently, a small amount of this nasty-tasting stuff has been pouring out along with it. Not only am I disgusted, but it makes me wonder about the quality/composition of the so-called ""stainless steel"", if it can crack/erode so easily. For the price and apparent quality, I really expected it to last longer than the 3 years I've had it. It's always been hand-washed (even though it says it is dishwasher safe) and generally well cared for. I'm revising my original 5 star rating down to 2 stars."
5,Unbreakable,"I bought the Bodum Columbia after noticing cracks in the bottom of the its predecessor's glass beaker (and not its first predecessor either). The brewing time required by a French press results in ""cooler"" coffee as a matter of course compared to a regular coffee maker, but, at 5,280 feet in altitude, the water is not that hot in either case. I used an insulated container for the extra coffee in the old glass beaker press to keep it hot for a short period time which the Columbia will do, too. I have to say that I bought the Columbia at Sur La Table for $80 which is comparable to the Amazon price (""marked down"" from $107)."
2,short of my expectation,"If this coffee press works charm like other reviewers said, all the coffee makers producing the other types of coffee machine and paper filer could have closed already. How coarse I grind coffee, the provided filter in the plunger cannot filter out some finely-ground coffee. By the way, I used Krups burr coffee grinder. After I drink the coffee, bitter taste is lingering, and I feel nauseated, and sometimes my heart is palpitated. I even tried to re-filter the filtered coffee using paper filter, but it is stuck quickly. A major disappointment."
5,thermal carafe coffee press,The stainless carafe is handsome and does an adequate job of keeping 8 cups of coffee warm. Works just like the typical glass press but much safer.
4,Good choice,"I purchased the Bodum 34-oz Thermo Press with truck camping on my mind; light weight, unbreakable and durable. Although, it did take some practice to get the ""just right"" result, I am very happy with my purchase."
5,Awesome Camp Coffee,"We have travel trailer but often camp where there is no electricity. Stove-top percolators just boiled the coffee. The 8-cup pot gives me two+ big mugs of great-tasting coffee and the second cup is hot without being 'scorched'. If you have more than one or two coffee drinkers, I'd consider the 12 cup pot."
1,My pot broke within 2 years,"I initially bought this pot because I had trouble with breaking my glass bodums. What better than a stainless steel pot that will last many years.Sadly enough, my pot only lasted 18 months before developing a leak on the inside towards the bottom. I only hand washed it, and only used it to make coffee.Why would a stainless steel pot like this break within 2 years? Bodum didn't know either, but informed me that there isn't a warranty on the pots for this amount of time.Although it is stainless steel, my pot broke in a very very short time. Shouldn't a pot last longer than 2 years, especially if it is stainless? And why doesn't it have a warranty? Why did I spend fifty dollars to have my pot break after 2 years?Bodum, you need to work on your pots and your warranty!!!!!"
2,The plunger inside made of plastic!,"You would think a pot described as Stainless-Steel would be made of all Stainless-Steel! Well, not quite. A portion of the lid is made of plastic, and the press/plunger itself is made of plastic spokes, with a big rubber ring.I don't like to have boiling hot beverage come into contact with plastic. Nowhere in the pictures or description is plastic mentioned. I seldom return products, but this one is going back.If one does not mind the plastic parts inside, buy this product. If you want an all stainless French Press, buy the Frieling. The Frieling pot/lid/plunger/filter are all stainless."
4,French pressure,"we purchased this product because both my wife and i developed quite a knack for breaking the glass presses. this metal press is working very well, we're very happy with it. it even keeps the coffee warm for quite some time without making it bitter. it's even managed to survive our clumsy ways!"
4,Bodum SS French Press Pot very good but!,"This was my second french press coffee pot. The first was a cheap knock off, but made excellent coffee. However, it rusted very quickly so I researched this style of coffee makers and found the all stainless steel model made by Bodum. The price was half of anywhere else on Amazon and free shipping to boot. The item seems to be very well made and the pot itself is stainless steel. The lid may be stainless (thinner material) and the innards are plastic and metal. It makes excellent coffee and does keep the coffee hot for a little while longer than the other un-insulated model I had. The length of time it keeps the coffee hot is not very good, thus the 4 stars. So far so good...bye the way don't buy cheap coffee beans and use a burr grinder, you will be well rewarded."
5,"Wonderful, hot coffee!",Great product! My coffee is hot instead of cold like the other French press coffee makers. Highly recommend!With the thermal pot there is no risk of breaking the glass too.
4,Great Thermal Press Pot,"Wonderful appearance, sturdy and holds temperature reasonably well. It can be used for brewing both coffee and tea. Easy to clean and very comfortable to handle. However, heat still leaks out from the pot walls., i.e. there are insulation flaws in the design. For an excellently-designed thermal pot, heat can only leaked out from the top (i.e. where insulation is the least effective)."
4,good looking and functional,*The Good - A very easy to use and dependable press. *The Bad - Even though I preheat the pot with boiling water first it still doesn't keep the coffee hot for more than 20 minutes. We use it when we have company and serve the coffee immediately.
2,Won't Break- But Tips Over,"I, like most, have went through glass carafe after glass carafe and turned to this alternative. Great concept- poor design. It has tipped over on my counter several times causing a nasty coffee mess to go allover! With so many other designs out there, no need to have this potential mess in your kitchen."
4,Wonderful Novel from a tremendous Author,"A young man, who aspires to become a writer in Warsaw in 1922 gets caught up in issues of life, love, family, and politics. The times are chaotic and the future is uncertain. Social structures are changing, religon is under assault, and communism is on the rise.This is the background for this novel by nobel prize winner Isaac B. Singer. This largly autobiograpichal story paints a picture of a culture and time lost in the ashes of history. His memories are touching and deftly written. A good read for any who are interested in this tremendous author."
1,tom chapin review,Tom Chapin entertains all age groups. His happy birthday tune on the Moonboat cd is especially memorable.The cd is an easy gift that will be taken out for every birthday and in between can be used to entertain cranky children and uplift tired spirits.
1,questionable quality,"Item advertised in sealed blisterpack...arrived loose in unmarked box..can't determine if used, purchased as a backup for dive computer, can't test till needed.Emailed seller and they were sorry I was disappointed..not much satisfaction from that response."
5,"Great product, better than expected","This battery arrived in record time in original packaging. Shelf life as printed on battery is 2016, plenty of life left (at writing 4+ years). I checked the voltage before installation and it was fully charged with proper current output. You always have to worry that for a good price that you're getting some kind of ""seconds"" product but from what I can tell this is not the case (with this product from this seller). Installed for a couple of months with excellent output to date. Highly recommended for the price and I'll purchase again without hesitation. I noted that other purchasers received product that was not in original blister pack and I expect this is a vendor issue. I purchased from ""Ocean Discount"" and very happy with the purchase..."
3,Light hearted reading-a bit verbose at times.,"I passed the first time, and i consider myself very lucky. However, i can certainly say it won't happen if you only read this book. There is a lot of good information in this book, but it is verbose and full of facts irrelevant to the exam. The main problem with most books is that their practice tests and exams don't really help you answer any real exam questions. I also used the exam cram series book to help supplement this book, which is great for reviewing thet material. Good luck."
1,This book sucks,"This book is a joke. When you compare the content of the book and the writing style of this author (Anil Desai) with the much more throrough content and superior writing style of an accomplished author such as Mark Minasi, it becomes apparent that some authors (like Desai) write simply to fill pages, while others actually write to fill pages with USEFUL and PRACTICAL knowledge. I'm just getting into Chapter 3 and so far I've learned absolutely nothing. Go ahead and buy this book, study it, and when you walk out of the exam room having failed miserably, you'll think to yourself, ""Did I buy the right book?"" That is the difference between the questions that will be given to you on a Microsoft exam, and the content of a book like this. Do yourself a favor -- try a different book."
3,Really don't know,"I couldn't get metric like I ordered, so I decided to buy a J H Williams set..JH Williams is made in Taiwan, I wish I had gone to the trouble of straightening out my order for these."
5,Still made in the USA sold by Amazon,These combination wrenches are a great buy for the price and they're still made in the USA. I was a little worried about purchasing them since they are now are owned by ideal but they seem to still be top notch. I am slowly converting my tool collection over from craftsman since they started to make their tools in china. People really need to look at where their tools are made and make an effort to support American manufacturing. Sk tools may be slightly higher priced than craftsman but it is well worth the few extra bucks. I've also read that some people are not happy with the warrantee since ideal took over but when was the last time a hand tool really failed when it was used properly? Don't hesitate to purchase an SK tool I would highly recommend them the fit and finish are exceptional for the price.
5,Good Audio Course,"This is not an in-depth course, which is a good thing. It is focused on audio learning and speaking Chinese.I ripped the tracks and put them on my digital music player (I ripped them in .ogg format, that is why I don't call it an ""mp3 player) so I can listen to them anywhere.It does not explain grammar in detail, which may be a good thing. By itself, it will give a good introduction to speaking Chinese. With other resources (for learning grammar, characters and vocabulary), it is a good audio supplement."
1,Bohm deserved better,"I can say, without question, that Peat's biography is a disappointment. The book's only redeeming characteristic is that Peat makes ample use of interviews that would otherwise be unavailable or nonexistent. In other areas, however, Bohm is not well represented. Peat uses information obtained from Russell Olwell concerning Bohm's case before HUAC. Unfortunately, Peat corrupted much of Olwell's work and presented an inaccurate picture of Bohm's case. Further, Peat fails to fully explore the impact of Bohm's work in the foundation of quantum physics and his alternative interpretation. In his review of the book Dr. James Cushing wrote that Bohm deserved better. Sadly, Dr. Cushing is correct."
4,Gospel Store owner,"As a store owner i will love to sell this product in my store, if i can get this product or any thing by Juanita, my customers in Trinidad & Tobago will be very happy .At presant there are no distributor for the people of the Caribean.Please to Management give me wholesale prizes and i will bless the hearts through the ministry of Juanita Bynum. Thank you and God bless you richly. Please e-mail me or give me a call at #868-653-8560"
2,New to Blue October. Music not what I expected,"I just wanted to write a review from a newbies standpoint. My first taste of Blue October's music was with their newest CD Foiled. I LOVE it and was very excited to get another. I purchased Argue With A Tree based on all the rave reviews it got and I was really dissapointed. The music was harsher and not as complex as the music on the Foiled CD. A lot of yelling/swearing unappealing crowd noise. Anyway, I know die-hard Blue October fans are going to hate my review but for those of you who LOVED Foiled this is just a warning that you might not like Argue With A Tree."
5,Great Series,"This was a great series!Some saw the Waltons as too ""goody too shoes"". I disagree. The acting was good and it is excellent family programming.Kids can learn a lot from this show, a lot of lessons about character and staring adversity in the face and overcoming it."
4,Great Family TV,"This is a great series to watch. The only reason I didn't give it a fifth star, is that the dvd does not have any extras that you expect from a dvd. It would have been nice to see, different languages, outtakes, commentaries and biogrphies of the actors, and commentaries and biographies of the real family that this series is roughly based on by Earl Hamner. But I still highly recommend this dvd for quality TV watching. Lets hope that when they release season two, they will inclde more extras."
4,Walton's Season 2,The Season 1 and Season 2 DVD set is just what my in-laws wanted. They are finicky TV watchers and many of todays shows are not of interest to them. They absolutely love the DVD's and thank me for them everytime I see them.
4,GREAT SHOW...BUT WHERE ARE THE EXTRAS?,"The Waltons is a show that I never ever watched as a kid. It just wasn't something I thought I would like. I found these shows on TV in the early 90'. I was very surprised how quickly I became a fan! I really only like the the first 5 years,but it is a great show and I have bought the seasons as the are released. I just wish there were some sort of bonus material.:-("
2,great content but problems with product,"We love the program itself. Great family entertainment. However, the set had 2 disk 3's and no disk 1. So we didn't have the first 6 episodes. When we contacted Amazon, they said that they can't replace the disk or even the set. They will just give us a refund if we return it. We are currently living in Mexico and purchased this in the US on a visit. So trying to return the product is a problem. It's too bad that there isn't a better way to work with us on the issue."
1,Disc Information Missing In Product Description,These discs were purchased for a library. No where in the product description does it state that the episodes are on both sides of the discs. We are unable to put security or markers on the discs. If I had known I would not have bought this set.
5,REAL TV,A show that was not PC and wasn't worried about what less then 5% of america didn't want to hear. I love this show for talking about GOD and his only begotten son JESUS. This is a true family show that you can not find on today TV. Shows these days and times don't have the guts to show true family value for being scared to offend a handful of left wing nuts. ORDER YOU A COPY OF ALL 9 SEASONS TODAY-YOU WON'T BE SORRY.
4,The Waltons: The Complete First Season,Had this sent to my father for a Christmas gift. He received it before I got a chance to tell him it was arriving. Didn't expect him to get it so quickly. Would have given it 5 stars but not sure of the quality of the DVD since I did not see it. I would definitely purchase a DVD again.
1,DVD cracked,"I am certain that the programs are good, but the first DVD in the series is cracked! They are to be played on both sides, so unless Amazon or someone can replace it, We have lost 6 episodes. I hope the rest will be OK. I handle DVDs very gently alhtough I know they are supposed to be practically indestructable...."
1,DVD's ARE JUNK SERIES IS AWESOME,"I love the Waltons ever since I was a kid. I finally brought myself to purchase the entire series in one swoop. To my dissapointment, virtually every dvd is of such poor quality design that the episodes skip around or don't play at all. They came scratched and damaged with broken cases. I was hoping it would be limited to the first season, but well into season 4 of viewing it only gets worse. One whole side of disk 3 season 4 would not play at all. I am sending back the entire series for a refund with much regret, but I am not paying for a product that will not perform. Whoever made these DVDs on the cheap should be ashamed. Shame on Amazon for not listening to me when I made a call to complain. Others will have to suffer as a result. I hope to purchase this series again in the future, with quality dvds."
5,A perfect gift,"I purchased ""The Waltons complete first season"" as a gift for a friend. She loves the Waltons and was very happy to receive this as a perfect birthday gift. I plan to supplement her DVD library with further editions of the Waltons in the near future. It was a hit with her, and I am glad I finally found something to make her this happy. If you have someone in your life who is a Waltons fan, follow my advice and buy them the series!"
5,Good Wholesome Entertainment,"The Waltons is the type of show you can let your children watch and not worry about them hearing any racy or sexually suggestivelanguage. My wife, three under-10 year old children and myself watched all 24 episodes of season one in five weeks time, and we did it in an unusual way: we reserved every Sunday as a ""Waltons Day"" and watched five shows throughout the day. I hadn't seen the shows since I was a kid and they brought back a lot of memories."
3,Faulty Recordings,"The Walton series itself is delightful, as always. What I have found, and seems to be an increasing problem, is the quality of the recordings. More and more I find the discs to be faulty where only part of an episode can be viewed."
3,GREAT SHOW,"GREAT SHOW BUT DAMAGE TO THE LAST DISC...DID NOT NOTICE UNTIL I WENT TO PUT IT IN TO WATCH...MY STUPIDITY WAS TO LATE TO RETURN, SO I JUST HAVE TO DEAL WITH IT OTHER THAN THAT THE OTHER 4 WERE GREAT."
5,The Waltons - The Complete First Season,We purchased this to own a review of many past good memories of the shows. Just exactly what we wanted!
1,"yet another glaring oversite, no english subtitles","In what must have been a production error, ( seems to be common on way to many dvd's )the subtitles are in French only. There are no English subtitles.Obviously someone at Warners Home Video has made a bad mistake in production. This makes it difficult for any elderly viewers or hard of hearing that might want to watch this show. ( um hey, guess what, they have money to spend, too! ) Are you HEARING that?Subtitles are supposed to be standard on all DVD box sets and I note that overseas versions of The Waltons have corrected this mistake(just not the American version).This is getting to be old hat by now. I have some dvd's that are 10 years old that are CC. just flat lazy and ignorant decisions.The Deaf and hard of hearing are the last ""group"" in the USA to still be looking for they're rights. Everyone else has recieved them in the last 50 years. How long is this going to go on??No Good Night John Boy in this house."
4,Walton -the Complete Frist Season,This is just great to watch. Loved reliving the memories when the Walton's first came out. Definitely for the whole family to sit down together and watch.
3,your mistake,"I received my order for The Waltons Season 1 on time. Great service there,however, I must inform you that the first disc was labeled disc 1 and supposed to contain Episode1: The Foundling, Episode 2 The Carnival ,etc. Instead it contained Episode 13 The Reunion, Episode 14, The Minstrel, etc. Disc 3 and all the others were as they should be. Will you send me the proper disc 1 for this series please?Thank YouLinda Lytle"
3,Waltons 1st season,"Nice collection of shows, Video quality is ok, but not the best. I also had some issues with one of the stories (the hunt) where the video keeps stopping and starting during the story, about 1/4 of the way in."
5,walton's 1st season,I gave this as a gift to someone who loves the television show and she was very pleased. She said it was in excellent condition and has decided to start a collection of all of the seasons. The order arrived promptly and in the condition promised. I am pleased with the item.
5,Great family show!,"Gave this to my mom for Christmas since she loved the show growing up. She said she loves it and she pulls it out every once in awhile to watch with my dad. Good, clean family show. You don't have to worry aboutyour kids seeing sex, drugs, or violence in this show!"
3,Great show but faulty DVD discs,"The Waltons is one of those series which is really timeless and universal (though set in a specific time and place). In our present age of pandering to the lowest common denominator with explicit sex and violence, it is so refreshing and uplifting to watch a family coping with the hardships of life in a positive and insightful manner.That said, I really must complain about the technical quality of these 2-sided DVDs. I have had to return two seasons (this Season One included) because of faulty reading, tracking, whatever, causing the picture to break up and stop playing. PLEASE look into the technical quality of this fine TV series and correct the faults!"
5,EXCELLENT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I have fond memories of the Waltons but it is pure joy to watch these shows again. Great alternative to the lousy fair on television these days. Our whole family has been enjoying this set. Probably will get the rest of the seasons eventually.
1,Poor quality,I bought a new DVD player thinking my old player was over. The problem was the quality of the disc. Very poor.I could deal with the poor quality film but not the constant skipping and screen breakup. BOO whoever made this product.
5,Great Series,"This timeless series is great for the whole family. We watch an episode and then discuss it as a family. A great way to open up discussion within the family. Not only entertaining, but uplifting and educational. One of the greatest TV series ever."
3,damaged,The order arrived in good time. I have watched four discs so far. The first two discs had glitches in the first episode on side A and on side B. I had to skip those sections and miss part of the episodes.
4,"wholesome, clean shows","good, old-fashioned wholesome, clean shows. If you are interested in the depression era and how your grandparents, or parents, had to live, this is a good family show that the whole family will enjoy.Picture quality at its best, original theme music, worth the price."
2,The Waltons first seasom,The Programs are good except the the first two DVDS in this series are not copied real good in that the sound track is off on the first part of these DVDs. The rest of the programs in this series are good.
5,Family Entertainment,"No, it doesn't have all the extras, but if you just want to watch a good family show without sex, profanity, or violence, this is for you."
1,Why?????,"While I'm so glad I bought this great series. I'd like to know who's not so bright idea was it to have the set as double-sided discs??? Did they realise that the discs are prone to scratching??? As I have found out with another Dvd. I only hope that the remaining series are not in the same format, otherwise I won't be buying them.I may have rated it 5 stars but I give it a minus 1 for the format alone.PS I haven't bought the other seasons, they are all flippers or double sided, what fooooooools!!!!"
4,Easy to read and creepy at the same time!!!!,"As anyone can tell you...being threatened or stalked is creepy...very much so!!! ""Night Shift"" showed all the aspects of being threatened plus an added bonus: romance. Of course Nora Roberts put in a little romance for her romance fans along with the suspense for her J.D. Robb fans. I just wish I had a cute cop like Boyd Fletcher in my life!!!!! Although... I have no reason to need protection!"
5,GREAT buy!,"Absolutely GREAT buy! This is a REAL crib, real wood and perfect size for my 3&4yr olds. Very well built, I would purchase this again and again! My girls absolutely love it and so do I :)"
2,arrived brocken,"I cant say to much about the Product because it arrived brocken and I had to send it back ! I decided to get a refund and purchase a different crib . I did like the fact that the crib was wood , and that it came with a storage compartment . I did not like the bedding ! Very flimsy and not what it looks like online . I gave it 2 stars just because Customer Service was great to work with as always and I had a refund within 2 days !"
1,Horrible. Packing up to return right now.,Bought this for my 2 year old for her birthday based on the solid reviews. I must have gotten a bad one. Half of the screws were stripped. Paint was coming off of the railing and the knobs were all beat up. Very disappointed and now on a hunt to find something else for her birthday by tomorrow.
3,Cute by cheaply made,This is a very cute doll crib but when we recieved it to put it together it had been so cheaply done that none of the holes matched up and we were missing a couple screws. As this was a christmas gift we did not have time to call and file. I understand screws being missed but for the hold to be drilled in completely the wrong spots that they didnt line up to assemble is disappointing.
1,disappointed,"I am very disappointed in this bed. First, a piece of wood around the railing was cracked. The bedding is very thin and of poor quality. I had to trim pieces of fabric. The blanket is paper thin, and the pillow is NOT a pillow at all. The mobile is out of tune and very plain. Amazon did not have a replacement, and I needed this for a gift. Fortunately, I knew someone who could help me with the cracked wood. Amazon was no help, and Badger products were a disappointment. Lesson learned."
3,Badger Doll Crib with cabinet,"This was a part of Christmas gift for our granddaughter who is 1. My husband put it together with little trouble. It looked so cute. However, as we were carrying it on Christmas morning to her house, one wheel broke off. There was no pressure put on it and it did not hit anything. We took it anyway hoping we could fix it at her house. It could not be fixed and actually as it was moved again in the house and another wheel broke off. So, my son in law took the other wheels off. My grandaughter loves it. I would recommend that the wheels not be put on the doll bed."
4,Pleased for the price.,Decent crib for the price. The mobile is too large and cheaply made and the bumper and blanket aren't great quality. The overall construction of the crib is decent and functional with the storage underneath. My 3 year old loved it!
4,great wooden doll bed for the price,"We needed a bigger doll bed for my daughter since she wanted a bigger baby doll for Christmas. I got a good deal and free shipping and it was delivered within two days. It took me about 30 min to put it together, super easy. It seems to be sturdy enough (my 2 year old had to climb into it...) and my daughter loves it.Two things I did not like: The blanket is just a tiny flimsy piece of fabric and the mobile broke while putting it together, but I knew the mobile would just be in the way so I did not mind at all.Overall, I can recommend the dollbed ."
4,Badger Doll Crib,"This doll crib was very nice after I finally got it together. However, I had to break off some dowel pins and drill some extra holes in one of the support bars since it had been constructed incorrectly.The overall assembly was not too difficult until I ran into this bar that was wrong. Fortunately I had the tools to fix it to get it to work."
5,My granddaughter loves it!,This is a really sturdy little doll crib! I was expecting something quite so nice! It only took about 30 minutes to put together and my granddaughter absolutely loves it!
1,disappointed,I purchased this bed along with the Melissa and Doug high chair. The high chair was a piece of cake to assemble with the holes placed in the correct location. The doors on this bed had holes placed in the opposite direction of what they should have been. Directions were also written very poorly. The finish on the wood was also not very good and uneven. It is not a $50.00 toy. I would never recommend this item to any friend.
4,Good product,This was a beautiful crip for my daughter. I really like it and so does she. Unfortunately the kids tried to climb into it and there is a small crack in the wood but almost unnoticable. I would say that its pretty durable seeing as how it didnt collapse when they got into it. I would definitly recommend this bed to other people. Our family loved it too. So real like!
3,"It's a gift, so the box hasn't even been opened yet","This is to be a Christmas Gift for my 2 1/2 yearold Granddaughter so I haven't even opened the box yet. But I didn't want to keep getting Reminders to review the purchase, so I went ahead and filled this out."
4,Adorable,"As other reviews stated, it was easy to put together. It was short one bolt, but quickly sent and easy too order. The bedding included can only be described as ""cute"", but something you want to replace. It was flimsy. However, the crib itself is just darling and I couldn't be happier."
2,Broken,"When I got the basket, it was scratched and distressed. Also, the mobile was crushed and unusable. I have contacted for a replacement and herd nothing back!"
3,Crib,"Not as easy as I thought to put together really needs two people, one to hold and one to screw the pieces together. My Grand daughter loved it and pushed it around the house until the wheels fell off. 2 days so we took them off but now she still plays with it but it is not able to be pushed from one place to another.I think that is a good thing. My mobile was damaged when we received the crib and they are suppose to be sending a new one ... I think this will add to the enjoyment of the crib. Great storage space for doll clothes."
2,made very cheap,"It's cute, however I was disappointed by the quality. I got it for my daughter for x-mas and it's already falling apart. The screws don't screw tight, they just spin in the holes. My husband is going to have to glue everything and figure out how to make it more sturdy. If you do buy the product, when you put it together, use wood glue from the beginning this way it won't fall apart."
5,Exceeded our expectations,"This product exceeded our expectations. It was easy to assemble and made of quality durable wood materials. The crib itself is exceptional. The bedding is nice except the blanket is pretty skimpy. We used the storage area for diapers, blankets and cloths. Our 2 year old loves it. It is perfect size for her to use. We looked everywhere for a crib and this one is by far the best we found and very reasonably priced."
1,Disappointed,My child got this crib as a gift from her friend for xmas. It is now February 5th and this item is already broken. The wood came apart of the sides of the posts. We are very disappointed in the quality of the product that we received.
2,Fell apart on Christmas Day,II bought this for my daughter for Christmas and it fell apart a couple hours after she started playing with it. Not very good construction. It is not worth the price. This is JUNK. Please don't waste your time or money.
2,Badger Basket White Doll Crib,I purchased two of the Badger Basket Doll crib's for my granddaughters. I think it is beautiful and an item every little girl would like with the pink inserts and the mobile BUT as far as this item staying together it is MADE POORLY! After putting it together I realized it would not stay that way with any child using it. I took the entire cribs apart and using toothpicks and wood glue began to assemble it back together. I can only hope it will stay together and I will not have to do the process again. If you are not handy and have ALOT of patience I DO NOT recommend purchasing this item.
3,Doll Crib for Christmas,It had some broken pieces. This was troublesome as it was a Christmas gift and opened on the day. There were also a coupleof unusual sized screws missing. I understand the company is sending replacement pieces. My grand daughter loved the crib and is very excited with the bedding and mobile.
5,Absolutely Fabulous!!!,"This was so easy to put together, all the parts were there. It looks great and is very durable. I wasn't actually aware that the mobile turns and plays music when you wind it, It requires no batteries, just wind it. The cabinets are nice. My 4 year old keeps her diapers and wipes under there. Its a great, great buy. I love it!! So does my child."
1,Broke a week later,It was great for the first week.. It was missing a start for the mobile from the start but other than that my daughter loved pushing it throughout the house. A week later the wheels cracked and the doors do not stay shut.... Not really durable
1,couldn't finish assembly,"I could not finish the piece as the metal parts for the doors to swing on made the doors 1/4 inch too big for the frame. I finished it without the doors and found two of the big screw holes were already stripped and the screws stuck out 1/4 inch and just spun around. I have no idea how to return stuff...and so will just glue it together until it falls apart...I have 18 grandchildren 8 and under, mostly girls. This will probably not last one day as they play""house"" all the time."
4,Precious doll crib,"Very cute doll crib. Perfect size for toddlers. Very short for school age kids. Received with multiple broken pieces, possibly from shipping so kids were disappointed that it couldn't be used right away. Called the company and the parts were shipped and to us in a couple of days. Direction for putting together are pictures. Can be a bit confusing with which way certain pieces are to be facing. Much easier to put together with two people. Backing looks cheap, so not as cute from behind if turning and moving with the wheels. Blanket and pillow are not useful. Very thin. That said, once put together, is very sturdy. Looks adorable and kids love it. Fits a larger doll or two small dolls. Would purchase again."
1,poor design,Was advertised as coming with baby alive doll but didn't. X-mas eve was assembling when I realized holes for screws were drilled to wide and barley held it together and the cheap press board just couldn't it and broke before I could get both sides on. Would have been such a cute gift to give and since was x-mas eve could not replace it. Will be returning product and finding something else. It is a shame the time wasn't taken to design this better.
2,Inadequate Attempts,"Rosalyn Terborg-Penn has taken on an arduous task. Sufficiently uncovering the nuances of African American women's roles in the struggle for suffrage would be possible only for a highly-trained historian. Unfortunately, Terborg-Penn writes not as an objective historian, but as a woman with strong, personal opinions on her subject. As her opinions take over, the facts recede and the book becomes a vehicle for her subjectivity. She forces her evidence to conform to a seemingly pre-formed, inflexible thesis and conclusion, leaving the reader with knowledge of little more than Terborg-Penn's opinions."
4,"Great pictures, Marino speaks",Some excellent pictures of both the Dolphins and Marino. Marino speaks of both the good and the mediocre of his career from his upbringing and his family through his wife and kids. He doesn't touch on any huge surprises or vent any frustrations. A good book for the huge Marino fan. I went through it in about 1/2 an hour sitting in the store. Nice for the coffee table
4,I love all Charlie's books.,This novel certainly disappoint. It was a wonderful journey and shows that family ties really runs deep. I thoroughly enjoyed it.
4,My Ride With Gus Review,I found the book to be extremely enjoyable; the author has a good sense of humor and timing with unexpected twists in the plot and heroic traits in his characters.
4,Fun riding with Gus,This story is a fun read of a very imaginative adventure. Every page has unexpected turns with with each becoming more bizarre.
4,Strong character development,"This is the third Carillo book I've read and it is difficult to say which I liked best. As with the others, women are secondary to the book, so it was a nice change of pace from the usual ""chick lit"". As the story unfolds, you learn little by little about Gus' life until you feel that you have always known him and could always count on him. A good guy in a not so good profession. Definitely worth reading."
4,Pleasant Ride,"A Mafia member, an architect and a priest. Didn't think this would interest me so much, but I have to admit I did enjoy this book. The ride is amusing with so many twists and turns. Particularly loved the ending which puts all the pieces together. There were a ton of hyphenated words in the middle of a sentence which became annoying, but for a $.99 read, well worth the price."
4,My Ride With Gus,I am a great fan of this author. His books always cheer me up and give me laughs while also having such a lot of heart in his stories. What a pity he doesn't write more often as I have now read them all and waiting eagerly for the next one.
2,Great until it broke,"I loved this gadget. It made beautiful garlic slices quickly. the problem is that it broke after about ten uses. The interior plastic ""plunger"" busted. I will not replace this item because I feel it will just happen again."
5,To Much,"A typical trail drive story. Lots of problems but what would you expect when you're driving thru a thousand miles of Indians, harsh land wet and dry, raining hard and hotter than the worst desserts. You may have survived the civil war but this is a different story. Another very intertaining trail drive except Mr. Compton had just to many rain storm disasters."
2,40 days and 40 nights!,"this is not one of Comptons best efforts! It must have rained for 40 days and 40 nights. reminds me of the character in Lil' Abner that had a rain cloud following him around. Not much action and too much boring details about trail herding. The main character starts out with $40,000 dollars. If you read this book, keep a running total of the amount he spends.... even in 1866 prices. the acurracy of these coyboys using new unfamielier rifles at 1000 yds is unbelievable. Sorry Compton only two stars...don't worry I will buy other books by you. most hat I have read are very good."
4,Photographer with GBGH Photography,"Panorama Maker 3 was inexpensive and fairly efficient at creating satisfactory panoramas. I have Photoshop to create Panoramas, but Panorama Maker 3 allows more control over the photographs. Panorama three doesn't create a quality Panorama to Photoshop, but close in comparison. Sometimes Panorama 3 makes errors in it's final results and you would need to do it over again to search for a better result. There later versions of Panorama Maker are out, but for $19.99, Panorama Maker 3 is a steal if your on a budget or starting out in creative Photography. Personaly as a Photographer I'm on a tight budget and if I don't need to get the latest version to do a satisfactory job, then why do so. Panorama Maker 3 is simple enough to figure out, while Panorama Maker 5 and Photoshop are difficult to use if you don't know the software. For web work, sharing and some printing Panorama Maker 3 is fine and will produce good results for viewing.Arcsoft Panorama Maker 3"
4,Excellent choice for your collection!,"Ms. Hedley has an amazing voice. She sings each song with passion. If you are a woman experiencing the up and downs of a relationship this album has a song for you. The first time I listened to the album I played ""I Wish I Wasn't Your Girl"" six times in a row and cried through three of them. I then removed the repeat program and continued through the end of the CD. I really liked the message in ""Sista Girl."" ""He Is"" is one of the best songs on the CD. This is a good one for your collection instead of pulling out your Sade Cd's when heartbroken, put Heather on, cry and then smile when the songs pick up in tempo and sentiment."
4,Good first cd,"I purchased this cd, because I love ""He Is"" . Now the cd stays in the cd changer. She has some very good powerful songs. I love ""I wish I wasn't"" and ""Sista Girl"". This cd takes you back to the way love should be and how you should feel toward someone. You don't have to worry about hearing women being called B's or H's on this cd. Just pure soul."
4,Great Cd!,I watched this young lady perform in AIDA in NYC and she was wonderful. The audience gave her a standing ovation. Great cd - my favorite Sista Girl. The outstanding voice from AIDA has been passed on to this album.
4,Outstanding,"This entire CD is HOT! She has a powerful voice. The lyrics and music is a good combination and you can relate to every track on this CD. She keeps it real and soulful. A good addition to my music collection. If you like Indie Irie, Jill Scott and Erica Badu, etc. You will like this CD. Enjoy."
3,Great Voice but whiny and repetitive lyrics,"HH has a great voice. The love songs on the album unfortunately sound the same. She is complaining about some man that keeps disappointing her in about 60% of the album. The music is good. Her voice is great but the love songs are trite, boring and unnecessarily repetitive. Hopefully her next album will catch her on the up."
3,Worth the Buy,"I purchased this one just from listening to a few snippets on this site, and it's a decent CD. Her voice reminds me of ""Angela Bofill"", especially on the cut, ""I wish I wasn't"".The songs were ok, nothing that really blew me away, but very decent. Looking forward to more growth from this artist."
3,"When I first heard her debut song, I was impressed, but....",I thought the other songs were a little boring. I kept skipping tracks. I think Heather Headley has a wonderful voice and she is a great singer. Maybe the next one will be more appealing to me.
5,Undiscovered talent,"Heard ""I Wish I Wasn't"" on XM radio & had to check this artist out. Very soulful. Terrific voice. Thank God for XM 'cuz I never heard her before.Enjoy--I did."
3,A strong first effort,"Songs like ""Sunday"" and ""Nature of a Man"" were great surprises and gems within this first sampling of Ms. Headley's work. Sadly I cannot say all the songs touched me but that is with any artist's work, some songs are faves and others quick fast forwards to the next song. I enjoyed this debut and would have it on rotation any place I go."
1,heather headley,"I think that heather has a beautiful and strong voice,however from what I've heard,I only really like one of the selections."
2,Great voice not so good CD,"I have been a fan of Heather's voice from The Lion King and Aida .I do not think this CD showcase's her voice like the broadway shows she was in.There are very few songs on this Cd That I like, but then again I am not a big fan of R@B music."
2,What a waste of money,"I really didnt like this CD. There is only one good song was ""I Wish, I wasnt"". Other than that this CD is not all dats. When i first purchased this CD i thought it was gonna be off the chain but after i listened to it i wanted to take this CD back to the store. IF I WAS U I WOULD BUY THIS CD."
3,...a good beginning...,"...miss headley's voice is rich and full, no doubt... has hints of anita baker/toni braxton... the production is vintage-imitation-neo-soul (if that makes any sense!) and almost has that late 80's r&b feel to it despite the d'angelo-ish 'vibe' it reaches for... think mary j. blige's ""not gon' cry"" - much of the album has a similiar sound as that song...""he is"" is the jewel on this disc and it's what compelled me to buy this cd... a couple of other cuts stand up, but fail to stand out, mostly due to production than vocals... they follow the pre-set neo-soul formula for the most part tho. if you liked jaguar wright then you will proly enjoy some of this also!"
4,Great Voice with Style,"My husband and I saw Aida in New York in September 2001 (yes, we were there) for Heather's last show - I sat next to her mother. I bought the soundtrack for Aida at the intermission, and I bought this CD as soon as I saw that it was for sale. I love Heather's voice - so deep and soulful. I listen to the Aida soundtrack all the time, and have been able to do the same with this. A great singer with lots of potential."
4,I like it!,"Heather's voice is very theatrical but i love these songs. The Cd is not GREAT but it is a complete CD. I find it pleansant and enjoyable. I will buy her next piece of work. The best song is ""I wish I wasn't in love with you"". I think her music is refreshingly different."
3,I can't really get into this album,"I anticipated the release of this album and when it came out, I got it and found myself scanning through the tracks that didn't catch my ears. No matter how much I try, this album won't allow me to sit down long enough without getting restless. I gave it a neutral ratng because while she does have a great voice, her tracks to me didn't do her any real justice besides the single hit. Better luck next time."
5,Wonderful,"This young lady possesses the ability really sing a varity of music. I heard ""He Is"" on the radio and was captivated by the music and words of the songs...Very talented."
4,Very Good!,"I was pleasantly surprised by Heather Headley's debut album, ""This Is Who I Am."" I bought the album when I heard that she had starred on Broadway in the incredible play, Aida. I wanted to see if someone from the stage could pull off doing an R&B album. Well, Heather is truly a talent because she pulled it off beautifully.I would highly recommend this album to anyone who wants to hear beautiful and soulful music."
5,"If you don't know, she is for real!","This entire CD is slammin'. I was hooked from the very first time that I listened to it. It is a very mature album -- by that I mean if you usually like the top 40 sound, she is not for you. She is a cross between Indie Arie, Tamia, Deborah Cox with a splash of Jill Scott. If you like any of those artists, this is a no-brainer -- go out and pick this one up today. I promise that you won't be disappointed."
5,Heather Rocks!!,"Discovered this artist a few years back through one of those recommendation links and I have been hooked on her music ever since. Thought this album was the best thing to hit the airwaves in forever. . until I discovered her second album! She is amazing! Both of her albums are incredible, soulful, beautiful and rank right up there with the likes of Mary J. Blige and Christina Aguilera. This CD is great, but her second CD RULES!! Get them both, you won't be disappointed!"
4,Solid R&B Album,"Nice voice. ""Uplifting"" is the word to summarize this album. It does not rise above or break new ground, but it was a good purchase. The girl definitely can sing."
5,Amazing,"This truly is an amazing cd. Especially I wish I wasn't and Four words from a heartbreak. If you like this genre of music at all, I suggest you get this cd. Download it, buy it, steal it...just get it."
5,Found my wedding song on this album,Great product. I bought this album because I love Heather Headley and one of her songs I will be using for my first dance.
4,this is who i am hh,"Heather Headley can sing and is an amazing artist. However, I found only three or four songs in the CD that I really love and the rest are just ok to me."
2,Hmmmm...,"I bought the album expecting more classic tunes like ""I Wish..."", the reality was very different. A very mixed bag for the most part, she has a lovely voice but there were too may producers and too many experiments going on throughout the album. Really liked the D'Influence tracks, I'm a big fan of their music from back in the day. I still don't know what the direction is for Heather, but I would like to. Maybe next time it will become clear."
2,I Am So Disappointed.....,"I really don't know what to say. Heather Headley is so overrated. I still can't force myself to listen to this cd twice. With all the hype, and the radio promotion, you would think that it would be satisfactory. If there hadn't been so much hype, it might have been tolerable. If you want something worthy of your money, pick up Vivian Green's ""A Love Story""."
3,Heather Headly - 1st album,"Loved a ""few"" songs. Otherwise I wasn't overly impressed. Seemed a little done, not original enough for me personally anyway. What I found was that the songs generally were too ""in between"" for me. Meaning they didn't want to make me dance enough, yet they didn't inspire me to cry."
5,"France: Paris, Normandy & Brittany","A very relaxed, informative tour of three distinct areas which should be on everyone's ""Bucket List"". Brittany and Normandy have had their own unique histories apart from France."
4,CR2 battery,These are expensive batteries when purchased at camera stores or Radio Shack. Good price and good service from the vendor.
4,Price Issue,This style battery is expensive. I have a 1.5 million volt stun gun that the wife carries and these batteries work very well in it.
1,Do NOT fall for the Duracell Packaging!,I ordered two sets of this product for $17 total thinking that the picture was representative of the product and I got a great deal. This seller shipped the four batteries in an envelope and when I measured the voltage it was 2.8V to 2.9V which indicates that these batteries may be used. I am extremely disappointed and sad that an Amazon seller will resort to cheating!
2,Product packaging misrepresented,"Duracell Ultra Batteries with shelf life of 2021 delivered wrapped in small zip lock bag, and not in retail packaging as in product picture. Voltage checked and showed 3.2V for each indicating that they appear to be fresh. Description should not imply that it is in retail package. I have no way of knowing if they are counterfeit. They certainly look legit. Don't know if I will purchase from this vendor again. Will see how long they last."
2,Product does not come in a Duracell blister pack!,"Although the item picture clearly shows batteries in a retail blister pack, the batteries I received actually came loose in an envelope. These did not look like brand-new batteries. Buyer beware!"
4,Interesting perspectives on the Raj,"This is an account of the Indian Civil Service under the Raj. It provides a mixture of structural analysis and anecdotal accounts of specific individuals. The author makes a good case that the Civilians in the service were hard working and genuinely interested in providing a good and just administration. They were notably incorruptible. They served as a tiny, isolated elite in a vast sub-continent.The seeds of their fall were always present. They wanted to help India and to raise an educated forward-looking Indian middle class. But how could that class, raised to respect justice and democracy, not ultimately reject its mentors?The book is occasionally slow, but generally moves along well and carries it weight."
5,Moved a lot for work? Read this book...,"A wonderful peek into the long-ago lives of British civil servants who kept the empire going in far-away India.If you're a member of a military family or a corporate trailing spouse with more than a few miles on the odometer, expect to resonate with sympathy. The Empire is long gone, but the problems of work and relocation are timeless."
5,The best there is!,"This book is so well written, covering so many primitive skills, that a student could spend years just working off this book alone. In my opinion, this is the best out there."
2,I didn't like this book at all,"I found this book to be poorly written, inadequately edited, and virtually impossible to use alone. Chapter three details making a bow and arrow using modern tools and deer sinew. There's no explanation of how to get deer sinew if you don't have the tools to hunt deer. I'm sure there's information in here. . .the chapter on making fire looked like it may be useful if you're willing to drag through the amateur writing. Overall, however, I found the book to be a waste of time and money."
1,Dont waste your time,I didnt learn anything from this book. Everything is so complicated. It is not for people how dont have any idea about survival living.
4,Good book for info. in its area,"For primitive skills this is a realy good book to start with. I would have given it 3 1/2 stars if i could have. I injoyed reading this book and it has good primitive skill infomation. Informitive and not hard to read and understand. Primitive skills are a quality skills to have in a survival situation and help us appreciate the modern convinences we have. Plus we need to keep theses skills alive just incase and to have a living history of where we come from, technology area.Even if you are not interested in learning these skills it is a good book to understand how people use to live daily in this country."
4,primitive wilderness living,"Information that you will never be able to find anywhere else. If primitive living is your thing, this book is a must read."
4,Just as advertised,"This book is just as advertised -- a great how too, with many pictures. I'm still looking for that perfect wilderness living book, where the authors don't expect their reader to live quite so radically, but this is a great addition to the bookshelf of the dedicated survivalist.Now, someone write a great survival book that takes into account the fact that we can GLEAN all sorts of tools, utensils, etc., from stuff already existing, and that we DON'T have to reinvent the wheel to live off the land!"
4,Together with David Wescott`s books you don`t need more!,"For those really interrested buy the ""Primitive Technology, books "" by David Wescott (these are bigger and have real good drawings)and the two "" Naked into the Wilderness"" books by the McPhersons (smaller and quit bad quality black and white pictures). In addition you only need to stop reading after a while, go out, and do your thing!"
5,Great Book,"This book is a great book for learning primitive skills, I also recommend the second book."
3,Wilderness wanta'be,"This is a very interesing book, make sure you are buy ing the 4th edition. It's the ""primitive"" living guide. Photo's are few and only black and white. But I'm glad I bought it."
5,"For living, not surviving","This book is a must for anyone who wants to enjoy the wild without a huge amount of gear.I am a country boy who grew up doing Boy Scout stuff, then spent 10 years in the Army. I like to go into the woods with nothing but a small bag holding a water filter, a knife, a small saw, and a net. I still learned things from this book. The real value of it is it is not a ""survival"" book that teaches you how to last for three to ten days while trying to make your way back to civilization. It is about living in the wilderness, the way ""primitive"" people did. You can live this way indefinitely.This book is written from a place of absolute authority. The authors live everything they write about, and use pictures to demonstrate them doing it. Nothing within the two covers will steer you wrong.Great read."
4,Okay,"I used this book to prepare for the PSAT, and I guess that it did its job. A lot of the book was full of stupid stuff, like telling you to cross out all of the answers that you know are wrong so that you have a better chance of getting the right answer, and stuff like that. The only thing that I really used in this book was the practice tests, which definately did help."
4,A Comprehensive Map,"I disdain electronic navigators, I use Google to plan ahead, but when I go off my prepared map I use a few atlases. Such a small atlas can't contain much detail, but if you can pay attention to the small, dark, poorly placed road signs of New England, this atlas will help your find your way."
5,I love Pema,"Her CD talks are so easy to listen to. She takes sometimes complex Buddhist concepts and makes them understandable for us Westerners. I love that she is ""one of us"" and therefore can relate to the North American lifestyle and therefore makes her concepts accessible to us. I would highly recommend any of her CDs.However, I should note that after you listen to a few different ones, they do start to sound the same. I like that however, because the more I hear the same things, the deeper is soaks into my soul, and brain!"
4,True Happiness Pema Chodron,"Good life lessons from a Buddist Nun. Soothing and Helpful, people for all walks of life can certainly benefit from listening to this retreat. I have not ever been disappointed by listening to Pema Chodron."
5,Wonderful,"Once again, the calming voice of Pema Chodron provides wisdom and sanity on this recording of an exceptional presentation she gave during a retreat at Gampo Abbey. Chock full of insights, lessons, and inspiration, this CD is sure to please Pema fans as well as those new to her teachings."
3,not so good,"it's not the beast I've heard of Pema, if you have some of her books or Cds I'd skip this one."
1,it's not all region,"I'm a big F1 fan and was really excited about this BD. Finally I got it, but it's coded for European region, so I can't watch it. Should've listen to the person who wrote his review instead of Amazon."
1,Error on delivered DVD's,"Err message in DVD for 2011 revieww for both disk!!Last yera firs DVD OK, but the secon the same history Err!!!!"
5,Great reference material,"Some books give you workbook like examples to do. Some times that approach works best, but for me, I just want to read about how the software works, and apply it to the work I am doing. This is not a step-by-step book where you do exercises, which for my needs is good. This book includes a CD of the whole book, plus other things. Overall, I have found this book able to address my techncial questions in depth, the CD is worth the price alone."
3,More than enough,"It appears to be more than I wanted, so not sure if it will work for me. Just wanted a straightforward 'how to for using email', but I'm sure the info. is in there somewhere. Book fit your description however, I think."
3,washed up g,"now in 95 i lived on the blocK wit dis g got a lil $ and turned dope fiend, but used 2 b a killa.A.M.G.B. GANG 4 LIFE MUSIC SUKS"
2,Poor Pierce,Another poor Pierce Brosnan effort. I just found this annoying and got bored about half-way through. Figured out the real murderer pretty quickly and the over-acting on Pierce's part really got to me. Not my cup of tea.
3,"Adequate, not great.",I would have to agree with the review of the person who said it was 'weak' but got the job done. It's what our family terms a 'mindless' movie .. something that is fun to watch without having to invest a lot of thought.
3,Fun but Weak,"This was a moderately entertaining film, but with a limited cast of suspects, the resolution wasn't too much of a shock. The premise is pretty interesting: how does an expert crime writer (and college professor) deal with being involved in the Hitchcockian nightmare of being falsely accused of murder and investigating on his own to protect himself? Add in the complication of a previous ""unrelated"" murder and the fun starts. Brosnan is pretty good as the hapless professor. Never a great actor, he certainly added life to the role and kept the momentum going."
4,Murder 101,"Thank you for having this DVD for sale, looks good in my Pierce Brosnan collection... however I am still yet to watch it!"
4,Very Bright Strobe!!,"I open it up and plugged it in. Works great!! VERY BRIGHT!I wish it was 220 and 110, but still a really well built light."
5,Something New,Stunning and amazingly beautiful music. Pretty astounding that humans have been writing for keyboard for 300+ years and are still have not exhausted the possibilities of the instrument.
1,Caught on FIRE last night!!,"Ok, so the tv is 11 years old and I did not buy it on Amazon.. Just need to say..It really was on fire last night and thank the Lord we were at home and we still have one. Very scary."
2,"quality , price and condition of this book",I was disappointed in the condition of the book. The description said new but that was not the case. I was charged $18.03 and a label on the back said $10.95. The book also had a musty smell to it and I HAVE DECIDED NOT TO ORDER ANY MORE BOOKS FROM THE MARKRT PLACE.
5,Essential,"This book should be in the library of anyone who studies mathematics. It should be kept near by and used like believers use the bible: they already know the scriptures but they pick it up from time to time for the pure joy of reading. From single variable to multivariable, you may not learn anything new but, for example, you might want to brush up on your hyperbolic functions. It is just a great read, simple, helpful drawings: you feel like you are holding a quality manuscript. (Above, it says import, but my copy was printed in the USA.)"
3,EXCEEDED EXPECTATIONS!,"After 50 years of freqent use, I wanted to replace my old, 1st edition, college book. On AMAZON Books, I found a 2nd edition book by the same author and publisher. The book was advertised as "" used, very good condion""/ I was delited to receive the book in NEW, UNUSED CONDITION. Even the dust jacket looked new. Of course, I am extremely satisfied!!!!"
5,A powerful book.,"If you are interested in high impact material this is the book for you. Today, in our Internet/computer connected world, we frequently find ourselves running at break-neck speed. I also recommend you get ""Life and Death on the Internet"" by Keith A. Schroeder. It will be easier to live in the world we do with the information provided."
3,Damaged item,The CD came with one side damaged and the place in the back of the book where the CD was held was damaged. The CD won't work since the side is damaged. The book is great but it would be nice to have a CD that works.
3,"robert snyder, a look and a wish","cudos to any documentary film maker that challenges the very nature of that hum-drum world... Bob tried his best,but his own personality interfered.. But without him, there neve would have been anything on HM... He was a valued friend, confidant and a great person... So it's worth watching... Someone should get the miles of unused film out of the vaults and go forward....."
3,A good watch for Miller lovers.,"It's wonderful to watch and hear Miller on screen--he comes across as the coot you hoped him to be, and you get to know him more personally. The big problem with the film is that director, Robert Snyder, indulges Miller--the older Miller, insomniac, chasing Japanese girls; the Big Sur, guru-type, full-of-himself Miller--far too much. Unfortunately, Snyder seems to be the type of Miller devotee who takes the man at face value--that is, Snyder believes entirely in the image Miller was fond of projecting. There's no depth whatsoever to the film, no compelling questions are answered about Miller's real life and work, and the Miller initiate will find the documentary disappointing, as he will learn nothing about Miller beyond what the author has already said in his works. Though it's fun to watch as a document of Miller's voice and personality, it's rather too sycophantic and too shallow as a documentary."
2,used to be much better....,"I was a worldmate customer when they first came out on palm years ago and i loved it... they always seemed to be able to come out with better and better products until recently!Now they are not even able to give me correct information - the clocks are wrong, the weather unreliable and the flight information is incomplete...I am still giving it a 2 star because they used to be good..."
3,Movie they never show on TV,Great little movie. Cindy Williams is a scream as a would-be religious fanatic who falls far short of her goals. Fred Ward and Harry Dean Stanton are also very funny.
2,If this is the same video that I got from my gf in india (says FREE with Kellogg's special K 435g pack) then its a no no,"I could be wrong, this might be an extended version of the video, but the video I got consists of 4 parts (the end is a commercial of some guy trying to sell you something).. The video itself is good for a total beginner, but it's about 15 minutes total time of actual yoga. The rest of the 4 parts of the video is simple talking by the very pretty Indian actress about some issues she's had (she is quite sexy).. But I am very disappointed about the video in general.. Please do email me if I do have the wrong video, mine's is not good (The 15 minutes of ACTUAL yoga and miss Lara speaking going too fast ""take a few moments to breath"" without actually pausing and moving on to the next more)."
1,Screaming racist things in a loud way is not funny Carlos.,"Seriously. He's not funny. He just yells out racial slurs and racist comments ... which in itself is not bad IF it is told in a form of a joke. But he doesn't tell jokes, he just says racist crap in a tone that almost tries to convince you that it's suppose to be funny.Stupid people will laugh at his stuff. And if he does have good material every now and then, most likely he stole it from other comics.Just search for Bill Cosby and Carlos Mencia on youtube, you can see an example of blatant and shameless plagarism."
5,Great DVD,"This DVD is hilarious, funny, and extremely graphic in nature to entertain adults. Highly recommended..."
1,Lame!,"This is the most annoying DVD, ever. There's not a single idea in it that any mother doesn't instinctively already know."
1,extremely annoying,"I had high hopes for the DVD, as we love the AHA classes, but the DVD is really rather strange. The ""parent"" is wearing false eyelashes! It might be of use to someone who has no ideas about what to do with a baby, but it is very strained and contrived. Worst of all, my daughter was furious that the scene pictured on the box did not appear in the video."
4,gently blended melodies,"if you're talking about quality indie pop, you're talking about orwell. they don't only produce songs; they produce music. try it for yourself."
5,Works perfectly fine.,"I ordered this charger as a replacement for another generic charger. The plug that plugs into the phone on the other charger eventually fell apart, and I fixed it and it still fell apart later on. I'm not a teenage girl, I don't abuse these things.This charger has a very nice plug. It feels solid and click into the phone nicely. I never have to wiggle it at all to get the phone to start charging.Also, the ""wall wart"" has the plugs oriented in such a way that the body is ""sideways"" and doesn't cover up both spaces on a standard American wall receptacle. Nice touch."
4,Memories,We have spent many long car trips with our 3 young children singing along with Linda Arnold's songs in the early nineties.The tape got lost during our numerous moves and so I tought of replacing it by the CD this Christmas for memory sake. We had a wonderfull time listening to the lovely songs again with our now adult children!
5,My favorite as a kid!,I totally used to belt this stuff out with my little kid electric microphone when I was little. These songs are so fun for little kids!
5,very good,"I have a tape of Peppermint Wings, I was afrade it coud brakes, so I ordered a cd, very nice songs for kids, I love it"
4,Amazing,"I had this album on LP (remember them?) and was delighted to find it available for download. Mina's three-octave range is put to good use here, especially in ""Moonlight Serenade."" Through brilliant overdubbing, there are at least 10 Minas on that track. The vocal arrangements are wonderful. Some tracks are only so-so, but on the whole, the album is marvelous. Mina is a great singer, not that well known in the US because of her alleged fear of flying over water. Her appearances have pretty much been limited to Europe. Their gain, our loss. And this album is just one out of dozens she has recorded over the years. A welcome addition to my library."
2,disappointed,this is a good product but was disappointed that only one dumbell arrived when I thought that they were sold in pairs
3,Don Leifert...A Fiend???,"Don Leifert, aka Mr. Longfellow, was my English and Theater teacher in high school. I picked up Fiend on DVD as a tribute to him, after his passing in October. He wore his B-movie roots and heritage on his sleeve, and spoke fondly of his collaborations with Don Dohler.He was a discerning critic, despite his work with Dohler - and often engaged his students, friends, and family in robust discussions about their favorite films.I awarded Fiend 3 stars out of respect for a great friend and teacher, and to remind people that humanity and passion exist behind any project.In the end, Eric Longfellow is nowhere near as interesting as the man who portrayed him."
5,"If you're going to do it, Do it right!","The built in flash on the Camera itself is really only effective to about twelve feet. If you are zooming in at a distance and lighting is an issue, look no further. This Slave flash is fully adjustable to fire when and how you need and light itself swivels to control that pesky red eye and light to distance ratio. It's really just a question of weather you want to take great, quality pics or fade into mediocrity and messed up once in a lifetime shots? I don't know about you, but when I dump serious coin on an item like a precision camera, I want all the bells and whistles to make it perform to it's potential."
3,Como Hacer Artesanía con Velas,"Quisiera conocer las técnicas para hacer velas decorativas, asimismo, utilizar la aromaterapia en las mismas."
4,One great character walks and rides LA busses again,"_Walkin' the Dog_ is closer to being a novel than the previous stories featuring the menacingly large reformed ex-con Socrates Fotlow, _Always Outnumbered, Always Outgunned_. Repetitions of basic information about the characters is rarer. If the stories were published separately, there is no indication of credits.Socrates remains a compelling figure. He continues to develop, as he manages rage that is often provoked. Unfortunately, his quasi-son Daryl doesn't grow (as a character).The final chapter/story in the book is particularly gripping, though I remain uncertain that someone conditioned to self-preservation in a long prison sentence would undertake such dangerous public protest. Several non-black, mostly Latino people champion him in his confrontations with police, developers, and coworkers. Mosley's prose is always compelling and any sentimentality rubs against a world of Brechtian pressures and troubles."
5,New Moseley fan,"I've never read any other Walter Moseley titles before, so I can't compare this to his other works. But I loved this book. The characters were well drawn and represented an entertaining and realistic cross section of L.A. types. I thought the device of putting the characters in a discussion group was wonderful... a setup to let Mosely voice his own internal arguments, but done in a way that still seemed natural. I liked hearing the complex, paradoxical, conflicting and human mix of views that these characters hashed out in their meetings."
3,"strong characters, no plot","There are lots of things to admire about this book. The characterizations and settings are dead-on believable and often quite fascinating. However, not much happens in the book (much like life, I guess), no beginning-middle-end. Worst of all, the final chapter feels tacked-on, a false attempt to bring the story to a big conclusion that doesn't ring true."
3,Not Up To Snuff,"Though I'm a big Walter Mosely fan, I was not overly impressed with his latest effort. The story was bleak until the end when Socretes stands up for himself in a non-violent manner. Until then, the characters were always angry. Some characters drifted in and out with little to say or do. I like Mosely's terse style, but I think the story could have benefited from a more desciptions. I'm waiting for the return of Easy Rawlings."
1,Worst Book I Have Ever Read,"Here, at last, is the worst book I have ever read and am likely to read. Harriet Rubin has collected a few childish anecdotes and added some misreadings of Machiavelli to produce her "" Princessa"". It is clear that she has never read ""The Prince"". It is also clear that she knows little about the women she mentions, including Benazir Bhuto, who is presented as "" former President of Pakistan"", and Anna Akhmatova. It was a painful read. Fortunately, I skipped a lot. It would have been wiser to skip the whole lot! A Reader from Lndon, Great Britain."
1,The first time I regretted the purchase of a book.,"I still can't believe that it was published. I've read betterwriting efforts by first quarter composition students at a university.She is vague. Her tone is conspiratorial. But why? Try to find an outline of her idea. Perhaps that's the only way to read the entire book. I suggest that one reads Machiavelli. I didn't find his gender to be a hinderance. The fact that I am a ""she"" and Machiavelli was a ""he"" posed no problem."
1,Historical figures?,"Seeing how Harriet Rubin misrepresents history, I don't really see what difference it makes that she didn't have many female figures to draw from. She'd have distorted the facts on them just as she did with Sun Tzu, Walt Whitman, her own self, and Jerry Jones (though she's pretty cagey--probably for legal reasons more than anything--about the last two.)"
4,how a women can focus her energy to be more succesfull,This book really thought me about do's and don'ts in proffessional life of a woman
2,Waste of my time,"Too many words, not enough examples.As a young female engineer, I was hoping to hear detailed suggestions on how to stay feminine, yet command attention and respect from older male coworkers. Instead, she seemed to ramble and repeat herself a lot."
5,You either love it or you hate it....,"I loved it. Harriet Rubin is a visionary for those of us that still believe (or wish to believe) that the path of the heart (combined with the good sense of a skillful mind) has the potential to be the most winning combination in business, as in life. Not for the faint-hearted or those who cannot think outside the box."
1,Disappointing,"Don't waste your time on this book. Convoluted and concepts poorly strung together. Lacking substance, condescending tone, and not realistic. I recommend: Gail Evans' Play Like a Man Win Like a Woman."
1,"If there were a lower rating, i.e. zero, I'd have given it","I am a VP in a startup corp, my second, and have been a woman to contend with in 30 years of business life. The book is 99% drivel. Don't waste your money. Every woman i know, that I've thrown it at - - aka Dorothy Parker - - has agreed. Incidentally, I couldn't wait to give it away."
1,Study group? An excercise in futility.,"The study group idea has not grown out naturally from the popularity of this book. Don't be fooled. It is simply the author's last ditch attempt to save face. The book has been a flop so she (Harriet Rubin) has authored the ""suggestions""--which are ironically exceptionally controlling--to the study group in a pathetic attempt to drum up some interest for the audiobook."
1,Nothing to do with Machiavelli,"The worst book I've ever read on Machiavellian management/practices. The title alone must have propelled this book onto the bestseller list, because the content was severely lacking.As stated by other reviewers, the author changed the outcome of historical stories relating to Sun Tzu to prove her own vague points.I hope for her sake she made quite a profit off of this title and saved her money. I doubt she'll luck out again"
1,"An awful book, unreadable and with factual errors","It's a collection of anecdotes of women using various tricks to gain ""power."" The ""lessons"" of the anecdotes are vague, poorly-stated, and often factually incorrect along with the anecdotes themselves. Women seeking practical advice on success and self-realization will feel cheated by this book. Despite the title and sales pitch, there is NO ... that is ZERO ... useful information.The vagueness and uselessness is occasionally livened up by total idiocy. For example, the author admires some of the worst dirtbags in history. The author also has some other bizarre ideas, for example the notion that Jacqueline Kennedy stayed slim by pigging out.The author works in a publishing company. Maybe that's how she managed to get this piece of c..p published.Although the book is a worthless waste of time, I want to be fair and give credit where due: the cover on my copy (the cover differs from the one shown above) is quite attractive."
1,Absolute Drivel,"When I first saw this book in a local bookstore the inner voice told me to run away--far far away from it. I listened. While on vacation I found I could purchase it cheaper than at home. So, ignoring my first instincts, I bought it.I should have left it at the shop. The book contains ""knowledge"" which any person with an iota of common sense already has. It made me angry--not that I wasted perfectly good money on it, but because I felt that the author is preying upon the stereotypical uncertainties of of a few women.The 45 minutes I took to complete the book are 45 minutes I will never get back. Do not waste your money; do not waste your time."
3,"""A brilliant twist on the spaghetti western genre""","Anglo-Irish punks crossed with Clint Eastwood?! From this odd combination comes a truly entertaining parable of lust and greed. A brilliant twist on the spaghetti western genre, this film features Joe Strummer as a bankrobber, the members of the Pogues as an old west outlaw gang, and Elvis Costello as sheriff."
3,"decent, but lacking","Far better than the wwe book ""the rise and fall of ecw"" and has lots of great stories, however, there aren't many in depth stories of ecws past, nor does it explore much into the past of ecws stars. Also the narrative goes all over the place at points. At one point there's just a list of Tommy dreamers feuds with raven. No real background Kr insight, just matches.Ultimately I do recommend the book, especially at its price point. Being a wrestling fan anxprime member its a free and fun read."
3,Definitely worth reading.,"I've read this book twice over now, and just want to say that it's worth checking out if you are a fan of ECW and would like to know more about it from a business end. Lister put together a pretty good, detail-oriented book despite having to use largely ""second hand"" sources (newsletters, shoot interviews, etc.) and added his own insights in an appropriate manner.This book does an especially good job covering the promotion's final years and the aftermath of its fall, though it does lack some details elsewhere.I would highly recommend pairing this with ""Hardcore History"", as both are independently written and have enough of their own strengths to justify reading each. Most importantly, they aren't tainted by WWE garbage and propaganda.This book is not expensive and is worth picking up. It's not the best wrestling book out there, but if you were a fan of ECW, you owe it to yourself to read it."
3,Not a bad read....,"This book is a pretty detailed book about most of the history of the ECW. For a huge fan of the company like me, it was enjoyable. From a business perspective it was interesting to see where most of the financial dealing was not successful. It's an easy read and includes a fee tidbits not covered in other publications I have read. If your a fan of ECW THEN you would like the book."
3,OK Read,"This one is at best, OK. There are so many more options for better pro wrestling books out there that I would pass on this one."
5,Great for the money,"This holster is comfortable and fits inside the pants well. The material is nice and it doesn't stick to your skin like other synthetic materials. It fit my Glock 20SF perfectly, and the adjustable snap works well. I am glad that I chose to try this holster first, and not drop 3 to 4 times the money on something else.I can see a long life out of this holster."
1,Most Cheating on shipping cost,"There was very very light package with one battery that cost more than $5.00 by USPS, not UPS. I can not believe you charged so much to keep changes as profit! I will report to BBB and I do not like that way you charged us too much. I save all postage dues shown on the boxes and package, too that I ordered last month."
1,Muy pequeno,Antes de ordenarlo me e asegurado si era de un tamano ideal para la video camara digital HMXS15 De Samsung y resulta que es tan pequena que apenas entran los accesorios.
1,Really bad.,"Picked up this CD used the other day ... thinking it was another band named Skylab. I figured it was a unreleased single or something but boy was I wrong! This thing is terrible. It's obviously a self-produced, cheaply made recording. Don't get me wrong the music isn't that bad but the lyrics and attitude were just infantile. Whoever writes the words should try reading some books instead of regurgitating others sentiments. I DO NOT recommend this but have little doubt anyone will ever hear of these guys anyway. I mean they are using the name of a band that has been around awhile and no one has said anything. What does that tell you? I do recommend the REAL Skylab for those of you into trance and dance.PEACE"
1,Really sad,"Ok now that the band and their friends gave it all 5 stars I think people outside of that realm should be able to voice their opinion. Look how the few unfortunate stores that do have it are selling it on here for lower and lower amounts. You'll be able to find it for (...) soon enough. They just want that 2 inches of shelf space back!Now to my feelings of the record it is obviously a bad (...) of Radiohead. You can listen to the soundbytes on their website and there is nothing even slightly memorable about any of the tracks. The singer sounds like he's doing his best to imitate Thom Yorke but can't pull it off. Bottom line is it's NOT original, NOT interesting, and NOT worth mentioning at all. This band will be struggling for a LONG LONG time. I hope they have fun playing to empty clubs on Monday nights for the next 10 years."

1,Too many important errors,The errors in this book caused me to lose a lot of time studying for my exam. I can't believe that this is the 4th edition. Did anybody proof read this book?
3,Provide insight but too much typing errors,"Quite good introduction to the subject.However, this is countered by numerous typing errors in important formulae.It's already in its 4th Ed, just wonder what the first's like."
1,The WORST,"I was looking for a sampler of steel band music, which this appeared to be. It turned out that every song seemed to be played as fast as humanly possible. Maybe they were trying to break the sound barrier. Don't buy this, it's terrible."
4,Great classic film,"Even though the first film was excellent, the sequel was pretty good! I enjoy the vehicles in this film a little more better."
2,Average at best,"I wanted to like this film.I saw the first classic movie when it was new back when I was only 7 years old at the movies in 1977 but I hadn't seen it since the early 80s.So recently I was at a yardsale and they had on VHS Smokey I and II.I had never seen part 2 but I figured I would watch them in order.So I put in part I and by the time it was over I figured I would order it on DVD soon.However, part 2 came across as such a corny ""Jump the shark"" rehash of the first one that I considered turning it off half way through.Sally Fields looked great and Jerry Reed still had his natural good ol boy charm.That being said, the characters of Bandit and Smokey were really forced and came off as weak and clearly trying too hard to recapture their original humor.As a Steelers fan, seeing Bradshaw and Joe Greene was the highlight."
3,A LITTLE LACKING IN PLOT AND ENDING OF MOVIE,"NOT NEARLY AS GOOD AS THE FIRST MOVIE~ 'SMOKY AND THE BANDIT'. NOT MUCH OF A PLOT AND THE END WAS INCOMPLETE. A DECENT MOVIE, ESPECIALLY IF YOU ARE A FAN OF PONTIAC FIREBIRD TRANS AMS. THE FIRST MOVIE WAS WAY MORE ENTERTAINING."
2,A shame,"The writers could not put together as interesting a story as the first movie. Seems to me the storyline for this sequel had been established at the end of SMOKEY AND THE BANDIT 1. Had this indeed been used as the main plot for this movie, I am sure it would have been much more successful. A pity."
2,ALRIGHT I GUESS,"The first movie is much better this was alright not as bad as the third one they made, Its kind of stale from the first one this time instead of beer they are transporting a pregnant elephant. the music is pretty good but they can never redo the first one."
2,What a dud.,"Sally fields is older than the hills and looks every bit of it.One minute Burts in a swamp the next he's in the Utah desert.Guess what there is no desert between Dallas and Florida.This one was a real turd. I really liked the part where the football player flips a 4000 lbs car with one arm. Sheesh, better suited for kids but somewhat racy with the language."
3,Would be 5 stars if not for the typos!,"The information itself is very interesting and presents many cases that I have not found in other publications in the past. However, I would not recommend reading this in the Kindle version as there are many, many typographical errors in the text. With at least one, and up to four words with inappropriate hyphenations on EVERY page (repre-sented, autho-rized, etc.)it is a very tiresome read. These hyphenations are not at the end of lines, but rather in the middle of lines, throughout the entire book. I do recommend reading this book - just not the Kindle version."
1,Don't waste your money,"This is the only book I've read on this subject and it HAS to be the worst. It's laughable .... probably even worse than Casebook on the Men in Black (according to those reviews).If you can actually believe stories about rays shooting out of men's eyes and there eyes turning different colors etc. then go ahead and buy it.It is a piece of junk, from the ridiculous cover art to the absurd stories inside it.Too bad such a piece of garbage was written on a truly fascinating subject ... I'd recommend John Keel over this idiot."
5,"Fast shipping, quality merchandise","The price is extremely reasonable for quality duracell batteries and I was able to purchase several of them for use in the alarm remote of all our company vehicles. They arrived in due time and not only did this seller save us money, but also saved us a trip to the store. I will continue to purchase from this seller again."
2,Price too high for online sales,"As reported for the Energizers I purchased at Amazon, I found these Duracell batteries at an online pharmacy called hocks which had them much cheaper and with my other items had no shipping or tax either. If you have only an order for a battery and will get stuck with shipping, then these prices might be OK, but if you order anything else over some limit ($75??), then the hocks place will ship free and if I remember right it was $1.69 for TWO of these batteries in one package! Can't beat that price."
3,To a fan its listenable,"Steel Pole Bathtub have come and gone, but the Cars covers on this album are always good to listen to."
1,"Boring, beyond belief...","I'm usually on board for anything with Janine. But, this a complete waste of both time, and money."
1,junk,"Extremely small, Barbie-sized tripod. Anything attached to it weighing over a few ounces will tip over. Watch out for breezes and uneven ground. I sent mine back."
4,Pretty good mini tripod,The good:SmallMade of metalGold paintBall mount has a good tightening screwLegs are stable when fully RETRACTEDThe bad:Not ideal for heavy cameras since the legs will retract under the camera's weight when EXTENDEDTripod smells like grease
3,Decent movie,"Movie is decent. Disappointed it didn't stick with the book, but most movies are that way. Love movies with military aircraft, so I'm a harsh critic."
4,"Early ""chick lit""","I enjoyed the book. I think it has a ""mature chick lit"" theme. I do find the comments in the reviews, about how now Charleen would be given Prozac and sent on her way, both insulting and untrue. It is insulting from the standpoint that most competent doctors do not believe medication treats social issues and existential angst. I find it untrue in that Charleen does not appear depressed or anxious; she seems to be redefining herself after her life has been turned upside down, and it takes going back to where she started to find out how far she has come, and how strong and independent she is now. The twists and turns weren't hard to figure out, but didn't seem forced or contrived. I enjoyed the novel. It isn't ritzy or racy, but a wonderful story of growth and acceptance."
3,Not her best work,"This is a very simple read and not very memorable. I found the kidnapping portion of the book to be a bit melodramatic and not fit in to the rest of the story. Good for a quick read during the holidays, but certainly nothing compared to The Stone Diaries."
5,"Warm, funny, wonderful, poignant and very surprising!","All these words describe Carolyn Michael's book Enchanted Companions. But mostly it is full of surprises. None of the stories are predicatable or the sort of stories I would imagine that people would have about dolls. Dolls touch peoples' lives in unexpected ways. My favorites stories were ""George Rufus Yoder"" and ""Bawl Room Dance."" Amazing writing and a beautifully put-together book. I want volume two if there is one!"
3,How to reuse some older ideas,Acquired this book many years ago (early 199x). It was inspiring to read about efforts to produce dedicated hardware for cellular automata. Recently Stephen Wolfram's a new kind of science made me read this older book again. Then it was interesting to write a cellular automata program in C++ and afterwards in a mixed Python/C version. The rules to use were taken from this particular book. The general hardware nowadays has enough power to even program in a higher level language and still show adequate performance. In short: the book is inspiring and the presented rules can be used to investigate cellular automata.
4,tired of winding,"i like how it's easy to let the string out to get height on the kite fast, but it's quite a bit of work winding it back up. might have gone with one that has a reel, but over all it was a good value, easy to use and lots of string."
3,misleading :(,"I wish it was clear that you are only getting one roll, in the picture it shows 4. this is misleading"
5,wow,wow thats alot of string! You can get the kite so high it is scary! Alot of fun for the whole family and it is so much easier than the plastic handle ones that come with the kites.
4,Best Analog TV Ever!,"I've had this TV since 2001 (or so) and I have to say it's the best tube TV I have ever owned or used. I have had ZERO problems with it. It takes a few seconds to fire up, but so does everything else attached to it.Pros:Multiple Inputs. You can never have too many. Best are the component ins, which allow me to use mySamsung DTBH260F.Picture Clarity. I can't watch HDTV with this TV, but when watching downscaled HD programs, the picture is way sharper than I thought a SDTV could be capable of.Good Sound. The speakers are plenty loud and clear sounding.Cons:Certain sound frequencies cause the TV cabinet to vibrate, even at low volumes. I've noticed it's usually female voices. The female investigator on Law & Order, SVU, makes it rattle every time. Other than that, the sound is always perfect.It's Heavy. Not insane heavy, but most people may want help lifting this TV.It will be a bittersweet day when I trade this TV for a flat panel HDTV."
2,Disappointed,The recording quality is marginal and Jesse has difficulty holding notes on several cuts. I have the Best of the Youngbloods and prefer it over this one. Just my opinion but this was a disappointment.
1,won't give you a good workout,"Although Paul has great scenery throughout all his video productions there is no way this can give you a great workout at home.it is a very confusing screen to follow, he sometimes stops his bike and when he does you don't know what to do..This will NOT give you the workout that a spinerval dvd does.I have yet to get my heartrate up to 85% of my max.. The gear display he has is too confusing and the speeds will not get you to where you want to be.If you are just looking for a tape with great scenery this is a good tape to have BUT if you are also looking for a great workout save your money"
1,JUNK! WASTE OF MONEY!!,"I purchased the WNR 3500 router and the WN511T adaptor to support it. Worked well for about a month with the occasional dropped signal. It now drops every hour at least and requires reconnection to the Internet. The latest drivers have been installed, etc, etc. An absolute waste of time and money and the worst network product I have ever purchased."
3,Hard to beat the price,"I have an old Dell Latitude C510/C610. I needed to add wireless at a low price, since I was considering buying a new laptop. The new cards were selling for $65. With the current card, once in a while I have to ""Repair"" the wireless network connection, after rebooting the laptop. Now, I delayed buying a new laptop until the I5 prices drop."
4,Perfect For WIFI Sniffing,"device = 5 stars , software = 1This product is perfect for your wireless security pen tests, but do make sure to get the Marvell TOPDOG driver for it (http://www.wildpackets.com/support/downloads/driver_download/11)you will need that to get the right performance from this device, whether or not you want to use it for other things, get that driver. you will be thoroughly satisfied, it is a work-horse, great range, it is reliable, with the proper driver. one drawback (against the company, not the device) netgear is notorious for bad user interfaces, this is one of those awful interfaces, thats why its a 4 not a five, the topdog driver solves that."
1,"Misspelling on Page 884 ""venajo"" should be ""venaje""","The worst thing a dictionary can do is misspell a rather common word....Page 884 (Spanish) of the 2003 edition has ""venajo"" and it should be ""venaje"" Check Cassell's or Larousse Gran Usual....It is unfortunate that the ""old"" Velázquez is being handled so poorly by the new owners....Mary"
3,typos,"this dictionary is good, but has an amazing number of typographical errors. It needs a new, corrected edition"
4,Worthy of the Jars of Clay mantle,"This disc reminds me A LOT of the first offering from Jars of Clay. Passionate vocals, above average music hooks (choruses) and lots of likeable rough edges with a bunch of room for growth. I was impressed, but not altogether blown away by this disc. The more I listen to it the more I appreciate the CD as a whole. Stand Up seems to be a sure fire aim for radio airplay, but it works well. Stand outs include: Stand Up and Story of a Kid. A good disc to purchase if you need to have a pre ""Much Afraid"" Jars musical moment."
4,Just plain good fun.,"This CD doesn't have the lyrical depth of an offering from, say, Jars of Clay or dc Talk. Nor does it have the intricate musical detailing of either of those artists.But this CD is just plain FUN. I blare it in the car and sing out loud on the way to work. The messages that Everyday Sunday shares are solid, even if simply phrased. Wake up, O sleeper, and rise from the dead, and Christ will shine on you. Everybody's looking around and wants to be found...and I'm just hanging on. I will stand up now; I will not look down; I will do my best to wear this crown...but I need you as you guide me through today.Everyday Sunday is a great guitar-and-drums band. Their lyrics are wholesome, their sound is fresh, and they rock without really telling us why. They just do."
2,ummm,I Give it 2 stars...cuz i dont like it..i would give it one...but im being nice. I got this cd for my birthday...if it were my choice..i probly wouldnt have bought it.Truthfully...im a metal head...anything that has alot of screaming and rocks ur face off!! like disciple. Unfortunatly... this band is not hard enough for me.Some of the songs are OK... alot of them are to slow and melow for my liking. But if ur one to melow out...then get this cd. If ur one who likes to listen to the voices and just sit there and enjoy ur music...get this cd. But for me...im a headbanger. And this cd just isnt for me.
1,Stand Up Blows,"Everyday Sunday is amzing for the fact that they got an A&R drunk enough to give them a record contract. Maybe they're related, I'm not sure. But this cd is terrible. I like Hanging On and Stand Up."
2,Adequate but hardly stirring,"It's difficult to tell what these stories have to do with Bradley's work, or what most of them have to do with any conception of Avalon. A handful are interesting, but most are simplistic or muddled--and few show real skill with words. They could easily have been collected under a different title, suggesting that the titular link to Bradley is more a marketing ploy than a developmental reality. I really don't recommend it."
5,Loved the book,"The stories told did an excellent job of capturing the magic found in Marion Zimmer Bradley's Avalon books. It's a wonderful tribute to her writing style, as well as an excellent resource for authors who are capable of MZB's style"
4,A good read with a lot of variety,"Overall, this was a great book with many interesting stories. Most of the stories were either great, or very pleasing to read. However, the only downfall of this book is the fact that a few not-so-good stories made it tough to read at times."
5,WOW! COOL!!,"I read this book in one sitting. Yeah, I lit a big fattie, which might have made it seem better than it was. I can't tell! I'll have to wait till I die to find out! Jah Love!"
4,Helper,"After my aunt passed away, a friend recommended this book to me. This book was almost a guide book of what could be expected. Since losing my mother and all grandparents, I can honestly say that I have received a little peace."
1,falsehood for sale,"In the spirit of ""tell people what they want to hear"" the author exploits for financial gain those people who are hurting because of the death of a loved one. His intolerance for Judeo-Christian beliefs is evident in his smug attitude of knowing all, coupled with his intolerance for truth, as well as his ""I have no standard of truth, I make up the rules as I go along"" all add up to a waste of both time and money."
1,Reaching To Heaven is anything but.,"Cavaet Emptor! - buyer beware -. The Bible (God's Word for those who have forgotten) warns us about channeling or contacting spirits. The spirit you contact will invariably be a deceiver and this contact will do much more harm than good. Do we really need this in a world already filled with confusion and deception? It is our choice to choose heaven or hell, but do the facts have to be twisted? This book is more a sad commentary on the direction many are choosing than a useful ""guide"" of any kind."
1,"Skip it and Read Altea's ""Eagle and Rose"" instead","You want to read a really good book on paranormal gifts? Then read Rosemary Altea's ""The Eagle and the Rose"", which is extremely well-written and informative, while delivering the chills and thrills.Van Praagh's books (all of them) read like they were transcribed directly from verbal dictation. His descriptions are often vague and repetitive, and not worth your time and money."
2,"Read ""Through the Eyes of Spirit"" by Jenny Crawford","""Reaching to Heaven"" just dosn't seem real somehow!I suggest you read Jenny Crawford's book - ""Through the Eyes of Spirit"" to truly feel the presence and love of those in the spirit world.James Van Praagh's book ""Reaching to Heaven"" sounds a bit stretched in detail to me."
5,reaching to heaven,"Excellent, Simply Superb. James writing comes alive. The feeling I got while reading this book was as if I were sitting there in his living room witnessing every word spoken between James and those who have gone on to the other side. I could not put it down. Reaching to Heaven has more answers than I have questions.If every dollar I spent gave me the same quality of enlightment and satisfaction I received while reading this book I would never hesitate to spend another dime.Can't wait to read his next book."
5,Classic highlights from Yankees baseball,"A half hour program hosted by Mel Allen, this tape is a compilation of the ten greatest moments in Yankees history as decided by readers of the New York Daily News. The most recent is the no hitter pitched by Righetti in 1983. The tape has actual footage from each moment and an intro by Mel Allen. Allen sets the stage for each with his distinctinve voice. For Yankees fans this tape gives you clips of DiMaggio, Mantle, Ruth, Gehrig, Larsen, Reggie Jackson and Bucky Dent all in their moments in the sun. This tape can be watched over and over again."
5,"""White Zombie"" Never Looked Better","The DVD release of ""White Zombie"" does justice to one of the great horror films of the 1930s, not to mention one of Bela Lugosi's finest hours. It looks and sounds terrific. In addition, the supplemental Lugosi interviews are a nice touch. If you never have seen ""White Zombie,"" you're missing one of the most atmospheric and stylish horror films ever made. Transferred from a stunning 35mm print, the Roan Group has done wonders in its restoration of the Lugosi classic."
2,Buy a different version,"I'm not sure why this version of White Zombie is labelled ""enhanced"" -- I bought it expecting a better copy than the three versions of White Zombie that I already own, and instead got a worse copy, dark and grainy and overexposed. It's not horrible, but there are definitely better prints of this film that you can buy at the same price or cheaper. (Note that the other reviews on this page, which rave about the quality of the DVD and the extras, do NOT refer to this copy, but to ""Horror Classics Volume 1: White Zombie."" There are no extras on this DVDR, and the quality is in no way remarkable.)There are probably no really great prints of White Zombie, but you can definitely find a better print than this one. ""The Bela Lugosi Collection"" and ""The Bela Lugosi Box Set: 15 Frightful Films"" both contain slightly better copies, and based on the reviews, I suspect the ""Horror Classics"" version is probably even better. You're better off buying any of those."
3,Not your average Zombie film!,"Love old black and white movies with actors like Bela Lugosi. Although somewhat grainy and sound isn't the best, it is still a classic B horror movie and fun to watch!"
5,"Great deal, great price!","Well, to start off, if you're a horror fan and don't own this movie... get it now! This is a great product. The price was great, the movie quality (considering the year the movie came out) is great, and you get a free t-shirt! The only thing I was a little bummed about is that they package the dvd in one of those thin cases that is half the depth of the usual ones, which isn't really a problem, I just prefer the standard size case. Also, the shirt only comes in a Large. There are no size options. Those are my only two issues, which aren't really issues. I would definitely still recommend picking this up!"
3,Historically the First Zombie Movie Made.,"Viewed: 7/05Rate: 67/05: Labeled the first zombie movie made, White Zombie is fair and coherent for its story. For its slowness, the picture lulled me to somnambulistic mood. There is some nice background drop, especially for the castle. Bela Lugosi isn't so bad in this film, but I feel he is getting carried away way too much with the Dracula thing into this film. Clearly an influence for Night of the Living Dead, White Zombie is inferior to the overall quality that Night of the Living Dead brought to the screen."
2,its missing something,"ok i love white zombie and all however this copy from this exact company isnt good at all ,, teh sound is off and alot softer ,, the drums int eh begginign should thump really loud. Plus the black and white seems a bit bleached out"
2,Did not get the re-mastered edition that I paid for,Does anyone at the Amazon.com warehouse actually pay any attention to what they're mailing? My old VHS edition of this film looks better than the one I bought from Amazon. I did NOT get what I paid for.
3,Good quality DVD,"I like the way this movie has been restored to such good quality. Other than that, the movie is nothing special. Since I'm a big White Zombie(the band) fan, I had to buy this movie for my collection. It is NOT scary at all.On the contrary, Quiet funny at times."
1,"Horrible, horrible sound quality","This review refers to the A2ZCDS.com edition of White Zombie.I am unsure just how this has been remastered, but the background noise on the sound transfer makes it almost unwatchable. Please buy another version of White Zombie if you want to own this wonderful old movie. The Alpha Video release may have breaks in the sound, and at least one in the film, but I can hear the dialog, and at half the price.White Zombie"
3,GOOD HORROR FLICK AT THE RIGHT PRICE,"Bela in the early days is great to see even though he did some interesting films with Ed Wood.. This early 1930's horror/zombie flick set in Haiti with a power mad Bela is great with a seven course dinner which I partake in on a friday night (7 course = pizza + six pack). Don't expect a flashy DVD production with extras (go for other versions that are also available at Amazon). White Zombie is available at $21.49 as a dearer version that includes extras as well. Also Bela Lugosi Collection Volume 2 (currently out of stock) at $16.99 which includes Ape Man/Bela Lugosi Meets A Brooklyn Gorrilla/White Zombie. Hope it will be in print in the near future. See also Bela Lugosi Collection Volume 1 @ $16.99 that is still available and contains Devil Bat and Scared To Death. Back to pizza and beer, see ya."
1,Unfortunate,"Unfortunately, this was not what I expected for a ""Remastered"" version of White Zombie. I was anxious to get this one as I have an older copy from a few years back, and could not wait to get a better copy. The sound quality is a hundred times worse than my older copy of the movie. As soon as I start the movie you hear a very loud hissing sound that is so bad you can barely hear what the actors are saying. Also, as promised there were no subtitles available so I could finally know what the people were saying. I was so looking forward to this dvd and paid $14.95 willingly for a ""good copy"". I don't usually complain about anything, but must about this release. I would not recommend purchasing the remastered version if you already have this movie, not worth the money. I hope someone can come out with a good quality version of White Zombie in the future. -Brenda Mayo"
2,Great film - Bad DVD,"Wonderful movie - Bad DVD, September 14, 2002This is one of the most atmospheric and trend-setting zombie movies ever (and one of the first). Very artful, very well done. But the DVD image quality is lacking. The intrusive artifacts in the image are not the ""old film"" artifacts (dust, scratches, etc.). Instead, the unwelcome artifacts are decisively ""digital""... The remastering process did strange things to the image - and it didn't get encoded very well to DVD. I bought this, loved the movie, but returned it due to the annoying quality of the encoding."
5,Great satire of french society,"This movie is packaged as a silly insight into french society during the 1970s, but it does more than that. It offers a critique of the assumptions that society relied upon to treat women in the manner they did. In doing so, the movie uses a light hearted script and excellent cast to weave the tale of a poor housewife who is not taken seriously by anyone, but her son and one time lover. The movie reveals how she fights these assumptions and is able to overcome the low expectations people place upon her. But it does not do it too seriously and still makes its point. All in all, a very good movie."
3,Feels more like an outline than a fully developed story,"Denueve as an umbrella factory heiress leads to some charming echoes of one of her earliest (and one of my favorite) films,The Umbrellas of Cherbourg, but that charm is wasted on a film that feels more like a sketch or outline than a fully developed story. The characters are flat and the movie just sort of rolls along through the plot points without ever giving the audience a reason to care."
2,Pass on this.,"Catherine DeNeuve is a gem as always, but the rest is a passer. Little value offered here for your money."
3,potiche was ok,Althought Potiche was amusing I think I was expecting a lot more. The story line was good and diverse but it unfolded in such a dated almost 'corny' fashion. (Using corny a dated adj. ). It was hard for me to get past the production.
3,Cute French movie American style!,"A movie with Catherine Deneuve and Gerard Depardieu does not disappoint. The charisma between the two actors is phenomenal and does not fade with time. Both shine as superstars which does not necessarily translate to well to American audiences unfortunately. They are France's equivalent to Streep & DeNiro. The story was, however, lightweight and more of a nostalgia film for these two French co-superstars. I loved watching them together anyway! Fabrice Luchini is really the one who stole the movie as the overbearing factory owner and husband to Ms. Deneuve. He was hysterical and his comedic timing was fabulous which infused life into a borderline dull movie. I was a teenager in 1977 and wore the same kind of clothes in the movie--which at the time thought were so cool!!!"
4,Entertaining French Film,"We had planned to see this film at a local theater but it was so far away that we would have missed the first part of the movie. I checked on Amazon and found it for rent. We streamed it to our laptop and watched it on our flatscreen TV with an HDMI hook-up. The beginning started out blurry but it cleared almost immediately and was so clear that it was possible to read the very small credits at the end of the film. The film streamed seamlessly, although we never tried to pause and resume it. The story was very enjoyable. Catherine Deneuve was gorgeous, as usual and the French subtitles were reasonably easy to read. It was nice to find the exact film we wanted to see at a very affordable price and to watch it in the comfort of our home.Potiche"
3,Potiche,"Potiche was a decent movie however, I am so happy that I did not spend the money to see it in the movie theater. It was a great Saturday night, stay at home movie and the price was right."
5,Magic Cleaning cloth,"If you want clean, smearfree windows or mirrors then you need these cloths. The best thing about them is that you only use water, no chemicals. So they are environmentally friendly. You wet the microfibre cloth, then wipe over with the thinner blue cloth. What could be easier?"
1,Flavorless,"It's a difficult thing to sit down and write a book and I always hesitate to criticize unless I really feel it is needed. This author has all the facts, knows how to write, has picked a new, interesting venue; the adventures of a game warden. But the writing is without flavor. What this book lacks are the answers to two questions: What is it like? - and - What does it mean? What is it like to be in ""Bear country?"" Where is the love or regard for the animals being killed? What is important and personal about doing the game warden's job? There is little introspection from the hero. The prose just goes on and on; facts and more facts, characters and more characters - without ""juice"" and without real life. All this by way of saying, ""IT'S A DULL READ!"" - OR - ""THIS BOOK IS A CURE FOR INSOMNIA!"""
2,Night Game,I struggle to read slow books. And I really struggled in this one. I won't purchase any more of these.
3,Story was predictable and the plotting was jumpy at times,Overall a good read but the plot dragged at times and at others lack continuity. The author's later works are better.
3,Nice Read,"I'll keep buying these as a Daily Deal as long as Amazon offers them. Not sure I ever knew SOU was as active as John Marquez portends, but these are a good escapism vehicle (and a good reminder that it's not nice to mess with Mother Nature)."
1,Dishonesty,"This is a profoundly dishonest book, not only on the subject of Joan of Arc, as seems to have been covered in detail by another review, but also on other topics in which a similar lack of research - and therefore a lack of detailed knowledge - has produced speculation and outright invention. It is another case in which an author gathers a few convenient half-truths and spins them into a story that suits their purpose while ignoring the objective evidence. Unfortunately, such sloppy intellectual habits have become all too common."
1,History,"Ref: Reader from USA, 23 July 99: Sorry, haven't read all the books avail on Joan of Arc yet, but so far she put her clothes (male, if you so wish) back on in prison although they offered her a dress - maybe you wanna do a search on Joan of Arc at Amazon - just a suggestion...Back when I've read this book (three crowns to influence average rating as little as poss - sorry)."
4,Great history,A well written history with self- story to keep you interested. Not a dry read at all. Keeps you wanting more.
4,Great book for writing help,I stumbled across this book and have been amazed at the change in the attitude my homeschooled teenage sons have toward writing. Working through the exercises together has been a real eye-opener as they've learned several techniques for getting their creative juices flowing which has been missing from the myriad writing books we've used over the last ten years or so. They are also getting confident in getting their thoughts down on paper without fear of judgment. Great book.
2,A convoluted introduction,"Although there are useful peices of information to be found in this book, there are also many falsities. Anyone already familiar with the intellectual backwaters of ""scientific illuminism"" and its roots in 19th century ""occultism"" (spiritism, Mesmerism, the teachings of Helena Blavasky, the Golden Dawn, Brotherhood of Luxor, Crowley, etc.) will find little that hasnt been dealt with more thoroughly elsewhere. Full of references to poorly defined and Westernized theories of Karma, Reincarnation, Astral bodies, neoRosicrucianism, and the usual Blavatskyist nonsense."
3,The Alchemists Handbook,"This particular book, though out-of-print, I consider to be the epitome of the Alchemists work. This work allows the reader to find his or her own way to bridge the gap between regular science and metaphysics. The author makes note of the fact that the Alchemists of the past are todays chemists and the astrologers of the past are todays astronomers. Perhaps with more titles such as this we can make physics out of meta-physics. If you can garner a copy I would highly recommend it for the serious scholar of the meta-sciences."
3,"Slim on Theory, Slim on Practicum","Obtained this book many years ago, expecting much more than what was contained therein. This is a good brief introductory book or, perhaps if you are a follower of Albertus' approach, then it is one to round out the collection. In this slim paperback, he reveals a little alchemical history, warnings and something in the way of a simple lab experiment that one can do without any special equipment. Albertus knew many things, but he reveals little here. I walked away from this book feeling a a bit empty, expecting more from one of the 20th century's most notable alchemists. One may garner better information from his old newsletters or magazine articles. A better introductory book of a similar style would be Spagyrics by Manfred Junius, which will keep you busy for a long time."
4,Very good book worthwhile to read,"Why not 5 stars?For two reasons:1) Alchemy (The Weiser Concise Guide Series) by Brian Cotnoir is a better introduction, although, wisely, it contains little about the ""Great Work"".2) The author, Frater Albertus, includes theosophistic (source: Mme H. P. Blavatsky et al) confusion like the notion of literal ""re-incarnation"", something of a ""New Age"" dogma but, alas, an erroneous 19th century amalgamation of the two traditional doctrines of metemphychosis and transmigration.The last sections of the book, beginning with Chapter VII, ""Wisdom of the Sages"", are NOT superfluous but on the contrary contain several strong hints and useful warnings about certain materials and processes of the Great Work.The section ""Alchemy and Philosophy"" in the Conclusion is truly outstanding, showing how some of the theories of modern chemistry can be usefully, harmoniously and seamlessly integrated into the traditional framework of hermetic philosophy and alchemy."
4,one of the most original drawing and spirit pop-up book,"that Alice is a bit Crazy, and the book is wonderful but far away from a classic view of the story and the caracter"
5,Great for the price,"Got this at another merchant for under $350.00. Work's fantastic so far in the San francisco Bay area. Maps appear reasonably accurate and GPS positioning and instructions are precise so far. For the money, it can't be beat. Screen is bright, and touchscreen is easy to use."
1,Worst Technical Support Ever,"I bought my Navman ICN 510 in 2005. 3 months ago I decided to upgrade the maps, because even for 2005 the maps were old.I bought the software from Navman Australia, because I couldn't find it here in the US.After 3 months of constant calls and e-mails to Navman I still cannot update my new software!!! Unbeliavable!In the mean time I bought a Garmin 250. I didn't buy it in 2005 because I didn't know that Garmin was the best brand. I can tell you, my Garmin GPS is easier to use, comes with all maps from US and Canada and has a better interface. You just plug it and use it!If you are wondering if you should buy a GPS, don't buy Navman, buy a Garmin GPS. http://www.amazon.com/Garmin-n%C3%BCvi-3-5-Inch-Portable-Navigator/dp/B000NW0Y9W/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s;=electronics&qid;=1204621036&sr;=8-1"
1,Avoid this thing,"I've had one of these for a little over 2 years. Slow start up, crash prone, outdated maps even when new. Frequently locks up and requires reset and re-entry of route coordinates. Buttons difficult to use-multi-function button extremely sensitive and tough to control. Many better choices on the market."
1,Never Buy From Navman Again,Remeber this....THis company is run by baboons (check previous reviews of their products). Their customer support service is insaine. Once the customer support voicemailbox was full for a week. So no customer could get through. They lie about things they promise in emails.Maps always outadated.GPS position can't hold even on clear days.STAY AWAY FROM NAVMAN!!!
3,Death and the Compass,"Strange, but provides a great platform for analysis of the story by the same name. Well worth the price paid. The discussions that resulted were priceless."
5,Smead White Folders Excellent,The Smead white folders are the highest quality and perfect thickness for my purposes. They are thicker than ordinary interior folders and more durable. They arrived in a timely fashion.
5,avenza up and coming,this is a great melbourne band that is starting to make a scene for themselves. get on board of this great four piece band's hard rock and smooth ballads.
5,The one and only,"Simply put, this is the finest book I've ever found on the subject. Oliver is an adept beer historian, and the style guides are wonderful. I can't maintain the taplist at my restaurant or create beer pairings for tasting menus without referencing this book multiple times. Anther recommendation would be to buy 2, as your first copy will receive a lot of wear and tear!"
4,Incredible detail,"Garrett Oliver's tome is massive. Information provided is some of the best out their and its collection is presented in a style that will keep those interested in beer history glued to its pages. That being said, there were times when I just had to put this book down and start reading something else because it is just so dense with facts. Also I feel that there is an awkward Brooklyn Brewery bias in the book at the end of each beers description. He tends to include Brooklyn in the discussion of ""best beer examples"" for just about every beer they produce."
2,I did not like it at all,"the green creamy paste, did not work for me, hard to handle , and kind of messy, at least for me. I am more used to a ""bain-marie on a stove top "", than using a microwaveable product, though other gigi's product worked fine with me."
1,The most dangerous wax system ever!,"This product is very dangerous. I`ve been waxing for 8 years and never had an accident before. I've bought this product, followed the instructions and the wax blow in my face and arm when I open the microwave. I've got second degree burns and want everybody to know that this product is not safe."
5,"Pure, clean, scary","Whenever I talk about this first album, fellow fans are quick to point out that Suzanne's voice is not yet properly trained, and that the production values are bottom-of-the-barrel. I agree, but I don't care. These songs have a clean, piercing purity which I think is sometimes lost in her later work.This is definitely her edgy-slightly-unhinged folk-singer face, so it may not be for people who prefer her more energetic or sound-oriented work.I also believe that the entire album is an associative poem, but this is still an unverified quack theory."
1,review of the book,"This book is extremely difficult to understand. One of the main reasons is that there are thousands of errors throughout the book. The problems in the book are too vague and nonpractical. When you are tasked with writing a computer program, you must be told specifically what you want. The only positive thing about the book is the creativity of the problems. All said, I pray there are better books available, or another edition is released."
3,Not the best Di Tregarde book.,"Unlike ""Jinx High"", ""Children of the Night"" drags and drags in places (a problem ""Burning Water"" suffers from to a lesser degree). I bought it to read on a plane and found that, several times, staring at the ceiling was more entertaining. When it's good, it's very good, but when it's not, it's quite dull."
4,Fair,For not reading any of her other books and purchasing it out of pure curiousity I'd have to say it's an interesting book with a strong hold on it's plot. Though the story only drew me in the end and the begining was far from what I would expect I still enjoyed it.
4,I Love Mercedes Lackey,"I have, over the course of time, bought many books. I love to read, and I absolutely love Mercedes Lackey's versatility. She has only written a handfull of Diana Tregarde books, 3 in fact with a small handful of short stories. She caught a lot of flack due to the nature of Diana's ""religion"" (If I remember correctly) that she didn't write more. I regret this more than anything, and hope she will reconsider. Mercedes Lackey has written enough books to fill a small library, and I intend to own every book she has ever written by the time I ""go to a better place""! I recommend buying her books any place you can get them."
5,Simply marvelous!,Can't say enough about the Diana Tragarde books except don't stop writing about her. She is a kick butt heroine who can take care of herself!
4,Diana Tregarde books are great,"I really wish that there were more Diana Tregarde books. Since they are being reprinted after so many years, can I possibly hope for more? Soon? The setting and tone of this book differs dramatically from that of ""Burning Water."" In this book, Di is back on her own turf. Readers see more of her past, which makes her character even more interesting. Instead of purposely walking into trouble, trouble finds her. Throw in 3 types of vampires, can you go wrong? The third book is Jinx High, which is also scheduled to be re-released by Tor."
1,I though it was something else,"I thought it was a poster of a picture, but it is actually like a painting, and the paper is not good quality, it's very thin"
2,NOT the Original Version,"This has already been expressed here in the reviews, but just as a reminder one more time..... this DVD is NOT the original version. The original version has more material and is much better. Hopefully someday they'll release an Unrated Version the way it was on VHS at one time."
4,Ahead of it's time erotica,"I first saw this in 1985 when I worked in a video store and then watched it repeatedly. ""Norm"" from ""Cheers"" even has a small role in it. Steven Bauer was an unknown at the time but he's very sexy and it's an entertaining film. If you like his work, check him out in ""Running Scared"", ""Scarface"", ""Primal Fear"", ""Raising Cain"" and ""Traffic"". He was also married to Melanie Griffith years ago. Lucky her. I've also been looking for the soundtrack and saw it in a shopping mall in Denver on cassette about 16 years ago but didn't have any cash to buy it. Bummer. Bored married women will enjoy Barbara Williams' character, who literally escapes from her drab existence and eventually strengthens her marriage by doing so. Good flick. David Caruso from ""NYPD Blue"" had a pretty memorable role as well."
3,Thief,"True 80's love story! Brought back memories of styles, habits, and music of the pass...The me generation!"
1,WHAT A BORE!,This is a sleazy-piece of garbage that is not even good enough for the midnite movie or the late late show!
3,"If you don't like romantic movies, then don't buy this one!","Steven Bauer (later co-starred in Scarface) plays a big-time arts thief who, while ransacking the home of his latest hapless victims, stumbles across the diaries of the wife. Bauer becomes obsessed by the journals and is determined to meet & become the ""perfect"" lover she describes in the logs. The rest of the story is sort of feelgoodish and the ending is even better. I liked this movie because I like Steven Bauer, but I suspect anyone else would enjoy the movie if they have 90 minutes and nothing else to watch."
5,Thief of Hearts,"The movie is great but its not for young viewers under 13 is really pushing it.. the movie has some sexual content and wouldn't even let my 13 year old watch it. Some violence but it has a lesson in the movie also. Crime doesn't pay, and love is blind. Steven Bauer was a hotty, back then ..."
3,it's a good idea,"It is easy to put on and it is easy to use, but everyone's house is different. Heavy rain will create a pool of water around my downspout, and I got this to direct the water away from my house. Sadly, it only takes the water, slowly a few feet away, and although it helps a bit, it isn't the real solution I need."
3,Too big,"These downspouts are great, except they are twice the size of residential drain pipe that you get at home improvement stores. The collar that attaches to the down pipe is roughly five by three. It will attach but is not a proper fit."
2,Will not fit round downspouts; needs maintenance,"I ordered this downspout extension after reading on Amazon's product description page that it ""fits either 2"" X 3"" to 3"" X 4"" downspouts."" To me, this sounded like a universal fit that might apply to my 2"" round downspout, and it was impossible to tell from the accompanying photo whether it would fit a round downspout or not. Well, it wouldn't, not even close, and the seller is making me pay for the shipping and handling to send it to me ($7.65) plus my cost to ship it back to them.Another problem with this item that didn't become quite clear until I got it is that it's open on the top, which would allow leaves and other debris to accumulate in the trough. I had been planning to use it under some bushes near a corner of my porch that I rarely visit, and what I really needed was a covered tube to carry water away from my house, something that wouldn't require regular maintenance."
2,Great idea but...,...the downspouts are displaced by wind. The extensions are completely blown off in wind. If you live in a place where the wind never never blows these are probably great. For those of us who live in the real world they are pretty much a waste of money. I would have paid twice as much for a heavier more durable product. In fact I'm still looking for same.
5,Great product,"This downspout extension is just what we needed to solve our downspout problem. We needed something that swiveled in case we needed to access the ground under the spout, and we needed an adjustable length that could be shortened when we needed to cut the grass. Keeping in mind that it is plastic, it is sturdy and well-made. The brown color blends into the landscaping. We have had a lot of rain this winter, and it has worked perfectly."
4,"Big robot great, small one, not so good","My boyfriend loves his robot, the large one does all kinds of things, but it's kind of difficult to figure it all out, there are tons of buttons, and you have to switch colors for different things. He talks, walks, dances, picks light items up...it's really quite fun! The small robot is suppose to walk, but doesn't, so it was disappointing, but the way I see it, he was just a bonus, so it didn't really bother me."
3,Ok but not the best,"Quality not the best, however, probably worth the price. It seems to clog more than the original head. This could be from the cheap round string that it came with(I prefer the better-cutting square string) or a larger gap between the head and the bottom of the shaft that allows long grass to wrap around the shaft and cause friction on the spinning head."
4,Was exactly what I needed,"I had thought about ditching my old Homelite trimmer when the string stopped feeding reliably. After installing the new trimmer head, however, I am back in business and saved myself about $150 for now."
3,Had Brighter Moments,"This book was up and down for me. At times, it was exciting and ""wow, that can happen?"" At other times, that was not the case. I think there were a lot of inconsistencies and far-fetched assumptions that got the plot to where it was. I don't know all the nitty-gritty details about aviation technology, but I'm pretty sure the wild events taking place in this book could not spiral as far out of control as they did. Either way, I would recommend reading it and making your own opinion."
2,Disappointing!,Rip the first 300 pages! Nance apparently are too upset about deregulation and spent the first 300 pages creating an outrageous airline which is a product of deregulation. He tries to make its employees as bad as possible to the extent that it is just unbelievable.I am a Nance fan but this one is just too un-Nance style. If you want to try his books look for Scorpion Strike. It is the best.
2,Interesting but ultimately choppy and wooden,"Interesting premise, but Nance unfortunately writes his characters as black or white - either poor victims or outrageously mean and nasty airline employees, and neither rings true. The novel almost reads like a parable masquerading as an act of fiction, but the dialog is so choppy and repeats so often (if you had a nickel for everytime a character says ""Sorry?"" in response to another character you'd probably equal Nance's royalties from this book) that this novel ultimately lands with a thud. If you don't mind overlooking such flaws then go ahead and enjoy yourself, but I really expected a lot more. I actually thought the first chapter was pretty well written, which is why I bought this in an airport, but as soon as I dug into it I realized the rest of the novel from a stylistic perspective quickly goes downhill. Plot is interesting though."
3,Pure Nance,"A lot of fiction. A lot of ""last minute"", hard to believe and unexplained events. Otherwise, good page turner. Could be a good movie, ""Airport"" style."
5,"If you loved ""Time and Again"", you will love these stories","I have read this book twice - so far. Some truly charming stories that, as was the case in the novel ""Time and Again"", encourage one to see the past with new eyes. I can honestly say that my perception of the past (and, consequently, the present) has been enriched by these stories. I especially loved the stories of the house that received a second chance, and of the car vintage car that gives its riders a second chance. I have recommended this book to many of my friends."
4,Fascinating!,"Jack Finney's short stories on time and the characters that occupy it are a fascinating pleasure. Savor each one as the gift that it is, and take the journey through time. I couldn't put it down - and think of it often."
4,Gentle Journeys into Nostalgia,"This collection of stories represent a longing for a gentler, simpler time. Each explores the elements of ""what might have been"", whether it be in the protagonist's own life, or the difference of ages.One story explores what might have been, if a man had made different choices in his own life and through that journey, he finds contentment in the life he did choose.Another explores trust and what might have been if only modern man could learn to believe. How much can be lost because we cannot.Others deal with the link that places and things may have with our past and the wonder of discovering such links.Taken together, the anthology offers something for all . . . nostalgia, philosophy, near future 'end of the world' scenarios, etc. This collection is not for the hard science fiction reader, but for the gentle reader who dares to ask ""what if""."
4,A fun read! (Even if you don't like sci-fi),"These 12 short stories represent a large variety of genres: history, science fiction, fantasy, mystery, ect. And you don't have to be familiar with the conventions of science fiction to read them.The characters are everyday people faced with unusual circumstances. Often this involves time travel, but in most cases, the transportation to another time is accidental. I also liked the historical ""flags"" within the stories. It's fun to read the clues Finney gives us and guess the time period the story is set in.All in all, this book can be taken as a whole or as 12 individual stories. It's great for a quick 15 minute break or a long car trip. Give it a try!"
4,"ABOUT TIME ,12 SHORT STORIES",THESE ARE SOME OF THE MOST INTERESTING AND FUNNY STORIES THAT FALL UNDER THE TIME TRAVEL CATAGORY AND I LOVE ALL THINGS TIME TRAVEL.SOME OF THESE STOREIS I'VE READ IN OTHER STORIES AND MOST WERE NEW TO ME I REALLY LIKED THIS BOOK.I GAVE 4 STARS.
5,Jack Finney,I love time travel stories and consequently I bought this collection of Finney's. I would recommend Finney to anyone looking for good reading.
2,Maybe just not for me,"I thought the short stories would be fun, but it really wasn't for me. Not many of the stories were that good and was hoping for more stories with time travel (not the case). Seems there were about 20 short stories in the book and I only thought about 5 of them were great, the rest were average and I just skimmed through them."
4,Dylan's Best Since Blood on the Tracks,"As another reviewer here has correctly noted, listening to recent Dylan can be a frustrating experience - some good songs, a few great ones, much filler, and not much cohesion. Infidels largely escapes this fate, however; the great songs are great indeed (Jokerman, Sweetheart Like You) and most of the rest are very good. More importantly, though, this album feels whole, not thrown together, and the lyrics, singing, and playing have an intensity to them, as if Bob wanted to make sure the message got through. What is the message? Watch your back and keep your nose clean, I take it - ""People smile to your face but behind your back they hiss,"" and ""Sometimes Satan comes as a man of peace,"" to give but two examples. Maybe not Dylan's most profound message, but not bad advice either."
5,Bob Dylan is a genius,He never disappoints-even my 19 year old son approves. I have been listening to Bob for 50 years and first saw him in concert in 1963. This is one of his classics.
3,A potential masterpiece murdered in its infancy,"What could have easily been one of Dylan's greatest albums was mangled by the man himself, and what has he left us with? A perfectly respectable effort highlighted by the brilliant ""Jokerman"" and the lovely ""Sweetheart Like You,"" both of which have to carry the ball for mediocre scribblings like ""Union Sundown,"" ""Man of Peace,"" and the dreadful ""Don't Fall Apart On Me Tonight."" By dumping a couple of these less than memorable tracks, and including ""Blind Willie McTell,"" ""Foot of Pride,"" and perhaps ""Someone's Got a Hold of My Heart"" (all of them available on ""The Bootleg Series Vol. 1-3""), this would be right up there with the best of the best. If there was ever an album in need of restoration and re-release, it's this one."
3,What about bob?,Ok he sort of looks like a bearded tom cruise in the picture. Maybe its just the glasses??It sound just like most bob. He can really string together decent tunes. It came out in the 80's and musically sounds that way. The cd does feature some slid guitar going on in the background.
2,let's be honest,wow - reading the reviews here it strikes me that the forum is populated only by Dylan obsessives. To me this is a musically average album with the odd beautiful song among many - well - just average compositions.Sweetheart Like You is beautiful but don't songs like Union Sundown sound as clumsy as any eighties songs with contemporary political messages?Why can't dylan lovers simply acknowlegde he did good bad and average work and this is decidedly in the middle to latter category.
4,A MASTERPIECE BY ANY OTHER PERFORMER...,"Somewhere out there in Bootleg land is an electric version of Blind Willie McTell and of course, the version of Foot of Pride on the Bootleg collection, which were left off of the final product. Instead, Union Sundown is included. This is a great album with better production than Dylan is used to, a great group of musicians, and fantastic vocals by the much maligned singer. Mark Knopfler provides some nice licks on guitar. Jokerman, I and I, Sweetheart Like You, and Don't Fall Apart on Me are all excellently rendered here. The inexplicable exclusion of the aformentioned cuts notwithstanding, this is a great album that has not worn out its welcome on my disc player, even many years after its release. Bob, I would love to hear you do Don't Fall Apart on me LIVE!"
2,They can't all be classics.,"The first time I heard a track from the album was when a friend played ""Don't Fall Apart on Me Tonight"" on acoustic guitar. I fell in love with the mood set by the song and bought the CD (after many previous Dylan purchases) believing the song would be joined by others of similar emotive quality. Unfortunately, I was disappointed by the album. I appreciate that Dylan was making social observations on other tracks (although many were too subtle for this mid-twenties fan) but the songs do not contain the folk starkness of his early albums nor the burning rock melodies of other work. Someone has to note that this album lacks the stripped-down honesty and the ear-cathing riffs that make Dylan special. Most reading this review will be looking for compliments for the album, but (especially newer fans) I recommend picking a different album. Try the Live '66 concert and the Free Wheeling Bob Dylan for intimate performances)."
3,I do believe I've had enough,"I was in New York City when I bought this album. Unfortunately. bringing it back home has made this album less and less... something. I can't say what. The songs are among Dylan's most impressive from a literate stance but hearing the outakes from ""The Bootleg Series"" just lessens the power of the album, it points out what is missing. Maybe the performances are weak and uninspired. But not that much. Maybe... I can't say for sure why it fails when on paper it ought to work. I regret that this album has failed him. Or me. Too bad I'm not going back to New York City."
4,"A great album, could have been one of his greatest","If anyone from Columbia Records is reading this PLEASE listen! You recently re-mixed and re-released Street Legal. With Infidels, you have *much* better material to work with, and the chance to release one of BD's greatest albums. Here's all you need to do:1) Re-mix the album so that Jokerman (one of his greatest songs ever), Sweetheart, I and I, etc. have better sound quality than the original release2) Add the amazing songs that were inexplicably left off the original release: Foot of Pride, Blind Willie McTell, Someone's Got a Hold of My Heart, and Lord Protect My Child3) I also understand there was a great song he did a great song called ""Julius and Ethel"" about the Rosenbergs -- let's hear it!4) Release the album, then sit back and read the outstanding critical reviews, and watch the sales go through the roof!Please, drop me a line if you have any questions..."
2,Not a good place to start,"This is a painfully average Dylan album. If you're new or fairly new to the great man, this is no place to start. There's one great song - Jokerman. Aside from that there are are 2 or 3 others that are worth listening to a few times: Sweetheart Like You, License to Kill and Don't Fall Apart On Me Tonight. The rest is mediocre and second rate. If you're already familiar with a dozen of his classic and near-classic albums and want to fill in the gaps, then you should look into it. Non-essential Bob, this one. If you're looking for an introduction to 80s Bob, start with the much superior (but short of classic) No Mercy from 1989."
3,It's misunderstood.,"Ok, I shouldn't really write anything since I have only listened to the album online. However, I gotta say that Union sundown ain't a nationalistic/protectionistic song, it's just pure anti-capitalism! :o) I feel that too many of the songs, except for the 3 first ones, are a bit too monotoneous. Well, Neighbourhood bully has an excelent message written in a prophetic and poetic way, it's so true what he sings there! Sweetheart like you is beautiful, Jokerman is lovely of course, there's a heavenly atmosphere in the end of the song that can also be heard in every grain of sand. The lyrics of I and I are wonderful too!"
4,Fluid Pianist,Dennis DeSouza plays a similiar piano style to Stanley Black or it could be Vice Versa. This Guyanese pianist is a very good West Indian muscian with many of it rythyms and beats. It hard to locate many of his earlier albums.
1,"I recently bought this TV, and 2 days later I'm returning it","This TV has a very good picture for regular TV, and composite inputs. But, I did not buy it to watch regular cable TV, or to watch old VHS tapes. I bought this TV because I wanted a pretty high end, normal TV with component inputs to play my Xbox on.I was very displeased to find that when using component inputs and playing the Xbox, numerous wave-like distortion lines appeared over the picture, but when I removed the component cables from the TV, they dissapeared. After having browsed through some online forums, I found that many people have had compatability issues with Sony TV's and the Xbox. If you plan on using the Xbox with component inputs (or maybe even composite) stay away from this TV, because it will end up dissapointing you as far as picture quality is concerned. The audio of a TV is trivial to me, because I usually mute the TV sound when I'm using my surround system (which is often)."
3,geology book,Good book but too brief. This is not a Geology text book but a brief introduction to Geology. It is a good book to use as a supplement to a more complete geology book.
4,Conceal Carry,This holster is very well made and gives great button retention. Only downfall is that it sticks out a little further than I would like it to for concealed carry.
5,My kids loved this CD,I saw Miss Anna Stange at the South Florida Folk Festival and bought this CD. My kids just love it. They want to play and sing along with it all the time. It's a great part-time baby sitter.
3,Incomodos,"Los zapatos son muy bonitos, pero sumamente incomodos, para ser de esta marca uno no espera eso. A las pocas horas de tenerlos puestos no me los soportaba."
5,Great Quality,"My grandaughter love Selena and it is hard to find her CD's on the shelf at the store so I figured I would shop Amazon. I had to go through a seller to purchase, and was very pleased with the price, time to deliver and the quality of the product. I am very satisfied with this purchase."
5,I love Selena!,"I knew I had to just listen to this cd. I didn't really buy the cd, but I borrow it from the library. This album is the greatest hits collection from Selena. I love La Carcacha, Si Una Vez, Baila Esta Cumbia, Amor Prohibido, Bidi Bidi Bom Bom, Buenos Amigos, Dreaming of You, and I Could Fall in Love...hell...I love most of the songs on this album, but I wish I had a DVD player to see the music videos. I would buy this album with the Greatest Hits cd. I miss Selena very much. I wish I get to hear more of hear currently. She's so special!"
3,Very fine effort and bonus DVD too. But...,"this is strickly a compliation. Don't befooled by the packaging. But it still worthhaving. Her Corpus Christi grave still drawsfans last respects every week! Rest in peace,princess!"
1,Not recommended,"I work at the Wherehouse and I've heard this CD a few times. It's not very good. I'm a fan of her rancheras, none of which ever make it to these new releases. Which is a shame, because there was more to Selena than cumbias and all these pop remixes. I think the complaints about there being so many ""new"" albums without any actual new songs are justifiable. And I don't believe that anyone who has given this CD 5 stars was a fan when she was alive. You would think she was bigger than Elvis by reading some of these reviews. Selena came to Tucson for a concert back in '94 and only about a hundred people showed up. More people showed up last year at the New West to watch 50-year old Joe Lopez perform."
1,will never buy tube TV again- BUY AMERICAN!!!!!!,"My TV lasted less than three years, right before the warrenty scam was to expire..... got NO satisfaction from the store (...) nor from the manufacturer...and then somehow I got some class action from some hotel chain that bought a bunch of these and had sound problems so they sued GE.....of course all we ""won"" from this ""lawsuit"" is some sort of cheapo discount......The BIGGEST problem was the picture tube, it wasn't soldered correctly.....the (...)!!! Ours would come and go after about 2 years....The NEW flat LCD screens are coming out this spring, we're watching our old 19"" TV until then.....I want to buy a well made AMERICAN made LCD TV....."
2,Hunk of junk,"It was fine for 6 months. Then different corners of the picture would tint green, blue, or reddish. Tech came to look at it while under warranty--said it was an electromagnetic field. I let it go, since it was an occasional thing. Big mistake.A month after the warranty period, the picture completely disappeared. Sound was fine. The blackouts came infrequently, and then very frequently. I checked the net for other people's experiences--whacking it was the consensus.So I do (whack it), and maybe it helps, I dunno. It could be like the ""door close"" button on elevators, having no effect but there for psychological reasons only. Whacking it decreases my hatred for this model just a bit, so I'll keep doing it."
3,"GE 27"" Color TV 27GT722","Paid $199.99. Good TV for the price. Decent picture, color. First 1 1/2 years without any problem. After that a minor problem with component soldering. Fixed myself and still OK so far. It's been about 3 years with me now."
2,Fuzziness in Petri Nets,I have currently read only the first two chapters of the book and I am already not liking it. The book is full of typos. There are soooo many of them and it is really annoying. The problem is that the typos are not only things in the text you can kind of ignore but they are also in the equations.I cannot comment on the contents yet. The first two chapters seem OK but that's just the introduction material.
5,Soldier's Heart Review,"""Soldier's Heart"" is powerful and vivid account of Sgt. Lee Burkins' (ret.) experiences during the Vietnam War and his battle to regain his humanity after it.""Soldier's Heart"" pulls no punches as Burkins takes his readers from the rotten jungles of South East Asia to the V.A. physiatrist's couch in Hawaii. At times graphic and always intense this book pulls you into the realities of war and doesn't let go.Burkins does not only addresses the issues of anger, frustration and abandonment that many veterans feel but offers practical and sound advice that applies veterans and anyone looking for ways to overcome mental, emotional, and physical wounds.This book is a must for all modern warriors.Isaac KaminsMartial Arts Instructor. San Francisco, Ca."
1,Unhappy Customer,"I Had a bad experience with this seller. First of all, the description is deceiving, it states you get 12 bottles and charges you for the appropriate weight of 12 bottles, but they actually only send you one bottle. Then on top of, they did a horrible job packing the bottle, arrived broken. dripping all over the place because they put in a oversized box with little wrapping, which allowed the bottle to be thrown all over the box. Very deceiving seller. Not happy with the whole transaction, will never buy from this seller again."
5,Hot Date for Mac; Why is it taking so long?,"I have played this game once on PC and found it to be the best and most fun Sims yet (and that includes Vacation). Although, it greatly angers me that Maxis is taking so long to make this game available for Macintosh. This game was supposed to come out May 1st, but Maxis decided to give themselves another month. I find that rude and lacking intelligence for many people own Macintosh computers and would like to play (and of course pay for) this game. But yes, I do reccomend to all Mac users to purchase this game when it finally comes out because it is really great. There are so many new objects, skins, and choices for your Sim families."
3,Fun but hard to find a date,"This game is quite fun! You are able to do the most stuff with it. It is the first time that Aspyr came up with the concept to get the Sims 'out of the house'.However, I have played this game for hours on end and still haven't been able to get a loving relationship. Its quite hard. Maybe I am doing something wrong."
2,"The application ""The Sims Hot Date"" has unexpectedly quit...","I'm not going to bombard you with a bunch of techinical junk you won't understand, but I have an Apple that's newer than the game, and I can't play for five minutes without a crash. The Buy and Build modes usually work fine, as long as you're not using the new Downtown feature. If you start the Live mode, however, it will ""unexpectedly quit"" before you've played two minutes. DON'T BUY THIS GAME! Sorry, Amazon.com, but Apple users should stick with house party. I would have given this one star, but it's an excellent concept, and, theoretically, you could play for hours."
1,Beware if you have an older system,"Beware--despite the fact that my computer apparently met the system requirements for this software, it crashed my computer upon installation and I had to pay a repairman ... to restore my system. I've since heard that other people have had similar problems with this software--but when I called Aspyr for technical support (before calling the repairman in desperation) they said they'd never heard of such a thing--it must be a coincidence (!)."
1,This is technological discrimination!!!!,"WHY is The Sims Hot Date the newest, coolest, most popular new Sims expansion for Apple, when, to PC users, Vacation is old news and Unleashed is dead ahead? Anyone? I didn't think so. Apple is THE computer of the future, and it's not fair that we Mac users have to wait MONTHS for the best games, and when they (the games) DO come out, there are always technical problems. Hot Date, Civilization 3, Sim Theme Park and Black and White are some of the technologically demanding games that will force you to download patches, crash your computer, and make you spend hours on installation."
5,Hot Date for Mac,"I'm fourteen but I didn't want to create a new account with Amazon, so here I am on the kids reviews. From what I have read in the past few months, this game looks like it will be the best expansion yet for The Sims. It's too bad that it is released so much later than the Windows version, but it just gives people something more to look forward to! I will definitely buy this game, and maybe Prima's Official Stradegy Guide for it."
3,America's Favorite weatherman pens first novel...,"To be honest I read this book because I enjoy Willard Scott on NBC's Today's Show and other endeavors. I found the book entertaining and tried to figure out ""who done it."" It also caught my attention because I too would like to own a B&B somewhere. Perhaps not in Virginia but in upstate New York. All that on the side ""Murder Under Blue Skies,"" was a good read but not what I would call a page turner until near the end when the killer was about to be caught. This was the first Stanley Waters mystery. ""Murder in the Midst"" which follows is next on my to read list."
1,Boring and predictable...,"This book was awful. I bought it because a book written by Willard Scott, a funny and likeable weathercaster, looked like a good shot. As the old saying goes, Willard shouldn't give up his day job just yet. His writing skills leave alot to be desired. This book was awful. Did I say that before? Well, that's the way his book reads..."
1,A long and uninteresting account of Japanese Castaways...,"Storm Rider is a long and uninteresting account of Japanese Castaways and their attempts to return home. The story becomes very repetitive and boring and has the effect of wearing down on one's patience. If you want a better book try Runaway Horses by Yukio Mishima, try not to waste your time on this one."
1,Foster needs to stick to film novelizations,"The spellsinger series reads like a bunch of smug nerds playing dungeons and dragons. Foster has serious continuity problems (salamanders, sorbl eating mice ect.) Also he needs someone to explain to him what a bass is, as opposed to an electric guitar."
4,greate,this was my first time ordering anything online and I was extreamly worried that I would be Scammed--but everything i ordered came within a week in the exact represented condition I am so impressed and will be ordering again soon.
1,I want my $18.95 back,"Amazon needs to update its rating system to include minus stars for books like this. How this stinker ever got published is a mystery to me. Walker cobbles his narrative together from a handful of secondary sources (Bruce Catton, D. S. Freeman, Gregory Urwin), has apparently never heard of the ""Official Records"" or regimental histories or ""Gettysburg Magazine"", spends 11 pages in a confused and and mostly wrong retelling of his ""subject"", and sets up this chapter with 125 pages of an irrelevant (and often wrong) summary of Lee's command of the Army of Northern Virginia. He knows just about nothing of the Civil War and detracts, rather than adds to the literature of the conflict. As a retired Army officer and professional historian I symbolically throw my hands skywards in dispair."
2,Not worth reading,"This subject is in need of serious study but Walker doesn't provide it. Nothing at Gettysburg makes any sense if ""Picket's Charge"" is all that Lee could think to do on the third day. The CSA cavalry is usually dismissed because of Stuart's trip around the east side of the Army of the Potomac. Given Lee's lack of documentation for his decisions it is easy to miss the long move that Stuart made to get east of the battle where Pleasonton sent Custer in to stop him. Had Custer not aggressively pitched in and kept Stuart out of the main battle, the end might have been much different.Walker however does not provide good sources for his judgements. For example, no citation is offered for research into the Official Records of the Rebellion. Citation of Ambrose's modern-biased version of Custer's battles indicates that even that source wasn't fully understood."
5,"beautifully written lyrics, music",My niece gave this as a present to my daughter and we both love it. The title is fitting for the collection of songs. It teaches about conservation and respect for the earth.
4,It's Friendlier like Moonboat,I Like This Album As Well as Moon Boat because they are both more nostalgic than Family Tree or Billy The Squid. I also Like Both Albums because they help me bring back memories of the time when on PBS They had the Blue P Head Logo with The Bell String Tune and the male announcer saying This Is PBS.
2,"wrong edition, delayed shipping, no communication","The title of this review says it all. I had requested the 1989 edition of this book, which is where the seller had advertised. The 1959 edition came three days after the suggested delivery date which was January 19th; thus on January 22nd the book finally came after a purchase date of December 23rd. After three pleading emails for information on the shipping delivery, no response was ever received."
3,Entertaining but too long,"I really enjoyed the beginning of this book. I've hiked in Sequoia and Kings Canyon and Mineral King. I know the beauty of the area and admired the author's guts to hike alone in the back country and her courage and will to survive her ordeal. The end of the book had too much reflection and was too philosophical for my taste, Frankly, I would have thought it a more human story with less reflection about herself and more about the relationship with her teen aged son who surely went through his own ordeal while his mother went through her healing process. She barely mentions him. The very end is nice and I was glad to see her return to the life she loves."
4,Out There,"This book arrived on time and in good condition. The story was interesting, although to my tast it spent too much time focused her recovery where as I would have liked more about what it was like out there."
2,I got lost too...,"I would have to agree with the other two star reviews here. Way too much of the book was spent going on and on about her feelings, beliefs, etc. The actual survival story and what she achieved is no doubt amazing but I really struggled to stay engaged. So much so that I abandoned the read.I have a lot of respect for what she did and those that helped her, but it wasn't very well written and much of the book is not about the actual event itself."
3,A nice hiking/accident tale cluttered with too much woo woo,"While I enjoyed the book and the core story of hiking and the fall and rescue, I have to say that I was put off by all the irrationality displayed by the author. The author and editor probably should have done a companion woo woo book so as not to detract from the main story being told.My $.02"
4,Angels in the Wilderness: The True Story of One Woman's Survival Against All Odds,This book is well written and because I have backpacked many of the places where this women hiked and I could visualize it in my mind as I read. Also reading about her inner strength of survival is very life encouraging.
2,Could benefit from another edit...,"While we can all agree that ""Angels in the Wilderness"" is the tale of the author's heroic tenacity and the equally heroic response of strangers and friends alike, I cannot agree that it is an interesting read.I too was hooked from the first page. Unfortunately, after the third page, the author leaves her hook (the fall and stunning injury) and instead concentrates on her life history and personal philosophy. This goes on far too long, forcing me to continually fight to keep reading. My interest only resurfaced with chapter 17 and the beginning of Amy's rescue.There is hope. Honestly, there is a very good story here. If the author were to work with an editor to trim the fat from this amazing tale, it could become a story for any reader. As is, it may appeal only to diehard solo hikers and those who know Amy personally.Meanwhile, I look forward to the next edition and continue to pull for Amy's continued recovery.Keep fighting Amy:)"
3,ok book. Not great.,"Initially exciting as the author describes the accident and her thoughts, feelings and experience as she waited for rescue, the book later devolves into minute details of dealing with the healthcare system. This bogged the book down greatly. I didn't finish it. I was too bored."
4,for all fans concerned about HISTORY,"This film is poorly edited and has bad music, but it is history and it ROCKS.Abbie was put through hell until his death (or murder) and all because he cared about PEOPLE period. Well no he cared an awful lot about the earth as well, the man had more than 3000 pages of F.B.I. files, and don't let the later documentary from A.E. lie to you, let him tell his story.He speaks here in an abandoned warehouse as a man disrupted and almost destroyed- which was the aim of the governments cointelprogram. Poor Abbie I never met him but I miss him and love him. He wrote 5 excellent books about this life and the struggle against imperialism, yet when they made a movie about his life they ad libbed all the damn dialogue YUK."

5,A Wonderful and Exciting Book!,"Alex Hardy is much more into soccer than horses, so lately he hasn't been spending much time at the stable while his sister, Kate, practically lives there. He's trying to raise money for a soccer tour in South Africa. He wants to go on the tour he's trying to raise money for he finds the perfect plan- he'll buy a pony, fix it up, and sell it! The small New Forest pony he buys is anything but perfect: he may have to be put down. Alex slowly retrains ""Puzzle"" until he's won the a big show! Puzzle and Alex become very attatched to each other.Meanwhile, he hasn't exactly told his parents about Puzzle yet. When his parents do find out, that are angry and tell him he has to sell Puzzle. Alex is heartbroken. Puzzle is so special to him now. No one at the stable wants to see the little horse go, but maybe that's not enough. Will Alex have to courage to say good bye to Puzzle- forever?"
3,Tiffany - self destructive???,"The only way I read this book is because it was the book of the month for my book club. I admire a strong business-minded person, and Tiffany started off in this role, then floated through the story until the end trying to figure out how to keep her business afloat. She behaved more like the youngest child in her family instead of the oldest. She caused the broken relationships within her family by not waiting on proof from one encounter with her fiancee, Malik, with her sister, Kamille. She also had self destructive relationships with G-dog and his father, Gregory Haney II (and Leila). Tiffany was not grounded and chose alcohol as a refuge. Her nightclub was a success in spite of Tiffany, but the end led you to believe that she is not satisfied with a happy ending and is headed for more self destruction by starting a new business and maybe having another love encounter with the dishonorable Gregroy Haney II."
1,Did we all read the same book?,"I can't believe we all read the same book. There is plenty of edgy AA erotica out there without having to tolerate this one.The main character has NO development except for tantrums and self-discipline that would compare with a preschooler. There is no explanation about how she manages to hook the Harvard Law guy -- in real life he'd run fast from this girl. She appears to be unlikeable and self-absorbed; guess what, author, only pretty and hot gets you nowhere.No romance here. Just some fairly-well written sex, some drugs, and *nobody* you'd like to meet in real life.Went straight to the trash can. I like my fiction to have somebody to root for."
3,Freaky!,"This was my second attempt to read Ms. Thomas' work. I did finish this book, but I didn't find it overly great. I don't know much about drugs but if a low self-esteem person read this, they would definitely want to try drugs. Just my thoughts."
3,good read,i just finished this book and it was okay not bad at all. it is a page turner once some drama goes down and how tiffany the main character gets caught in her situations and at the end it makes me wonder will they be a sequel... only time will tell that but this book is pretty hot with the sex scences but its good story.
4,THIS WAS A HOT BOOK!,I DONT KNOW ABOUT YALL BUT THIS WAS HOT.I HAVE WENT ON & READ MORE FROM HER WHICH WAS DAMN GOOD.....ALL I CAN SAY READ FOR YOURSELF!!
3,Five is Enough,"I read this book because it was the sequel to ""Threesome"", and ""FourPlay"" - which were two good books. I really did not enjoy The Velvet Rope to much.Tiffany has left Platium Images and decided to open her own nightclub with her fiance' and couple of other friends. Things decided to take a twist and not go as planned.Tiffany and her fiance' is not together, and she begin to date someone who is no good for her. She then gets involved with the wrong type of people and then things began to get out of hand.This did not have much sex appeal as the other two books, but it was quite interesting. I encourage reader to read all three books. I will continue to read book from Brenda L. Thomas."
3,This is My First...,"time reading one of Brenda Thomas' books. Unfortunately, I wasn't too impressed, considering Brenda seemed to rely heavily on sex to get her book over. I don't know, it's beginning to feel like urban fiction is turning more into written porn, instead of GOOD STORYTELLING. A true sign of a good book is when an author can balance the 2.I won't waste time by repeating what the book is about, because it's been said by others. So I'll just say that, Brenda made a point of describing, Tiffany as an intelligent woman at the beginning of her book. And then spent the rest of the book having, Tiffany behave extremely foolish. Which just didn't add up for me."
3,I need a barf bag!!!!,Length:: 1:37 MinsI would compare The Velvet Rope to a bad Hollywood horror movie. You know the type (black folk can relate to this) of movie where the victims are so incredibly stupid that you are yelling at the screen pleading for the ax murderer to kill them because they deserve to be murdered for their stupidity.Watch the video to see the rest of this review...
3,All That Glitters Really Isnt Glam Within the Velvet Rope,"This was the first book I have read by Brenda Thomas and enjoyed it. The Velvet Rope centers around the life of Tiffany Johnson, a 20 something PR agent turned club owner. Tiffany partners with her fiance and sister to open a night club in Philly. Before the club opens, Tiffany gets a ear full when she overhears her fiance and sister speaking on a secret that they must tell Tiffany. Tiffany is devastated. The man she loved and the sister she cherished betray her in the worse way. Tiffany's life spins out of control as she gets loose and caught up in the world of sex, drugs, and videotape. Will things work out in the end? Will she rekindle with her fiance and get her sisterly bond back? Go behind the Velvet Rope to find out."
3,The story is pretty good.,"While the animation is not as awesome as the two 3D cell shaded movies, the story is pretty decent. Worth a look if you enjoyed the two 3D flicks and want more in the same universe."
3,"Cheap, however.....","These aren't expensive but they are more narrow than most lightsticks, therefore they are slightly dimmer than most. That doesn't bother me much but it may be a problem for some people."
5,fantastic,This series should never of been taken off the air.Miami vice in my opinion was a classic show.
3,Smuggler's Blues - Brothers in Arms,"If these can't be released in video, then Miami Vice is suffering a great injustice. These 2 episodes were the BEST of the entire series: ""Smuggler's Blues"" - great Glen Frey audio when the plane is on the deserted runway. ""Brothers in Arms"" - breaking through the sheetrock wall & the phrase ""book him"" when the corpse was unveiled...""but he was my partner..."". Please make all of Miami Vice available to purchase on video. There are a lot of die-hards out here who would purchase. Though a cable channel is now showing re-runs, I would prefer to buy clear videos, without commercials. PLEASE!!!"
5,Miami Vice episode: Best of Friends,"A complete 180 from their dramatic style. The two stars take a back seat to Iggy and Nuggy, the two that usually just provide comic relief. They`re the stars in this one and I`d would really like to view it again if anyone has a copy. It left such an impression that I even remembered the title."
5,Get them while they Last,"Flat-Screen TV is a great 4:3 aspect ratio CRT set. These will not be around much longer. The picture looks great, but the picture for this type of TV's future looks dim. LCD flat screen sets and Plasma sets are taking over the market. LCD and Plasma sets are priced out of range for the average person so I don't get the overnight transition and logic to force you to buy them. A basic Tube TV with a 4:3 aspect ratio like this Sony 34 inch set is clearly a much better choice."
4,Latvian Mittens for the experienced knitter,"This is not an expensive coffee table production that will impress with it's arty photography. This paperback impresses with the excellent research of patterns and their cultural traditions. Colour photographs give a good idea of possible colour combinations. The designs are presented in form of graphs rather than written description, which makes the following of a pattern totally easy. It is a very good and comprehensive collection of the mittens of Latvia."
5,For the pattern-lover.,"This book was a delightful surprise! It's packed to the brim with illustrations, patterns and full colour photos of different Latvian mittens. It also contains detailed and helpful techniques, with illustrations to make it even more understandable.This is the book for new knitters as well as experienced knitters, for those that like following a pattern and those who want inspiration to make their own.This is the best book of knitting patterns I've got in my shelf!(And if you're not sure; this book is in English.)"
4,A blessing in disguise,I first owned an audio cassette of this album as a teenager. It followed me through my early married life. The songs on this album have been such a blessing to me. I strongly recommend it and I will be purchasing the CD version to follow me into my mid life.
5,Love this stool,I have 2 of these stools at my work and have used them daily for over 4 years and they are comfortable and make me sit up straighterWhen I sat in a high back office chair ( much more expensive than this stool BTW) I would slump and not be as comfortable I can work in thisstool for prolonged periods and it adjusts to any heighth I need and people have tried to get the extra when I bring it to meetingsWe are going to be ordering one for the home soon My husband saw it in my office and said promptly that it worked better than the home office chairs we had so we will be ordering one for the home soon and I predict our girls will want one when they home from collegedw
2,Better photos please!,"Not enough interjections from the writers point of view. I could get past that, but... if you are going to title your book, ""photographic evidence"" at least make the photos adequate size, or maybe make a few in color. When the writer presents evidence and asks the reader to refer to a photograph, you can barely make out what you are seeing. That said, there is some interesting information in the book. Maybe not worth it though?"
3,Pretty,"Beautiful but a bit short of substance. Illustrated poem, with very good illustrations. Would be very much diminished in black and white."
4,Bilbo's Song,"It was a bit of a stretch to call this a book, but it was charming. The picture selection and arrangement seemed odd."
3,Heritage Solid Brass Shower Head,I did not receive the product because it was out of stock. It would have been nice to know that it was out of stock ahead of time so I didn't waste my and your time ordering it.
2,Buyer beware,"Product was listed as a TENA product. Item came in a box labeled Comfort Care. This product feels different, feels more slick on the back side. After using for a few weeks, some observations. When the pad gets full, the padding will wad up and slide together, giving the users a feeling of being wet. This did not happen with a true TENA pad.I for one, will NOT order from this company again. I feel that there was a swap of items and I did not receive what I ordered...the true TENA pads."
4,The dark corners of Mogwai,"This is my second purchase by Mogwai. My first was ""Come On Die Young"" which was very mellow and laid-back. ""My Father My King"" is the complete opposite. It reminds me of the scene in King Lear, when he is out in the storm naked screaming at it. It is 20 minutes of creation and destruction. It starts out very slow and simple like a usual Mogwai song does but then it gathers speed and turns into a raging storm of guitar and distortion. Something you might expect from a band like Morbid Angel but I must say as much as I don't like this type of genre, Mogwai pull it off well and even during the harsh parts, it is very beautiful and thought-provoking. It's not as great as their other stuff but it's something new and explosive. (...)"
5,"A Majestic Journey Through the Diamonds of ""Human"" Time","""My Father, My King"" is an epic (not to mention Majestic) musical experience that familiarises you with a time where time simply doesn't exist. Exceeding the 20 minute barrier by twelve seconds it simply illuminates any spirit contained in you with a sense of harmonic decadence and melodic prime casting you afar into the winds of eternity. A wonderful journey through the fine diamond kingdom of Mogwai.. But just make sure you have a dark room and an atmosphere of some kind of tranquility set up before you as this is where you can expect the greatest from this little one/one and a half track wonder. A must for anyone dedicated to passionate and genuine instrumental musical extravaganzas. I fell in love with this song and it complimented me with the same respects. Thankyou Mogwai, Thankyou Truely."
4,This is Mogwai,"As an avid listener of the band an owner of 5 of their albums, i was very much looking forward to this release...Quite simply, this a typical Mogwai song, just longer...it covers a rhealm of emotions while basically starting quiet, peaceful, and harmless then builds into just the opposite---loud, powerful, majestic---and it retains an elegant quality throughout the entire piece...For those who are familiar with Mogwai's music, i like to think of this as ""Mogwai Fear Satan"" but on a grander and more complex scale...It's an excellent piece of music and worth the minor dent it'll put in your wallet."
5,sonic fury...,"mogwai have been playing this tune based on an old hebrew hymn for a while at their live shows and its great to finally get a crisp solid recording out of it. this ep is 20 minutes of absolute beauty. the track goes from moments of soft tenderness to brutal loud chaos. by the end, the song is an inferno of sonic fury. you'll just feel like breaking something. think ""summer"", ""sine wave"", and ""christmas steps"", all rolled into one, more concentrated, and with the great steve albini pulling the strings. this is a must have ep."
