1,Don't buy this (...),This light stinks. you barely get anything out of it and it wastes your batteries.
2,Cool idea,"The idea behind the Worm Light is great. Nice to be able to drive and not have someone whining for the lights to go on so they can play their Duels. The problem that have noticed is that the battery life is severly shortened, and they were not that great to begin with. Have to keep a package of batteries in my glove compartment. Otherwise, both myself and my daughter enjoy it. She gets to ride in the car and duel, I get to drive without the risk of overhead light glare."
1,I'm not sure how this light is supposed to help.,"I bought this light in hopes that it would make my gameboy color easier to play in dim light. No such luck. I really don't understand how this light is supposed to do anything. It just adds a nice glare to the screen. The only way a light would work is if the system had a back light, or if there was an accessory to do this (highly unlikely). I would just save your money and stand near a very bright light when playing your gameboy."
4,Great Klezmer/Jazz Fusion,"If you're looking for something unique in the world of jazz, look no further than Fima Ephron's ""Soul Machine"". Blending the exotic sounds of Klezmer, the complexity of progressive rock, and the dark funk of Miles Davis' fusion period, Fima Ephron creates a sound that is easily distinguished from the pack. I also recommend this album if you're a fan of John Zorn's Masada, The Klezmatics, or Hasidic New Wave."
1,Terrible book,"I can't believe they let such a terrible illustrator release this book.The drawings are awful and the text is very basic, mostly with clich√©s.Try another drawing book."
3,Good commentary,Not to many commentary's focus on life application especially when we study the Old Testament. Holman's views won't fit every church's needs but he does an excellent job of focusing on scripture and then realting it back to our lives today. If you are leading a Bible study on Hosea I would not recommend you use this book alone. Use another commentary to fill in the gaps that this commentary will leave.
2,look for another commentary,"Bought this book to use for research paper in grad school on Micah. I sent it back, not a real commentary, looked like a bunch of Sunday School type lessons bound up together in a book. Not informative, not what I needed for research."
3,okay,it is okay because is only a biography book. the athor talk only about his daily life as an immigrant in the USA. I recommend the book for whom enjoy reading biography books.
5,Hazard returns !!,"If you remember Robert Hazard & the heroes from their heydey in the 80's you surely have alot of fond memories of their music. in his return to the music scene, RH gives us not only his ""The Seventh Lake"" CD but also his ""Blue Mountain"" CD. his sound nowadays is more of a folksy/bluesy/style, and it fits him well. you'll love songs like ""Whole lotta water"" and ""rag"" as well as the classic and touching ""Wish me luck"" on the Blue Mountain CD.buy this CD and you'll be glad you did, and then i'm betting that you'll buy his other new CD, Blue Mountain."
3,It's OK.,"The book is a collection of construction projects/articles from past issues of Fine Homebuilding magazine. There are a lot of useful details, tricks, and techniques from the best home building publication out there. But I would have preferred a more pictorial book on porches and decks to get ideas of what I wanted to build-a more ""what to build"" book instead of a ""how to build"" book. It does have useful info, just not exactly what I was looking for. Still, a good book!"
2,canadian rockies,"The DVD was very out of date, very old on the buses they now use on the ice glaciers. All of the sites were pictures from about 20 years ago. I was very disappointed with the DVD. I would have liked a newer DVD."
2,"excellent phone protection, kills reception though","Excellent , unrivaled protection to the phone while allowing easy access to everything. Text can be hard , but you just open the case and your fine. It does kill some reception . It will save your phone and you can drop it off a building . Its hardcore , but kills reception"
2,Makes tapping keys difficult,Unfortunately the case's sturdiness gets in the way to type on the Pearl. THis is particularly painful while on the go as the phone has to be removed if I need to compose an email! I am not using the case anymore - and have purchased another to ease typing.
4,If you liked Illuminatus!...,"If you enjoyed the Illuminatus! trilogy, you'll love this one.Set after the end of the events in Illuminatus (mostly) it containsmany of the characters you've grown to know and love from that book(sometimes) and many new characters (maybe) plus some that were onlyhinted at in the Illuminatus! trilogy (perhaps). Oh, and it also dealswith the Quantum Uncertainty Principle and (almost) parallel dimensions.This has been the only book that I have ever started over on immediatelyafter finishing it."
2,Marginally psychotic balderdash?,"At the risk of sounding like a literary philistine, I must say that I didn't get it. There was some really neat stuff, but it rambled on and on and I didn't catch the connections. Is this one of those works where you need to be warmed up on some good acid, or maybe a devotee of obscure occultist literature? Maybe my problem is that I've been clean and sober over ten years, or maybe because I have a Ph.D. in psychology. I don't know. I plan to read Illuminatus and see if I can make sense of that one. I think I gave it a good run for the money--I read the entire first part basically in one sitting while waiting for my wife to shop for clothes, partly in a Starbuck's coffee shop and partly on a sunny patio outside a Middle Eastern deli during an unseasonably warm day in January, in Austin, Texas. I usually make marginal notes in the books I read, and in this one all I could find, scribbled inside the front cover, was: Marginally psychotic balderdash?"
4,It's not the Illuminatus,"As far as the greatest work of the 20'th century goes, this is its sequal. Sometimes funny, sometimes deep, this book isn't the free drugs that its namesake is. In a lot of ways, it's a rehash of the old material. As an independent work goes, fine. lovely. I had three head trips and 30 minutes of afterburn from it. If it were from any author that didn't have to live up to their haunting past, it would be marvalous. But anyone who has read the original just won't be as enthralled. And anyone who hasn't read the original, should. If that doesn't bother you, Hail Eris!"
2,No Light At The End of The Tunnel,"William H Gass' The Tunnel is a huge disappointment - it's turgid, tedious and chaotic, with a surfeit of detail that's the literary equivalent of a build-up of sludge in a pipe. If you would prefer to read a more amenable and richly rewarding text by this author, try his early novel Omensetter's Luck, or the book of short fiction, In the Heart of the Heart of the Country, both of which are wonderful."
1,"please, make it stop","It's really, truly, honestly, simply, completely, utterly and unmistakenly a mess. Like something written by a near genius, in the twilight of his years, while living alone in a rat hole. It does have some fascinating language, but it amounts to diarrhea, which also, before entering a different kind of tunnel, can start out as something you thought was worthwhile. I loved his ""In the Heart of the Heart of the Country,"" but this bloat is to be avoided at all costs. Lives up to the name -- Gass."
1,"The Tunnel, by William Gass",This book is disgusting. I thought the sordid language was beyond the pale.I'm having major trouble finishing it.
1,WINDBAG- HOW DO YOU DO IT?,"Never have I read something so ostentatious and empty as this novel borne from the bowels of Gass' not-so-ponderous mind. All style, no substance. 30 years were spent in the writing of this book- 30 years wasted. The only people who actually claim to like this book are those highfalutin' Eng. Lit. students who inevitably are drawn to authors such as Gass, if only because admiring his fustian works of genius makes them feel superior to all the uncultured savages of the world (read: anyone who realizes that the only tunnel that went into the making of this book is the one leading out of (or into, as the case may be)Gass' posterior.) Recommended for those of you who are pompous enough to think the emperor has clothes, or if your sense of humour lets you see the funny in this masterwork of pretension."
4,A difficult book.,"The premise of the Tunnel is quite intriguing. It is is bookthat deceives, that doesn't even show you the truth obliquely, asEmily Dickinson put it, but instead gives you its mutilated remainsand asks you to play coroner. It is a difficult read, and requiresthat you suspend your expectations for coherence, succinctness, logicalnarrative flow, and even consistency in font and formatting.In exchange, you get plugged into the raw static of a tortured mind.Is it innovative? Definitely. Is it successful? Sometimes."
2,A lot of sex and no commitment,I made a mistake buying this and I'm selling it used.The story wasn't romantic much and too much loose sex!
5,"FAMILY, LOVE & LUST INTERTWINED IN FAST PLOT",EXCELLENT READ! This new author has the ability to capture the reader's attention and keep it! A unique cast of characters and a dramatic plot. When will the sequel be available!!
2,Poor recording quality,"As a huge Waylon Jennings and Jessi Colter fan I was excited to get this CD, since there are four recordings I did not have. This is a budget-line CD and I did know that when I purchased it, But ""Never Can Tell"" is a duet where Waylon (if it really is him) sounds incredibly out of his range (very high, so high I do doubt that it's him...that said who else would she be duetting with?) They are not all duets either. Most sound like 'throw-away' tracks, meaning there is a reason they were not included on regular albums. There is such a small amount of Jessi's material out there that I would recommend it for the hard-core Jessi fan but start with her Greatest Hits and the ""Wanted..Outlaws"" album first. I does include the ""Storms Never Last"" duet. She is scheduled to release a new album Feb. 28, 2006. (!!!!)"
4,"Waylon & Jessie,All American Country","Great reissue of one of the best selling country albums of all time,sound is good and ofcause the music is great, Waylon & Jessie at their bestif you like Waylon you need this in your collection."
1,try a newer book,i didn't like this book nearly as much as some of mallory's other books - i found the whole thing ridiculous and the 'hero' not much of a hero. i would recomend trying some of mallory's newer books over this one.
5,Edge of Seat Story,Once I started reading this story of intrigue and romance it was impossible to put itdown until I finished. The author did a wonderful job portraying the characters and thedanger which is around every curve.
5,Amazon Best Price on Weber Gold B Stainless Steel,"This grill is fabulous. First, let me say the pricing for this particular grill on Amazon is the best. Trust me, I've looked around.The grill is easy to use, easy to clean, looks great. The flavorizer bars make cooking so much easier - no flare ups - so no burned food. The drip pan is easy to replace, the stainless steel grates are so easy to clean.The only thing I wish this grill had are doors like the very high priced Summit model."
5,No More Flamethrowers for Me,"After replacing all the previous flamethrowers I've owned, I finally broke down and bought the Genesis Gold B. What a difference, no flare up's and grill heats up to 700 degrees in minutes. If your serious about grilling, don't waste your money on cheap grills, buy a Weber and be done with it."
2,All New???,"I bought this book thinking I would finally learn some new techniques, such as how get a 3-D effect using one-stroke. But like most of Donna's books, there is a lot of repeated material, so ""all new"" is misleading. The only ""new"" part of the book is a few projects that you can do -- once you buy the new Plaid products required! So, there's very little to learn from in this book. And, one problem I have with Donna: her step-by-step directions on how to do things often do not lead to the finished product displayed. I'm wondering if there's anyone out there who can provide some better one-stroke instruction."
5,So Simple & So Easy!,"As always, Donna Dewberry offers clear instructions with many illustrations, making it very easy to duplicate her strokes. The book contains quite a variety of items and is a wonderful to my Dewberry paint library!"
4,too polished,"While this album captures the crystalline voice of Alison and the incredible playing of her bandmates, it doesn't really catch fire. I was hoping for a bit more spontaneity and improvisation - the numbers are all short and just when you want them to take off for another round they shut it down. Its a small complaint for such excellent music but really this ""double"" CD doesn't differ that much from a studio album except for the crowd noise."
4,Superb Live Performance,"As a general rule, I don't care for recordings of live performances as much as studio recordings. This is usually because the crowd noise interferes with my enjoyment of the music. That is not the case here. In fact, it is one of the best live performances I have ever heard recorded.I was also not too familiar with Alison Kraus and Union Station beyond being names I have heard. This was my first recording of theirs. It was wonderful.Some of the music is old fashioned bluegrass and some is more in the country line of things. Both are done with superb skill in terms of singing and instrumentals. In fact, the band seems to be one of the most competent group of professional musicians working together today. Each comes to the fore at various times and each does a wonderful job."
3,"Nice, not super","Except for ""The Boy Who Wouldn't Hoe Corn"", I wouldn't even listen to the second CD. Also suffers from poor audio when Ms. Krause is talking to the audience. Poor engineering levels on my CD. But then, I didn't buy this to hear her talk. I'm just saying........"
3,needs a new sound mix,The music on this album is first rate and would have been enjoyable if the unruly audience had not been so loud and allowed to overwhelm the sounds being created on stage. Stick with the remarkable studio recordings!
5,Great CD,This Alison Krauss & Union Station CD is really very good. The song selection was pleasing and gave attention to each performer of the group.I'm glad I purchased it and would highly recommend it. It enhances my blue-grass collection.
5,Alison Krauss rocks,If you dig progressive country this album has the best slide dobro I've ever heard. The backup band is totally hot and is as much a reason to buy this album as is Alison Krauss.
5,Great CD! But doesn't do justice to the live show.....,"This is a must have, however, it doesn't compare the true feeling of the live show. I just saw them live a week before I received the CD. While musically this is a great piece, it doesn't capture how engaging the band is live. They had the crowd laughing as much as clapping.I'll be listening to this for years in my car, but can't wait for the DVD for the house."
5,awesome album/CD,"One of my new favorites. Hadn't listened much to AKUS in the past, but this album has it all. What a voice; what a band!"
4,Outstanding,"This is so funny,I've downloaded a bunch of the cuts on this CD from the internet over the last couple of years and always though they were bootlegged because of the audience ""participation"".Now, when I play the CD I realize it was produced that way on purpose.I love the entire CD from beginning to end and would have given it a five but for the bad decision to include all the extraneous sound."
5,First Time Listener -- thrilled to discover this band!,"I bought this CD after watching a part of the live show on PBS -- Alison's silky smooth vocals appealed instantly to me. Listening to the CD was something else -- it is very well recorded for a live show and all the musicians are masters of their trade. The first song ""Let me touch you.."" alone is worth the price of the CD! For you audiophile listeners -- this album is recorded in DSD and has an amazing soundstage and depth. I have always loved acoustic bass and this album truly brings out how much difference it can make to the overall music. I wonder why more bands don't prefer the acoustic bass.Anyway, this album is a treasure. I am sure that like myself, this should appeal to a wide cross over audience who listen to jazz, classical, blues.In this age where Brittany Spears & Justin Timberlake are considered to be musicians, it is so hard to find good music. Thanks to Alison Krauss and the Union Station for giving us something so special."
3,Representative of what Alison Krauss does in live performances,"I absolutely love Alison Krauss's bluegrass music. Unfortunately a lot of her music these days is not really bluegrass, but rather falls into an acoustic country ballad category. So this album and most of her recent albums are hit & miss for me. If you love her ballads, you'll love this. If you like the bluegrass - then you'll love those specific cuts, but wish there were more of them. This is a live concert CD, so expect to hear the crowd. Great performance on all the cuts by top notch musicians."
5,A must for your collection!,Even if you aren't a fan of bluegrass - you will enjoy this CD set. The voice of Alison is absolutely angelic and pure. The musicians are superb and their enjoyment of playing music comes through. This is almost as good as seeing them live!
4,Beautiful !,"Allison Krauss ? The voice of an angel is right here!A fantastic performance but I agree with other reviewers that the best bet for a new AKUS listener is the ""Now that I've Found You"" CD.As for this Live performance - top notch vocals all around as well as talented musicians.I loved the crowd interaction."
5,It doesn't get any better than this,"What an album! The musicianship brings tears to your eyes -- there are no better musicians to be found anywere in any genre! This is due, in large part, to the quality of the recording which allows you to really hear each instrument and appreciate how well they are being played. Other reviews here speak to the songs themselves but suffice it to say that they are wide-ranging in their styles and influences. Enjoy!!p.s. -- this is a good price, too.Even a year later it's still my favorite album! It just keeps getting better!"
4,A Country/Bluegrass Musical Delight,"The 2004 Grammy winner for best Bluegrass CD is a great introduction to the music of Alison Krauss & Union Station. Ms Krauss has one of the most beautifaul voices in music today, making good songs great & great songs wonderful.My favorite song here is a cover of the Foundations classic Baby, Now That I've Found You. Let Me Touch You For Awhile, The Lucky One, Take Me For Longing & When You Say Nothing At All round out a top notch CD. Contributions by Union Station (Dan Tyminski on Bright Sunny South, Ron Block on Faraway Land) & instrumentals (Choctaw Hayride & Cluck Old Hen) only make this collection better.Recommended for country/bluegrass fans."
5,One of the best EVER!,"This album (a collection of songs that AKUS has recorded over the years at a live concert) is easily one of my top 5 favorite albums of all time. I'm not a fan of honky-tonk country, but I found a love of bluegrass and the amazing insturmentation that goes with it when I first started listening to this group. From the first song they had me hooked. What amazes me most is that this entire album was recorded live, which just goes to show how talented they all are. The bits of audience reaction that are included do not get in the way of flow of the songs, but actually add to excitement of the songs. I loved it so much that I bought the DVD of the concert as well (also great with some documentaries). If you have other albums by AKUS or Alison Kraus, this is a must have! It has the very best of AKUS from the last 15 years."
4,Don't miss This CD,I haven't heard much of Alison Krauss before but this CD gave me the impuls tolook for more CDs to enjoy listening to. She is worth it! Believe me!
5,adeeb's alison krauss review,I ordered this CD set after having heard it on a friends iPod. It was as a result of that introduction Alison Krauss' music that I've started investing in her other CDs that she has out. This set is one of the better live performances I've heard from anyone.
5,The best CD set ever of all time!,"i have to disagree with the reviewer who did not like the crowd noise. i think it adds tremendously to the excitement of this live set. When the crowd breaks out in a cheer - it makes me smile and get even more pumped for this outrageously GREAT double-disc set. The performances are absolutely flawless and stay solid true to the original recordings. What a fantastic blend of New Favorite tunes, older classics and O Brother Where Art Thou - all rolled into one dynamite set. Thank you so very much Alison, Dan and the boys. Can't praise it enough. Recommend it HIGHLY."
5,La Femme Nikita,"I love Nikita and Michael. I was so depressed when the show ended, I cried many tears and felt like I was losing some really special people. Great show."
3,Season 5 rushed through,"(sorry for my poor English)I think that the publishers rushed through season 5 to get it finished.First of all (and what a BIG shame!) is that they didn't put English subtitles on the DVD's. Especially for non-English speaking people (like me), it's sometimes hard to follow what everybody is saying, like in Operation's briefings etc. I hope that the publishers will consider this and will bring out a new version with the English subtitles.Second, the packing isn't as nice as with the previous seasons. A cheap box, no booklet but only a few sheets inside the DVD holder etc.Well, I didn't watch this season yet, but I hope the content will compensate above!"
1,no English sub titles,"It would appear that the series producers have noe grabbed the cash and run.All the previous sets had subtitles so we could assume the last very rushed set would also-NO.why take the trouble to botjher abouit customers ,just treat them with contempt.Ignore that they have stuggled these years with Micj=haels fractured mumbles English,we had the subsNow they have the cash and have left us with a very nasty tasteOne day if they fall over the word concience and find out its meaning then they might reissue thislast series with English Subtitles,but we will not hold our breathSahme on youPRINCE RAFAE"
3,La Femme Nikita - The Final Chapter,"After following the lives of the characters, Michael and Nikita for the first 4 Series, I was a little disappointed in how the writers put an end to their relationship. However, reading between the lines, they gave you the glimpse of hope that they would reunite once again. Its a pity the series ended there."
5,Great Ending,I like the fact that this show ended with a question. It will always leave it open as to what really happens. Doesn't give a clear cut answer and also leaves the door for future possibilities
5,I miss Nikita,"My girlfriend got me into la Femme Nikita last year when someone gave her the 1st Season on DVD...we watched it together, rented the next few seasons on Netflix, and at the end of the 4th season (which was supposedly to be the last) there were just so many questions left unanswered and a general bummed out feeling for the audience.My girlfriend and I have argued that it would have been better to end it with the 4th season, what with the nature of the show, but this last season definitely didn't disappoint. (I just wish there were more!)"
5,LFN,Great DVD set in good condition. Received quickly! Thanks! (I miss this series! A hundred times better than the knock-off Alias)
1,"This book is horrible, lots of better ones available $","This book is cheaply constructed and falls apart right away. It is under 30 pages. If you want to play blackjack without counting cards, but any of the popular blackjack books, whether they involve card counting or not. I bought a bunch of them and all of them have a section at the begin on the basic strategy, which is what you are probably looking for anyways. They are better written and cost just a few dollars more. This book is worth ... tops. Buy something else, I regret buying this book."
3,Not the best..but...,"Any recording of the Preservation Hall Jazz Band deserves notice. However, the funky, dark qualities of Preservation Hall were destroyed by video lighting. Inconsistant editing and intrusive interviews...(let them play, guys! It's all we need to know!) spoiled what is otherwise a musically satisfying performance..."
2,disappointing,"Two things get in the way of enjoying this DVD. First, and most annoying, is the trombonist who gets his face in front of other musicians to the point of distraction. And he is not very good. The second is that not all the numbers listed on the box are on the DVD. The most memorable is ""Just a Closer Walk With Thee"" which was my reason for buying the DVD - not there.An added comment is that the inane interviews get in the way of the music."
3,A bright smile,"It has a bright and cheerful color and design and is as smily as it appears in the picture!But the quality is not great (I was expecting something of better quality for $13.5,But it's OK).Mine has two little scratches inside.The other point that makes me to give it 3 out 5 is that It's a bit smallerthan the mugs I used to have."
3,had a crack when first time used,"I got this for my roommate and the first time she poured in hot water, a small long crack showed in the inside of the cup. In part it was her fault but still, could be better."
3,Not bad,"Maybe I expected more of this book. Its good, but it feels like Andrew McLean tried to say too much in too short of time, so he tells you a little bit about a lot but leaves you with questions."
4,Very enlightening,"I found this book very enlightening to read.Too many horse training books are full of vague, almost mystical phrases about the attitude of the horse. This one brings it back to scientific behavioural principles which you can understand and apply.It explains learning theory (operant and classical conditioning) and then how it applies to training a young horse or correcting problems in an older horse. It has great step by step pictures to illustrate the points he makes. If you've ever been mystified about how a horse learns to do what you expect of it, you'll love this book."
4,"well researched, not for everyone","I can't say I agree (or necessarily disagree) with everything in this book, but it gave me a lot to think about. McLean certainly knows his horses. This is not a book for those who like to anthropomorphize or romanticize horses."
3,Interesting workable concepts,I found McLeans approach to training in concert with behavioral psychology and very helpful in understanding the methods that facilitate learning. It is not a layman's book. It is probably best understood by individuals familiar with cognitive processing and behaviorist theories who are equestrians of all skill levels.
5,"An Amazing band, amazing album","I first heard this band on a plane to Frisco, then live 2 nights later. I was blown away. The incredible precise arrangments on both albums are excuted perfectly live. It was another 6 months waiting in jersey till i laid my hands on DECLINE OF DAY. It stayed in the CD player for 2 weeks. Every song is a hit. This band is one of the few bands i know of that is making truly original music. Buy this disc, and their first disc, and you will be in for a non-stop ride."
1,Worst manual pump!,"I bought this manual pump w/o doing any research on it and what a terrible mistake! Compare to the Medela Harmony & Avent ISIS I got later, it is a absolute joke - I couldn't get a drop of breast milk out and it hurts like crazy.If you need a manual pump, do yourself a favor and avoid this one. You cannot go wrong w/ either the Medela or Avent one though (Medela Harmony slightly better IMO since it is BPA-free)."
2,Boring Book,"I just did not get the message this book was trying to convey. I struggled to get thru it and I rarely found an exciting page that would normally encourage me to continue reading. I wasted money on this book because it was highly rated. I often thought of a comment that a good friend of mine said, he said; "" I don't care how much a book cost me, if it doesn't keep me engaged, I throw it in the trash."" I thought of that comment on just about every page while reading this book. Sorry, but I must be honest."
2,Not enough practical business travel information,"As a frequent visitor to the Silicon Valley area, I find difficulty with the fact that there are still no books directed towards business travelers. This area is NOT a tourist spot, so I found this book, while historically interesting, not particularly helpful for my requirements. Practical advice like, ""good luck finding a room during the week"" was not included."
4,"Nice tarp, with some drawbacks","I just got this tarp. It's well made, and looks like it will do the job I need it to do. But, beware of one drawback: the water-repelling treatment on the fabric smells awful. I'm actually afraid to cover what I meant to cover with this for fear of the thing acquiring this tarp odor. I'm trying to air out the tarp before I use it. If that doesn't work, I'll end up washing it, which will make it lose its water-repelling nature, but also, hopefully, the bad smell."
4,Good investment,"The set up instructions for the bike are clear and concise, the screws and nuts are packaged wonderfully as indivudual units on a piece of cardboard and referenced to each portion of the set up. Some of the BEST assembly instructions I have ever used. I would recommend having an assistant for some of the later portions of assembly, as the pieces can get quite combersome and heavy, and there is the potential of damaging the computer wires.The bike is sturdy and has excellent construction. The computer monitors heart rate, tracks mileage, speed and estimates calories burned.For those of you cupholder junkies, this bike has THREE water bottle holders.I like it. Let's see if it stands the test of time. It is a Schwinn, so, I am quite sure it will."
4,bike review,Delivery was expeditious and product arrived in excellent condition. My nephew who assembled the bike stated the directions therfor were clear concise and relatively easy. My only comment relates to my inability to view television while riding bike since the front portion blocks the viewing area. I plan to elevate the television on the existing cabinet by placing a solid stand on the top thereof and solve the problem thereby-----assuming one of my strong nephews will do the lifting. I am 78 years old vice under 13.
1,Hasn't worked properly since I bought it,I've been getting an error message on the screen which makes the bike unusable pretty much since the day I bought it. I've replaced nearly every electrical part on the bike at the behest of the maker and it still doesn't work. The maker will only send out a technician if I pay the $125/hour to fix it.
4,"Solid bike, great price, poor box","I purchased this bike so I could get back into cardio shape. I am 6'7"", 230lbs. and needed a unit that would hold up over the long term. After much research, I decided to purchase the 212. The box took a beating during shipping from the heavy parts contained within. UPS was not to blame, the box just isn't designed for cross country trips. A few parts were broken during transit. However, after a quick call to Schwinn's USA based customer service dept., I had the replacement parts in 2 business days free of charge for shipping. They must know about their box's faults and just replace the broken parts without question. The magnetic resistance is smooth and the programs are engaging. I am very plesed with my purchase. Took one star off for the shipping problem."
2,Same old Schwinnn quality.,"I gave the benefit of the doubt and thought perhaps, with a number of positive reviews, that the poor quality Schwinn was a thing of childhood jokes. I went ahead and purchased this in October of 2007. I am fairly active in other respects, so perhaps used my Schwinn an average of 2 times per week over the 2 year period (which works out to approximately 200 times). The bike was fairly decent to begin with. After about a year there was a discernible noise as my right foot pushed forward, but that was nothing a little more volume on the TV couldn't fix. Then tonight, to my dismay, my left pedal snapped right off where it connects to the 'wheel' section. I give it 2 stars generously. But this machine certainly didn't help quash my previously held notion about Schwinn quality."
2,No instruction manual,My bike did not come with an instruction manual. This seems to be a recurring problem with this company.
3,Needs repair but still works,Got this and installed in place of one of the swings - since was going in place of a swing was way easy to set up- just slip the metal ring over the swing hook. However - used less than a month and the rope on the top from metal ring began to fray and break. (only used by kids weighing 110 # or less) Replacing the rope (with chain) and should work fine ( have not had chance to test yet) all the other ropes seem in good condition - no fraying (yet)Comfy chair and good deal if you replace/reinforce the top rope right away
1,Beware!! Dangerous and poorly constructed,"Ordered this chair to replace one that had served us well for years. The construction of this chair was not as nice, but rated as able to handle up to 250 lbs. On the first day, my 125 lb son sat in it and the ropes holding it to the frame broke suddenly, dropping him to the concrete below. Luckily, only bruises. Dangerous - do not buy!!!"
1,Swing Almost broke child's butt bone!,We had purchased this swing to hang from a large tree in our back yard. We had the swing for about 2-3 months and the rope shredded and broke while a 7 year girl was on the swing. This is definely not a product I would ever recommend purchasing as it is very poor quality.
1,junk,"The swing came apart when in use!!!!!! wont hold my 206 pounds. dont buy JUNK JUNK JUNK!!!!!!!!The seller wont exchange or refund us dont buy junk junk junk!!!!!!!!!!!i sent seller a e-mail about this problem they said this item does not have ropes on it ! What do think is holding up the seat""ropes""!!!!! The whole seat is supported by ""ropes "" not a seller i will EVER buy from again !!!!!!! YOU should not buy this product it is DANGEROUS!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Texsport handling of shipping a disappointment,"I ordered this texsport daydreamer chair. When I received it there was no tape on bottom of box. The instructions for mounting and hardware were not in the box. All I have is the swing! The box didn't look like UPS had torn the box, it looked like there was never tape on there to begin with. Shipping it back would be about the same price as buying the hardware."
2,Brings nothing new to the table,"Probably a very good resource for individuals beginning their research in thyroid problems, a trustworthy source, but this book provided no new information and did not address the problem of continued fatigue, immune deficiency, etc. that comes along with hypothyroid despite the fact that numbers are okay."
2,Bad quality,"I was disappointed by these hampers. They are a good size for the nursery, but they are of poor quality. The bottoms are frayed and there is a large gap on the side of both baskets where the weave has bunched. I'm not sure how long these will last."
4,Nice set at a good price.,Redoing my kitchen...was looking for a nice wicker waste basket. Found this set and really like it. I wish the smaller basket was a little larger but I plan to use it for my kitchen waste basket. The larger one is being used as a hamper in my daughters bathroom & works great. Good value for the price & construction.
3,"Badger Basket Two Hamper Set w/Liners, Natural",Not exactly what I thought one hamper is quite a bit smaller and material not as sturdy as I had hoped But for the price seems to be doing the job
2,Very different sizes,"The photo makes the baskets look roughly the same size, but they are infact VERY different. I thought we could use them for colors and whites, but the smaller basket is far too small to hold clothes unless you want to for laundry every day. We now use it as a large waste basket (thought really it's TOO large for that.)"
3,"Pleasant pieces except for the Albeniz ""Iberia"" part.","The three tracks from ""Iberia"" sounded like a bunch of noise to me. The other twelve tracks were pleasant guitar pieces."
4,AP World History Review: Children of the Sun Book Review,"The book Children of the Sun by Alfred Crosby explains the use of energy throughout time. It uses interesting stories and facts in the book to tell about the different energies that were used. Crosby includes basic knowledge of energy, for those who are not familiar with it. This knowledge is paired with more scientific information, but the information is presented in an understandable way. Not only is the information understandable, but the book is written in a way that is easy to read.The author of this book tries to make a point on humankind's thirst for energy. I believe he was successful in his attempt. Crosby shows how people only wanted more energy as time went on, and how we continue to feed off of energy today. Not only does this book provide wonderful historical information, but it also makes a comment on how dependent we are on energy."
3,OK but not great,I was a bit disappointed with this product. It leaves a slight after-taste and doesn't have the great flavor that was advertised and promised.
3,Mr. A's Review,"I have not heard Laredo's Etudes Tableaux, but Mr. A's blanket comment that a number of other 'classic' versions of this wonderful music are ""boring"" and lack technique must not go unchallenged. Where, I must wonder, do Mr. A's sensibilities lie? I have the Fergus-Thompson, Hobson and Shelley versions of this music and I find Mr Shelley's performance by far the best of the lot. To suggest that *his* technique needs work is both pompous and patently absurd. And to find Shelley's fiery playing ""boring"" suggests a profound level of ennui in the listener."
5,so unique,"so unique & beautiful, and, boy, does it mash the potatoes !!!! I love it. worth the $$$$ and wait :-))"
2,Just OK,"I bought this CD at a Donnas concert, because the Campfire Girls were one of their opening acts, along with the band Your Enemies' Friends. Anyway, most of the tracks on Delongpre sound the same and get kind of repetitive after a while. A large majority of these songs are (or at least try to be) angst-ridden. The Campfire Girls most definitely sound better live."
4,cool cooking,"We use this almost every day. If we are cooking meat, patotes almost everything we use this instead of the oven. Saves on power and heating your house up. You can put a frozen piece of meat right in and cook it. Love it, in fact this is the second one we have gotten. We have been using the Jet Stream for about 15 years. The only thing that I wish they would change is the drip pan, they could make it glass or something that the finish doesn't chip off. Other wise we love this."
1,Buyer Beware!,"CAVEAT EMPTOR. While my jet stream oven was great while it lasted, the motor or ""control arm"" for it BROKE less than a month after the 1 yr. warranty expired-- and this with only very moderate use during that year, maybe 3 or 4 times a week. When I called Nesco, I was told that one year's life expectancy was about ""normal"" for small appliances, which basically meant that they don't expect their product to outlast the warranty. There was nothing I could do short of buying an entirely new oven (you can't buy a replacement ""control arm""). How many of us would willingly spend $130 for an appliance whose manufacturer thinks this way? My GE microwave had a 1 yr warranty, too, but it's been working over 10 years without incident. I would advise all those who are willing to spend $130 on a disposable item to go ahead. Everyone else should wait until they offer an extended warranty."
4,Millie's Grand Adventure Book 6,"I was really glad to be able to get this book, since I was told it was out of print. As with all of Martha Finley's work, I was not disappointed. Sure wish they still wrote wholesome story books like that these days."
5,Tour de Roxy,"Roxy's comeback was a triumph - even given the lack of new material, given the great musicianship, the energy to put on a fantastical show, and the cool vibes all around. This disc is from the same tour of the DVD, but the songs are not taken from the same performances and there are songs not on the DVD. A must have for Roxy fans and amongst the very best live albums ever made."
3,A Great Live Group,"This is one group with so many live performances. That is because perhaps more than anything else they were a hard working band, not just a studio group. Viva is probably one of my favourite of their live albums. One thing about the Live album format you can only get whats there its so much different that the studio unless you're a lip syncing band. They certainly aren't. In my opinion they have had better performances."
3,Roxy's Return,"A good live album if you're into these kind of things, but hardly essential. It makes for a nice souvenier much in the same way PULSE made for Pink Floyd's final tour. The differences between this live album and the studio recordings are noticable.Bryan Ferry takes the songs down a few keys and the tempos are quite different, usually faster than the albums especially on ""Oh Yeah"" and ""Love Is The Drug"" (Hey Bryan, you needed to run to the bathroom that bad?). At least it's closer to what we would have expected from them since the far overproduced live collection from the early years. The solos are moderately interesting, and Ferry's voice is fine but nothing amazing. Good quality recording , better than the mess of recent bootlegs floating around like ""Concerto""."
5,The Best Program Ever!,"There is nothing that you cannot do with this program when it comes to any home or office items such as flyers, posters, business cards, invitations, Logos,etc. And it is so easy to use! Dont pay $100.00 for the newer versions! This is all you need!"
1,print shop,No progress with this product sent back once I just kept the second copy neither worked on my system.
2,Not impressed,"Don't be fooled by the box saying how many they've sold anyone who knows anything about software knows you cannot return an opened software box so sold means nothing.This software in unimpressive, I bought it because I needed to do my wedding invitation and I liked the description thinking I could use it for may other things as well.Well I ended up using WORD for my invitations, yes WORD, why because word actually did everything I wanted that this program said it would do but didn't! I spent HOURS trying to use it's ""simple"" templates to no avail they would not print correctly or in the size they claimed to be. In the end I am out the money I spent and pretty mad about it."
2,Print Shop Pro Publisher 22 Deluxe,"I've had earlier versions of Print Shop before and was looking forward to this version as it said it was Vista compatible. Unfortunately it did not work with Vista, even with the recommended patch. If you have Vista, wait until they get the bugs worked out."
1,Shame on Amazon,I purchased this item from Amazon. The disc had scratches and was unable to either use it or get my money back. These items can not be returned.
2,Has Big Problems!,"I have had various editions of PrintShop since they first started out. This one has the same problems as my last versions (Printshop 20), but it is becoming even worse! A prime example is a simple blank sign project I have been trying to work on, off and on all day, but am getting nowhere as it keeps shutting down due to problems. Sometimes it says that it is doing an illegal action (just trying to change the font type). The last time, it just stalled out, was not responding, and had to close. Each time I have to reopen it, I have to wait forever for it to come up. This thing has HUGE problems.The Print Shop 22 Deluxe [OLD VERSION]"
1,Keep The Logo Creator... Nix the Print Shop.,"When I bought this product I thought it was going to do some really good graphic design things much like Adobe Photoshop or Illustrator(but for a much cheaper price of course). I loved the Logo Creator and I still use it today for my business; however, the Print Shop Pro is not professional at all. As a matter of fact, you can't even make photos or images opaque! I wanted to create a specific sized invitation and I had the hardest time trying to change the margins. Also, if your printer doesn't accept full-bleed printing, you will not be able to change the margins to make it full-bleed and have a professional printing company print it. Overall, keep the Logo Creator if you need to and nix the Print Shop. Make an ornament out of the CD or something..but don't use it for any good quality print media."
1,dissapointed,I bought this book as required for my organic synthesis course. I am dissapointed with how little detail is given for each mechanism. Also the examples given are also very difficult to work out and no solution is given for each example.
3,Beaten by strategic applications,"When I wrote an editorial review for Mundy's book I really thought it was the best one on the market. At about the same time ""Strategic Applications of named reactions in organic synthesis"" by Kurti and Czako (forward by Corey and Intro by Nicolaou) came out, and that book is AWESOME. Go check it out. We even use it as a text book in upper division organic synthesis courses."
3,Discontinued AND Hi-way Robbery Abounds,"These are good, in their hey-day they were four bucks for 30. Even less in their double refill bonus packs! They are not worth these outrageous prices because they are discontinued. Find a replacement, you'll need to sooner or later. I've moved back to buff-puffs,Aveeno Clear Complexion Cleansing Bar, 3.5-Ounce (Pack of 2)"
1,Fake,"The book is presented as a long colaboration between model & photographer.This is just a lie, what we see here is just 2 or 3 photo sessions, taken from the same period: some very cheap and uninteresting shots, very boring in fact.At least, the pictures are color shots turns into B&W;, and the job is terribly done (and so is the printing of the book)If you're interested in young woman sexuality(i mean discovering their sexuality) i suggest you keep an eye on Natasha Merrit's work, far more interesting, or even on the Suicidegirls publication.Pardon my bad english."
2,"Layley,A Major Disappointment","Where to begin? The poses for the most part are unimaginative and repetitive, the models expression fixed and emotionless. Lighting is primarily frontal flash yielding a washed out effect,low contrast, and shadow. This, together with the small picture size (some are a quarter of the 5 by 7 page) make it difficult see what detail there is to interest the viewer. With rare exception the photograper appears unwilling to get close to his subject which gives his pictures a distant quality and reduces the model to a stick figure on a small page. Amateurish at best. The rave reviews seen above are highly suspect to me. Save your money and skip this boring piece."
4,One of my favorite scents,"I have been using this scent, along with 2 others, for years and have received many compliments on it. It comes in different strengths. I usually get the 100 or 200 strength. Anything less seems to die out early in the day."
5,Ciara best perfume,Ciara is the best perfume with staying power to boot. I would suggest this product for anyone of any age. It has smelled good on everyone that I know that owns a bottle. I will continue to purchase it!
1,Is this fake Cologne?,"My wife has been wearing this fragrance for 2 decades. The bottle we got from Amazon doesn't even come close to smelling like the one she is accustomed to. We detect fake Ciara. The downside is, we cannot return it either as Amazon doesn't accept returns on perfumes. Don't take the risk, buy from a physical store. This certainly is NOT Ciara. It stinks!"
2,ciara,"I love ciara. i have used it for years. I put it on and i cannot smell it again, but i get so many people saying how good it smells on me. I was very disapointed with this product. it does not smell. is it that old or not the real thing? i know that i only paid the shipping because i had a gift card but i thought that i would get people saying how good it smelled, but i have gotten no one to say anything about my cologne. please email me and let me know the answer. thanks lindaadams_60@yahoo.com"
1,This Ciara being offered is stale and no longer smells like the real thing,The bottle of Ciara I received is nothing like other bottles of Ciara I have purchased. This smelled like rubbing alcohol and is obviously way past the expiration date.I love real Ciara cologne ..... but this is not it.
3,ok,I understand this was a hit for Hrithik and so decided to buy it. I guess it was ok but was not fully convinced. I actually liked Mujse dosti karoge better for an earlier film of his.
1,I lasted 15 minutes.,Good grief! I love Bollywood movies but this was painful to watch. I thought the story line would be decent but not even that could save this movie.
2,debacle,"I don't even know where to begin on this one. I love Hindi films, and I own many, but this one is just ridiculous. Way over the top. Every scene seems contrived, and there's so much poor acting. Clearly there's no accounting for differences, so try it if you must, but don't say I didn't warn you."
2,It's a book for dummies!,"This book should be titled, ""Contractor's Exam for Dummies""! The author wastes a lot of resources on teaching you how to use the calculator, and do simple math.It states that it is a generic contractor's exam book, but it is farthest from the truth. The authors are all Floridaians; hence, everything they write is around Florida and its exams.Very disappointed in this book - waste of money - unless you are looking for a Florida examination help."
4,"Skip the first CD,second is much much better","Althought official story said that Aretha Franklin suddenly blossomed when she left ""Columbia"",I love her early recordings.The voice was always there,piano playing was always there,its just influence of her then-husband-manager that drowns down a bit the whole picture,as he clearly had ambition to make his wife a night club ballad singer.For that reason I usualy skip the first CD on this collection,which is overproduced and Aretha doesn't sound comfortable on standards,but I prefer second CD which shows her rhytm & blues potential.It shows that her work for ""Atlantic"" was just a natural progression,there would never be ""Respect"" if she did not already have ""Wont Be Long"" or ""Soulville"" or ""Lee Cross""."
5,Greatest jazz & blues combo from the Queen of Soul!!,"I have had this albumn for several years now. I can always find something that fits. From the uptempo Love for Sale, This Could be the Start of Something, and Won't Be Long to the heartfelt pain of love lost in Today I Sing the Blues and Every Little Bit Hurts, this albumn has it all. It soothes the ache and excites the soul. Muddy Water tells that ""before I see you go from woman to woman, I'd rather drink muddy water, sleep out in a hollow log."" My favorite remains Trouble in Mind (""Yes I'm blue, but I won't be blue always. Sun is gonna shine, in my back door some day.) This lady sings the blues. The Queen sings the classics Misty, Unforgettable, God Bless the Child, and Mockingbird. In All Night Long she speaks of the man of her dreams. Or if you're in a party mood, follow her to Soulville for a old-time block party including food, folks, and fun. If you like jazz and blues...If you love Aretha... hear her like you never heard her before."
5,Aretha Franklin - The Great Voice of Soul,"It's funny. Columbia has released what seems like dozens of Aretha compilations and they have never included two of my favorites. Franklin's cover of K. C. vocalist, Pricilla Bowman's (Keep Your) ""Hands Off"" and Aretha's own composition, ""Little Miss Raggedy Ann,"" which was the B-side of ""Can't You Just See Me."" I was surpised not to see ""That Lucky Old Sun,"" which is probably the BEST recording on that song ever made."
4,Get the 2 Disc Edition.,"The movie, was violent, disconnected.....but it was a reflection of the Drug Culture.Turns out the guy was a study in Contrast.Disc 2 put it all together , for me."
1,One to think about,"I wasn't impressed with this shoe, first I ordered a size 9 it was soooo small I am still convinced it was a size 6 ( so if you order I suggest you inquire about size). And secondly, I wear a lot of platform shoes and as far as I am concerned this is one of the heavier ones. I truly liked it better on the website."
3,honky tonk oops,"well, unfortunatley who ever packed my game, they forgot to pack the CD that comes with it. i had six friends over, dressed to the nines in cowboy western gear, and we had no direction. so we improvised.the game itself was fun. just check before you have your party that you got your cd. it was a real buzz kill."
4,Needed for now obsolete tools,"B&D sold lots of handy, battery-powered screwdrivers, flashlights, etc. which use this little battery; so if you own one, you will need this. It's slightly better than the regular one. B&D now sells tools using a battery which you cannot remove; so the tool become worthless when you can no longer charge the battery. B&D finds this strategy more useful to its bottom line, but not its reputation for quality."
5,NiMH doubles the power of B&D hand vac,New NiMH batteries doubled the power of my old. B&D hand vac. Well worth the pricy cost!
5,B&D Gold Battery,"The shipment was so speedy and the battery pack was perfect. We had not thought we could get a replacement battery so the order was a wonderful happening, and our dustbuster has received a new life!Thank you."
4,Black & Decker VP110 VersaPak,These batteries are used in a portable vacum made by Black & Decker and work very well.
4,Love These Units,I have been a Versapack tool owner for years and love the lightweight and versatility of the tools. The Gold batteries can't be beat in this application. I looked locally for a supply of new ones and found Batteries Plus the only store that had them but for $29 each plus tax! Amazon order worked out fine for about half the cost and I beat the state out of their cut!
5,my return,Ended up that the battery was not the problem with our drill. I think we need a new charger instead. That is why the batteries were returned.Thanks
2,Does hold charge very well,This Pack does not hold a charge very long whether it gets used or not. Probably better product out there.
5,"Old technology, but reliable","I have been using the Versa-pak powered tools for years, and though they are underpowered by todays's standards, they still do the job. These packs are expensive, but they are well made and long lasting, and if you want to continue to use the B&D tools, you have to have them. I recommend the gold over the standard, they give you a longer time between charges."
5,Good As Gold,My VersaPak Gold battery arrived fully charged and hasn't lost a milli-amp after driving dozens of screws without being re-charged. It is superior to the nicad battery it replaced and upgrading to NiMH is worth the higher price. I also liked not having to pay for another charger that I didn't need.
5,VersaPak Gold Battery,"I have been using these rechargable batteries in cordless screwdrivers, cordless saws and dust busters for close to 20 years. They have always worked well for me. I will continue to use and buy them as long as Black & Decker keep making them."
3,B&D Versapack Gold Battery,"All in all, the Versapack series of tools are handy, but not of high quality and the batteries doesn't have much lasting power and wear out way too quickly. My choice are to either throw my tools away or keep buying these crappy batteries, which are over-priced."
3,Very Good Battery BUT,"I would have rated this a 5 star but when I saw the manufacture date as being in the middle of 2009, I was disappointed. Why is Amazon selling 2 year old batteries???????????? The date is stamped on the battery."
1,B&D Battery,"description of this item is somewhat lacking since it is not clear what the difference is between the gold and silver batteries. It also is not readily apparent that this item includes just one battery, while the silvers come in pairs."
1,New batteries would not hold a charge,"We ordered two of these batteries as replacements for silver batteries that we had been using and recharging for years in our Dustbuster 7.2v. We charged these new gold batteries for at least 24 hours before using them, but they still drained within only a few seconds -- fewer than 10 seconds. In spite of repeated attempts to charge the batteries, both in the Dustbuster and in the external charger, on only one occasion did the Dustbuster function for more than 5-10 seconds."
3,"the PAK is only 1 battery, NOT 2","It's not exactly the seller's fault but I thought I was buying a ""pair"" of these as the name is ""VersaPak"" and my drill takes 2 of them. I assumed they come as a ""Pack"" of 2. Instead turned out to be only 1 battery. Had I known the 2 would cost twice as much I would not have ordered (cheaper to buy a new drill). When I tried to click ""return"" button, I had to call for special handling item. Not worth it. I now have a ""VersaPak"" of one battery that I don't need and wasted the $ on it."
5,Highly useful walker.,"My mother, who fell on her tailbone, was given a basic walker with 2 rear legs for physical therapy. The rubber ends on the rear legs were leaving scuff marks all over our wood floor. Therefore, I bought the Rollite Rollator Junior. It has four wheels that don't scuff the wood floor. My mom loves the Rollator Junior because she can just stop and sit down wherever she chooses. For example, she sits in front of the refrigerator for food or the dryer when doing laundry. She also tranports her food, mail and laundry on the seat to wherever she wants to go. My mother is only 5'2"" which is why I bought the junior version. It folds up, has a seat, four wheels and is height adjustable."
1,Not what I bargained for,"Here's a minority opinion, evidently. I couldn't have been more disappointed! I didn't hear a single instrumental line I haven't heard Andreas do better on earlier recordings (and I have almost all his albums.) I always enjoy imagining the worlds and the stories that his melodies suggest to me. But with the lyrics and singing in the foreground on this album, I felt like I was being told how to interpret what I was hearing. And a 9 minute narrative ""guided tour?"" Talk about filler!As to the singing and the lyrics ... there are a million singer/songwriters out there (many of whom write better lyrics and sing far better) but there are very few composers of interesting music. I always found Vollenweider creative and original, but I thought he lost his muse on this one."
4,Dr. Sanchez,"I teach Molecular Biology for Biologyst students. This book has been a good tool to teach, because has all the main points that are need to know the bases of Microbial genetics. Other books are excellents but this book has the minimun to know and understand other books."
3,Not so great....,"I purchased this book with the intent on learning about laying my own forms, and pouring footings for a small garage addition. Although there is good information in the book, it is not cohesive, nor does it flow and in fact is quite dis-jointed. I did not learn what I needed to know about form building, but I did learn more than I really needed to know about several other areas of concrete work.I was really hoping that a ""project progression"" approach would have been a natural means of writing a book such as this, but I gambled and lost. This book goes on the shelf and I'm poorer for it's purchase."
2,poor book construction,"This is not really a book per se... it's a collection of disjointed articles all written by different authors. For example, one author says to use brick for ""dobies"" to space rebar off the ground, then the next author says to *never* do this, then some topics are addressed in 4 or 5 different places with no cohesion. There are definitely better books on the topic, although this may be good recreational bedside reading for some."
4,Good Read.,"After reading this book, I knew everything a DIYr should. In my case, I learned it was too much work and I hired a pro. You can tell if your pro is doing it right without the back breaking work.If you are young enough and good shape, you will learn what you have to do. If older like me, you will learn what you don't want to do.Good luck on your project."
3,Not bad,"I was looking for a book that would help me make better decisions during the construction of my new home. This book had some ideas, but doesn't go deep enough into any of the ideas or issues it raises."
3,Conair product delivered,"Not clear in the information on this product that I'd be getting a Conair product. Otherwise as described. Did what I needed for trip to more than 1 country...although be warned, once you get it you will find a large list of products that you can't use it with....including many of the items I bought for use with (hair dryers, flat irons etc). So my hair didn't look quite as nice as I wanted & I had to buy a dual voltage hair dryer....."
4,Franzus TS-2000Ck converter/adapter set,"The unit is simple, easy to use and small to carry. However, we cannot understand what is the real meaning of the ""high/low"" switch. We set the switch to ""low"" for fear of burning out the transformer. Manufacturer can easily set it at the ""high"" mode. Turtleneck."
3,They are not made in Japan,I'm not sure if I should give a review on this product or the seller.According to this product information they are made in Japan but the ink cartridges I got were made in Mexico and USA.The colors look fine so it's OK but I was just a bit disappointed.
4,I like it!,"The entire process was quicker and easier than buying them at Costco. And it was less expensive to boot. The same ink cartridges that I have bought elsewhere. All in all, a good experience."
5,Epson ink cartridges,"They were great . The exact same item that I have been purchasing at one of the business supply stores, but for a lot less."
2,get what I paid for,"Well I'd ordered before, had a great deal on cartridges About #24.00 as I remember.....Couldn't remember the dealer tho'......so this time ordered and paid $14.00 for similar cartridges...two of them clogged already...right out of the box. Better buy ""better"" cartridges."
2,Ink Stink,"The product works fine, but tend to dry out too soon. I have had more cartridges dry out than used up."
1,ink for R220,"I just received my order for ink for my Epson R220. the ink cartridges are not Epson as advertise, they are a NanoDigital brand and on top of that they are not made for my printer. A waste of time, now I have to return them and orderother ones."
3,"Genuine Epson Ink cartridges, for R200,R220, R300,RX500,RX600,RX620",not sure if I bought these particlar ones. mine were not new perhaps refurbished maybe even a knock off. It was a $13 special. Had an issue with the cyan not working well and it took several cleaning passes to have it come out of it. It has been working well enough since. It was cheap enough and worked well enough for me but not 5 star good
3,"Marketplace was a good deal, but...","I ordered this through one of the marketplace sellers for $38. A much better deal, BUT, be attentive. The seller (notice I'm not naming him here, because it was an honest mistake) allegedly misfiled my order into the ""already shipped"" pile, and after three emails to him he finally realized the mistake and made good on it. The order arrived and seems fine, all original, sealed epson carts. Haven't used them yet."
3,too many fillers,The best EMCEE on this Cd has got to be the B-I-G D-A-DoubleD-Y K-A-N-E.Showin' most of these ametures on this compilation how it should be done.Chalk another one up for the True School.Other stand-outs worthy of head knoddin' songs are Tame 1 and the brother on track #10.Also Royce Da 5'9 could have done done much better.Still though if your into Underground Hip Hop this is a decent effort but besides those mentioned above where's the talent?Some rappers stay underground for a reason.Salute!!!!
4,Great Way to learn about the master players,I purchased this video for my 10-year old nephew. He is interested in learning about players from the 1980's and Dr. J is his favorite. P.S. My brother also is enjoying it!
4,Great idea - wish I had thought of it!,"I bought this two winters ago. It's kind of expensive for what you get, but it works. You can dry 4 pairs of boots and 4 pairs of gloves/mittens at the same time. It takes a good 12 hours to dry something that's really wet. But, usually the kids are coming in around 5:00PM and don't need their stuff again till 8:00AM the next morning, so it's not really an issue. I believe if the fan was more powerful that it could dry stuff in half the time. I may still try to mount a bigger fan on it. As far as construction, it is built pretty sturdily. We actually cut some of the hoses shorter for the kids gloves as they wouldn't reach the holding clips. Now it's fine. Overall I rate it 4 stars because the only thing it lacks is a more powerfull fan."
1,The Worst Movie Ever,"For people that don't have a taste for B movies, the idea of collecting bad movies doesn't make any sense. I enjoy seeing the final product, a labor of love, which is ultimately a failure in every aspect. Poor acting, writing, cinematography, and directing through some sort of bizarre math actually add up to something worth watching. It's endearing to see the complete lack of talent put forth so much effort.And so it becomes a quest to find the WORST movie.This is the worst movie I have ever seen. I am not expecting to find a movie worse than this. My quest is over.Unfortunately, there was no weird math to save this movie. It just completely failed to entertain in every aspect, but it didn't feel like anyone put the love into it to make it work. I watched it once and doubt I'll watch it again."
1,no way to attach flag pole to kayak and pole too short,"They shipped just the flag with no pole the first time. When I complained, I got a 3 foot long pole with no way to attach it to my kayak - no mounting hardware. I need something much longer so people will not run over my kayak coming around a bend in tall everglades grass with an airboat. This is not useful for that purpose. The pole looks like it can be combined with another section, so maybe they only sent half a pole. Also there is no way to attach the flag to the pole. Anyway the whole thing was a disappointment, and the delay getting the pole to me made me miss the return window. It is a low margin item, and if they are not serious about selling a real and useful product, they should remove it from their catalog."
2,Dommage que....,"Dommage que ces airs proviennent de diff√©rents enregistrements et d'√©poques - la tonalit√©e entre les airs est mal align√©e - Sinon...Bof....sans plus..pas vraiment indispensable , en tout cas pas ce a quoi on s'attend - Christian (France)"
3,good... but could be better,"bought to shade small patio and back door from harsh west sun. does help some. not as high quality as expected from price and name: not as dark, very light weight, uneven edges, shifts to the left constantly along bottom ridge, end caps have to be glued in to stay put, and plastic pull chain looks very cheap. would look for better quality even if costs a little more."
5,"Love it! But, can they be cut to size?","I bought 2 of these shades at Lowes for my porch. I love them. Great fabric. I want to get another one, but it needs to be 87"". Since they only come in 4', 6', 8', 10', I was wondering if I could cut the 8' size down to 87"". Has anyone tried this?"
1,Not Suited for Large Dogs (fabric too weak),"I have an English Mastiff - that is about 165lbs and the Coolaroo seemed like the perfect fit for her. She really liked using it, but after about a month of use, it started to sag and develop holes in it. The holes eventually turned into splits and it was destroyed within a month. The holes were not chew holes, but caused by her stepping on it and being poked by her toe nails. Even with trimmed nails, simply her weight and feet started to damage the bed and has resulted in a life expectancy for the fabric of about a month. The frame is still fine. I called for warranty on this and Coolaroo says that they only cover sun damage (not an issue in this case since the bed is indoors) and not wear/tear. So be warned that if you have a large dog and it has nails that this might not be the best product for you and your pet."
4,Coolaroo shade,"While the shade is very effective and looks good in place, the fact remains that the chain by which you operate the rollup/down function is too short. It is necessary for me to climb on a stool to operate it. It seems that they did not take into account that the shade might be mounted on a window any higher than 8 feet and made the chain only as long as the shade, without any apparent option for lengthening it.Calling the company to attempt to purchase a longer chain or an extension has not resulted in any help."
3,Great shade but...............,"This is a great shade. It blocks that summer Missouri sun. My complaint with this is the shipping. It was shipped in a flimsy plastic container with just plastic wrapped around it. One spot on the aluminum top rail was slightly damaged. This needs to be sent in an actual carboard box or tube since the plastic isn't designed for shipping. Of course, we already had it up when we noticed the damage (you couldn't tell until you were letting it down) and it's not worth taking it down now. If you can buy this product in a store I would do that in lieu of having this shipped."
1,"Very difficult to install, screws too small for blind","I have the 96"" outdoor blind, and installing it (for a seasoned and handy person) was very difficult. The screws are way too small to hold the weight of the blind. The holes for the screws must be precisely pre-drilled, and you are installing the screws in the holes 'blind' - Coolaroo assumes you have periscopic vision. You will need 1-2 other people to assist in positioning the blind up to the screw holes and installing the screws. I bought much longer screws, as the teeny ones included are clearly insufficient. Bottom line - you have to really n-e-e-d this blind to go through the installation hassle. My strong suggestion - select a different brand."
1,Excellent price...until you receive ONLY 1 roll,I would suggest not ordering this tape. Text has that it is for case of 9 rolls and only received 1 roll. Spoke with Amazon chat and had second order sent out for free and received 1 roll AGAIN. Received refund for their error.
2,Worst tape ever!,I did not enjoy using this tape at all. It is the worst I have ever seen. It is similar to those cheap tapes you can usually find in ....Stay away from this and save your money or spend it on something else like 3M's tape.
3,Perlman in Russia Lacks Complete Performance,"I received my Perlman in Russia DVD today from Amazon.com. I am very disappointed with it, as they did not include the complete Tchaikovsky violin concerto, just the 3rd movement, as was the case with the VHS. I had thought that since this was a two DVD set, it would contain the complete Tchaikovsky concerto but it does not. I digitized my VHS copy onto one DVD with very good results. With two DVDs included with this new DVD set, EMI had plenty of room on the DVD to include the complete concerto. My advice would be if you have the VHS tape or a digitized copy of it, save your money and do not buy this new 2 DVD set of Perlman in Russia. Perlman is fabulous as always but not including the complete Tchaikovsky violin concerto in this DVD set is unbelievable. That is why I rate this DVD set with only 3 stars."
5,Please bring it back!,"I've had this slow cooker four years now and never had a problem. It cooks items so much more efficiently and evenly than any crock pot I've ever used.Plus anything on the counter--a bread bag, etc.--is shielded from the heat because of thick insulated plastic surrounding the crock and heating element.It cleans up well, is the perfect size and the black version I have is attractive enough to stay on my counter year-round. The only problem I have is I can't find another one to buy for my daughter. I've looked around at other models and haven't found another one that seems as well insulated and as well made as this one."
4,Makes you tingle!,"I like how you can substitute your own liquid ingredient such as water, juice (carrot/tomato) or even green tea to tailor the mask to your needs. This product leaves your skin so smooth and it really is like having a luxurious spa treatment in your very own bedroom. I'm quite disappointed to read that Clorox bought the company, though I appreciate this information because it will definitely influence future purchases."
4,Good mask,"I'm not exactly a fan of how liquid-y this mask is, or the fact that it makes my face red after using.Even if I add much more powder than water, it is still about the consistency of water.However, this does make the mask easier to spread.The smell is absolutely intoxicating, and it really does feel like my face is getting a good treatment with the pleasing tingle.Burt's Bees mask is full of ingredients perfect for oily skin; like French green clay, peppermint, rosemary, and sage.It's been great for my blackheads. They've minimized slightly with just a couple uses."
3,Item recieved was different than the item pictured,"We just received this trike yesterday. The trike we received was slightly different. The wood is a lighter color. The knobs are white rather than black. The rear part of the seat is wood colored wather than the black in the picture. The wheels are just solid white rather than the off color ""mag"" wheels shown. While the differences are cosmetic, hat we received definitely looks cheaper than the item shown above. Also, as I pulled the frame from the box, a piece of the laminate chipped away. Its from the bottom of the trike and its a small piece, so I wasn't overly concerned. I would normally just return this and search for another option but this is a gift for my twins first birthday and there isn't time to shop and order something else. Amazon really should pull down the picture and replace it with an accurate representation."
2,"Unsturdy, poor design","While good looking, this trike didn't even last six months. The design always puzzled me: the steering column never passed smoothly over the frame and after a couple weeks, deep groves appeared on the frame. Another design flaw that may raise eyebrows: when the child is moving forward, the rear wheels ride up on his heels, which leaves red marks and eventually may scrap some skin off the back of his heels. While he didn't seem bothered by this, I just can't believe that he found this comfortable. Finally, just today, the entire steering column broke off the bike, freeing the two front wheels to fall off the bike. Bad value and bad design."
4,Fridge - Happiness,"Fridge lets you know exactly what you're getting into with their _Happiness_ album: for track titles, they instead list the major instruments. So, for instance, ""Melodica and Trombone"" has exactly that (along with a quiet, spacious ending). ""Drum Machines and Glockenspiels"" has... well, you can guess. But this is Fridge, so it's more than simply an instruments list; there's the delicate post-rock contemplation. The glimmering and gorgeous ""Cut Up Piano and Xylophone"" shows that they have more than sustained guitars up their sleeves. Indeed, oftentimes, the stated instrument, as in ""Five Four Child Voice,"" takes a backseat to Fridge's own compositions. It's almost like a bait-and-switch! But ""Harmonics"" remains pure, with equal measures of plucking and strumming and carefully constructed sonics. Fridge knows how to induce happiness like the best of them."
2,Would not purchase again,"I bought this for my son to use since he has a sensitive scalp and it indeed felt good to him until, almost immediately the green cushion with the bristles attached kept popping out and takes a long time to work back in.He does not have thick hair or it would be impossible to use. This is either a faulty design or it should have been glued. Wouldn't recommend.Way to expensive for what you get."
4,Best prodect ever!,This is the only hair-tamer product I've ever used that actually works. I think AlbertoVO5 is crazy for discontinuing it!
5,Great product,"This product doesn't straighten my very curly, frizzy hair as I would hope possible, but it does make my hair feel stronger and silky. It's healthier and easier to manage. I absolutely love it and suggest you at least try it once. Seriously."
5,VO5 Straight Gel,This is the best straight gel on the market. It keeps my hair straight all day and it keeps it soft and smooth even after blow drying and flat ironing too.
4,Good for occasional use,My wife says product is good and works as promised but she would not use it on daily basis.I would recommended this product to a friend.
1,poor quality!,"This is the third external drive enclosure I purchased of this brand (Coolmax). The first two I bought about 3 years ago and they worked out fine. Given my good experiences, I decided to buy another one. In the years since I purchased the earlier ones, the manufacturer has cheapened the product!1. The hard drive is no longer held in by screws, but via 4 very cheap plastic ""springs"" that make it nearly impossible to get the drive in. Once in, you'll never get it out again!2. There used to be a ""sled"" on which the drive was mounted, and the electronics were firmly attached to the sled. Now the electronics consist of a small circuit board with the connectors (data and power) connected to the end. I suspect that installing and removing a drive more than a few times will break off the connectors.I returned the item to Amazon."
5,I Have No Problems,"I have no problems with this enclosure. Hookup was simple (MacOSX). Cables were included. Not loud. Spins up and down as needed. I use it as a boot volume as well, and have ZERO problems with it. I am VERY satisfied, and have looked into buying another."
2,Should re-name this CD Deja Vu,"Wow, pretty weak effort. Not one of his best. Listening to the CD, I wasn't even aware there were multiple tracks on it since they all sounded alike. Skip this disk and play one of his earlier CD's."
2,Disappointing,"The old definition of ""chutzpah"" was murdering your parents and then pleading for leniency from the court because you were an orphan. The new definition is charging money for this product. It should be included with Motorola's phones for free.I don't use this product to sync my calendar and address book with my RAZR. Apple's OS X does that easily and with no additional software/fee. I bought it so that I could add customized ring tones.Working on another computer using Windows XP, I've had to reinstall the software practically every time I wanted to use it. The software refuses to recognize my RAZR even though Windows does. After repeated attempts to get the software to recognize my phone, I resort to uninstall/reinstall, which works every time.Fortunately, I don't need this product every day."
1,Motorola Phone Tools 4.0,I installed this software on my IBM thinkpad running windows 2000. The software would not detect my Motorola Razr when connected via USB. I gave up after two hours of reinstalls and reconnections with no success.
1,Verizon blocks the usefull features,"1. Ask Verizon how to transer photos from phone.2. Verizon sells you software - Motorola Phone Tools3. Photos won't tranfer - feature blocked by Verizon.4. Bang head against wall while Verizon rep says ""Sucker!"""
1,Motorola Phone Tools- Will NOT work with XP-Media Edition,Watchout if you buy Phone Tools and think it will work with XP media edition You may have bought a red herring! No money back on this one. Get a new computer or reinstall windows XP Professional. and then....maybe it will work.Was disappointed in the fine print for this one......ooops
1,Very difficult to use.,"I don't know of a better solution, but this thing barely works.You need to reboot your computer before using it, and make this the first application you open. And THEN it MIGHT work for you, at least a little.Terrible, Motorola, just terrible.-Stephen"
3,Motorola phone tools,"We thought this is what we needed, but no one (not even Motorola) would tell us this would not work with our phones. If your phone is out of warranty, Motorola will refuse to update the software. Any phone older than about 1 year will not be able to use this kit for anything other than backing up your contacts. Older phones CAN NOT add pictures or ring tones or update software.Phone tools does update to the Phone tools software to thge latest released version - 5.27, but that doesn't help."
1,phone tools 5.0 sucks,I got this to sync my contacts from outlook to my old V3 razr motorola cell. I have used it a dozen times and it has NEVER completed a sync succesfuully. I creates duplicate contacts which I have to manually delete and the calendar information is too fouled up to read. Don't waste your money on this piece of crap software. There is zero help available for the product and the online help is piss poor at best.
3,Does NOT support some Verizon Phones,"Verizon Wireless is attempting (from what I have seen) to make all their phones incompatable with this type of software... ""preferring"" that you go through their ""get it now"" or transferring through them (at a charge) to transfer any pictures, ringtones, etc.Not Motorola's fault... however they should state incompatability problems with Verizon phones or (preferably) just refuse to manufacture phones for Verizon without all features enabled."
1,WARNING: Does NOT work with Vista,"The title says it all... though I have read that MPTv4 is Vista friendly, THIS product did NOT work with my new Vista OS.Find the one that does and be sure it is labeled to be Vista compatible before you purchase it."
2,Motorola Mobile Phone Tools 4.0,"Motorola Mobile Phone Tools 4.0 is a useful piece of software provided you are successful installing it onto your computer. It worked well on one of my computers, and was nearly impossible to install on my laptop. After hours of frustration, it is only partially functional. Make sure you get the lowest possible price, for it is practically worthless. The consumer ought to be reimbursed for troubleshooting this product. The company that made it should be ashamed. On the bright side, the updates are graphically pretty and appear to solve the problem of your phone not being recognized."
2,Sprint MotoKRZR KM1,"I can't, for the life of me, get this to work with my MotoKRZR Km1. I've downloaded the newest drivers a couple of times, yet still can't get my phone to connect to the computer. Strangely, there are drivers for the RAZR phone, which should be internally identical to the KRZR, right? If nothing else, at least I now have a USB cable to charge my phone via my computer."
1,Ditto - does not work.,"...at least with a v25. All multimedia disabled. Save your money & get freeware ""send to phone"", or equivilant... THIS works for ring tones & wallpaper."
1,Did not work with Verizon Motorola Raza V3m,"From the phone set up wizard - ""Please make sure your phone is not locked."". The product description does not mention this."
1,CD DID NOT WORK,CD did not work.Had to download the softward from some site.And then came to know that my phone model is not in the list.I was asked to contact Motorola directly.Good luck with the purchase.
2,Doesn't Work As Advertised!,motorolas description of these phone tools is that you can download the photos from your phone to your pc but it seems that some of the razrs do not even allow this option! of all the options advertised being part of phone tools 4.0 only 2 were installed and supported by my phone (motorola RAZR) beware check for compatiblity.
1,Not worth it,"Does not work with all models as advertised by seller. Cost just as much to return the product as it is to purchase the product so I am stuck with an item that I can not use. Seller should not tell me as a buyer that I can look on the internet for upgrades, Seller should have such support available...this item seems to be something copied and sold with out Motorola's knowledge or consent. Good luck....BUYER BEWARE"
4,Average software,"The price I paid for this package was good, but the cost of shipping negated the low price. I had seen lower price from other web retailer, $8 with free shipping. Most advertizements online include just one cable. This phone tool package has two cables, one for mini-USB and one for other non-mimi-USB phones. I guess the extra cable is worth a few dollars. The software does not have much on it, but you need it to manage your phone book on your cell phone and to make your own mp3 ring tones and upload to it. Other phone maker like Samsung, you can download similar utilities for free from their website."
1,InOperability with 325i,"This product doesn't seem to work with the 325i I got from Verizon. The outlook syncronization works, but downloading ring tones or transfering pictures to or from the phone does not. I find all kinds of noise on the net regarding problems. The product needs better online product support regarding different motorola phones and Windows versions. I intend to try this on my Windows XP system when I get home. I also wish it would bring up the different phone numbers that Outlook has and match those that are available on the different phone models (e.g., home, home2). I think to start with the company should provide a cross reference of functionality between each of the different phones and operating system and which phone vendors (Verizon, Cingullar, etc.) options are blocked or unavailable."
4,Great Motorola product,"I recently purchased the Motorola Mobile Phone Tools for my Motorola L6 cell phone. After installing the program, I found it very easy to navigate through the windows to see exactly what I wanted to do. Overall, I feel that this is a great product for people that like to save money on ringtones and wall paper. If you are buying this product for the other options (Outlook, Internet) you may want to shy away from it."
3,Fair software to access your phone's saved data,"The phone I have is the RAZR V3m and it works when you tell the software you have a V3cm phone, which I had to contact Motorola customer service to first find out.Not sure if its a quirk between Verizon my service provider or Motorola itself, but after several downloads to update the software it recognized my phone outright as a V3m, rather than having to call it a V3cm.The software doesn't backup my contact list but it doest work well for transferring files like midi files and pictures."
1,worthless,will not work with verizon wireless.Mobile Phone Toolswould have been nice to know this before buying
1,"doesn't work, even on FOUR computers","I am a college student living on campus. I have a desk top and my two roommates have laptops. While attempting to install on my computer, multiple error messages came up. Alright I'll try my roommates computers. On each of theirs, NEW error messages came up. Each of the three computers yielded three separate error messages. Wow, I guess I have to try my computer at home. I go all the way home on the weekend and try this for a FOURTH time. A new error message comes up. I've tried this on four computers with the same result. The product sucks. All I want to do is unload my pictures and videos to a computer, but apparently that is too much to ask. DO NOT BUY this product, it is a complete waste of money."
2,old version..will not update to 5.0 does not work with Verizon,"This is the old version..did not even recog. my Rizar z6. I called moto they told me to get ver. 5.0. And after all the new download and hassel of the upgrade,it only has the phone book capability for Verizon none of the other features work. If you want to use this to access the internet from the phone, u will need to have the verizon data package ( 49/month??)"
1,Motorola phone tools 4.0,"I have a fairly new computer (6 months old) with Vista. When I tried to install the phone tools, it crashed windows explorer. I repeated the procedure several time with the same results.Upon reviewing the internet, I found out only phone tools 4.51 or higher would work with vista. Since I could not even open the programs on the CD, I am guessing I had an older version.Between the time I ordered phone tools 4 and my attempts at installation, phone tools 5 was released.Even though phone tools upgrades are free, I could not get the program to open. The software should work on xp, so if you have a dual boot computer, down load the program then updating may be a solution.I had to return the software and have ordered the new version."
3,works as advertised,"installed the tools, let it get the current update, and (typical windows) had to reboot the pc and the phone a couple of times. but it works nicely now. basically I use it to back up my phone telephone numbers and to move files on and off my PC. ringtone management appears to be nice. not bad for the price."
4,Motorola Phone Tools,"The s/w required a visit to the creators website and interaction w/support personnel to get information on my latest cell phone. After down loading the latest version, the product was able to add phone numbers, but could not update the phone calendar. I have not tried the other features."
2,"Gets the job done, but it's glitchy.","Not intuitive. User interface is complicated, didn't recognize my phone automatically, and had to update the software half a dozen times before it would even sync my calendar in addition to my contacts. Plus, my Outlook just hasn't been the same since; appointments are disappearing and reappearing, etc. Like having my calendar on my phone, but doesn't do me much good if it's not accurate. Guess I'll have to look into a PDA next time."
1,Was not Mobile Phone Tools 4.0,This was not Mobile Phone Tools 4.0. I did receive software and cable but I installed the software and it would not recognize my phone(KRZR). The disc doesn't even look like the one pictured which is how the offical one is supposed to look like. I ended up going to the offical MOTOROLA website and downloaded the software for 40 bucks. I installed and it works perfectly. I bought another disc prior to this one from a different website claiming it was motorola phone tools 3.0 and that didn't recognize my phone either(stay away from the blue and white disc that has japanese writing on it)and stay away from the brownish grey disc. Infact there are a dozen sellers on this website claiming they have it but save yourself the pain and confusion of trying to decide who is legit and just download it from the Motorola Website. It will make this process MUCH MORE easier and less confusing then it should be.
3,"Not bad, BUT","...if you're a Verizon Wireless customer, you'll need to hack your phone to get the full functionality of this software with Motorola phones -- specifically the RAZR and possibly other models. Without the hack, you cannot transfer mp3 files, pictures, or make and transfer your own ringtones to the phone.If you hack the phone, the software is decent. The hack isn't too difficult. Here's a good site to get you started.[...]"
4,WORKS NICE,THE CD DIDN'T LOOK LIKE THE ONE PICTURED & I WAS UNEASY ABOUT IT BUT IT WORKS JUST LIKE THE DESCRIPTION SAYS. IT IS EASY TO LOAD IF YOU FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS THAT ARE ON THE CD. BE SURE NOT TO PLUG IN YOUR PHONE UNTIL INSTRUCTED. IT SYNCS EASILY WITH OUTLOOK & TRANSFERS PICTURES BETTER THAN I EXPECTED.
1,No Outlook 2007 Support,"Motorola Phone Tools 4.0 has no Outlook 2007 suppport. Ordered the product only to find this out after i received it and wondered how to sync my information. Searched Motorola website to find no answers related to 2007 support, so i called their help desk and they told me they don't supoort 2007 with this version of Phone Tools. Very disappointed. Not sure of it's ability to work with 2003 cause i don't have that loaded yet."
1,ETMC Company Motorola Phone Tools,"It did not work! It was not digitally signed, and not an official Motorola product. Do not buy this product. It did not meet OEM specifications. It was a disk made by this company and sold as a Motorola product. They only allow you to return it if you want another of the same in return. I wrote them and told them about their product, and they told me they would refund my money. I haven't heard a thing yet."
1,oem i think not,"what was pictured was the oem mtorola phone tools 4 , what was recieved was a japanese version . dont even know for sure if cd is #4 version , i doubt it ! not even gonna install . [...]"
2,Limited,"Beware, this product is very limited for a Motorola V750. Most of the features are unavailable. The only thing you can do with it is transfer phone contacts and calendar items. However, calendar items only transfer if they are not ""reoccuring"" items, or if they are not ""meeting requests."" I bought this product, just to transfer photos, but this feature is unavailable for my phone. Wonderful."
1,Worse than a watching Ishtar!,"This was recommended by the kid at the Verizon store for my Razor 3m. He said buy it, upgrade it and you'll be good to go for syncing contacts and calendar. I got it to work ONCE! and then it never has worked again. I uninstall and reinstall on Windows XP. Forget working with Vista, it's hopeless.PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS. I have never been this adamant against a product. I'd rather through $49.00 out the window so someone gets some enjoyment from my money."
3,This program is so annoying!,"As stated in other reviews, Motorola should not be charging for this silly software. I needed a new phone as my blackberry was finally dying on me and opted for the ""free"" motorola W460 phone that was available for extending my contract. Motorola and RIM use the same miniUSB cables so I had all the equipment that I needed to ""sync"" everything except this software. I didn't even want to create any ring tones, just download my contacts, which it does - sort of. Mapping the fields was a pain. I wouldn't recommend the software but unfortunately it's a neccessary evil with Motorola."
1,Verizon Customers,"If your wireless carrier is Verizon, this product's multimedia tools will not work. I bought it to transfer photos from my phone and that function is blocked by Verizon."
2,Don't bother if you have Nextel Phones,"Another product with decent design and idea. However, if you own a locked phone regardless of carrier, you cannot get full feature use unless you buy an unlock code so that you can tap into the complete ability of your phone. Regardless of the advertising and packaging, it does not work for ""all"" phones."
3,Functional but not intuitive,"A helpful device if you can figure it out. If you are an old geezer that is not tech savvy, just stick to the features your phone already has. Avoid our experience, which was an exercise in endless confusion and non-productiveness."
3,"A bit buggy, but it works","Loads fine in XP and Vista. Get the updates first thing.Had a couple of lock ups, but it does OK for what I wanted. It's worth $20.00... but not the $50 that Motorolla asks on their website!"
4,Phone Tools,I use Windows Vista and the program had to be updated after installation from disc but seems to work fine. I also use Outlook 2007 and it integrates great with outlook. Auto synch was a little confusing but this may be dependent on your phone and not Outlook.
2,Not for the KRZR K1m,Well as I discovered there really is no driver made for the KRZR K1m. I'm gonna go through the driver list provided and see if some other driver will work. No luck so far though. At least I got it to charge via my pc's USB port by getting a different driver from a different website. Ohh well maybe they'll make a driver someday...
2,not for a K1,"I'm very dissapointed... install the tool but it does not recognize my K1s... reinstall, install, try to update it and the K1 is not in the list of compatible phones for this software... waste of money... it should come with the phone... at least I can use the cable to download pictures, songs and movies to the memory card. Make sure there is an update for this software about the K1 before buy it."
2,Doug S.,"Beware! Verizon disables the multimedia option on some of its phones, specifically the RAZR V3m, making this software next to useless for me. Luckily, It was inexpensive."
2,Glad I only paid $15......,"Tried to load the software on 3 different computers. Would not load. Finallt got it to load one day and then it wouldn't ""initialize"" with the phone. Sold it at my garage sale for someone else to play with..."
2,Shame on you Motorola,"Shame on Motorola for creating software this horrible! Half the time it says the phone is not plugged in and the other half it makes me run through a new hardware installation process when I plug my phone in. Jesus, could a giant company of your calibre done any worse? Next time farm the software part out to a company that can get the job done right."
1,Not understanding....,"The product itself looked like what I needed, and it was new in package. But I still can't use my phone like it was advertised. Maybe it's a problem with my subscriber, but I am not happy with the situation. Also, I wonder why this product cost me $6.50, but on the Motorola website it's listed at $50?"
2,Be careful of generic item,"Ordered this product and received Motorola cables but with what seems to be a burned CD-ROM. Either it was produced in or for China (label on CD has Chinese characters on it). The CD-ROM label seems to have been made on some amateur's computer. Definitely not Motorola's original CD. The three items (2 cables and 1 CD-ROM) were thrown into a bubble envelope. No box, no descriptions. I give this two stars since I ordered it for the sole purpose of getting new cables."
1,DO NOT BELIEVE IT!!!!,"IF YOU HAVE MOTOROLA NEXTEL PHONE STOP!!!THE USB CORD IS TO SMALL IT DOESN'T FIT AT ALL AND IT STATES IT CAN BE USED FOR ALL MOTOROLA PHONES.IT ONLY GETS A 1 STAR BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO RATE IT, I GIVE IT A BIG FAT O !!!"
5,Love this product,"Everything was very promptly delivered. This was great. Installation was easy & seamless. Multiple connections for various motorola phones. Would definitely recommend to someone else, just a shame that motorola does not include this with their products"
2,Software did not live up to its billing,"The address feature was cool, but the other features are not clear cut or are missing. This product was a disappointment."
3,Too buggy!,"Making your own ringtones and such is awesome... but considering they MAKE you buy this instead of giving it to you with your phone, the bugs that it has are horrible.... Most of the time when I go into the multimedia section the proggy quits and asks if i want to send an error report. Also, the ringtones, once transferred over to the phone aren't really as loud as they should/could be... I've even tried editing the song in other software first and then just using the motorola software to get it to my phone.Disapointing."
5,Exactly as described!,"The item arrived quickly and was exactly as described. Plus, it is fun to use! Great product at a great price!"
1,Don't get if you have a Verizon phone,This will not work with Verizon phones. I got this info directly from Motorola.
1,NOT RETAIL PACKAGED,The product that arrived is not a retail packaged edition as indicated. It is OEM--a CD in a sleeve and 2 separate cables in plastic bags all mailed loose inside a bubble envelope mailer. The CD is covered with chinese text and the Motorola Phone Tools label does not appear as the label does on the Motorola website. I have not yet tried the software. But be forewarned--this is not retail.
3,Painful Install for a Useful Piece of Software,"The software is a pain to install. I am experienced but it took me all day to make it work. When I got it to work, there was no update for my phone model, the V197. I had to find a phone that emulates mine to even use the software. Now that I have the software running, it is easy to use.Motorola Mobile Phone Tools 4.0 for all Motorola Phones [Retail Packaged]"
5,Moto Phone Tools kit,"Received the kit very quickly and the Cd and the cable worked flawlessly.I had programmed a couple of numbers and names before I received the kit, but after I received the kit, the rest of the numbers sure went easier.One of the best features of Phone Tools to me is the ability to download ringtones to my computer then transfer them to the phone.I had read a lot of negative comments about Phone Tools, but I had absolutely no problems using the program/cable."
2,bad bad,If you have windows vista dont bother getting this cd. I've yet to get the darn program to recognize my phone. Motorola is not the easiest place to get customer support. I would say its a waste of money at this point. Too bad because I think it would be a great thing to have working.
4,Pretty Handy Tool,"This product is pretty reliable and works relatively well with my updated computer and Motorola V551 cell phone. The ring tone editing software is great, the synchronization process is relatively good, and photo cropping software, though simple, gets the job done.I have only have the software freeze up on me once and it was solved with a simple restart and it has not done it since. It has done the job for me and for anyone mainly interested in a ring tone editor for their phone this software/cable set will work well for you."
3,not worth it for some purposes,"I got this for use with my old v60i so i could Xfer my contacts to my razr v3m for verizon. However: 1. the v60i, although the graphic shows up on the computer after manually finding the device, is apparently too old, according to motorola customer service, to work with version 4.0; 2. if you're a verizon customer who does not work as a computer programmer or hacker (nor does it as a hobby), then forget it. With Backup Assistant available to Verizon users for $2/mo., it's not worth it to buy this software unless you've got so much calendar content that it would take you hours to hand-copy it into a computer calendar.In summary:For those with old phones: buy an older version of the software or find some freeware that'll work with the cable.For verizon users: forget it."
3,You get what you pay for!,"I received the Motorola Phone Tools 4.0 software and cables and was soooo excited to finally get my Slvr to sync with my notebook..and for WAY less than in a retail outlet...Well, first, the disc was defective and looked like a burned copy, not an original....The software vendor sent me a link to download the software, so that was fixed. BUT second, it can't find my phone....iTunes works beautifully, but I am still not able to backup my contacts and calendar on my PC through the tools program......very disappointing because now I have to contact Motorola support and try to figure out why it doesn't work.....My operating system is VISTA, so I'm guessing that'll be blamed!"
3,Phone Tools,"I thought I would be able to transfer all of my ringtones and images from my old phone to my new one. Unfortunately, most of them were ""locked"" even though I had purchased them so, I was unable to transfer them to my new phone. I still like the program and what I can do with it but that was my main reason for getting it in the first place so I was a bit disappointed."
1,Messed up...,"I ended up downloading this from the Official Motorola Website when the disc I bought from here didn't work on my computer. From the looks of it, it's from a different country because the disc is covered in Asian characters. The disc just started spinning over and over again without reading it. It was actually spinning really fast, which told me something was wrong. So I gave it a 1 star because it didn't work... Once I downloaded it from the website though, it worked perfectly. I recommend everyone just to get it from there. If you don't want to download it, you can ask for the actual disc and it'll come in the mail. Good Product... Bad Sale... From here... Go to the Motorola Store."
1,Can't browse internet,"The video and picture transfer and email writing features are good, but you can not browse the internet. This may or may not be a Windows XP problem, I don't know, but it really is a bummer that I can not get onto the internet."
3,Motorola Phone Tools 4.0,"I received this order quickly, it was an easy install, easy connection to the phone I was able to easily back up my wife's SIM card and upload a personal MP3 ring tone. Regrettable the next day my wife push her V3 in the washer. But the inital test drive of the CD and USB cable was very nice"
1,Beware: Won't Transfer Photos On Some Phones,"Beware! Everything I read indicated it would, but it doesn't transfer photos from my phone to my PC with the USB cord. It doesn't work on the W385 model I have. This is the only reason why I bought the software/USB cord kit. The software installation wasn't pleasant too. Motorola wasn't much help either when I contacted them; they talked about using a Blue Tooth, but they couldn't tell me what to get and said to contact my computer maker. Motorola and their vendors need to do a better job explaining what will and will not work with this software. Motorola was once a great company, but it's really slipping with this product."
2,didn't work for my version of razr v3 for pix/flix transfer,"I bought this after getting told by the customer service at the Motorola website it would work to transfer the photos from my old Razr V3. It transfers contact info, useless and an unnecessary waste of money in my opinion, but doesn't transfer photos or videos. I'm glad I didn't pay nearly $50 at the Motorola website for it. Motorola customer service later verified it wouldn't work for my phone after I contacted them when it didn't work. This would probably work well for newer phones, but I have to give it two stars based on my experience."
3,Did the Job.,"I purchased Moto Tools 4.0 to transfer the pictures off my Razor V3xx phones.The software would not load into my Windows XP sp3 home edition.Seems my previouswindows reinstalls created a few issues. Fortunately I had another computer withWindows XP Professional that I had just reinstalled the week before. The softwareloaded with out hitch. I was able to transfer the pictures from the computer to a CD.I have second Razor that has not been used for two years. I thought it was broke,screenwent blank when I dropped it back then. I was able to get the pictures off that phoneby using an old Go Phone simm chip and recharging. The phone came back to life.In my opinion the problems I encountered are caused by the MS Windows updates. Theolder XP Professional has no updates nor was it connected to the Internet when I installed thesoftware. Buying this software is like a flip of a coin. If your not computer savy thiscould be a waste of time and money.Ed Kozak"
3,"Usable, if quirky","It's not supposed to work with Verizon phones. That said, some functions do work with my Verizon phone.Synchronizes with Outlook contacts; sync completes, though there is a message claiming it fails.Interface is reasonably easy to navigate, though there is some redundancy of function, and a few arehard to find."
1,Call and ask EXACTLY what you are getting before buying.,"I was not thrilled when I opened the envelope for this item, the reasons follow:1)it was not in its Motorola Retail Packaging, making me wonder if it was bootlegged or counterfeit.2) It did not contain the disc pictured, it had a V2.0 disc with ""oriental"" printing on it.3) No, manuals with it.I called customer service and they said that it was the right disc, that when I installed it, it would automatically update to the current version. It did NOT. Called Cust Serv again, they then sent a V4.0 disc. Recieved a V3.? disc, with the same ""oriental"" writing. Installed it anyway, and it did finally update to most current version.Do your research."
5,very satisfied,satisfied with product was hard to use at first because new phone was so new support was not up to date. Within a week all was well and running great!
3,Works okay,"I've had a few issues with it, but nothing to render it useless.Ringtone editor wouldn't save or transfer my edited file, so I had to do it in Audacity and then transfer it to my phone.No installation problems in Vista, but (weirdly enough!) have had problems in XP. It seems to enjoy crashing."
1,Don't waste your money.,"You can eventually figure out how to use Windows Explorer and Windows Media Player to work with your Motorola phone, although it is not straightforward. Do not buy Motorola Phone Tools. It doesn't work at all. Brand new Motorola phone. Brand new Motorola software. The software says it can't recognize the phone, so update the software. You choose to update the software and it says software cannot be updated. It's like a bad joke: ""Wouldn't it be cool if our software did all the things we said it would? Ha ha. Too bad. You don't get your money back, either."""
1,Worthless,"Only works on unlocked versions of the razr phone. It never detects your phone itself, you have to figure out which phone you have and configure it manually every time. It's completely worthless software. Just download your ringtones, and send your pictures to your own e-mail address. Avoid this junk at all costs, no matter the price (I paid only 11.00$, and I still feel ripped off)."
2,The user experience is about as good as Lotus Notes...,"The MPT software is about as easy to use as Lotus notes...If you've ever used Lotus Notes for e-mail, you'll understand; Notes is functional (with respect to e-mail), but it's far from intuitive. You can do almost anything with Notes that you can do with Outlook or pine or thudnerbird or gmail, but, it's done differently and with a human factors experience that just doesn't quite match up with what you'd expect.Basically, I think the Motorola Phone Tools software is functional, but difficult to navigate and use. It's not intuitive, it's not simple, and it's not elegant. Synchronizing an address book and calendar entries can be done, but you'll have to learn the ""MPT way"" to do it.If you're willing to work at it, you can do what you need to do."
1,MPT 4.0,I do not like this product. I have not been able to get it to recognize my phone or connect to my phone. So I have not been able to use its features. Hours of frustration were spent trying to install it.
3,"Something great, but not quite","GOODMakes it much easier to enter and maintain contacts, and calendar events.Charging from you computer is convenientSynchronization (when it works) is quite goodSerendipity: If your corp/org uses Outlook for scheduling, all your meetings will synchronizeBADWhen I tell it to transfer or synchronize it will often error 1, 2, 3 or more times before linking, then link fineStories about Verizon blocking the picture, video, and music transfer capability are TRUE, but can be cracked by the savvy and/or adventurous with a down-loadable Motorola utilityUGLYInstallation on newer model phones was a hell; you need a procedure from actual software vendor with a link buried on the Motorola website to make it accept update data for the newer model phones. DO NOT CONNECT THE PHONE UNTIL DIRECTED TO DO SO!"
3,Just an OK product,"Honestly, I really could've done without the aggravation of owning MPT. I think it would've just been easier to copy ringtones from my husband's Nokia. Ahhh, if only I'd known then what I know now.The first problem I had was that the USB cord that came with the software was dead. I didn't know this until about 4 days after I had started trying to use MPT. I finally got fed up with MPT not ""seeing"" my phone & bought a Bluetooth adapter for my computer. Little did I know that MPT is only compatable with certain Bluetooth dongles. Long story short, I had to jump through hoops to find out how to get my dongle to work with MPT & then still ended up using a completely different program to create my ringtones. So, I'm not even sure that I really needed MPT at all.I'm going to look on the bright side & chalk it all up to experience. I gave it 3 stars because I was able to transfer pictures from my phone to my computer fairly easily after I got MPT to work with my BT dongle."
2,tool for motorola phone,having a problem geting it to work with my razr phone. software seem to be to old for the model that I have.
4,Works just dandy,"Installs easily, works nicely and the update included the image of my phone, KRZR K1. It has some issues in Auto Sync mode, (BSoD WTF??) but Synch feature works great from Outlook. How does AT&T sell this for $50?"
2,back level software,"although this item appeared to be what i was looking for it turned out to be a back level, which is not compatable with windows 7 and is useless to me. i realize this is my fault, but let the buyer beware."
2,The only game in town,This wasn't the most convenient software to use but since it's the ONLY way to get data off the Motorola Razr phone it is what it is.
1,Only because I can't give it zero stars.,"Tried MPT with VE465 and W845. Wouldn't work. Went to the support site and did what they said. Didn't work. I concur with the other reviewers, this dog won't hunt."
1,Does not work on Model V220,This product does not work with Model V220 as it states on thr Amazon website.
1,This Sofware is Junk!!!!!,"I got the MPT program in hopes that it would make managing my phone contacts easier. Instead it deleted all my phone contacts. Using customer service, I was able to recover most of them. So I gave it a second chance when I needed to enter a large group of new contacts (thinking that entering the contacts using my computer would be quicker). But the stupid layout of the contact creator is so complicated that it was futile, and contained many useless data entries that are of no use. I ended up just entering the contacts manually in the phone like I always do. What a dogpile of a program!"
2,Still confused,"I bought this for my motorola w376g. The cable fit into the phone, which was a relief. But the software wasn't detecting my phone, and after a while it brought up a list of phone models to choose from. Nothing even close came up! I mainly bought this for ringtones from CDS and transferring pictures. I say just get ringtones online if your phone has a web browser, and email your phone's pictures to yourself if it has a web browser. Maybe someday I'll figure this software out."
3,Price can't be beaten,"Motorola is still selling this thing for $50, while I got it here for $6.50.The computer still may not recognize your phone after installing this software. My Sprint RAZR V3M was not recognized. You can solve this by downloading a separate program from Motorola's website for free: Motorola Software Update. Just do a search in google. Install the Motorola Software Update program AFTER you install Phone Tools."
3,It has its bad days,"It works most of the time. Sometimes it says ""mobile not connected"" when the data cable is connected and my computer recognizes it.I really like the Multi-Media Studio."
3,Free Software works Almost as good,"The MTP 4.0 is a nice set and it works great. but the free software i was able to find on the net was capable of doing more. While the MTP was more user friendly, i am a power user i like to get as far inside my gadgets as possible and MTP doesn't even support SEEM editing.For the end user this is a great package with a lot of benefits for computer sync. But for the power user this package will feel week and limited."
2,Motorola Mobile Phone Tools,"The transaction with the vendor was just fine. However, the product did not work. The USB cable did not work. Vendor sent a replacement and that did not work either."
4,works great once you figure out how to use it,"NICE PRODUCT HOWEVER, YOU HAVE TO BE A SELF LEARNER AND FIGURE OUT HOW TO USE THE FEATURES ON YOUR OWN. HOWEVER IT IT VERY HANDY AND A CONVENIENT WAY TO KEEP TRACK OF PHOTOS TAKEN ON YOUR CELL PHONE AS WELL AS YOUR ADDRESS BOOK"
3,My phone was too new..,"Software works like a champ.That said, the unpowered mini-usb cable does not work with the new Razr v3xx, it requires a powered cable which i had from a camera.But a legit copy of the software was well worth the $5 paid."
4,I wish I had bought a motorola phone,I had a little trouble getting the upgrade that would work with my daughter's V195 but they came thru and put the upgrade on their web site and the program seems to do what it says. I've only given my daughter her favorite mp3s as ringtones and I haven't tried the other features but that feature alone is very cool and will save buying imitation ringtones.
2,Cant do much with it.,"You can edit your phone #'s and a few other things. But I wanted to do more like download ringtones, pics and wall papers from Motorola. No can do. If you want to enter you phone #'s with the computer key board, you can. But thats about it. Thank the lord I only paid 12 dollars for it, thats all its worth, to me anyway."
3,It's okay for what it is.,When I first purchased this product I thought it was great but since I have been messing around with it I have found it does have a few glitches that can screw up a rin tone when your trying to transfer but other than that it's all right.
2,An very unenlightening list,"Bloody Mary's executions of Protestants created a deep seated hatred of Catholics in the English soul and cast a long shadow. Understanding what happened in this period of English history is essential to understanding the next 400 years. However this book is primarily a distillation of John Foxe's Book of Martyrs, and provides little more than a list of martyrs with only a limited attempt at understanding the forces at play."
4,Good book,"Ridley details the martyrdom of 283 people whom were mostly burned at the stake during Mary Tudor's reign as Queen of England. Over a period of 45 months she and her minions burned these so called heretics for things like refusing to attend mass, refusing to agree that Christ's real presence was in the elements and refusing allegiance to the Pope. More people were burned and martyred during her short reign that in the previous 150 years in England. It was a sad time in history."
2,Fell apart very easily,"This cannot be played with. It looks nice, but as soon as you touch it, pieces fall off. I eventually had to use model plastic cemet to hold this toy together."
2,A story of alcoholism,"I read this book with great interest as my husband is also a Vietnam vet with PTSD. While Alicia Boyd's husband is certainly a victim of PTSD, he is primarily an alcoholic. I was saddened as I read the account of their life together and her husband's descent into the depths of alcoholism. I found little hope in this book and finished feeling that she needs to go to more alanon meetings and stop enabling his destructive behavior. I hope he finds recovery from the devastating disease of alcoholism."
5,Holy War,"This is indeed a book you read in one sitting. You want so much to see the cliche's that your heart has grown to hope for. Not so in this book. It hits you like the private chill you get when a loved one opens their heart over a cup of coffee across your kitchen table. You know these people, you see them in the supermarket, at school functions with your kids and over the back fence mowing. You presume they have problems like everyone. You're wrong, and even as the story unfolds you're not sure you can handle the ride. You thought you'd buried Vietnam too when the terrible truth is the people we sent to fight it are fighting it still. I give this book 5 stars for Valor. The author isn't Tolstoy. She's still at War, she has no Peace. Didn't support our veterans the first time? Read this book and pray. Support them now."
4,nice parfum spray,"Nice, very fragrant. Really soft fragrance. I really like this and would recommend it."
2,A Picture is Worth 1000 Words,"If you are looking for a ""picture"" book of American Arts & Crafts Textiles and designs, this will be a big disappointment. Although there are a few excellent photographs, most are so small that it is almost impossible to clearly see details."
3,Missing Info,"Compared to several other ""Top 10"" guides that I have used, I found that some information I needed was missing. For example, the hotels that were recommended were either low end or high end. There was no mention for middle-priced hotels. Also, I wanted some information on how to obtain reservations for a few of the museums , but could not find any.In addition, some of the ""Top 10"" guides give helpful information for those visitors who only have one day to see as many sights as possible (ie, what to see & do in one or two days)----this one did not."
4,Perfect size guide book,This little guide book is the perfect size to carry on a trip. It has two great removable maps - one for the metro and one of the city.
3,"Excellent maps, but a little too brief for us","I love the Eyewitness travel guides, and probably have about eight or nine of these from past trips. I had forgotten, though, just how brief the Top 10 guides are. While this has excellent maps (including a great one for Barcelona's metro system) and is a great size, it didn't give us quite enough info to plan our upcoming trip; it provides a good overview, but the emphasis really is on *overview*. I went ahead and ordered the regular Eyewitness Guide, which I'm hoping will have more information for us."
5,To 10 Barcelona,"We have traveled extensively through the years. After doing our research for a trip, we like to take a guide book along with us. The Eyewitness Top 10 Travel Guide series is small, compact, detailed and comprehensive with terrific maps. It is the only guide book you need to take."
5,Very handy travel guide for Barcelona,This was my first Eyewitness top ten guide and I liked the size and utility of it. My usual go-to-guides were Lonely Planey and Rick Steves but I'm definitely going to be picking these up instead of short visits. For longer and more in-depth travels the larger guides are a better option though these top 10 guides are probably still a nice add-on even then.Recommended!
4,Tour guide booklet review on top 10 barcelona,"The book is a very good starting point for someone who has never been there. But, I wish that the included map of the city is a bit larger."
3,Lettering on maps too small,"Handy book, except the words on the maps are so tiny I need a magnifying glass to read it. However the Metro & RENFE map that is included on the back cover was very very helpful. The metro lines were colored coded as it is on the actual metro lines so locating and following the lines and stations were much easier.Also, even if many say English is spoken in Barcelona, it's best to know some Spanish in case you have to ask a native. I ran into quite a few situations where the residents just didn't speak any English at all."
3,"Love the books, not the Kindle Version","The only reason I purchased the kindle version was because I was afraid my print version was not going to arrive on time for my trip. Luckily my print version arrived right before I left. The kindle verion is not users friendly, it was hard to go between the different sections. I highly recommend these these books, just stick to the print version."
1,Disappointed,The type is so small and hard to read that the book should come with a flashlight. Contents are well organized and useful -- if one can get past the illegibility.
2,Not Impressed,"Prior to a visit to Barcelona, I wouldn't waste your time or money on this book. Not enough hotel or restaurant info for me. If you like maps, you'll like this book. Fodor's guide is much better."
5,excellent health book,"This was my health textbook from college and I misplaced my copy after college. It is a great basic book on many areas of health education. If you are looking for a book to teach out of or just increase your knowledge of basic health, this is a great book!"
3,Good story and an easy read,"The film ""Total Recall"" is actually one of the more thought-provoking films of the 1990s, one whose intelligence was largely ignored by the public because it starred Arnold Schwarzenegger.The fact is, despite all its explosions, it is no less complex at its core than Vanilla Sky or Memento....The Piers Anthony novel is well-written and quickly paced, but I got the impression that they commissioned Anthony to churn out a novelized version of the screenplay to coincide with the film's release. It's certainly a decent read, but if you didn't like the movie, you probably won't love the book."
3,Don't ignore the book just because of the movie...,"The book by Anthony Pier is different from the movie, the first half is relatively the same, but the second half seems almost like a different thing. The ending, although the outcome is the same, is executed differently. The ending is actually explained with some intelligence too, and entire sub-plots are in the book.The short story by Philip K. Dick, ""We'll remember it for you wholesale"" was the inspiration for this book.A good entertaining read, although it's hard to read the book without imagining Arnold Schwarzeneggar's blazing Austrian accent speaking the dialogue.3 1/2 mars...er....stars."
1,An absurd concept,"This device could be a dream for live recording... except it's absolutely impossible to record anything with the build-in microphes without hearing the noise of your fingers moving the volume control, the track dividing button, the lights switch, etc. Name it, you'll hear it. So forget the PCM D1 or be ready to pay for an extra microphone. At that price, it doesn't worth it."
5,Great for Catholics contemplating divorce,"This is a great book for Catholics who are caught up in the old ways of not being able to get divorced. The author really lines it out for you. Even if you are not getting/contemplating divorce, it explains just what a marriage should be.I thought it would be great for Catholics and non-Catholics as well."
5,"Fantastic, Scholarly Work","I had always rejected the post-trib position due to the mistaken conntection between ""tribulation"" and ""wrath"", which people of pre-trib persuasion hold to be equivalent. Pastor Rasmussen's book shows clearly from the Bible that the rapture is indeed post-tribulation and pre-wrath, that tribulation is suffered by the saints at the hands of the world whereas wrath is suffered by the world at the hands of God.It's too bad that amazon.com doesn't carry this book; if you want a copy I'd suggest contacting Faith Baptist Church directly, they have copies of the book. http://www.faithbaptist.org"
4,"Fresh ""Air""","Cecil Taylor'sNew York City R&B;is one of my favorite avant-garde jazz albums of the early 60s, but alas C.T. albums are often hard to digest so it took me awhile to stomach buying the three other Candid discs of outtakes from these sessions (it helped that I found them on the dollar menu in the Marketplace). ""Air"" gives us three alternate takes of the title track (Shepp apparently had lots of problems with this one -- the last version is take 24!), and one of ""Port of Call,"" both of which originally appeared onThe World of Cecil Taylor. We also get two accounts of ""Number One"" to lead things off. For many this ""Air"" will be hard to breathe, but I find it quite refreshing."
3,Cluny's Peter the Venerable Abbot 1142 A.D.,"""Peter the Venerable and Islam"" by James Kritzeck; Princeton University Press, (1964), 301 pgs. (from a seller's review): ""For more than four centuries the principal source of informed Christian European knowledge of Islam stemmed from a project sponsored by Peter the Venerable, the ninth abbot of Cluny, in 1142. The project . . . consisted of the preparation of Latin translations of five Arabic works, among them the first translation of the Koran in a Western language. . . . The resulting collection, known as the Toledan Collection, was eventually printed in 1543 with an introduction by Martin Luther. . . . Many new facts concerning [the] project have only recently come to light. James Kritzeck has collected . . . the available material . . . in an informative study that spans the fields of Islamic studies, monasticism, medieval cultural history, and comparative religion."""
4,Fun In the Sun Tex-Mex Style,"I am a casual Paul Young fan and bought this album out of interest as there has been much written about this particular project. Started as a group of old pals having fun in small bars and escalated into something much more. This is not a Paul Young album, he is just one one 7 merrymen (who are all serious musicians), sharing vocals and playing guitar. From tigh-slapping, taquilla-swilling highs to sultry sunset ballads, this album is all about fun and living. Stand-out tracks are 'My,My,My,My', 'Shadows on the Rise', 'Raised on Margaritas' and 'Do We Really Want the Same Things'. It will make you smile whilst you envisage youself sitting under a cactus in the sun...this album is all about fun which is in short supply at present..Take time out and have some fun in the sun..it will be worth the roadtrip!"
1,Just didn't grab me,"Of course taste is subjective, but I think there is so much outstanding music, both old and new. This assortment was a disappointment."
3,Begninning sci-fi book for young readers,"Jack Jameson is turning ten soon, and all he wants for his birthday is a robot. His parents take him to ATKINS ROBOT Inc. where they design DANNY ONE, Jack's friend. Jack and Danny play together and even outsmart a robot-napper. The story is written in the voice of Jack. I think that the book is intended for a male audience. Even though the boys couldn't share the same experiences, like eating and receiving a battery charge, they could climb trees and go fishing together. Mr. Jameson and Jack are round characters, changing from the beginning to the end of the book. This book is science-fiction because it takes place in the future. There are Read/Screens (TVs), solar cars, and best of all, robots. ""My Robot Buddy"" would be a good book for self-selected reading. I would offer this book to a student who has an early interest in sci-fi or to a student who likes robots."
1,"Good idea, appalling result","Ms. Shaputis apparently assembled puff literature from 50 Chambers of Commerce around the country and repurposed it into a book. What you get is superficial, uncritical . . and wrong.The median house prices are years out of date. It is incorrect, for example, that half of the homes in Indianapolis or Bangor are less than $100,000, or that half the homes in Reno are less than $160,000 - figures contradicted by the National Association of Realtors quarterly reports on home sales.By the way, Bangor - in northern Maine - doesn't get 94 days of 90-degree weather reported in the book; more like 30."
2,Disappointing,"Overall found this to be a collection of general purpose advice (don't eat the yellow snow), and somewhat outdated generic information about 50 places. Having lived in one of the top picks for 5 years, I found the book's description of little value to someone trying to decide if it is a good place to live and work. Maybe I'm being unfair, but I was expecting something with detail on the order of the Places Rated Almanac series. There was no such detail. The CD ROM focus seemed to be on the 50 Gay-Friendly places. I'm no homophobe, but what the H#!! does Gay-Friendly have to do with families? So overall, very disappointing book. Check it out from a library before you buy."
3,Not as described.,"This is only a passage set. It is not an entry set. It works great as a passage set. It has no key and no turnbutton despite what the current description indicates. As a passage set it is ideal for a closet. Fine product, good price, just not what the description currently describes."
5,I have bought multiple copies,"I read this book many years ago when it was first published. It changed my view of history because it explains the seminal role of philosophy in history. Now I find myself giving copies away to friends who have a serious interest in the history of ideas, and who want to understand how current ideas are determining our future."
1,The only 'feverish' writing here is Peikoff's own,"The negative reviews here do not look 'feverish' to me - and if that remark is supposed to be an objective assessment by an actual Objectivist, it tells me something about Objectivism. (I wonder why it is that positive reviews of Objectivist books include so much silly sneering at other reviewers. Do you suppose there is a connection with Rand's 'philosophy'?) In fact Ayn Rand had a very great deal in common with both Nietzsche and Marx, facts which are apparently lost on the miseducated Peikoff and his even less educated readers. And if Objectivists think Rand's approach to 'rights' had much of anything in common with Locke's, they are not reading her very carefully. (Or perhaps it is Locke they have not read. Objectivists do not consult original sources very often, do they?) Perhaps Peikoff's book has 'struck a nerve' because he, like Rand before him, is incompetent and mistaken - or had Objectivists considered that possibility?"
1,contradictory,I don't understand how this guy can even exist: isn't the core assertion of Rand's thought that you should never be another's disciple?
1,A MINOR WORK EXEMPLIFYING THE HOLOCAUST,"Penetrates nowhere near the root of the Holocaust: namely, the philosophical ideas that led to it.The ""certain ideas"" that led Germany inevitably to Auschwitz are not addressed anywhere in this moronic volume, whose author in fact subscribes to every last one of them. Those ideas were, and are, nothing more than variations of the fundamental atheistic creed that human beings answer to no moral authority higher than their own ""nature."" The Founding Father of the Third Reich was the totalitarian Aristotle, who was worshipped by Rand and her sycophantic followers.The controversial aspect is how these ideas are being accepted right now, in America today.Warning: this creed has many guilty friends on the left and on the right, as can be seen in the truly bizarre responses below. But they don't have a leg to stand on (as can also be seen)!"
4,"Love the story, but not the size....","The story is wonderful and I was so excited to purchase my own copy to share with my class, HOWEVER this is the second time now that I've bought a used book and received an edition I did not expect. The first was a toddler board book, but the seller's listing mentioned nothing other than hardback edition. A toddler book is very hard to share with 25 children at circle. And now my copy of One Woolly Wombat was received yesterday and it's a minature version at 5""x6"" and not the full size 9""x12"". Again, hard to share something so tiny with the masses. These issues may seem trivial, but please be forwarned that what you expect may not be what you receive. I will certainly be asking questions before I make another purchase."
5,Lot's of heart,"Christina was an under icon in the nineties of Madrid. She was part of an cultural movement with Ray Loriga and many others artist from spain. In this CD she put her heart, not only in the lyrics, she put her sweet voice in some raw love stories. I really loved. Now, in this new century you can found some other singers who use her voice in a mix of sordid love song like the also spaniard Bebe and the mexican Julieta Venegas. Like Christina Rosenvinge, they are welcome in my women voice cd collection."
2,I am disappointed with this product.,"Its electronic capabilities are outdated: in 2009 we have moved way beyond Windows 95/3.1. The Product Description says ""...online help is available in every part of the program."" Where is it? The Help Facility speaks of System Upgrades. Where are they? The software uses an ancient version of Acrobat Reader. I sought in vain to obtain advice from the publisher regarding my problems. I now have software that is of little help to me, and will yet have to purchase ""The Celebration Hymnal: Songs and Hymns for Worship: Worship Resource Edition"" in order to obtain the helps and indices I needed in the first place."
1,Not relevant in today's world,"I saw that this was made for early Windows versions, but there was no detail that said it would not work on more recent systems. It does not work on Windows 7. Just make sure you can use this before you buy it. It probably will work on Win 3.1 and Win 95. Caveat emptor."
1,Nothing to it,This software was very disappointing. I am a musician and this is difficult to use and does not include the actual music for printing - just words.
4,A little disapointed in the product.,I didn't realize that the voices were still on the accompaniment part of the CD. Only the lead voice was eliminated. Was disapointed that the description did not tell me this. Wanted to use it with 3 of us singing.
4,Sing the hits of the Andrew's sisters Karaoke,I have searched for Karaoke versions of the Andrew's sisters songs and they have not impressed me.My girls and I sing together and were looking for a specific song and it's on this CD.These songs are the closest to the originals I have heard.I highly recommend this. Kelly
5,Anita Stansfeild is the best author,"This is one of the best books I've ever read. This author writes really good CLEAN novels, something that is hard to find now days. I highly recommend all of her books!"
5,by Love and Grace,I love to read Anita Stansfield! Her books are always great. She always has a subject that we can relate to in or times.
4,walking seattle,"If you're new to the city or even a longtimer who always wanted to explore the colorful districts of this town on the Sound, Walking Seattle by John Owen is your best guide by leaps and bounds. you won't just read about the sights and sounds of Seattle, but also its origins and beginnings, from the first day of commerce at the Pike Place Market. Most of the city's great walks are covered quite well--the Market, Ballard, the Arboretum, Alki, Diswcovery Park, the Locks. Fremont is the perfect foil for Owen's quirky brand of humor. All in all, Owen won't lead you off course"
4,great for pillow fights,"I bought this pillow with my social club's monthly Monday Night Pillow Fight in mind. Since I bought it I have secured my place as reigning champion, a title I believe I will keep for the foreseeable future. The pillow has a respectable weight to it, and the handle is as sturdy as could be, which frees up one hand to defend with and adds momentum to my swing. The stitching is also top-notch which means I can throw hay-makers all night long without having to worry about the integrity of my pillow. Thanks Hugger Mugger, for a tremendous product!"
4,A redefinition of nationalism?,"Ignatieff makes a clear difference between the ethnic and civic nationalisms. While praising the latter, the author explains the roots and the consequences of the politics of ethnicity and belonging. He rightly points out that ethnic nationalism is based on division, while civic nationalism is based on the union of different peoples (such as the case in the United States). But what Ignatieff fails to realize is that civic nationalism can be as dangerous, cruel and vicious as ethnic nationalism. Another weakness of the book is that its six examples, except Kurdistan, reflect conspicuously the purely European views and practices of nationalism. It is true that ""nationalism"" as a political ideology was developed by the German romantics, but the essence of nationalism has its roots since times immemorial. Finally, the book contains a couple of factual mistakes: Iranian Air Force does not have Mirages!"
2,"5 Stars for content, 2 stars for audio quality.","When you can actually hear people talking it is interesting. The problem is the audio quality is so horrible 75% of the time its not worth the effort. No narration, barely any setup to the material, like 10 seconds of presentation per casette side???However, rarely, when you are able to make out the words...its pretty amazing to hear these things.So 5 stars for content, nothing like actual proof, its on tape. 1 star for lack of narration/setup, and audio quality on everything but the phone conversations is really poor.The LBJ tapes I listened to were 10x better."
1,The Nixon Tapes,"If, like me, you have been avidly awaiting the production of the Nixon Watergate tapes, so you could hear this unique piece of history for yourself, you will be very sorely disappointed. As previous reviewers have said, the big problem is that you can hardly make any of it out - nor do you generally know who is even speaking at any given time.This volume is, sadly, a huge flop. Poor production values without an attempt to either clean up the tapes or help the listener in any other way (e.g. meaningful narration).The first company that can, in some way, clean up these old recordings and make them audible and clear will make a killing in the market! I would certainly be happy to pay a premium to hear them. Unfortunately, the recordings on this particular volume fall a long way short of this ideal and are, in truth, probably a waste of money."
1,Stopped working after 4 months,"phone just stopped working after 4 months.I love the phone, sounds quality, ease of use, except it just died for no apparent reason.I'm waiting to hear back from the seller and see what options I have.Super bummed right now."
5,The greatest female rapper of all time.,"This compilation trumps her previous ""Greatest Hits"" release but including a number of her early 12"" singles that didn't make it to her ""Bad Sister"" album in 1999. It's still missing a few key tracks, but it's her best compilation to date and a great introduction to Shante."
4,Roxanne Shante Best Of Cold Chillen,"The cd is hot Roxanne Shante was by far the hottest female mc back in the day. I think the cd is missing a few tracks like Loosey's Rap, Roxanne Revenge the Street version and this free style they use to play on wbls called Wash Ya Body. It was like an answer record to Doug's fresh La Di Da Di the cut was tight. I think who ever buys this will understand waht old school was all about hot lyrcs."
5,Absolutely brilliant,This is about as good as you can get. Unless Perlman re-records on Bu-ray I doubt if this can be improved upon.
2,I have to disagree with the other reviews...,"...I detected little sympathy between Barenboim and Perlman...in the Beethoven, in particular, they seemed practically antagonistic!...was Perlman even aware that there was an orchestra behind him?...and the manner in which Barenboim hammered at the orchestra relentlessly suggested little regard for anything coming from Perlman...the Brahms was a bit better only because it is less dependent on soloist/conductor interaction...but again Barenboim's aggressive conducting was annoying...overall sound quality is good...for comparison check out Szeryng's DVD with his recording from the 50's of Brahms -- the great performance overcomes the limits of the relatively primitive recording equipment...for Beethoven, check Grumiaux's version although nothing on DVD currently available fully satisfies."
3,Not bad ...,There's no nudity here. Lots of great looking models walking around in lingerie. Lots of implied nudity with a few brief slips here and there. Very sexy ladies.
1,Paid for it and never got to see it,Actually less than one star. Lets say no stars. Cannot warch even though paid for.All I get when I try to watch it is a box popping up saying: Retry or cancel. So I hav'nt seen this purchase
1,Sad,And sad is exactly what it is. A sad attempt to be better than the DCC. I think it's funny how some people have to go to lengths like this to try and get out of the DCC's shadow. The truth is I would much rather see the DCC's in lingerie than the Eacles cheerleaders because half of the girls on that team are not pretty but rather trashy.
5,Must reading if you have heart disease...,"If you have heart disease, or are at high risk for getting it, then this book is must reading for you. I found it quite by accident in a book store in New England, but it has changed my whole outlook on heart disease and my hope of returning to a normal life following a quadruple bypass operation in January of this year. In chapter after chapter you learn of ways to control, or even reverse, the progression of the disease. The chapter of Vitamins tells of the vital role of antioxidants, a role that is only now being confirmed and used by the established medical community. The chapter on IV EDTA Chelation therapy will astound you with it's implications. I have read it from cover to cover and find it totally fascinating. I highly recommend it to anyone who has an interest in this subject."
5,A splendid work of military history and the best on Crusade1,This work will be regarded as a classic. It is the best work to date on the First Crusade.
1,EVEN WORSE THAN THE FIRST,"If you liked the first volume in this series, two things are true. One, you're an idiot. Two, you'll love this volume even more, because the songs are more boring (hard to believe, but true) and the production even worse. Enjoy!"
1,Bob Dylan both ends of the rainbow,"Received the item quickly, not what I really expected. Too, much talking and not much Dylan."
2,American Frontiersmen,"Probably because it covers two men, this is twice as long as your typical cable TV biography. It's filled with cheesy reenactments. Even though they mention Native Americans often, no Native American is among the white male interviewees. This work may be good for men into Civil War recreation stuff. It could be good to get little boys that play ""cowboys & Indians"" into learning history. I'm not into old-timey stuff, but this work would be great for those who are."
1,lies. only 4 blades in product,"Instead of the advertised 5 pack, I was given a Contractor Valu-Pack, also by Norton, of 4 Masonry Cutting Blades."
5,I'm very happy with this channel knife,"My wife had a generic channel knife that I tried but it doesn't cut deep enough for a long garnish to hold together. I looked at a plastic handled channel knife (whose name began with an M - but that is all I remember of it)at a local cutlery store and while it looked deep enough it wasn't sharp at all and didn't appear to be worth it's ten dollar price. The ones I saw at the kitchen store were also of maginal quality and did not cut deep enough.This Victorinox is very sharp and makes a cut that is deep enough but not too deep. It looks great,feels great in the hand and should last forever. Even though it is expensive I recommend it highly. I also considered the WMF, which is the same pull style, but Amazon said it was one to two months for deleivery and nobody else had them either."
4,Visual learner type game!,This was introduced to me by a friend. Four adults played this game at a ski house in the evening. We had so much fun with it. It was one of the first games I have played with these people where I was a winner. I guess I am more a visual person which helped. There is strategy involved but it is a fairly easy game. I can see playing this with the whole family also.
5,review of doodle dice,"This was the one thing my nine year old granddaughter wanted for Christmas. It was very entertaining and fun to play because it could be enjoyed by her younger sister,her mother and I. It was challenging to all, but not complicated for the young. Most stores have not even heard of it, but it was well worth the price. Buying through amazon including shipping costs less then if I had bought at a store."
4,great visual game,"Great game for those visual learners. The whole family ahs enjoyed it, but especially good for teaching kids to look at the whole picture, and then figure out what is needed. Would be great for classrooms!"
5,Great game,This game seems to be a big hit with all ages. We have played this with our family ranging in age from 12 - 81. We have played with couples and an all women's group. It is so easy to learn and quick to play. There is enough strategy involved to appeal to even our more serious gamers.
5,Fun for all,This is a great game for families to play together or for kids to play on their own. We've played it with both kids & adults & we all had a fun time. Everyone gets involved with figuring out the dice & which design will work best. It' a great family activity involving kids as young as 5 but it still holds the attention of the teenagers. It's a great investment for family fun at a very reasonable price.
5,Our family loves Doodle Dice,I initially bought this product a couple of years ago for one of my nephews. Since then I have purchased the game for each of my sisters and brother's families. We have game night with holiday gatherings and everyone can play this game. It is fun for the younger ones (as young as 4) and challenging for older players (my mom plays it with the grandkids). It makes kids develop and use strategy and create the picture on the cards. The names of some of the pictures are so funny (Rub-A-Dub). I purchased this game for my husband's great nephew and it was a hit again.
4,Doodle Dice - Not just for kids,"I bought this game, without reading any reviews, because it had a good price point. I wound up loving it. It has great educational value for kids (Colors, Shapes, Languages, Spelling), but adults can enjoy just as well... the only thing that could make it better... water proof the cards so we can play by the pool."
4,Doodle Dice,My 6 year old got this for her birthday and everybody enjoys playing (including Mom). We've gotten two more sets to give as 6 year old birthday gifts.
2,Rather dull,Nothing to get excited about and rathering boring. One or two catchy tunes but that's it.
3,Sluggish tempo on the Serenade -- unforgivable,"Boulez ruins the Serenade with a ridiculously slow tempo for the first movement, somewhere around half-note = 80 whereas Schoenberg specified half-note = 100. With other composers, you might get away with that sort of nonsense, claiming that you slowed it down to ""bring out the interesting inner voices"" or whatever. But with Schoenberg you don't second guess. Yes, it goes VERY fast, but this is for a reason. Skip Boulez, try a CD where Robert Craft conducts. He respects the designated tempo and keeps it ALIVE!(The Five Pieces performance on this CD may be fine -- I don't know that work so well.)"
2,I guess I'm not as sophisticated as all of you...,"Depth? Genius? This stuff sounds like your watching an old Bugs Bunny cartoon. Its like the background sound effects when Yosemite Sam steps on a rake or Daffy does a double-take. Imagine being Ray Charles or Andrea Bocelli and ""watching"" old cartoons: it's the same experience. But in this case, I'd rather be Marlee Matlin."
1,Waste of time and money.,Great tool just a complete waste of time and money. U install tool before u pull timing chains at tdc to hold camshafts from turning while u pull heads. Problem is there are two bolts under holder u then have to remove holder to remove bolts to get the head off. So u have to put camshafts back in time anyway.
3,"Decent price, but they didn't last.","I still have the boxers (I bought four pairs), but two pairs have already developed holes, right below the crotch opening. I've had them less than two months, so that seems pretty ridiculous. That being said, despite their flimsy construction, they hang well and feel comfortable. Also, the seller I bought them from is great--do not confuse this products recommendation with the seller!"
2,They last as long as yesterday!,"I bought four pair of these. The price was reasonable but not a bargain. They fit well and were very comfortable, but they didn't last three months! By the end of a couple of months, they all started to tear in the crotch, and I have thrown all but one pair away. The last pair is about done as well. Save your money! Try another brand."
1,Excuse me I thought there would be some race cars?,"Too bad you can't rate a movie with ""zero"" stars...I bought this video for my son who really likes race cars. I thought it would show race cars up close, but I was wrong. During the first 15 or 20 minutes the video follows some old dude (retired racer - I""m not a Nascar expert so maybe this guy is someone famous?) as he takes his granddaughter to a race track to look at racer's trailers, buy a tee-shirt, dance on some tires, etc. You also get to look at some rims and tires and there are some goofy songs about tires, too. Eventually they go into a driver's trailer, who apparantly is the father of one of the kids in the movie, but he's asleep and they have to wake him up. At this point you really haven't seen any good car scenes. By now my patience was exhausted so we put in a movie about trains, and watched that. Overall, a disappointing movie and not recommended. In case you're wondering I threw it out - how do I get my money back?"
2,Useless but adorable!,"I probably should have looked at the publication date before buying this book. There's nothing wrong with the book for its time, but I've been working in the pet industry for years and fiddling with plants for a while, so most of the info seems outdated to me. Still, I'm glad that I purchased the book."
1,No onscreen graphics,"I returned this ""CDG"" for a full refund. Amazon has always been good to me in that respect. There are no onscreen graphics to guide the singer. In my opinion, this is NOT a Karaoke disc. It is more a practice disc for the ""Seasoned Professional"" because you don't have any clue when to start singing. The music is good and it does provide a ""Written song sheet"" to give you the words if you are ""Very Familiar"" with the songs provided. So, if you are the normal run of the mill karaoke singer, pass this one up. This particular group is hard to find and that sort of makes one feel desperate to buy just anything offered to get the one or two songs you're looking for. I only found one other out there and it's expensive in comparison to this one. I think it's because of licensing issues that we don't find more of Jay and the Americans."
2,NOT CD+G,"The editorial review says this is a CD+G, the label is Pocketsongs CDG, but this isn't a CD+G disc. It's backing tracks only. Pocketsongs DOES make CD+G versions of these songs but I have yet to find them all on one disc. Very disappointed, sent it back."
2,"Good moments, but sadly ho hum.","This record has some excellent moments showcasing the band's musical ability, but there are two serious problems. First, the sound quality is terrible. It sounds like an AUD tape, or worse, a SB patch that has been filtered through an AM radio! Whew. Very disappointing after the first few beats. Second, it's boring! Many extended jams see the band members in a groove that's so relaxed it sounds like they're on autopilot. I love this band and have seen them live, but this isn't representative. I'm desperately hoping the Brooklyn show (4/20!) will come out better."
5,Great writing series,This book has really helped my son develop better writing skills. It is very easy to understand and the process is broken down into easy to digest pieces so it isn't overwhelming. He also appreciates the humor of the author as someone else stated =)
4,Good Choice,"We haven't started the new school year yet, but I have looked through the book, and I find it to be very promising."
4,Where is this chat room?!?!?!,"After the first few pages, I wasn't sure I'd like this book. However, as I kept reading I realized I was in for a great ride. The book jumps back and forth between three chat rooms (one for most of the story, the other two have minor appearances) and basic text. The story is broken down into three parts, the first narrated by Alexa, the second by Omen, the third by both. Although the structure seems a little hard to follow at first, it is not.If you're into S&M;, you might enjoy this book (I wouldn't know). However, even if you're not into S&M;, this book is a good story about overcoming ones fears and learning to trust someone. It's a tantalizing (realistic or not, I don't know) peek into the S&M; community.Although 'Venus Online' is a tantalizing ride through cybersex and cyberspace, it is not a raunchy book by any means. It is tastefully done. I'm looking foward to finding and reading more books by Alison Tyler."
5,The best of the best,"This is the best book that covers DSP. The topics are gone over conceptually, not mathematically, so one gets a solid grasp of what really goes on. I read it after taking a couple of DSP classes, but I wish I had it BEFORE. Lyons' book can be used as a self-study, theoretical reference for class/research, or as a practical reference. If you MUST understand what goes on in DSP this is a MUST buy!"
4,Very good high-level coverage,"I found this book to be well written. It covers the technical subjects well without getting boring or too bogged down in math. As a result, I found it to be very helpful and I still refer to it.People looking for a good technical overview of DSP will love this book. If you have little to no mathmatical background, you may be turned off (DSP is a math intensive subject). If you're programing DSPs, this book may not give you enough detail but will still be useful.My only complaint is that the binding started to fall apart on my hard-back copy."
4,Absolutely Beautiful Music from Celtic Spain (Galicia),"If you like Celtic music, like Loreena McKennit, you should listen to Luar na Lubre. This music is beautiful and inspiring. Wonderful instrumentation and a singer with a beautiful voice. It is in Gallego and some Spanish, so do not expect it to have English wording so you can sing along to it. Nevertheless, it is a joy to listen to. Makes me want to learn Gallego."
4,Great value,"This unit is basically the Vista without the memory card, compass, and barometric altimeter. The last two I thought I could live without and the micro SD memory I thought I could shop for one later. The maps out of the box are decent for navigating the trail, but don't expect to do very well navigating roadways without the City maps. I found that if you're hiking in mountainous areas you tend to lose signal in the valleys and when you lose line-of-site with the satallites, ie. big mountain in the way. The battery life is really good - I toyed with this thing for days before the battery died on me. There are some good websites for downloading waypoints to natural land forms - water falls, caves, arches, etc. This is a good all around GPS for the price with the ability to upgrade some."
5,Excellent Value,"Very happy with unit, in my opinion the best value out there. upgraded from garmin etrex legend, night and day difference"
2,not user friendly,This item has great promise but using it is not transparent. Be prepared to shlog through lots of instructions that are not altogether clear.
4,"Nice price, lots of features",This is a nice handheld color unit with lots of great features for the price!
2,Tough cookie.. Great for outdoors..,"This handheld will accommodate pretty much everything you would expect and require from an outdoor gps handheld. Although the screen is a bit small, the bright lcd makes up for it. The unit itself is well built, and could take a beating I really didn't expect (dropped it a few times during MTB). Ergonomic design comes in handy. The unit fits securely on the palm of your hand, and works well if you only have one hand to spare. it's light enough to wear on a belt clip. Perfect use for outdoor hiking, MTB, or walking through the urban jungle (don't suggest using it as an automotive nav system; it's like your 90 year old grandma driving and reading street signs with her only good eye).I like the flexibility of the microsd card. The only reason why I'm giving this review 2 stars, as everyone and their mother would agree, the softwares are still too expensive!!"
5,Garmin etrex Venture Cx great for geocaching!,"When I ordered this product Amazon.com said it would take several weeks, because I got free shipping. I received it in two or three days! When it arrived my wife said, ""That is awfully small!"" I said I wanted it small, because it would be easier to carry. I am not disappointed. This is a powerful little GPSr and it has proven to be an excellent choice for geocaching. The battery life is great and the screen is crystal clear. I haven't even purchased the mircoSD card yet, but have been able to go geocaching with no problems. It takes me within 10 to 20 feet of each cache. What fun. By the way Amazon.com had the best price over anyone else including the GPS store, Ebay, TigerGPS, and Target.com. With the free shipping deal I saved a bunch of money."
1,Dead after two years,"I bought this unit from Amazon a little overtwo years ago. It is simply dead. Even afterthree battery changes, it will not turn on.I used this unit only about 50 hours, butmy warranty has expired. I have anolder, more simple Garmin that still works.Perhaps simpler and less features are sometimesbetter."
4,Versatile,"This is a great product for any outdoors enthusiast. You can use it on the road - trail - water, provided that you have the map$. The only negative is that the base map is very limited. In order to get the full potential you need to buy a MicroSD card and the maps to go along. You can easily spend more on the maps than what you paid for the unit."
5,Venture,"My first GPS and I have had no problems at all. Bought primarily for geocaching, but working well for car navigation as well. Able to get out caching right from the box. Still have more to learn, but has been a great first GPS."
4,ANYTHING FROM BEBEL I'LL BUY!!,"I'm a Bebel Gilberto fan. Her voice & style is truly awesome!! I bought this album on pre-sale, knowing that at least it'd be good...and it's very good indeed, although the original Tanto Tempo album is the ""masterpiece"", no doubt (it deserves more than five stars). The remixes are lively, most of them electronic-techno-oriented (of course), but do not surpass the original versions, with one exception: ""Bananeira"", which in my opinion improves on the original. Other remixes that stand appart from the lot are Mario Caldato's ""So Nice"" (I love this song)and Faze Action's ""Close your Eyes"", because they tend to ""capture"" the brazilian flavor and do not differ too much from the originals. In the totally electronic-techno-oriented trend, Peter Kruder's ""Tanto Tempo"" is the best. If you are a Bebel fan, this one must be in your collection. We're waiting for the follow-up to ""Tanto Tempo""!"
2,Sgt. Peppers vol. Dui?,"Look, as music goes, variations on a theme is part of any genre. This album, however, yells out ""leave well enough alone."" A remix of Sgt.Peppers LHCB might thrill a person born in 1986, but when you hear the real thing, you ask why change it? This album is a total waste of a truly great disc. Like Gipeto said to Pinocchio, ""stay wood!"""
1,Not able to give it zero stars,"I didn't think it could get worse, but it did. The first CD by Bebel is simply horrible. This one takes horrible to another level. It's usually indicative that an artist has few original ideas when the 2d CD is simply a rehash of the first one. This is even moreso when one forces this electronic noise onto a musical style like bossa nova which is beautiful on its own. Luckily, I didn't purchase these CDs, someone I know made the mistake of purchasing them.Even if one can somehow convince themselves that this is good music, one should know what a spoiled brat this Bebel is. I heard her rudely ask a radio DJ here in the SF BAy area when the interview was going to end and then to make a point to correct her Portuguese pronunciation. The DJ was obviously a fan, but this made no difference to the ""Tower of Bebel""."
5,Sexy Groove Mood Music,"Bebel has a beautiful voice, and I love the Brazilian Style - this remix album is like driving a convertible on the most perfect sunny day. My fave - August Day Song. Perfect for dancing, or for chilling on your garden patio with your favorite drink."
5,Bebel Gilberto - Tanto Tempo (Remixes),"Whereas Tanto Tempo was Bebel Gilberto's first foray into classic Brazilian jazz and pop, Tanto Tempo Remixes throws everything else her way. Thus, Rae and Christian's version of ""Bananeira"" goes funky, while the Truby Trio do a wonderful jazz-house version of ""Sem Contencao."" And if Chateau Flight takes ""August Day Song"" to the edges of electro, Peter Kruder brings ""Tanto Tempo"" all the way in. ""Alguem"" gets a Brazilian house treatment from the Ananda Project, replete with funk bass, while Da Lata works their downtempo magic on ""August Day Song."" King Britt also takes the BPMs down on his version of ""August Day Song,"" but 4 Hero applies their special breaks to ""Samba da Bencao."" The Chari Chari remix of ""Tanto Tempo"" is a bit lacking, but overall, Tanto Tempo Remixes is a great accompaniment to a great album."
3,Not that impressed,"I was pretty excited for this record. At the end of the day, there are a couple good songs, the rest are mediocre at best. They sound the same, try to do things they shouldn't, etc... I would not reccomend this record. The original album is better (much)."
2,Ho Hum,"Apart from one or two songs, I fail to see where the songs were remixed. Instead, it seems that the would-be-remixers simply superimposed some cheesy beats on these great songs. Bossa nova deserves to have some complex downbeats mixed into it, not just some syncopated, slowed down dance tracks. Maybe with practice it will work out. I'll stick to listening to the original."
2,Uninspired Collection.,I hate writing bad reviews so i am gonna finish this off concisely...ignore all the big names...they absolutely fail to live up to their expectations. I feel these remixes were done in such a way that nobody can say this was better than the original. Bebel Gilberto's voice is a jem and on this Cd it has been reduced to sparce vocal samples and augmented filler. This cd makes for great background listning thats all. Tanto Tempo unremixed should have been left that way...this cd is an insult.
3,"Good, but not unique!","This book is a ""How-To"" manual to build the Sassafras Canoes from CLC. If this is the canoe you want to build, then it is excellent and you should buy this book. If however, you want general information on building wooden canoes, don't bother. There is nothing unique in this book (for the generic canoe builder) that you cannot get from other books, or indeed by just browsing on the internet.The one thing that I did learn was that I do NOT want to build this design. So for the price of the book, it saved me from making an expensive mistake. This is not to suggest that there is anything wrong with either the design or CLC, just that the construction method and the look of the finished canoe are not to my personal taste."
1,Suitable as building guide? No!,"I started building the Sassafras 12 with the help of this book and regret to say that it was not a succes. After having spent a good 20 hours in measuring and cutting the planks I found that the two halves which formed each one plank, did not match. There simply was no way in positioning and bonding them into a smooth curve. I have build small boats before and have checked and rechecked every step, to no avail. E-mail contact with publisher and writer learned me that it was advised to use complete and updated full scale drawings rather than the book, although they denied the inaccuracies that I have found. For me, the book turned out to be worse than a waste of money. In the end I bought complete plans of a similar design with another design firm. Sorry to write such an unhappy review, but this is the way it is!Hans van Poelje"
1,Poor book,The writer maybe a good lawyer but the story telling is not his best way to make a living.
5,this is a good one,This book is totallly worth picking up. F Scott's short stories are some of the best ever written.
4,Promise Me forever,"Good book. I liked the story. I do agree Lily was a little annoying. She wasn't even willing to try and give Matt a chance, because she only looked at it as he wanted her money, and wasn't going to allow him to have her body too. So every time he tried to claim his husbandly rights she got into the annoying part. She also thought he was still seeing his mistress so that made her a little less annoying as to why she behaved as she did. Matt was mostly a great guy. He didn't believe in love so at least tried to be honest about how he saw the relationship going. But all in all I thought it was a great book."
2,Annoying heroine alert,"Connie Mason books are often unpredictable. The hero is not a bad sort- really. He wants the dowry that would come with the woman but he is also somewhat of a decent type. When given the chance to cheat, he does not take it. The heroine is very annoying. All of the back and forth she does with I want you, I don't want you, I want you, I don't want you just killed this book for me. I could not get past it. I am all for strong heroines who stand up for their rights but she got rather ridiculous. I am affraid Ms. Mason overwrought her on that. Otherwise this book would have scored better for me.I would not recommend purchasing it. Go to the local library and see if they have it. It really is not worth the monetary expense."
2,We're taking it back,"First off, I must say our outdoor pictures are really great. Surprisingly clear, lovely pictures. Indoors, however, we had to find the right distance from an object to take a pretty good picture. Too close and it wasn't focused very well and the flash was waaay too bright, too far and the picture was dark. (Not an easy task for a 5 year old.) We also don't like that the flash turns off when the camera is turned off. Our biggest issue though is the battery. It can only be charged through the computer (so much for taking it on vacation) and a 12 hour charge keeps it working for only 2-3 hours, at which point it needs another all day/night charge. We're taking it back. I agree with the previous posters...there should be a better ""real"" camera for young children!"
2,"Good at first, but...","I quickly found that its resolution was not spectacular and its flash is erratic, at best. The only way to get decent pictures is to depend on natural light, or else it'll be too bright or too dark. Most pictures end up being pixelated at even the highest resolution, and a few months after I started using it, I found I had to reset it each time I wanted to turn it on. Not very reliable, but maybe a good starter camera for someone else."
1,not a good value!!!!,"My daughter, 9, got this camera as a christmas gift. She was so excited and wanted to try it out right away. We followed the instructions and charged it through the USB port on the computer, not convenient. When we turned the camera on the Hello Kitty Logo came up and then the screen went black. The camera would not take pictures, the menue would not come up, and we could not turn the item off, it simple locked up. We have tried to reset the camera and every suggestion the company (Spectra) gave us. I have a verry disappointed little girl. This is a piece of JUNK! Do noy buy it!"
2,"looks okay, but defective","I got the silver color and, though it's pretty, one of the timers completely died quickly. I think the other is inaccurate. Not recommended."
3,Not the most accessible interpretation,"I had been listening to this recording of Pierrot for years and I still couldn't get into it. Then I realized it wasn't entirely my fault. This is a fine, well executed performance of a difficult piece. As well, it is played by some pretty big names (Barenboim, Zukermann, Harrell), but I couldn't shake the impression that there was more emphasis on the correct execution rather than the expression. This is thus vintage Boulez, before age began to mellow him a little. Erwartung is slightly better, though still rather cold. This may be the preferred choice for Schoenberg experts, but if you are looking for a way into his difficult style, I wouldn't recommend this recording."
2,response to weirdears,"this isn't a review (i had to select some stars). i think the reciter's name in the early lp recording of pierrot that he listened to in elementary school is ethel semser (that sounds like lotte lenya, doesn't it?). I have this lp..it's on the westminster label, and it sounds terrific on my old silvertone mono player from the late 40's."
2,An Embellishment of Truths,"I'm not disputing much of the stories that were told to Steve Dunleavy, (a gossip reporter at the NY Post at the time this book was written),he took much of what was told by ""the bodyguards"" and put a negative spin on them sensationalizing them, making Elvis seem like an obsessed crazed man! After all, gossip was Dunleavy's forte. I'm not saying that the book is inaccurate, but I am saying that this book does not represent the real ""Elvis Presely"". And the 3 bodyguards were not happy in the way the book was written. This book is an embellishment on the truth, distorting so to sell that many more books. The structure of the book is so fragmented and confusing...one minute you're in 1958 the next your in 1972! It's apparent that Dunleavy was used to writing columns for the Post. Bottomline is that Elvis was no different from anyone else and had problems as we all do. He hurt no one but himself and for all thats ever been said about this man, the good far outweighs the bad."
1,written by Murdoch's man,"Author Steve Dunleavy worked (and maybe still does) for News Limited boss Rupert Murdoch. The name of the game for Rupert has always been ""sensationalism"", afterall, it does sell newspapers and in this case books on the life of the King of Rock 'n' Roll, Elvis Presley.To cross-check some of the book's content, remembering Red and Sonny had been sacked by Vernon, read Elvis' original guitarist's autobiography 'That's Alright Elvis' by none other than the great Scotty Moore.For all of Elvis' great amassed wealth from such humble beginnings, it should be remembered that Moore received a measely $38,000 after 14 years with the King, and original bassist Bill Black didn't fair any better.There's no denying Presley was a gifted singer and performer, but somewhere along the line he got lost real bad. Pity, it would have been interesting to see/hear him still around today."
1,elvis what happened,"HAVE BEEN TRYING TO ORDER THIS BOOK TO BE ABLE TO REVIEW IT BUT FOR SOME REASON THERE IS NO ""ADD TO SHOPPING CART"" BUTTON ON MY SCREEN. WHAT AM I MISSING.ANGELA"
2,SO MUCH THEY DID NOT KNOW....,"It is interesting to read this book, because compared to the books out now aboutElvis - there was so much they did not even know!! Elvis must be rolling over in his grave at how much there is out there about him now. Elvis could have never kept the things he was doing quiet in today's world. I do hope they had his best interest at heart when they wrote this...I can see how they might feel it would shock him into straightening up...however, I wonder if it may not have caused his death...I still believe he committed suicide...that book came out just that week he died, he was just a day away from going on tour...it all seems too coincidental.But, this book is a complete waste of time compared to the books out today. I wanted it as a ""collector's item""."
5,The King Indeed,"I found this book totally captivating!!I read it in two days, loved every word...I was only eight when he died, but I recently visited Gracelandand became fascinated by his life.. and death.Thumbs up for the guys who wrote it... they definately had someinteresting insight to the king's life!!"
1,Dirty,"This is a dirty vengeful book that, I believe, caused Elvis to subsequently commit suicide within two weeks of its release.It is an example of the current dirty tabloids happening right now.Steve Dunleavy is a terrible man, who has publicly, in recent years, been considered a dirty trashy tabloid journalist. Dropped out of school at 15 years old."
1,Elvis What Happened?,After spending alot of time and being quite pricy for this used book it turned out to be one of the worst Elvis books I have ever read...I now understand why the estate didn't want this to stay in print it really is not very well written and it is really not a good read. I recommend to the Elvis fans to stay away from this one it really makes the King look like he was a nut case....thanks for the opportunity to finally put the curiosity to rest and I really think that there are alot better written books out there including Elvis and The Memphis Mafia which is a much better read....thanks again
5,A REAL EYE OPENER!!!!!,this book is a must read it open's your mind to the it cant happen to me's and let's you see how easy it is to make a life decision and how things that look so good on the outside aren't as pleasant inside... in this book (regina)a character was submited to the aids virus on her first sexual experience by her cousin's boyfriend ...after she went from town to town enfecting people with the aids virus with no remorse. After the deed was done she would then leave a poem behind to let her victim's know that they had just been subjected with this uncurable virus. this book i would give 5 star cause it's a real eye opener for some.
4,VectorWorks 10 VQG a must for the novice user,I always purchase Visual Quickstart Guides when I buy new software because generally they make the task of learning the product that much easier. This one is no exception. The guide that comes with the software is extremely difficult to understand because of the way it is written - they go into too much detail. VQG explains things in a way that a is simpler for a non-technical type person to understand. The only problem with this guide is that it is now out of date because VectorWorks has now released version 11.5 and obviously some of the things written in the guide no longer apply. I would still recommend it though.
5,All Boulez/Sony,"In Berg, WEbern , Schonberg very highly recommended.Yeah I realize there are english casting in some of the Schonberg choral/operas, the works were scored in german.I realize this .But somehow the english chorus'/solists (there are a few germans cast in some cds) but its the finest in terms of orch/conducting/soloist voice quality.This is based upon my extensive collections in Berg, Webern, Schonberg, on many other labels, german casting.I'll let this comment stand for all the Boulez/Sony releases.I am not refering to his Erato not DG releases.Schonberg was a supreme genius in all his scores, only his Pelleas he mentioned he did not care for the opening part.btw I have to say A music Fan May 5,1999, does have a point. there are a number of children playing with those voting buttons."
2,The Best of Eddie Rabbitt,"I Have the cassette. It is real good. I am looking for it in CD form. Also have another one of his that is Greatest Hits, Vol. 2. I just love listening to him. Another good artist that died to young."
3,Who Dismembered Carnival Performer Olga with a Hacksaw?,"""Easy Sue"" is a murder, whodunit novel. ""Sue"" is Andy's new girlfriend, but the novel is not really about Sue, it's about Andy trying to find out who killed and dismembered (with a hacksaw) Olga, his former girfriend. The murder takes place at a carnival, and the reader get a glimpse at a lot of unusual carnival performers as Andy blunders (stumbles) his way towards the identity of the murderer. I'm not sure if the novel provided enough clues to logically deduce the identity of the killer. (I guessed wrong, and felt the identity of the killer was arbitrary.) And then there's a fight scene at the end the novel that seemed completely comical/juvenile. However, the novel does contain many glimpses of future brillance, and for such a tender, young age, novelist ""John 'Jack' Nemec"" did an amazing job!"
2,Well written but hard to follow,"While this book is extremely well written, the story and characters are also extremely hard for me to follow. There are some great lines, but it was a struggle to finish the book and for me to actually figure out what the point of it was. Maybe the book was trying too hard to be unique. Too many stereotypical butch/femmes and ""earthy"" lesbians too."
3,Some fun to be found,"I enjoy this author's work so I got this one. There many characters to get to know. And their names are orginal Jeep and Chick are a couple. It had a wide range of ages for the characters. from their 20's to late 40's.There were parts of this book that made me laugh. Alot of self examination by the characters. Which I am sure if you are like me or them you have asked yourself the same questions.I liked this book ok. I don't think I would read it again. It was hard for me to get through it the first time. If you want a couple of laughs and wonder what the characters results of ""what do I do with my life?"" And ""do I have a purpose when I am this old?"" then you may enjoy this book"
5,All my gear fits!,"My computer (Toshiba Satellite) fits fine and the Canon 40D with EF-S 17-55 f/2.8 IS attached, EF 70-200 2.8 L IS and EF-S 10-22 packed with room for more.I am a Lowepro fan and purchased this bag over others based on that. It is larger than I expected but easily holds my computer and camera gear. Lowepro and other reviews say it meets carry-on size and that is what I am looking for. I'll get to test it in 2 weeks on a trip to Hawaii.There were several dealers offering this case for the same price. I went with MZ Photo as another review reported fast shipping. I ordered on 2/27/08 and got it on 3/6/08 on the west coast. Quite a bit slower than Amazon Prime 2 day delivery. Too bad this is not available directly from Amazon.com. I am pleased with the product and don't have any complaints about MZ Photo I just wish it would have gotten here faster."
5,The Quiet Man,I really enjoyed all the books in this series. They were enjoyable and so hard to put down. I couldn't wait for the next one to come out.Jordan was the quiet one the one who kept his emotions under control.I really hope the let her write Casey's story. When I got to the end of the book and they left it with a cliff hanger I was searching everywhere to see when Casey's story was coming. Don't disappoint us. Please let her finish the story!!!!!!!!!!!!
2,A necessary,"The product description fails to state that it only contains sample questions. I thought it was going to be like the general review book, which reviews and then some questions.For the price it is, I feel slightly disappointed. However, I would not know how else to prepare for the test since there is such a wide range of materials to be tested. You have no other choice, if you intend to take the ChemE afternoon session."
1,Misleading,Please do not be mislead into thinking it is as comprehensive as the FE Review Manual - this book contains ONLY problems and solutions - NO THEORY.I would not purchase this book if given the same opportunity.Thanks.
5,Shine Shine Shine,Love this product made all our holiday cookies sparkle..will buy again..shipped fast ...awesome product. large bag have enough left over for other holidays and baby / wedding showers!
5,Excellent knife,"While not a skilled carver or whittler (read: complete beginner), this was leaps and bounds better than carving with a pocket knife. It was suprisingly sharp right out of the package. I would recommend buying a strop or sharpening rig with this to keep up its edge."
1,Just Excerpts From Prior Books,"This book is copied directly from his prior stock market books. The examples and stories are identical; it should be re-titled as ""The Best of Wade"". I read the book hoping that Wade had something new to offer after his seminar company filed for Chapter 11, but it is the same old stuff.The end of this re-do book heavily promotes his new seminars, which seem the same as his old seminars (that were deemed consumer fraud by numerous state & federal governments.)Wade is creative, so I'll look at new things he comes out with - but this isn't one of them."
1,garbage musical quality!,"yes the gentleman from the states is perhaps right, the kids love this song.but DJ BOBO is absolutely a pretty bad artist and doesn't know so much how he could play guitar or piano on stage.... the question is does he can read notes at all???Commerz music is for kids! because the quality is low!"
2,a new low,"Prize Stories now has a new editor. I never thought I'd miss the old editors, but I do. This year's collection has reached a new low. There are almost no stories within this volume worth reading. Anthony Doerr's ""The Shell Collector"" is a phenomenal story. The other stories worth reading are by: Robyn Joy Leff, Marjorie Kemper, Tom Johnston, Tim O'Brien, and Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie. Other than that, I'd just skip this edition all together."
5,Valuable teaching resource,Great resource to use with students attempting to take anc pass the GED tests. It is comprehensive and timely for the students. Easily read; well organized and user friendly.
2,Too confusing! Wish it was better with the practice.,"Great for someone who doesn't have math issues, but for me. This was just as useless as high school text books in teaching me anything about math. Luckily, I got some tutoring and passed, but barely on the math part....Every other subject was exceptional!"
2,Broke after a week of usage.,"I inserted the replacement bulb and it was working great. I did a few shoots and a week later, it stopped working again. It's brand new!!! These bulbs are supposed to last forever."
5,this is the best album ever,this group is amazing. their songs encapsulate so many emotions. they can help you deal with the death of a loved one. they can pump you up. they can make you reflect. it's such beautiful music. this is a must-own. i think the world would be a better place if this music were more appreciated.
3,Symphonic audio explosions,"Heavenly symphonic explosions abound. Most comparisons describe Explosions In The Sky as the orchestral chamber rock of Godspeed You Black Emperor, yet I actually hear a more guitar-derived sound as opposed to strings and orchestral rock. The album has shades of 'Young Team' by Mogwai, leaning towards the gritty power of Trail Of Dead. Although the 'calm before the storm' blueprint is similar to GYBE, the tradeoff is less string/orchestral epics and more guitar explosiveness."
5,-,"If i had my way, there wouldnt be much to say about this album, or indeed much of tempory residence's (or constallation,krankys) output.This is emotive music, music which affects the listener so profoundly and personally that it should be put on a par above that of other experimental releases. Explosions in the sky dont set out to be clever or ""post-rock"". post rock is another term used to describe ""post genre"" in which a myriad of influences converge and ultimately create these grand and beautiful soundscapes,this cannot be contived. Im sure that the disspassionate pseudo critics in this world are looking for more in this trancendance and if thats the case, and thus the reason they listen to music, the void will never be satisfied. i havent spoke much about why this is so special because i cant, To me its like being analytical about what makes a beautiful woman beautiful.and in that i think i just have."
3,Pretty good... Not great.,"I'd definatly say Explosions in the Sky have things going for them, and they put together some great Post Rock. Fact and matter, as far as I am concerned, is that they are way too repetitive. The music they put has great, incredible riffs and some good builds, but it fails to deliver the unpredictable feel of incredible post rock. Maybe I just look down a bit on to this cd after listening to bands like Godspeed You Black Emperor! and Mogwai. I would highly reccomend both those bands before buying this cd."
2,mediocre instrumental rock,"After reading reviews of this album on here, I finally got my own copy and here is my verdict: This release is OK/mediocre, I find that it does drag a bit at times, and there aren't any moments on it that blow you out of the water like gybe! or mogwai do many times. There are some promising moments on the album like the 1st and 2nd tracks, but the rest of the album sounds a bit un-focused and bland. Maybe I need to see them live? who knows, but this CD isnt anything to get excited over."
4,Splendid,"there are references all over reviews of this album to mogwai, godspeed you black emperor!, my bloody valentine, etc...while Explosions do resemble these bands in the length of their songs and the expansive atmosphere they create, labeling them as another clone is an unfortunate dismissal. This is one of the few bands that in addition to having a cool name, have one that accurately describes the music. The songs burst into achingly beautiful sonic walls and then fade into blissful, dreamy, soft melodies. The most amazing part throughout is that the songs are always engaging; keeping hold of your attention, giving you only just enough time to gather yourself between the explosions. I gave it 4 stars not because it's really lacking, but because reviews around here are too often highly exaggerated. That said, this is a great album definitely worth checking out..."
3,a performance with some major problems,"As a general rule I'm a big fan of Boulez's recordings of modern works, but I have one major problem with this work. When a conductor has a work with a very large orchestra the conductor has to be particularly careful about making sure that the sounds stay distinct; otherwise the individual instruments are going to get lost in the large sound of the orchestra as a whole. The sound here sounds great at the softer moments of the work, but there are critical moments that are botched. For example, the sounds in the hunting song for male choruses are very uneven. And the finale for dawn is a total mess; the sounds disappear into one, loud blaring noise. I've heard recordings that have handled these forces much better."
3,Lacking in passion and virtuosity,"Relatively speaking, Boulez's 1975 Gurrelieder from London has second-rate forces. Except for the excellent chorus, we aren't hearing the full-blown virtuosity that this work demands, just as much as EleKtra or a major Mahler symphony. On the orchestral side this can be compensated for by Boulez's spot-on, incisive conducting, but even there one wonders how committed he felt towards the work's feverish romanticism. There's something too tentative going on. The real problem, however, is the vocal soloists. Jess Thomas makes for a bland Waldemar, and soprano Marita Napier simply hasn't enough voice for Tove, and she, too, tends to be bland.With at least three rivals whose performances are sweeping and exciting (Chailly on Decca, Ozawa on Philips, and Levine in a concert reading on Oehms), there's not much reason to seek this set out except for Boulez's insights, but even they aren't consistent or totally impressive."
5,my opinion,"The best album of mago de oz, heard the demos and see by yourself that this group is maybe the best spanish group ever."
5,A well loved dvd,"Nova: Separating TwinsI purchased this dvd for my granddaughter who believe it or not is only age 3. I bought it for her for a gift for her 4th birthday which is this week! She happened to walk in to my bedroom one evening while I was viewing this program on Nova.com. She was absolutely intrigued by the babies and the sight of the surgeries did not bother her at all, her only concern being the babies getting better. She now begs me to let her watch the video on my computer! Time she has a copy of this on dvd format for her own. I know she will love it! Strange but true.All of that being said, I too did enjoy this remarkable story!"
5,Helpful for getting the job you WANT!,"I saw this book on Regis and Kelly yesterday and went right out and bought it. I'm currently looking for a job, and this book was full of helpful insights and tips on how to get the job I want! This book gave me advice I didn't realize I was missing in the job search - now I'm armed with the important info for future interviews! A MUST for any woman hunting for a job out there!"
4,For the younger job hunter,"Written for the younger job-hunter, although certainly comprehensive enough to help everybody, Women for Hire would make a great gift for new grads and young professionals on the job hunt. The book includes loads of examples of cover letters, resumes, business cards, and even appropriate responses for interview questions."
2,Yawn...,"...ok if you're just starting out, nothing new if you've done any research or put any thought into your career."
4,The Joy of Painting!,"Goethe once said: ""People should talk less and draw more."" This irresistible book, in praise of painters and painting, comes from a ripe penmanship of a writer who knew both, how to write and how to live. One after another, these rich ideas and thoughts will strike a chord with anyone who ever got bitten by painterly itch."
3,Looks Cool!,"I bought this thinking it would be a great bar set! But, the only thing i use is the stirrer and Bottle opener. The reason being is I only make mixed drinks and the knife and little b pad are pretty much useless for me! The little shot glass thing is too small and needs to be used multiple times! But. all of the items are well made and it fits nicely in its stand."
4,Nice Bar Set,"We don't have a lot of space so this set is really good. It's compact, but has all the essentials. Oxo makes good stuff in general, and this bar set is no different. My only quibble is the jigger is kind of tough to see the different measures."
4,gift,gift for my husband (a 20+ year manhattan drinker) with the Hearty Boys new book...The Old Bar. Good read and recommends bar tools...the book and tools make a nice gift for any man's bar.
3,"Prada Women's MV633 Mini Nylon Handbag, Black",I'm surprise of the poor packaging. The Prada bag is in a plastics bag instead of cloth material. I was wondering if my Prada bag is original. Care to share?
1,You can't be serious.,This book is banal and its author's fame and fortune a result of nothing but her exotic surname.
1,Don't bother,Within 5 minutes of receiving this tool it was broken. It only took a few turns before one of the 2 feet snapped off rendering the tool useless. I wish there was a better option as this particular tool seems to be the most commonly found puller online. I saw the other bad reviews mixed in with the good so I took a gamble and it didn't pay off. Steer clear and look for something else.
4,Works well enough,"I had no luck using pliers and two different gear/battery terminal pullers on my car's front wiper arms (BMW M Coupe). This tool easily removed the driver's side arm, and with a little metal shim, popped the passenger's side wiper arm off as well. The round end can be a little slippery, but with a little effort, should do the job."
2,"Too small, but still works. Not good for a Mini Cooper.","This product is much smaller than is practical for windshield wiper removal on the vehicles I used it on. Most importantly, it's not a very good tool to use on Mini Coopers, especially the rear wiper blade, which requires the same tool due to the protruding rod holding the windshield washer fluid jet. For a Mini Cooper you want the exact same tool, but a longer version. This one is too short/small."
3,Works--I guess,"First attempt at use, the plastic knob twisted off. I was able to finish the job using pliers to turn the screw so it wasn't a total loss. I would think that in cases where a puller is actually necessary, the plastic knob will fail more often than not. I did use the knob for another low strength application so 100% of the tool is useful and using another tool to turn the screw worked well. The screw/puller frame unit is tough, plastic knob not the best design."
1,Broke with first time use,"The very first time I tried to pull the wiper off of my boat, the plastic knob on the bolt broke off as I was turning it. I then tried using a wrench in place of the knob and the bolt sheared in half. A truly cheaply made product and not worth buying."
3,Doesn't fit 2002 Jeep Liberty,"Bought one of these to remove wiper arms that were stuck to shaft. I was able to remove them with the tool but it does not fit properly. The slotted cutout section is to narrow to fit under the arm, so it barely catches on the corner."
1,Piece of junk,"First time using this tool it broke (3 different places). The end of the screw bent and then snapped off. I thought ""Hey, I can still use this since some of the shaft is still there."" Then both of the ""feet"" on the bottom snapped off. It is made from really cheap metal that can't withstand any pressure on it, which is the whole purpose of a puller."
1,Not very versatile,"Was hopeful that it would be useful for my BMW wiper arm removal, considering that its described as a puller. Not sure it would work with ANY wiper arm. The forked end is not wide enough to get around even the thinnest bolt! Sent it back immediately and went with the OTC 4611. That worked like a charm."
1,Inflexible Design Yields No Results,"I purchased one of these locally in order to remove the wiper arms off a '98 BMW. The neck of the tool isn't wide enough to center the tool on the threaded stud so it's very hard to apply torque. Futhermore, the knob provides little to no additional leverage to apply torque to the underside of the arms.Ultimately, I gave up on this tool and purchased theOTC 4611 Battery Terminal Pullerinstead. Unlike the 4676, the 4611 feels like a solid tool and got the job done with only a little hassle."
1,did not work on my car,"It did not work on my car Chevy Equinox 2007. Rear wiper blade base is too wide and puller cannot center on the bolt. I see that description is vague about what cars it works on so partially my fault hence would not return it, but essential it's junk for me. I got something like this http://www.amazon.com/Lisle-54150-Battery-Terminal-Puller/dp/B000I14RY6/ref=pd_bxgy_auto_img_b and it worked fine, it will work on all wiper blades regardless of the size."
1,Didn't work,I bought this to remove the wiper arms from a 2002 Dodge Caravan. It was to small to do the job. The device didn't open up far enough to go over the wiper arm. I threw it in the toolbox hoping that it may be used for something someday.
2,OK for lite jobs,"The windshield puller was exactly what I anticipated in using, but the threads on the screw stripped when I had to load it up. Probably would have worked fine for a lighter job."
3,"Unfortunately, a bit disappointing","Well, this album is a bit disappointing. I'm both a fan of old Queensryche, as well as ""Q2K,"" which I think is a great, underrated album. ""Tribe"" is most similar to ""Q2K,"" in that it doesn't sound like Queensryche's older material, but the songs just aren't as strong. Geoff Tate seems to be going through the motions on most tunes w/ his vocals & vocal lines being fairly uninspired. This certainly isn't a bad album, but it's just nothing spectacular either. ""Desert Dance"" is the best tune, so check that one out if you're interested in the disc. By the way, ex-guitarist Chris DeGarmo did cowrite half the songs, though he doesn't appear on the album. I really expected this record to be strong but its yet to appeal to me much."
4,Best album since Empire,"This is by far their best work since Empire. Down to a four piece, with Stone, and DeGarmo pitching in on a few tracks, this CD is much more in line with their older material. Geoff Tate demonstrates his varied rang and depth of emotion, typical of their older recordings. The chemistry of the original line up seems to have recaptured much of what was lost in their last few offerings."
2,Too Steeped in the Past,"Apparently, I am not able to move on from Queensryche's earlier works. And, I am probably still reeling from what I consider a disappointing solo effort from Geoff Tate. While there are some great riffs on this album (hence the fact that I actually gave it two stars), all of the songs seem a little incomplete. In Queensryche's earlier albums, the music took you to a certain high and then pushed you over the top. I do not get this same feeling on this album. I don't feel this album ever peaks or truly gets going at all. I am not looking for another ""Mindcrime"" or ""Empire"", but, I felt each album was a stepping stone in their style up until ""Promised Land"". I feel they have lost that signature dueling guitar wail and have gone into this weird transgression and have never truly taken that next step after ""Empire"". Still a great band, and I will still see them live. Just one man's opinion."
1,Unimpressive,"I listened to this CD with the hope that it would be better than their previous work. I was wrong. The entire album was rewritten material with the what sounded like a band mailing in the music. If you like Queensrhyche, listen to Empire and Operaton Mindcrime. Those are very well written albums and worth your money. This is not. Steer clear."
1,[weak],...THIS IS THE WORST CD THESE GUY HAVE EVER PUT OUT.THESE SONGS JUST DON`T GET IT.ALL OLD REHASHED [STUFF] SHOWS THAT THE ARE RUNNING OUT OF IDEAS.THIS IS NOT THE BAND THAT I FELL IN LOVE WITH DURING THE EMPIRE DAYS....
1,Tribe,This is an example of a band trying to experiment or evolve and taking it WAY too far. This album is simply boring and lackluster. The band simply seemed to run out of ideas and inspiration. It's an album of nothing but filler material start to finish. I'm glad I heard this before going out to buy it. This is the reason why downloading should be legal. You should be able to sample the goods before putting your money down. My faith in this once great band is going down the drain.
4,Queensryche are reborn.,"After going downhill in the late '90s, they find their way again. It brings the heavier sound back to Queensryche which after Empire was more melodic. Tribe brings a new sound to their music and it doesn't sound like anything they've done but they've also returned to their heavier progressive roots. Their worst days are in the past and they made a great comeback for the early '00s."
3,"Fresh and new, but not by no means another ""Operation:Mindcrime""!","Queensrche have returned with a fresh, new sound with their latest album, ""Tribe"". While this album cannot surpass any of the band's classics from the '80's, this album still conveys their sense of talent and versatility, which seems quite lacking on their past two releases. ""Tribe"" proves that progressive metal is not at a standstill. Queensrche blend harmonizing guitars with beautiful, heart-wrenching vocals. The album's title track, ""Tribe"", is certainly the most complex and experimental, which basically describes Queensrche as a band. ""The Art Of Life"" capture's the band's optimism as vocalist Geoff Tate talks through the verse in a very poetic manner. I would say this album will not be a dissapointment to fans as long as they realize that ""Tribe"" is unique in it's own way, and is not nearly as remarkable as their classic albums, such as ""Operation:Mindcrime"" or ""Empire""."
1,Is this the same band that put out Mindcrime?,"Without question their worst CD to date. Perhaps the most frustrating thing is that we had to wait 4 years for this, since their mediocre Q2K release in '99. I can understand getting mello with age, but save it for your solo projects. It's hard to imagine how much worse this CD would be if they didn't have DeGarmo helping out. Either put something out that sounds like Queensryche (instead of another weak Tate solo effort) or call it quits. You're tarnishing the memory the greatest metal album ever - aka Operation: Mindcrime."
5,This is very good indeed !,"I enjoy this album very much and it's a big improvement since the last album Q2k.This is a theme record with a strong message, Not as dark as Promised land and heavier than Empire. I found it refreshing with the absence of guitar solos. Go and buy the CD now !"
1,Quite disappointing,"After much anticipation Queensryche has released Tribe, their latest studio album.I found it to be pale in comparison the the classics of the past. (The Warning, Rage for order). I had been very hopeful of a masterpiece considering Chris Degarmo had returned to record this album. It seems the band is so focused on getting their message across lyrically, that they forgot about the music. There is not even one memorable track on the album, it is a whole disc full of soft, ballad like songs. I think the whole band should sit down and listen to Operation Mindcrime and remember that is possible to send a message while still composing some Amazing rock music."
3,Queensryche - On A Par With Their Last Two Releases,"For this album the band is down to a four piece with former member Chris Degarmo showing up in a part time role as a songwriter. Many fans hoped that the return of Degarmo in the writing department would move Queensryche back into quality territory, but for the most part this album is pretty much on a par with the last two releases. Like ""Here In The Now Frontier"" and ""Q2K"" before it, the album is not horrible, but there is also not a lot that really stands out either. The band seems to have moved into a more Nu Metal type of sound with very few guitar solos and mostly just heavy riffing. The band even flirts with rap on the truly dreadful ""Desert Dance"". There are not really any songs here that I call highlights, but when I put the album on I don't hate it either. The material just does not stick with me long after listening to it. I rate this right down the middle at 3 stars."
3,good and so/so at the same time,"to sum up tribe, I agree with one post, it seemed a little rushed, from the packaging to being only 41 minutes long. open is a good opener and losing myself is a catchy tune, all the others have moments of being a great song and a mediocre song at the same time. rythem of hope being one. the only song i really don't like is doin' fine, just doesn't work for me. the guys are still great live and i think that they have to find that energy in the studio that they put out live and a great album will come again. go to their website and listen to the live audio track of HOSTAGE, which is supposed to be on the upcoming OM2, it kicks ass in my opinion and gives hope of that great album."
4,"Better than the reviews, not mindcrime but good","This is a good cd from queensryche although it is not mindcrime or empire but it beats the heck out of q2k. The opening track is my favorite and the next 3 songs are also my favorites. All the tracks are good to very good. Tracl..I think 8 and 9 are my least favorite. It's not the classic they could have given 4 years to write the cd but it's still a solid effort. It puts me in mind of hear in the now frontier, promisedland, and a little something different. If your looking for a classic you'll be disapointed but if you want a solid rock cd then amybe this will add to your queensryche collection."
2,I've heard better,"Rated em low, because they are capable of so much more. I loved Mindcrime and Empire and still do, Tribe left me wanting. There are a few good tracks on here, and I really dont have any buyers remorse, but there is some godawful william shatnerish spoken word crap going on that kinda bugs me.I'm not bashing them because I'm living in the early 90's, I""m doing it because some of it just isnt good, my tastes have mellowed so I would have no problem accepting that...but I know what I dont like!Waste of $ ? NO, is it a must have? NO"
4,Musically Incredible,"Considering myself one of the biggest Queensryche fans on the planet, I am very happy with the newest release ""Tribe"". Musically, the material is incredible, Geoff Tate is incredible as usual, and the band sounds incredible. The percussion on this material is outstanding, Scott Rockenfield has outdone himself.My only problem with the material is lyrically the album is a bit preachy especially the song ""Blood"". One of the main reasons I like bands like Queensryche is because of intelligent song writing, but I'm getting to the point where I'm tired of rich musicians criticizing the country that gives them the freedom to do what they do. By no means is the entire CD like this, but there is some isolated songs that have this view.Overall, if you are a Queensryche fan or a fan of progressive rock in general it's worth the money."
4,old line-up welcome back,I have been a fan for many years and am happy to see and hear the line-up back together. As always the bands musicianship is flawless. I am happy they stay tried and true to their vision and did not try to sound like what is going on in music today. I hope they cont on this path and the next album will be even stronger.
4,Like it!,"Just got Tribe today. I have played it twice now and I'm amazed at how good this thing actually is. After their last album, Q2K, I thought this one was gonna be the same boring slow song one after another. I was wrong. There is a good mix on this record and a couple of the songs are weird again- I missed weird Queensryche! Tribe is just brilliant and so is The Art of Life. The album opens with....well Open....and it will get lots of radio play I forsee. I'm pleasantly surprised by this disc and recommend it to all QR fans."
4,Great album...it surprised me.,"Queensryche - my favorite rock band of all time. Personally, their last great CD was 1994s dark & moody ""Promised Land"". Since then they have released fairly mediocre albums both sonically & commercially.With ""Tribe"" they return to their roots of hard-edged riffs, awesome melodies, & great lyrics. All the songs are very well crafted, reminiscent of ""Empire"".Chris DeGarmo joined the rest of the band during the production of this CD & you can feel the difference. Don't believe me?? Listen to the ""The Art of Life"".Enjoy & turn it up!!! Make sure your receiver goes to 11 :)"
2,Disappointing!,"I was expecting Tribe to be a great comeback for Queensryche considering the fact that Q2k was a major let down. I heard Open and was hoping for greatness,but instead heard their lowpoint.The only reason to see this band live is to hear the old stuff.I believe sadly that Queensryche is incapable of making in more decent albums.This cd is sadly a waste of time."
3,On the upswing...,"While not nearly their best, ""Tribe"" is a significant improvement over the abysmal ""Q2K"" and the mediocre ""Hear in the Now Frontier."" Based on their last three albums, ""Promised Land"" marked the pinnacle of the band's creative output, though they continue to perform amazingly live (check out ""Live Evolution""). As much as I'd love to see another ""Operation Mindcrime,"" ""Empire,"" or ""Promised Land,"" I'm not sure the band has it in them anymore. I think fans will be satisfied with this disc, but not blown away. Unfortunately, I don't think newcomers will find much here to their liking."
2,Bitter Disappointment,"I loved Queensyche in the 80's and early 90's. Hell, I loved bits and pieces of thier last two CD's, even though they were clearly inferior to their catalog. When I saw Degarmo was back I rushed out and got this one, raced home with some good beer, sat back in my lazy boy away from the family and cranked it up.Talk about letdowns. I haven't listened to it since. I'm sure I'll give it a fair shake down the line, but right now, 5 months later I'm still waiting. If this is all Queensryche can do then its time to hang it up."
4,the art of music,"queensryche is back!!! after q2k without master degarmo we got this gift. queensryche are second to none and that what they are only with degarmo that he is part of the body that call queensryche. if tate is the heart of the bend degarmo is the head and mind.songs: the best songs are open and the art of life that remind me of one of the best record ever ,promised lend, this song is queensryche. great divide rhytem of hope and falling behind are also perfect songs. the only one i dont like is blood . after all great cd.and to mr' degarmo stay with the bend cause you are the art of music!!!!!!!!"
3,DeGarmo Returns... Sort Of,"Just because original guitarist Chris DeGarmo contributes to a few songs, most notably the Eastern tinged ""Desert Dance"" and the acoustic Zeppelin leanings of ""Falling Behind,"" don't expect a return to Operation Mindcrime territory anytime soon. While there may not be much new here from the band, they still manage their distinct combination of heavy guitars, ""Open"" w/Pink Floyd-like atmospherc touches, ""Rhythm Of Hope."" Geoff Tate's high pitched wail is in fine, if restrained, form. Most pre-Empire 'Ryche fans will be disappointed by the album's lack of heft, but post-Empire fans will more than likely view this as another song oriented triumph by a band that's hard to pigeonhole."
2,Won't win new fans,"I've been a fan since the EP. Queensryche started off as an interesting band, but by the time Empire came out, they lost it. Yes, I know that album was huge, but I didn't care for it. Rage For Order, The Warning and Operation Mindcrime really rock.Tribe just doesn't sound like a hungry band. Where are the songs that you want to hear over and over again? Orginal line-up or not, these guys sound like they are just treading water. The mix is so lousy that you can't make out Tate's vocals clearly. Buy only if you are a completist."
5,QUEENSRYCHE STILL RULES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I love this album, it's great. Not as good as their prime albums ""Operation,"" ""Empire"" and ""Promised Land"" of course but hey, everyone gets a little older. Anyway, these guys still have it and I still love them with all my heart. The songs here are very well put together and very enjoyable to listen to. I am so glad Queensryche has survived the supposed death of metal and returned to rock us with their killer riffs and melodic rhythms. The lyrics aren't too shabby either. Pick it up and listen to it for yourself. Enjoy!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Less than mediocre.,"I loved QR since the beggining and I went to their concerts. I don't expect any band to put out the same sound over and over again...change is good...but unfortunatelly there is nothing here that grabs me...on the previous albums, it was very difficult to find a song that I didn't like. I wish they would put a little more effort into making an album. Putting an album out just for the sake of it it's just lame."
1,Missing-Chris DeGarmo,"They say Chris Degarmo played on this record,but you might have to listen really hard to hear him.I feel sad they a once great band has lost its power.Geoff Tate and Michael Wilton are to good to stoop to this level.Maybe just maybe they should regroup with Chris Degarmo alone and start over.Chris DeGarmo was Queensryche.Without him, I just ask why?But back to the record Tribe,I can just say it wasn't as bad as QR2."
3,"3,5 stars","A lets say nice album. of course they are not like their best work (Operation Mindcrime) but ok you can listen this cd too. Its not something special , the songs here are a little average with the exceptio of Tribe which is a good song. A nice album for Queensryche fans and maybe some metal fans will like it."
2,Not satisfactory for what they're capable of:,"Once again, Queensryche is attempting to write a genre of music where in they have no business doing it. They are possibly the most talented band in the world, when they write what they're good at. This album is average for any band to write, muchless Queensryche. It has some good riffs and tunes, but where are the solos? Where are the guitar melodies? Where are Geoff's high vocals? I know it's not the 80's or 90's anymore, but I wish it were so Queensryche would be comfortable writing solid music!"
3,Pushing the envelope,"Hello fellow Queensryche fans! I think that all of us were spoiled from the get-go by this band. Everything from the first EP to Empire was so amazing that sooner or later they were going to have a hard time maintaining the expectations of greatness that they set for themself. This new album isn't Mindcrime, but what is? I think we've all been waiting for the sequel to Mindcrime and missing out on the great music that they've released lately. Hear in the Now Frontier had some great songs, as did Q2K, and if you like Queensryche's sound you'll definitely love Tribe. They have definitely succeeded in pushing the envelope and exploring new directions for their sound. I love this album and know that if given the opportunity-you will too."
1,Leather Repair Kit Sucks,"The Leather Repair Kit was the worst product I have ever purchased. The instructions are useless, the kit is only for very tiny tears or holes which it doesn't specify on the ad and I wasted $20 because I never even used it."
2,Very general,"This book has little explanation of the covered math, also it is very very general with little examples, so using it to solve any problems is very hard.If you are a math genius, maybe you can undestand it. But the only thing it does is listing the formulas, but actually not every one you need.I would rather recommend Advanced Engineering Mathematics by Michael Greenberg. Its old but its better."
4,Great Book!,Pro: Excellent textbook with lots of problems to solve and practice. Good idea to buy the student solution manual with this book as a reference.Con: examples given in the chapters are sometime complicated.
2,Not as good as I expected,"I am using this book for a graduate level engineering math class, and it was highly recommended by my advisor. I will admit we are only three chapters into the book, but so far the book is not helping me to understand the material the way I think a textbook should. The examples do not show step-by-step solutions and do little to emphasize the material, and I frequently find that I have to look other places for supplemental material."
1,"""Mathematics""","It is so advanced that no one is able to study mathematics using this book. It's just samling of formules, not all even. I wouldn't recommend to use it."
3,"Decent reference book, mediocre text book","GOOD:This book is useful if you need a fairly comprehensive reference book covering many mathematical topics in engineering.BAD:Most topics are treated too superficially to be useful as a primary learning text.STRANGE TARGET GROUP:If you could only have one math book after you've gone through all your undergraduate engineering courses, this might be a good pick. But that's a silly scenario. Instead, you'll probably be better off with four or five separate books that are focused on their subject.I don't regret purchasing this text, but I got it very cheap overseas... It's really not worth the current $132 price, in my opinion."
3,Not bad,"Very difficult problems, and somewhat difficult to follow at times, but what can you expect from mathematics of this level? Overall, the book was decent, but that could have done more to make it easier to read and use, like including practical examples, which the book lacks almost entirely."
1,The appliques could be done better by a child.,"Bought the book, very disappointed in the kindergarten project appearance of the techniques explained here."
5,Wonderful edition of a legendary piece!,"Gustav Mahler is one of the last truely great symphony writers. His orchestrations are vast and his use of tone shows his true mastery of composition. This edition is the perfect book for any music lover, especially Mahler fans. It is small enough to slip easily into a purse or jacket pocket for use in the concert hall or in a bookbag or backpack for school. It is ideal for the professional conductor and compsoer as well as the music fan who wishes to own a written copy of the greatest symphony ever written. Also, its wide margins are perfect for note taking or analysis. This is truely the perfect score for the music lover. I own about 5 and plan on adding to my collection very shortly. Other great Dover items include the miniature scores for Beethoven's 5th and 9th symphonies, which are among the standard literature for every major orchestra worldwide, and the miniature score of Mozart's powerful Requiem Mass in D minor."
4,Very good definitive edition,"As the others have said, the score is small enough to be convenient and large enough to read for the most part, although there are two or three pages where some staves are faded slightly. I just wish that there was a glossary of some sort or a translation of all of Mahler's orchestral markings."
1,YUK!,This book stinks. I kept on reading...thinking it would get better. NOT! All 3 stories are not separate. They are one continuous ton of drivel about some of the most self-absorbed rich idiots I have ever wasted my time reading about. This softcover was a discarded library book....now I know why it was discarded.There was only one interesting character and she was not fully developed. Really....it is a total waste of time. DO NOT BUY!
2,Product Didn't Work For Me - Return fees were 1/2 the Original cost,"I received the cabinet in the communicated timeframe, but it was not what I had hoped. The color of the oak was too light for the room and balance of the woodwork although the oak veneer facing was nice. However, the shelves, backer, and balance of the construction were thin pressed board in a monotone off-white color. It was very light weight and not the quality I expected. The real disappointment was the 15% restocking charge by Amazon supplier Tool King on top of a $50 UPS charge to return it after getting a return authorization. I was ultimately refunded less than half of what I paid after return fees. I should have bought local in this case."
2,Just OK,The quality of the camera is OK. I had to cut out the plastic covering over the lens to make the picture clearer. No good in dim light.
1,Did not even work!,It worked for about 10 minutes then completely broke. I am sending it back. Sucks!
4,Good things in small packages,Nice unit. Reasonable resolution for such an inexpensive and compact unit. Plugged it in and connected it to my vivotec streaming unit and was up and running in minutes.
1,Poor picture/low price,"Poor picture, even for a low priced camera. I also purchased Q-See night vision cameras, which had even worse picture. In full sunlight the picture is not bad, any light less than full direct sun is grainy and washed out. Bad experience with all Q-See cameras that I tried (although the Q-See capture cards worked well)."
3,picture is deceiving,"Love the glasses but they aren't really smoke as the name or picture would imply, these are really full blown dark sunglasses that I can't wear at work."
4,I use these for golf.,These glasses look and feel nice. I bought them to play golf and they do the trick. Sturdy and resistant.
4,no vents,"Love these glasses, but if you work in a hot area, they are so close fitting they will fog quite a bit. Great for on a bike though...."
3,"Good idea, not so good execution.","Carry case is a great idea. Practically, this product falls a bit short. The case gives you room for two smartridges (in theory) but the pockets are so tight that once one is in, the second is virtually impossible to get anything into. On the plus side, it's roomy enough to put additional loose smartridges in once the console is inside. The downside to that, though, is that the games fall out as soon as you open the case up for play. We now carry the case for the cords, headphones, etc, with the actual VSmile Pocket and the assorted smartridges in a separate cloth bag (IKEA's Minnen collection, $2.99). Works much better."
3,Games Don't Fit,"I bought this product for my son for Christmas so that he could put his V Smile Pocket and games in it when we travel. Everything is great except you can only fit maybe 2 games in 1 of the pockets, and they are hard to get in there. The 2nd pocket is too small to hold any games. You would think that since Vtech made this carrying case that they would accommodate for everything that goes along with the V Smile Pocket."
3,More Space,"I like the V Smile Carry Case for the reason of protection. It does protect the screen, but has very little room for accessories and games. The slots the games go in are very hard for my 5 year old to put the games in. There is no room at all for cords, batteries, etc."
5,Very Handy,My son got this for Christmas. It makes taking his pocket very easy but I was hoping for more room for games. If they aren't in the pockets of the case they fall out pretty easy. I would recommend it.
2,novelty,"I bought two of these for my kids pocket V.Smiles. When they arrived, the kids were very EXCITED. I wasn't so much. For the price, you get what you pay for but the sections to hold the cartrige, don't actually fit the cartidge on one side because the divider have been sewn in the wrong place. It only fits two games, we also have headphones, if you put in the cords for the TV or car charger, the head phones don't fit. After seeing these, I took one of the linch boxes and found that they are almost the same size but the lunch box fit the v.smile, all the gaes, headphones and car charger with room to spare. Now I'm wishing I'd got them lunchboxes!"
4,Great case for all the goodies!,"Great case with all the straps & pockets to fit all the stuff for the system...Makes one neat little package. My only issue is that it needs to fit more games, being that my little girl changes games all to frequently for the pocket that fits only 1 extra game. Still a must have for this system!"
5,V.Smile Pocket Assessory,"My 4 year old got this for Christmas and loves to play with it. The V.Smile Pocket is very durable and easy to use. I was not happy with the quality of the Carry Case because the stitches didn't hold good on the inside after he got all his stuff in there. Overall, we are happy with the V.Smile Pocket game system."
4,great for travel,"This case is just the right size for the v-smile and a few games. The only problem is that there is not enough space for games. There is a pocket for batteries, but it is not big enough for a game so it can't double as a game holder as well. But, it is perfect for taking a few games on the road."
1,Kindle version's tables unreadable,"The tables that are images are so small that nothing can be discerned. Tables that are text are formatted incorrectly such that there are no columns; each entry of the table appears on its own line.It might not be a problem for reading a novel, but for textbooks, it's unacceptable."
3,Spanking,"To those of you who think spanking is barbaric, look back a generation or two to parents and grandparents. What do you see? Compare them to people who were raised without spanking. Is there a difference? Do you see any of the following characteristics more in one group than the other? violence, anger, felt unloved or abused by parents, respect for others, kindness, compassion, etc. Just wondering. I'm 64. My friends and I received some spankings--some more than others. Most of us grew up happy, thinking our parents loved us and thinking our parents were great, except for the teen years. We are nonviolent people who respect and love other people. Perhaps, other means of reward and punishment would have been just as effective, but spanking did not make us violent or insecure. It could be abused alright, but any method of parenting can be abused. I'm not advocating spanking; I just thought some of the comments on spanking were wrong."
1,0 Stars,"Or how about negative stars. This book is dangerous. You can't even call this a philosophy of child rearing. Rather, it is a tantrum of it's own. Foolishness on paper."
1,actually...,"To the person who hits their 2 1/2 year old with a paint stirrer... wow! How unfortunate for your child. My daughter was strong-willed, and we got everything through to her loud & clear without any forms of physical punishment. She is very disciplined and a well-behaved child. People always comment on that. You said point to studies that spanking is detrimental, well there are over 100 that across the board state all the negative effect, and I advice you to read up on this. You'll be amazed that anyone would NOT do the homework about this that has kids, as it's so conclusive. Not one study has shown ANY benefit that cannot be achieved by non-physical ways. You also stated about the school shootings, well, you'll be interested to know the boy in Pennsylvania who went on a shooting rampage was paddled THE WEEK BEFORE! I'm willing to bet all those kids were, as violence begets violence."
1,More Child and Animal Cruelty,"Just click on ""Look Inside This Book"" under the picture of the cover and read page 14. Right there he reaffirms what all experts agree on. Beating dogs makes them violent. He describes one night where he beat his dog and the dog tried to bite back. This guy's a moron!Advocating beating your children is even more abhorrent. Studies show that beating your kids causes all sorts of problems for them later. But he doesn't believe in any of those! He just sees results! Sure beating your dog and child will make them submissive, but that's OK I suppose if it brings immediate results and you can rationalize your guilt by deluding yourself that you're being a ""good Christian""."
1,James Dobson is a sadist and a pervert,"Pinching a child's trapezius muscle? Hitting him or her with a belt or a stick hard enough for it to hurt? James Dobson should be put away.Raising children this way may make them obedient to their parents, but they will be prone to abuse others once they reach adulthood. Look at Adolf Hitler and Saddam Hussein.At best, children who are physically abused will grow up to practice BSDM.This book deserves no stars."
1,"Another Unsuccessful Plan for ""Loving""","It continues to amaze me that so many believe that cruelty and physical punishment are healthy techniques for correction. This is another tome based in hurting and punishment until control and submission are accomplished. The idea that such techniques are physically or psychologically healthy is very typical of gangs and other warmongering groups. And, to call this loving is so far removed from realty that it becomes of great concern. Too bad that Amazon doesn't have a zero (or less) rating. From a retired School Psychologist."
1,Don't buy this!,"If you want lovely, happy children, buy a parenting book that teaches love. If you want children scared of you, then get this one. Dobson is cruel to say that children are ""rambunctious, pugnacious, fat little fingers, little Goody-Two-Shoes, unruly tyrant, little tigers, Tony Tornado, sour, sullen, ill-tempered"", in which they are not. To also say that babies are tyrants from a young age and need beatings is horribly wrong."
5,The only good energy bar,"This is the only energy bar I've ever tried (I've tried plenty) that I don't have to be utterly bonking to ingest. It's tasty without being overly sweet. Clif bars, power bars, luna's are all way too sweet, but the honey roasted peanut mojo's are great."
3,A loving & creative Lola with one DISTURBING illustration!,"Only being familiar with this book and Norac's ""I Love You This Much"", Lola is a creative, loving hampster with a wonderfully infectious personality. I highly recommend the story for all parents and children to share. The ""Cuddle Island"" also provides a rainly afternoon activity for my own child and his playmates. UNFORTUNATELY, I was gravely DISTURBED upon seeing the illustration of the cartoon character near the beginning of the book. The character depicted in this illustration appears to be evil and holding a GUN. I'm sure Mr. Dubois could have drawn something else to show the lack of ""cuddle"" in his cartoon character. I find myself skipping the page when I get to it so my son does not see it. With the amount of tragedy surrounding guns in these times, it is a tragedy in itself to see a gun in the middle of a BEAUTIFULLY CREATIVE children's book. I would love to rate this book with 5+ stars, but find myself ethically unable."
4,Good Practice,"These books are helpful and a good way to study for boards. Many people do not know how to approach board review - with these books you can set yourself a goal of 50 or 100 questions per day. Answers include explanations so you're not forced to look up wrong answers and try to determine where got confused. Plus, the actual board exam questions are actually easier than these. A good tune-up!"
2,Out of date questions,"I passed boards without ever really using this book- I bought most of the Mosby's series as they were highly recommended by other students/recent grads and professors. Many of the questions/answers were out of date. The review questions are not similar to the format of boards questions, so it doesn't help you that way either. If you are just looking for a supplemental book of quick questions to test yourself on and you have the time for some extra study material, than these books will be alright for you. If not, there are far more valuable resources out there for you to spend your time and money on.Likes:Quick questionsCan do short study sessions between class/clinicsDislikes:Some questions have out of date informationNot in board question formatSome questions not relevant (would unlikely be on boards)Bottom line:There are better study resources out there. Use this only if you have time for a supplemental study aid."
5,Love the music,I bought this for myself because I like REO's music. I listen to it all the time. I have always liked REO's music.
5,Simply the best book of short stories I've ever read,"First, know that I've read more than a thousand short stories and I have an awful habit of skimming non-dialogue parts. That said, Scribner's Best of the Fiction Workshops 1997 is extraordinary -- and I read just about EVERY word. Really.Each story is powerful in its own right -- rich with detail and characters you ""know."" These are everyday people experiencing tragedy, loss, and just trying to get by. Several of the stories focus on people with disabilities (mental as well as physical), and many of the characters are trapped. Very '90s, but very realistic.After reading each story, I actually had to sit and rest for a while before going to the next one. In most short-story collections, you find one or two clunkers. Not so with this book! I'm on my second reading, and am liking it even more.If you like short stories, or if you write short stories, you must buy this book. You must."
1,UNLISTENABLE,"Both the charming Ravel one-act opera and the Rossini selections feature the wonderful Teresa Berganza in her absolute prime, but only the Rossini have been recorded well enough to be appreciated. I know that the Ravel is a superb performance because I was in the audience at one of the Chicago Lyric's run in l965. However, this recording is so distant as to border on the nonexistent. The Rossini excerpts are taken from complete recordings available on Opera d'oro."
4,New Firmware Available,"For those trying to make a decision whether or not to buy the H10, please note that the new firmware upgrade by iRiver has fixed many of the problems brought up by other reviewers. Synching with WMP10 is seamless and audio quality is very good (unless you're an audiophile). Overall, the quality and value of this player with its features is excellent. Also remember that the product is almost never as good as some who rave about the H10, and almost never as bad as those who warn consumers from buying it."
1,Notable American Women 1607-1950: A Biographical Dictionary,"The old saying about if it seems to be too good to be true holds true in this case. Three volumes for a little over $4.00? I only received the middle volume. Since there is another saying about fool me once, etc., I won't be ordering much, if anything, through the used book part of Amazon anymore."
3,didn't last,I thought by buying this boot made of rubber they would last but only lasted 4 months before they split up the sides i have coolant grease and oil on them daily
3,Good but disappointed.,"I am actually very disappointed with this tripod, it was actually my fault also i thought that it was a normal tripod and not a travel one, this tripod cost much more than some standing tripods and it is just a table tripod. I hardly ever use it since i want my camcorder to be high and not low areas. Hopefully i will buy a normal tripod soon."
2,I didn't know what to expect,"It kinda tastes like tuna and barbeque sauce. I don't like it much. I thought it would be chunks of fillets, but it looks like tuna. It doesn't look or taste like salmon. It's good as a salmon-salad sandwich."
1,really dislike this gadget,"When I first purchased this I thought it was reasonable for the price and amount of time I would be using it. Now that I've used it for a few months, I've come to dispise it. I find it has poor sound quality for both callers and myself, but the electronic beeps that indicated a call is ended, etc are painfully loud and clear. The ear insert doesn't fit my small ears and the assembly falls apart easily when you are trying to ajust the fit. I've had to pull the car over and fish around under the seats of my car several times to find the parts to reassemble it. The multi-function button is stiff and difficult to use. I'm already looking for a replacement."
4,"Ergonomics good, sound quality not good","We bought the Jabra BT125 and the more expensive Plantronics Discovery 610 about 6 months ago. The Jabra has better sound quality and volume for both listening and talking, but the Plantronics fits better and is more durable. It fits tightly in the ear canal and has a durable wire over the ear band that is comfortable. I find I have to keep fiddling with it to get a tight fit it my ear canal so I can hear well. The Jabra rides loosely on the ear and the ear band broke after several months of use. 5 new bands cost $7+$4 shipping = $11. I prefer the Jabra, and my wife prefers the Plantronics. If possible, try on the Jabra. If its looseness doesn't bother you, go with it because of the better sound quality and volume."
2,I used to have one...,"... until... wait a second... oh, yeah. That little broken charging pin. Had other problems too. Like not switching off after the other guy hangs up, you hear such a subtle static you don't notice at times, therefore dead very soon. Fixed by restart. Sometimes losing connection.Still, it was a gift from co-workers and was pretty useful while it was alive. Comfortable and stable even without the loop.I kinda miss it. But I'll be going stereo. And then I'll trash the corpse. And the useless charger."
3,Good buy,"This is not a bad product. Sometimes I catch static or interference, but I am happy with the price I paid for it."
4,Good for the price,"Picked this up for $30. Works well, especially since it has no noise canceling circuitry."
1,Company was not helpful,I asked this the company for assistance with a part that was missing from the product and they told me the product did not have that part. A friend of mine that i sent this product to found it online with the part.
1,Garbage,"This is garbage.Comes with an optional over-the-ear hook as well as small, medium and large gel earpiece attachments.Audio quality is great.Bluetooth version 1.2 features included are call answer, hang up, deny, redial, mute, volume up and down.I'm connected to a Treo 680 with no connectivity issues.The little pin where the power charger goes is not only extremely fragile, but even when it's not broke off it has trouble maintaining its connection. I've switched out to my third one in three months. It is for this reason alone that I recommend you stay away from this little gumball-machine quality headset."
5,Excellent,"This was an awesome project. I honestly didn't think that John P. Kee would be able to stay on top of the game, but he has fooled me once again. This project is dynamic. He has a variety of songs for everyone, young and old alike. It's a blessing..."
5,pleasure,I Listened To This Album and its one of the Hardest albums i've ever heard and i like Hardcore Rap. ...
4,Goat birth pads,"I use these to put under our mama goats when they give birth. They work well to give an absorbent, clean space for the kid to land on when it first comes out. Nice price, nice product."
5,Best,"I got these for my puppy then my negihbor gave me some that she had. I liked these more, they are harder for my puppy to destroy then the other ones and that is a big plus. One less thing to have to clean up."
2,Not so hot!,I am very frustrated trying to find a pad that actually works. I have 10 lb. dogs and when they use these (and 3 others)it goes right through them most times. I am currently in a wheelchair and really need a pad that works. I'm going to continue looking for a good one!
3,Splash everywhere!,I will not buy these pads again. Whenever my dog uses them there is splatter everywhere. They seem to absorb okay and I have not had a problem with leaking through the bottom.
4,Good for the price.,I think it is a good deal for the price. I use them to line the bottom of our Guinea Pigs cage. They are smaller than I originally thought. If I used it for puppies I would be concerned about the size. Seems to do the job for what I use it for. Good fast delivery!
4,Good for what it does,"First of all i come from a place where there aren't a whole lot of options on many things. Including pet products. The largest quantity of puppy pads where i am has 15 at the most. And they cost a few bucks less than this and are 75% smaller. These are nice and big. Not ultra absorbent, but they do the job. What they lack in absorbency they make up for in size. Nice puppy pad, we will continue to purchase them. Great value."
1,WORST PADS I'VE EVER USED,"DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THESE. THEY ARE THIN, DO NOT ABSORB, AND THE PEE GOES RIGHT THROUGH TO THE FLOOR. I ordered these pads based on rave reviews here on Amazon, and knew when I opened the box they were horrible. There's a top layer of some fuzzy paper, then a layer of nonabsorbent material about as thick [and effective] as a low-quality paper towel. I looked at the dates on the reviews, and have a theory. The best reviews are from about 4 years ago, then the recent reviews agreed with me that the pads are terrible. The vendor likely switched from really well-made pads to really USELESS pads. I've used many different types of pads for my little dogs, and these are absolutely the worst. Blue Ribbon pads are better [but even these are made by several manufacturers, so some are better than others], but Amazon doesn't carry them."
3,Neat & Dry,"We have 2 small dogs and have broken them to the pads. I am not sure about this product, maybe if I had purchased the trays to put them in it might be better. What I found was they have a tendency to feel damp on the bottom. This is not what you want in wee wee pads."
5,neat & dry dog pads with floor protection tray,"these pads are much more absorbant than the cheeper ones iv bought, id recomend these highly and am sticking with these."
3,not the best,this product is fair not very thick show urine stains very much good for the price however i will not buy this product again
5,"Absorbs Great, no Leaks - Needs to be a bit Bigger","Bought these for a pup who is still not able to hold his bladder all through my work day. He has been using whatever was available at Costco, and the headache of those was that moisture was leaking onto the floor under the pad by the time I was able to get home and change it (9 hour workdays). With these new pads (Iris Neat 'n Dry) there is NO leakage, which is great! They feel sturdier too. The only drawback is the size of the pads is smaller than I'd expected - I'd buy the larger pads next time (dog is a pittie mix who's 27 pounds)."
4,Good product,I really liked these puppy pads at the beginning but they turned out to be smaller than what I really needed. It was an excellent price I just needed a bigger size.
5,Great for me,Live in small home and have a small dog. Larger pads worked when she was a pup but she's adjusted to these well. These don't take up as much space in the bathroom and very absorbent.
5,BEST I HAVE EVER USED FOR MY DOGS,"Love these. I have 11 toy poodles and have used every brand of pad available for years. I bought the large tray by iris so wanted pads to fit. These do, perfectly. I also love the fact they are so large. The dogs have less ""misses"". They hold more urine and the odor does not seem to be bad so we can use them longer so not as expensive as I thought they would be. I love the tray. It keeps the pads from moving around. I am going to buy 3 more of the trays for other rooms as well."
3,OK for a puppy,"Just started using the pad for my new puppy. So far, so good. I don't think they will be thick enough for older dogs."
4,IRIS NS-50W 20 XL PADS,"BEST THERE IS FOR ANY SIZE DOG,SUPER STRONG,NO TEARS AND ABSORBENT, 1-XL PAD WOULD REPLACE AS MANY AS 4 OF REGULAR SIZE. ONLY PROBLEM IS AMAZON HAS GONE WAY UP IN PRICE FROM A EXCELLENT $11, TO THE EXTREMELY HIGH $16.99. BUY FROM WALMART.COM AND PICK-UP IN STORE FOR $14.ONE STAR DEDUCTION FOR PRICE."
3,Liquid runs off the pad,"I think these pads are just OK. They are a good size and not flimsy, but they are not super absorbent. I have a 2 year old Blue Lacy dog, approx. 30 lbs, and when she uses the pad the urine is not trapped. Liquid just spreads and runs off the edge of the pad. I think they were a good value, and because we use these pads outdoor on a patio it is fine, but overall they do not contain her pee within the pad without it running off the edge."
2,Ok but not great,"When my maltichon goes on these pads, the urine seeps right through to my hardwood floor. These pads do nothing to deodorize so after a 2 pees, I have to change the pad because the smell is so awful. Also the pads are not as big as Four Paws Wee Wee pads so I use 2 of these pads side by side to get the same area as one wee wee pad. I loved the price but ultimately that perk is offset by how often I change them and just the number of pads I go through on a daily basis compared to the Four Paws brand."
2,Puppy pad not absorbent,These puppy pads are not absorbent. Pools of urine are still sitting there a half hour later. Paper towels are hundreds of times more absorbent. The pads are good for puppy stools. The plastic backing does protect the floor.
2,Not absorbent enough!,I have a 17 pound King Charles and she circles before she uses the pads and they are too light weight and move too easily. also in the morning it is not absorbent enough to hold all of what she releases. I have used better brands.
5,Great puppy pads!,"I have had great success with this product! It is very good for training your new pup or for an indoor alternative for dogs left inside the home. When used with the companion plastic frame to hold the pad in place, it offers excellent protection for your floor and absorbs much better than the average generic brand. Also, the denser construction of the pad makes them less shredable to very young puppies who may view training pads as just another toy!"
3,better for puppies,these are better for training. Not as good for using as back-up for dogs that stay inside. They do tend to leak through.
3,Love these but disapointed this time,"I have always loved these puppy pads, used with the Puppy pad tray, I think they are just the best. They hold more and they are easy to clean up. They were on sale this time for more than usual, so I bought 200 of then. My sister wanted to try them so she took 100 of them, but this time they are actually a slight smaller and don't fit the tray as well as usual. I don't know if they are irregulars or what but I was disapointed this time. I have a new puppy now, and since they don't fit as well as they used to, the puppy finds it too tempting to tare them up."
1,Edges are not leak proof,The edges are not leak proof. I have to clean up the floor almost always because the urine runs over the edges. I cannot see any proof of fast absorption (other pee pads do a much better job). The advertised odor-blocking quality is just as lacking. I definitely do not recommend these training pads. There are much better pads out there.
4,Best I've tried by far!,"Every other pee pad I've tried I end up finding when I pick the up there is pee on my floor. With these it is not a problem & I don't have to change them as often (once or twice a day, instead of 4-8 times with the other pee pads). My one issue is that regular size is a little small & XL does not come in large quantities, but I think their pros FAR outweigh the cons. I may have to use more, but they last much longer between changings & my floors stay dry!"
5,Works good!,It works good like any other pad. You just need to train your dog to use it! a good potty spray helped us a lot!
4,R-100 Works well with the UGODOG Indoor Dog Potty,"My dogs manage to shred these well construsted pads when used alone AND are able to pull these out of the trays designed to hold pads like these in place--until I discovered the UGODOG Indoor Dog Potty which utilizes a grid that goes on top of these pads after they are laid with the BLUE SIDE OF THE PADS FACING UP in the bottom of the tray. The R-100 Neat & Dry Floor Protection & Training Pads measures 17.5"" x 23.5"" which makes it about 1"" short inside the UGODOG tray, so sometimes a small amount of urine will leak underneath the bottom of the pad creating a mess--but it is still a huge improvement from the daily shredding of pads and newspapers. If the Neat & Dry design team adds an inch, I will add a star, for this will truly be as the name implies--neat and dry!!!"
3,Pads are small,"I've been using Hartz training pads for years, but decided to try these Neat N Dry pads since it got such good reviews. These pads are much smaller then regular pads. Although the quality is great (edges all sealed), they are simply too small for my Pekingnese."
3,Iris Neat 'n Dry,The Neat 'n Dry pads are okay but they were too small and had touse three at a time for my min pin.
4,These pads work great,I have a small (6 lb.) dog that sometimes needs to use pads. These are very absorbent and do everything I wanted. teh lower price concerned me but I have been pleasantly surprised.
3,Good product,"I usually buy another brand because of the larger size offered for the best buck, however they were out. SO I decided to try out the IRIS Neat n Dry pads. They worked fine, for the size they came in. However I still prefer the larger size of the other brand, because I use less."
3,o.k. quality,quality is o.k. but can purchase at my local meijer's one with better absorbency at a fraction of the cost.
1,Horrible for Urine,We purchased this item for our boxer puppy. The very first time he used them the urine just ran off the sideof them. It doesn't absorb anything. I wouldn't recommend this item to anyone.
5,Pads,good pads. do absorb a lot very happy with this purchase. good packaging. bag tears open at top. thank oy
1,new pup owner,"STAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY AWAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY!!!! No for real. Don't buy these. They are the smallest of all I have tried. And they are not as absorbent as they claim either. I've been testing pads on my IPFreely puppy. Right now, Natures miracle advanced ultra absorbent seems to be doing the trick. Don't bother with the arm n hammer ones either, you might as well use news paper! Good Luck."
2,Price gouging,"This was a decent item for the price. It was always around $25 for a pack of 100.When I was about to buy the item today, the price was $42 for the same pack of 100.This kind of price gouging needs to be stopped."
5,These worked great for us,"We have 2 small dogs that are paper-trained to go in their own laundry room area in the house, when harsh weather makes it difficult to get them out. We had previously purchased the Iris large paper tray, which we love, as it is portable (fold-over) and easy to clean. So we bought these paper pads to go inside. They are thin yet absorbent and fit perfectly in the tray. In fact, I suppose if someone wants to use them without the tray, they would work as well because they lay flat and do appear to hold the fluid well, wich reasonable changing out of course. I would recommend both the tray and these pads."
1,Toilet paper on the floor would do better,"I've tried many training pads with our house trained doxie and these are horrid, they leave her box soaked even when doubled up. Very disappointed that I wasted good money on these since they're going in the garbage!"
3,So So,My dog would use these to pee on...then shred them to pieces. There is a powder like substance inside the pads that gets everywhere! Plus i'm not sure how good that was for my dog to have in his mouth. On to a different training method...
5,Greatest Wee-Wee Pads,"These are by far the greatest 'wee-wee' pads that we have ever purchased for our puppy. They are super absorbant, even around the edges of the pad. Another reason why we recommend these pads is because of the value you get. We purchased from PetCo their name brand pads and it was $40 for only a 50 count and you can spend that much on a 200 count of the Iris Neat 'n Dry. And you would have thought that for that price, the PetCo brand would have worked; absolutely wrong. They leaked everywhere. We are telling all our friends with puppies/dogs to get Iris Neat 'n Dry for their homes! :)"
2,Not satisfied,"These aren't the worst pee pads I've used with my pet, but they aren't the best, either. They didn't hold a regular amount of pee, and stayed wet on top instead of wicking. They shredded pretty easily, too, and caused a mess."
2,torn up,I purchased this product because it was specifically stated that product was untearable. My dog ripped this pad to shreds and I have not been able to use them and will not purchase them again.
1,Sucks!!!,"Every pad I have purchased has been a complete square. So when I see regular, that is what I expected. Not a rectangle, of 17 x 21. This fits in none of my pad holders nor completly covers my dog's kennel. He sees the tape holding it down and its like asking him to scratch/nibble at it. In addition, the are thin and not very absorbant. There was leakage in the areas that stayed attached. Wish I could get my money pack but package is open and I am stuck with 97 more of these!!!"
3,Sizes doesn't match with Tray,It doesn't fit the Iris FT-500 Small Floor Protection Tray I bought at the same time.
4,4.5 Stars,"I have 2 senior cats that have to be confined (they get dementia too) so I rely on these pads for their kennels. Cats like to cover their 'business' so these pads lay flat better than others I have tried that wind up getting bunched up in a corner. I have just reordered more. Just one note - I first had them wrong side up thinking the blue color was the plastic - wrong, blue side up and they'll absorb very well!"
2,Quality has diminished,"I have been buying Iris Neat N Dry pads for a long time, and I'm ready to find something new. The pads have gotten thinner and less absorbant. Urine is leaking through to my floor."
5,Great purchase and happy with quanity.....,"I thought they would be a little bigger for my tiny Yorkie but they are very tiny, so you will use more. The quanity is great because you'll need them. Overall, very happy."
4,Excellent Value - Good Product,"Items arrived very quickly. I've tried many pads at all different price points and this product is the best value and quality for your money. The pads are slightly smaller then most of the ones I've used in the past, but the absorbancy is good and again, for the price you pay it can't be beat."
4,Terrific for carpet or hardwood floor,"I have 2 Scottish Terrier puppies and have been using this brand of pads for a month. If you know anything about Scotties they are fierce chewers which is why I only gave these pads 4 stars. It takes some work on their part, but my pups can shred them pretty well.I tried less expensive pads and they refused to use them. That's not normal behavior for a typical puppy. But for a Scottie, anything is possible.The pads are very absorbent and work well on carpet or hardwood. I am looking forward to the day when I no longer have buy these -- but they really are awesome. MUCH better than yucky newspaper. Well worth the money."
3,They're alright,"I wouldn't call them the BEST pee pads ever... they're just... alright. I ordered this brand because they were the only ones that would actually ship to me in Hawaii. I usually buy the pee pads by Four Paws, but they won't ship to me anymore (probably too much of a hassle... it's okay... they only lost a customer... grrr)! The Four Paws brand are $70 bucks for 150 at Petco which is a complete WASTE of money when they are only $35 bucks online... I'm so upset they will no longer ship to me. :(But anyway... back to the review on these ones... they are okay. The regulars are a bit small. I would recommend the large or x-large ones. Urine DOES leak through a little bit, but it's not horrible... they aren't the best quality, but for the price, I will continue buying them... as long as they continue to ship to me that is... :/"
3,Neat 'n Dry,"The service of receiving this product was amazingly fast and I certainly appreciate your promptness. As for the product...packed neatly in a sealed plastic bag...sometimes difficult to get out of the bag, so tightly pressed together...the pads absorb and work well if you take them up pretty close to immediately...they are smaller than I anticipated and if left, say overnight, seep on to the floor. OK, but not the best I've ever used."
5,Great for cats too!,I purchased these for my old kitty who had accidents outside the litter box. Work great! Very absorbant and great for when owners are away long hours!
1,Do not buy. Does not absorb pee.,"My dog peed on right in the middle of this pad and when I went to throw it away, there was a giant wet spot under it. Luckily I had a plastic puppy blanket underneath. The good reviews for this product are from years ago. Obviously something has changed since then. I have only used one other brand of puppy pads, Four Paws Wee Wee pads, and have not had this problem before. Guess I should've stuck with the more expensive kind that actually works."
3,Lacking,"These pads are not very absorbent. I would prefer if they were a bit more padded or the material was improved, so that there wouldn't be soak-through on my floor."
2,Will never purchase again,OMG.. I bought these thinking they were going to be a good investment. I was wrong. I have to use two at a time because they are so small. They aren't absorbent at all. I have a small dog and these have been the worst puppy pads I've ever purchased for him. Back to petco we go.
1,DO NOT BELIEVE THE GOOD REVIEWS !!,"I have bought this because one of my cats refuses to use the litter box, EVERY TIME the urine goes through and I have to wash the floor! Completely defeats the purpose, if I wanted to wash the floor every time I would have just used newspaper and did not have to pay money!"
2,Too small and not for training puppies,I bought these based on all the positive reviews but a few major items that I either did not see in other reviews or did not take heed too that I wanted to warn others about. These things made this product completely unusable. The size small is incredibly small. I have a 7lb puppy that doesn't even have room to circle and I even think they would have been too small even when he was 4lbs. Their is no adhesive on the bottom which means he can easily move the pads around which is a total pain when you're trying to train your puppy to use the pad to pee rather than as a toy. Other than that they do seem very absorbent and I may try these again once my dog is older and completely trained.<>
3,okay product,"i ordered the 100pk from reading the reviews and seeing how well this product placed in the amazon ranking but after using it, i regret not ordering a smaller pack to test it out.its a bargain priced product and it does do what it advertised to do but not very well. When i lift the pad off the floor i see huge wet spot underneath the pad not limited to the edges but in the middle of the pad as well, so it tells me that the product is not very absorbent.i know for sure i wouldnt order this product again and look for a better solution, hopefully with the adhesive on the bottom of the pad."
3,Decent product,"I bought these after having used the Out Wee Wee pads thinking these would be better than Out. But I was highly disappointed. The pads were smaller, so I had to use more of them at a time. My dog isn't attracted to them whatsoever, so he would pee all in the wrong place. I couldn't wait to finish using them so I could try a different brand. The only good thing about these pee pads was the price. Amazon has a pretty good price on these. But if you are thinking of buying pee pads, I would go for the Out brand instead. The price is similar and the quality is much better."
1,the price is outragous!,i cannot believe how they've more than double the price of this product! it is a good product but jacking up the price like this is just not right.
1,Not absorbent at all!!!,I had another brand that worked really well as far as absorbing and being a good size. These were regular size but were smaller than the regular size of the other brand. My main problem is they don't absorb good enough. When I would go to pick up after one use they would drip all over my floors still.
2,not worth the price,"some of the pads had no material in parts of the pad, just a bottom and top sheet together, they should have been sold as irregular, seconds or something, you could see right through them, thin as a paper towel."
4,Good Pads,"These are some of the best pads I have used for my small dog. They do not leak and usually keep the urine from running over the edge onto the floor. While not perfect, they are the best I have found. I have used them with the tray when my dog was younger and without now that he is older and doesn't try to drag them around."
5,Great Puppy pads!,"My three eight week old Pom puppys love these pads!They work great. The first time I put the pad on the floor my little Claira Bell went straight to the pad and went potty on it(good girl)and she continues to go to the pad and potty. These pads are extra thick and last longer, in addition they are more sturdy than the cheaper brands. Because I like this product so much, I just put in another order for a pack of the small and medium size pads, I also recieved the free shipping, what a deal!"
1,horrible,"These pads are too thin, does not hold urine, and would not dry for hours. I had better experiences with cheaper ones. I have a 4 year old 8 lbs poodle mix and never had any leakage problems with other training pads before. Just horrible......"
1,Does not stand up to normal use.,My 8 lb MinPin easily soaks this pad clear through with the first use. I will never purchase this product again.
1,Disappointed!,I was very disappointed in this product. The pads did not fit the medium potty training tray. My puppy was able to pull it out of the tray very easily. I think that the mediums should be sold as smalls.
3,Quality Great...Size Insufficient!,"Although the size is clearly indicated in the description, I have since discovered that even for a very small puppy this size isn't sufficient. We have a two pound yorkiepoo and this size pad is not recommended by me if you are going to leave your dog alone even for only a couple of hours. I would definitely recommend the next size up, as we have found that our little yorkie""POO"" can make quite a mess in just a short while. They have to step onto the pad, and once they have eliminated once, they will step in whatever is already there as the pad is not as absorbant as I would have wanted."
3,Not that great,"Very cheap, basically you get what you pay for. Would rather spend the money for the more expensive brands since they actually absorb. Purchased this for my cat who's kidneys are failing and he's been having accidents. I can only imagine how bad they'd be with a puppy...."
1,Iris Neat 'n Dry - WAY TO THIN,"These dog pads are way to thin, even for a puppy. I have to put 3 on top of each other. I can't imagine how they can be used on any dog on the picture on the bag. Waste of money and flooring."
1,Worst pads ever,I bought these pads based on reviews and boy was I disappointed. I use them for an older cat who doesn't like to pee in the litter box. These pads have absolutely no absorbency. The pee just rolls off and on to my floors. So disgusting and frustrating. I wouldn't recommend them for any animal.
2,Too Chincy,"These are the thinnest chanciest pad I have ever bought. No wonder they are so inexpensive! Remember the adage... you get what you pay for... pay a little more and get a better quality. The pads I purchased prior to these cost $22.00 for 100 and they where of top quality, try to find those."
5,Good buy,"I loved the product. It worked great for me. The quality is the same as when you buy the smaller count in the box, so do not waste your money and buy the bigger pack for less money"
3,Too small and not that absorbent,"I bought these pads because some reviewers raved about them, however, I really wish I didn't. They are too small for my Pomeranian. I have to use two pads. If it was just a tiny big bigger, it would be awesome!I would return the pads, but I haven't had time to go out and purchase any, which is why I chose to buy online.They also aren't as absorbent as I thought they would be. The floor gets wet. Luckily it is a slate floor, but man oh man, am I tired of mopping it!I will have to stick with Arm and Hammer I think. Those seem to work well."
4,They work ok,These work ok but are not as thick as some other brands which means thay will not absorb as much. They are ok in a pinch.
4,GREAT value!,"They do the job, don't leak through and they're CHEAP compared to other brands (Petco)."
5,Best puppy pad ever,Really like these puppy pads. They are large and trap fluid in so there is no mess! Can't beat the price!
2,This product does what it is suppose to.,"This product does what it is suppose to. However, they were much smaller in size than the previous pads I have used. If you only have one small dog or a new small puppy, then they would be great, but I have two Poms and find that I have to use more pads than I would have normally for larger size pads."
4,Puppy Pads,"I love these pads so far the best but the downside to this is that the ""regular"" size are way too small I wish I was able to get 100 count in a bigger size."
3,"good size, good absorbtion, but too expensive","These had great absorbtion, but they were a little too expensive for me. I found buying the medical pads for humans in bulk at my discount store was more economical."
5,Absolutely beautiful score to a grand movie![.],I think that this really deserved to win the golden globe for best sountrack because it is the best I think of all the ones that were nominated!! I love all of the Mexican singers on espcially the track that Selma Hayek sang on! I strongly urge those of you who loved the movie or who like Spanish music to get this one you will not be dissapointed with your purchase![.]
5,Must Have if you liked Frieda,I love the emotion of the Movie so well that I had to add this to my collection. In fact I have one for my office and one for the car. The movie was so emotional and revealing about the life of Frieda Carlo that I wanted the music. Director Tayor did an outstanding job on the life of Frieda that the CD just grounds you to life in general. All of the artists singing on this are at their very best. Had to have this one....
4,It's good,"But I don't think it's all it's hyped up to be on the other reviews, but, I do like it to the point of keeping it. It's the perfect 4star rating."
4,Review for Music from Frida,Some it this CD sounds strange but very emotional and combined with some easy listening Latin music is a great addition. I'm looking forward to hearing it again after I exhaust my Christmas music CDs.
3,"hmm, not what you'd expect...","Of course Goldenthal would win accolades for a film score which is pretty atypical for his body of work. Gone are the driving basses, the thunderous percusions, the Strussian strings. They're replaced with latin flavors and some great songs which, while wonderful, are not what a true fan of Goldenthal's work would expect. Perhaps he got the Oscar for his work the previous year for FINAL FANTASY, a much better work and vastly more representative of Goldenthal's style."
5,Frida the Soundtrack - A fond remembrance of the movie,"I have seen the movie twice now, and during the second viewing I got to really listen to the musical background. It truly deserved the recognition of the Grammy Award The songs capture the tempestuous life of Frida Kahlo........the passion, the darkness, and the pain. Some very old mexican ranchera standards, included in the track, brought back memories of mi familia, and the emotion of Mexico during Kahlo's life."
2,Worst pirate music I have heard!,As a pirate fanatic I am always looking for some really good music. Something that invokes adventure and excitement into my soul. This is NOT it. I was extremely disappointed when I popped this in the player. All the tracks sound the same. I haven't played the dvd yet but don't waste your time with the cd.
5,FOR THE GOOD TIMES,THIS C.D. IS MUCH BETTER THAN THE FIRST COPY I BOUGHT. IT ERASED ITSELF IN LESS THAN A YEAR...GO FIGURE. THIS C.D. HAS MUCH BETTER SOUND AND LESS BACKGROUND STATIC.
4,A classic and worth every penny,"It's hard not to like classic honky-tonk, and when it's smoothly delivered by Ray Price, it's even better. High points: Heartaches by the Number and Crazy Arms. But all the tracks are excellent. Country music before it got orchestras and strings."
5,only 3 classic singers left on this planet,"When I first heard Ray I thought he was schmaltzy you know music for old people. Since I am old now I realize what an anthem he is for classic country music. I remember seeing him at the Medina Ballroom west of Minneapolis Mn. several years ago. He was INCREDIBLE with a 17 piece band, blue suit and a red string tie, microphone tight to his chest singing like a Bird. I stood in line for an autograph and Kissed him on the forehead and ran away quickly so he wouldn't catch me and beat me up. No smoking was allowed at the Medina that night 2 weeks later he was busted for POT possession In Texas."
1,:o(,"I don't even remember buying this book. Forgive my poor memory. So therefore, there isn't anything I can say about it."
5,I couldn't sit still,"I was sitting at my desk listening to Hober.com when a Maddrum Sonando song came on. My body leaped to it's feet and started dancing before my consciousness kicked in. As soon as the song was over, I realized that I had to have the CD, jumped onto Amazon and bought it. Now I'm dancing to the whole CD. Ain't life great!"
5,Awesome EP that bridges the gap between old + new Hives,"This Ep retains a lot of the punkiness heard on the Barely Legal and Oh Lord, When How? cd's, but it also clearly represents the new kinks-esque sound they are going for now. This Ep is out of print domestically, so if you can find an import version, I suggest you pick it up. Tracks include a faster version of ""Outsmarted"" from Veni Vidi Vicious, and a hot cover of ""Numbers"" (by the Adicts) that originally appeared on the Hives' split seven inch with the Pricks. Also the title track ""A.K.A. I-D-I-O-T"" is a slightly different version than the one on the Barely Legal album. The unreleased tracks tracks on this Ep make it a worthwhile venture to track it down."
3,Helpful But Annoying,"I found Seirawan's tactics manual helpful to review basic tactical patterns, but annoying in its many mistakes and its sometimes adolescent tone. I'm not talking about mistakes in analysis--I did not check his lines with Fritz--but lots of typographical and word choice errors that a competent proof-reader would have caught. For a book that is otherwise aesthically well-designed, this is really hard to understand. As to the tone, perhaps the idea was to market this to adolescents. If you want a more mature tone and don't want to be distracted by a relentless onslaught of production errors, study John Nunn's Learn Chess Tactics. I'd love to give Seirawan 5 stars, but I take one off for the tone and another for the proliferation of mistakes."
4,Great resource for the developing hobbyist to take a step deeper into chess theory,"Seirawan offers a compelling toolbox of chess tactics - patterns that you can look for and exploit in novel and surprising ways - and the resources to train you to recognize them. He offers a great balance between lecturing, practice puzzles, and raw delight as he examines dramatic games with an excitement that is contagious. His focus is mostly on the mid-game and end-game, with almost no material that will help with openings - you'll want to find other resources for that. But in his focus he does a good job of covering patterns not only in an introductory way, but showing how to spot opportunities to use them that might not be obvious even if you were familiar with them. If you are an aspiring novice chess player, you will at very least enjoy this book and will almost certainly come out a stronger player."
5,Trains Your Mind To See Options,"Seirawan and Silman have put together a great book! Each chapter covers a particular tactic or combination using the tactic- then presents a number of ""tests"" that force you to use what he's just covered. Seems to work very well in getting my mind to internalize the concepts."
5,Best introduction to tactics for beginners,"I've never seen such a good introduction to tactics. Seirawan explains everything very clearly, with excellent illustrations.Seirawan included several hundred problems in the book. I'd recommend following up this book with Reinfeld's 1001 Winning Chess Sacrifices and Combinations. In fact, if you're a talented player, you might want to skip Seirawan's book and go straight to Reinfeld. But most of us could use Seirawan's book."
3,Some minor flaws but a decent book overall,Yasser is a good author. The problem is this book lacks the meaningful content. He did explain it very well though.
2,Had a hard time with this book,"This book should come with a warning! Hazardes to a beginners health. I actually think that I am more than a beginner, but not advanced either. But the problems set in the book are not for chess kids who are not real experienced. I found them very hard to solve and sometimes I got confused. But if you are an adult you can probably understand this book a hole lot better. I guess I overstepped my abilities by getting this book. But I am not tossing it away! I will look it again when I getter more experience and may reright this review. Just not for kids unless you are very advanced for a kid."
5,So dog eared I'll have to buy another!,"After 12+ years of not playing, I was really rusty. The patzers were no problem but until I studied this book, the club players were eating me alive. It refreshed my memories of winning combinations and now the club has to be careful or I'll eat them alive! If you need a good book that is easy to read, easy to understand, and a book that any player below class A could use this is it. If my game starts to slack, I always pick it up again. The problems and tests are great for beginner to accomplished player. My book is getting a little worn and I'm sure it will be the first book in my collection that will have to be replaced from continual use. I salute you Yasser and Jeremy!"
3,Not bad,"This is a reasonably good book on tactics for an intermediate player like myself. The ""building on tactics"" by going from a more simple form to more complicated tactics could be improved.My favorite book containing tactics is ""Winning Chess Tournaments for Juniors"" (it has a lot more than just tactics to improve your game).However, this is still a reasonably good book."
2,Not the best organized but some nice tactics non the less!,"I feel that this book had some tactics not placed in the best order to develop the best pattern recognition. A more logical ""building"" from simple to more complex based on the type of pattern that the author is trying to develop should have been incorportated.This being said, I need to point out that there are some good tactics included - However, this doesn't make a book - the quality of understanding what an intermediate player needs to know is most important (certainly this book is not for small kids or beginners!)."
2,One of numerous tactics books,"Sometimes the author doesn't make things clear in the book for the intermediate player. Beginners would be lost (don't even think about getting this book if you are just beyond the very basics).However, there is a fairly wide coverage of the important tactics. I enjoyed Combination Challenge by Hays and Winning Chess Tournaments for Juniors (actually the best first book that had good coverage of tactics) more."
4,A good overview of the most important tactics,"There are three types of books that you should learn tactics from, 1. a general book on tactics that tells you what they are and explains the mechanics of them by name (THIS BOOK!!!), 2. a workbook that has hundreds of tactical puzzles to solve, and 3. chess traps book that covers tactics in openings showing how you get their from the start.Seirawan's book is very clear and undstandable. A good starting place!"
4,Likeable but not lovable,"I must truely say if you are looking for a book on true tactics this book isn't so bad. It is rather good!Not the way I would have written it as I have found some mistakes, typos and if you really not a beginner you need far more than tactics (See my review on UNBEATABLE CHESS LESSONS FOR JUNIORS - you wil learn more from it than this book, but also get this book on a secondary basis along with WINNING CHESS TOURNAMENTS FOR JUNIORS with great tactics and advice to make you great).First best - CHESS FOR JUNIORS SERIE by Snyder, Second best - WINNING SERIES by Seirawan. Consider them both!"
4,"Good for beginners, which I am one","It seems a bit basic, but this is a beginner's course book. After reading it, and practice, my wins to losses improved greatly from where I was normally at or very near the bottom of the pack a tournametns to the point where had I taken the draw my opponent offered me, I would have finished 4th out of 48. This was over the course of 6 or 8 weeks.It worked for me, but I don't think I will review tactics with it. I am sure there is more for me to learn from it, but I think other books that have more puzzles would benefit me more."
1,This guy is confused who wrote this book,I may be just a kid but I can tell you the person who wrote this book does not have his act together. He should do a better job of first introducing an easy idea then building on it to make it harder. In other words what I am saying is that Mr. Serawan may be a great player but is not the best teacher of the game. I saw his video too and he is an uncomfortable teacher and gets mixed up in front of a camera. He does not do much better as a teacher who writes.
2,Confusing for a beginner or someone just beyond that point,"There are a few major problems with this book. The writter is probably used to teaching very advanced players being such a good player he does not always understand the way much less players think.I will explain now what I mean by this.There is too much jumping from some easy stuff good for your average player who is just beyond the beginning stage to some very, very deep and hard stuff to understand. The book does not maintain a consistant pattern for players of the same level. A two move simple tactical problem and then a 10 move deep problem that only a master could figure out. And the simple idea doesn't build to the more difficult one like it should.Many people do not understand that sometimes a good player does not make a good teacher."
2,Winning Chess Tactics Do Not Alwyasy Win,"I have found about 6 major mistakes in this book that tactics don't win but lose!I used my top computer called Fritz and it pointed out in the first part of this book some big, big, boo boos in the book. Well check for yourself if you have the Fritz computer. Maybe he should have had the same computer program first before writting the book or at least use it because it teaches you to look before moving, not the book but the program. I must be honest. I gave up on the book when the first 20 or so problems had the computer point out that the solution was not the best!!!!"
1,Doesn't Compare,"This book doesn't compare to the other book I have that cover tactis, HOW TO BEAT YOUR DAD AT CHESS (much better for covering checkmates), WINNING CHESS TOURNAMENTS FOR JUNIORS (better for the entir tactics/checkmates section and entire series all together) and 1001 WINNING CHESS SACRIFICES AND COMBINATIONS (fantastic chess workbook)."
4,Pretty good,"This book was well thought out and well written, but I think that 'Chess Tactics For The Tournament Player' by Alburt is better. The latter has an entire chapter devoted to actually calculating variations, something that Seirawan ignores. The chapter includes all the psychological things that can go wrong when calculating. Also there is more emphasis on destruction, destructive combinations and other things not covered in Seirawans book. All in all Seirawan did an excellent job with this book, but adding some text on actually calclating combos would help."
5,"Great, unexpected find","Sounds something like a folk, Irish-influenced version of Weezer (at least when the guitars kick in). But each song has a unique, catchy melody spanning the decibel range. The lyrics get more hackneyed as the album goes on (starting around song 10), but the earlier songs are great for their intelligent verbage. Not a lot of risks in the musical melodies, but a lot of different sounds to be had. The singer has a good voice, she should push it more. Nothing awful on this album, but a lot that's really good."
5,suprisingly nifty,"I too bought this album on a whim after a friend recommended it, and I too was pleasantly surprised. It's a solid album from the first to the last track, though the ""carnival"" tracks verge on being a little too cute for my taste. Even so, it's a laid-back album that doesn't try to stretch beyond what it can deliver consitently: melodic, and infectiously *pleasing* tunes."
2,"Bland, pretentious music; cynical, downer lyrics","Apparently, this album has a cult following, and they all like to write reviews! I suppose it works as background music, but not much more. I realize art appreciation is highly subjective and, clearly, this music has made a strong impression on some. To me, though, the album comes off as pretentious. Then again, if you hear deep truths in it, more power to you."
5,That's How I choose to remember it,"Wow. This album is wonderful. With lyrics and vocals that draw you in and take ahold of your being, Rilo Kiley has once again released an awesome album. Get this one now. Especially touching is the track ""Better son/daughter"""
5,wonderful after many years.,I love the lightness of the plates. I'm older and have troubles with my hands and wrist. They are pretty too. I moved to a Senior Community and brought these dishes instead of my more expensive and heavier set.
5,As clear as green gets,"This book was amazing and clearly communicates in intricate balance of business and the environment in a way that anyone can relate to. Many concpets presented in this book have stayed with me for a long time, and I find them easy to apply to my business communications in a reasonable way. I recommend this book for every business person ir student, the sustainable attitude is what is going to be influencing the next generation of business people, and this book provides a solid cornerstone of knowledge that anyone can use."
3,Scent is not what I was looking for,"This past summer I spent some time in Nice and bought some rose-scented French soap. I loved the smell and went to the internet to find a perfume that was like that. I read many reviews before I purchased So Magic, and it sounded as if it was just what I wanted....but it wasn't. This perfume is discontinued, and it may be that the perfume is a little old and not quite what it used to be. This is a very sweet scent ( almost cloying) that might be nice on a young girl between 10 and 16, but not for any woman who is looking for a real fragrance. It's my own fault for buying perfume online without smelling it first. I will not do that again."
3,"Not a water toy! (but terrific, nonetheless)","OK, I wish I had read the customer reviews first before I got this doll wet because this doll is NOT a water toy. Ariel's voice is barely audible after her ""bath"" and her see-through, water-and-glitter-filled body now has soap suds in it that won't come out. However, if your daughter is an Ariel fan like mine, this doll is worth every penny. This is one of the few Ariel dolls that actually does look like Ariel - all the other ones don't even come close to looking like her. Moreover, Ariel's pre-recorded song/phrases, are great."
3,Fooled by false advertising again!,"As for the detail of the doll she is beautiful, however, my daughter wanted this doll to play with in the bath tub. The commercial shows a girl playing with it in water -- so you would assume she could. When I went to purchase the doll, no where on the box does it say it can or it can't go in the water sooooo I purchased it in hopes that she could. Sad to say that after the first initial dunk, she no longer sings. She is still a beautiful doll and my daughter enjoys her because she loves Ariel--I just hate seeing my child dissapointed once again by false advertising."
2,False Advertisment,"The commericial for this doll shows her swimming in water. Now I wasn't crazy enough to believe that it could actually swim, but I did think the doll could be placed in water. NOT!!111 My daughter was very disappointed that she couldn't play with it in the bath tub. Also the dolls singing is annoying, you can't understand what she's saying."
3,Batteries Batteries Batteries,"Although my daughter was thrilled to have a doll that she could play with in the bathtub... the love affair was short lived when the batteries ran out of juice in 2 days. It says on the box that it comes with ""display batteries."" Apparently that means they don't last long. And it takes those tiny tiny camera batteries that you have to go to 6 stores before you can find them. Now I may have a little bias against battery operated toys.... I'll admit. But with all the trials of parenthood, keeping anything beyond a few extra AA batteries on hand is more than I can handle. Be warned, the doll is cute but you should stock up on tiny tiny batteries."
2,"Great Barbie, but not a bath toy","I agree with all the other reviews. The doll works great out of the water, but once she enters the water she is ruined forever. I purchased this for my 4 year old for Christmas, it was by far her favorite, she played with her all day, and at bathtime could not wait to bring her in there with her as the commercial showed her in water! Since that her voice is muffled and she only lights up once in awhile on her own. I payed $9 for replacement batteries thinking that may have been the case, but she still does not work. I looked over the insturctions, and nowhere does it specify if she can go in the water or not. Now this barbie is in a bin with all the other barbies, my daughter only plays with her at bath time now."
3,Bathub or not,"The commercials clearly show that she can swim. But, 0urs has one song and it is high pitched garbled. Water is not this dolls best friend. Great marketing to show us underwater and then the doll breaks and we have to buy another one. We have one that can go under water and had to buy another for non water play."
4,Pretty but Pretty Boring Too,"It's a lovely looking doll (except for her dark lipliner) but only has three phrases and is NOT water proof. Anything with holes in it, is not going to be waterproof. The marketing for this doll was very misleading - however for the price, it's better than having a Barbie that doen't say anything or light up. Little Mermaid fans are going to love it regardless."
4,Cute doll,"Santa gave this to our 6 year old daughter this Christmas. She loves it! She's glittery and lights up in pretty colors. The doll's singing can be annoying after the billionth time but most toys are like that. For the price and enjoyment my daughter got from this, I am more than happy."
3,"She LOVES it, but it's limited.","Ariel sparkles, sings, and dotes on her own bubbles and sparkles. It doesn't bend well to sit anywhere (in case you get the dolphin chariot). You can't take off or put on any clothes on the doll (half the fun for a little girl). The product designers should have made the fin detachable so she could have legs. This would have hugely expanded the possibilities of the doll.3 stars only because my daughter just loves it. She loves the box, too, though."
2,Do NOT put this doll in water!!!!,"I bought this BEAUTIFUL doll for my daughter's birthday in July '06. Since it says in the packaging that the doll is a water toy, we allowed our daughter to take Ariel to her swimming birthday party later that SAME day. Ariel sings a nice song - but it is difficult to understand some of the words and it is quite loud & annoying. The lights in her tail are gorgeous, though!! BUT!! Once the doll was submerged in water, her singing became very obviously affected by the water going into her 'speaker holes' & within an hour of the party - Ariel stopped working altogther! Neither my husband nor I believed this doll should ever be put in water because of the speaker holes & the battery area that is in her back that looks like it would also allow water inside....but we found it stated on the 'directions sheet' inside the box that this doll is a water toy - so we allowed it - and now this pretty doll does not do anything."
4,So much fun in the bath tub,"This was a gift for our 3 year old and our 1 and 2 year old are enjoying it just as much. They love taking it in the bath tub and turning the lights off in the bathroom. She also received the chariot and unfortunately, that hasn't been such a hit."
3,so-so,"My daughter absolutely loves Ariel, so I thought this would be a big hit with her, wrong! While she does like it, the voice is kind of warped and rough sounding. We have never taken it in the tub, it came like that right out of the box. My daughter didn't like the way she sounds and just sings on her own instead of having Ariel sing."
4,Victor Davies - Victor Davies,"Victor Davies' eponymous debut seems like a strange release for Jazzanova/Compost Records. It's full of Davies' soulful vocals and acoustic guitar playing. But when the rhythm and horns kick in on the opening track, ""Sound of the Samba,"" you know that it's a perfect match. The downtempo rhythms complement Davies' musical sensibilities perfectly. The neo-soul of ""Runaway Train"" or ""Take It or Leave It"" may be far from the dancefloor, but it's perfect for a cozy evening for two; ""One Thing"" is a sure-fire romancer. Sure, it's not traditional ""electronic"" music, but when it's this good, who cares?"
3,Flowerpots,"I liked this book. But there are better books if you are looking for a ""how-to"" for container gardening. Mr. Keeling rambles, from clay to pots to plants. Which is in order, but he just gets going on a subject and leaves it. A bit frustrating. When he stays on subject, very good. The pictures are very good, and give you the best guide for planting. This was an idea book for me. I learned quite a bit about the workings of a pottery. Interesting.Good books for containers. ""Contain Yourself"" and ""Euroamerican Container Garden Cookbook"". Both by Kerstin P. Ouellet. Also, ""Gardening in Containers"" by the Editors of Fine Gardening Magazine."
3,lovely,it is a book that portrays a young girl who is once again faced with her past - the old town hunk/sweetheart.finding her courage she faces these chalanges and i will leave the rest to your imagination. the book is filled with great charachters and a great setting i couldnt put it down
2,Great song- but extras are unfulfilling,"Being a Duran completist, I had to have both parts to this cd single. Sadly, the Harry Peat Remix of this amazing song lacks any energy. It rips the passion & urgency completely out & turns ""What Happens Tomorrow"" into a trancey, chilled-out lounge-fest. Boring.""Silent Icy River"" is less than 3 minutes long and is only a fraction of a song. It's merely a piece of music built around the 3rd verse of ""What Happens Tomorrow,"" which was ultimately edited from the album version. Interesting & artsy- but a true B-side would have been nice.The video for ""What Happens Tomorrow"" is also included here. A young couple in love lay atop their car in an empty mall parking lot & look at the stars. The starry sky then turns into Duran Duran. The band looks great, but this is not exactly their brightest concept.I love Duran Duran, but someone needs to hook them up with better remixers & video directors. This does not live up to their legacy."
4,off the quite superb Astronaut album,"Certainly not my first choice for a single, as there are a number of other songs I would have preferred off the quite superb Astronaut album, but there is no doubt that 'What Happens Tomorrow' is certainly very radio friendly, which should ensure that it maintains the bands 3rd comeback."
3,I probably have different use for this than you.,I bought this for lock picking practice. It's fun but pretty easy to pick...so I really have no clue how to rate it.
2,Yawn.,"It's well done, I suppose, but I have to say I found the whole thing a little on the monotonous and boring side. I guess it's not my kind of music."
2,Listen with headphones!!!!!!!,"I purchased this cd from a local retailer a few days ago, and it blew me away. Their production was really great, but I could only give 4 stars since k&d are the only ones I would give 5 stars to. The album is quite good, preferably listned to in the tub with a good pair of headphones. really good for those late nights spent at the club and you need something to bring you down. Good stuff at a good price( I'ts cheeper here than in the stores."
2,Where are all the blues women?,"It's not what is said in this book, but what is not. When Elvis Presley gets more space then Memphis Minnie, and Ike Turner gets more pages then Dinah Washington. I began to frown. Where is Big Maybell? Where is Big Mama Thronton? Where is Ruby Glaze? Where is Bessie Tucker? Where is Lucille Bogan? Where is Victoria Spivey? Where is Sippy Wallace? Where is Alberta Hunter? Where is Bonnie Lee? Where is Julia Lee? Where is Nellie Lutcher? Where is Ivy Smith? Where is Katie Webster? Where is Lil Johnson? Where is Bernice Edwards. Where is Ethel Waters? Where is Georgia White? It's not that I appreciate the contributions of Tina Turner or Janis Joplin they have record some fine blues, but Courtney Love? She may be a bad girl, but she is certainly NOT a blues singer. Not to mention the above women who lived the blues to the fullest is a real shame!"
5,Compelling take on blues history,"Some readers may be familiar with the general contours of the lives of the women presented here--Ma Rainey, Bessie Smith, Aretha Franklin, and others. But the way that Jackson weaves together these stories against the tapestry of 20th Century American culture is original and compelling. Jackson convincingly shows how different woman blues singers (and later rock and alt country singers) drew on each other's work for inspiration. Their contributions were cultural and social as well as artistic. Most importantly, for potential readers--Jackson tells a good story. The writing is gripping and fast-paced. I recommend it highly."
1,Doesn't work,"1. It is not convenient to wear it whole night. It's big and very disturbing.2. It doesn't monitor any sleep stages. All it does just monitors your movements. But guess what, I move during the sleep and sometimes I don't move when I wake up. Several times I woke up and was laying motionless, waiting for this damned alarm clock to ring. Then I moved my hand and ta-taaa it rang! Magic!3. I don't know, may be the idea itself is not so bad, but to pay over hundred bucks for motion sensor, which will irritate your hand for the whole night, it's to much. Night camera attached to the alarm clock on nightstand would work better.$20 is the right price, just to try it and throw it away..."
2,Doesn't do the job,"I was very excited to get an alarm that works. But it doesn't work for me. I hear it, I switch it off and sleep till the very last minute. I don't feel ready to get up when the alarm rings. So it's just like any other alarm clocks. Once I woke up before the alarm but within the 30 minutes window you set for alarm to go off and it didn't go off as if I was still asleep. It was funny to see when it picks the appropriate time to wake me up."
2,Not loud enough,"I don't rely on this watch alone to wake me up. Its alarm signal is not loud enough.The watch does provide one useful capability: it tells me how often I moved around during my sleep, and at what times."
4,"Works well, but have a backup.","This watch mostly works as promised. As one of the previous reviewers stated, without enough sleep, it doesn't wake me up, but usually I can hear it with at least 6 hours of good sleep, (and I have some hearing loss). I usually wake up feeling well rested with the alarm, as opposed to nearly comatose with any other alarm."
4,"Simple, but Effective","When I first bought the Sleeptracker, I was bewildered by the device. I wondered what sort of alien technology they planned to use to wake me.Once I started using the Sleeptracker, I realized that the alarm is just triggered by a motion-sensor. I toss and turn most nights when I sleep. I quickly realized that when I rolled over in my ""wake up window"" the alarm went off.So, while not ""space age technology,"" the Sleeptracker is a pretty useful little device. I use it nightly. I usually just turn the alarm off when it beeps. But, when I DO get out of bed at the Sleeptracker's command, those are my most productive, efficient mornings.So, yeah, it works. And, I'd recommend it for anyone who REALLY likes to use their snooze button several times in the morning. But, you still need to muster the willpower to roll yourself out of bed when it beeps at you."
3,Does what it promises. Moderately effective,"This gadget does what it promises - wakes you up when you are almost awake. Having said that, I find it moderately effective - I am still grumpy no matter what. And being woken up 15 min before my alarm rings just makes me even grumpier."
2,Novelty wears off,"The idea of this thing is really good, and when I first got it I could swear that it worked. After a couple of weeks though things got back to normal. I use this daily (habit) and I have to say that I feel no different being woken up by this, to my mobile phone. 9 times out of 10 I hit the snooze button on it twice in a row and end up being woken by my mobile phone (backup).The buttons also cease functioning very well - it's quite cheaply made for the hurrendous price."
3,Works some of the time,"I can't deny that this watch's purpose is sometimes successful. However I have some misgivings:First: for a watch that I nearly paid $150 it needs to have more options, be louder and be more durableSecond: Sometimes wearing it just doesn't make any difference at all.Whether you buy it or not is up to you, but my advice would be to focus on getting to bed early. No matter what you wear or take, you will feel like crap if you don't get enough rest at night."
4,"Stop waking up tired... wake up when it best for YOU, not your Alarm!",We were intrigued when we first read about this device. We wondered if it would be just the thing to help us get up when we had to adapt to different time zones.(...)
2,Not loud enough!,"This gadget seemed like a great idea, but I've sampled two different watches and the wake-up beep is so quiet that I can barely hear it when wide awake."
3,"Great idea ...Large, and could use vibrate mode","This is a wonderful idea. I've had the watch now for about a month. It took a while to get used to wearing a watch -- let alone such a BIG watch -- when going to sleep. The watch does work as advertised ...and it's nice to have the large numbers if I'm wearing contacts (I'm a geek, and so am nearsighted ...when wearing contacts for distance, it helps to have a watch with large numbers). But since I sometimes wear earplugs, it would be very helpful if either the alarm were louder, or (better yet) if the watch alarm could vibrate. In fact, a vibrate mode would have the additional benefit that it would wake ME without waking my wife."
2,Gorgeous visuals in Search of a Story to Tell,"This film looks great, but it's story is about as predictable and hackneyed as most 80's-era action movies. It's predictable, bland, and boring. None of the complexity of Shirow's manga is present in this cash-grab despite a multitude of opportunities to expand the philosophical edge of the story. Unfortunately, this is one to skip entirely."
2,lol,this movie sucks bad enough to be laughable. some one else reviewed it and said it it's like watching a video game cut scene. and there right.it's like... actualy it's like a crappy john woo movie (thats not to say the all suck i actually like hardboiled.)
1,Appleseed Fans Beware!,"I hate this DVD. Ok why do I hate it?The story is all over the place, it seems like several people worked on the story and threw a final version together. Also the story does not follow any of Mr. Shirow's original books, which is a shame since his original story is such an Excellent original mix of CyberPunk and Greek mythology. I wonder if the movie writers read the original stories at all!The Animation quality is not up to the standard of the first movie. The characters are not rendered is the same beautiful style of the first DVD. It is close, but it is different.One Star. There are alot of cool Mech models in this the 2nd Appleseed DVD movie. And the city models and sets are also quite awesome.If you are expecting a SHIROW Appleseed movie, forget it, it's not here.Very disappointed!"
5,Correction,"correction to Mr. (The Bandit King) this is the blu-ray format and not the HD-DVD, so have fun everyone this one is a great movie."
3,2.5 stars due to John Woo involvement,"Not as good as the first Appleseed 3D version, which I think is excellent. The problem with this version? John Woo. His influence in the project is blatant...overuse of diving gun shots and fluttering flocks of doves is just abused in this film. Abused to the point where flocks of doves flying around the camera is actually a plot device instead of just an annoyance!! making it doubly annoying!!! Also, the stylized 3D animation is nearly as well done as the first Appleseed 3D."
5,Better than the first ...,"Take the old movie, ramp it up, & you've got 1 helluva opening sequence!This anime was rendered in 3D rather than 2D.You can see the difference.If you like good anime, this is one of the classics.It was so good, I picked up the Collector's Edition steel case.Tersely, animated violence that doesn't make you think ""Oh man, this is kiddy cartoons."""
4,A good follow to the original,"Back in 2004, Appleseed came stateside, after being in Japan for years. For it's time, it had great special effects alongside some of the best CGI seen. Now its 2008, and Appleseed Ex Machina is here. I must say, CGI just keeps getting better, and this is a shining example of that. Animations, facial expressions and the lip-movement when the characters are talking help bring this anime life. Since John Woo helped produce the sequel, expect to see some of his trademarks, like the doves and slow motion sequences. But they all fit into the movie perfectly. For being a sequel, I am surprised how this turned out. However, if I have to pick out one gripe, that would be the dialog. Some of the lines can get on the cheesy side. Other than that, be sure to give this a look if you've seen the original. Otherwise, if you are the least bit interested in GCI/Anime, still give this one a chance."
4,Not Bad For An Action Flick,"For an action release, this is very good. The action is intense and is driven by a plausible story, characters and animation. The plot holes and sometimes less than stellar writing will take audiences out of the element sometimes but overall there isn't a lot here to complain about. Despite how much I didn't care for the earlier release from this series, this release is surprisingly entertaining to watch. While it won't be something that I personally suggest to anyone who will listen, fans that are looking for a strong action release to spend an evening with would be well advised to keep their eyes open for this one."
2,Disappointing - save your money,"Truly disappointing in so many ways it's hard to know where to start.Dialogue - The worst aspect of this movie is the unbelievably horrible dialogue; so bad it will make you cringe.Story - As others have noted, you get the feeling there were multiple writers for the story and they kept getting fired and only using half of the previous writers work; a few almost interesting points are brought up in the movie and then abandoned before they can be explored. It should also be noted that the movie steals (without adding or improving) quite a lot from other movies, the matrix, the borg cube, etc.Animation - While it's admittedly a nice clean HD transfer, the actual CG animation used looks like it's from one of the straight-to-video Barbie movies; half the time the characters move in a very unnatural, stilted way.My recommendation: instead of purchasing this, just watch the previous Appleseed movie again, it wasn't that great either, but much better than this."
3,I wouldn't buy this one... but it's a good rent,"I am a devoted fan of REAL animation. CG just doesn't do it for me.... but I must say of all the CG animation features I have watched, I found this one the most enjoyable. Obviously a lot of work went into this production, even if it wasn't created through sweat and blood over the drawing table. It's like watching a very long cut scene from a video game."
4,Good but not Great,"Ex Machina is a pretty good, but not as good as the first Appleseed movie:Appleseed (Limited Collector's Edition). The CG animation is much improved though. The story line was not as good as it could have been, but the beautiful graphics make up for it. All-in-all though I'd have to say this movie is definitely worth buying for any anime fan, aspiring CG artist, or action movie lover."
4,Excellent and worth a couple viewings at least,My wife and I greatly enjoyed Ex Machina. Especially the visuals of the first scenes in the Cathedral. Spectacular imagery and a good story to boot.
4,Great story - but I'm still not sold on the CGI....,"The CGI is good, mind you(not as good as Beowulf), but I do miss the look of the hand drawn animation that I grew up with and then got me hooked during my college days.Although, given the trend of todays current animation(dead leaves style) maybe I should be glad that they decided to go CGI and not something like that.Anyone who likes action anime and a story and world in the vane of Ghost in the Shell will like this. Maybe a rental before purchase, but given the inexpensive nature of the HD-DVD/DVD combo disc, 2 rentals will get you this!"
4,Ex Machina rocks!,"This movie, or I should say animated film is awesome but I only gave it 4 stars cause it has quite a few slow spots. What can I say I like my movies flowing constantly."
3,Appleseed Ex Machina,"A new take on the Appleseed story. This anime does NOT follow on from any of the other Appleseed stories and is instead a new take on it.The CG animation is impressive, the story fun and enjoyable, the fight scenes brilliant. This is a good addition for your collection if you enjoy futureistic, sci-fi animes. I actually enjoyed the story more than in the original Appleseed."
4,Great 3D animation and great action,"If u like a good story with great action and animation then this appleseed movie is definately worth checking out. This is definately a step above the last Appleseed movie,"
4,good not great,This movie was good but its characters looked a bit rubbery they should stick with orginal artwork and it arrived a week early
3,"Looks great, not the best story.","The CG animation is better then ever (not cell-shaded like the last) and looks fantastic. Shirow's art never looked so good. The previous film though, was much better written and a lot less predictable. Ex Machina has distinct story holes and an overly-contrived setup that makes the whole thing seem forced. Story that should have been more developed wasn't and plot that should have been trimmed was needlessly stretched.I enjoyed the art, as I usually do with Shirow's work, and the voice acting wasn't bad either, but don't expect a brilliant screenplay. With the right expectations it's enjoyable for most any Otaku."
3,Shadow of the first,"This second installment of Appleseed is a pale shadow of the first movie.The story is nowhere near as engaging. The animation is second rate at best compared to the first. At least in the first one the voices sync with the animation pretty well, not so in this one. I give it 3 stars only as a gift."
3,Whiny Love Story,"Whilst, the animation is top notch, the story line felt a lot like I was watching a young adult romance novel converted to an anime. There was a lot of room to improve character development, especially the conflict between the main character's new partner and old. I would have liked to see less love story, more character development, and more combat."
2,Not as good as Appleseed.,"To me, story is important. Appleseed was much more better than EX Machina. Also, this movie didn't seem to be as dark and had more of a generic Hollywood feel to it. To be honest, Appleseed was so good I didn't expect this to be good as Appleseed. However, I didn't expect it to be this bad. The graphics are better on EX Machina, but who cares if the movie isn't fulfilling."
3,for halloween purposes only,"picture shown is of natural, beautiful hair . when i received it i was very disappointed at this hot mess of a wig. it is very full and has alot of ""hair"". i brushed it out and had to cut it to where it was no longer that bad. i did get to fix it to where i was happy with it. the reason i gave it 3 stars was because we went as barbarians and, well, it was perfect. my husband was the one who actually wore it after all (i wore a different one) and he was a big hit! we tied a loose hair tie and the layers came out to look perfect. it has two combs that are suppsed to help you put it into place and i had a hard time with it, but he had no problem with it(he is also completely bald). i do recommend this one for a rocker, biker, etc. the layers were nice and it has good bangs. for haloween only."
2,Not good for the beginner,"As the title suggests, the premise of the book (actually an extended essay) is to discuss the connections between Taoism and architecture. In his treatment of the material, he presupposes that the reader has a familiarity with both architecture and Taoism. Thus, a reader without a background in architecture or Taoism quickly becomes confused. Combined with the inherent difficulty in understanding Taoism, this makes the book very difficult to read. If the reader is truly interested in Taoism, I suggest buying The Tao of Physics or The Tao of Pooh."
2,The Ridgid lacks Rigidity,"The insert fits the saw very well and is easy to install. I am disappointed at the lack of rigidity of the insert in the center section of the insert. The flex at the center is a minumum of 1/16"" even with a light piece of wood."
1,Amazon's Description Inaccurate,"Amazon states that these locks feature Kwikset's SmartKey technology, which allows you to easily rekey the locks yourself. However, these do not feature Kwikset's SmartKey technology. You CANNOT rekey these locks yourself. Also, Amazon states that you get 6 keys with this combo pack. You don't. You get 4 keys. Also, these locks are only grade 3 (the lowest security standard on any Kwikset locks). If you want locks you can rekey and that have higher security, this set is not for you. I'm returning this set immediately."
1,item is described inaccurately,"Received, but was disappointed that it is Kwikset Security, not Kwikset MAXIMUM Security as described. There is a big difference between the two."
4,Kick it fast!,"Mensen is here to rock and they don't have a lot of time to waste!I can't think of a better intro to my review but all I need to say is that if you like ""Barely Legal"" by the Hives, ""Raw Power"" by the Stooges, or anything by Radio Birdman or the New Bomb Turks, you'll dig Mensen.Because its garagey punk rock (or punk-ish garage rock?) played thick and fast, just like on ""Destroy-Oh-Boy!!!"" only with a bratty swedish woman on vocals.This is 28 minutes of absolutely blazing rock n roll. If that sounds like your thing (it's mine!) then I invite you to buy away."
3,LJS High Seas,"eBell's Review sounds like it was for the Echo Bridge Versions...The Direct Version only has 12 episodes, Echo has 13 and between the 2 you get 14 Different episodes.Direct Version doesn't have The Orphans Christmas or The Execution Dock but has Dragon SlayerDirect Versions Color are more washed out and sound is about the same as Echo's Version.In my opinion it is 50/50 between the two but leaning a little to Echo because I can adjust ratio better on the Echo version with VLC Player.......I got them both and have 14 episodes..."
4,Interior Design Professionals,This was a great book for interior designers interested in the business aspect of design. Minimal highlighting but overall good condition.
1,The Interior Design Business Handbook: A Complete Guide to Profitability (Hardcover),"I was disappointed when I received the book. I thought I was purchasing the fourth edition which is the green book. The book was in good shape, but I wasn't expecting an older version."
3,OK debut novel...strains credulity though..,"Fern Michael's debut novel ""Pride and Passion"" is an OK novel. It follows a spirited woman from New England who inherits part of a plantation in Brazil. She meets Sebastian Riviera, a mysterious plantation owner who resents the other owner of the plantation our heroine is going to. Thye argue, but they fall in love with each other, and they uncover inhuman cruelty at her plantation and a long-ago murder. The villain gets what's coming to him, of course, but not before innocent blood is shed."
5,Answered all my questions.,"I found this book incredibly helpful. During the most trying time of my life, any questions I had in the middle of the night were answered by using this book. I think every woman who has been diagnosed with breast cancer and her family should own this book."
3,"Great lineup, Bad results.","The UFC goes to a fight card instead of the old tournament style, with boring results. With the fight card you can't root for your favorite fighter to go all the way and you get to see them only once the whole video. The super fight was a joke. Shamrock and Severn just walk around looking at each most of the match. This video is for the hard core fan only!"
4,politics,"Politics entered the fray in this UFC, with advised restrictions placed on fighters, which surfaced in the superfight. There are some good fights here, especially the impressive strength and skill of Don Frye, but the Shamrock-Severn re-match is painfully dull to watch as both fighters surround each other, almost afraid to fight."
1,More slapping than a 3 stooges film festival,"This video will make you think two things; 1.The U.F.C is a joke! 2.Larry, Curly, and Moe govern the state of michigan for making such stupid rules!"
1,the most exciting slap fight in history...hold on a second.,there is only two reasons to buy this video. schultz takedowns and bitteti's toughness. i was a little disappointed in frye however. this shows his lack of finishing skills. easily the worst ufc. unless you like watching two guys slap each other
2,whattsamatta you?,"The first bout-style UFC, with no tournament. Some fairly good fights, with Frye-Bitteti being the best. The superfight between Ken Shamrock and Dan Severn ranks in my top 3 'Worst Fights Ever'. Just pathetic. I'd advise you to stop the tape before it starts, but it's like a car-wreck; it's so horrible, you just have to watch. On the other hand, there's usually some blood at a good car-wreck."
3,Disappointing,"This UFC was rather dull. Most of the fights ended up with the fighters grappling on the ground for a few minutes. It lacked the intensity of past UFC matches. Also, there was no tournament, which also made it less exciting. The most exciting parts were the Frye/Bittiti fight and the sumo wrestler breaking his nose. The superfight was absolute boredom because Shamrock and Severn just circled each other the whole time. There are much better UFC video available"
2,A bit of a disappointment,"The idea of holding a ""fight-card"" was a good one, but this show was dead on arrival thanks to ""closed-fist"" rules that were forced in right before the event, and figures into Shamrock's horrible performance. The fights? Frazier/Worsham: Do you honestly care who wins this one? Next up, a massive BJJ fighter faces a ""warrior training"" practitioner, with predictable results. The Goodridge/Schultz fight was entertaining: big takedowns! Mark Hall faces a Sumo opponent: if you saw part 1 or 3 you can guess the outcome of that. Don Frye faces a BJJ man in the evening's best fight, although it is rather one sided. The superfight was a diaster: Shamrock should have broken the tacked-on rule and knocked that big goof out, but he decided to be ""Mr. Sportsmanship"" with disasterous results. This fight is hard to watch, although it is amusing to hear the annoncers try to call it! Overall, this one is only for a hardcore UFC fan."
1,Kindle version not recommended at all!!!,I guess travel guides are not suitable for kindle but anyway this book is so shallow that it does not seem to be DK/Eyewitness at all.My advice is get another book!!!
3,Good info but too heavy to carry around,"This was the only Berlin-specific guidebook I bought for a recent trip, but the heavy weight of the small book meant that I didn't carry it with me when out touring. I did use it to help me label and describe photos that I posted on-line when I returned, and I did try to visit the book's top 10 list. I would recommend it for reference, or for someone who doesn't mind a bit of extra weight when walking around all day."
5,Love It!!!!,This is a wonderful book. I own alot of books and I think this is one of my favorites.Ellen Dugan is wonderful
4,Cottage Witchery,"Another nicely written book by Ellen Dugan. Down to earth and whimsical, plus very informative at the same time. An enjoyable read all the way around."
2,Not a reference book,"If you do not have the garden books of Scott Cunningham, then this book may help you. Otherwise it only repeats what is already said. On the other hand it is easy to read, if you are looking for a bedtime book, well just order one."
2,Had Potential...,"This book started out strong and seemed to be exactly what I was looking for. I've been hoping for a book that focuses on the home, and ways to not only bring magic in, but also tips and ideas for decorating in a more magical way. The first few chapters seem to do exactly that - with detailed descriptions of what a witch's home could be, basic blessings, tips on finding the center of your home, etc. I was really excited! Unfortunately, soon after, the author committed the cardinal sin of many Wiccan titles: trying to do too much. She seemed to lose her focus, and the book becomes a mishmash of different ideas - protection, elemental work, feng shui, color magic, herbal magic, etc. Because she tries to cram so much in, she manages only to skim the surface of any of these areas - which means she gives information that has been given 1000 times elsewhere. I'm not new to magick, so I don't need the ""color magick 101"" course. I was hoping for more depth here, but it just wasn't there..."
5,Delighted with the Book,"I truly enjoyed this book. From the cutesy writing style to the suggestions on the methods of incorporating more natural objects in my decorating scheme. This book gave me lots of good ideas. My pagan bookclub read this book last month, and it was a hands down success, we all enjoyed it."
5,love it,"I got this book for myself and love the author's style of writing, very real and down to earth and full of useful info."
3,A fun read!,"I enjoyed the book very much! The author is full of fun ideas to bring magic and fun into each of our homes! Not only will you love her ideas, but the magical person inside of you will be inspired to create your own special ideas for your own unique ""cottage""!"
3,Gives enough,"I bought this book when I bought my first house. I was looking for something that could help bring a more magical feel to my home and help me protect it and bring to it all the things magic would. At first it seemed to do just that. I noticed in the beginning, in the ""about author"" part it says she's a garden expert. Halfway through the book she pretty much converts to gardening and plant stuff. I understand the garden and yards are part of the home but it seems to me she's stuck in only that world and I saw she already had a garden witch book so why really add that into this one? I got everything I wanted out of the book though and loved it. I just wish she could have done without all the little stories about her family. The fung shui kinda disappointed me, I don't really view that as the type of magic I like to follow and it was really out of place. Over all though the book is good for beginners of magic and informative on quite a bit."
5,As I Live and Breathe,This is the best book I have ever read. Dr Jamie Weisman is my Doctor and she is very dedicated to her patians. She has really done wonders for me. Everyone should read this book to see that they are not the only ones having problems
2,"Well-written, but has many weaknesses","Dr. Weisman's prose is extremely lucid, and the initial chapters held my interest. However, Dr. Weisman started to manifest her essential self-absorption in her penultimate chapter (""Begotten""). In the final chapter of this book (""Begetting""), Dr. Weisman includes an archaic and rather offensive discussion of the inherent inferiority of adoption,...Dr. Weisman is... not sufficiently experienced about life to attempt a credible book on suffering. Her chronic illness is really not that burdensome, and her whininess with respect to her initial infertility quickly becomes tiresome."
5,"Beautiful, Elegant, & Wise! A TERRIFIC MEMOIR!","I feel lucky to have been able to read this absolutely exquisite, yet at times gut wrenching, personal memoir, by a very gifted author who, it should be noted, is over twenty years younger than me. As one who has a very limited real life knowledge of medical life and death, it was an eye opener to (what sometimes seems) a completely different world. This is not only a sublime course in medical history and ethics, but a harrowing landscape of how the body can go wrong in myriad ways, and how the medical profession works its genius. The author has been through it from both sides too, and does not flinch in the telling. Not to be missed! Having read thousands of great books in nearly all fields, this is among the all-time best!"
2,I wish I could return it,"I had high hopes for this book. Good title, decent reviews.I have some basic sailing experience, so I expected to learn quite a lot, but to my surprise although the book has over 200 pagers, it is very basic and common sense information."
4,Great Biography,"I saw this A&E biography on its release back in 1998, and it is what made me become a huge Johnny Cash fan. This is a terrific DVD that was well put together and thorough in its research. Whether you are just curious about Johnny Cash or are already familiar with him I think this DVD is a great document of his life and is something that can be appreciated even after multiple viewings."
4,Johnny Cash Biography DVD,"Trying to fit Johnny Cash's life & career into 60 minutes left me wishing the program was longer. The interviews with sister, Louise, brother, Tommy, and daughter, Rosanne, added to the many clips of live performances and gave me a better insight to the megastar. He was a very special human being who gave his fans his all through his music."
3,Great while it lasts,"We've had five of the Oak Ridge circulating fans over the years. Unfortunately, they don't last more than two years before they slow down and then stop altogether. We have a pellet stove and I'm assuming that it's dust from the stove that gums it up (I'm not sure why because the fan is located about 25 feet from the stove). I can't find any way of disassembling the unit to clean/lube it. I've tried forced air and electrical contact cleaner and neither freed it up. Why have we bought 4-5 of them? All but one unit has been exceptionally quiet and they run great until they seize up. At $40 a pop, it's a little expensive, but we haven't found a quieter unit on the market. If we do, we'll see if it can hold up longer than the Oak Ridge. Our latest fan started slowing down the other night and now it has stopped altogether. NOTE: The one unit that was noisy still runs, so we usually use it until we buy a new one."
3,A good start,"This book is a good starting place for people like me who are looking to permanently leave where they currently live but are not sure how to go about finding a ""better"" place.My only criticism is that I thought the book would be a little bit more thorough, although given the retail price, I think it's a good value.Missing is some basic information, such as state laws regarding gays (there is some local information which is helpful). For instance, they don't bother to tell you when recommending the Atlanta area that Georgia doesn't even have anti-discrimination laws for sexual orientation. While local laws may protect you, if you get to the state supreme court, you won't have a chance.All in all, though, a useful little book. Perhaps their next edition will be a expanded to include more details."
3,Nice to have.,"A book like this is good and I found new information. However, a book like this should be a bit more informative instead of just statisticalinformation that changes so quickly."
4,I choose Austin!,This book went into pretty good detail of the listed cities. I hope there is an updated version soon. It was published in 2005.
1,"Out of date, contains errors, and is politically slanted","Book is now years out of date. Thumbnail sketches don't provide much detail, and I caught a number of errors in the first quick run-through (for example, San Antonio is south of Austin, not north as the author claims), and Palm Springs, being in the desert, doesn't have anywhere near 69% humidity in July (6.9% would be more like it). The author also picks typical liberal (or as he refers to them, ""progressive"") towns like Ithaca, Burlington and Madison, and nearly every suburb of Washington DC he could find. In this book, ""urban planning"" is always good, cars are bad, and ""progressives"" are desirable. Well, this Libertarian objects."
1,"buyer beware, an agenda driven book","This book is a bunch of, written by an ill informed revisionist. The amazon review program forced me to rate this book with a star. I had to give it at least one star, and it is one star too many."
1,disgusting,"I grew up with many Holocaust survivors and their children. I have been told as well as read that some prisoners were forced to see their naked loved ones on line to the gas chambers. And if you say gas wasn't used then why did the nazi's have so muchZyklon-B gas available and why at the Nurenberg trails did some Nazi's go into much detail about the gas chambers and associatedovens? It is this author, who has his feet made of clay. To show Hilberg may have not proven much in the form of a mathematical theoremhas no bearing on what happened at the death camps. What happened happened! And I am sure this ""charming"" author has an enormous amount of pleasure in arguing for the sake of arguing. He is a self-serving attention seeker who doesn't deserve any attention at all."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS,"I wish someone else had written a review for this product, so that I didnt waste my money. Totally unsuitable for children. The artist performing the songs is listless and has no energy. The speed of the songs is too fast for children to follow, almost looks like the artist just wants to get them done and get out of there. Even the words of the songs are very badly articulated, so it is difficult for toddlers to understand. There is no animation, no energy, nothing. Total waste of your money. I am giving this one star, cos I dont know how to give it any less than that. If there were a way to give minus stars, I would"
5,great experience,everything was packaged nicely and securely together. My book also was received on time if not before. great experience-will buy from again.
5,An excellent book,"I really liked this book when I got it from the library. I would recommend it to anyone who is learning to make their own baby food, or trying to entice a toddler to eat. It has step by step instructions, and beautiful illustrations. My three year old looks at it, points to the pictures and says, ""Yummy, Mommy, yummy!"" I haven't had a chance to try the recipes yet, but most of them look pretty good and include the whole family, from baby to parents. In the latter half of the book, it shows you how to prepare a meal, when to take out portions for the baby and younger child, and how to season and present the dishes for different members of the family, which I found useful because I like to have every step written out to make sure I don't leave out a step. There is also a dessert section! Yummy, mommy, yummy! :)"
2,Where was the editor???,"Plot is great, writing is fair but the typos and errors in grammer are a disgrace."
5,Four Book Series Has It All!,"Well, it seems to me this writer has left nothing out. The Lambert series of four seems to have all the ingredients needed to entertain the reader for hours on end. I like that in the books I read. Action, romance, intrigue, secrets, skeletons, and of course a double murder mystery to solve. I like this new writer and look forward to buying and reading her next novel of love, lust, passion and suspense."
4,"From beginning to end,",I ENJOYED THIS BOOK! I really get into books that read like soap operas. A little mystery and a lot of romance. A great way to spend an afternoon! I look forward to another story in this series.
5,Book-Two in the Lambert series rocks!,"FORBIDDEN is the 2nd book in Ms. Murray's Lambert series...an on-going soap opera type read that rocks! The characters are wonderful (good, bad, and the ugly) and the dialogue is refreshing and anything but boring, and the plot just keeps getting better and better. I am hopelessly hooked on this series and look forward to completing the last two- books."
4,Better and Better,"I most appreciate Victoria's imagination for a story and all of the hard work that went into writing a four book series. Who could do that? ""Forbidden"" is the continuation of book one, ""Thief of Hearts."" Like any good mystery, in this second installment of the Lambert series, the plot thickens.Other reviewers have told you what this is about. I won't but will say that Victory Murray has the heart and soul of a good, someday to be great, writer. Keep your eye on her. Give ""Forbidden"" a try."
5,This Writer Has A Wonderful Imagination!,This writer has a wonderful and whitty style. I like it...I like it a lot! Look forward to the next book in the series.
5,An island paradise like no other!,"I picked this book up in a beauty shop I go to a couple of times a week and began reading it as I was under the hair dryer and I literally did not want to stop reading the story, it was that exciting! I asked the beautician if I could take the book home with me and bring it back on my next visit she laughed at me and told me everyone of her customers that start reading Forbidden by Victoria Murray would ask her the same thing. As it turned out I had to order my own copy from Amazon because there were too many people ahead of me waiting in line to read it at the beauty shop. While I was at it I went ahead and ordered the other 3 books in this ""MUST READ"" series. I can hardly wait until the books arrive! If you like your romantic/suspense steamy then this is one series you owe it to yourself to read!"
1,No good,"I just finished reading this book and in the trash it went. I can't believe there is more to this ""series"". Is this a joke? Stick-figure character, stick-figure plot, stick-figure storyline. Too many characters and twice as many trite sex scenes. The typographical errors cap off the fact that the story is just plain no good."
4,A stay at home and cozy up to a good book kind've read...,"You know I really like the LAMBERT SERIES by Victoria Murray. Tons of characters constantly taking shape and the plot is both mysterious and sexy at the same time. So many characters to either like or dislike and the dialogue is fun and easy to get lost in. I am luckier than most people because I have had the pleasure of reading advance copies of the whole 4 bk. series and all I can say is each eposide is better than the one before. The final book in the series, ""Le Fin"" is my favorite and believe me it is well worth the wait it has an ending that will surprise everyone. Very entertaining! Now that The Lambert Series has ended I find myself excitedly waiting for this author's next novel, also a Murder Mystery, ""Exposure Behind Closed Doors."" From the synopsis of it this book should prove as exciting as The Lambert Series, but unlike this writer's last four books, her newest novel stands on its own as a one book deal. I can hardly wait!"
5,"talk about one earth shattering week in someone's life,",The Lambert series by Victoria Murray has got to be one of the most fun misadventures ever! Following Nouri Sommers as she lives her life on the edge from chapter to chapter and book to book has been a whirlwind roller-coaster for me to keep up with. Even when I stop reading for the night and force myself to put the book down I still found myself re-playing (over and over) in my mind the few chapters that I had just finished reading. I can hardly wait to see what is in store for me with book 3 of this fun series!
5,Turn up the volume!,A fresh new writer and a fresh new romantic suspense series is sweeping the country and I am loving it. A fun book with fun characters and a fun read you will lose yourself in. Great weekend read!
5,"Interesting Plot,","I enjoy romance novels that have a subplot mystery like, FORBIDDEN. I like this writer and so far I like her romantic mystery soap opera. A friend gave me the first two books in this series and I had a lot of fun reading them. I just ordered the last two books and look forward to reading them too."
1,A waste of time,"This is one of the worst books I have read in a very long time. I read the reviews and the number of stars given and felt as if it would be a good choice. It is so poorly written, edited and an insult to anyone (especially women) at which it seems to be targeted. I am not a writer, but I could sit down tomorrow and compose a much more interesting story than this - plus, it would not insult anyone's intelligence. As I stated, this book and author is a waste of time and money."
4,Cute Story...,"I thought the on-going story in ""The Lambert Series"" shows a lot of promise. I like stories in the series 'type' books as a rule and so far have not been let down after reading all the books used in the creation of the one 'final' story leading up to the 'final outcome'in most of the books I have read. (I think I said that correctly!) Anyway, The Lambert Series by Victoria Murray seems to me like the final book should be very exciting. I have decided to go along for the (4) book ride and see where it takes me. So far, I have had a great ride with the series. I think you might enjoy coming along for the ride as well. Book-2 of this series ""Forbidden"" takes the reader deeper into the the very private life of a young billionairess by the name of Nouri Sommers."
5,Splendid Story!,If you like your romantic suspense stories sexy and mysterious then the Lambert series by Victoria Taylor Murray is the four book series to read. I have had the pleasure of reading the series in its proper order and I found all four books sexy and exciting and with just the right mix of mystery. I think most of Ms. Murray's readers will feel the same way after reading her wonderful story to conclusion. Highly Recommended!
5,better and better and better still...,I am having a super time connecting the four book Lambert series. Can't wait for the next installment to arrive.
5,This series has it all !!,The Lambert Series has something for anyone that is into wild soap operas! The characters are diverse and the storyline kept me glued to my seat until after I had finished the entire 4-bk series. I hope Ms. Murray has another series in mind (real soon) for us (her die-hard Lambert fans!)
4,Clever and Interesting Soap Opera!,I liked this book a lot better than the first so much in fact I am excited about ordering the third of the series. I've become a LAMBERT fan!
1,awful - do not waste your time or money!,"poorly written and ridiculous - if I could, I would get my money back! I feel manipulated, because I'm pretty sure there were 5 star ratings on this book. Obviously not from anyone that read the book or anyone with more than a 3rd grade education."
1,What is grammar?,"This book is so chocked full of grammatical, typographical and punctuation errors that I found myself re-reading just to figure out what I was reading. Example: ""... when she wrapped those long legs around your waste ..."" Then, there is the excessive use of descriptive character names instead of actual character names. Examples: ""female detective's sexy body"", ""high powered attorney"", etc. I found myself unable to identify with the character's name or form my own mental image of the character. I won't read another book by Victoria Taylor Murray...."
4,Look at the Human question,"This book is apolitical. It is not about blame. Instead it points out the horridness of modern war where civilians make up the largest causality figures. Ibuse brilliantly and subtly weaves together the stories of Hiroshima to point this out. Ibuse forces us to see the cruelty of political ideologies. These same ideologies cause some reviewers to demonize the US, and others to blame the charred bodies of the victims of Hiroshima. The morality of the bombing of Hiroshima is not the question, the morality of war is. . ."
2,Boring book,Not a good read for me. I don't enjoy reading so it takes a good book to keep my attention and I struggled to make it through this book. Some parts were good and then other parts just seemed to lose you.
5,GREAT BOOK FOR BOWLERS WITH LEAGUE EXPERIENCE,because the subjects discussed will be of interest to bowlers with competitive experience. I found this book well organized and very detailed with EMPHASIS notedthrough-out book to indicate the MUST-DO techniques if you expect results to be had from practicing Jowdy's straight-forward thoughts on a lifetime of teaching and observing bowlers.....JOWDY has the answer to being a consistent bowler....the first thing you must do to improve is believe what he says and make the change....I found it strange but the feeling and the results have me understanding my reasons for not being consistent during league play previously.
3,Useful but not encyclopedic.,"""Bowling Execution"" is a useful book to study, AFTER one has absorbed Tom Kouros' ""Par Bowling: The Challenge."" In effect, ""Bowling Execution"" reminds one to pay particular attention to some key aspects of execution, while ""Par Bowling"" explains those aspects and many others in great detail. In my case, the advice that was of particular value was to begin one's approach as soon as one is comfortably positioned in the stance (since delaying beyond that time tends to result in becoming tensed up, preventing a free, fluid execution of the approach and delivery)."
1,NOT recommended for beginners OR experienced bowlers,"I should have listened to the bad reviews of this book. But, as a librarian, I trusted this publisher as well-known in the sports fields and wanted to improve my personal game. This book is terrible. It is poorly organized and poorly written. As a bowler with over 40 years' experience, even I did not understand most of the jargon. The ""technique"" descriptions (grip, stance, target, etc.) did nothing to explain how to implement or execute the technique - and the accompanying images didn't help a single bit. In fact, the whole book seemed like nothing more than a vehicle for the author to drop the names of pro bowlers. Don't purchase this book."
2,Everything you shouldn't know.,"Unfortunatly this book is very misleading. He often makes statements that go something like this..... Normally you would never use this kind of method and I would avoid it in most circumstances, but this one pro does it all the time, and so does this other guy. He then goes rambling on about all these different things that he just said you should never do and often leaves the basic concept he was addressing with a meager 4 sentences. We all get the idea that bowling involves your own litte variations, but its always based on a solid set of fundementals. I just wish he would have spent more time on the basics then the rare fundamental opposites."
2,The Sample is a JOKE,"I hate girls, who show you ""only"" their beautiful eyes but not the 200-pound torso concealed behind it. This book reminds me of that. I cannot make up my mind out of these 3 or so pages in the sample, so Mr Publisher, I AM NOT going to buy it. Choke!"
1,Biased in every way,"What I really didn't like about this book is the constant rambling after starting the topic sentence in a paragraph. Which never concluded any information on the topic. Then instead of going over all the variations of an approach, he makes it quite clear that this should be the method for every bowler. In my opinion bowling involves individuals, and on mans view will not work for every bowler. It would be more helpful if he used his insight in bowling on how to work with the different variations that you can see in bowling."
1,Broke on me within 30 seconds,"I would advise anyone aganist buying this product. I bought it as a birthday gift for my father. I went to his house to set it up while he was gone and was going to test it out before I left. I got in the hammock and laid there for about 10 when one of the links in the chain broke causing me to fall over a foot onto the concrete patio below on my back. If you look at the picutres, there's a metal bar running across the middle that I fell on as well. Calling Texsport only offered to send me a new chain. I don't expect to be sent all kinds of money for it, but I don't think just sending me a new chain makes it right. This is not a product I feel I can trust."
2,Good while it lasts,"I bought this hammock for my mom for Christmas in 2007 and by the summer of 2008 the rope deteriorated and fell apart. Everything about it was great except for the poor durability of the strings. We live in Texas where it doesn't rain that often, but regardless, don't plan on leaving this hammock outside, uncovered."
3,Nice Hammock and Stand,"I just received the hammock and stand. Overall, the quality is good. Until the hammock stretches out a bit, it is unstable and will roll you out. We just tied the ends down to keep it from rolling until it stretched out. the stand is very stable and of good thickness. the only negative is that the stand pieces are not held in place other than gravity and friction. We drilled holes and bolted the pieces into place."
4,The Day The Fifth Grade Disappeared,It was a very interesting mystery story. I couldn't really put it down after starting it. I recommend the book to all.
4,One Napoleon Dynamite Keychain= One Happy Cousin! haha!,"I have a cousin who is a little odd or unique. We watched the Napoleon Dynamite movie together and he really liked the movie. So I was very happy to have been given some Gift Ideas for him. I know he'll like his keychain and I'm very excited to give it to him when Christmas rolls around.The only problem with the toy was that it said that Batteries WERE included. So when I got the product, I opened it to try it out and the batteries were DEAD.So, I had a heck of a time finding new batteries and opening the battery plate. (in the end I used a mini screwdriver from a Glasses Repair case that I had bought at a dollar store)Once the batteries were replaced, the sound was great and everything worked fine!So if you or someone you know is a Napoleon Dynamite fan, this is a worthwhile purchase....when it's all said and done, I might have to come back and order one for myself! hahaha!"
4,Gosh! It's fun but not very loud.,"This has all Napoleon's cool sayings from the movie. My favorite is ""I like your sleeves. They're real big"". But the fidelity isn't the greatest. Instead of Gosh! it sounds like Kosh! Also, the sound level is very low. You wouldn't want to try to use this at a party unless it was a slumber party because you have to be in a quiet location in order to hear and understand the sayings. Compared to this one my Mr. T In Your Pocket talking keychain sounds like a PA system. But, it is still fun so I gave it 4 out of 5 stars."
1,Napoleon Dynamite Wasn't A Talking Keychain,This item was poorly made and only one of the six keys worked. I contacted the company on the day it arrived to try and get a replacement. They ignored my email. I will not be purchasing anything from this company again!
5,"Thid edition rules, first edition feel!",Ah just fliping through this will bring back memories of late night gaming and pizza! Surely even Gary gyrax would agree a torch has been passed! Buy it and see!
3,not falling far,"Terrible quailty camerawork? Bad, stilted acting, Not even a B movie. BUT, the story is actually good for its kind. It is a clear, good Angels vs Lucifer and his buddies with the earth in the balance. Its been done before and with alot more money put into the project. It has been done with much better special effects and acting. Storywise it is a good as some of the more expensive of it kind. So if you know that in advance and like the topic and get if free on Amazon Prime like I did it is time not badly spent. Do not think I would have felt the same if I had paid 5 dollars for it. But for free or 99 cents its not bad"
3,Intermediate,"If you know what poses to do, then the video might be helpful- however, if you are even somewhat unfamiliar with the names of the poses, you are in trouble-- the poses themselves make it hard to see the TV for an explanation of the pose, and they give little instruction."
2,Too fast for me!,I wouldn't recommend this tape to others. The pace is too fast and the routine repeats itself to much making it boring at times. I did the tape once and doubt I will use it again!
4,GREAT COMPACT YOGA TAPE!,"This a great ""power yoga"" tape. In 45 minutes you work and stretch from head to toe. Wears the brand of Bryan Kests' series (he created the program) this is perfect for days when time is short."
5,pretty little thing,"This Chai is very pretty and isn't flimsy, chain is sturdy and had good length. I bought this for my mom for Chanuka last year."
5,Worth buying for just one piece!,"I heard the last half of just one piece on this album, and that alone is why I am buying it. I was listening to the classical station on my car radio and was delighting in hearing what sounded to me like a bassoon concerto by Rossini. It had all the fun of a Rossini overture, but in the form of a theme and variations for soloist and orchestra. Did Rossini even write a bassoon concerto? I thought I am going to have to get this! I listened to end and the disc jockey announced that the piece was the Capriccio for bassoon and orchestra by Verdi! I was surprised, but this is early, but not confirmed, Verdi when he was influenced by Rossini."
4,A lot about organizational behavior,"A textbook approach to globalization, however, much of what is found in the book is based largely on organizational theory. Probably a good all around book for the person without a background in that discipline or area of study."
2,Stories good but condition of book bad,"The reading material is very good and merits a 5 star but the condition of the book was terrible even though when I bought it, it was advertised as in good condition."
1,Read the Reviews Before You Buy,"I bought this book at full price, (NOT FROM AMAZON) and that is why I am here now. ...a lot of the directions are hard to follow and the author seems to want you to intuitively feel your way into how to make mail.I've read better directions on the web.Pass on this one and save your money to buy Brian Price's book....it will give you more insight into how armor is made to SCA standards."
2,much better information on the web,"I received this book as a gift from a friend who wouldnt know any better, but words of caution for anyone looking to buy this: there is much better info on the web. Aside from the incongruent terminology, blurry pictures (probably swiped from the web) and convoluted instructions, it instructs you to use the pincing kind of clippers rather than the shearing kind. The pincing clippers give you link joints that dont meet, creating mail that sometimes won't even stand up to costume wear. She also uses unusually thick wire for my tastes. The only good part is ith glove patterns, though i have yet to try them my self, they seem thought through enugh. Take my advice, look on the web, there are many more comprehensive guides out there than this book."
1,Disappointment,"This CD begins with 3 tracks of a person speaking while music plays in the background. There is something wrong with the voice as it shivers as if a needle were skipping, plus the music is at the same volume so it is very hard to understand. The 4th track is the rainfall. If you want to fall asleep to your CD, you have to set the track each time. And if your player, like mine, is your alarm, then you wake up to the eerie voice."
4,seems to be a good review book,haven't gone through the book completely. It seems to be a really good review book though.
2,Motorola H 700 bluetooth,Bought two and neither one works well with my blackberry. Volume problems on both ends.
5,Wireless Bluetooth Gold,My son is very pleased with this product. He had no problem setting it up. A great Christmas present for him. I'll feel better about him driving now with his cell phone.
2,Sn√≥ozf√©st,"Agaetis Byrjun, Sigur R√≥s's last cd, could lull you to sleep. This one, whatever it's called, could put you to sleep."
2,make it stop,"I really wanted to like this. I heard so many good things about this band that I was really curious to see what all the hype was about. But for the same reasons that I completely hate jazz, I hate this as well: it is completely pompus B.S. It resembles something that belongs in my grandmothers collection than mine. Complete elevator music. Boring."
2,blah,"Doesn't come close to the last album. They tried to use the same formula that madethe last album so successful but in the end just made a mess. Ive listened to this cd 50times now and can't remember a single song from it. Perhaps leaving the tracksuntitled was not a good idea either. In an attempt to be artsy, they left out oneimportant ingredient, good music."
2,Forgot that I was listening to it,Twice I've sat all the way through this album and twice I've forgotten that I was listening to anything. I gave it three stars because there is maybe one good moment: I momentarily perked up during track 4.How could they have so soon forgotten how to make a great album? Everything that makes Agaetis Byrjun so fantastic is nowhere to be found. Even when they try to make the music soar you don't go with it; you're just left sitting there wishing they would get it over with.
2,Don't get it,"I don't get it...Agaetis Byrjun was a beautiful masterpiece. This album just puts me to sleep except for a few gems...what went wrong?! Buy any GSYBE or even Mogwai's newest one, which, though rather repeative, is far more interesting than this album. Sigar Ros, please go back to the dynamic changes you left behind with Agaetis Byrjun, PLEASE! I'd like to blame it on the music industry, but i just don't know...maybe this album will grow on me, but so far; every listen just disappoints me... I really enjoy post rock, but this just feels like a drunken Enya."
5,the best thing my ears have ever heard,"I have never heard a cd as beautiful as this. I have also never heard a voice as intreging and as hypnotic as Jonsi's. It simply carries you off the ground into a place you've never been before. A place not quite like anywhere on this planet. It simply moves you beyond belief.Another thing that stands out is how their is nothing on the cover or inside the book. This cd is simply about one thing. THE MUSIC. And they succede very well and making music like no other band on this planet.Standout songs: 1,3,4,6,8."
3,A good CD to fall asleep to.,"I have been blown away by Sigur Ros before, but () doesn't do it. The CD has a pleasant sonic texture, but it never rises above pleasant. The album inset is fitting: page after page of somewhat pretty photos of the same nothing in particular."
2,Shapeless,"Tweedle dee, tweedle dum...there's nothing but blank space between those two parentheses. I found the whole thing to be pretty unmemorable, and although it's good to see the hype machine settling down on a band that's willing to push the musical envelope, the music on ( ) seems to drift in one ear and out the other, like a parody of their previous album. There's no 'there' there, just a dull, endless ocean full of toothless fish. After a start-to-finish headphone session I had to jump start my consciousness with some Mogwai and Bardo Pond just to be sure my synapses were firing correctly. They were, and this disc was filed in the 'sweet nothings' slushpile, to be resurrected when I enter the old folks' home."
5,Amazing,"The entire album is one long, beautifully flowing epic. Sigur Ros is one of the few truly unique bands to come around in recent years. Their music is very mellow and soothing. Wonderful background for anything. I would recommend this album to anyone looking for something different and intelligent."
5,Excellent,The idea that these brilliant artists are anything less than God's gift to the otherwise nearly dead genre of decent music would leave anyone who has heard their work aghast. These people raise the bar for all musicians who have heard their work.
5,Track 8,"Thats all I have to say. Buy this CD and listen to the whole thing, but pay close attention to track 8. I believe its the most beautiful song I have ever heard. The whole CD is incredible, but track 8 is worth the price of 50 CDs."
5,its like the music i keep hearing when i dream,its an eerie background music in the car that seems to go with just about any phase. good listening. gotta try.
2,A little doesn't float very far,"Not really, not this time around. Yes, Sigur Ros has an absolutley crucial sound but they no longer know what to do with it. I think the time will come when they are acknowledged to have been quickly overrated. And the lead singer just doesn't want to let go when he gets ahold of an irritating refrain...on and on and on........."
3,bills review,"I purchased and listened to this CD with high expectations and was somewhat disappointed. The music is somewhere between ambient and Pink Floydian and is not without merit, but the tortureously repetitive vocalized verse that repeats through THE ENTIRE CD, is excruciating to listen to. I am not a stranger to the ambient genre and realize that repetiveness can lend itself to the trance which can be entirely pleasurable, but in this CDs case, the single repetitive vocalized line over and over again is overwhelming. I would recommend passing on this CD but this does not come easy for me to say because I wanted to like it and do certainly like the music but taken as a whole, well, sorry folks."
5,[untitled],"Sigur Ros has created one of the most beautiful albums I have ever heard, stripping practically everything away but the music itself.As many people have stated before, there are no liner notes, not really an album name, no song names, just the music itself, a couple of pictures, and the name Sigur Ros.I cannot describe the beauty, and it would take the smartest people YEARS to decipher the words, since they are gibberish (Hopelandic).It is something that must be experienced to believe."
5,Floating through the Milky Way...,"This c.d. has less commercial appeal than Agaetis Byrjun, I think. It tends to be darker and more repetetive. More intense. Yeah, the singer sounds like he's repeating the same few words over and over again, but hey, it makes it easier to sing along (I DO find my self singing along, if you can imagine such a thing). Like A.B., I love every track on this one, too. Tracks 2, 4, 5, and 8 stand out for me in particular. ( ) reminds me of watching the night sky, for some reason. It is heavenly music, but in a different way from A.B. I play this one almost every night, as I'm hanging out, reading, before bed. I don't think I've ever heard it during daylight hours - it's that kind of c.d. Also like A.B., this is great f**king music! Try it:)"
3,Agaetis Byrjun was the better album,"I agree that Sigur Ros sounds like a raw version of many of the old 4AD bands (This Mortal Coil, Cocteau Twins, etc.). I love those bands which is what attracted me to Sigur Ros. Agaetis Byrjun was a great album, but I can't help but feel disappointed in (). I think the high pitched whale sounds (or whatever they are) on Track 1 are rather silly. Even though I love tracks 4, 6, and 8, I can't help but feel that a lot of the tracks are SO repetive. Another comment: the Cocteau Twins did an amazing job of singing in their own language, but Sigur Ros seems like they lack imagination in this department. Sometimes I think I'm listening to an autistic Rain Man edition of some of the tracks. I still appreciate what Sigur Ros is trying to do and will continue to support them with my hard earned cash. I just hope that the future is brighter than this."
2,carpe diem,"I'm giving this album a low rating because of the nasty surpise I discovered on this disc. While the music is as excelent as always the disc I purchased has a special copy prevention feature that prevents it from bring played on a computer. If you intend to listen to this on a stereo system, then by all means buy it and enjoy. If however, you plan to listen to this on a computer (for whatever reason), save your money and don't buy it. It won't play at all on a MAC and the sound quality in Windows is at such a reduced level that it sounds worse than some 15 year old analog tapes I have."
4,pretty dope...,"But not as good as the last one. The sound is a lot more spare, not so massive and enveloping. They sound a little more like mogwai on this disc. A lot more subtlety, and the tracks sort of blend together. Overall, this is still sigur ros (how do you pronounce that?) so it is pretty awesome. I like the fact that they didn't name the tracks or cd."
2,"I tried, I really did.","I tried to get down to this, hoping the hype was deserved. But all of these nameless tracks do nothing for me. It also doesn't help that the album's lyrics consist of 4 syllables repeated. If you are going to make up the language, at least make it sound good. I guess if I want epic wordless ""rock"", I'll have to stick to GY!BE. Buy one of their albums to hear how its done, without gibberish and all this pretentious blank packaging."
5,Look at pictures of your family with Untitled 3 playing...,Untitled 3 was the first Sigur Ros song I ever heard. My brother used it as the background music on a video he prepared to propose to his girlfriend. I had heard my two brothers talk about Sigur Ros for years but never decided to investigate on my own. Untitled 3 changed all of that. After hearting Untitled 3 I bought ( ) and I have been forever grateful. You don't have a heart if you don't like this musical masterpiece. I still can't believe music can be this good...
4,EXQUISITE MOOD PIECE,"I fell in love with the subwoofer-trembling echoes of ""Agaetis byrjun"", but this complilation sounds introverted and contained, somber and complete; a marvel of music. Imagine a thick but tingling organ, Birgisson's near-whistling vocals, piano on one side, and wisps of synth on the other...most bands can only sound this graceful by whispering, or feigning delicacy. Sigur musters the effect with an iron fist, every detail aggressively beautiful. You need good speakers to listen to this music, not to mention a good non-pop appetite. Delectable!"
2,A huge step down for Sigur Ros: emotionless,"I thought their last two releases comprised some of the most beautiful, fresh, progressive, emotional music in the last few years. But this recording is a big step down. You know how much you love the Nothing Song, and appreciate the live versions you download through file sharing? Well, here the version lacks any of the pathos, any of the despairing urgency. Rather, all of the songs on this album homogenously blend together in a kind of self-loving soup. As we hear the same couple of words repeated over and over, the music never goes anywhere, and its one groove isn't particularly profound or heart-rending. Rather than moving and fresh --as their last two albums-- the listener is now left feeling the lead singer is some really pretentious guy singing in the shower. Self-love and complacency come across here, rather than the pensiveness and raw, quiet emotions that made them great."
2,"u sigh, u sigh, u sigh, u sigh, u sigh, u sigh, u sigh","I hope this album is not an indication that Sigur Ros have already peaked, but Agaetis Byrjunwas a LOT better. I really like Sigur Ros, and I really tried to like this album, but I don't (very much). Sounds like they've run out of steam musically. And repeating the same (made up) lyric throughout the whole album? Even when relieved of the constraint that lyrics need to make sense, the best they could come up with was ""u sigh"" (repeat ad nauseum). Agaetis Byrjun had heart, () sounds like they want to be Godspeed You Black Emperor. And failed."
5,ICELAND AND SCANDINAVIA ROCK!!!!,"A beautiful album! If you really want to enjoy Sigur R√≥s, see them play live. I saw them play with Bj√∂rk this past summer in New York and they were awesome. Probably the best concert of my life!"
2,What is this?,"I'm sorry to disagree with some of these 5 star reviews this is getting. Everytime I hear one of their songs, I worry about that friend of mine that cuts her wrists just to feel the pain. This sounds like something I would be afraid to play near an old folks home because the tennants would think it's time to go to the next life. If you're really into the low-key, lets just sit and veg out on mind numbing dark vibes, GO FOR IT. If not, skip it. Listen to your friends copy before you go jumping on it."
1,need to be in the right mood for this CD,"I like this CD in small doses. But it can be very grating when the lead singer repeats nonsense words (they don't mean anything in Icelandic for those who don't know) over and over again, or when he moans. But the music is so idiosyncratic anyway that knocking it for the moaning is pointless perphaps. At its best, Sugur Ros is a 21st Century Cocteau twins with more discordance and less melody. I prefer Cocteau twins"
1,Quaaludes finally arrive in Iceland,"Reading good reviews of this band led me to seek out some of their music. I've concluded this is one of those bands who owe their success to the tragically hip music fan who gravitates towards artists whose music is so pretentious and unfathomable that most people reject it, hence, their popularity. These are the people who think Pink Floyd sold out after Syd Barrett left. It reminds me of when I was forced to sit through a set of White Stripes at a festival show. Looking around at their supposed fans, most of what I saw was boredom. But I also got a sense that no one was willing to be the first to say ""Jeez, these people really suck."" A modern version of ""The Emperor's New Clothes."" The only suggestion I would make to Sigur Ros is, when recording vocals, it would be better to place the microphone in the same room as the singer."
2,A Waste Of Talent,"I hate to say it but, although they are very talented and write some great music, especially instrumentally speaking, Sigur Ros ruin it all with smarmy, pretentious, overdramatic, and feminine sounding vocals. The music is hard to take seriously with that terrible crooning all over the place. At least it's all gibberish and you can't understand what he's saying. Either they should go instrumental or find a woman if they want feminine vocals. I still dig the distorted bowed guitar sounds. Listen to Mum instead."
3,What!?!??!?,It's okay music. I'll start by saying that. But why are these guys being heralded as the saviors of rock?Come to think about it... is this even rock at all?
3,It was dumb to think...,"...that Sigur Ros could ever top their untouchable masterpiece ""Agaetis Byrjun"". While this album isn't a complete wreck, it still pales in comparison to their sophomore album. What I found was lacking in this album was not just song names, or even an actual title, but the roller-coaster of emotions found in ""AB"". Everytime I heard this album, it just melted away in a 72-minute long bland daze, with no discernible melodies and the same 15 syllables (curiously alike to the ones used in ""AB"") repeated over and over in Hopelandish.Every now and then I listen to it to try to salvage it, and there is no doubt that it is a pretty album, but it's just too pretty. Stick with ""Agaetis Byrjun"", you can't go wrong with it."
3,"Beautiful, drowsy and monotonous","The music on this album is very beautiful. However, most of the untitled 'songs' flow together and sound very similar. There is definately not much variety on this album. The sounds, voices, and tempo remain consistent throughout the entire disc, making it perfect fall asleep/background music."
5,Seraphic,"Never before have I encountered an album that not only intrigues me, but enlightens me as well. Sigur Ros's (), allows one to step outside of the physical reality, and places them into the metaphysical realm. Listening to the beginning tracks I found myself closing my eyes recollecting those days that have long since past, and excepting them for what effects they had on my life. If, and when, I go to heaven I envision the cherubins softly chanting the ""lyrics"" of Sigur Ros to the masses and reassuring one's spirit that all is well, welcoming them to eternal bliss. This album takes one on a journey to spiritual awakening and the to embracement of humanity. Some may say that this is a grandious compliment to Sigur Ros, but listen to this album for yourself, and be asured that your world will be changed for the better."
3,It's a good cd if your in the mood,"If you are in the mood to be lulled by beautiful, slow songs that feel more like a constant ""drone"" overwhelming you with emotion then you should try these guys out. As far as musicianship goes, I wouldn't give these guys too much praise but the originality of their material is what matters. Most songs are rather long and never go anywhere. The same drum pattern stays constant in one song, for the entire 9 minutes! It is gorgeous music, don't get me wrong. If you want to be relaxed and whisked away into your dreams then this is a great cd. I made the mistake of listening to it while I was driving!! bad idea..but buying this cd is a good idea."
4,Set the controls for the heart of ... Iceland?,"The material on this CD is some of thier sparser, slower-tempo, morose, moody, darker material compared to, say, Takk. As such, this CD requires a few more listens to get under your skin. Some of the tracks, such as four, and eight, have a prog- space-rock vibe going, languishing at a slow burn, evocative of early-seventies Pink Floyd or OK Computer/Kid A -era Radiohead.This CD does lack the warmth and emotion, again, found on Takk, but if you prefer atmosphere and mystery, then this album has lots of it."
5,Music as an artform,"It seems that Sigur R√≥s has found out what music can be if you love it enough. Their love of music and the different manners in which it can be made has made ( ) an album of sheer artistic beauty. It's strange how the band can record this album in a swimming pool, play their guitars with bows and make up a launguage to sing and yet still be so understated. This album is hard to discribe, it's like classical music made with rock instruments and it turns out to be a painting of a wintery lanscape that is utterly capitivating and deeply moving. With Agaetis Sigur R√≥s proved that they were amazing at song construction and brilliant musicians, with ( ) they take siplicity and prove that it can be more powerful than anything else. I probably haven't helped much but take it from me this is definately an album you want to own. It will take you places you didn't think still existed"
3,Mike McGonigal sucks,"The ""two Sausages kissing remark is inane"", Mike. Grow out of your 20-year-old, hipper-then-thou smarminess and try to play an instrument for a decade or two then try and get a record produced and distributed for a fan base that does not seek to rule the world with banal quips and Saturday night pedantry.The album is not great. 70s prog rock is musician-music. White Stripes suck. Go back to the tavern for another thought-provoking session of Guiness, mate, and leave the music reviews to people a little less insipid."
1,Not Even Mediocre,"This album is not even mediocre- it's simply bad. After about three songs I just couldn't take it anymore. The high pitched distorted voices in the background have the same disturbing effect as a mosquito buzzing in your ear. The melodies are very plane and lack sophistication. It almost sounds like a child toying with a piano, repetitively playing the same four random keys. Don't buy it."
3,Doesn't fulfill the promise of Agaetis Byrjun,"I like Sigur Ros. That being said, I feel they have so much more to offer than they're giving us. These minimalist ""soundscapes"" can be very rewarding with repeated listens, however 3 songs through the record and you're not sure anything has happened yet. It also seems to me as a regression of sorts from their previously megahyped ""Agaetis Byrjun"", which was more rewarding overall and a bit more fleshed out, soundwise. I will enjoy this record for what it is, realizing that this band hasn't even begun to tap their overall potential, while at the same time wondering ""what if""... Kevin Shields had produced this record."
5,Words Can't Describe,"While ( ) is a much darker and slower affair than their A.B., it is a gorgeous, emotional, sad, and incredible work of music. ( ) might take some time to sink in, but when it does, you'll sit still in a state of awe. Jon's amazing voice and bowed guitar are used to amazing effect, while the 1st, 4th, and 8th tracks are beyond description. I can't really say much else.A few misc. points: 1. Their new material that they've been performing in concert is incredible (especially ""Gong""); 2. If you get a chance, see them in concert. What they do to the 8th track on ( ) is brilliant."
5,SOUNDTRACK FOR A SAD DAY,"( ) that's all Sigur Ros wanted to say, no credits, no song names, music is everything in this album...vocals...are just beautiful, this CD is ideal for a sad day, specially if it's raining, I loved the whole album, altough it isn't as good as Agaetis Byurn it is still something diferent from all the mainstream, if you don't like it I recommend you first hear Pink Floyd instrumental suites, Brian Eno ambiental songs, Verve's A storm in heaven album and some Radiohead stuff, they can be just the near refferences for Sigur Ros that is something very diferent to all the stuff you ever heard."
4,"Well, I am not really this sort of person.","Okay, I bought this almbum cause I liked the DVD I own called 'Vanilla Sky'. I bought the soundtrack as I was interested in getting the final song on the movie played by Sigur Ros. 'The Nothing Song'. It was not on the soundtrack of the movie as It was not officially released then. I had to wait about a year until this album came out. What bothered me is, most of the CD is way to depressing for me to listen to, I mean, track 7 is quite good for my personality, but you really have to listen to it as it is a bit different from the other albums these guys have out. I think it is fairly good if you like haunting sounds, but this just seems a bit gimmicky to me, like they are trying to package it as ""Beautiful and Haunting"" when I don not think the band put in as much of the good stuff as in their other work. But check this CD out, you may like it..."
4,"charming , pure , and finally back!!!","And finally They have returned...!! Sigur Ros is back with an astonishing cd from beginning to end, resuming their charming ways for everyone's delight! Definitely a masterpiece if you consider that the fouth track can be heard during Cruise's diving from the top of the building at the end of ""vanilla sky"" so now there you have it!! Also you' d be particularly touched by the sixth track which is simply one of the purest and most beautiful track I've ever heard! Nice continuity anyway from this particular (in every sense of the word) band!Get ready for an unforgettable trip to the boundaries of dream and delight!"
5,VERY HAPPY TO READ A GREAT BOOK ON CHRONIC FATIGUE!!!!!!!1,"ANY ONE WITH CFIDS NEEDS TO READ THIS BOOK.I WROTE ""BEYOND THE DARK CLOUD""REGARDING CFIDS,I LEARNED A GREAT DEAL FROM THIS FINE BOOK, AND WILL TELL OTHERS ABOUT IT.IM THE FOUNDER OF CHRONIC FATIGUE AND IMMUNE DYSFUNCTION MEDIA AWARENESS AND DEDICATED MY LIFE HELPING OTHERS. THANK YOU MR GOLDBERG TO KEEP US ALL INFORMED.THEA SCHLOSSER"
5,REALLY AWESOME!!,Teri Yamada does a great job of putting together really great short stories from Southeast Asia. She did an awesome job of gathering stories that are fun to read and make you really think about the situation of different places in Southeast Asia (LOTS of corruption). It also gives you a taste of the VERY talented authors in Southeast Asia. TERRIFIC ANTHOLOGY!!!
5,Great Information for Parents and Professionals,"I have recommended this video to parents to illustrate the similarities between ASD and SPD. It also shows that parents have options - choices for service delivery (DIR/Floortime, Sonrise, ABA) as well as preschool placements. A very powerful video!"
1,Misguided and outdated,"This book was written in the 1970's, which I wish I had paid attention to before ordering. Its very much an outdated book. I thought the diet he constructed to help hypoclycemia was all wrong. Its a high carb, low protein diet. He talks about the evils of protein which I don't agree with at all. I just did not like this book!"
2,dissapointing and expensive,"i really needed a scrapbook, and got this miniscule, more-photo-album than a scrapbook. maybe i don't know sizes but i didn't think 8 by 8 would be so small. it's the size of a normal sized plate. but in a square shape of course. and the paper is not some fantastic paper. its the ones you use when doing a presentation for a project. that hard paper. i don't know, i just suspected it would be high quality, glossy paper. this scrapbook with the paper made me think, ""looks like i could have put this together."" if i wanted/expected something as tiny as this then i would be giving it 5 stars and say it is cute. of course i'd be expecting it to cost much less too. but i have lots of normal sized pics/clippings (from mags e.t.c) and this is no use to me. there's no way my pics can fit in this. bottom line, for so much $ i expected more. i've learned my lesson to go in a shop to buy these kinds of stuff. b/c you can't tell what you're purchasing when it's on line."
5,Wisdom and Humor,Monte's book covers the basic essence of doing well in the academic environment. It is clear to me that he knows it well as both a student and a professor. He delivers his wisdom of years with some tongue-in-cheek humor. I recommend this book to any prospective college student. It will help you to not only survive but to excel.
4,"Awesome for scholars, needs Phoenician symbols","It's a book for people who know how to digest it for study. They should have, IMO, included the alphabet, and go from right to left for the translations and transliterations. But all in all, you won't learn Phoenician froma batter source."
5,A Exquisite Book,"This was a exquisitely written story. Interesting characterization, good plot and sensational love scenes. This book kept me reading every page. I give Jennifer Blake five star rating with this one. I will keep Southern Rapture on my shelve to read again and again."
2,Fire the editor,"I didn't know if it was Jennifer Blake's fault or the publisher's, but this story got very confusing until I realized it had to be an editing mistake. I don't know how to say it without giving away the ""plot twist"" so... Ransom, the naive young man, and the sexy rogue Thorn were often mentioned as the same person, when we weren't supposed to find out about that until the end, because that's when the female lead character Lettie figured it out. Confused? I am. I didn't even buy this, it was my mother's flea market copy. You start reading it, and think, "" wait a minute, I thought she was with Thorn, and she's calling him Ransom; instead of calling him Thorn or whatever."" I had to keep back-tracking because I got so confused as to who was in the scene. It has its moments, but pack a lunch; it's a long torturous read."
1,Co-Dependency Trap,I did not care for this book at all. It was not very informative. It did not provide any information that I did not already know
3,Convoluted,The information was good but convoluted and no longer fit my needs. It would probably interest someone in a tangled relationship. dj
1,Breaking Through Redundancy,"I found this book to be most annoying. The authors spend much too much time listing reasons why an M.D. would prescribe other treatment for the co-dependency condition. They seem to go over this chapter after chapter and one finds himself asking ""why are they saying this again?"" I don't want to read about how some doctors have been wrong in treating this condition - I want to learn practical ways to improve my personal relationships which are plagued by it. I was also offended by the ""anti-traditional religion"" remarks. These people may practice some kind of New Age, Secular Humanist ""faith"" and that's fine for them - but don't tell others that their traditional faith whether Christian, Jewish or Islam - is childish. These negative remarks do nothing but make one doubt the integrity and character of the authors."
3,Too much of the unknown songs,"If ""Essential"" means unreleased and rarities, then this is the collection for you. This artist had over 20 top forty songs (let alone country hits), but instead we get rare early songs and few hits."
5,Richie's Picks: ALL JOIN IN,"There as been a wealth of excellent children's poetry published over the fifteen years since ALL JOIN IN first appeared. And yet, such pieces here as ""Sorting out the kitchen pans"" remain totally unique, fresh, and hysterically funny. I read this aloud hundreds of times during circle time and still am not tired of it."
3,Okay Book,"I didn't really get into this book, I just thought it was Ok, course another Reader might feel different, I love reading Westerns, especially if it's a good book, but can't say that with this book."
1,Fell apart in light wind-serious design flaws,"I knew this item would be less than stellar because of the low price. The design, while easy to put together, is NOT a good one. Tubes slide into other tubes, but there is no locking mechanism to keep them from turning. This means that they are able to rotate at any moment, and dump the person in the hammock on the ground. Came out to the backyard yesterday to find the whole thing in a jumble on the ground after a light wind.ALSO-there are TWO hooks on either end to hang the hammock (did NOT notice this in the picture) this means that there is virtually no ""swing"" to the hammock, making it basically just a lounge.I am going now to see how much of a pain it is to ship it back, even tho it is obviously NOT the retailers fault it is such a poorly designed product. I would still recommend they NOT re order this."
3,It's ok but not very sturdy...,Hammock itself is sturdy but the stand is cheaply made. Works great unless you have to move it or you lay back on it too fast. You'll tip over. We have the head of it against a wall for sturdiness.
2,not worth the money,"The hammock is comfortable but frame falls completely apart, and hammock cannot swing. Wish I had saved my box to return it."
4,Relaxation,"Have not been really able to use this as to the weather being in the 90's - 100's, but looking forward to the fall so we can use it. Wish it came with a pillow."
2,NOT FOR ME,"TOO SOFT;FIRST YOGA BOLSTER WITH A FOAM FILLING.BEAUTIFUL WELL MADE COVER AND QUALITY,BUT IT DOESNT WORK FOR ME.IF YOURE LOOKING FOR THE REAL THICK AND HEAVY ONE ,TRY A DIFFERENT ONE.WILL RETURN.TOO BAD THE FILLING CONTENT LABEL IS NOT LISTED IN THE ITEM'S DESCRIPTION."
2,Bolsters need covers,"When I got this bolster a year ago, it adequately served its purpose, and I didn't think too much about it. I didn't use it all that often, but it was quite serviceable whenever I did. Then my massage therapist forgot her round bolster, and used mine, getting massage oil all over it. Since she is a kind thoughtful person, she offered to clean it for me. It totally and completely shrunk, nearly 30% shrinkage. Replacement bolster covers are not available from the Hugger Mugger website as of 5 minutes ago, so I now have either a completely useless bolster, or I have to go scouring the web to try to find a replacement cover from an outlet that I would trust. Bottom line: don't get your bolster dirty, or you will have completely wasted your money."
4,Bolsters a must for restorative practice,"I like the Hugger Mugger brand, as I'm familiar with it from my former yoga studio in Rapid City, SD. The bolsters are firm, just the right size, and the cover zips off for cleaning. The only reason I gave it four stars is because I'd like a handle on each end, not just one end! Highly recommended. (P.S. The plum color is beautiful--kind of a combo of navy and purple.)"
2,Not firm enough,"This product has a durable cover, but it's simply not firm enough. It's filled with a 2 inch thick foam core surrounded by a very light cotton filler (YES-I disassembled it). This bolster claims to be 6 inches thick. I'm 170 lbs and it flattens to about half that when I sit or lay on it. The bolsters I used in class are probably filled with all cotton rags -no foam and that's what I expected from Hugger Mugger. Next time, I'll go to a brick and mortar store to check out anything I'm not familiar with -and pay the premium to make sure I get what I want."
5,"It is discipline, stupid.",Discipline is as much critical for business success as profit.A great book for every businessman as well as retailers.
4,My Favorite Watch,"My review is very similar to the previous two. I have purchased this watch 2 or 3 times, and it is the only one that I've worn over the last 10-11 years. I wear it in the shower, doing the dishes, washing my hands--I basically don't take it off except for swimming. It takes abuse pretty well. The face does get scratched, and the water resistance is compromised when you change the battery. I still keep coming back to this watch because I love it. The style is feminine with out being fru-fru (I am not a fru-fru girl). Also, I love that it is two-tone because it goes with everything. I really wish that it was more water resistant/proof--then it would be perfect!"
4,Folio Two Tone Works,"Same as the above rater. When changing the battery, something happens to the seal. About two years is about right. For the price, it's not a bad deal. Next time, I think I will get a new seal or something."
5,From the Producer,"I produced this recording with Joseph Villa in one evening in 1984 after he had played ""Orage"" for me. Because of the great expense of making CDs in 1984, our budget was limited. None the less, Villa was the last pianist of his kind, a true Romantic. Only Pletnev today is as interesting, but not as passionate. While the sound is not what I wished, the playing is stupendous. Joseph died tragically at the age of 46, in 1995. This recording is a rare momento indeed of an artist who was below the radar, except for his peers. They all thought him a genius.His first recording, ""A Liszt Recital"", won the Liszt Prize in Budapest."
5,A good bit of Andy for a good price...,"Nice to see this out on video, I'd forgotten that he'd done this! Good quality, and a nice introduction for anyone curious about his work but sadly are too young to have been around to see the real Andy perform back in the day. It was also quite eerie as well, hearing him cough a number of times in the interview segment. Personally, I hope for a compilation of his Letterman appearances, but until then, this tape will make you smile, and maybe like me, remember just how much we lost when Andy left us."
5,The Best Kaufman DVD... So Far,"It's a shame that Andy left us so soon, yet one rarely falls into the category of ""legend"" with out succumbing to mortality. Anybody interested enough in Andy to be reading this review probably recognizes at least a hint of his comic genius, therefore I will not expound on this subject.This DVD is, beyond a doubt, the most comprehensive compendium of Andy Kaufman's acts yet availablke on this format, and it is all in one show. You get everything, as mentioned in the description up top and many other reviews. As a primer to Andy, this disc is well worth buying. As an adition to the collection of a long-time Kaufman plan, this DVD fits in perfectly with your collection."
5,Andy's finest performance,"This is definitely the most entertaining Andy Kaufman DVD available, it contains all of his best routines performed to perfection.The Midnight Special definitely captured Andy in his prime and it's amazing that he was able to cram so much into one show.Here's what you get:-Foreign Man-Elvis-Tony Clifton(His finest hour!)-Andy working at Jerry's Deli-Andy wrestling ""the ladies""-Weird gibberish puppet routine-Interviewing Slim Whitman and Freddy Cannon-Andy with his entourage (Bob Zmuda, Bob Shapiro, etc.)Basically, if you loved ""Man on the Moon"", you'll get to see some of the same material performed by Andy himself.Buy and enjoy!"
3,Just buy the Andy Kaufman Special,"For the fan of Andy Kaufman this, as with all his work is a must have. However, if you are just beginning to get into Andy, this performance is not his best. Granted his reaction to Slim Whitman and falsetto are priceless, but when compared to the magnificent 'Andy's Funhouse Special' (listed here as the Andy Kaufman Special) it pales in comparison. Save your cash unless you know what you're getting into."
4,A Real Familial Division Of Opinion,"My husband Jim and I watched this together and we had very different reactions. Jim thought that actor Jim Carrey did a better job of playing Andy Kaufmann in the ""Man In The Moon"" movie than the real Andy K did doing his act. While Jim's busy rejecting the real thing, I am convulsed with laughter watching the tape, holding my sides! Perhaps one clip shows our division better than any other. There's Jim seriously watching Andy K talking to the interviewer about keeping his humility by working as a busboy, while being a big tv star, and there's me, absolutely incredulous that Jim can't see that Andy K is putting him/us on! Andy never breaks character and always comes across as wholly sincere and white, middle class while making the most outrageous claims. I'd give it a 5. I think Jim would give it a 2 but, since I'm filling this out, it gets a 4! Ok, maybe you do need an odd sense of humor to enjoy him but he was a hit in his day, wasn't he?"
3,The One and Only Andy Kaufman,"I first saw Andy in reruns of Taxi. I, and most people my age (17) had no idea who he was. I learned more about him after seeing some television specials and through my own research. He soon became who I thought was the funniest man ever to hit T.V. I always wanted to learn more about him. His act and mentality drew me closer to wanting to discover who Andy was inside, which I don't think anyone will ever know."
1,Pure Horsepuckey,"This work is very short on fairness and long on sensationalism. Few historians doubt that Reno was inebriated (as the previous reviewer accruately states, is never mentioned in the film), and he lost his confidence when splattered with the brains of Bloody Knife. But Reno was not alone - Benteen (while not a friend of Custer's) had a long and honorable record of bravery. He would not have left Custer and his men to die if he could help. This film tries (unsuccessfully) to hide the poor tactical decisions of Custer. The most obvious being spliting his command in three before knowing the strength of the enemy. By the time he does know, it's too late. I'm surprised that such a dubious theory was put forth by the National Geographic Society."
4,Interesting perspectives?,"As an educator, I found this video to be informational enough for use in middle or high school classroom. It does not contain any inappropriate scenes. Its interjection of several perspectives allows for some interesting classroom discussion after the video. I think that the other two reviewers' comments on Amazon would be fun to throw into the mix after you have started the class discussion. =)I have posted a viewing guide for this video on teacherspayteachers website if you are interested in using it as well."
4,Jihn Denver- Greatest Hits-3 CD set,"Very good, I like it very much. It is a good buy and makes an excellent Christmas gift for a friend or family."
4,great looking women,"great exposure of georgia emerald, bought this dvd to see as much of her exposed as possible. great shots of her body, rest of movie is pretty weak. her T&A was the best."
3,Entertaining,"I found the book to be entertaining and I liked the way the first half of the book dealt with their lives in one incarnation and the second half the book dealt with another incarnation. The dog, Sam, seemed to be a cute character and very likeable. However, I didn't think the heroine and hero were developed as well as Victoria Alexander has done in her other works. My rating is based on reading most of her other books and comparing it with them. This one had some light humor, but not nearly as witty as the others."
4,It's newsprint,"Basic newsprint paper. It's glued into the binding very well and the edges are all very neatly cut. Erasing picks up what seems an excessive amount of paper fiber, but it's newsprint so that's hard to avoid."
3,ok i guess,"i got what I bought, but it took a while to ship, so don't try to buy this too close to your wedding day. Also I am missing a piece of beading on the front of mine."
3,"small size for my wife and ask extra link extantion, not available",It was good putchase and great value. Great customer service. Still Iam waiting if grandee version available smillar watches.
3,Wow!,"For starts, standard shipping was fast(Four days, east coast to west). It's not tightly knitted, so you'll find black fibers in your hair after wearing it. Because it's wool, it's itchy, but overall, I like it as my first beret. It goes great with my BDUs. I'm wearing it for airsoft."
3,"Great value, but not a great beret.","This is an okay beret, but it's not great quality. The wool is considerably thinner than you find in a top quality beret, but then the price is about one sixth what a great one costs. I use this beret when I'm working in the garden or on my car. If something happens to this beret I can replace it very cheaply. So I can wear a cap I enjoy without worry. When I go to town I wear my top quality beret. One other thing you should know is that this is a very wide floppy beret. I didn't think I'd like that when I first got it, but now I really like this feature. When you need to pull it down to shade your eyes it makes a much better shade than my top quality beret. The short story is: great for the money, but you get what you pay for."
4,Practical and theoretical,This book is everything a teacher would want from a resource book. It starts with articles by various multicultural theorists and moves on to how-to guides on how to engage parents and the community. The ending section includes usable lessons for your students.
4,Bad Picture,"Product is fine, and as usual with Amazon shipping was very fast. Product picture shows with the carry bag. Carry bag for this item is optional. Overall, a handy product for outdoor cooking with your Lodge dutch oven. They should show picture of product set up though!FOLLOW UPSee they fixed picture...great. Only reason I didn't give it a higher rating at the time was that I felt that the product was misrepresented in that the visual appeared to suggest the carry bag was included."
3,A disappointment,"The reason that I'm not pleased with this item is that they are not fully pink; there is random, brown blotching throughout the trivet that is decidedly strange and unappealing. I washed them in the dishwasher in hopes that this was dirt, but the brown discoloring remains. It makes me think that these are seconds. I'm not going to return them because they were a total of $6.17 for two of them, including free shipping (if your order is over $25 in qualifying products), and I'm trusting that they will live up to the other specifications, notwithstanding their appearance. From the tag, these trivets are supposed to withstand 572 degrees F, and open jars. I'm going to use them on glass refrigerator shelves under hot containers of food just cooked. Just know if you were planning to leave them out, they are not counter attractive."
4,Been there - Done that,"As a former Legislator, I can state with authority that these allegedly fictional characters ring true. Every bit of action in this swift murder mystery either has happened, or certainly could. It's a fast-paced, fun read, and I recommend it to anyone with a fascination for power, sex, intrigue, or the intoxicating combination of same."
4,A feel-good zombie movie,"I loved this movie. It's very funny and touching and thought-provoking and beautifully cinematographed in idealized 50's.It is not jumping-out-at-you scary, as one might expect of a zombie movie; it's about living, and who your family is, and where your loyalties lie. It is not especially kind to the rock-hard well-intentioned fathers of the families. Nor is it so profound as to keep one awake, but it makes a good presentation of its thesis and it is, as I said, both visually lovely and very funny."
3,"Supremely weird and unique, however it just didn't click with me.","This isn't a bad movie, it just isn't fast paced enough for me. It has some parts that are funny, and some parts with quick scares. I suppose if I was to summarize this movie I'd call it a fantasy-comedy. Everything serves to show you an alternative reality or to make you laugh. The alternative-fantasy-reality is kind of neat, but I'm not sure it warranted a movie."
5,Funnier than it deserves to be!,"This film should not have been this funny. The concept, while interesting, really doesn't have the legs to carry a whole film. Yet it does! This is because the direction, the writing, and the performances are all top notch! It is nice to see a zombie comedy made with a fair amount of talent and intelligence, and with an eye on style and story. If you haven't seen this, rent it now!"
4,worth a watch for sure,definitely a fun movie. great twist on the 50s propaganda films. If you like movies like Sawn of the Dead this is for you
3,"Please, make it stop.","I love zombie movies and really loved Shaun of the Dead and the Evil Dead series, but this one.... You had really like ""corny"" movies to appreciate this humor. Maybe if I will watch it a few more times it will change my mind."
4,Quite funny,"Was the right mixture of comedy to horror to social comment. Highly reccommended to anyone who generally likes ""zombie"" flicks."
5,Fido,"What a great and fun movie! Like Shawn of the Dead meets Leave it to Beaver. 5 stars for a great idea. If you liked Mystery Science 3000, you'll like this too."
3,Shawn of the dead 2,"Here's what happened after Z day. Kinda sorta, its a good movie, kinda funny, but no where near as fun and funny as shawn of the dead. This movie could of used a better story. Maybe better zombie action with gore.Overall not as bad as i originally thought."
4,Keeping Up Appearances in the Zombie Apocalypse,"This movie was brilliant! It's more of a very dark comedy than straight-up horror. The setting is a 1950s era neighborhood. Everything is bright, cheery, and pleasant, except for the rampaging zombies, of course. Carrie-Anne Moss is excellent as the Stepford wife obsessed with keeping up appearances, but just beginning to show some cracks. If you liked ""Cemetery Man"" or ""Black Sheep"" you'll like this one, and vice versa."
2,"Boring,unoriginal, culturally biased","I had high hopes for this quirky movie, but found it to be yet another one of the endless ""Pleasantville"" style hatchet jobs against white America. It wasn't funny. It wasn't scary. It was your typical brain-dead leukophobic attack on the liberal same straw man that Hollywood has been beating up for forty years. No artistic merit, no replay value, and it's racist to boot.Fail."
5,Genius,"I'm not a fan of the ""Zombie Genre"" but this quirky indie sells it. Funny, well acted, clever script and concept with low gore factor and high wit (even for zombies :-P) Fun for Zombie fans and Indi fans a like. Smart little film."
4,Better then worse.,"Fido is a good movie. It is quick, easy to follow and well, when all heck breaks loose you get into the action. There is gore, there are shootings and there is a pretty cool ending.The zombies are domesticated somewhat but there are rogue zombies as well. The end of the movie is pretty depressing when you see just how crappy the humans have it.All in all it is a worth zombie movie. Not as good as shaun of the dead but worthy never the less."
5,Best movie I've seen all year!,"If you are a fan of zombie flicks, especially if you enjoyed Shaun of the Dead or the Return of the Living Dead series, stop reading and get this now! Even my wife, who doesn't do horror movies much less zombie movies, thought that Fido was absolutely hilarious."
4,Pretty decent,"I fear the man who gave this item a 1 star probably is pretty grumpy.I liked this film. It seems to ask some certain questions (are zombies really dead?), and offers a possible insight impact on people who don't want to be undead--by being buried with your head removed.I found the film perpetually strange. I grew up in the 50's and watched the shows of the times, and the goofy allusions to this time frame are used very well. All the cliche's from the fifties television shows (and ""Lassie"") are highlighted and given a run through.Odd to think that the ""vast wasteland"" once spoken of, is now considered the role model the Right Wing holds so dear.One real annoyance: how come Billy Connolly didn't make any commentary? And why would a master verbal comic decide to do a role where he has no speaking parts (growling doesn't count as dialog)? He does use his face to an amazing degree, and makes you realize what an actor he could be if only given that one good role."
4,good addition to your zombie collection,"Its kind of like pleasantville meets dawn of the dead. funny movie but kind of slow in spots. its pretty original I'll give it that. I would recommend it to any ""dead"" fan."
5,Alot like Lassie....,"What a clever, funny movie! It reminds me of the old ""Lassie"" TV shows, except this time ""Lassie"" is a zombie, instead of a collie dog. I was suprised at how much I enjoy this movie. It's like watching a real movie, but it has such an off-the-wall storyline. I think that is one of the things that makes it so funny. Carrie Ann Moss is perfect as the mother in this. I have already recommended this to my friends as a ""must-see""."
1,THIS MOVIE BORED ME TO SLEEP.....,"Read all the ""one star"" reviews on this movie....they pretty much sum up all I could say about this film.I should have just rented it. I didn't even finish watching it; I fell asleep half way thru it.Don't EVEN waste your time."
1,Are You Kidding Me?,"I made it a half hour into this POS before I turned it off. You people giving this a good review must also find Seinfeld funny. Pure garbage.And for your people ranking this up there with ""Shaun Of The Dead"", hang your heads in shame. Not even close, bud!"
4,A Boy and His Brain Eater,"I can only describe this lovely little movie as Leave It to Beaver meets Night of the Living Dead. You will find much more campy humor than blood and guts in this one, and for the intention of this film, I think that's okay. You will never find a more touching story about a boy making friends with his undead butler. This is definitely a zombie movie that's out for the heart, instead of the brain."
4,3 years & going strong!,"My oldest daughter got the older version of this product for her 5th birthday. She could only play a couple of the games at the time, but she loved it. For three years now it has been her all-time favorite car toy. It has been dropped, banged, kicked, stepped on, fought over, and everything else two kids could do to it in 3 years, and still works great! Drawbacks: Pixter & Leapster caught on that kids might actually want to play their toys past 5pm in the car & put LCD lighting in, but this company hasn't caught on yet. Also, no headphones jack--some of the games make incredibly annoying noises! One more thing--the ages are not appropriately labeled. Closer to first grade and up."
2,A recipe for frustration,"My daughter has an earlier version that the one shown so it is possible they have addressed some of these issues:1) most games have a 1 minute time out which is really frustrating for my kids2) ""Oh that's not so good"" - If I hear Barbie say that one more time I may just throw this thing out the nearest window. My daughter will get a score in a game she feels really good about and barbie says, ""Oh that's not so good, but you'll be better with a bit more practice"" This has broken my daughter down into tears more than once.3) There are no parental controls. I wanted to turn off or lengthen the timer. I expected those sorts of features from Oregon Scientific.Right now the most fun thing my kids do with it is play the Flower Fun game (like hangman) and type in ""ICUP""If you are looking at a newer version of this I would strongly recommend playing with a demo for a few minutes to check it out."
2,Not what it looks like,"This belly ring is MUCH LARGER than I had expected, is crooked, and just not what I thought it was... It sticks out kinda far and is sort of gaudy,... Hope this helps..."
1,Nauseating,"This book is not about femdom but a detailed and boring description of horrible tortures, chemotherapy, childbirth, etc. I suggest that the author should read Titian Beresford's books and learn something about female domination before he writes yet another book about it."
3,gem polishing,this book is ok gives the basics. but if you want more advanced this is not the book to get
3,Some good stuff,"There was a good amount of footage of her, but not nearly enough and I didn't get to see her perform some of my favorites, but still worth owning."
1,Billie Hoiladay Ulitmate Collection,"This was a vidio, I wanted a cd. this was a gift. so now I will have to sell it to get my money back"
4,very revealing of the man behind the masterpieces,I've loved Kafka's work forever so reading the diaries was interesting. Intense stuff to be taken in smallish doses. Recommended.
2,IT'S VERY LOUD,Whatever product engineers built this lovely toy withOUT a volume control should be fired! This laptop was bought for my 8 year old daughter. It's so easy. She mastered it in one night. I can't believe the manufacturer recommends this for ages 3-12. ??
3,WHAT? Can't hear you...volume's too loud,"This is a great learning tool for my 4yr old daughter. She loves it and has learned plenty, however, you cannot look past the fact that it ear piercingly loud. I find it hard to believe they overlooked this huge factor in the design process. We taped a piece of plastic over the speaker (which is on the screen facing you) to muffle the sound. I'd wait till the next version is released...HOPEFULLY....with volume control."
1,PIECE OF JUNK!!!!,"Cheaply made, no volume control, LCD screen is the worst resolution I've ever seen - alst unreadable and images totally unrecognizable!!"
2,Too much noise,My child got this for Christmas last year. She is now 4. It hasn't even been a year and it doesn't work already. I've reset it a million times and have changed the batteries but it keeps repeating the into music. It's not like my child was rough with it and threw it around. She's actually very good with her things. The worst part of all is that it was way too loud. She loved it while it worked but it's not worth the money if it's going to break down in less than a year.
1,Lasted one day,"At first we couldn't turn this machine off. The on/off button had no effect, and the reset button just stopped the irritatingly loud jingle while pressed. After removing the batteries and re-installing after 5 minutes, it restarted properly and my daughter played with it for 5-10 minutes. The next day we could not get it to come back on. We have tried new batteries and since we had discarded the packaging are now stuck with a piece of plastic junk."
4,First Gift my toddler asked for!,"Well I have to say after reading the reviews, I was not sure if this was the toy for us, but after my 2 1/2 year old asked many times for her own ""puter"" like mommy and daddy, I thought we would give a try. I am THRILLED with this product. There is soo much for them to do. By just sliding the slide you can choose between numbers, letters, music and much more. Even an I Spy. I agree the volume is a bit on the high side, even for a childs toy. I was also surprised that there was no volume control, but an easy thing to fix with tape. MANY MANY toys have been kept under control that way. She has not put it down very much since we purchased it. Its still ""new"", but I believe this toy will be well worth the money. Kudos Barbie on the educational toy!"
1,PLEASE get me some earplugs!,"First of all, this item is very loud and has no volume control and no headphone jack, so you have no choice but to listen to it at a ridiculous volume.Secondly, the recommendation or 3-9 years is absurd. My daughter is 5 and has mastered most of the tasks on this ""computer"" in no time at all. For the price, I would expect a toy to keep a child's attention for longer than a few days!In short, don't waste your money!"
1,too simple,"I ordered this product for my 5 year old daughter for Christmas, considering the recommended age group of 3-9 years (by toys r us) (it's 3-12 years by the manufacturer) This product is way too simple for a 5 year old, probably more suitable for a 3 year old. It focuses on teaching letters and numbers, something most 4-5 year olds already know, and certainly most 9-12 year olds. Get it for your 3 year old, but expect them to master it quickly."
1,HELLOOOO.....I CAN'T HEAR YOU!!!!!!,"GOOD LORD, WHERE'S THE VOLUME CONTROL ON THIS?????? WAIT, THERE IS NONE. It's sorta fun for my three year old, she gets pretty bored with it easily. I think I'm going to duck tape the speaker right now, maybe that will help."
3,TOO LOUD!!!!!!!,"My daughter just received this laptop for her 4th birthday. I would love to give it 5 stars, but it is entirely TOO LOUD. It is hard to imagine that a product that can do so many things does not have volume control. In order for her to use it, I am going to have to figure out how to tape something over the speaker to reduce the volume. I'd be interested to know what decibal this product is tested at. It can NOT be healthy for anyone's hearing. Very disappointed."
4,Great product...my 5 year old loves it.,I bought this for my 5 year old daughter for Christmas. She loves it!! It is something that she can play on her own and we can play together. It has a lot of phonics games and other word and letter games... and best of all it keeps her occupied in the car!!!
2,Meh,"Vapid teenagers who achieve neither redemption or tragedy by the end of an overwrought tour through their shallow existences. Excellent artwork of very plausible characters, but little pleasure gained from knowing them."
3,Not my cup of tea,"I just didn't find this book to very engaging. I didn't like the characters and just couldn't relate to the story. Apparently I'm in the minority. It wasn't horrible, but it just kind of meandered. The art was good, but the rest was too off putting."
1,Two bimbos,"Two inspid American imbeciles discuss other people's looks, what does and doesn't suck, and deliberate for whom they should spread their legs. No plot, no payoff, no point. Pretentious claptrap for self-enlightened indie clowns."
3,Teen Angst Tidily Summed Up,"In some edge city anywhere in the United States, our protagonists try to understand who they are whilst wreaking havoc on the lives of those around them.Quite frankly, it bored me. I loved the movie, however, which is what drove me to get the book. Now, if only Steve Buscemi and Terry Zwigoff had worked on the book..."
4,Didn't like the movie...,"I didn't like the Ghost world movie, but the graphic novel was a lot better. There were a couple of times I got confused with people (heh, maybe it's just me) but it was funny and there were moments when I could relate to the characters and the artwork was cool what with the blue and all and so overall I would recommend it to anyone who is as addicted to graphic novels as I am."
3,"Good, but Not Great",I liked this but I still enjoyed the movie even better. It's nice to read a comic book that is deceptive in the way it seems like it's about nothing but it actually has a whole lot to say about growing up.
4,Now I'll have to see the movie . . .,"This slice of late teenagehood is not your typical graphic novel. Enid is a profane and not terribly attractive girl filled with self-loathing, subject to mood swings, fits of punk-ism, and a two-minute attention span, who is obsessed with her non-boyfriend, Joshua, and her own unappeased sexuality. Rebecca, her lifelong best friend, is much prettier, less volatile, and pretty much lets Enid run her life. They observe and discuss the people they know, reflect on their childhood memories, and avoid discussing what their lives might be like without each other. It's almost like a reality show -- but much better."
4,as good as comics get,"I'll admit the only reason I wanted to read this was because I had already seen the movie, which was excellent. I have to say that this probably the best comic I have ever read. Of course, my comic reading days were limited to Archie comics, and it's been a long time since I read those. The characters were all so funny and realistic. I can't help but relate to Enid as I felt alienated and alone also at that age.This is worth a look at if you like comics of all kinds. Thumbs way up!"
5,"funny, sad, insightful","Read this now before the film comes out, so you're able to have the original feel for what this story is about. Daniel Clowes is fantastic at capturing the subtle and not so subtle aspects of girls and friendship. The comic is spooky, hilarious, dry and just right-on in so many ways. Buy it! You won't be sorry."
4,This is really cool!,"This movie blew my mind! The camerawork and editing are just amazing, better than in some biger busget films! The references are all there, from Tarantino to Woo to Cassavetes. Anyone interested at all in independent film should see this. There were some bits that I didn't like, for example dialogue that over runs. Otherwise worth watching"
5,I agree (buy this album),"I don't usually review items but had to stop when I saw this CD had only one review. Paul Durham's voice was made for rock, and the sort of beats/instrumentals that accompany his lyrics are amazing.This is what rock should be."
5,great musical artist,"wonderful music choiceinteresting new artist and new music. very relaxing. well done. music to relax by, and unique. new musical artist to follow in the future"
1,Black Lab,"I don't see what all the fuss is about. I thought the music on this album was, for lack of a better word, boring. Nothing special or unique here. I'd also like to add that the cover art is distasteful. Putting pornography on your album cover to try and sell a few more records is pretty sleazy. I realize a lot of people may disagree and probably like it, but I find it highly offensive."
5,tenor sax ecstasy!,"mr. winter has quite an album for us. The final cut, Jimmy's Gospel is superbly enjoyable. I am reading thru the negative reviews and can only think these reviewers just don't like tenor sax."
1,Terrible...,"I can't believe all these positive reviews! Blah...This turkey is pretty awful with Edgar doing his best to sound like a cross between a Las Vegas lounge singer and Stevie Wonder. He sings normally one minute, wails hysterically the next. Gawd...It's not even good lounge singing or Vegas music let alone, rock. One of the most inauspicious debuts of all time.Deserves a minus 5 if I could give one..."
1,I also received the wrong bags,Another reviewer mentioned that they received the baking soda bags - so did I. Very frustrating. I haven't contacted customer service yet - we'll see what happens. Buyer beware!!
4,pretty nice,a television series that I watched back in the 70's but have much more appreciation watching it now. I received the product pretty quickly without waiting for long. Great job Amazon.com
4,were is the 2 hr pilot,"All episodes are great quality ,but where is the 2 hour pilot? And do we have to wait another 3 years for season 2 (t j hooker , charlies angels,family, s.w.a.t)? why would they leave it out . highly priced set with no interviews and no pilot . oh well ,, people if we dont speek up expect sony to not improve their season sets."
4,excellent,"i took one star away because its not worth 8 dollars. this is packed with wonderful stories,lore,and i enjoyed the weather predictions and the article on finding a place to sit.the calendar is wonderful too. like both the witches almanac and magical almanac equally"
4,Witches' Almanac 2000-2001,"As a new witch, I have found the Witches'Almanac a helpful tool. It has helped me learn The way of the Moon, the Astrological Keys, eclipses, and houses or twelve areas of life. As well as introduce my friends to my interests, even the most stubborn friends find your horoscopes precise. I have to keep one copy in view for everyone to read. The moon calander is a great guideline to me. It would be helpful to include an explanation of some of the daily proverbs. ""Whistle up the green wind""; March 12, 2000, or today January 31, ""celebrate Brigit's promise"". It would be helpful to include some corresponding story on the opposite page to some that are less self-explanatory. Thank you for helping me in my quest for Complete Lunar Harmony. over the years. Blessed Be"
5,The most reliable almanac; much better than Lewellyns'...,"For about four years i've been reading this book, and it has never made me regret buying it. This is one of the best books published on this subject nowadays, and its wonderful that it comes out every year. I look forward to each new copy.It has gained a notoriety among the community, and has even been used in movies like ""The Craft."" It's a shame this book is not more popular; its really a treasure, and should be known by everyone."
4,"Delightful, and interesting","The Witches' Almanac is a great resource from year to year. The layout and illustrations are wonderful, and the calendar is useful. The articles range from current events, to mythology, to practical techniques. I highly recommend this almanac."
2,excuse me 7.95 for a book with a papercover,"don't get me wrong this book has alot of useful facts in it, buts not worth 7.95, and whats with the picture of the elder women, throw live birds in a cauldron, with stuff like that no wonder the christians think we sacrifice."
4,The Witche's Almanac,"I really found this book helpful as a fairly new Witch. I find that you still have to do more research to find out what the moon phases mean and but the basic helpful information is clearly laid out for you. You can use the information how you want to. There is alot of other information in the book including horoscope, recipies, folklore and AMERICAN (not Canadian) weather predictions. - I found it well worth the price. I have not read ""Llewellyn's Magical Almanac"" but plan to compare the 2 books."
4,Not going to win any awards but what the hey!,"Each year I find myself purchasing the Witches' Almanac. I am not wiccan and have no intentions of being so, but I am drawn to it like a moth to the flame. Maybe it's just my Uranus wanting to shock the hell out of people who see me reading it on my lunch break!I always find the most interesting news articles and briefs in these publications that you never see on the local news. The poetry is always well worth the read and the calendar isn't half bad.Over all, don't expect any depth or real educational, but a nice little splurge and certainly not overpriced."
2,Not a very accessible text,"This book was required for a class I took on Electrical Engineering. I wish I had never bought it.Overall the text seems very complete, but difficult to get into, and relatively useless as a study aid. Normally I prefer my course texts on introductory material to be very explanatory, and hopefully clear. This book is neither. Rather than spell things out in simple terms, the author makes it quite a chore to follow through on both his logic and equation progressions.I imagine that if you already knew everything, and just needed a nice fat book on Electrical Engineering for reference, this one would do nicely. It however makes for a very frustrating intro."
4,"Better than average, but not the only book for the EE.","Decent introduction for anyone with a basic understanding of electronics. The text starts off with fundamental rules, ohm's law, kcl, kvl, etc. There is a really nice explanation of how diodes and transistors work on the electron level. Some very good information is here for anyone who would like to know HOW something actually works.This book, however, falters when applying techniques to real world situations. But this is a book of the fundamentals of EE. It won't be the only EE book on my shelf, but it has it's place."
5,Really love it,I purchased it after reading some of the reviews and very happy. It is definitely quality parfum. I put on a little and it stays on all day. I get a lot of compliments.
2,A fake?,I have used Miss Dior Cherie for a long time now and decided to purchase a new bottle via Amazon this time instead of from a trusted source. I think this was a mistake because both myself and my fiance feel that my new bottle does not smell like it should. It is slightly too sweet. Next time I will pay full price and get what I was expecting.
1,Terrible,I have been wearing Miss Dior Cherie for 3 years. I used to work for Dior and it was my signature sent. Everyone always complimented me. This has been tampered with 100percent. You know how your senses always remember certain sents. Like how your dad smelled when you were little and stuff? Well i opened this Miss Dior Cherie and it absolutly stinks. And i smelled the inside of the wrapper that wraps around the outside of the box and it smells like baby powder. I never ever smell like baby powder. I am so angry. This was a 92 dollar bottle of purfume. Thats so uncalled for. I would never do this to someone.100 percent horrible.
1,Not real!!!,"I love this perfume and have worn it for a long time. However, fragrance.net sent me counterfeit perfume that smelled NOTHING like the actual one! Very disappointing!"
3,Miss Cherie Dior,"Very quick delivery. Nice taste, a bit strong but in the mean time really ""delicate"" too."
2,Pretty bottle,Definately smells like cheap perfume to me. Don't be fooled by the pretty bottle. Lomani makes a perfume called Si Fleuri Passion which is much cheaper and smells exactly the same. If you happen to like this smell save your money and buy the cheaper version.
1,upset,Its been over a month since I've ordered the product and I still haven't received it but the money got debited right away =(
1,not what I sent for,did not receive what was listed on the page..will not be purchasing this any time soon so much for product description
2,If you like it flat and one dimensional...,"This one is a safe choice for those who like to spray themselves once and experience the safety of a one dimensional perfume that stays exactly the way you sprayed it on. Very unimaginative. Kinda like mom who plays it safe. For something that carries the name 'Dior' on the packaging I honestly expected something far more complex. It's not horrible-horrible, just plain flat."
5,Beautiful scent,"The other customer reviewing this product obviously likes simple scents. Nothing wrong with that, but that does NOT mean this is a bad scent. It is fabulous. Feminine, complex, floral but not flowery, and just a very elegant and unique vibe to it. I've gotten lots of compliments asking what I am wearing with this scent, other women have asked me to write down the name for them... and not many perfumes get even a second sniff."
4,good choice!,"I got this for my daughter for Christmas, and she loves it. She's in high school and loves to wear this fragrance!"
1,I would not recommend this,"This is the worst scent I have ever tried from Dior. I would not recommend it at all. It smells like cheap perfume, almost like pine or evergreen(which is fine for air freshener), but I definitely would not recommend this for the sophisticated user. I will say one thing positive about it though, it is strong and lasts and lasts forever. I couldn't get rid of the scent quick enough! If you like it, please use it sparingly, so people like me won't have to smell it long after you walk away."
5,Does the job,"What to review? It's a rubber hanger for the exhaust. It worked, it was cheaper on Amazon that the parts stores or other online stores. I'm satisfied."
2,Did not fit '95 Avalon,This did not fit my '95 Toyota Avalon XLS as the part finder said it would. The one that was installed is much flatter with an elongated hole instead of round... Hope to return this item.
2,New kid's head on the block,"Precious, vapid and unmemorable, bar two *knockout* poems, the poignant A Return and the even more perfect School Street; it helps that the latter is funny, always a good sign. So, what's going on, Matt? (The dazzling reviews here are for the most part suspicious, odd or cringeworthy.) Less is more. Don't blow it."
5,Better then this is simply not possible!,"When I bought this book, I fell in love with almost every jewellery design. The book is divided in various parts, first the text with how Mr. Winston got started. The well-known story of Mr. Winston's first purchase of a green stone for USD 25 which he eventually sold for many hundreds of dollars more when it turned out to be an emerald. He was truly a genius, in recognizing the finest gems but also with the help of his designer (Mr. Shinde) to put them in a way that the stones looked like they were floating on ice. It really is a wonderful book, the second part is with wonderful photos;(many screenstars, socialites, members of the nobility and the other lucky few etc wear those magnificent pieces) one more beautiful then the other. If you cannot afford - like myself - the real Harry Winston Jewellery, this book comes pretty close."
5,easy way to review casually,I like using these books when I don't feel like devoting the time to sit down and really study. I just use it as a fun way to review like playing a trivia game (albeit one I usually can't convince non-vet students to play with me) :)I have heard the questions are harder than the ones on the real test
3,Glassine envelopes,"I read in a magazine that a pastel artist wrapped her picture in glassine before sending it to protect it. I wasn't sure what glassine was but on arrival, it looked a lot like wax paper. Could this be?"
5,Informative book,"Within, are many informative issues relating to writing and each is backed up with the correct sentence."
1,More Proof That The Stones Are Thieves,"Greedy thieves.Ridiculous Ticket PricesRidiculous Number of Greatest Hits and Live albumsNow this insulting ""bait and switch""No conscience...shameful, absolutely shameful"
3,"A Trying, but Rewarding, Read","There is no doubt that this is the definitive biography of the renowned Captain Cook. For no other reason, persons with an interest in the greatest navigator of all time should read this work. While few details of his life outside of his three major expeditions have been retained, this book brings to life the Captain that sailed the world on his three voyages, including his personality, his foibles, his leadership, and his intellect. He was indeed a man with many admirable qualities.So why only three stars? While the book is well researched and well organized, it is not well written. Far too often, a jumble of words is presented as a substitute for a sentence. If Beaglehole could write clearly, this would certainly be a 5 star work. On the other hand, sadly enough, a clear writing style has not always been the hallmark of a professional historian."
5,Better than expected....,"I bought this because it was on sale, and figured ""Eh, what the heck, I'll give it a try. Worst thing that happens is I'll be out a few bucks."" I'm struggling with a 25lb weight gain due to prednisone, a steroid that is used for a bunch of medical conditions, which makes you gain weight and be wolf-hungry most of the time. It's helping control the feeling of starvation, and I'm using gum to combat the desire to have something chewy in my mouth."
3,wow,"so far i haven't lost any weight, but it has given me the raunchiest, smelliest farts in my life.."
3,The Youngsters - Lemonorange,"Great solid French electronic music. (I hesitate to say 'techno,' because several genres are represented here.) Suffice it to say, when everyone else was all about the filtered disco, the Youngsters never let their eyes off the techno ball. ""Illogique,"" for instance, has an undeniable drive, while ""Flightcase Pour Criquets"" approaches things from a more mellow stance. ""Lost In Palavas"" brings in some jazz breaks, but it's ""Choose"" that brings in the Detroit melody and solid beats. ""Doutes et Certitudes"" starts with a spacious feel, letting the breaks and alarm clock fall in as a wake-up mechanism, and despite the promises of ""Abusive Melody,"" it's not quite as pummeling as you'd expect. The cut-up of ""Dub Cham Me"" has a sparse jazzed-up charm, and the final track, ""Smile"" delves into shiny tech-house. A genre-straddling work, with a few genres turning out better than others."
3,it's decent,"not much to say; it works, the elastic can be replaced and adjusted...this price is decent because most other places charge upwards of 13 dollars. trust me, it's not worth more than $9..."
5,Great song and lyrics!,"If you are a fan of German hiphop, this is a group to check out. Mellowbag does everything in ENglish and the music and the lyrics are great. It's a mellow CD single that is a keeper!"
5,love Jan Brett,"I love Jan Brett, so I love this collection. My only complaint has nothing to do with the collection...but, I would have liked to have known what books were included in the collection before I bought it. I already have two of the books that are included, so that was a little disappointing. Otherwise, what's not to love about the wonderful border designs which are a story all by themselves?"
4,Beautiful Christmas but without Christ,great illustrations. But the content has very little with Christmas as christians understand it. It is just a usual secular staff about Santa and joys of winter.
5,Jan Brett's Christmas Treasury,"Wonderful detailed illustrations that children as well as adults love. We already were familiar with some of the stories by her that appear in the Treasury, are thrilled that she compiled them all into one book!"
2,"""Sunrise"" remix- NOT worth it!","I LOVE Duran Duran, but I wish I had my money back for this import single. ""What Happens Tomorrow"" is an incredible song, but I bought this for the Eric Prydz Mix of ""Sunrise,"" hoping to finally hear a club mix that actually included the vocals. (The first batch of remixes found on the ""Sunrise"" single all neglected to include Simon's full vocals.) Disappointed again! The beat to this version is great, but it is only 3 & a half minutes long & features only a few background vocals at the beginning. I guess there will never be a full-out vocal club mix available on CD. The closest thing I know of is the Jason Nevins Mix on the ""Queer Eye"" soundtrack.Bottom line: Someone needs to take lessons from bands like Erasure, who still put out singles with multiple remixes & non-album songs that are well worth the money. 13 bucks is just too much for an album version that I already have & a short, vocal-less club mix. Shame on Epic records & Duran Duran!"
4,Really cool and cute!,"I ordered this book and when I got it I couldn't wait to start filling it out!! It's a book for us people who need direction in filling out a journal. And this isn't an ordinary journal but a light-hearted therapist who listens to your life's hardships and lets you laugh about them. I would recommend this book for the 17 and older crowd because younger people couldn't fill as much out (because it has questions about all sorts of things, ranging from your first boyfriend, first hang-over, ugliest outfit, most demeaning job and...etc)Anyways, if this sounds appealing...at least check it out!"
4,Look Out Bridget Jones!,"Bridget Jones and her diary will have nothing on you once you sit down with this delightfully decadent do-it-yourself journal! This book not only brought smiles to my face, but it gave me an opportunity to face some of those pesty demons from the past in a humorous, yet healing way. This is a MUST-HAVE for anyone who has ever wanted to try keeping a journal...and it's much more affordable than a trip to an analyst!"
1,How stereotypical.,"I don't understand how anybody could find this ""good for them"" or feeling like they are ""self-discovering themselves"".It's horrible how the writers of this, think there are only 4 kinds of people in the world. This is destructive to individualism and finding who you really are. What if there really ONLY was 4 kinds of people in this world? How terrible would that be?! The world would stop turning.So kids, don't buy this mind-numbing, spirit-crushing thing. Get a blank piece of paper instead, and write there how YOU feel."
5,A Latin legend @}->---,"I cannot begin to tell you how much I love Jon Secada. I always have and it's not only because he's such a talented song writer and has fantastic songs, but his voice is so beautiful. He's really got it all and is totally underrated.This is a fantastic cd. It's a latin masterpiece. I love all the songs here but especially the fast dance track Ay Bueno and the slower ballads Una Senal, Cuando Despierto and the stunning Por Amor which is a duet with the great Gloria Estefan. That is a real treat.To be perfectly honest, I don't have a single clue what the heck he is singing about, but it is so gorgeous to listen to (with all those ballads he's definately singing about love), and it's got something for everyone - dance numbers and the stunning ballads we fans have become used to hearing from this great crooner. I love it."
4,love this watch!,"Although it looked almost like a child's watch when I first saw it, once I put it on my wrist, I loved it. Classic watch."
