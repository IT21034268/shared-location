3,Sesame Street Ball Pit,My son loves the ball pit but it only lasted about 3 weeks before the seams started to leak air.
3,Disappointed,"We havent had any problems keeping it inflated.... the problem lies in my son, who will be two next month, flipping it over and spreading 175 balls EVERYWHERE. He will not play with them in the pit, the game is dump them and make mommy pick them up so i can dump them again... Great toy.... if i could staple it to the floor. lol."
1,Stay away from this one!,This toy is not nearly durable enough to withstand moderate use from a 3 year old. Plastic panels started tearing about on day one. The entire thing tore and lost air within a few months of moderate use from the kids. CHEAP
1,Holes you can't repair,"I bought this for my two year old's 2nd birthday and he loved it. I was annoyed the bootom was only attached at the front and back so the balls kept spilling out the bottom sides,but he loved it so oh well. 2 weeks later it deflated in one of the front chambers and was all lopsided and would fall on him. We tried every night for a week to find the hole. We patched two areas at the seams where it was the potential culprit but it did no good. It was put in the trash while he was sleeping. So it was a huge waste of money and a heartbreaker"
2,Not worth it,"I was looking for a bouncer/ball pit which I can fill up with balls and have my daughter and if possible a couple of friends play in it. After I inflated, I saw that it is much much smaller then the pictures show. If you have a 2-3 year old and if you put her/him in...the whole thing gets filled up and there is not much playing or jumping or anything can be done. This unit is also very unstable and it can easily tip over. There are just 3 characters of Sesame street on it and nothing more. This seems like as waste of money."
1,Great Dissapoinment,"I purchased this item for my then [...]yr old son for Christmas, in the picture there are 3 kids playing and We thought it would be enough room for our 2 year old and a friend. Well after inflatng, it was alot smaller and only big enough for one child and the balls that came with it didn't even cover the bottom of the pit we found 100 balls at [...]. It took forever to inflate and then we realized it had a hole it it, the repair patch it came with did not work. I called and had a replacement sent only to receive it to find upon inflating that it had a hole in it almost in the exact same place as the first one. It is really cute but poorly constructed the curtains on the back of the ballpit easily pull apart and cause small tears in the ballpit. DON'T WASTE YOUT TIME WITH THIS ONE!!.."
1,Upset Grandma,"I sent this item to my grandson for the holidays although very cute, it was a waste of time and money to order this. The house had to be constantly blown up it did not retain the air. After three days and blowing it up 10 times we had to send it back."
2,Cheap Toy,"My son like it, but it is a cheap toy, I does not last more than a month. I have 1 for 20 days before I stated having problems with it, got a replacement one but it was not different. Do not buy it"
1,worthless,It didn't even last 24 hours before it split at the seams in several different spots. Don't waste your money.
3,Off The Deep End,"The Deep End, which promises to be a breathless Hitchcockian thriller, is mildly disappointing yet slightly unsettling. It is good and tense, has a few big shocks, and is over. Tilda Swinton, that visceral, ruddy-cheeked British actress from Orlando and The War Zone, gives a commendable performance as a soccer mom from Lake Tahoe caught in a mess of murder and blackmail. It's a meaty, complicated role, and she pulls it off nicely; she carries the entire film and manages to pull it off even when the plot gets a little slow. Rich with aquatic imagery throughout, filmed in cool blues and greens, it may not be a masterpiece, but it is fascinating if only because it deals with an ordinary woman plopped in the middle of a crime, willing to go to any lengths to protect her children."
3,Too many unexplained details,"Tilda Swinton turns in a fine performance as a mother who suspects her young son of murdering his gay lover. Unfortunately her performance is marred by the shortcomings of the film itself. There are too many unexplained details such as how her blackmailer obtains incriminating evidence about her son and why he needs an accomplice to collect the money from her. There are also some improbable situations such as the mother dumping the body into shallow water and the blackmailer turning friendly, so overall the film doesn't make much sense. To me part of the suspense of the film revolves around waiting for the writers to tie up the loose ends, but unfortunately this never happens."
1,"This Emperor has no clothes, folks","Don't be misled by some good reviews--this movie stinks.I like indie movies. I don't mind slow movies. Love suspense. I had great hopes for this.Boy, were those dashed.This film is about as illogical as they come. The central conceit is fundamentally hollow, there's one contrivance after another, and the filmmakers are much more interested in coincidence than suspense. Add in a juvenile fixation with water and insipid dialogue, and you've got a ruined Saturday night.And to those of you who've seen it, what the hell was that white flash before the credits? It was played as important , but was never explained or justified whatsoever.If you want to see an incredibly tight, twisty, suspenseful film with tangible sexual tension, rent BOUND instead."
3,"Not always exciting, but emotionally strong","Tilda Swinton received much-deserved critical accolades for her quietly desperate performance of a woman trying to protect her gay son. It isn't nearly as thrilling as some critics seem to suggest; in fact, it drags at times. Still, it is an unusual and intelligent movie.The film itself actually relies much less on its action sequences than on the performances of its actors, most of which are good, but all of which pail in comparison to Swinton's work as Margaret. Though she makes absurd and dangerous decisions, her love for her son makes those decisions believable, even when she tries to protect him from murder charges by involving herself with criminals. Some gay viewers will flinch at the depiction of shady characters in a gay bar, but we all know that you can find shady characters anywhere.(Duane Simolke's books include The Acorn Stories, Degranon, and New Readings of Winesburg, Ohio.)"
4,"Suspenseful, beautiful movie","A friend recommended this movie highly so I had high expectations.. When the movie started, I thought.. oh no.. I saw the previews of this and I said that I probably wouldn't like it... The movie was beautifully made.. the scenery is everything that I personnally am looking for as a place to live.. Tilda Swinton is amazing. Her tense face carries the movie and makes it totally believable.. even Nick's total turn around. As a mother I understood completely her actions even when logically disagreeing with them. One loose end though.. someone is still accused wrongly of the murder eventually which if we believe her character she will not be able to let go of so easily."
5,Brilliant movie,"The Deep End is a fascinating movie of desparate mother who will do anything to save her family. The movie has several side plots from issues of gay life style to intergenerational family problems.The movie starts quickly and does not pause. As the plot unfolds and the characters reveal themselves you are drawn into their lives more and more. The ending is a brilliant finish to a well written, directed and acted story.I recommend this for anyone beyond adolescence and for all who consider themselves open to the issues explored here."
1,Dead in the Water,This is a rare occasion where I disagree with Roger Ebert. I just don't see what's so great about this movie. It's very simple. The performances are good and some of the elements were interesting. Maybe I would appreciate it more if I read the book. By the end I was thankful it was over.
3,maternal love and fateful choices,"""The Deep End"", set at beautiful and highly photogenic Lake Tahoe, will absorb your interest. (As area residents, we must add that we had trouble orienting ourselves and some of the directions seemed reversed in the film.) This story of a mother's tender,protective love for her son and for all of her family, when faced with evil from without, is a tale with which every mother can identify. Yet Tilda Swanson's character, Margaret, seems to make a series of wrong choices without thinking through the repercussions. The moral ambiguity in ""The Deep End"" is troubling, and for this reason, I was left with a bad taste in my mouth. The film resembles ""In the Bedroom"" in the that sense."
4,Beautifully filmed noir piece,"I really like this film. First of all it is absolutely beautiful to look at. Tahoe and water water everywhere - all sumptuously photographed.The story is an emotionally intense rollercoaster of the lengths a mother will go to protect her children. Intense, often suspensful and sometimes creepy, this is a keeper.Swinton is amazing here - like one raw jangling nerve. SHe is amazing to watch. The rest of the cast is fine their roles, whether shady, clueless or sympathetic.Well worth a view."
3,"Not a total waste, but not a total winner either.","This film is a good example of justice being served. The baddies gets it by the end of the movie, and that's the main redeeming value. There are however, several flaws in the plot, including why the mother didn't just call the cops in the first place. We assume that it is because she wants to protect her son from murder charges, but with the broken railing and cause and time of death, the investigation should obviously yield the truth of what had happened. If she thought her son had actually murdered the victim, *why* didn't she even mention it to him?Again, not a total waste of time, but not a real winner either."
1,Terrible: Bad Acting and Awful Script,"I expected this to be an exciting mystery thriller. I had heard good reviews of the film. First of all the script was terrible. The dialog was very pitiful and made no sense. A high school kid in his first film class could do better. The acting was terrible. The actors seemed to be reading their one liners from the cue cards. If I didn't know better I would say they all neede to go back to acting school. They made a bad decision making this film it stinks. They had no inflection of charcter in any of the lines they read. The family did not communicate at all in this film which let to the hideous plot. The basis for the story could have been great. They had a good idea , but a terrible script and director. Do not waste your time or your money!"
1,worst acting ever,"You know how when you watch ""Showgirls"" it's to laugh at the horrible acting? Well, at least Showgirls is fun to watch."
1,One of the worst movies I HAVE EVER SEEN.,"My dad told me this would be a good movie...so i went to see it with him. It supposedly got really good reviews and everyone said it was beautiful, thrilling, and suspenseful. IT WAS NONE OF THE ABOVE. DO NOT go and waste your money on this movie. It will be the 2 most boring hours of your life."
2,Much more advanced than necessary for the actual test.,"This book really did a poor job of preparing me for the actual CBEST. The level of information the book focused on, especially in the math section, was much more advanced than anything that was on the actual test. This book would have you think the test was going to cover advanced mathematics principles, rather than basic high-school level math, which is what was actually covered. The reading and writing portions of this book were much more accurate in terms of the level of information tested on the CBEST."
5,Awsome!,By far the best book on runic metephysics ever written and by far exceeds the quality of any book on runes. Throw your Ralph Blum books and pop this one open......you will see why! Hail Odin!
5,"Those who know...know, those who don't know...find this disc",Finally TWISTED has released a house/jazz/tech compilation that won't be cycled through my collection in less than a year. This one's a keeper and I recommend it for any educated underground music connoisseur. It will be playing at our next afterhours set for sure. Mr. Yost has skills. PS: I'm patiently waiting for VOLUME 2!
3,a few gems,"To put my cards on the table, I'm a huge Billy Bragg fan. However the moments of genius are getting fewer and further between. This record is solid but unspectacular, with a few exceptions. ""Distant Shore"" is classic, heartfelt Billy Bragg, and the acoustic guitar work is gorgeous. ""Another Kind of Judy"" is this record's ""Sexuality"", and ""Jane Allen"" is a lot of fun. ""Baby Faroukh"" is a standout as well. Other than than that it's pretty average. ""NPWA"" is just awful musically. The lyrics are cool, but to me it's unlistenable. Bragg's live shows are still a killer, though, and I'm planning on being front and center when he comes to the States."
2,I guess the best days are past,"This album was a major disapointment. I am a long time fan and will admit that I had to work at the last album, but I have to say that he finally may have come to the end of his career. His voice even sounds a bit strained on this album and the songs are way too fluffy and trite. I went intothe purchase knowing that I was losing out, but aside from a few numbers (Union Jack) this album is not worth much. I went and saw him play with the Blokes (a band that I wish he would cut loose) last year and for the first time ever wanted to walk out. He butchered old songs and the new ones were painful...I'm sorry to see you go Billy."
4,I love it!,This is the first Billy Bragg CD I have purchased. I loved nearly every song and would therefore highly recommend it.
2,His worse release yet,"Unfortunately this is his poorest record to date. If you're already a fan, then I guess there are 1 or 2 half decent tracks. If you found Billy by accident by hearing the Mermaid Ave records, then buy any other of his great CDs, especially Don't Try This At Home. If you get a chance to see him live, then do so--he is a great performer. Also check out the web site Billy Bragg.com for tour dates, record releases and chat about Billy. Sorry this is a negative review but this is the only one of his many records that I haven't enjoyed."
3,Just correcting the record,"Contrary to the earlier reviewer's reference to Billy's age as ""under 40,"" he is at least 44 years old, maybe 45 by now."
4,Sir Thomas More,"A wonderful story and one that is inspirational. Sir More felt strongly enough about his convictions to leave his office and the power that went along with it so that he could remain loyal to his God. This version of the story does it great justice, showing Henry VIII for the tyrant he really was (although one who could be charming when he wanted to be) and the characters he surrounded himself with. The actors chosen for the roles in this film included many established actors as well as some very talented ones just making their mark. Certainly worth watching!"
3,a review for a man for all seasons,"I thought this movies deserved a 3. I feel that it was alittle non interesting and I don't think I was the only one. I mean the movie did have some interesting points, but not alot. This might of been good for an older crowd but for a young crowd of teenagers, it didn't really catch our eyes."
2,A Man For All Seasons,"What can I say about ""A Man For All Seasons?"" This movie was good, but I wasn't very interested in it. I felt that the whole plot was boring. The actors who portrayed the characters did a wonderful job. However, the movie was relevant to what I just learned in Morality, which was conscience. The movie shows how courageous Thomas More was to refuse the oath of the King, and not go against his conscience. If I had to choose a favorite character it would be Thomas More. He was an honest, moral man who stayed with what he believed was right. He depicts a good example of how people should act. I would only recommend this movie to people who would like to go back to this era in time."
1,ridiculous,"Interesting...over 200 people have rated this movie as 4.5 stars. So, the movie should be great...right?How can Amazon expect anyone to actually rent this movie if they have seen the incrediably LAME trailer.Amazon should think about providing viewers with better trailers. They aren't going to sell movies withtrailers like this. How about providing viewers with the first 10 minutes of the movie? That should hookthem, if the movie is any good."
4,"MORE ROBERT SHAW, PLEASE!","This film is excellent! They could not have picked better music, or costumes, nor scenes. If you are a fan of the time era, and people who lived then, get the film and enjoy! Only rebuke... Robert Shaw, who was nominated for best supporting actor for this film, has one big scene! That is it, that is all! However, the scene is very memorable! Perhaps it is more memorable that he was just in the one scene! None of the rest of the film, lives up to it! But I will say, memorable throughout, and the dramatic music is still in my head. Watch and enjoy a classic.KING HENRY THE EIGHTH, I AM!"
4,Magnificent!,"I deduct one star for only one reason: artifacts mostly visible against light areas, such the gray sky in the opening sequence, which do detract from the intended beauty of the cinematography.Otherwise, the play and screenplay are brilliant; the performances are brilliant; the movie is a must-see."
2,not at all enjoyable,"Terrible quality; mostly poor acting despite cast of supposed ""stars""; the script was almost comical at times. Is this what movies were like a few decades ago? This film must have had severe budget restrictions ..... like, $100k total."
4,Forgot how good a film this was,"Haven't seen A Man for All Seasons in a very long time so it was nice to see a proper historical epic done so well. None of the overblown dramatics most films seem to have these days, and a cast that could all act. They don't make films like that now."
3,dvd might have been defective,"This is an excellent movie, but the dvd inexplicably ""stalled"" in the middle of the movie. I had to fast-forward to see the rest of the movie. I have yet to go back and replay it to see if it will play all the way through, so there is still part I have missed."
4,Frustrating for the Historian,"Brilliantly made movie. Problem is it gives a total whitewash to More's character. We hear nothing about the man who chortled happily when Protestants were burned alive at the stake. Performances are brilliant as is the rest, but the characters are pure Hollywood melodrama"
2,Thomas More was no hero,"What should be said about a movie that is well made but grossly distorts the nature of the man it claims to portray? Thomas More in fact hated and betrayed many, putting his prejudices to evil work, ordering the torture and burning alive of men whose only crimes were disagreeing with his theology. One victim was tortured in More's garden with leather straps tied around his head and tightened until blood came from his eyes, then tortured further on the rack before being burned alive. Rather than Thomas More, his victims deserve praise, for their courage and sacrifice for the sake of simple faith and truth. For some real history (not Hollywood!) consider reading David Daniell's life of Tyndale, the courageous and brilliant scholar and translator of the Bible into English, for a fascinating picture of the greatness of one man whom More chose to hate."
2,"Great movie, but a caution...","Excellent acting. Draws you in. Makes you think. But I want to share a caution that may seem minor to many people, but it bothers me personally and I know it bothers others: God's name is used in vain in the form of ""GD"" in this movie. I share that so that you will not be surprised like I was."
1,"Good movie, bad history","The acting is supurb in this rendition of the story of Sir Thomas More. However the history is very skewed. More was vindictive and cruel. Moral values that mattered were only his own. The Library of Congress had a display about William Tyndale some years ago. The polemics between Tyndale and More and very telling and not to More's credit. He may be a saint to some, but I have no doubt where in the cosmos his soul resides now while those he tortured to death are in heaven."
3,A Man For All Seasons Has True MORALITY For All Seasons,"A Man For All Seasons is a very good movie. I wouldn't say it was action packed and kept gripping you every moment that Thomas More appeared on the screen but it was definitely a true movie that showed a good, wholesome morality trip which is something that is desperately needed in today's society. Many people have this bad habit of ignoring their conscience and doing whatever they feel like doing, but I respect and admire Thomas More. He was a good Christian who never let the world change his morals OR his conscience. I would not say that A Man For All Seasons is the best movie I've ever seen but I must admit, if you want an insightful look deeper into your own of thinking about yourself, A Man For All Seasons then becomes a must-see-before-you-die-sometime-in-a-lifetime movie."
3,powera and wealth isnt everything,what wolsie said about loving God atleast half as much as he loved the king was true.. wolsie should have praised God ..God gives us what we have God is who we are..he shouldnt look to the liitle things in life like power and wealth but rather be thankul for our human soul;to reach salvation is to reach God and peacefulness forever
5,a film for all seasons,"Fred Zinneman's A MAN FOR ALL SEASONS is one of the great heights of cinema.Pressed for budget, Zinnman brough this masterpiece in for about $1-million. John Box, the Oscar winning designer and longtime associate of David Lean's, made magic with very little and Freddie Young offered up an example of why cinematography is surely an art in its self.And to top off brilliant performances, Zinneman selected composer Georges Delerue (ANNE OF A THOUSAND DAYS, THE BORGIAS) for the majestic, haunting score-- a score that sadly has never seen a soundtrack release.An inspiring film that surely gives a memorable celebration of the human spirit."
1,"cannot hear a sample, therefore will never purchase,","Impossible to rate because I cannot hear samples. Since you have spoiled us with samples of other albums, I feel much safer buying albums that I know I will enjoy.That is why I cannot rate it."
3,A good action story,"I really liked Callaghen for the most part. It's one of L'Amour's very typical stories that become very predictable after reading five or six. But it had a strong hero, which L'Amour was famous for, and I guess that's why so many people like to read his stuff. The guy I really like, that I kept comparing L'Amour's writing to while I read Callaghen, is a guy named Kirby Jonas, who critics are calling The New Louis L'Amour. I can see why they call him that, but even though I like L'Amour, Jonas's writing is much better and more authentic. He, too, scouts out the places in his books. He keeps them clean, too. Reading Callaghen, I feel like it's a book that was kind of L'Amour's staple, and Kirby Jonas has perfected this kind of book with similarly strong heroes but more believable. If you like Callaghen, give Kirby Jonas a try, too."
2,Started out great...,"when I first got his printer I was very pleased. One reason for buying it was the good reviews and that it was replacing an aging BJ6000 which used the same ink carts so I didn't have to waste all my old stock.Well, 10 months later and I need a new printhead. Not only are they expensive - you can't find them. when available, they routinely sell for $55+ on eBay and I have seen websites that list them for $85!! Hey, I only paid $125 for the machine in the first place.The only way for me to use it is to clean the heads before using it every day. As soon as my ink carts are done, I will be buying a replacement and it won't be a Canon."
2,Print Head Issues,"I owned this printer for 10 Months and I had to replace the Print Head 4 months ago, yesterday the print head went on me again. I will be throwing the 750 out the window. Guess I have to buy another printer now. Thanks Canon for another Great Product!!!"
5,Excellent Printer,"I bought this printer around the end of August '02 and I am very happy with it. The printer is easy to set up except for the instructions on how to align the printheads is a bit confusing. Once it was set up and the software installed the printer preformed flawlessly. Text is really fast and graphics come out fast as well. So far all of my printing has been done on ""normal"" quality and they look great. The individual ink tanks are helpfull so you can reduce waste. If you are looking for a great all-purpose printer this is the one to get. The printer does not come with a cable but if you have USB connections on your computer then Amazon sells a really great USB cable from Belkin ...(these thing are [more expensive] in stores) it comes in 6ft and 10ft lenghts.(I use the 10ft one) Amazon ASIN: B00000J1TX (6ft) or ASIN: B00004Z5M1 (10ft)."
1,Piece of junk,"I bought this piece of junk a year ago. It was fine for printing text, but photos always had lines running through them, no matter how many times I aligned the print head.Finally last week the nozzles clogged, and it was all over. I'm not about to spend $50 for a new print head. I'll get a new printer, and it won't be a Canon!"
1,Piece of crap,"This printer worked great -- WHILE IT WORKED. I've only owned it for 8 months and it's already broken. I have to take it into a computer servicing station to have something or other with the ink cratridges emptied out and cleaned - whoever heard of such inconvenient nonsense? Canon customer service was really of no help to me whatsoever. They weren't rude or anything, but didn't help at all. I would have never bought the thing in the first place. Waste of time and money."
3,Nice printer but mine was defective,"Set up was easy, instructions clear. The first page I printed was part good and part totally messed up. Called customer support, wasn't kept on hold too long, operator was pleasant and sufficiently knowledgable. She diagnosed the problem as a defective ""encoder."" I returned the printer [company]. My impression from the test pages was that the quality of text and images would be fair to good but not great."
4,Almost exactly as expected,"I read many reviews prior to purchasing this printer. Having always been an HP printer owner, I wasn't sure about making the switch. This printer is fast and prints great color photos. The only slight hassle is downloading the driver for Mac OS Xfrom the Canon web page. So far I'm very satisfied and am considering the purchase of another for my son to take to college."
3,Canon S750 For Mac Users may not be the answer.,"For Mac Users/ Re Canon S750 / after talking to Canon tech support... Drawback #1. I only get a max of 6 ppm on b/w although they say up to 20 ppm with b/w, the response was ... it was a mac issue. (I have a PPC 450 mhz, USB, fairly new, so this should not be an issue.) Drawback #2 They did not incorporate a page preview, so you must rely on the application having a page preview. Drawback #3 Unable to select Black and White print only. #4 Takes 20-30 seconds before paper moves into printing position, then it's the 6 ppm. The quality is a 10, but for offices that just want a quick copy and not a master piece, this may not be the one for you."
3,Printer Heads,"I bought the s750 within the last year, and it stopped printing black lnk. The Technical desk informed me after trouble shooting that the head was most likely bad. To my dismay when I took the printer in to an authorized service center there were three more S750 waiting for a new printer head. The repair tech informed me that he has repaired alot of the S750 series. Maybe a design problem?"
3,Printhead Problems,I have also had printhead problems with mine. It has worked great for 2 years but just gave out on me recently. I wouldn't mind buying a new printhead but I can't find any available on the internet and I would hate to have to pay half the price of the printer to get one. My printer will not print any color except blue and everything I print has white lines through it. I would recommend not purchasing one of these unless the defect is fixed.
4,It's okay but not the greatest,"This printer was one of the better buys I've made lately. It is all around a good printer. My only complaint is that when I print out photographs using the software provided with the printer it pixelizes out, no matter how it looks on the screen. It is barely noticeable unless you really look close though. I would recommend this printer to amateur or casual users."
1,Stopped Printing Black,"You can tell from the other reviews that this printhead is a piece of junk. It regularly fails on printing black. Before buying another Canon product, read the reviews. Save yourself a lot of trouble."
2,Print head problems,"The printer is great while it works, no question about it. Quite fast, good quality. I mostly used it for black&white documents so I cannot say much. BUT DON'T BUY IT since in 15 months time the print head died, and of course it was out of warranty. Funny how the all electonics die right after their warranties expire... Anyway, I think Canon has discnontinued this model (no wonder) so that makes me just one more unlucky victim."
2,Print Head Problems,"My S750 also stopped printing black. I had not used it in about 2 months, so probably the ink got clogged, but since the other colors printed fine, I think it's a problem with the print head design. Otherwise, when working it prints great."
1,Garbage,"I owned this printer for 15 months and its already broke. I used it for grayscale printing. The people at Canon suggest I purchase a new printhead for $55.00, they can keep their printhead, I will by another printer and it won't be a Canon!This printer had excellent reviews in consumer reports, I am very disappointed that I followed their recommendation. What a waste of $169.00!"
1,Canon S750 color printer,From day one this printer has not performed well. Had to have a new print head and other items after using for 1 month. Colors are not true and when you print photo's quality is very poor. I had an old 895c HP that did much better than this highly touted printer. I understand they have discontinued this model after only being out for little over a year if that long. [...]
2,Printer Wears Out!,"I had this printer for about a year, and I bought it at a very good price (after a mail-in rebate) and I must say that even with the significantly reduced price it was still not worth the money. The print quality does go down dramatically after the 1 year mark and my printer just stopped working (or printed in horrible green tints).I would not recommend this product to anyone."
2,Another Print Head Failure,"This printer worked fine for about a whole year since I owned it. Several weeks ago, it started to streak the black ink. I changed the black ink cartridge to a brand new cartridge and still the same result. Despite reading numerous positive reviews online, I also found out about a possible defective printhead? The color tanks print fine, but the black is definitely defective."
4,Great Printer,"Is is the fastest, best priced ink jet printer I have found. I use it at work for typical printer, both color and black & white. It has been especially useful printing odd size stationary and envelopes, something the HP's do not do well at all. I bought it through the Amazon.com []and I am mad I did not buy about 5 for the office."
5,my favorite printer,"I have recommended this printer to all of my friends and family. It is the best printer I have ever had. It is very convenient: never jams, ink cartridges are easy to change, prints different sizes of paper well.It prints black and whites quickly and quietly, and with premium picture paper, prints photos with extraordinary quality.I can't imagine that there is another printer out there of the same quality for a lower price."
1,bum printer,"I would have rated this printer with 5 stars when I bought it for print quality & speed, but after less than a year of very light use I too am suffering from a buggered print head. Thanks to the other reviews on amazon I shall not waste my time replacing the print head but shall begin the search for a new printer, and it won't be another canon."
2,Undun Songbook,"This is the first Hal Leonard published book I have been dissapointed with, however this is coming from a guitarist perspective. First, the songs are not in the correct Keys as compared to the recordings. Second, the guitar chords are named but not charted, therefore the fingering is elusive. No solos are included either. Though none of the songs are very difficult to pick out by ear I was hoping to save some time and effort. The arrangements, lyrics, piano seem accurate. Half of the included songs are on the ""Best of Guess Who"" CD."
1,This clock does NOT have Indiglo,"It's fine as a travel clock, but I bought it because the description said it had Indiglo. It does not. You have to press the light button to light up the display. If you want a backlit travel alarm, it's fine. Very disappointing. If the listing is corrected it'd be 4 stars.Update: October 29, 2010Now the backlight doesn't work at all. I thought it wasn't lighting up because the batteries might be low. Nope, new batteries in and no light. FAIL. One star, look elsewhere.Now it's too late to order one for my upcoming trip."
2,Must have gotten a lemon,"So all I wanted was a cheap battery alarm clock for a camper. This thing eats up a battery every few days - at least once or twice a week. It works great otherwise - maybe I received a ""lemon"" but I cannot keep feeding it so will have to get another brand."
3,"It's alright, but may not be the best choice for a Senior citizen","I am slightly hard of hearing, and have trouble hearing the alarm above my C-Pap machine. I also have difficulty finding the right spot between having the alarm off and having it on."
1,Stopped working after 6 weeks,"I put this travel clock in my kids' bathroom, so they could tell the time when they get ready for school. After about 6 weeks, one of the numbers stopped working. So, my clock read 7:_5. Not much help for the kids. I contacted Amazon and they issued a refund immediately. So, I give 5 starts to Amazon, but only 1 to the product"
2,OK for traveling,The quality is not good but OK for traveling for the price we paid and can the do the job we want.
3,4 minute snooze & more,"I didn't see this anywhere before I bought this item, but it only snoozes for 4 minutes. It has an annoying alarm that is sure to wake and irritate you and when you press snooze (or turn on the night light) it emits a high pitch whine that is sure to drive away dogs. It has a single alarm that is easy to set. It is small and folds up for travel."
1,Doesn't Keep Time!,"I was glad I found this little clock on Amazon, because it seemed to be exactly what I was looking for. Elgin is a reputable name in timepieces. Unfortunately, the clock gained about 15 minutes every five hours! I tested it more than once. I was so disappointed. Had to return it. Still looking for something like it. I need something simple, folding, battery-operated, a clock that can keep accurate time (!) and with a light that comes on when pressed. Unfortunately, it was not to be with this one. I don't usually write reviews, but felt obligated to report my recent experience with this model."
4,basic and good,"A basically featured travel alarm clock(clock/alarm/snooze/folds). Simple to use. Takes two AAA (the old style only took one, so it is a little heavier) I encountered some confusion re the number of batteries required reading specs. There are quite a few travel alarms out there with more features ie. temp and auto setting,etc., but none had the good night visibility indiglo lighting this one had. For me that made the difference."
4,Nice price reduction,"Clock worked but I had to remove and reinsert batteries to get the indiglo (which is very bright) and alarm to work - weird. Alarm could be a little louder at peak level (alarm lasts 1 minute). For the money, tough to beat. Recommended unless you're a heavy sleeper."
1,why would they make such a lousy product?,"A horrible, useless clock. There's no light, so you can't read the damn thing when you wake in the middle of the night, and the cheap plastic frame broke the first time I used it. I'd return it for a refund, but for ten bucks, I'll just toss it and post this review. Do NOT waste your money.If I were Elgin, I'd be ashamed. I certainly will buy any Elgin product after being ripped off like this."
1,display doesn't work,"I don't know if this was peculiar to the clock I received, but the displays are funny. When I have it on ""alarm off"", it displays the alarm time, not the real time. Therefore, I always have to keep it on ""alarm on"" which is annoying on the days I want to sleep in. I even tried keeping it on ""time set"", but the alarm still went off. And on ""alarm set"" it just shows the alarm setting and not the time. Very confusing and irritating."
2,Ran behind and quit after 8 months!,"Sure it was only 8 bucks, but I expected a little travel clock to be more dependable. From the start it lost a minute every few days, but I lived with it. Then suddenly the display went out (after only 8 months)--and yes, I tried new batteries. Don't believe I'll buy Elgin again."
2,Inexpensive and Cheap.,"I bought this clock for the large display and the backlight feature, but the clock arrived with the backlight nonfunctioning. As it turns out, the display isn't that large or legible in low light. I'd advise another choice."
2,Broken Display,Received this clock a few days ago and was hoping to take it on my upcoming trip. The display is defective and barely works with brand new batteries inside. Looks very useful and easy to use otherwise. Will be exchanging and hoping the next one is better.
3,Feels cheap but this does not affect the operation.,"The alarm on-off switch is combined with the switch for setting the time and alarm.Not a big problem, but when you are half asleep it would be easy to change the time or alarm when turning the alarm on or off.Also, the switch feels cheap.It is OK but next time I would go with a different clock."
1,Alarm disappeared,Bought Alarm clock for primary use of alarm use in travel. Checked alarm when I received clock and it worked fine. I then went to Europe for five weeks and within a few days the alarm sound quit. Clock was fine but I bought it to have an alarm while traveling and therefore the clock became useless. Of course I'm not going to return it while I am in Europe and for the great low price it would hardly be worth the effort.
2,"Works fine, if you don't mind being unable to see the numbers.","It's hard to fathom a travel alarm clock that does everything perfectly except for showing the numbers on the clock face, and yet here we are.The alarm is loud and clear. The unit keeps time very well, and doesn't get slow or fast at any point. Batteries last forever in this thing, despite me replacing them time and time again. Why would I do that, you ask?The digits on the clock face are illegibly soft and faded. You have to tilt the unit at an almost 90 degree angle to get the numbers to show up visibly enough for you to discern which numbers they actually ARE. Considering I can't reach it sometimes (y'know, because I'm in bed, or across the room), this is a bit of a flaw. Call me nutty, but I like to see my clock's clock numbers.Ultimately, this is one great travel alarm clock for all the blind travelers in your life."
2,One Minute Alarm??,"Seriously, an alarm that sounds for a total of one minute?? I'm a fairly heavy sleeper and I would be scared to depend on this alarm to wake me for anything. The alarm is not very loud to begin with, and only goes off for one minute (timed by a stopwatch). Unless you're one of those people that wake up very easily, avoid this alarm at all costs!!"
1,Terrible,I was hoping it worked...I am not that demanding. It didn't work and still doesnt. It is just too cheaply made
1,Good luck,"I bought it for the ""big rig"" as a travel clock while i'm on the road. Worked 1 day then stopped working.It seemed to be well made (as much as electronics are these days) but since it stopped working I cannot vouch for it's usefulness. Avoid it IMO."
4,Nice basic travel clock,"What I like best about the Elgin travel alarm clock is the large, blue back-lit display. The slide buttons to set the alarm and time are a little tricky to use because they tend to stick a little, but it is not enough of a problem for me to give it a lower rating. The exterior is hard plastic and I would have liked it to feel a little sturdier, but it keeps the weight and price down. All in all not a bad product."
3,Okay for the price,"This is a pretty decent little alarm clock. It's been reliable. The sound of the alarm is a beep which is loud enough to wake you without being too jarring. I absolutely love the indigo lighted display which is easy on the eyes. The button to turn on the indigo display is a great size and centrally located, but I don't like how small and cumbersome the other buttons are. Even though the unit is small, I feel the design of the other buttons could have been a little more user friendly for the sleepy, often one-eye-open user of the clock."
4,Elgin travel alarm clock,This is a nice little alarm clock. The button to set the time and alarm could be a little bigger.
3,Not as good as expected,"Some reviewers may be talking about a different clock, but this one DOES NOT start out softly and get louder. It is simply loud from the start. The packaging notes it is an ""ascending alarm"", but this just means it beeps more frequently if you don't shut it off. True, it is simple to operate and the numbers are nice and big, but it looks and feels cheap. I really wanted something that would wake me gently (at least initially) and this is not it!"
4,small & does the job,"This is a great little clock, weighs almost nothing & takes up very little space. The stand on the bottom can fold over to protect the buttons & keep from draining the battery while it is packed. I love the bright blue face, but you won't see it unless you hit the oval button on the front. It stays lit up for 1 second, that's it! I wish the light up feature lasted 5 or 10 seconds instead. Snooze button will give you 4 minutes, that's it. Almost not worth hitting the snooze button for. But it works & the price is right."
4,Works and is affordable,"I'm studying abroad in France, and needed a very handy, light, alarm clock that worked properly. It arrived in the time, I was told it was going to arrive, and came with easy, straight-forward instructions. At first, I was a little worried because I'm a very heavy sleeper, and need a an alarm clock whose alarm can accommodate that. On a test run, the alarm seemed too weak, however, when I actually set it to wake me up one morning, the alarm worked fine. I woke up. It's been a month now, and it still wakes me up just fine and it shows no sign of breaking. Overall, I'm happy with this alarm clock.Also, let's not forget, times are rough these days, especially for a student financially. This alarm clock is a cheap, great buy."
1,Cheap Junk,"It was OK while it lasted - about four months. It's amazing to me how difficult it is to find a simple, reliable travel alarm that might last, oh, a year or two?:sheesh:"
2,Maybe consider something better,"I got this and it is light but it does not a feature to leave the light turned on. I found that this was not helpful. Also, it looks like you cannot see AM or PM when you set the alarm. That definitely does not help."
2,Not for the occularly challenged!,"The photo shows white lettering underneath the controls, but there IS no white. It's black like the clock itself, which makes it extremely difficult to see if you don't have 20/20 vision. I needed my reading glasses just to set the alarm. I will be sending this back."
5,Great clock.,"This is a great clock,small and lightweight I would buy it again or give to family or friends that travel a lot."
4,Cool alarm,"It works, but my favorite feature is that it glows an angry red as it's going off, as if to say ""GET UP NOW YOU LAZY ..."""
2,Not Permanently Backlit,"I bought this clock so that I could see the time in the dark. Since I can't always reach or find the thing, I need it to be permanently back lit and that's why I bought it. Anyway, I guess that's my mistake and so this thing is useless to me."
1,Light doesn't work,The backlight doesn't work. It was given as a gift. I will now need to replace it after the date.
1,"Thought I could trust the brand ""Elgin"" but ....","OKAY OKAY I admit I bought this on the cheap hoping the brand ""ELGIN"" would give me a good product. Look, you're only reading this because you're shopping on the cheap also. Stop. Don't buy one. Read the other one star reviews. They all have different problems with the alarm clock. Wish I read the one stars first.Anyway my issue is that the alarm is so very very faint and soft I cannot hear it. Called the company and they said it is a rather soft alarm but it flashes red. How does that wake me up? Anyway they told me to keep it and they're shipping another.Spend another buck or two or learn your own lesson."
3,"No frills, loud alarm clock","As others have noted, this is a no frills alarm clock that is easy to set and does what it's supposed to do. If you want an attractive clock, this is not the one for you. The plastic looks cheap, and it was slightly bulkier than I expected. My only real issue with it was the alarm. I prefer my initial alarm sound to be a gentle peep that gradually increases in intensity--I don't want my alarm disturbing the hotel guest in the next room. This is loud and obnoxious from the start. If you're a deep sleeper, the Elgin Travel Alarm Clock is the one for you."
1,garbage,"The clock flashes a frightening red color when it goes off in the morning-first surprise. Then the batteries died, so I replaced them, but after two days the backlight stopped working, the numbers faded to the point where I could barely see them, and the volume became so low I could barely hear it."
2,Alarm Flashes Red!,"I bought this alarm a few months ago. Since then i've gone back and read more reviews to see if i missed something somewhere. But nowhere, not in the description, not in the reviews, did i read that when the alarm goes off the display flashes RED. I have to say, it's quite disconcerting at ""oh goodness-thirty"" in the morning! Because of this, my search for a new alarm continues.On the plus side, i had no other issues with it and i didn't waste too much money."
2,"Too big, not loud enough","The controls are good and I like the way the display lights up when you press the snooze light. But this is not really a good travel alarm, it is too big and clunky. And the alarm is not very loud. I bought this clock because some of the other reviews said that the alarm was loud, but it is not. It might work as a regular bedside alarm if you are a light sleeper. I ended up buying a little Casio travel alarm, it is so much better, much smaller size and loud alarm."
3,"Cheap, but does the trick","This thing is as cheap as it looks. Definitely getting what you paid for. It is nice cause its small, doesn't take up a lot of room, perfect if you don't want to use your cell phone alarm. Unfortunately this alarm clock only has a 5 minute snooze. I still say it gets the job done."
2,"It nice, but","For the most part, I like the alarm clock. It's easily programed, doesn't have odd battery requirements. Alarm noise is annoying enough to get me moving. The 2 things I don't care for; 1 - the Indiglo feature is fine for seeing the time, but it felects badly off the not lit face plate & makes it difficult to see those details (ie, I want to change the alarm time without turning the light on and waking up my husband); 2 - the cover for the batteries comes off with very little effort, so when I'm fumbling to turn of the alarm (I'm half blind w/o my glasses) I knock the battery cover off & have to reset the whole thing. Duct Tape does seem to have served it's purpose once again."
4,Alarm Clock,"The alarm clock is very good. It isn't obnoxiously loud, which I like. Not only does it beep, but the light also flashes. My only dislike is that the SNOOZE isn't very long. It is only 4 minutes. I would prefer more time than that. But it does get me out of bed. It small and portable, so I bring it with me when I travel because of the convenience. It seems to be a good product."
4,Just what I needed...,"This little clock was exactly what I expected and seems to work fine, so far. The blue backlight is nice. One small complaint - I don't think QA is tops on the list with the maufacturer - on mine, the snooze button is upside down! It still works, just looks a bit odd. But what can you expect for the price?"
4,"Simple, Good Alarm","A good, simple alarm, easy to set and read. A somewhat louder alarm would be more appealing."
5,Mighty Mini,"I purchased this travel alarm for my daughter, who was heading off to Thailand for a year. It's small, it's easy to use, and it came within the time frame needed to leave with her on her flight overseas. The price was perfect! Everything we'd seen in the stores was in the $20 range, and she was thrilled to pay less than half that for this little wonder."
4,handy and dependable,"Purchased two of these for a trip overseas. The clock is lightweight, easy to set and dependable. And cheap..."
2,Cheaply made,This is a very cheaply made clock. The back light on mine does not work. It does tell time though and the alarm seems to work ok.
1,Junk,This clock never worked. The light didn't come on and the alarm made no sound. This is a piece of junk. I am surprised Amazon would sell this clock it is such poor quality.
1,A Piece of Junk,It worked only once when received it. Next day took it on trip and did not work since then. The LED light did not work (can't read time in the dark) and the alarm did not work either. Give one star due to the credit that it's still at least display the time.
1,Piece of crap,"This is the second time I buy an alarm clock from Amazon (I love Amazon, don't get me wrong, I really in the hundreds of things i have ordered, only had problems on a few occasions, and they always rectify it) that is garbage. I was desperately looking for something NOT made in China, which is pretty impossible. The first time I let it go... but because the first one i ordered is not reliable, because some times it doesn't go off, and I desperately need to wake up very early in the AM for training, as I am an athlete, So i bought this crappy one as back up. It doesn;t work. I have tried 8 sets of brand new batteries, i can BARELY read the time on it, it doesn't lit up, the alarm doesn't go off... don't buy this garbage!!!"
2,Poor snoozing resulted in return,"This little alarm clock is OK but there are 2 main flaws with it. First and foremost I sleep deeply and snooze a lot before finally waking. This clock only allows 4 snoozes, 4 minutes apart, before the alarm just stops going off. Also, when you have a travel alarm clock with a fold over cover like this please put a gap and a slight hole so the snooze button can be hit immediately without opening the cover. My girlfriend has an alarm clock almost identical to this from Timex that has long since been discontinued and it handles all these feature perfectly. You'd think something so simple would be easy to find. Hopefully they improve this one someday. In all other ways the clock was great."
2,Disappointed,"Received this as a Christmas gift. It worked fine, but 10 months later there was no backlight and the alarm didn't work. I tried new batteries, but that didn't fix the problem. If you want a travel clock that you can see during the daytime only, this is the one for you."
2,Did not work correctly,"This item is made very cheaply, and the back light did not work at all, which I wanted to use at night. Would not order again."
1,mine broke day two,"mine broke day two. on day one, it didn't keep time for a while but later on in the day, after resetting time, it kept time okay. on day two, it only backlit a slight amount and i could not see the display (time numbers). using brand new out of the pack batteries."
1,Will wake only the lightest sleeper,Hve not tried it at wakeup but can tell by testing I would sleep right through it. And I'm not a real heavy sleeper. Alarm only sounds for about 30-45 sec. I would return but already threw away packaging not anticipating this problem. Does flash red during the wakeup sound but if your asleep I don't think that is a big deal!
4,Funny and heartwarming.,"Hannah and Her Sisters is Woody Allen's third best film (Annie Hall and Manhattan are 1 and 2) I liked this film, it is quirky and touching. The best performance goes to Dianne Weist, she is such a natural, she's cute and refreshing in this film. Michael Caine is also good as well, I just wish Mia Farrow wasn't in this, she brings down the film with her sour facial expressions. Lovely romantic comedy for new and old fans of Allen's work."
5,Allen's Best,I have owned the video for several years and just purchased the DVD. Hannah and Her Sisters far exceeds Anne Hall as my favorite Allen picture. Such a joy. And the DVD is wonderful!
5,"Thousands of reviews of this film, millions who've seen it....","And I suspect they will keep on coming. Woody always wanted to create a synthesis between his famous ""wisecracking"" style and the serious drama of Scandinavian directors such as Ingmar Bergman, he also wanted to created a portrait of a ""fully rounded personality"". Well he didnt succeed. He created five. Hannah ( Mia Farrow) , her sisters ( Barbara Hershey and Diane Wiest). Hannah's mixed up husband ( Michael Caine) and of course himself. I've seen this film so many times these characters have become part of my family.And there are many others - Hannah's parents - I haven't even mentioned. I don't think it's possible to make a cinematic film that could be better than ""Hannah and her Sisters"". It has no axe to grind, it doesn't take sides, it's beautifully acted, it's funny, it's touching, it's serious but then again not...If you haven't yet seen it, where have you been living the past couple of decades....?"
4,"Angst, Love, and Dysfunction","An impressive movie by Woody Allen, which is more about a neurotic New York intellectual without any solid grounding in any particular morality or religion (How could you possibly think that Allen's character in this film and Allen are in any way similar?) than about Hannah and her sisters. Although Hannah and her sisters are also neither moral, nor religious fanatics. This is one of Allen's best dysfunction fests that brilliantly shows how people search for purpose and meaning in life, how they struggle for their happiness and how they lose and find each other in most unexpected ways. I definitley recommend this movie."
5,Woody at his best,"This is my favorite of Woody Allen's films, for a few reasons, but I think the single biggest one is a line delivered by Max Von Sydow: ""I turned on the telivision today for the first time in years, and just changed the channels. It was horrifying. Deoderant ads, soap operas, professional wrestling. There are people that watch professional wrestling as an entertainment? But the worst were the televangelists: 'Jesus says' this and 'Jesus says' that. 'Give money for Jesus.' If Jesus came back and saw what was going on in his name, he'd never stop throwing up."""
5,"For my money, only behind 'Annie Hall' in all Allen's films","A wonderful mix of moving and funny, thought provoking and silly. There's amazing acting all around from the first rate ensemble cast including Diane Wiest, Michael Caine (both of whom deservedly won Oscars), Max Von Sydow, Allen, Mia Farrow, Barbara Hershey etc.(Mild spoiler) It features a rare movie happy ending that's actually earned!This is probably the closest to 'Annie Hall' of all Woody Allen films in the mix of wit, technical proficiency, sophisticated stoty-telling, acting, emotion, etc. He takes a bevy of characters and creates a complex heartfelt portrait of family, lovers, friends, and artists that's funny but with insightful bite. A rare film that acknowledges how wonderful life is, without denying how hard it can be at the same time. Or at least how hard we find ways to make it."
3,"Great film, terrible DVD transfer","This is a wonderful film. All the films in the new Woody Allen boxset are wonderful films. But am I just imagining things? I just watched ""Hannah and Her Sisters"" and I was amazed at how washed-out it looked. Take a look at the very first scene -- it's far too light, Barbara Hershey looks sick, the warmth of the original film is gone. The video transfer was far superior, unless my memory is playing tricks on me. Has anyone else noticed this?"
1,Not What I Expected,"I bought this movie based on it's reviews and I have to say that I was disappointed. I really thought that it was going to be a great movie, but it wasn't for me. I really wish I could get those two hours I spent watching this train wreck back. I say if your interested in purchasing a Woody Allen film rented it first, then buy it if you like it. Just because it's a Woody Allen movie doesn't mean it's a great movie not all of his movies are gems. If you've watched some of his formula romantic comedies this one is not for you and you can take that to the bank."
3,Not in color.,"I must have been careless in reading the details about this book, as I didn't realize that the illustrations would not be in color until I actually opened the book. It had a lot of basic good information about sharks in it, but I never would have purchased it for my grand-daughter had I known the pictures were only ink drawings."
1,Downloaded Version Unwatchable,"Downloaded version is in cartoon colors. Not just off hues, but unwatchable florescent reds and yellows."
3,Give me a break,"Ralph Macchio is one of the worst actors Hollywood ever put on the screen. He either overacts everything or is a complete ham. This movie is the pinnacle of his career. This flick is about as realistic as a Friday the 13th movie.First of all I cannot believe a karate school run by a sensai as portrayed in this movie could possibly exist. No one is going to pay hard earned money for that kind of abuse. Secondly, a karate student abusing his skills on people would be severely punished or banned from further classes. The sensai in this movie is a stereotypical loon left over from the Vietnam War. The only viewing pleasure this movie has is Mr. Mayagi. Pat Morita is not the propritor of Al's anymore from Happy Days. He plays a wise and noble charactor that has to cool the jets of hot headed Ralph.The final contest is a bit far-fetched and the final blow has become a cliched joke."
1,"A Purely ""DVD"" Review","I see all of these reviews giving this DVD 5 stars and I have to laugh. No widescreen, sub-standard pan-and-scan print, lack of any quality extras (and this was a 2nd release of this film!) sounds like a VHS review---perhaps these reviews are for that. DVD means widescreen---period! With the exception of the older movies that were filmed in fullscreen (i.e. ""Citizen Kane"" or ""On The Water Front"" -- two well-made DVDs btw) no movie, not a one, should be released if there isn't a widescreen version on it---certainly a movie shouldn't ever be released TWICE with both versions fullscreen.... Rumor has it that they have been unable to find a useable widescreen version of this film (hard to believe isn't it?) to use for a DVD, but in that case be up front about it and quit releasing this POS version on DVD---do it a third time and heads will roll."
4,to be re-released as a box set?,"Now that none of the K2's are available, I can only assume the studio that has distributor rights to the series (Columbia/Tristar) will probably re-release all three or four films as a box set. Is that a good thing? Considering the first two are of any relevance, its a good way for the studios to recover any money for the last two. This is simlar to how 'Back to the Future' and the 'Pink Panthers' have been re-released. Let's hope the studio releases K-Kid I in widescreen and with additional content."
5,A pleasure to watch,"This is one of my all-time favorite movies. It's exciting, fun and full of life. A classic for all ages and times!!!"
5,A minor classic!,"It's a little surprising to realize that ""The Karate Kid"" is now 24 years old. Made in 1984, it still holds its own in 2008. In fact, it's a LOT better than many of the movies being churned out today.Why? For me, it's simply the excellent acting. Somehow, the chemistry between ""Daniel-san"" and ""Mister Miyagi"" is excellent, and memorable. Without this, the movie would have been forgotten decades ago.""Daniel's"" mother also does an excellent job, deftly managing to portray a total airhead without so much as a hint that anything is wrong. (What DID happen to Daniel's father, anyway?)To my mind (and time will tell) this re-make of ""Rocky"" is, oddly enough, a lot better than the original! That doesn't happen very often!A very high recommendation, especially if you are getting tired of films full of nothing but explosions."
1,"I want this movie, but...","I think it needs to be said again --- what's a great movie like this doing only available as a chopped up pan&scan version? Especially considering the lower quality sequels are available widescreen?I really want to buy this movie, but I can't justify buying such a poor DVD that doesn't show the entire movie."
5,MUCH BETTER THEN YOU WOULD THINK!,"I hadn't seen this film in 20 years and I am amazed at how well it has held up! Macchio and Morita give excellent performances in this ""Rocky"" type underdog movie for kids. The thing is, it isn't really just for kids!The uplifting story and acting ring true to anyone who was ever a ""new kid"" or picked on. It has made me want to re-visit the whole series!....Here we go again!"
4,The 80s are back in action,This film is great.You can learn a lot from it.The 'wax on wax off' thing is exellent.It is a great family entatainment
3,80s predictable.,"I never saw this movie when it first came out. So, I thought I would give it a try given all of the ""woven into the fabric of America"" stuff that came out of it. You know..""wax on, was off"", etc...I even remember people back in the 80s telling me how really good it was. I guess our standards were a little lower back then. The bullies in this movie are horrible actors. They ""overact"" every scene and have really bad 80s hairstyles. The only good thing about this movie is the way the ""Karate Kid"" learns from Mr. Miagi. (or however you spell it) Other than that, its a very predictible plot chocked full of annoying 80s music. As I watched it, I was trying to accept it for what it is... A predictable, corny, 80s romp through teen puberty with a life lesson thrown in for good measure. Compared to some of the trash that is coming out these days, I guess it's not all that bad."
5,I love this movie!,"This is another all time favorite. Daniel is an inspriation in this movie. He goes from living in a new place, being the underdog to being ""The Karate Kid""I like how he doesn't give up and keeps fighting to get to his goal. He learns the art of Karate by his wise and caring teacher.He not only wins the fighting match, but he wins the girl too!This movie will always hold a special place in my memories."
4,"wax-on, wax-off....","When I watched KK for the first time ,it was'nt like other kung-fu movie's my friends and I use to watch on Saturday afternoon's .This movie showed what martial-artist probably experienced before becoming Bruce Lee's and Van Damme's . After not have seen the movie since my younger days , it brought back the memories of how my friends and I would play kung-fu and one of us would use that infamous kick stance that never was effective . Anyways, this movie struck the days of innocents for me and reminded me of patience and it's virtues. Definitely an must-have to add to your karate flick collection !"
5,Wonderful Martial Arts classic !,"This movie is about Daniel (Macchio) who moves too L.A from New Jersey he trys everything too fit in with the crowd that was until he met Ali and he thinks she is all out awesome that is until one night at the beach Johnny who was once Ali 's boyfriend spots Daniel with her and launches a attack Ali trys too reason with Johnny but it doesn't work ,the next day Daniel visit his next door nebighor MR Myagi ,Daniel begs for him too teach him karate Myagi agrees ,as he teaches him Daniel devolps a friendship with his instructor will Daniel win Ali?Will Johnny win Ali back ?Find out in this wonderful Martial Art Classic THE KARATE KID !"
5,The Karate Kid,"""Find the balance."" This movie was definety in balance. I for one enjoyed every moment of it. The acting is brillent ( I should know because I'm an actor in training). Ralph Macchio (The Outsiders, Up The Acadamy, My Cousion Vinny,Too Much Sun) plays Daniel Larusso, the weakling from New Jersy who wants to learn karate to impress his new girlfriend. At the end however Daniel learns more than just karate. He learns that it is important to have balance in life and that fighting id the last answer to a problem. Like I said before the video is great. it carries and important message and will keep you feeling good all day."
1,Transfer quality,Please note...this review is for the quality of the transfer of the original film to DVD. It is awful! It almost seems they used a low resolution camcorder and recorded it from a movie theater screen. The thousands of black specks in the blue sky at the very beginning of the movie were very obtrusive. If you have a high resolution television it will only make the inferior quality of this DVD more noticeable.
1,No widescreen?!?!?!,"What's the deal releasing this movie on full screen? It's a classic film that I've seen about 100 times but I will not be buying this DVD, until it gets what it deserves. Widescreen, commentaries, deleted scenes? Come on, I expect so much more. Until then I'll stick with my VHS copy."
4,excellent screenwriting tool...,"For new writers looking for on how to structure their scripts, you can stop right here. Classic set-up and pay-off, as a bullied kid learns not just self-defense but discipline by the most unlikely of sources. Take a short, quiet, little Asian man, with plenty of fortune-cookie-isms and you have one of the more memorable characters in screen history. Daniel is your teen angst, but Miyagi is your masterful voice of reason.So if you're new to writing watch this film again if you don't know it by heart :). (...)"
3,Need to be WIDE SCREEN EDITION!!!!,"I bought this DVD a year ago... Movie itself is awesome. But I was disappointed it was regular 4:3 screen format... Then I heard that ""The Karate Kid"" will be released AGAIN along with ""II"" and ""III"". I was really exciting, but only the first movie will be released in ""4:3"" again??? I don't get it....... ""II"" and ""III"" are ""Wide Screen"", but why the first one is still ""4:3"" format????? I know a lot of people is waiting ""Wide Screen"" Edition of ""The Karate Kid"". Come on! It MUST be a ""Wide Screen""!!!!!!!!!"
5,The underdog who eventually will triumph,"Daniel LaRusso (Ralph Macchio) , has just moved with his mom from New Jersey to California, and has trouble fitting in. He is being mercilessly victimized by the local gang of Karate champs-the all blonde Germanic looking Cobra Kais, while he romances bubbly blond Ali Mills (Elizabeth Shue) who happens to be the ex-girlfriend of cobra lead-boy Johnny Lawrence (William Zabka).He is rescued from the Cobras by the caretaker of his block of flats, Mr. Miyagi (Pat Morita) who just happens to be a karate expert. After Mr. Miyagi enters Danny in the local Karate championship where he will be pitted against Johnny and the Cobras who are trained to be ruthless by their psycopathic trainer John Creese (Martin Kove), it is all about Danny's training to win the tournament, and to win the girl-Ali.Beautifully done , I loved the 80's atmosphere and the 80's music. I first saw it when I was 12 , and watching it again recently brought all the memories flooding back!"
4,a good movie,This is a good movie you can watch with the whole family. It's one of those feel-good movies.
3,Not bad. Stupid story line.,"I liked this movie a lot. But they could have picked a better story line for it. If they want to put fighting in it, fine. If they want to put romance in it, fine. But I don't think that a kid learning karate so he can fight his girlfriends x-boyfriend over HER is a very good story line. In the end it was not so much over her. But I think they should of changed the story line a bit."
3,What Dubyac99 Said,"Looking for a family movie to add to the DVD collection, I recalled The Karate Kid. The young boy, the mentor, wax-on/wax-off and some Karate for excitement. Turns out our memory of this movie is 30 minutes of Pat Morita scenes.Everything the above reviewer ""Dubyac99 MC White"" said is correct.Dated and disappointing. Also, the video is grainy and the sound is just okay."
3,This one is worth watching!,"This is a Decent film that I enjoy very much.Too bad for the sequels, they could have done so much more for this movie.You can avoid the Sequels, but see this film."
2,What's the point?,"First major disappointment (my fault, I bought it as a gift for my husband, and should have read more carefully) is that it is panned and scanned. Second major disappointment is that there are NO special features at all (I know, we're getting spoiled). Audio selection is also limited. I might has well have purchased the video."
4,Good movie,"This movie has a very easy plot, but you can watch once and again, because it's not like one of those stupid martial arts movies. Ralph Maccio gas a good perform in the movie, the same for Pat Morita, who had the nomination for this movie. And the feature of Elisabeth Shue, she looks very pretty. Buy it and you'll have a good time."
2,Poor Dvd Quality,Great movie. However the dvd transfer is poorly done. Only has dolby surround. And only available in fullscreen. I hope Columbia Pictures releases a dts widescreen version of this great movie.
5,I like it when they beat him up,"This is a great movie from the 80's. The rest of the series is not that great, but that doesn't distract from the quality of the original. This is a great film for kids who are interested in seeing what Karate should mean to them and when it's important to stand up for yourself, more importantly how. The rest of the series is truly horrible. Ralph Machio gets on your nerves after a more than an hour of viewing. To be honest, I only like the rest (especially part 3) when they beat him up."
5,True Karate movie,"It's been more than 10 years since I saw this movie for the first time, and yet, from time to time I still see it like as if it was that first day. The story is very good. A young boy stranger in the neigbourwood has some troubles when dating the former girlfriend of a gang leader. Young Daniel asks help from a Okinawa Karate master, and soon learns that Karate is more than a method of fighting, it's a way of life. Anyone who knows a little about the martial arts subject can tell you this film is one of the few out there who truly tries to follow the true spirit of Karate - knowing yourself. A great film, the best in the series, and one of the best of the kind."
3,didn't buy this afterall,"I was looking at picking up some of Wagner's materials, and initially thought he had a pretty solid background. Unfortunately, the more I dug the more weird stuff popped up...his military background, the circumstances in which he left both local and federal agencies. there are a few sites out there that discuss this, for those that are interested.this might be an interesting book in an interesting series, but I didn't feel comfortable giving this guy my money."
3,"Not Great Art, but definitely Great [Stuff]!","It's a theatre of the absurb, tongue-in-cheek genre conflageration combining the hard-boiled detective yarn, faustian tale, gangster epic, superhero noir and mad scientist flick.You know it's great [stuff] when this many analytic terms can be used to describe a B-movie that actually works."
5,"One of the best comic book films, ever.","Spider-Man. X2. Blade. These are all movies that are on the top of peoples comic book-film lists...but the fact is one of the best comic films ever is one not many have heard of. I am a huge fan of Mike Allred and never before have I seen an adaptation of a comic book that so perfectly hit the nail in the head as this one. If your a fan of comics, b-movies, or looking for something just a bit different, this is your choice."
5,One of the most beautiful songs ever recorded,I bought this cd for one song although the entire cd is fantastic. Buy this cd and listen to track 11- Show me how to love again. Althought this cd was released in 1997 this song should be in a regular rotation at all contemporary gospel and religious music stations of today. It is one of the most beautful songs I've ever heard and I think you will agree.
2,A weak contemporary gospel album...,"I was around 8 years old when I first heard this album. It's a really bad album technically, William Becton cannot sing, the contemporary gospel attempts are half hearted at best...but it's still nostalgic listening to this at 20 years old now. It's so bad it's good (or at least it brings back memories for me). Nobody's probably going to buy this album at this point for reasons other than the fact that they heard it way back when and want to hear it again just to remember how bad it was. I mean, he tried to do a Be Encouraged Remix! Epic fail! I'm not even going to review each song on this album, I'm sure you can hear the samples...judge for yourself and decide, but it's pretty weak..."
3,"decent, not great","There are some enjoyable tunes here, namely ""Nothing to say"" and ""I'm with you"". The rest range from good to blah. Look for it used but not worth the price new. If you take the good stuff from both albums and put it on one disc you would have a pretty great album, but this leaves a bit to be desired."
4,Platypus is far from distiction,"I hate Dream Theater, and I have never heard any King's X, but Platypus really kicks some butt. I deffinatly recomend this CD."
2,Buyers Beware,"This fridge was bought at toysrus. You CAN NOT, have this unit plugged in for more than 10 hours. The reason I know this now, is because we bought this fridge for our office to store milk for our coffee station, and it started to leak. So we took out the instructions, and it specifically says you can not run this fridge for more than 10 hours or you will cause damage and breakage. This was not specified on the decription online or outside the box, so who would know this. This could also break the units fan. Our first symtom is that it has been leaking water, not sure from what area of the fridge its leaking from yet. But we are considering returning this item, as it was not properly advertised."
5,A cute video!,"My 1 yr old son has been hooked on Bear since he was 6 mo old! It's cute, not annoying like other children's videos."
5,Real Friends,"These three ladies are what true friendship is made up of. Yes you have the one that is overweight,has relationships that sex is the major role. But baby can she dress. Then you have the one that thinks everyone is wrong but her and is very judgemental. lastly of course the friend that everyone can count own and is always trying to hold it all together. You will love there story and feel for each ladie and I am sure we all will find a little bit of our story within their tales"
4,Great Book,My book club Simply Divine Sisters really enjoyed the book. I t was our first book of the year. What a way to start the year with a good book.
4,Most women can relate to at less one character,"Nice book, it wasn't to harsh and it wasn't to soft. I enjoyed reading this book from being to end. The charcters seem so real and I'm sure most women can relate to one of them in some sort of way. That Charisse was crazy, I know it from the first time I read about her. Taylor, I really felt a little sorry for her because she seemed like she had things together. Then here goes her boyfriend with his double life. And Whitney, that was my girl even though she feel short of her goals she was sassy and at times she didn't bit her tongue. All in all, the three of them got everything they deserved.Read the book and see what I mean."
2,Too explicit,"I have not read the book completely because of the explicit sex scene in the first few chapeters. I am a Christian and I enjoy Christian fiction because its intersting and has a good message without all of the worldy, sinful content. This book just went a little too far. I am not a happy reader."
2,changing faces,i really liked the book i thought it could have been a bit more juicey but all in all it was good
2,Not her best work,"The first books I read by Kim Roby were the ""Casting the First Stone"" series. After reading those, I was looking for her to really bring it in this novel, but I must say I was dissapointed. Although the book did keep my interest enough for me to keep turning the pages, the real drama didn't start until chapter 32, and the book ended at chapter 36! If you're looking for a low-key, day in the life of girlfriends book, then this is for you. If you're looking for some straight up drama, then I wouldn't suggest this one.LSG77GURU Books club"
4,Surprisingly Good,I found this book at the library. I wasn't sure I would like it. I was instantly caught up in the characters. They are interesting and entertaining. I really enjoyed this. I could identify with some of the characters dilemas. Recommended read!
2,CHANGING FACES,KIMBERLA LAWSON ROBY NEVER SEEMS TO AMAZE ME. THIS BOOK WAS A GREAT READER. I HOPE TO SEE SOME NEW WORK AND HEAR MORE OF THE FRIENDS AND FAMILY IN THIS BOOK. THIS BOOK DEALS WITH A LOT OF HURTS AND ABUSE THAT PEOPLE DEAL WITH AND YOU MAY NEVER EVEN KNOW WHAT PEOPLE ARE DEALING WITH. LOOKS TRUELY CAN BE VERY DECIEVING. GREAT WORK MRS.LAWSON ROBY
3,Not a page turner,"Changing Faces was just OK. I've read all of Ms. Roby's books and Changing Faces was my least favorite. Changing Faces is about 3 girlfriends. One who is overweight and is surprise that someone could really love her for her full figure. The other girlfriend was not loved by her mother and therefore she found it hard to express love towards her daughter, husband and friends. The third girlfriend wanted desperately to marry her boyfriend who was very reluctant to take the plunge. Wooo! That's it! A very easy read. A few surprise but nothing shattering. As I was reading I didn't have a emotional connection to any one of the characters. This does not mean that I will not read Ms. Roby's future books. I look forward to her next books."
2,"Same stuff, different cover","Changing Faces is another one of those average stories about relationships that have flooded today's Black literature market. What's really sad is that these stories are starting to all read alike, have relatively the same plot, and the same feel good ending. Follow Whitney, Taylor, and Charisse as they muddle through life as an overweight sister in search of love, an upwardly mobile sister in pursuit of a husband, and an abusive wife/mother in the grips of instability.The story was predictable; nothing ground-breaking here. The writing style made this one very easy to read. I guess if you're looking for some lightweight fluff to get wrapped in, then this is for you.I'd actually give it 2.5 stars. It wasn't a bad book, just more of the same."
4,"THE ""B"" SIDE","This 1981 (not '82 as suggested) film adaptation of the D. H. Lawrence classic is an enjoyable B-ride if only for its panoramic scenery of foggy London and the sexually-charged engaging performances of its stars. Indeed, Sylvia Kristel (Emmanuelle) and the late Nicholas Clay (Excalibur) bring nothing but skin to their characters of an unlikely duo engaging in a torrid affair. Over an ultra-syrupy score (by Richard Harvey and Stanley Myers), and a fine use of camera work by Robert Fraisse, the two go at it with all their splendor, leaving nothing to the imagination except to wonder if the movie would have been better had a talented cast been involved. Since it isn't but remains enjoyable despite its flaws, this LADY CHATTERLEY'S LOVER is superficial enough to be camp classic material, which is, as we all know, an important factor for lovers of such films.-----Martin Boucher"
2,"""emmanuelle"" is better.","if you are a sylvia kristel fan then this movie will disappoint you. the sexual part of the movie is too tame compared with the original sylvia kristel movie ""emmanuelle"" which is more erotic than this ""lady chatterly's lover"". the love scenes here are ridiculous and unbelievably stupid."
1,not for me,sylivas tring to act more than show off that beautiful body so this flick was not for me but it might be for you actress types.
2,Disappointing Adaptation,"I think this adaptation of Lady Chatterley's Lover is lacking in so many ways. The actors are mediocre at best. Roles like Hilda miscast. Nothing against the actress in this role but she seems old enough to be Connie's mother rather than sister. And I rather wanted to tell the gamekeeper to keep his clothes on. Additionally, there doesn't seem to capture the passion and quiet desperation of the characters. If one wants to see a good film as well as a film that's faithful to the spirit of Lady Chatterley's Lover...This is not it."
3,disapointed.....................,the CD was scratched and it wasn't working and even though it arrived on time. I wasn't able to watched the whole movie I was PISSED OFF.
1,Lady Chatterley's Lover 1982 version,"what a dog of a movie,if someone is looking for a better movie version of this story buy the new (1992) or later americanized version"
2,Misleading!,"For the mostpart, this is not a collection of Grace Slick's solo works, it's yet another reissue of stuff that's already out there. Very little of it is from ""Manhole"", ""Dreams"", ""Welcome to the Wrecking Ball,"" and ""Software."" I'm very disappointed! Would somebody please issue these four albums on CD?"
3,So Much Missing,"I have to agree with the other reviewers. This is a rehash of mostly Jefferson Airplane/Starship material that has been available on cd for some time now (save for ""Better Lying Down""). The release of Grace's solo works is long overdue. She deserves a box set featuring demos, unreleased material and those four solo albums. 6 discs at least should suffice."
3,Hello? Record Execs? Grace? Anybody? We Want Manhole!,"As with any ""best of"" album, you can hear almost all of this stuff in the space of one week on a good classic rock radio station -- and it's not necessarily the ""best of"" -- more like ""the most popular of"". This is my last Starship/Airplane/Slick purchase until we get the best."
3,"Mnahole is still ""The best of Grace Slick""",Grace is / was /and always will be one of my all time favorite female rock vocalists. This album is fine - but in my opinion the Best of Grace Slick is her solo album Manhole. When will someone reissue it on CD so I can replace my scratched up vinyl copy??
3,Average Intro,"I'm just so happy to finally see this highly underrated artist get the 'best of"" treatment even if the selections leave so many deserving performances out of the line-up. There are some treasures that deserve released on cd??? both of my vinyls are scratched beyond recognition!), ""Silver Spoon"" from SUNFIGHTER, ""Two Heads"", Never Argue With A German..."" ""Eat Starch Mom"", ""Come Again Toucan"", ""Devil's Den"", ""Sea Of Love"","
4,Spacey Gracey Still Shines,"Gracey, Gracey Gracey...Great Goddess, I love this woman. There is no better acid rocker than Grace Slick. This record is phenomenal until track 16. ARGH! ""We Built This City?"" ""Nothing's Gonna Stop Us Now?"" What was she thinking including those mindless throwaways? Oh man...but that doesn't tarnish the golden shine of this record. Damn it Grace, it's high time you tour again! Which reminds me...I heard a rumour that she's touring with the new incarnation of Jefferson Starship. Can anyone confirm or deny that?"
3,Not as exciting as I expected.,"I notice that Grace Slick's first songs (""Somebody to Love"" and ""White Rabbit"") were absolutely brilliant! But, alas, the songs started going down hill after those two selections. ""Rejoice"" was also rather good as well. I adored the aforementioned songs, but am not nearly as excited with the rest of the selections."
2,When? Manhole wanted,"will it ever be, Manhole is the very best! Is anybody out there to create a NQ4, I lost my LP give news to me :-)"
5,Great book for post-beginner stage,"Kageyama packs the book full of useful instruction, given in a chatty style with the occasional self-deprecating humour. While not a book for the absolute beginner, he surprises many readers by starting with ladders. But he shows that they are excellent training for reading (calculating) ability which also builds self-confidence during a game.The book also covers strategic principles, typical endgame play (and a common mistake by handicap takers), josekis (corner openings).Of course, in such a game full of complex possibilities, books can't solve everything. For example, I presume it requires experience way beyond his book to know whether a move is ""proper"" or ""slack""."
2,Not a book for beginner. My son (9 year old) finds it hard to understand and boring.,"Here is my son's feedback - ""The author should have put in less self opinions, and just teach how to play"""
5,A must-have of first world war literature.,"One of the most surreal, dream/nightmare visions of war ever written. It crashes through the barrier between the subconscious, primal mind, and the awful reality."
5,Excellent!,"This movie is my all-time-favorite! Great actors, director, performances, and screenplay! Oh, and you should try to locate the ""motif"", and how the protagonist relates to the victim of the film."
5,Love this movie,I have this on DVD already but wanted the Collector's Edition. A quirky part of this is that the dvd case contained 5 dinner invitations from Hannibal... each with a recipe at the back of the card. LOL
4,One of the best Thrillers,"The movie does seem to have its flaws though, esp with the FBI missing every move, this was something that my Spouse thought was a flaw in the movie. Otherwise the movie is really good for its time."
1,ABSOLUTE BOTTOM OF THE BARREL,"A supposed ""thriller"" that gets laughs in all the wrong places, this seems destined to be relegated to ""Bad Movie Night"" festivals and 99-cent rental bins. Foster is adequate, but I can't help wondering what Lauren Tewes ('Julie' on THE LOVE BOAT) could have done with the role. As for Hopkins, his last great performance was in FREEJACK, and his work here is more than worthy of a Golden Turkey Award. And was the wall-to-wall ABBA music REALLY necessary?? For a real thriller, check out Brian DePalma's DRESSED TO KILL; 'SILENCE' doesn't even rate a ""guilty pleasure."""
5,Silence of the Lambs,Enjoyed movie very much. 2nd disk had info that inhanced the viewing of the movie.
4,Best film ever made!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Turly a masterpiece. Brilient and amazing. The one film you have to see for your self. Anthony Hopkons is an awsone Hannibal Lecter and Jodie Foster is a great Clairese Starling. The settings were beautiful. I am a big horror film person and so my dad said if you want to see scary movie see "" Silence of the Lambs"". And so I did and found it more sad then scary. Some parts were scary such as the part when the serial killer captures the victim and puts her in the well. I saw ""Hannibal"" and thought that was much more sad the "" Silence of the Lambs"". I cried so hard at the end. Back to the movie. Some parts I found quite boring. But otherwise its amazing. See it for yourself."
2,A herd of carnivorous lambs would be scarier.,"'The Silence of the Lambs' is one of the most overrated movies of the past 15 years. I don't know what in the world audiences and critics found terryfying or tense about this borefest, but I wasn't impressed the least. One of the first problems is the director, John Demme. This man couldn't direct a scene to save his life. Many scenes seem uneven and look like they only took one take. All the scenes look dark, dirty, and cloudy.The second problem is the acting. Jodie Foster gives a southern accent a good try, but lets not fool ourselves. Then there is everyone's favorite, Hannibal Lector. When he talks to Jodie, he stares at her with INTENSE EYES. I'm really scared now!! The third problem is the story. Hannibal's escape is really shocking...Really shocking in that it was so ridiculous, so implausable, I found myself gaping at the screen in disbelief."
2,Picture Quality is Lousy.,I love this movie very much. I bought the original Image DVD of this movie but was disappointed with its lack of features. The picture quality however is top notch and bright. What the hell happened to this transfer. I bought the Criterion collection thinking I would get a top notch feature filled DVD. The extras are nothing to sing about but the real crime is the picture quality. I'm glad I still kept my Image version. This is the first and last Criterion disc I will ever buy.
1,Will not play on older BD machine.,"I love this film and own several DVD editions. This Blu-ray version will not play on my older Panasonic DMP BD-10K, even with the latest firmware.This is a knock on Panasonic and on the Blu-Ray consortium for not sustaining compatability across generations of Blu-Ray discs and players.Shame on them!"
2,Unbearably intense? Please!,"If y'all want to see a great horror-drama then watch THE SHINING. In this film, Anthony Hopkins has master-thespian-trying-to-be-really-spooky written all over him. I'm sure he wouldn't have taken the role had it not shown promise of an academy award nomination. The only reason this movie won the best picture award is that it's ""safe"" enough for mainstream audiences. It doesn't contain anything very influential and astounding. At times it just feels like a TV movie for women, only with R-rated content."
3,A Decent Thriller,"It was a decent thriller that at times scared me. At other times in the movie I was almost falling asleep. I saw ""Hannibal"" before I saw ""Silence of the Lambs"", so I kind of did it in reverse. After seeing ""Hannibal"" I thought that the ""Silence of the Lambs"" would have been more about Hannibal Lecter, the main character of ""Hannibal"". The ""Silence of the Lambs"" was mainly about the FBI trying to catch a serial killer named Buffalo Bill. But it was still a decent movie with a couple of surprises. It is a good movie it's just not a non-stop-action-thriller. I would recommend it to anyone who likes scary stuff and rotten bodies."
3,Another edition of SOTL...,"I thought the Criterion release of SOTL was the definative DVD to get, but now the studio decides to issue this again with some new documentaries. So now i'll have to get this one too. I must have at least 2 dozen flix in my collection where i have 2, 3 or even 4 ""editions"" of a movie. My tolerence and my wallet is running out."
3,Excellent performances by Anthony & Jodie!,"I saw this movie one evening on TV, and, in my opinion, THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS has excellent performances by Anthony (Hopkins) and Jodie (Foster). I thought that Clarice (Jodie Foster) looked VERY pretty in all the dressy clothing she wore -- Especially the dressy outfits she wore when she visited Dr. Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) in jail. This film didn't scared me only a little. Well, maybe just a little. Dr. Lecter scared me a little when he attacked the two cops in his cell. There was only one thing that REALLY grossed me out, and that was the killer (Ted Levine) shoving an insect down each victim's throat and then skinning them. That was REALLY disgusting in my opinion. To wrap this up, I'd like to say, ""Parents, if you have young children, do NOT let them see THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS. They will have nightmares."""
3,Good but not great as people say,"I still feel this is one of the most overrated films of all time. It was a good film, no question about that but not a masterpiece like One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. I didn't think that Jodie Foster acted all that well in the movie but Anthony Hopkins was brilliant. The movie was predictable at times and its direction was shaky at the same time."
3,Great Film Suffers a Bad Transfer,"I'm sure it's quite easy to read around the other reviews for the praise the film deserves as a film. BUT unfortunately this blu-ray transfer looks washed out, with a constant sheen of brown that dampens the whole image throughout.It's a great film, but definitely deserves a better transfer than this. Buyer beware."
2,Pretentious as hell.,"I loves me some good, crazy intense movies, but this one is so tedious and in-your-face about being ""psycho"" it's insulting. ""Oooooh he's craaaazy"" Puh-lease. If you've watched any number of independent or offbeat films, *nothing* in this film will be anything but cliche."
5,"Not really for teens(Read loud mouth ,and narrow minded)","They are to into all those silly Scream movies to possibly appreciate this gem of a movie.Excellent cast,excellent directing.This isn't really for twenty-somethings either,this is more for thirtsomethings and above(read:mauture adults).The shinning(which neither won,or was nominated for ANY academy awards)in no way can compare.I thank God for this great movie,which beats the stuffing out of todays teen movie ""thrillers"",and then has it for dinner with some fava beans and a nice chianti.Fssst.Fssst.Fsst!I can't wait to see Hannibal!WONDERFUL MOVIE!Big box office hit!Better than seven too(and seven is pretty good)."
4,appeasing,"the transfer is ok. the special features (with the exception of the ""voices of death""- that was creepy) fell flat. as always, jodie foster + anthony hopkins transfer what could have been a horrible gross-out, rely on the gore horror movie into an exciting journey into fbi trainee starling's mind as seen through the ever so terrifying (but strangely appealing) eyes of dr. hannibal lecter. with the exception of the ""voices of death"" special feature, there's really no reason to get this in criterion. if you want to be terrified by the words of actual serial killers, buy this. if you don't, get the normal dvd."
5,The Silence Of the Lambs is Great!,"Silence of the Lambs was one of those movies that keeps you at the edge of your seat untill the very end! It was great!! ""I'd like to chat longer but I'm having an old friend for dinner.....Bye!"""
5,excelent movie,"I already owned it in digital but I wanted it in blu-ray format and I was not disappointed. If you are a hannibal series fan it's a good copy, the price was right too."
5,A definite classic!,This is certainly one of my favorite scary movies. It has great acting and a great story. Highly recommended for any horror movie fan.
5,"Great Movie, Great Extras",Love this movie and I'm not usually a fan of horror at all. Great acting all the way. I particularly enjoyed the added features on this special edition.
5,Great film,"Its been many years since I saw the film, its great to see it after all these years and remember the cool looks"
1,silly,The USA has no better security than a bird cage for a serial killer????? Rubbish. Fell asleep at this point.Waste of time. If you want a laugh watch dirty rotten scoundrels.
1,Not scary at all.,"This movie was so funny! I don't know why people got scared in it. It wasn't scary, it was funny!"
1,It Sucked,"This movie sucked. I bought it for five bucks used from the video store and it was a waste of money. People call it a horror movie, but it wasn't really a horror movie. There was nothing about it that was scary. It was more suspense than horror, but, to be overcome by suspense, you have to actually give a damn about what happens. You can't do that with these characters. I was uninterested thoughout the enitre movie. The only reason I kept watching it is because it's such a classic."
1,The scariest thing,"I stopped watching this movie after the ambulance scene. I had seen enough. The scariest thing about this cartoon of a movie? THAT IT EVER GOT MADE! Also scary is that the hollywood crowd gets lauded for this goreification, and that legions of people apparently enjoy this kind of stuff. Ooo blood, ooo peeled skin, ooo stinking rotted corpses. This film is great, if you're a maggot."
1,"Great Film, Bad Horror Movie!","This is a good drama, but Horror/Thriller/Suspense Film, it is not. Ask any horror buff, who isn't tied down to a particular genre and they'll tell you, that this film isn't scary. Some would argue that ""Oh but people like this really exist, this is real"", so, it's real, big real. Those kind of horror movies suck. Then some will argue ""Oh well, you just like a bunch of killing and gore."" Well in case you didn't know this, for all you ""reality"" horror buffs, gore is a very real thing. Ask any one who was in WWII or any off the other wars, and they'll tell you. That just proves that ""reality"" horror buff reviews aren't reliable, they are posers trying to sound intelligent, but to us real horror fans who don't care what kind of horror film it is, you sound stupid! This isn't scary, and that is the final word!!!"
1,Lambs' silence is interrupted only by audience's snores,"Anthony Hopkins is brilliant in his role as Dr. Hannibal ""the cannibal"" Lecter, the psychotic serial killer with a serious appetite. Unfortunately, the so-called thriller is one of the most overrated films of all time, scoring rave reviews and an Oscar to boot, and fails to live up to Hopkins' performance. Foster overacts like a good soap opera queen, and director Demme does not understand that pace is essential for a thriller. Although some shots are beautiful and grotesque at the same time (Lecter turns a bunch of police into angels by using their flesh as wings and such and hanging them), the plot is predictable, and worse yet-- slow-moving. Skip this one. Instead check out ""Halloween"", ""The Exorcist"", ""Psycho"", or ""The Shining"". Even ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" or ""Scream"" is more entertaining."
3,Gave me indigestion,"I had never seen 'The Silence of the Lambs', so when it came out on Blu-ray I thought I would give it a try. I did not find it to be a great movie. Indeed, I found much of it to be laughable. Now, perhaps this is because it has been parodied so much, I dunno. When the psycho killer said, ""It puts the lotion on its skin"", all I could think of was the parody scene from 'Joe Dirt'. Also, the part of the story about the vain, media-seeking doctor who 'treated' Lecter in the specially-constructed cell where he was kept was pretty far-fetched. Nor was Lecter's escape believable.All in all, a watchable movie, but one that, IMHO, is failing the test of time."
5,Haunting,"The Silence of the Lambs is the scariest movie I have ever seen (although I have NOT seen ""The Exorcist""). It is one of those stories that sucks you in from the very beginning. The imagery is very strong throughout the picture. The violence is intense, but definately not gratuitous. The final confrontation will shock you. This psychological thriller won the Oscar for Best Picture in 1991, and I can see why. Not to be missed! Bon Appetit!"
4,Great Movie + Great Extras = Fabulous DVD,"Everyone knows how great this movie is, so there is no need to rehash those details. What I would like to point out is the great extras on the DVD disk. The commentary is wonderful and so is the section that has the written words of serial killers. It is fascinating to read how these men think. The deleted scenes are okay, though they are of really bad quality. My only real gripe about this edition is that the image quality could have been a lot better. There is noticable dirt on the film that was used to transfer to the DVD. It doesn't distract too much though, and definately shouldn't keep you from purchasing this disk."
3,"Classic Movie, Disappointing Blu-Ray","Well after a two year delay ""The Silence of the Lambs"" has finally made it to blu ray. And what movie fan wouldn't be happy with this? This is one of the best movies to be released during the last twenty years. Unfortunately, it deserves a better BD than this.Simply put, the quality of this blu ray is only slightly better than the transfer seen on the Criterion DVD release. Also, the special features on the Criterion release are far more satisfying than what is presented here.""The Silence of the Lambs"" is a great movie in almost every way. The good news is that this is one of those titles that is not immune to massive double dipping. Hopefully in the not too distant future this will be re-released on blu ray with a much richer transfer.Peace"
5,It puts the lotion on its skin or else itgets the hose again,Silence of the lambs is by far one of the greatest movies. It had really good acting and a good story. It not really as scary as everyone says though. More on the disturbing side.
2,Avoid it,"I guess I must be watching a different one then everyone else. I;m glad it was only9.99. I think the colors are poor. In real black scenes, the black has reddots in it. The origonal looks better to me. SAve your 9.99"
3,"Marvellous Film, but not so marvellous Picture quality","All seems to be said about the Quality of the Film itself. It is absolutely one of the best Movies of all times! Just for the fine acting of the whole cast. Anthony Hopkins..äähh sorry, Sir Anthony Hopkins...;-)) is a superstar ever since...but there is a letdown to this DVD edition: Sorry to say, the Picturequality is somewhat of a mixed bag. All scenes with a hazier atmosphere, fog etc. show heavy artifacts, motionblurs and worse. Maybe this is due to the problems of the dvd-format itself, or else my dvd-player has problems of it's own, but the impact of the film is seriously diminished by these things. And this from a genuine Fan of Criterion and its gorgeous supplemental materials which are good on this dvd - but not outstanding! Sorry Criterion, but keep on the good work!"
5,Praise for the Lambs,"My second favorite movie of all times and the best movie made since Gone With the Wind. Silence of the Lambs is one of the three movies I have seen in my life that I give five stars to. An excellent movie in all aspecks! It desrved all the Oscars and then some of what it got. Though the sequel was horrible, this movie is still unharmed by it. I would recommend this movie to anyone, a great achievement that has been to me one of the greatest films ever made."
4,"VERY GOOD, BUT NOT THE BEST","While the DVD boosts some impressive special features, this edition is still not in the same league as the now unavailable Criterion Collection Edition. If you can't find that, then this is the next best thing.---Dan"
5,It never gets old,I've watched this at least a dozen times and it never gets old. A tight thriller that keeps you on the edge of your seat and has held up well over the years. A classic.
5,Very pleased,Everything looks good and runs smoothly. The disc and case are in great condition. Really no problems to report at all.
5,Hannibal Delectible,"An early version of the Hannibal Lector series which delves further into the mind of an intellectual serial killer. I bought this film to replace a VHS copy that was heavily used for an abnormal psychology class Instructor at my school. An early look at prominent actors like Foster and Hopkins which helped the film to win five awards; best actor, best picture, best actress, best director, best screenplay."
5,happy,"favorite movie, happy with product. could have gotten to my home a little faster, but no worries, i'm happy with it."
5,Chills your spine - with just the music and the word 'Clarice ....,"When was the last time you were scared in a movie ? You must have watched a horror movie, or something more explicitly scary.Silence of the movie is very different from it all, it is a psycho movie with great actors and great direction which will send chills down your spine with just a few words and some good background music.Sample thisHannibal Lecter: Tell me, Clarice - have the lambs stopped screaming?The words dont mean anything by itself, but in the voice of Hannibal Lector, it is a scary scene.One of the best Psycho movies that I have seen"
5,LOVED IT>>>>>>>>,"WOW.... I loved this movie! Dr. Hannibal the Cannibal Lecter was even more evil than in the book... and Jame Gumb was too... Jodie Foster was beautiful . I loved the relationship between the two characters jodie and Hopkins. This movie is exciting, dramatic, scary, and great. The end is great... ""I'm having an old friend for dinner."" Poor Dr. Chilton. The movie was really realistic... except for the end showdown... but it didn't make the movie any less wonderful."
4,Well made movie true to the book,"Only one reason this is not 5 stars - Anthony Hopkins. No, I didn't think he was terrible, or that he badly overacted, he just misinterpreted the part. I have read Red Dragon and Silence of the Lambs, as well as seen both Manhunter and this movie. Brian Cox gave a much more faithful depiction of the character Thomas Harris created."
1,False advertisement!!!! Fake widescreen!!!!,"This movie is one of my favorite movies of all time. I love the acting, storyline and pretty much everything about it. I just discovered that this dvd isn't actually widescreen. Yes it may appear that way but if yu compare it with the fullscreen version you will see that the so called widescreen version is fake. The tops and bottoms of the picture have been clipped and the picture zoomed in. If you already own this particular edition please compare it. I beg of you. If you don't own this dvd version then by all means buy the Special Edition Fullscreen edition. You are missing so much more on this dvd."
3,"OK, but not nearly as good as the book","I'm lukewarm about this movie. For all the critical acclaim, its at best a pale reflection of the book - which happens to be one of the best I've ever read. It was too tough an act to follow, and the movie ended up being decidedly inferior to the images I retained in my mind after reading the book."
3,Whoops!,"Be careful if you buy this from a store other than amazon.They snuck it by me at Wal-Mart - I saw ""Special Edition"" on the cover and figured it HAD to be widescreen. I was wrong. There's a little logo on the back that says ""FullScreen"" that I missed. I was distracted by the huge ""Special Edition"" on the front. Luckily, amazon makes it easier to find out which screen format it's in.I give the movie itself 3 stars, mainly because the movie loses a lot of its intensity, mystery, etc. in its 2nd or 3rd viewing."

1,BE AWARE !,This is a movie I was looking forward to on BD. Unfortunately my Panasonic BD player does not play the disc. There seems to be a compatibility problem with Blu Ray discs and older BD machines. I won't be buying Blu Ray anymore as I have no certainty it will play on my player that I bought for 1000 EUR (!!) 2 years ago. Way to go Panasonic and BD Association ! Get your standards set before you launch a product !
2,A waste of time,"I won this DVD in a contest at work, so I received it free, but I still got ripped off. This is gruesome, boring, unrealistic trash. And that's being charitable."
1,Weak and bland,"Let me count the faults of this movie: - Overacting - especially by the laughable Hopkins, but also by Foster (and that ""accent"" of hers...!) - Underacting - on Glenn's side: he's as vivid as the Vice President. - No originality - sticking to the novel even when it's unnecessary, without any creativity on Demme's side. - All new points are ridiculous: the silly ending, the cheesy lines (""fava beans""), and Hopkins' ludicrous ""jumps"" (his hiss, especially). - No style - especially when compared to the talent of Michael Mann who managed to turn Red Dragon into the wonderfully atmospheric Manhunter.Anyone who prefers this mess over the superb ""Manhunter"" is simply an average viewer, of our time - possibly not too bright and not experienced in the genre... as the comments show. O tempora, o mores!"
1,AVERAGE B MOVIE,I have just watched this -about 9 years after the rest of the world.I wish I had not wasted 2 hours.It is so poor that it could only frighten a child.It 's plot is so overdone that you get never get involved in it.Its got all the excesses of a gory comic strip.Anyone who never worked out after 2 seconds that Hannibal was in the ambulance is easily duped. Its a piece of trash for people who like trash but dont expect to be impressed.
5,Hannibal Lecter the best bad guy in a movie,"The first one of the trilogy of Hannibal Lecter. Anthony Hopkins at his very best. A fantastic movie, don't miss any of the three."
5,Brilliant,"This movie needs no review. It is absolutely brilliant. I wish I could watch it again for the first time.If you have the Criterion Collection of Silence Of The Lambs then there is really no need to buy this. However, if you have the original release of Silence, which has scene selection or play movie, then do yourself a favout and pick up this version. The original release was rubbish and the sound and picture on this new Special Edition are absolutely stunning. Great job."
5,WOW!,"This film is the film that has received the best five of the Academy Awards since One Flew Over the Cukooo's Nest. Best picture, director, actor, actress, and the screenplay. And the most special thing about this psycho-thriller is that this is the first horror film to be named best picture of the year. It's the modern psycho-thriller film. Just as people say The Unforgiven was the modern western film. This is a real well done flick. The idea of this film isn't that bad. I was willing to give this film 4.5 out of 5. But there weren't any .5 marks."
3,"Great Movie, poor transfer to DVD",A stunning film that is let down by the mediocre picture quality. I am guessing that this was one of the earlier DVD to be pressed as the picture has an abundance of artefacts whenever there are fast moving scenes. Extras and sound are good. Get the VHS instead.
3,"Dreams, fantasies!","This movie brought a lot of popularity to its Director, Ram Gopal Verma. It also was a watershed for Music Director, A. R. Rehman, whose original scores were extraordinarily wonderful. Of course, Rehman gained fame internationally too.The story is about dreams of young people, and those who were young once upon a time. A petite ordinary girl (Urmila Matondkar) dreams of making it big in Bollywood. Jackie Shroff has done justice to his role. Aamir Khan comes up with a stellar performance. This was probably Urmila Matondkar's best performance. It led to many other acting assignments for her. Gulshan Grover has put in a fine little performance too.The story becomes engaging due to the beautiful songs which have come along at just the right intervals in the narration.This is basically a love story where the protagonist takes a quantum leap to get his girl.The music and songs and Aamir Khan make this movie a must see."
4,a deeper appreciation of some popular movies,"Hopkins argues engagingly in this concise analysis of Gothic films. It is a scholarly discourse. So there are the not unexpected references to sundry Shakespeare plots, and various upscale BBC movies like ""Jane Eyre"" and ""Pride and Prejudice"". But she also surveys more popular fare. Like Mel Gibson's Mad Max series or the Lord of the Rings movies.She finds what we might term Gothic influences in quite a span of films, and not just the obvious incarnations of Shelley's Frankenstein.The logic does seem to be quite understandable to a non-literary reader. A chance for a deeper appreciation of some mainstream movies."
5,Great planning guide,"Rick Steve's style is engaging, making it fun to plan a trip and feel like a friend is giving you insider information. Great on travel tips but a bit brief on reference information - although visiting Steve's website before the trip helps a lot. Best used along with a deep reference guide like Fodor's."
1,Steves' Spain- not the color one!,"I was disappointed with this order. I had previously borrowed this book from a friend and loved it. It was most helpful while in Spain. However, I was surprised [and felt fooled] that THIS version has almost none of the glossy color photos that another seemingly same edition had. Misleading description."
1,I made a big mistake buying this book.,"I bought this book because of its high Amazon rating. What a mistake!I planned on visiting Barcelona, Valencia (Spain's third largest city), and Cadiz (the oldest city in Europe and place from which Columbus sailed). The book doesn't even mention Cadiz or Valencia!!Go buy the Michelin Green Guide for Spain - far better - and covers Cadiz and Valencia in great detail - as well as the rest of Spain. A far better value."
4,one of orwells best,"Orwell rapidly became one of my favorite writers after I finished Animal Farm and 1984. I thought these books were great and so I set out to find more of his books. This is the book I stumbled upon and found is just as fascinating as the other two. This book outlines the plight of poverty in urban settings; from the long ours as a plongeure in Paris, to the rowdiness of late night pubs in London. Through out the novel he describes the terrible inconvenience and burdon having no money places upon a poor person. He also tells of great adventures he shares with his friends in trying to acquire money and fun. I highly recommend this book to any reader but especially to Orwell fans."
3,extremely absorbing,"The best part of this book is the first half- the down-n-out in Paris half. Orwell creates an amazing window into Paris of this time. The immigrant neighborhoods, the jobs, the swindlers, all excellent material. The last half, homeless in England, is far less optimistic in tone, but is powerful reading. You may not agree with his conclusions, but the descriptions of these experiences are clear and perceptive"
3,Not as good as I would have hoped,"First of all, I love Orwell, but by the time I finished this book I have to say that I felt let down. Paris was wonderful and exciting, but London I found to be boring and depressing. Both were educational and in that regard, a very interesting read, but I just found Paris to be much more entertaining at the same time. Overall, I'd say you're not missing much if you don't read this one."
3,A little beat up,"The book cover is not the same. It was a pretty beat up book, but still readable. If you're looking for light reading, I wouldn't pick this book."
3,a review from an austrian student,"I had to read five books for our English lessions. One of these books was George Orwell's ""Down and out in Paris and London"". I already read his book ""1984"" and saw the play of ""Animal Farm"". I really liked ""1984"" and ""Animal Farm"". ""Down and out in Paris and London"" couldn't reach the expectations I had after knowing the plot of the two other books. But the story was okay and the book was easy to read. The book became more interesting when I heard that Orwell shall have written about himself in it."
3,A Heart-filled Drama,"George Orwell's Down and Out in Paris and London is a very down to earth novel. It's about a man who describes his struggles with poverty and injustice. His life makes us think about how lucky we are to have homes and food, etc. His feelings are so open and depressing. He will put up with anything and anybody just to get some money for some food and a bed to sleep in. This novel is brilliantly written through the eyes of a poor man. It makes you think differently about yourself. It's an excellent book that is written with so much simple force."
5,This book is the perfect gift...,"a. For those who blame the poor for being where they are.b. For those who think that an expensive restaurant is, ipso facto, a good restaurant.c. For anyone who would applaud a bracing, grimly realistic -- but not maudlin -- face-off with the real world of the down and out.The true shock is, seventy-two years after the publication of this book, we haven't even tried to solve the problem of poverty. Orwell's idea of having ""tramps"" work at farms in exchange for nutritious food is still a great one."
2,Playing at being poor,"Having read this book as a teenager, I always felt that this was an insult to people truly trapped in poverty. Orwell ""allowed"" himself to be poor, but the people around him didn't have such a choice. My grandparents struggled with want, and worked hard to give their children a better life. They would have been appalled at someone who could do better, but chose to be trapped in the underclass, even if it wasn't permanent."
4,uplifting,"This quite uplifting for Orwell. The book is series of tales of a time he was a dishwasher in Paris restaurants and a tramp in London.I am presuming he endured this as some sort of social experiment rather than of necessity, which appears proven as he always has someone to give him the cash to survive or travel.We are introduced to the filth and appalling conditions endured by many, some through choice, some through life just being harsh.How the book was uplifting for me was that many having no other choice just got on with it and did quite amazing things to survive. What was really apparent is that just because there was poverty there was no automatic drift into crime - which seems to contradict much of what today's social engineers would have us believe.A interesting read from the early 20th century. (1933)"
2,Heavily edited edition,"Be advised that the Harcourt edition appears to be the original edited version. As such the passages on slang end up containing a lot of ""-----"" which is interesting from the perspective of censorship in the 1930s, but is clearly contrary to the authors intent. Before purchasing a copy check the third or fourth page of chapter 32 for the following passage:""The current London adjective, now tacked on to every noun is ..."""
3,"Great book, but Kindle edition full of errors","LOVE this book, but the Kindle edition is full of scanning errors. Many French words are simply wrong. Be warned. A friend bought this for me, but frankly any ebook for sale should be copyedited and proofread. It's a crime. I still have to buy the paperback if I ever want to know the real words Orwell actually used."
2,"Great book, but bad copy.","I loved the book - it's quite gripping for a book in which not a great deal happens. It's no wonder that Orwell is considered one of the great writers of the 20th century.However, this specific Kindle version of the book was terrible. There are spelling mistakes the whole way through it. Capital letters are used for words instead of italics. There are full stops missing. I don't know how this version was created, or who actually has the right to sell it, but I was very disappointed and surprised.I recommend you buy the Penguin copy, which although is more expensive, will not have the spelling mistakes and other problems that this version sees."
3,Good value but requires care in use.,"This stabilizer is lower in cost and lighter weight than others on the US market. I'm using it on a utility trailer to ease loading. It works well in combination with wheel chocks. I can't recommend using the stabilizer by itself on trailers, as slopes or high wind combined with wheel movement could twist the frame. The screw and nut need to be greased during install. I used white lithium from spray can and that works well. It's easy to crank up and down with the supplied tool. The problem is there are no stops to prevent going too far when lowering. There was no damage from over-extending the legs, but you must apply some pressure on the front of a leg while cranking to get threads engaged and raise it. This stabilizer will work well on small RVs with parking brakes set. The directions are clear but should emphasize the need to prevent rolling."
5,WOW!,"What is Stanley Kubrick's best film is one of the funniest dark comedies ever made. Peter Sellers as Dr. Strangelove,one of three roles,is hilarious and the rest of the film is just great."
4,Interesting fact on Slim Pickens,"Something to remember when watching this film - Stan Kubrick didn't originally see Dr Strangelove as a comedy, instead intending a powerful portrait of nuclear holocaust. This was all until Sellers came on board and lost control. However, nobody told Slim Pickens (the bronco bomber) this, so he is allegedly playing the film straight. This, of course, makes his performance sixteen times better."
3,Dr. Strangelove Review for Mr. Black,"Dr. Strangelove was a pretty good movie I thought. It was what I had expected from an old black and white comedy. An average 15 year old wouldn't get most of the jokes. I understood some jokes that some others may not get but that doesn't mean they were all funny to me. There were funny parts, there were dull slow parts. A lot of jokes had to be explained which for the most part killed the humor. I watched this in English class so as far as school movies go this was one of the best. You need a certain kind of satirical humor which I think I understand pretty well for some one my age. So I would say not great, not bad, pretty good."
5,Excellent,"Movie was good never had any problems with streaming, older movie it was a little difficult to follow if you were fully focused on the movie. Had moments of funny humor. Small quips that only adults would understand."
4,"Dr, Stangelove","I am a fan of Stanley Kubeck. 2001: A Space Odyssey is arguably his best work. Peter Sellers and George C, Scott are magnificent!"
5,Surprisingly enjoyable,"I was in my early 20's when I caught this old black & white film one lazy Saturday afternoon. Being a child raised on John Hughes films (Weird Science, Sixteen Candles) I was sure this film would bore me to death. However, I was quickly caught up in its dark, obscure humor and stunned to see George C. Scott in a highly animated comic role. He is hilarious! I am also amazed at Stanely Kubrick's ability to keep the tone of this film so deadly serious, but manage to make every scene incredibly funny. I will never again be able to think of Slim Pickins without seeing him riding that 20 megaton bomb to his death, whooping and hollering like a cowboy. Makes me laugh just thinking about it! Definitely not a film for everybody, but if you enjoy dark cold-war comedy you should get a kick out of this."
5,Classic Movie,This collection is truly a classic movie from Kubrick. Of interest will be the special disc that has been added.
5,AN ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT MOVIE,"Perhaps the most subtly funny dialogue I can think of in a movie ever. It attacks serious subject matter with absurdity in a style that never makes it seem hokey, and a the same time, never takes itself seriously. Stanley Kubrick's screenplay is genius and Peter Sellers is amazing!"
5,Dr. Strangelove,"A Kubrick MASTERPIECE!! Doesn't get much better than this! If you like Peter Sellers or Stanley Kubrick, YOU'LL LOVE THIS!"
3,Strange to Love,"A great Stanley Kubrick movie which balances comedy (laughing in the face of death) and nail-biting thriller.All of the actors do an excellent job and brilliantly play their parts straight (you gotta love the scenes with George C. Scott freaking out -- especially his scene with ""THE GIANT BOARD!"").Kubrick did an excellent job of taking the fear of nuclear disaster and mocking it. This is one of his best and most fully realized films, and one can't help but await the day that a special edition DVD with deleted scenes is released."
1,Movie Arrival - Dr Strange Love,"The DVD hasn't arrived yet to review either. I can not believe this site. I wanted to note that this DVD had arrived at my home In Saint Louis, Missouri. Yet it requires more input on the DVD"
5,A great dark comedy,"It has both the elements of a good drama/thriller and of good humor.The movie is an excellent sample of poking fun at the philosophy of MAD, uses stereotypes in a comedic fashion but, still is political thriller that really makes you anxious to know what will happen in the end.If you're looking for slapstick comedy or the in your face kind such as ""Airplane!"" (which is an amazing movie in its own right), you should keep looking as this isn't for you.If you enjoy political thrillers and the film noir type, then this movie will give you a tongue in cheek version."
3,Maybe it's just me...,"I've constantly heard good things about Dr. Strangelove, so I decided to see it a few nights ago. I've seen it through 3 times now, and I still don't understand what's so great about this movie. I was born in 1980, so maybe that has something to do with it, but this movie was not funny to me at all. While viewing the film, I saw clearly all of the parts where a person is supposed to laugh, but I personally found the humor unappealing and bland. The only part I liked was when the guy with the cowboy hat rides the dropping bomb."
5,This is a good movie,"This is the best comedy ever! And what scares me, is that it is probably very realistic. Fiction can never outdo reality!!! Thats the genius of this film. If you like sick sick sick comedy, you`ll just love this movie.Just notice this.. The plot is serious and it is possible to believe it. Its the stupidity of the carachters and the entire world-political system that makes me smile.Imagine this. Both the presidents in the movie can destroy the whole world. But they only have a bad phone line to communicate with to each other.. Hehe...And of course, we have the ""ragnarok"" expert Dr. Strangelove. An imported German scientist, that of course is raving mad, and has the right solutions for the situation that occures at the end of the movie.I challenge you all: Is there any better way to deal with a worldwide nuclear catastrophy then the solutions Dr. Strangelove got????But remember, if you`re wong, you got to answer to the coca-cola company!!!"
2,Appalling conversion of a classic,"Columbia Tristar should be ashamed of themselves. They have managed to tarnish a classic movie by giving the most lacklustre, threadbare, and just plain lousy DVD conversions I have yet to see.I therefore do not concure with other reviewers who have given this DVD 5 stars and here are my reasons why:1. The box says ""deluxe widescreen edition"" when in fact it is 4:3 most of the time.2. Image quality starts off quite well but plummets about 30 minutes into the movie, most noticeably in the scenes between Mandrake and Ripper. The image becomes so badly pixelated that it becomes almost unwatchable.3. Zero special features. That's right _nothing_, unless you count a chapter list as a feature.4. A promotional advert is tacked onto the front of the movie.5. No English or French subtitles - only Spanish!In short, the movie is great but the conversion is rotten."
4,What just happened?,"This movie makes no sense but you want to keep watching. While not quite like watching a trainwreck, the effect is somewhat the same. Randomness does work sometimes. As if following the axioms of Chaos theory, Stanely Kubrick has made a beautiful, entertaining and weird-funny and occasionally ha-ha funny movie. The progression of the movie can be episodic and choppy, but that adds to character of the movie. I highly recommend this movie when you just absolutely need a little nihilistic confusion in your life. It really is a classic."
3,"Funny in spots, boring in others","People, let's be reasonable. This film certainly has its funny moments, but to site it as ""the best film ever made"" or ""perfect"" is just silly. This film is neither. It's not even the funniest comedy ever made. Sure, I laughed at Peter Sellars' conversation with the Russian Premier. And yes, I laughed at General Ripper's ridiculous paranoia. But I found many of the scenes monotonous, especially those in the plane, which were both repetitive and not particularly funny. Dr. Strangelove was mildly amusing at best. I smiled watching him, but never erupted in laughter. Naturally, you're going to have plenty of dopey people that think this is the greatest movie ever just because some critic told them to think that. But if you haven't seen this before, don't believe the hype. Prepare to smile, maybe even chuckle, and that's about it."
3,Good for a chuckle,"Critics across America call this one of the funniest comedies of all time. It is funny, but I wouldn't say it's good for a belly laugh. Sure, there are some chuckles here and there, but this is purely tongue-in-cheek humor.Example: Keenan Wynn's character tells (one of) Peter Sellers character(s) that he'll have to answer to the Coca Cola Company for shooting the lock off the Coke machine's change collector in order to pay for the phone call that may stop the nuclear holocaust. ""That's private property!"" he says. That's the flavor of the humor here. It's all very tongue-in-cheek, social commentary, like what you might find in a Dave Barry article or by some nut on the newspaper editorial page.Peter Sellers is wonderful in three very different roles, and George C. Scott is a hoot. But, again, nothing hilarious here. It's good for a chuckle, though, and the DVD has plenty of features to keep the movie fans busy. This movie isn't for everyone. But then, what is?"
1,Wanted to buy this but they altered the original film cutting out what Kubrick wanted us to see,"I wanted to buy this on Blu-Ray, but I see they molested this version like they molested the DVD version. I guess I won't be buying it... Thanks a lot idiots!"
3,"It probably _is_ a great movie, if you're over 50...","I loved this when I first saw it, now I'm not so sure. A lot of reviewers have quoted the 'you can't fight in here, this is the war room' line: unfortunatley that's about as subtle and intelligent as the satire gets. Message: BLOWING UP THE WORLD IS A BAD THING. Well, that's profound (not). Is it funny though? Yep. Hence the three stars, depsite the adolescent 1960s politics. And for once the sterile and claustrophobic atmosphere that infects virtually all Kubrick's work fits the film."
4,CRAZY GENERAL,"I HAD NOT SEEN THIS MOVIE SINCE IT OPENED IN THE THEATERS. THE IMPRESSION YOU HAD WAS THAT DR STRANGELOVE (ala EDWARD TELLER) WAS THE PRIMARY CHARACTER AND RODE THE BOMB AT THE END. IN REALITY DR STRANGELOVE (A MAD WEAPONS SCIENTIST; THAT MAY BE REDUNDANT)WAS A MINOR CHARACTER. IN MY VIEW THE MAIN CHARACTER WAS THE GENERAL (ALA CURTIS LEMAY) PLAYED BY GEORGE SCOTT. HIS BLIND SPOUTING OF FUNDAMENTAL MILITARY THEORY, UNTOUCHED BY REALITY, IS MORE THAN WORTH THE PRICE OF ADMISSION."
5,THE BEST!,This is the best role of Peter Sellers and George C. Scott and also the best movie of Stanley Kubrick.
5,Satire at Its Finest,"I forgive Stanley Kubrick for ""Eyes Wide Shut"", for he gave us ""Dr Strangelove, or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb"". In my opinion, this is the greatest dark political comedy film of the 20th century."
5,Dr. Strangelove,Dr. Strangelove is a fantastic anti-nuclear missle movie. No wonder it was panned when it first came out.The second CD of Bonus materials is utterly entertaining and educational. Bill S.
5,Reminder to Reviewees,"Have people forgotten that the purpose of the widescreen format is to allow us to see the movie in its entirety (as opposed to pan and scan)? I've seen so many comments complaining about a film lacking the widescreen format, such as this film. The fact is it was filmed in a multi-aspect ratio which changes throughout the film. I'd assume that movie fanatics would rather see a film as the director intended rather than a particular format."
5,Wonderful Sarcasm,I've been told that this movie is good mixture between sarcasm and comedy. When I bought it and I got a chance to watch I really loved it. It is a movie that can stay in the collection just because you can watch it many times and it is interesting.
2,Too much skipping disc.,"I remeber it as a great film with wonderful characters representing a vareity of attitudes about war, peace, tolerance, and stupidity. Unfortunately, the physical disc was badly flawed."
5,Stanley Kubrick at his best,Everyone involved in this movie was absolutely perfect. The film itself is a dark war comedy. There's not much to say about it that hasn't already been said. It's amazing. Definitely recommended to anyone who likes Kubrick. Recommended to anyone at all. Great film.This DVD is great also. The best version you'll find for a while.
3,5 stars for the movie; 1 star for the DVD,"What can be said about this film that hasnt already been said before? From the opening titles (with the bizarre lettering and the images of airplanes coupling) to the inevitable ending, its a masterpiece.The real fault in this product is the DVD itself. The details above claim varying screen ratios at different points in the film; its all 4:3 size. The transfer is atrocious; you can see every speck of dust and pin hole present in the celluloid version. And I dont care if Kubrick authorized minimal screen menus or not - the generic Columbia/Tristar menu and total lack of extras makes this feel like a cookie cutter product.With all that said, though, its still one of the best movies ever and well worth your time to watch."
5,Great movie!,This movie is a classic! If you enjoy Cold War Era movies this is a must see! Without saying much not to give anything away that's in the movie. You should have a darker sense of humor in order to find this movie funny or at least grown up during the Cold War Era.
4,A case where the parts are greater than the whole,"This is a case where the parts are greater than the whole. Taken altogether, Dr. Strangelove is a good movie that doesn't quite seem to come together. The parts, though; the distinct segments that make up the movie; the masterful cinematography that captures the characters and sets in ways that beautifully heighten their essences; the sexual underpinnings of the most powerful character motivations; the all around great performances including Peter Sellers' triple roles and, most impressive of all, George C. Scott's Buck Turgidson which is so animated, so expressive, and so thoroughly committed that, while it hovers just shy of Sellers' delightfully cartoonish Dr. Strangelove, it remains completely believable. These are what make the film a must see for anyone who loves comedy or good filmmaking, or great acting."
5,It doesn't get any better than this!,"Comedy, like technology, just can't be un-invented - once it's known to exist, it exists. The best stuff spreads quickly, ad nauseum, and this assuredly is a classic comedy. In typical u.s.-style, we didn't just one-up the competition, we ten-upped them to the point where their comedy/technology was rendered quote/unquote laughable. So to speak. Peter Sellers was one of the best, and he certainly knew how to leverage comedy. :-) A comedy about the ugliest cold-war techs, heck, why not?"
3,"Good DVD, poor picture","Please don't get me wrong...Dr. Strangelove is an incredible satire that humorously illustrates how governments behave like children. Though this DVD is an improvement over VHS in regard to picture quality, it pales to several other black and white movie transfers...especially Sunset Boulevard, All About Eve and Citizen Kane. It reminds of a dusty print at a movie theatre.On an upper note, there are some interesting extras about Kubrick that are worth seeing.I might hold out for a restored copy...but if you gotta have it, you gotta have it."
1,Not funny,"My cousin Mary Jo has pretty good taste in movies.. she likes good stuff like Waterworld, Battlefield Earth, The Seed of Chucky, etc.. so when I asked her for movie recommendations she told me to check out Dr. Strangelove. I was shocked that she wanted me to see this, because both of us know that movies made before 1990 are horrible. I was hesitant to watch this because it's so old but I decided to give it a shot. What a mistake!! People who pass this off as a ""comedy"" are ridiculous, as this movie was VERY unfunny. It wasn't even in colour, the characters were boring and there was way too much dialogue.For a REAL black comedy watch ""Soul Plane"" or ""White Chicks""!"
1,over rated,"I did not like this movie, neither did my friend or girlfriend. I seem to remember some hype about it as an old classic comedy, but it was not funny like it was supposed to be. Maybe if they did a remake of this movie that actually had punch lines to the jokes it may not be half bad. Some people may like this movie or understand it on a different level than me, but I dont understand."
1,Waste of time and money,"ok, some minimal thrill but not worth spending the time watching it. The so called humor was ineffective. The scene with the cowboy riding the bomb down was a sad reminder of the cowboy diplomacy that's been running the country for 8 years."
1,Reference,"Slim Pickens riding the bomb is a reference that is part of the American culture. Other than knowing the origin of this reference, this movie is a waste of time."
2,Strangelove school project,Cost too much for such an old movie. This could have been a rental. We will be less likely to choose Amazon video in the future.
3,Dr. Strangelove,This early to mid era Cold War comedy was OK at best. I remember the film as a kid and recognize it as a classic with a good supporting cast. The plot is simple and pokes fun at Cold War paranoia of it's time and came out the same time as it's more serious counterpart Fail Safe. The plot is simple and predictable. The characters are amusing but not really funny. I enjoyed it for it's historical signifgance but that's about it.
5,"SIMPLY STATED, GENIUS","Being a huge fan of the ""Pink Panther"" series, it is not a colosus revalation that I engoyed this film immensely. Peter Sellers demonstrated his comic gift playing the former nazi and the basic protagenist in the film. George C. Scott gave a rib-tickling genaral of the United States weaponry department and could not fit the part any better. The black and white priming gives the film charecter and the story (for the time) was playfully original. Sadly enough the plot is now bare reality. Next time you have a chance please see this classic piece of under-rated ingeniality and you won't be dissappionted.WARNING: Will only seem humorous to the WELL EDUCATED"
5,Classic,"love this eccentric depiction of the cold war era. Peter Sellers is fantastic as several characters. and you get to see many actors who had not made a name for themselves yet in the business...very good movie, I'd recommend it."
4,Cheap packaging,"I did not have a problem with the order, or shipment and would probably do business with this company again. I was not pleased with the construction of the DVD case. It was very flimsy, and I immediately replaced it with a sturdier one."
5,simply ingenious,"After the travesty to film that is 2001, I was uneasy about Kubrick's other movies. However, I was willing to give this one a chance because it had the late, great Peter Sellers. Now I know that Kubrick actually made at least one good film! Sellers is amazing in three roles that could not be more different from each other. It is well deserved in its position as the greatest black comedy ever made, unlike some other Kubrick films I could mention cough...2001."

3,"Great Movie, but unnecessary release","Of course this is an all-time classic movie, but I am surprised to hear all the accolades about this DVD 40th anniversary edition. Most of the DVD extras are already available in various releases. The Robert McNamara interview is definitely only worth one viewing and he is not very credible to begin with.Sadly, this 40th Anniv. Edition has attempted to present an aspect ratio of 1.66:1, which was only achieved by cropping the top & bottom of the picture. Also, the transfer is decidedly darker than any version I have seen. This results in a loss of detail, especially in the B-52 interior shots.I would recommend buying the Special Edition DVD release alreadyavailable. The varying aspect ratios are true to the original theatrical release and it includes most of the extras on the 40th Anniv. release. Plus, you can get it for about half the price."
3,"Good Movie, misleading packaging","With no special features at all,why would someone buy this dvd? Sure it's a classic, but the VHS version would certainly suffice. Why I bought the DVD of this movie was the words "" Presented in Multi Aspect Ratio"". The packaging goes on to state that this movie was filmed in Multi Aspect Ratio & the proportions would change periodically throughout the film. I have watched this DVD a few times and I have yet to see the Multi Aspect Ratio on my television (A 35"" Sony XBR). Misleading packaging on this Columbia release is certainly a negative to an otherwise great movie. Someone should wake them up at Columbia. Some extra DVD features would also have been nice for the price of this product. An excellent movie presented in a so-so package."
4,weird,"I am sure this is not for everybody. Like most of Kurbrick's work, this is a head scratcher. It certainly makes you think, as in, what the heck was he thinking about? It is brillient and crazy. Sellers is off the charts good in multiple parts. What happened to George C. Scott? He was wonderful in so many things in the sixties. He is at his insane best here. Being a writer, i was impressed at how the director tells the story just by showing gauges in the cockpit of the airplane."
2,funny story but bad timing,"The first time that I saw this film, I thought it was the funniest.but now, in this current time frame, it was sad, knowing that a war wasgoing on and our men were being killed for no good reason."
2,I didn't get it.,"A film I just don't get. Possibly it was made in a time I don't understand as well (6 years before my birth) with its fear of mass destruction and communist plots. Today communism is not such a great fear and mass destruction isn't either but individual terrorism is. I did not find the scenes to be funny with the exception of the hotline scenes and Dr. Strangelove's overacting in his final scene. Some excellent acting by both Peter Sellers and George C. Scott which almost makes me want to keep this in my collection. The DVD video transfer is not very good making the film look a bit like a poorly shot documentary (intentional?). No extras, not even English subtitles, although it is subtitled in Spanish."
2,Isn't funny at all,"This movie is lame. There isn't one good laugh in it. It is tiresome. The only good thing about it is that it warns us against right wing lunatics who might start a nuclear war because they are crazy. Fine. It is politically correct. But that doesn't mean that the movie is any good, and it isn't. I have hated almost every Stanley Kubrick film I have ever seen. His work is terrible. The best of the sorry lot is Barry Lyndon, which is too long, too slow paced, has no characters who aren't annoying and despicable, but is worth three stars, which is more than I can say for the rest of his garbage."
3,NOT THAT FUNNY AT ALL,"Despite Peter Sellers in three roles this is all pretty laugh-free as a comedy. Great sets, good dialogue (interesting but not humourous at all). I never heard that Pickens thought he was in a drama all the time he was filming. Doubtul when he's filming the sequeance when he's on the bomb falling out of the plane he still thought he was in a drama."
2,Poor performer on too few sheets,"Yes it's punches 7 holes. Five or less pages at a time. Since we need the funtionality I won't return it, but I'm displeased with the effort it takes to punch, the effort it took to set up the seven spots (all the punches came from the factory/story all bunched up on one end), and mostly displeased with how you can only punch about five pages at a time."
2,foriegn made,"I wanted a 6 hole punch, thought adjustable would be great. Can't get the six hole to line up for my Day-Timer. Not a good thing."
3,Clunker,"I have owned one of these for several years and it gets the job done. But too big and an obvious retro-fit from a larger three hole punch.After awhile the punches began to jam and it finally stopped punching completely through the center holes.I ended up buying the Franklin Cover 7-hole punch and it is way better. I would recommend this one:Frnkln Cvy 4-Sheet Seven-Hole Punch For Classic Style Day Planner Pages, Metal"
4,Perry Farrell Lives!,"The Farrell Brothers shine in this semi-musical extravaganza dedicated to offbeat camp, clearly interrupted by Louise Fletcher as their domineering mother while they search for virgin blood. A very comfortable expense of time, especially if it's dark and cold outside and you have nothing better to do."
3,"So bad, it's classic!","This movie truly a guilty pleasure for me. To paraphrase a previous reviewer, it is trite, unoriginal and derivitive . . . and that's its charm. It really tries hard, and in the end good triumphs over evil and they all live happily ever after. It's fun to watch with friends and point out the technical goofs, the overly theatrical dialogue and the ridiculous premise (how'd that mountain get there?) If you try to take Krull seriously as an important science fiction / fantasy work, you'll be disappointed. On the other hand, if you watch it for what it is, you'll have a great time.Also - watch out for appearances by the not-yet-famous Liam Neeson and Robbie Coltrane!"
3,It was a great movie in my childhood but not as an adult.,"Growing up in the 80s, cheesy sci-fi and fantasy movies were in abundance. Some turned into classics; I can watch The Beastmaster to this day. Some don't... like this one. I summed my thoughts up here. Warning: uses profanity and some spoilers.[...]"
3,Krull,"Krull was made more for Muppet fans than adult Conan or Beastmaster(my favorite) fans. Although not bad, certainly not as good as those other I listed. One note though. Look at the Glaive weapon in Krull and then look at the Predator ""throwing star"". See anything familiar? If you like D&D or sorcery movies and you can get Krull for cheap, go ahead but I would'nt spend much more than what is on Amazon."
3,Krull,"It's fun to watch. However, some parts feel like they were rushed or done too quickly and the ending is a bit cheesy. Overall I did enjoy the movie."
3,not as cool when an adult,"I liked it a lot as a kid but now its just silly. There are a few rewarding parts that bring about laughter. Its still cool regarding the idea and the actual weapon that Krull gets to use but kind of boring at some points. One of the funniest things about this movie is in the Special Features documentary when the actors speak seriously about how hard they worked on the film such as sword fight training, concentration, stunts, and the technology used which was absolutely ridiculous. Overall I wouldnt even share it with your friends unless you knew someone who was just dying to watch it which I doubt would happen anyway. Put it on the shelf and watch it only one more time in your life. Dont get me wrong there are some funny laughs that come about but they are short lived because the movie drags on a little longer than what it needs to be."
4,A Classic Sci-Fi Film before there were Computers,"This is a simple film about a boy who meets a girl, and then a monster shows up and kidnaps the girl. Definately one of my all time favorites from when I was young. The special effects are cheesy, but the action and plot are good."
5,Must bring this movie to DVD,"Over the years I have seen many movies, but this movie will always be my all time favourite. I saw it at the movies back in 1984 when I was 13 and never has a film taken me on such a magical jouney of escapism that it did. Please bring this to DVD asap."
4,An old favorite that's still a lot of fun.,"""Krull"" is a movie that caught my fancy as a 15 year old kid and still has a fond place in my heart today. While not a movie to scrutinized too closely, the likeable characters, good special effects, photography, and a charmingly old fashioned approach to storytelling and dialog make up for it's (admittedly) numerous flaws. Noteworthy for an early career appearance of Liam Neeson as a criminal with a heart of gold."
3,It's OK,The title says it all. Not bad enough to be an Ed Woods type cult movie and not good enough to want to watch twice. An early appearance by Liam Neeson hoping this job won't kill a budding acting career.
3,A worthy attempt,"Krull throws everything it possibly can at you as a fantasy film, and hence it fails in many regards because it tries to be so much that it just can't hold up under the weight. Nevertheless, it's hard not to like Krull and you can't help but sit back and enjoy some very original moments, including, at times, an unusually sharp script. Best of all, though, is the beautiful music of James Horner, who would later go on to score films such as Star Trek II, Willow, Glory, Braveheart, and Apollo 13. The music is absolutely stunning and full of excitement."
1,So Boring,"Bad story, poorly executed. If you like making fun of old movies this is for you. For others sear clear. Liam Neeson is barely in this movie, so if you are purchasing it because he is in it DON'T."
3,read the book & saw the Movie at the theater.,"almost exactly as I remembered it at the theater..... actually looks a bit better than I remembered it but still not as good as I'd hoped, it's an inexpensive movie and rightfully so, worthy of a rainy Sunday viewing and not much more.while the film takes it's time the introduction is rushed, kinda empty as is the ending.... a film that could have used a directors cut adding 10 more minutes.p.s. this is another movie in a huge list of movies that could have benefited from just a few dollars thrown at fixing up the special effects."
3,A good B-Movie,"KRULL is a fun movie if you are an avid aficionado of the sci-fi adventure-action movies like ""Beastmaster"", ""Conan"", ""Star Wars"" ""Star Trek"" or ""Lords of the Rings"", KRULL is not a big budget movie but the script is somehow good in the line of movies like ""Legend"" or ""Willow"". The classic battle between good and evil, the prince out to save his princess. The actors aren't well known (but we have Liam Neeson on a small role in here before his now famous days) but that doesn't substracts from the history.This is a good title to share with the children, and it's your average matinee movie, if you don't mind picking up a not so famous movie this one is for you."
4,One of the best special effects movies of the 80's!,"With this movie being one of Liam Neeson's first debuts to the silver screen, It is one of my all time favorites! I have seen it many times and have yet to get bored with it. It is a movie about an adventure and has a good story line with some of the best special effects of its time. There was even a video game created about this movie! Take it from a true fan of the 80's, this one is a MUST SEE!"
4,"""Great Mix Of Sci-Fi & Fantasy!""",Ken Marshall and Lysette Anthony star in this 1983 fantasy.A prince journeys to rescue his beloved from an alien beast.I've always liked this film and this special edition has goodpicture and sound plus some neat extras. I recommend thisclassic that has a great mix of sci-fi and fantasy.
3,Hopeful but weak and not quite disappointing,"I saw the film when it first came out in theaters and been shown on TV. I'm a long time fan of fantasy and always see these kinds of films when they are released. I liked the locations, the firemares, the editing and most of the support characters. The leads are attractive people and look good as prince and princess but they had no chemistry. Script was disappointing. Music was fine. Now I'm not picking on the the actors. I think replacing the two leads or talking more time with the leads would of created a better result."
5,Krull,I love this movie and want to get it on DVD for several years. I finally have done this. It is one of my favorite movies of all times. It still looks good after all those years. I would recommend it to science fiction fans and just movie fans.
2,Soundtrack was the only redeeming quality,"I have to say that this was one of the biggest Sci-fi disappointments that I have seen recently. I don't mind a low budget movie, or a bit of cheese, but I could hardly endure sitting through this entire movie. Bad characters, acting, effects, plot, etc. The only redeeming factor about this movie was James Horner's soundtrack (the only reason that I gave this two stars instead of one), except he recycled much of it in or from ST2:Wrath of Kahn. My advice is, get the soundtrack, and don't waste two hours watching the film."
2,Feel like I'm being taken for granted,"Although, I have many purchases from this seller, and most times the conditions of the items have been acceptable, I feel that now I am being taken for granted. Belly, was scratched and in horrible condition when it arrived. The 13th Warrior won't play. The Omen movies were in less than acceptable shape but the movies did play. There was a another movie that didn't play at all. And the movies that did play well, were in widescreen. (I hate widescreen). So, I definately feel cheated, but its cool because I will just never spend another dollar at gohastings again. Thanks for nothing."
1,i'm the only person who dislikes this movie?,"Wow, i'm confused. When my friends and i make lists of the worst movies of all time, Krull is always at the top of the list. The sci-fi/fantasy group here in Minneapolis has a monthly movie night at a local theatre where we watch horrible movies and laugh at them. Krull's one of the favorites for being so bad it's funny.When i was a kid, i had low standards. Really low. i loved movies back then that, when i watch them now, i wonder what i was thinking. How could i have liked Gymkata? How did Beastmaster make it on my top 10 list? But even back then, i thought Krull was one of the worst films i had ever seen, second only to treasure of the four crowns. It's not simply poorly done for now - it was bad decades ago when i was just a kid"
4,Must-see,"Just as good now as I found it when I saw it at the theater as a child. I waited weeks for it to come out after seeing the first commercials and I was not disappointed in the slightest degree. If you are or ever were a child of the eighties, this sci-fi extravaganza won't let you down."
4,It has got everything a Fantasy should,"Krull is one of our favorite family films. It has everything a Fantasy should. An evil, alien monster keeps the beautiful young Queen prisoner, and her handsome, brave King must find her by the aid of a magical weapon, fighting many battles against incredible odds with the aid of an assortment of loyal companions: an inept magician, a Sorcerer's apprentice, a powerful but sad Cyclops, and an outlaw chieftan. Did I mention the flying horses? A wonderful way to spend a rainy afternoon."
3,"A long time ago, in a galax....oh wait.","This is one of those movies I had fond memories of as an 11 year old boy. As a 39 year old....eh.Saying this is from 1983 is probably the best way to describe it. Special effects only the 80's can provide. It's one of those sci-fi/fantasy films that just tried to stuff as much possible into it. It's got the rescue plot, bad guys from outer space? A magician, a giant spider, an old wise man, a cyclops, flying horses, and freaking laser beams! I can appreciate all that, and even the cheese factor. What bothered me most for some reason, is that the whole film revolves around this five-bladed throwing star that our protagonist never even uses until the last ten minutes of the movie, then is somehow able to control it like a jedi, something co-star Liam Neeson would portray 16 years later.Still, this was a fun watch, and a great bit of fantasy escapism."
4,Quit Comparing to Star Wars and Enjoy,"Look I know this isn't on the same level as Star Wars or Lord of the Rings, but it wasn't ever intended to be. It's an entertaining, somewhat cheesy, sci-fi adventure that is a bit too long but has good action scenes and cool characters. All you sci-fi snobs need to get off your pedastools and love this awesomely bad movie."
3,So-so quality,"We loved using the cosleeper for our newborn's first month of life. The sheets, however, are not of the same quality as the cosleeper product itself. They shrink (I did use the dryer--no time to air dry). They also ripped in the corner when trying to get them on the mattress pad (due the the shrinkage, most likely.) But, if you want to use the cosleeper and want extra sheets, I believe this is your only bet."
3,Fair Snack Mix,"I have been looking for a good rice cracker/wasabi snack mix for a while. I am currently in Afghanistan and have a problem finding companies that will ship food of any sort here and the local snack food selection is poor to say the least. This company was more than happy to ship and the product arrived well intact. The wasabi peas that this company (not the seller, 5 stars for them) use are very hot, a good thing for me, but also many are discolored and hard. Maybe over roasted. The rice crackers are just that and are quite bland, and there are a ton of almonds (with good flavor) and seeds. I am used to a more cracker and pea based mix. This mix has a decent flavor but not the one I was looking for. I will certainly eat and enjoy every bag that I ordered, but I am not sure that I will purchase again."
3,Too general,"Nice book, I bought it because it was geared for kids, but it was very very limited in the variety of animal tracks and scat shown. It would be great for city kids visiting the Rockies."
2,Is This What American Literature Has Come To?,"First off, I'm not on any publisher or bookseller's payroll. I'll keep my fingers crossed this gets posted.Secondly, I read ""Beacon Street Mourning"" after two books by P.D. James, a serious mystery writer. It is really beyond me how the apparent scriblings of a bright fifteen-year-old could sell for millions. Marketing in these United States is something to behold. Dianne Day, if such a person really exists, has no command of the English language. Her sense of history is limited to lists of street and building names. She draws her characters from a limited list of 1980-90s personalities. I'm sure that makes her readers feel at home, but history and good literature it is not. I give two stars because I was able to follow the plot and Day put in a good week-end of work.It makes me angry that such low-quality fare is offered the public. There are good writers out there. Publish them."
2,Deflated Fun,"I know: it's a balloon, so how long can we really expect them to last, right? I did expect them to last longer than one day. My 8yo received a dollar store version at a birthday party and it lasted all of 30 minutes. I bought a replacement at Old Navy and it was no better. We found these at Amazon and thought maybe they would have a longer run and they did, but not by much. For something that isn't intended to last more than a day anyway, might as well go to the dollar store..."
3,Deflates too quickly,".ove these, always remind me of when I was a child. Yes, I know I can untie and reinflate them, but as that is a pain, I give this item fewer stars"
1,Poorly made balloons,"I thought if I paid a lot more, I would get a better product. I was wrong. One popped right away. The other has a weak spot in the rubber right next to the blow hole. It will not blow up more than 6-7 inches without popping. I will never buy these again. I got the 50 pack on Amazon for a price some people consider unlucky. Elevators in America are missing this floor as well."
4,XWF,"The XWF is a Wrestling Federation in the Abberant game world. This book has information on it incase one of your characters ever wants to join up. Certainly not important for running the game, it does add flavor and something new for characters to try. Also good is the low price."
4,Jack Links Jalapeo Beef Jerky,"Jack Link's Beef Jerky, Jalapeno, 1.8-Ounce Packages (Pack of 8)Great flavor with just the right amount of jalapeno."
5,A family friendly snack,"Yesterday was the first time I have had jerky in years. It is better than I remember. Possibly it is this brand that is better than others that I have tried. Who knows?Here's what the label says. One 1 ounce serving contains 0.5 g fat, 0 g saturated fat, 0 g trans fat, 20 mg cholesterol, 590 mg sodium, 3 g carbohydrates, 0 g fiber, 3 g sugar, 15 g protein."
2,So So Beef Jerky,"Not very impressed with this product, Kinda tough..I have had better and have ha WORSE.."
1,Very disappointing...,"Upon a recent trip to China, I was briefly introduced to Mahjong. I very much enjoyed the intro and was anxious to introduce my game playing family to it. My hope for this ""American Version"" was clearly instructions and quality pieces.The instructions are pitiful with major translation issues, frequent misspellings, and woefully incomplete guide to learning the game.The review says it's for the beginner and advanced player. Well the beginner doesn't stand a chance as to figuring out what their supposed to do and the advanced player I suspect would be highly disappointed in the quality of the tiles.Do not buy this...look elsewhere!"
1,Terrible service,I still have not received my order. I am not happy. Hard to review a product when I haven't had it to use.
3,simmilar,"if you have ever played marble maddness then you will definatly know how to play this game, you start off as tyson and you have to time your launch rite to get a power launch, beating beyblades will allow your bitbeast to be stronger and then eventually you can use a special move. You never see tyson or any of the gang except when they talk before the battle with little animation characters which only move thier mouths, the object of the game is to go along the chekerd platform and get to the check point and you win, or in a boss battle knock that beyblade off or stop it from spinning, a tricky game to master, it is repetative through out the levels, it is not what i exsoected but i still enjoyed it, i hope this was helpfull for you."
2,beyplayer,"Good game. I got a lot of items, and I beat the whole game.Hard if aiming for ""Bonus rounds""."
1,Not even the biggest Beyblade fan should get this...,"First off, I'm a huge fan of Beyblade, but I have to say this is one of, if not THE worst game I have ever played. For one thing, this is suppposed to be Beyblade V-Force, and the characters all have their old Blades from the first season. The sound effects are awfull, the ""bit-beast attacks"" are plain and boring, and the graphics look like a mediocre Gameboy Color game. Most of all though, the gameplay isn't even fun, it's not even good for passing a couple of minutes. I feel Atari totally missed the whole concept of Beyblade, instead of it being a battling game, it's more like a boring version of Super Monkey Ball. If you want a real Beyblade game, try Beyblade GRevolution. It's pretty short, but it still has the same feel as the show, a lot of nice customization options too."
5,smith at his best,"i am the biggest fan of kevin smiths and i think this is a perfect combination of all genres. excellent love story with certain charachters that bring you back to mallrats and clerks, i am of course talking about banky, he is the classic kevin smith i highly reccomend this movie"
5,One of Kevin Smith's Best,"I loved this movie, and it was the one that made me first start to take notice of Kevin Smith's brilliant writing and directing skills. The acting is also superb, I love Ben Affleck and Joey Lauren Adams, and Jason Lee is brilliant. Also check them out in Mallrats, another great Smith movie. Anyway, the only thing I didn't like as much about this movie was that a lot of parts seemed to be more serious and emotional, as opposed to the pure hilariousness in other Smith movies, but I guess it's supposed to be a personal story and it fits. This is a great dvd with a lot of good extras (check out the commentary, Smith and Affleck are great), don't delay in picking it up."
3,criterion?,"i'll keep it short. very good but slightly overrated film. this transfer is pretty bad though. for criterion, it's terrible(and i'm not that picky). i've seen transfers of films three times as old as this this look much better. too bad. almost as disappointing as the highlander dvd..."
2,It's just a chick flick,"Eh. The parts with Jay and Silent Bob were ok, but this just isn't my favorite movie. People said Mallrats was a let-down after Clerks, but I say this is the let-down. And hey! Mallrats was good, but anything after Clerks would be a disappointment, with it being the greatest movie of all time and all. Well, maybe not, but it sure is funny! Buy Clerks instead."
2,I'm glad it was just a rental,"Some of my best friends are lesbians. Heh, it's a cliche, but it's true. So it's not the subject matter that turns me off; it's the clumsy execution.I must confess, I haven't seen the entire movie. I turned it off a minute or two into the pivotal scene in which he and she discuss sexual histories. It was just too lame to watch. I'm suprised that Ben Affleck (or Joey Lauren Adams, for that matter) hasn't bought up all the copies just to prevent that supreme moment of Bad Acting from being revealed. This is the opposite of ""selling"" a scene. To be fair, it wasn't just bad acting - they were delivering some of the most wooden lines I've heard from a supposedly hip writer/director. The entire script is gimmick-laden, permeated with an urge to explore these intricate relationships, but never getting beyond two-dimensional portrayals. Could have been very good, but it's just a bad joke."
2,"A good movie, if you don't mind crude language","I like how Chasing Amy borrows from other movies such as The Graduate and Jaws (the scene at the booth, at the Meow Mix). The main thing CA does for the audience, IMO, is to make us think about how we feel about gay/lesbian lifestyles, and if we can accept someone, knowing what they've done in the past.Of course, your standards and definition of 'crude language' may differ from mine. I thought it was excessive here. But then, maybe this movie is showing us a particular group. Actually, I think a large part of our society talks this way. It's reality."
2,Chick Flick,"I loved Dogma, Clerks and even dug Mallrats. Unfortunately, Chasing Amy didn't live up to my expectations. The rapid fire dialogue is similar to that in Smith's other films, but here most of the verbal exchanges fall flat - or go on far too long. The only decent scene was the one with Jay and Silent Bob in it."
4,Really like a 3.6 out of 4,"I can't wait for a bad Smith movie to come out so I can say, ""IT [...]!"" This, however, like all his movies so far was beyond good and almost revolves beyond the area of perfection that it's back to [...]! There, I said it. Really, if you like an intelligent, witty and pretty funny movie rent this. It could have done with Jay and Bob, but I guess it was alright for the small cameo it was."
4,good movie,my favorite kevin smith movie is clerks and chasing amy. very funny movie with ben affleck and joey lauren adams. i recomend this if you like the other kevin smith movies. worth the money.
5,i love her,anything that joey laurren adams is in is a [great] movie. dont miss this one. kevin smith is one of the best directors of our time and anything he does delivers a perfect view of teens and young-adults in this era. [great] flick!
4,"WHY NOT A CRITERION ""AMY""?","If the Criterion treatment can be given to a big, dumb, lumbering Hollywood road apple like ARMAGEDDON, then why not a creative, entertaining, sometimes excruciatingly funny, sometimes deeply poignant small budget treat like CHASING AMY. Joey Lauren Adams gives an ingratiating performance, and is matched by Ben Affleck and Jason Lee as the other corners of this highly unusual romantic triangle. Worthy."
1,Irresponsible Representation,"I've never been a fan of Kevin Smith's, but have always been amazed by his popularity. And why shouldn't he be so popular? His films are envisioned from a white, suburban, male, heterosexual perspective... and how true that is with this film! Sure, I'll buy the notion that ""love knows no boundaries"", but, in a Kevin Smith film? He has definitely carved himself out to be every white surburban heterosexual male's hero. And why wouldn't he be? He's made their wet dreams come true with this film. His portrayal of the lesbian community to an audience lacking real exposure to such a community is irresponsible and shameful."
1,"Kweel,indeed recomend to ani 1!","This film is totally kool,a great film to follow up mallrats not as good as mallrats mind, but still ace.Jason Lee just as good in this as mallrats and still nice lookin with the beard!I recomend this to ani one with a stupid sense of humour,and loves kevin smith films."
5,A great movie,This is a wonderful movie! It's not a chic flick and it's not a blood and juts action movie so it can appeal to many different people. If you liked this movie you should also see Clerks and Mallrats.
4,THIS MOVIE IS HILARIOUS!,"Damn this movie is funny. Clerks was wicked, mallrats...I dident mind. And now Chasing Amy is just funnier then both put together. That whole ""star wars is racist"" thing was funnier then anything I've seen this century. Excellent dialogue and some pretty good acting, Chasing Amy is a real funny film with heart."
5,What a great movie,"I have seen this movie a few times, and each time I am surprised by how much I like it. The actors do an incredible job portraying painfully raw emotions. The scene in the rain is, as far as I am concerned, the best part of the movie. I wholeheartedly agree with the other reviews who have said this movie is not about homosexuality. This movie is about love, and how love knows no limits."
5,Refreshingly complex and real.,"It is nice to walk into the mass-market video rental store sometimes and come across a movie which isn't pressed out of the same watered-down, plastic, 110% post-consumer, bleached and pressed material that most movies are made of. The slow start sent my wife off to bed but I was glad to have stuck with it. The by the end I was totally drawn in to the emotional state of Holden and pleased with the real-life, unhappy ending. As an old married guy I was caught off guard by the reminder of the utter torture of love and love lost. Especially love lost by the tragicaly flawed reasoning of the male mind. I really thought he'd understood Silent Bob's ""Amy"" story and would pull it together...but there lies the tragedy. Great Movie."
4,A movie for those who thought life was clear cut,"You know, when saw this movie with my best friend, I thought it was going to be about two guys chasing the same woman. I didn't realise that it was going to make me look at the way we define relationships, and the way we *don't*. Ben Affleck was intense and adoring ...and if ever there was a movie worth watching, enjoying, and then bugging your friends to see-this is it."
3,"Good, not great. Some mixed feelings.","Ok, here's my scope on this film: This was a very original and intersting storyline developed by a very talented writer, one Kevin Smith. I have tremendous respect for Mr. Smith, and loved all other three movies he has written, and starred in (to the uninformed, those are: Clerks, MallRats, Dogma). But...Chasing Amy left me thinking something akin to: ""That's it?"" The movie is hilarious, don't believe otherwise, however...it leaves something to be desired. I can't quite put my finger on it. Do not pass this one up though, go rent it, and see what you think. I know many people who consider this to be one of the greatest movies of all time, and maybe your one of them. Go for it."
5,An instant classic!,"Chasing amy Has to be one of the top ten films I have seen in my life to date, When I was a teenager I was an avid skateboarder and had the pleasure of riding with Jason Lee in his lesser years, so, to see him on screen is a special a thrill for me. Anywho, the reason I say this film is a instant classic is because its one of those rare movies that you can watch over and over and still get a kick out of. And I for one plan to show this film to my daughter whene she asks that dreaded question ""Dad, what's a lesbian?"""
3,Why Kevin Why?,"For the first half of this movie, it was a classic. I loved it and thought I would watch it again and again. Then the fight happens... and happens... and happens. I spent the last 45 minutes wishing I could go into the movie and slap some sense into Holden. I suppose if you've done something like this, you might think it's being realistic. If you haven't though, it'll just be ""Boy Meets Girl/Boy Becomes a Blithering Idiot and Throws His Life Away."""
2,"um, sorry folks; though I'm not gonna stop you","LOVED Clerks, REALLY LIKED Mallrats,thought this was just not up to the standard. Boring, hackneyed, homophobism-athon. Kevin Smith gets my respect, but not for this muck. The only character I didn't want to kick off a ledge was Jason Lee's sidekicky role as the inker.... sour, mean, and fundamentally committed.... any stars this gets is due to his acerbity, though Joey Lauren Adams is lovely (must confess I've never been able to stand Ben Affleck, loved the fact that he was a maroon in Mallrats, he was perfect as the evil, abusive, rebound grabber).Don't waste your time, see Clerks first if you haven't already, see Mallrats if you haven't, and wait on this one until it's the only tape in the videostore.Better than ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"", but ALSO more schmaltzy."
3,Disappointing compared to other Kevin Smith movies,"After seeing Jay & Silent Bob Strike Back, Clerks, Mallrats, and Dogma (all great), I had high hopes for this movie. Blah, was I wrong. I guess it is an ok (but twisted) romantic movie, but compared to the other Smith movies it comes off as pathetic. Half this movie was devoted to Holden's hangups over his girlfriend's past, that was what much of Clerks was about. Overall this movie is more emotional and not as clever and humourous as the others.It gets 3 stars for Jason Lee, Jay & Silent Bob, Star Wars references, and the references to other Kevin Smith movies.Better than Jersey Girl though."
2,Kevin Smith at his WORST!,"It starts off great ""BLACK RAGE! BLACK RAGE!"" and theappearance of Jason Lee comforts us, while Ben Affleck discomfortsus. However, after the usual shennanigins, CA is a very sub-par, BADmovie. All we see is Ben Affleck moping about stupid lesbian JoeyLauren Adams for a whole hour and a half. Jason Lee is funny though,and the very brilliant scene with Jay and Silent Bob is great. (onescene? come on!) And the finger cuffs scene is hilarious, it had merolling. But, the rest of the movie is boring and uninspired. Theending is so contrived and stupid I was hoping the DVD would burn upin my PS2 and maybe I'd get my $299 bucks back-that's how much Ideserve after watching this."
3,Something Missing,"I think this movie was average but where the #@%^ was Jay and Silent Bob. They are the best characters in any of Kevin smith's movies. Not that Jay and Silent Bob would really fit into this movie, but he found a way to fit them into Dogma, so find a way for Chasing Amy!!! Anyway the new movie Kevin smith is making doesnt feature Jay and Silent Bob! WTF is that? Dont buy this movie it is a huge @#&%ing waste of time."
3,Corny.,"Viewed: 4/09Rate: 64/09: Chasing Amy is a film that explores sexual relationships and invokes freshness in the conversations about them. The performances by the cast are good, but the reality is that everybody is corny as hell. There is too much profanity in the dialogues, and there is too much obviousness about the subject of any conversation. Chasing Amy was working well for me for a while until the last twenty minutes or so, and then it fell apart. The conclusion wasn't satisfying for me. Another thing that I hated about the movie is the prevalence of cigarette smoking. Some parts of the film were working for me, but in reality, I just didn't like the movie that much. All in all, Chasing Amy is a mix of fresh and corny."
1,Chasing Amy is great!,"Writer-director Kevin Smith (Clerks) makes a huge leap in the wrong direction with this weak story about a comic-book artist (Ben Affleck) who falls in love with a lesbian (Joey Lauren Adams) and actually gets his wish that she love him, too. Their relationship is attacked, however, by his business partner (Jason Lee), who pulls a very unsubtle Iago act to cast a sense of reality over the whole affair. The film has the same sense of insiderness as Clueless--this time, Smith takes us within the arcane, funny world of comic-book cultism--but the themes of jealousy, deceit, and the high price of growing up enough to truly care for someone, being completely absent, make this a very annoyingly psuedo-intellectual movie."
1,Trying not to be trite,"I was swayed by the reviews. Heterosexual chases lesbian is usually something I'd avoid. I should have trusted my tried and true instincts. There are certain themes that have been done and done again. The only way someone else can do them is to come from a totally new perspective. Because this has the ""aura"" of comic books, I imagine a number of people feel they see that new perspective. I don't. It's the same old same old. Different clothes, but nothing new. No insight. The photography isn't exceptional. The direction isn't exceptional. The acting is almost acting. I respect Criterion. If this hadn't been a Criterion release I probably wouldn't have purchased it. I'll still consider Criterion a cut above, but this really doesn't deserve the attention it has gotten. Well I guess it really did. Cause it didn't make a bunch of money."
3,perspective(s),"i don't think that this movie was necessarily upsetting, it's just that in this mainstream culture that we are constantly bombarded with wherever we go, it's difficult, or we could say, challenging to step outside the rigorously defined borders of dictated confusion and try to emerge from this chaos with any sanity at all? and amidst all of this try to setup one's own set of 'perceived normalicy'. maybe this is a step in the wrong direction, after all can we honestly say that the '50's defined one-all-be-all template for success of 2 parents (m/f) and 2.5 kids in the suburbs is the perfect receipe for happiness? clearly this is not the society that we live in, nor should it necessarily be. but, as for this movie being some kind of ego stroke for men, just because again as hollywood dictates: the guy gets the girl; don't we all have our pressure points? i'm not trying to be antagonistic about this, i'm just trying to come to terms."
4,"I chased an ""Amy"" and won!","I like this movie and can not wait for it to come out on DVD.I fell in love with a lesbian and and in time she fell in love with me. She is now my fiancee and we are soon to be wed. Now, it did not happen quite like in the movie, but all you people who say this is a story that never happens well it does. It does work the other way around too, I know a guy who was bi and mainly dated guys, but this girl swept him off his feet and they are married with a kid!Anyway, I like the movie and you should pick it up"
1,the only thing that made this movie watchable was JayandBob,"I simply didn't like it. Mallrats and clerks were great. But, this movie is not mallrats and clerks.The plot is pointless and dull and there's no real conflict. If the characters would just comunicate then all the problems would be solved. Also, all subjects get boring if you talk about them long enough, even sex.I didn't like the main girl. Her voice sounds like a strained harp (especially during the emotional scenes) and I found myself nodding off when she talked.There was one good thing about this film; it made me appreiate jay and silent bob more than ever, even if they did have a small part. if you have to watch this movie, just fast forward to where they come in and skip the rest."
3,could have been so much better,"don't get me wrong, this is a fabulous film: funny in many ways and places. but what .... about it is that this is basically a film about a bisexual woman; kevin smith is supposed to be an innovative and brave bloke, so why either shy away from the actual truth about one of the most interesting characters i've seen in cinema recently, or alternativley pander to the hopes/dreams- and eventually fears- of sad straight blokes that this lesbian can somehow be converted, but then not after all. it could have been so much better. this aside, there are some ace bits for the discerning queer viewer too: the pronoun game played in reverse, ""just how long can a tongue be?"" et al. good for entertainment, i suppose: but not if you give a .... about the importance of tackling biphobia. watch it, if you want. she is quite cute after all!"
3,3/4 a great movie,This movie was very well done and believable right up until the climactic scene. (I won't ruin it) At that point the story loses credibility and becomes almost comical.
4,Jay and Silent Bob,"I like this movie, but not as much as Mall Rats or Clercks. This movie is funny in its portrayal of the pursuit of the unattainable. Which, once it is attained, of course it is not fully appreciated. There is a lot of crude humor in this film, so it is definitely not appropriate for children. I enjoyed watching the cut scenes and the outtakes. A must see for Jay and ""Silent"" Bob fans."
4,tragicomic,"There's just something about unattainable love. OK, so he's no Shakespeare, but I did appreciate that Smith bypassed the usual happily-ever-after Hollywood ending for an older-and-wiser (but alone) one. Holden (Affleck) shows great fallability, and misunderstanding, of himself and his friends, just like the rest of us punters. Silent Bob's treatise on 'Chasing Amy' rung true, with many of us viewers nodding appreciatvely, or slapping our foreheads. I laughed, I cried, I rented it again.Other little details I noticed the second time through were the various references and homages Smith played to his first 2 movies (which I saw out of sequence), as this is the 3rd of his so-called 'New Jersey trilogy.' There's something to be said for continuity.Overall, Smith is a brilliant writer, and this piece definitely shows an observation of people and love not usually granted us by the usual Hollywood pap."
4,Good MOVIE not really that great of a DVD,"First let me start by saying this is a great movie. I love the (spoiler coming) limited use of Jay and Silent Bob because it shows that this is a far more serious film than the other View Askewniverse films.However, this isn't a great DVD. It has no behind the scenes/making of segment, which, if you're like me, is one of the main reasons for buying a ""special edition"" copy of the DVD. Also, the ""colored bars"" feature is stupid"
5,Kevin Smith Rocks,"Kevin Smith is very creative with his movies, i always like his humor and own all of his movies. a must have."
3,DON'T THROW AWAY YOUR DOLLARS,"This movies is the kind of movie one would watch on a rainy Sunday afternoon when there is absolutely nothing else to watch, or nothing else to do.I wouldn't spend money on a movie like this."
2,read review to find out,This movie was trashy and stupid. The plot had no point. The girl was a slut. It had bad language. It had sexual situations. Children should not she it. All they talk about through the whole movie are blow-jobs and threesomes.
2,'Till the other shoe drops,"Interesting but pretty improbable, and ultimately it will be unworkable. It should have been written as a tragedy instead it is a farce."
2,241,"241. That is the amount of obscene words you would never want your kids to hear that I counted in this film. 241. That averages out to over two a minute. I am an adult, this is R rated, but come on. The potential screwball situation would have been hilarious if Smith did not keep dishing out one awkward scene for every funny one. Watch his actors sometimes run out of breath trying to recite dialogue no one has ever said in real life. As it plays, Lee and Ewell are the only reasons to see this."
1,This movie is part of The Criterion Collection?,How did this movie make The Criterion Collection? We are supposed to believe that this second-rate film stands beside great masterpieces as The Grand Illusion and The Seventh Seal. I would not buy that in a million years. What were they thinking? What film will make The Criterion Collection next? Porky's?
3,Funny but slow,"A lot of my friends like this movie, however it does not appeal to me. This show talks about how ben affleck fall in love with a lesbian. Nice plot and funny lines. But somehow it is a bit slow and at certain times it is very draggy. Trust me, you might be watching it once and that is it. For me, this has no re-watch value."
4,What matters is that you love me Now,"Has someone ever judged you harshly on your imperfect personal history? Whether or not you answered yes or no, this film will make you question your own views about passing judgment on others' pasts. In a nutshell, Chasing Amy is boy meets girl, they fall in love, then it all comes crashing down in a matter of minutes. In renting this movie, I was seeking light-hearted fun, but what I got was much, much better than that. The acting was very good! The golden line in this film is ""What matters is that you love me NOW, right?"" Right?? Wrong? You decide. There's no universal answer. The ending was sort of shocking but it ices the cake nicely. Highly recommended for couples who are in the early 'getting to know you' stages. very good movie with zero sugar coating"
5,Smith's best work to date!!,"No matter how people deal with homosexualityn in real life, it never really comes off right on the big screen or small screen. This work from writer/director/actor Kevin Smith interprets it very well. The best I've ever seen, actually. It seems as if he knows people who are gay and studied about them. I bet he has, too. It has great actors and the best script Smith ever wrote so far. They all seemed like real people with real problems. A wonderful film that is almost perfect in every way."
5,Kevin Smith & View Askew deliver as always,When I first saw Chasing Amy my jaw dropped. The flim had heart and made you think about love and where it takes you. The plot revolves around Holden( the excellent Ben Affleck) who along with his sidekick Banky (the also excellent Jason Lee) have a comic called BluntMan and Chronic. When Holden falls for Alyssa Jones it therants their realtionship. This storyline is played out excellent by the cast and each cast memeber has a scene stealing line. The best two scenes are at the comic convention with Hooper X and the apperance of Jay and Silent Bob. Rent this flick along with Dogma for a great night.
5,Just simply a great movie!!!,"Just a good twist on the old love story. Kevin Smith made a true movie that touches the heart. Exploring the deeper longings of emotions and the need to be accepted and loved even in todays rigid ""rule"" and ""accepted codes"", this shows two people who try to rise above their past, even if one can't rise above the other's. Classic ""tis better to have loved and have lost..."" story. The twist and acting is excellent. Even Ben Affleck, who I can't stand as a rule, I found cheering and even sad for at the end. The moral is simple...and it's explained better than I could ever say at the end of the movie. Easily my favorite movie, and in my opinion, the best Kevin Smith movie ever made."
5,Straight up lovely.,"Kevin Smith's marvelous third film, Chasing Amy, is a beautiful story of romance with a twist you'll never forget: ""this girl is gay."" Joey Lauren Adams, Kevin Smith's one time lover, also appears in Mallrats, but this is the role you'll remember her from. Her performance is powerful and convincing. And Ben Affleck's role is so amazing it gat him marked as a ""rising star."" Watch this film to make your own opinion, but if you are anything like me, you'll laugh, cry, and want to appear in Smith's next film."
2,Not one for the ages...,"I have a vague memory of having seen this film in the theater after it came out and having left it feeling like Kevin Smith had touched my soul. Perhaps it was because I too had been ""Involved"" with a couple of ""Lesbians"" in my college years and felt the film somehow spoke to me. Some years later I rented this one again, having just seen Clerks again recently. Let it be known that I belive Clerks is pure genius. Chasing Amy was painfull to watch. The dialogue comes off as though it were written by a high-school sophomore and made me wince on at least one occasion: during the Coming Out seen when Amy is sitting on the tire swing and describing how her friends pleasure each other. It has a few moments, but Chasing Amy will not make it in to my DVD collection next tomy copy of Clerks. I find it somehow fitting then that I have found out that the ""Lesbians"" I knew in college are now married (to Men) and having kids and going to being wifey."
3,the worst of the five,"it is a kevin smith movie, and the last one of the jay and silent bob movies i needed for the set.not my favorite, but certainly no 'jersey girl'!!"
1,"I liked this movie when it came out, but I've grown up.","This film is a shameful commentary on homosexuality-- suggesting that men and women can just ""turn it off"" when they want to. This film is what I call ""sensitive chauvinism."" It comes accross as harmless, though it is really offensive on many levels when you look a little below the surface.Also, it's a ""chick flick"" for guys who think they're too cool for ""chick flicks."" Smith tries to mask the melodrama and sappiness of this film by throwing in a lot of crude language and crude discussions-- but once you get past that, you may as well be watching Notting Hill.Kevin Smith is perhaps the most overrated director out there right now. His characters are nothing more than one dimensional caricatures and his dialogue stinks. His ""comedy' is crude and often insulting. He has made a living off making films for insecure young men who live in their parents' basements."
1,"Bad acting, worse script","Chasing Amy has plot holes to spare. The characters are a predictable mix-and-match assemblage of Issues (e.g., He's homophobic and angry. Hmm. Must be gay.) with which each of their friends and lovers must dutifully cope in their best psychobabble. It has all the drama of watching someone taking batting practice with a pitching machine. Some scenes are so forced and stilted that they are uncomfortable to watch, and Affleck shows the full range of emotions from A to A-flat. Rent before buying."
2,"See, I told you","All it really takes to cure a lesbian of her silly, silly ways is for her to find the right man. A sensitive guy, who likes comic books and kung fu movies and knows all five Star Wars movies back to front. A guy who might be a little bit overweight and who (frankly) doesn't have the widest acting range around, but who's just ""a regular joe."" I mean, what woman wouldn't go crazy over a guy like this?Thank you, Kevin Smith, and God bless you."
2,Running from amy,"I'm giving this movie 2 stars out of pity. Trite characters, contrived script, average to sub-par acting, and bland directing. I can't believe anyone would like this movie let alone give it 5 stars. Have any of these people seen Dr.Strangelove or Wild Strawberries? Christ my shoelaces have more talent than Kevin Smith."
2,The only Kevin Smith disappointment,"I have seen them all, Clerks, Mallrats, Dogma, Jay and Silent Bob Stike Back, adn Chasing Amy is the biggest diappointment of a movie. Kevin Smith's writing was still amazing and it had a somewhat good cast, but the story line was one that made me want to hit myself. I would not recommend this movie to may other unless your into that is she or isnt she a lesbian thing with Ben Affleck turning her back and forth. Go with any of the other movies. This hurts me to say how bad this movie was. But I will anywasy only becasue I love Kevin Smith and expect more out of his storylines."
2,"If you're looking for comedy, look elsewhere","When I first saw this movie, I had never seen one of Kevin Smith's movies, or even heard of him, so I didn't really know what to expect, although I'd heard this movie was something of a comedy. It started out great, with the first 10 minutes putting me on the floor in hysterics. I didn't laugh through the rest of the film. While the movie is interesting as a kind of tragic love story, and very well written, it was almost devoid of any sort of humor, which was what I was looking for. If you're looking for a powerful, tragic romance, this is the movie for you. If you want something funny, watch the first 10 minutes and then turn it off."
3,CHASING AMY,"Not too bad. More entertaining than most other 90's movie regarding such a topic. Buy it if you like the Jay and Silent Bob movies. I, however, find them rather dull"
2,Who cares....,"Probably the most overrated films of 1997. I watched this film with various degrees of interest. The acting was for the most part flat and uninvolving and the writing a little smug. I really believe that the ending was a series of ides written on scraps of paper,thrown in a hat pulled out and shot in sequence. Chasing Amy a criterion collection Dvd? No it should be part of a giveaway Buy Mallrats get a copy of Chasing Amy."
2,Slobs of New Jersey,"Quite bluntly, ""Chasing Amy"" is a terrible movie; one I never would have gotten through had I not decided to drink a beer. I'm only giving it a generous two stars because as a NJ ex-pat myself, I could take a certain pleasure in the feeling that I've ""escaped"". Escaped from the crudeness, hostility, shallowness, insensitivity, provincialism and faux-hipness that that part of the country represents to me, among other things. Never mind the seriously flawed-&-full-of holes plot; these characters have some severe anger & hatred issues, especially the ""Banky"" person, (not to mention the twisted ""Jay"" creature).I pity anyone for whom the ambience of ""Chasing Amy"" reflects reality as they know it and live it."
3,Criterion Collection for This One? You're not serious!,"For a few of my friends I recommended that they see this film. It's entertaining. This film, however, is not fine filmmaking, nor is it all that artistic. It's a low budget-- and it looks low budget -- moderately entertaining film. Does this film rate the Criterion Collection? It's not even close! It's a cute little film at best! I suggest you see it. As far the people raving about this one as a great film.... Are we talking about the same film?"
3,ok but no clerks,"good movie, not quite criterion worthy, but still nice to see it gets some cool packaging instead of the s***y special edition of clerks, but at least that clerks 3-disc set is coming out this year, id say rent this, youll probably like, and if you do, go ahead and buy it but if you dont like this, save your $$$ for the 3-disc set of clerks, which is always a great film to watch just to kill 90 minutes, and laugh your a** off doing it"
1,Absolute Rubbish,"This is one of the worst films I've seen since ""Forrest Gump."" I'm not sure where to begin my criticism: with the boring plot, immature & annoying dialogue, or the generally shoddy filmmaking. If you want to see a lovely gay comedy, see ""Billy's Hollywood Screen Kiss,"" ""Beatiful Thing,"" or ""Get Real."" Don't waste your time on this rubbish."
1,I stayed up for THIS ?,"When i started watching chasing amy i loved it thought i might want to record it WELL THANK GOD I DIDN'T. The first part of chasing amy i loved but the end was simply Idiotic.this movie was a total letdown and i wish i had never seen it. Jay & silent bob didn't show up till the end,which totally.... I could have written this movie better...."
1,Chasing Amy is always great BUT...,"...if you're like me, looking to upgrade your favorite movies to Blu Ray, you can wait until this gets a proper domestic release. The sharp picture just isn't there on this import. In all bluntness it looks like this Canadian studio just re released the Chasing Amy DVD on to a Blu Ray Disc and called it ""Blu Ray"" because there just isn't any clarity to the picture like you've come to notice with ""real"" Blu Ray. So to sum up: Chasing Amy story=fantastic. Chasing Amy on this ""Blu Ray"" release=Horrible. Same clarity as the DVD version.Late,grmpysmrf"
4,Chasing Amy - Criterion Collection,""" Definitely one of Kevin Smith's best. A great comeback after the Cult Classic Mall Rats. A perfect blend of drama and comedy. """
5,Chasing Amy Rocks!,Having seen Chasing Amy on the premium movie channels a number of times I knew I had to purchase it for my film library. This film just works on so many levels. The characters are so interesting and the relationships to intense and real. A definate must have....
4,close to the heart,"this movie has always been close to my heart for the very simple reason that i've been 'chasing amy' for most of my life.god help straight men who fall in love with a lesbian.if you're like me you've actually been told that you were the only one,only to find out that their past is not what you thought it was.this movie shows this,unlike any other film that i've ever seen,and that is another reason why it is so special to me.finally someone has had a similar experience,or at least has written about it.the movie throws in a twist that i have not experienced,but all the better.well written and directed by kevin smith,his second best next to clerks."
1,A pointless book with a lot of bad pictures,"Little, if any, useful exposure information, but plenty of bad pictures that will readily show you how not to compose photographs. Save your money and avoid this book."
3,"Not Exactly Ansel Adams, but...",The reviewer from North Carolina must have a burr up his/her saddle.I saw this book at my local Borders Books and fund it very informative with photographs that clearly illustrated each unique exposure dilemas.
2,Not so much......,I have read other books by this author and enjoyed them. I could not get into this book. The entire story feels very disjointed and I had a hard time keeping the flow of the story straight. One minute the characters are talking about who done it and the next they are making eyes at each with no natural segway! Couldn't even finish the book!
1,In reality it is twice more expensive,"They did shipment quickly. But they sent me not 12 packs with 6 doses each, but 12 packs with 3 doses each!Today (4/4/09) I sent request to Customer Service of Red Tag about the problem. I'll post result here.(4/18/09) Update: Ideal Customer service. They sent to me paid envelope to return item and refunded all charges (I got money back at (4/15/09). They also explained me it was just mistyped product description. I wish all Sellers are so committed to the clients."
4,Still a great movie,"What's there to say? It's Ghostbusters. If you liked the movie, then you'll like the blu-ray. The image quality is a little grainy, but it wasn't notable while watching the movie. Only when I focused in on it.There are some negatives about the extra features. I'm not too big on extra features, but for those who are, they only transferred the features from the DVD release. They were not upgraded for Blu-ray resolutions, and the movie states this when you attempt to view the extras. BUT, at least they ARE still included. There are a few new extras in HD though."
5,Ghostbusters,Love it! This movie reminds me of my youth. It arrived quickly and was in perfect shape.
4,Hilarious mock-heroic epic of Biblical proportions,"Hilarious mock-heroic epic of Biblical proportions. . .This is a spoof of every bit of para-psychological nonsense, elevated to the nth degree.Hilarious classic."
5,The perfect movie,"To me this is the perfect movie for everyone to see. Unlike a lot of movies now a days that rely on disgusting toilet and sex humor, out-dated pop culture references and a lot of unnecessary violence, this movie fits the taste of anyone who watches it. It's a romantic comedy, it's a supernatural thriller mystery, it's a paranormal action movie, it's all sorts of great movie Genres all rolled into one movie!I highly recommend Ghostbusters!"
2,Bad Transfer/Remaster,"I agree with the previous review. The video and audio transfers are truely among the worst I have ever experienced. The picture is grainy and the sound has discernable noise.Frankly, I feel a bit cheated."
5,Fun movies.,Good movies and it's interesting how much the effects have advanced. These movies now look a bit dated.
4,Deleted Scenes Don't Work,"I was very excited to get this DVD version of one of my favorite old movies, but when I popped it in I found the deleted scenes extra (and one of the other extra features - can't remember which) wouldn't work, neither on my DVD player nor on my computer... ok, bad disc I thought... So I exchanged it for another which has ended up having the exact same problem.Someone mentioned having this problem in a November 29, 2001 review so I wonder if there's a ""bad batch"" out there that has some sort of corruption?Otherwise, the menus are a little cheesy, but the film looks and sounds great, and I enjoyed the trivia subtitles feature while watching the movie - all sorts of new things to learn about this wonderful movie!"
4,Revisit the 80s!!!!,"What a blast from the past! I loved these films as a kid, and they really stand the test of time. The special effects don't look nearly as out of date as in other films from the same era. The jokes are still funny because they're timeless. It's great to see Aykroyd and Ramis subtly interact underneath some really witty dialogue, only to let Murray take it completely over the top.The first disc contains some interesting interviews with the cast looking back on ""Ghostbusters,"" as well as some behind the scenes featurettes and deleted scenes. The second disc contains two episodes of the cartoon. These movies are still fun & make a great double feature. Who you gonna call?"
5,Dead Funny,"I ain't afraid of no ghost because they make me laugh. In this 1984 comedy, Bill Murray, Dan Ackroyd, and Harold Ramis play paranormal investigator/exterminators who go around New York City hunting ghosts. At first, business is bad, but all of the sudden, the phones are ringing off the hook. They believe it to be luck, but when Murray's girlfriend (Sigourney Weaver) and her neighbor (Rick Moranis) become possessed, they must find the source of these paranormal occurences. It all culminates to the famous battle between the Ghostbusters and the Sta-Puft Marshmallow Man! You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll... SCREAM!"
5,The greatest movie ever made.,I've been a fan of Ghostbusters since it first came out.It has been and always will be my favorite movie.This DVD is by far one of the best Ghostbusters items made.The interactivity menu is top notch and the faetures are by far some of the best of any dvd out there.I highly recomned this DVD.
5,fantastic showcase of DVD extra features and a great movie!,Buy this DVD regardless of whether you like cool extra features that DVD's have or you're a Ghostbusters fan who knows every line by heart. You won't be disappointed. A must. Go buy it now.
5,A really gold clasic,"Picture quality is amazing!!, and the audio is perfect the Dolby 5.1 is incredible and, well, we all know the Ghostbusters, a really clasic to own."
5,A must have disc,This is a wonderful disc. The extras are some of the best that I have ever seen. My one and only complaint is that the menu is too confusing. However even that is not enough to make me give this disc a bad review.
2,Is this really blu-ray quality,"Lots of noise in the dark scenes that can't be attributed to my LCD screen. Unlike other blu-ray titles, I have to view further away to avoid noticing pixilation on faces."
3,Edited.,"I've probably watched Ghostbusters fifty or sixty times since I was seven years old. I know the movie word-for-word and scene-for-scene. It's edited, ostensibly for length.If this bothers you, avoid this disc. If it doesn't, enjoy a classic comedy on the go."
1,Terrible Blu-ray Quality,"This review is not about the film itself, which is great. This review is about the terrible quality of the Blu-Ray conversion. While some scenes are prestine, you'll get some scenes that are so grainy you'll think your watching through a sandstorm. Save yourself some money and pass on this version."
4,Cheap as heck and the transfer is upgraded!,"Well, this isn't packed with special features, but it's sure worth more than two stars. After all, what do you expect for a double-feature (each film is in its own thin-pak case) plus episodes of the cartoon (which it will be great to reminisce while watching, by the way) and a scrapbook at such a low price?The real treat that home theater enthusiasts and most people with eyes will appreciate is that the transfers have been remastered and are marvelous-looking. That alone makes this a good companion to the old discs (KEEP THE OLD RELEASES because the video commentary from the first Ghostbusters DVD isn't on this new one and the neither are theatrical trailers). e-mail me for a link to comparison pics of the transfer upgrades! Worth an upgrade for home theater enthusiasts and fans of the cartoon (and fans of cool gimmick packaging, too, I guess!)."
1,Terrible transfer of a great movie.,"Seriously, the quality is awful. The picture is grainy. Really grainy. Almost unwatchably grainy. Unless you have a player that will allow you to soften the picture... a lot... then just buy the DVD. And someone remind me to change my settings back to normal so other movies will still have outlines."
2,Cheap DVD gift set but terrible transfer!,I enjoy the Ghostbusters movies but I bought the Ghostbusters gift pack and it's a great set but the transfer is horrible. It is in widescreen. They do have two animated episodes from the Real Ghostbusters cartoon on Ghostbusters 2 features but it's about the same from the original Ghostbusters DVD nothing really new just a new Ghostbusters cover and it comes with a great movie scrapbook but the set is a lot better than the original Ghostbusters DVD cover. I would recommend to get this set to collect both Ghostbusters movies. Only if your a Ghostbusters fan.
1,No difference between Blu-ray and upconverted DVD,"I had Ghostbusters on regular DVD, but not on Blu-ray, so I bought this. It is the grainiest Blu-ray that I own. Since I had the regular DVD, I ran the regular DVD in my PS3 and swapped in the Blu-ray to compare. No difference whatsoever. People giving this Blu-ray a good review love Ghostbusters, not the Blu-ray version particularly. I challenge you to get a regular DVD version of this and compare with the Blu-ray version. No difference whatsoever. You could even make this a double blind study if you covered the labels;)"
5,Ghostbusters: A Classic,"I love this movie!!! It is so much fun...it is always great to watch. I just got the DVD and it is great....the trailers, the widescreen, the three featurettes, the before & after special effects scenes. Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Harold Ramis, Sigourney Weaver, Ernie Hudson, and Rick Moranis are all great. It is so funny...and so FUN to watch. This is one of the greatest movies ever and something that everyone can enjoy. Ghostbusters 2 is great too and I can't wait to get that DVD in the mail...also, I kind of hope they don't make a third film and lessen the greatness of ""Ghostbusters"" films....GHOSTBUSTERS rules!"
3,"Not, to much different.","I already own Ghostbusters on DVD. My ritual is... when I upgrade a movie to a Blu-ray, I like to play both and make the comparison. With my brother present (Whom I'm trying to convince to make the jump over to Blu-ray) I played a scene from both formats... I found myself embarrassed and stammering for excuses. Aside from an almost unnoticeable step up in detail... There really wasn't any difference. Although I have read, ""Not to expect a 25-year-old film to look as good as one that was released last summer""."
5,Ghostbusters are GUT busters!,"This comedy is so well crafted, one has to wonder why others haven't capitalized on the motiff since the Abbot and Costello days!Here we are, twenty one years later, and it's humor still endures. The Busters are misfits... talking their own brand of techno-babble, dedicated to snaring the very ""ghosts"" that most don't believe in.The supporting characters, such as Rick Moranis, Annie Potts and Ernie Hudson are just as funny as the SNL and CS veterans. Signorney Weaver (sp?) plays an effective ""straight"" character in distress.The busters are both brilliant and bumbling. The youngish Bill Murrey delivers his typical ""Rogue,"" thus he is the one that gets the ""girl.""Who among us can forget ""slimer,"" or the ""Stay Puff"" marshmellow man? Remember, when a transdimensional demonic invader asks you if you're a ""god,"" always say ""YES!""Jeff Messenger, author of the novel ""the Shroud of Torrington."""
4,I loved these movies when I was a kid.,"I purchased this set, because I loved ghostbuster when I was a kid. I must say the original movie is good, but the second movie has a terrible story. Anyway, they are a classic."
5,ghostbusters is a classic,This is a timeless movie representing physical comedy and farce with actors who grew to be stars in their own right
2,Avoid the VHS version,"Okay, first off, the 2 stars are for the *video itself*, not the movie. The movie is hilarious and very well done -- 4.5 stars. Unfortunately, the VHS version is terrible. The screen reformatting is horrendous -- the ""pan and scan"" isn't smooth at all, and the coloring is obviously off at some points. Get the DVD instead."
5,Ghostbusters Double Feature Gift Set - DVD,"Directed by: Ivan ReitmanStarring: Bill Murray and Dan Aykroyd.Running Time: 1 hr 45 mins 1984The movie Ghostbusters premiered over 25 years ago and watching it for the first time since its VHS release I have to say it still stands the test of time. Bill Murray is at his finest and the subtle humor I missed as a kid is even more humorous today. I also really liked the music, it added a lot to the movie.I viewed the movie as part of the Ghostbusters 2 Disc Gift Set which looked really good upscaled. Watching some of the extras it became clear that Dan Aykroyd has become a strange man.I may have seen Ghostbusters as a kid, but now I have enjoyed it as an adult. I highly recommend seeing it again."
5,Awesome set of awesome movies.,"Ghostbusters 1 & 2 are amazing movies and finally we get a great set with pleasing extra's. This set features the two great films on DVD, extra commentaries and an book with notes, information and photo's from the movies. Great set, great price."
1,Agree with others on the poor transfer to blu-ray,"I have to agree with that others that the transfer to blu-ray was very poorly done! Actually, my VHS tape displays more clearly than this blu-ray. Of course, the movie is fantastic, but on this media, it's not worth the money. I'm going to have to get the DVD version, if I can find one."
2,You call this Blu-Ray?,"Great movie, lousy picture. The picture quality was so grainy that I couldn't tell the difference between this and a DVD version of the movie. 1080p should mean something. Oh well, not the end of the world. Classic '80s movie...never gets old."
5,"I am Vinze Clortho, Keymaster of Gozer","""Would you like some ah coffee Mr Tully?"" ""Do I?"" ""Yes, have some."" ""Yes have some""Best part in the entire movie. I acted like Lewis Tully, after he was posessed, and people thought I was drunk, it is the best movie there ever was! The props are marvelous, the acting is amazing, the effects are still effective, and the comedy goes on and on (like me). This thing deserves a 10 or a 12!!""I think we can get her a guest shot on Wild Kingdom"""
3,80s Film,Horror/ comedy about a four pair of ghost busters in New York. A woman's refridgerator door leads to the gates of hell. The stay puff marshmellow man appears at the end. Stars Bill Murray and Sigourney Weaveer.
2,the worst DVD menu I have seen so far. Totally confusing.,"A terrible menu, and a so-called ""Video Commentary"" which is nothing more than a lot of unnecessary and often silly sub-titles. It could have been a great DVD, but the extras spoil it."
3,Reservations about Ramis,He really wasn't that big an actor (still isn't to this day) to be billed as one of the top three ghostbusters of this movie. We got a lot of him and not enough of Ackroyd (who was and still is) in this horror comedy caper. Not quite Abott and Costello as this film is highy suggestive in it's humor but that's another point.
3,"Good Product, Poor Service","When I purchased this product, I had not intended for it be in my cart at the time, and so mistakenly paid for it. However, when i realized my mistake and went to correct it a few hours later, I found that i was unable to cancel the item because it was being ""Prepared for Shipping"". While the product itself is great, i am dissatisfied with the service I have received from Amazon."
2,Ghostbusters,"Shipping and seller was great, but the game cannot be played by more than one player which causes conflict if you have more than one child. It is a disappointment considering my 9 yr old would rather watch the movie than play the game"
4,Total blast,"A childhood of my generation would not be complete without the story of ""Ghostbusters"". This is fun madcap adventures dabbling into the mocked up world of the occult. Here are the classic lines and scenes in all their glory. It's a comedic blast that just has to be kept around."
2,Ghostbusters [Blu-ray],"This is a review of the Ghostbusters [Blu-ray] release, not the movie itself.First let me state I am not a true technophile. I really don't know a great deal about the differences between resolutions, other than know that one resolution looks better than another. I have seen a lot of things in high definition and while I sometimes think it can be too much for some movies, I've rarely seen anything that looked bad... until now.The transfer on this version is complete garbage. It looks so bad that the DVD versionGhostbusters Double Feature Gift Set (Ghostbusters / Ghostbusters 2 + Commemorative Book), which I already have, looks BETTER. Even if they GAVE this Blu-ray away for FREE, it still wouldn't be worth owning. It saddens me to think that a beloved movie can be treated like utter trash by the movie studios who clearly rushed this version out just to make a quick buck.Take my advice: save your money and wait until Sony releases a restored version."
2,quality,the picture quality was blurry some time for paying 5 bucks but the over all movie was great love bill murry
4,Funny classic movie!,We love this movie it is so funny. Great vaule and shipping was fast. Its a must have for your collection. Family movie night for older kids.
5,Who ya gonna call the best movie ever Ghostbusters,Look I loved the Ghostbusters since I was a new born baby. Im 15 now and watching them on fox famiely channel. But I cant wait for the release of the DVD feature of it. I want to see it a little renewed i just brought the first movie in a store about a month ago. Oh well I will still by the new one. And dont let anybody tell you the second movie was'nt good becuase it was great. I liked it when the statue of liberty was walking. You gotta egmit that was pretty cool.
5,Ghostbusters Box,This was in great shape and less than if I bought it at Best Buy. I loved the Ghostbuster movies. I'm glad I can now replace my old VHS tape with the DVD of the movies.
5,My husband and I love the Ghostbusters!!!,We love it. I don't know how many times we have watched it since we have got it.(Alot).
3,Always fun,"Bought this for my 9 year old and was horror struck with some of the adult content in the first movie- Sigourney Weaver throws Bill Murray on the bed and mounts him!Would not reccommend the first movie for children. On the other hand, the second was fun and only a brief adult moment."
5,Enjoyable old-school,"This is definitely a classic film with some great actors. The CGI will seem clunky compared to all the fancy films you see today, but the storyline is funny and solid, and is one of the good films of the decade, and the scenes with the Sta-Puft Marshmallow Man are definitely lulzy. Overall, A-."
1,Shame on you Sony!,"I am not going into reviewing this item as there is plenty available. But I want to say SHAME ON YOU SONY for putting a lengthly self congratulatory commercial at the beginning of the movie, you cannot get out and to the main menu, a confusing like hell menu, not one but 4 warnings of this or that before to finally coming to the movie. This is a disgrace on top of BD being SLOOOOOOOOOOOOOOW to finally get to do something useful."
3,unbias review from ghostbusters fan,"ok.. i bought this just to compare to the hd one i recorded off HBO HD from Dish..thoughts:-alot of the scenes look amazing for the year that this movie was made.+i had said MOST because there are alot of scenes that are just beyond grainy and get on my nerves. Im running a ps3 blu ray with a nice 50'' samsung plasma and proper hdmi cables.. its the transfer, not my equipment.-audio is great for the most part as well.-bonus features are nice to have..-packaging is attractive to the eyefinal decision:i like the one i recorded from hbo.. honestly - id rather have a 1080i that is pretty good 100% of the time, than a picture thats incredible for the movie but only 60% of the time, and 40% is grainy.. (those %'s are just estimates)"
1,BAD BLU RAY TRANSFER,"I LOVE THIS MOVIE AND HATE TO GIVE IT A 1 BUT THIS IS NOT BLU RAY QUALITY, THERE IS NO WAY THEY HAVE DONE ONE UPGRADE TO THIS FILM VERY GRAINY. I KEEP CHECKING TO SEE IF THERE IS ANOTHER VERSION OF THE MOVIE ON THIS DISK IT IS THAT BAD. SAVE YOUR MONEY"
1,horrible,"I wait 3 weeks for a copy of Ghostbusters blu-ray and i get a cheap, chewed, torn up library copy of the movie. I was very disappointied because i love this movie a lot and my expectations were just shattered."
1,Worst-looking Blu-Ray I own,"The grain/static in this Blu-Ray makes it unwatchable. Of all the Blu-Rays I own, it's the only one where I use my old DVD version (the original DVD release) instead. That's a travesty for such an adored film. The picture quality is awful. Don't waste your money."
3,Classic movie but bad blu ray transfer : (,A hilarious film with a great cast as we all know.Many memorable lines that we can still quote to this day.Just an over all classic movie.I was afraid this movie would not hold up to the times.As a kid I thought it was great but I had not seen it in a long time.However it holds up very well and still is one of the funniest films ever made.The effects do not hold up over time but I'm fine with that.My main complaint is simply the blu ray transfer.It just wasn't given the treatment it deserves.Is it better then DVD yes but I have seen older movies that have been cleaned up better than this.I hope for and expect another much better looking transfer to be released on blu ray around the time Ghostbusters 3 hits the theaters.So I would say hold off but if this ends up being the only option grab it because it is still a great film and to date the best looking that you can get.The movie gets a 4 star but this item gets a 3 star.
4,Check out the original!,If you liked Ghost Busters as I did then you might enjoy the film that may have been it's inspiration. The film is from the 1950's and is called Ghost Breakers starring Bob Hope. Amazing how many films popular in our times seem to spring from earlier works. Enjoy!$crooge
4,Hilarious,"I had not seen this movie in years. But I had to buy it, because I was going to teach my little 2 years old guy to aim true into the toilet bowl. He heard the term to cross beams all the time. And I wanted to show him where the term came from.Anyway, very hilarious movie. You just don't see the talents of Bill Murray and Dan Aykroyd, etc anymore."
3,Too Much Hype,"I saw this movie at the show in the 1980s. I thought the movie didn't match the hype. I thought it was kinda dumb. I loved the popular theme song though - ""Who you gonna call?"" ""Ghostbusters!"""
2,What did I expect...,I remembered watching this in a theatre.I didn't remember all the 'spirit' issues that they deal with. Not what we need in this home!
1,BORING! - but nice DVD...,"The only people who seem to like this movie are the ones that saw it in the theater when it came out. It's called nostalgia. For anyone watching this movie for the first time on DVD, you will be very disappointed.The DVD itself has a very high quality transfer and excellent extra features. So if you are already a fan, you will be very pleased indeed."
3,Who You Gonna Call .....Ghostbusters!,"While this is a great movie from 1984. I must say the Bluray conversion is a little grainy, it does have some special features and other modes. But I was expecting something high def. This is a trip down memory lane and has nostalgia, if you want to own a Ghostbusters movie, this is probably it. But hopes were higher for something more special. only 3/5 stars"
4,Great!,"Great vintage movie, watching quality was very good, package was sealed and no cosmetic flaws on or inside packaging. Great!"
3,Bad Remaster,"The remaster screwed up the colours of Ghosbusters 1 and the cut-down menus look cheap. Also, the packaging is ugly. On the other hand, the booklet is cute and the two real ghostbusters episodes are welcome. However, I still feel that this release is worse than the 1999 one."
1,WARNING - HORRIBLE TRANSFER - ORIGINAL DVD IS BETTER!,"This is one of my all-time favorite movies. But the Blu-Ray transfer is so shamefully bad I couldn't bear to watch more than a few minutes. It looks like they transferred an old theatrical print that sat for 20 years in a moldy apartment. The grain is HUGE and the image actually flickers from time to time. The original DVD transfer may be more compressed, but it's far more watchable than the Blu-Ray.It's a pity SONY didn't try a little harder to release a quality product."
4,Is This True?,"Yes it's true- this blu ray transfer has grain. But don't let that stop you from picking this up. While the grain can become bothersome to the eye after a while you can tell they did make an attempt to clean it up a bit. I do hope in the future it actually is a true HD transfer and not something that looks like a upconverted dvd. Sound was alright, nothing to write home about.The special features however are great. Slimer Mode is well worth the price of this blu ray, something that could never make it to a regular dvd with the amount of audio/video. The special on the restoration of the original ECTO 1 was awesome. Also the fact that all the original special features from the previous dvd releases made it to blu ray was a great bonus.Bottom line is to pick this up if you are a diehard. If you call yourself a child of the 80's this is a must. Hopefully the image will improve down the road."
4,Classic comedy,"This is merely a classic comedy, think about it, Dan Aykryod, Bill Murray, Rick Moranis, Annie Potts, Harold Ramis..can you get any better than that? This movie is not only hilarious but also very goofy. It's just a little goofy comedy. Bill Murray is wonderful as always. Anyone who thinks this is a ""kiddie film"" should be punished. The cartoon was made AFTER the movie poeple!"
5,virginia beach movie goer,"absolutley one of the best movies i have ever seen..it is one of my top 10 movies of all time..bill murray and dan akroyd are great and so is the supporting cast...the story line is rather typical, but good...it is just so darn funny...if you haven't seen this movie you really should give it a try"
3,"Would have loved this, but it is not a stock item?",Tried to order this and the order was canceled several days later. Stated it was out of stock. Bummer. :(
1,No help,"I was so disappointed in this book, which I purchased only after reading positive reviews on Amazon. If you believe that imagining your ""wolf mother"" and various figures from Greek mythology will help you get over betrayal, then this is your book. This book is full of arcane references, dream sequences, illogical guided imagery and other rot from ""the new age"" - none of which are concrete enough to help people today.Couldn't even give it to the Goodwill, as the previous owner had underlined extensively in the first chapter - and then apparently gave up reading the rest."
3,Misleading photo,"The product appears to be what I ordered, but I was careless in reading the detail (0.08 oz bottles) and misled by the photo of the 0.34 oz bottle - which is the only size I had seen before.Buyer beware.Otherwise it's a great product."
2,Not durable enough for a classroom setting.,"This is a cute puzzle but is too thin to use anywhere but a home setting, and probably wouldn't last long there either."
4,Great for girls,"As Jenna Song gets ready for a three day sports camp, she's so competitive that no one else on her team can do anything right in her eyes. She wants to be the best. In fact, she wants to be better than the best! Irritation at her team members and Nels Ansgar, the gorgeous new spotter, cause lies and envy on Jenna's part. In the end, she must realize that unless she and her team want to fail, they must pull together and help one another.Great book for girls!"
2,Save your money,"I was fairly disappointed with this book, I was hoping for it to concentrate more on the photography aspect rather than photo-editing techniques. It feels more like a Photoshop book with a 32 page introduction to digital cameras written for a graphic designer, not a photographer."
5,A top pick and 'must',"The revised edition of ADVANCED DIGITAL PHOTOGRAPHY: TECHNIQUES & TIPS FOR CREATING PROFESSIONAL QUALITY IMAGES provides plenty of easy tips to enable novices with the basics to move to the next level of photography technology management. Here are tips on correcting distortion, scanning techniques, dodging and other advanced photo manipulation techniques - all with plenty of color photo examples, all with boxed tips making for quick, at-a-glance instruction. A top pick and 'must' for any general interest or specialty library strong in digital photo guides.Diane C. DonovanCalifornia Bookwatch"
3,Not a bad guide,"On checking the local listings, I had already been to every place listed in this book and the winery listings are very out of date. The Jewel this book listed for Prosser, ,WA is probably the ugliest winery in the Yakima Valley.Other listings appeared to be fairly accurate but not very well researched. Overall the book would still be pretty useful. Title should be changed to *Good Places....* because the Best Places aren't listed."
3,It's ok,Someone told me to purchase this book and it was cheap on Amazon.com. Not quite what I thought I was getting but it wasn't a bad book.
4,Superior 14-0490 Load Control Springs are a Good Deal,"I bought them for my 94 Toyota 4Runner that was sagging in the rear.The brackets were too small for my OEM rear shocks.My grinder and dremel tool took care of that in about 30 minutes.After that they went on fine, and a relativly painless installation.If they would have fit straight from the box, I would have gave 5 stars.You may have to slightly modify your brackets, like it did.Other than that - They Were A GREAT VALUE for The Price !!!"
2,Not what I expected!!,"This is the first Leonard book that I have read, and it did not do much for me. I was expecting something along the lines of Hall or Hiaasen, but this did not come close. I did not care enough about any of the characters, and did not find any of them funny or interesting. I will try another Leonard novel at some point, but now I think I will check out Laurence Shames, who like Hall and Hiaasen, always makes me laugh."
2,Better have a good story before you start taking liberties...,"Elmore Leonard proves in Maximum Bob that style alone can't carry a novel. Mr. Leonard should leave these things to the likes of Cormac McCarthy and truly great writers. I'll admit that this was the first walk with Leonard I've taken and it won't be my last, but for an author to have written as many novels as Leonard has you would think story mattered a bit more. In Maximum Bob, Leonard relies too heavily on thin characters that are put into a bare bones story. I will give a cheer to the dark humor that pervades (although it could have run a bit darker for my tastes) throughout, but still the thin story has its characters little more than walking/passing through places, page to page. Perhaps age and leveling energy levels had started catching up to Mr. Leonard about the time of this novel. Contractual obligations are what they are I suppose...obligations."
1,Not exactly a spellbinder; more of a snoozer,I found Leonard's book to be uninspired and unsurprising. The character's were poorly developed; the plot was thin and transparent. The ending was predictable. Ho-hum.
4,Call it above-average Bob,"Having read 10 or so of EL's books previously, I had a pretty good idea of what to expect from this one. And it has many of the same elements which make his books so enjoyable. At the same time, there are a number of distractions which make this read a little less enjoyable than others.Leanne, Bob's wife, doesn't contribute a lot to the story, and to me, seems to detract from it. Also, maybe most noteworthy is the slowness with which the main characters act. I won't blame it on Kathy, who isn't really in a position to enforce the law, but instead on Gary, who is a strangely lethargic Leonard character. Slow to get a haircut, slow to investigate, slow to draw ...Despite these minor details, it's interesting to see where Kathy might show up in the future. She's sharp. I wouldn't recommend this as ""the"" Leonard book to read, but it's still well worth spending a day on and a lot of fun, as EL is always. What's better? Bandits, Get Shorty, among others, in my opinion."
3,Not quite to the Max,"This may be a lacklustre effort from Leonard, but lacklustre from him is damn good for anyone else. It might be the surreal elements in this one, which don't play out quite so well, and also Bob himself is not a very rounded character despite being in the title. It's not a bad book by any means, but if you're looking for a Leonard to book to start off with, choose The Switch or Swag. This is better enjoyed once you know the master's style. Recommended, but not his best."
3,minimum book ?,"My 2nd step into Elmore's world (the 1st one was Tarantino's adaptation of Jackie Brown a.k.a. Punch Creole) and it somehow felt like I already had been here before.Just like QT's movie, it is full of witty dialogues, crazy&stupid; bad guys facing heroes that are so ""Johndoesque"" it is almost boring...and that's the main issue about this book : characters lack of density, there's the good ones and the bad ones and a clear line between both - but it doesn't do much good to the novel. As a fan of James Ellroy I miss the ""dostoievskian"" approach to crime he develops in his novels, I missed his epic, bigger than life plots ; EL seems to dwell in writing Cats and Dogs stories mixed with a pinch of love story and a spoonful of craziness, a cocktail many people seem to enjoy...I don't.It's inventive, dialogues are witty, easy to read (you can skip any page of the book, you won't get lost in here) but not much more than that."
3,Good Genre Work,"Alligators in Florida novels = snakes in Indiana Jones movies. They do make you pay attention and creep the skin.Elmore Leonard has certainly written better mysteries, but I enjoyed this one well enough. A couple of the characters, particularly the judge of the title, are memorable and the rest are not entirely unidimensional, the fault I find with many crime fiction novels. Writing briefly from the perspective of an alligator has to be a first, and Leonard succeeds in making it believeable. He is ruthless about eliminating characters to scarify the plot, but he is much better at sextual tension than sex scenes, which lean toward the comic though intended to be loving.Overall, a good entertainment for a long airplane ride or a beach day."
3,"Great characters, lackluster plot","A little plot-heavy, but laced with terrific characters, this Leonard novel departs a bit by being less entertaining than his previous (or subsequent) works.The story of Bob Isom Gibbs (who likes to be called ""Big"" and whom Time Magazine named ""Maximum Bob"" for his tendency to impose maximum penalties on culprits) and his run-ins with Kathy Baker (not the actress) and a huge alligator are simply not as interesting as the plotlines of, say, Get Shorty and Out of Sight. However, Leonard--as always--is a genius at creating memorable characters. I would definitely like to know more about these people--especially Leanne, the new-agey wife of Gibbs who is also possessed by 12-year-old slave girl Wanda Grace.If you are already a Leonard fan, you'll likely enjoy this offering as well. However, do not make this your first trip to Leonard territory, as it is definitely not his best. Best to start with Rum Punch, Out of Sight, or Get Shorty and move on from there."
2,Not as good as the MARTIN BECK series,"I'm a big fan of the Martin Beck series by Per Wahloo and Maj Sjowall. Murder on the Thirty-first Floor by Per Wahloo doesn't pack a punch like the books they've written together. Sorry I can't offer a more detailed review but I read this book some time ago and just got the request to review it today.I loved all the Martin Beck books, couldn't put any one of them down until I finished reading them."
4,good option,"My son still cannot read, but he can find the pairs using the drawings in the back. I use the puzzle as if they were ""bits"", hoping that he will get the image of the word."
3,Could be Better.,"This organizer looks great, has plenty of storage space and is reasonably priced. However, I found it very difficult to find a bucket it actually fits. It appears to be made for leftover paint buckets that have a nice lip bellow the handle for the belt to fasten above. 5-gallon buckets sold at Wal-Mart, Home Depot, Lowes and Ace Hardware do NOT sell buckets with this lip, believe me I checked them all. I spent more time then I care to admit trying to fasten this organizer onto a bucket. I had to remove the handle, stretch the fastener to its limit and force it to velcro closed. After all that, it does it's job well."
4,Garden Tool belt,It was a nice gift. Very handy for the gardener who has everything. Can't ave more than one of these.
1,THE WORST!,"This gets one star only because there is not a zero star rating. My wife is an avid gardener, so I was really thrilled to find this item for her for Valentine's Day. But when she tried to attach this to the appropriately sized bucket, the strap just pulled right out at the D-ring. Upon closer inspection, we discovered that there was only one row of VERY loose stitches ""holding"" the strap in! Another piece of crap made in China--I should have known better. Then, to add insult to injury, I would have to PAY shipping to send this junk back! Do yourself a favor, spend a little more, and get something made in the USA--if that's even possible anymore!"
4,Don't dump weeds,"I love it and use this constantly. The only problem I have is when emptying weeds from the bucket. If I turn it over, all my tools fall out."
4,"Snug fit, but handy","This is perfect if you're forever leaving gardening tools scattered all over the grass, or if you like to keep your tools together in one small, tidy space.More thoughts: (1) The velcro straps loop OVER the bucket handles, else the caddy will fall off. The company apparently assumes that people have better spatial reasoning than I do (smile), so they don't give instructions. A picture posted by another reviewer was really helpful, though. Thanks! (2) It doesn't come with a bucket--you'll need to buy that. (3) The velcro strap seems a bit too small for the recommended 5 gallon bucket. It fits, but even if you pull the strap really tight, the ends barely meet. It seems like the strap should be longer, or the bucket should be a bit smaller."
4,good purchase,good purchase and handy - tool belt could be a little tighter at times - seems to come loose a bit but i like the concept and it works
1,I'm sending it back,"The photograph of this item very clearly shows that it is white or light beige, with dark green trim. I thought, great, it'll be easy to find in the yard.The caddy arrived today, and it is actually GREEN, with dark green trim.Whose idiot idea was this? Once set down in the yard and forgotten for a few minutes, or left for an hour's lunch break, I'll need a dog to find it again-- it blends right into the greenery. Nobody buys a green garden tool more than once.And a former reviewer is right-- there's too much velcro around the (important) bucket strap, and this tool will be useless in a few months, as the velcro clogs with dirt and twigs. Further, if the bucket isn't exactly the size the manufacturer had in mind, the velcro wrap won't hold.Phooey."
2,Expensive,"Purchased this product and sent to Boulder, CO. Local store, McGuckins, had same item for $14.95 which is $5.00 cheaper. Very disappointed in price."
2,Send this one back to R&D...,"It doesn't come with a bucket to wrap it around, so no big deal, eh? I've been to SEVEN stores looking for the right sized bucket...they're either too little or too big. The buckets I have looked at: 10 qt., 2 1/2 gallons, 3 gallons, and 5 gallons. All but the 5 gallon bucket are too small, and the 5 gallon bucket makes the belt loop S_T_R_E_T_C_H to barely meet the velcro attachment . And the hanging hoop lock is positioned right in the middle of nowhere, so it will attach to absolutely nothing, except the handle, which renders the belt loop/velcro enclosure useless. If you buy this thing, TAKE IT TO THE STORE WITH YOU to find a @$#% BUCKET IT WILL FIT! !!"
5,Very handy,"To go with the Fiskars Caddy, I purchased a 5 gallon bucket at Home Depot and also bought the lid from Amazon to go with the bucket: Custom LeatherCraft 1140 EasySeat Lightweight Plastic Bucket Seat for 3 1/2- 5 Gallon Buckets. I gave it to my mother and she really loves it and has received many compliments/inquires from other master gardeners. I will purchase another for myself when I have a garden."
3,Bucket organizer,I purchased the Fiskar bucket organizer for my personal backyard gardening. I would not purchase it again as there are other bucket organizers that are more effecient. I don't like the one side of the pockets that are opened at the bottom. Everything falls through and if you turn the tools upside down then the bucket handle gets in the way of the head of the tools such as the large spade and the claw. My husband is going to take it and use it for his bucket which he uses in his work truck and I found one at Lowe's that I really like.
5,Bucket Organizer,"This is a simple and functional product. It does just what it is supposed to do, and does it well. I can easily carry my biggest lopping shears, hand saw, right down to my smallest trimming and weeding implements, and the 5 gallon bucket easily supports it. Things are readily reached with the small things in slots around the outer rim."
5,Fiskars buket caddy perfect for...,Perfect for puttering around the yard and carring your tools and what around. Love it! This is a perfect gift as well for the gardeners in your life.
4,Garden Bucket Caddy,We have something very similar for our tools so I thought this was a great idea. This made a great mother's day present. The quality is good for the price. I do wish it attached to the bucket better. The velcrow strap seems to slip a bunch and you need to constantly tighten it.
5,Easy organization,I bought this organizer for a gift. Then I put it on my own list for Christmas. It is easy to install on a 5 gallon bucket and it is made from quality materials.
4,A worthy gadget,"Not one for gadgets, but I recently bought this for my wife and she loves it. What she particularly likes about it is that she can easily haul her stuff about the yard and keep everything together. A surprisingly useful purchase."
2,Much too brief,"The major part of Proverbs consists of (quite) independent maxims, many covering only one verse. The only way to comment them is to expound the full mening of each one of them, or at least write longer treatments on all of the themes. The reader wants to know fully that the single proverb implies. Any commentary achieving less that this can hardly be called good. Most commentaries do fail in this way (often due to the series' format), and are thus deficient. This goes for Murphy's commentary too. Commenting Proverbs in this way would demand many pages, but the book is 31 chapters long, you know."
5,Its all in the glue..,"Pros: Holds extremely well, quick set, easy water cleanup, the standard by which all glue is judgedCons: Don't buy too much, old glue isn't fun to work with (this is a problem with all wood glue, thus 5 stars"
1,Book for teenager,First book about ironclads. If you have some knowledge about the subject - you'll lose money as I've done.
1,Please do not buy this tape,These 2 tapes are garbage. It is basically 2 guys reporting on a variety of police encounters which have gotten physical. The kicker is that they have replaced the actual reporters voice with their own and twist every situation into a police brutality complaint...
1,Unbelievable****And NOT in a good way!!!!,"I would not normally take time to do this but I feel I should save anyone I can on this one.DONT DO IT...Step away from the VCR...I rented this movie because I was hoping to (honestly) =P see some action with Mena Suvari! Well, I was painfully disappointed!! The movie is not only poorly written and directed but the acting could probably be smelt three counties away during filming. Although I do like several of the actors, they were, by far, at their worst. The only moment in the entire movie that was worth the strain to focus your eyes, was when Joey, played by Bob Hoskins, was tied up, tortured, and ""revived"" by his wife. If you've seen it you know what I mean, if you haven't, it's not worth it!If you still feel the need to see this movie, please rent it! (And make sure you rent at least one other title to watch after you turn this one off in the first 10 minutes.)Hope this helps=)..."
1,An Embarrassment,"There is no way around the conclusion that this production was a major embarrassment to everyone associated with it and a career breaker to some.Castwise, Mena Suvari and Gabriel Mann somehow manage to maintain their dignity despite the total meltdown around them and Alexandra Wentworth actually turns in an excellent performance in one of the supporting roles. But Bob Hoskins and Robert Loggia are unbelievably awful and the rest of the cast are not much better.The concept was fairly original or at least the most extreme take on an unoriginal concept, but at the last minute it gutlessly pulls back for a lame moralistic ending.The directing, production design, and editing are all about as bad as you will find in a mainstream production. Bad enough that the movie would be a useful bad example for students in film school.Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child."
3,Not as great as no one thought would be.,"When a young beautiful woman (Mena Suvari) decides to lose her virginity in a live boardcast show in the internet. When her father (Robert Loggia)-her porno filmmaker dad decides to stop her to before she does it but a Preverted Filmmaker (Bob Hopkins) is going to direct his daughter for the show. The pair of Porn Peddlers go to war.Directed by Jean Pierre-Marois (Which he also Co-Wrote the film with Ira Israel) made a film that has some good laughs and a good premise but it has annoying performances by Loggia and Hopkins, despite a solid cast. This film has little to offer, not for all comic viewing. Grade:B-."
2,A movie with something missing.,You have a movie called American Virgin - it stars Mena Suvari and has the comical Bob Hoskins - why was I bored?It has a really good concept and the cast sounds really appealing but it was not as I expected it.Mena Suvari plays the Live Virgin who will lose her virginity on air when she hits 18. I felt that her character was dense and was not brought out enough.Bob Hoskins plays the director of Live Virgin. He has some great humour and his character is great...but there was something missing.I think there is something missing from the movie as a whole. Although there are some funny moments I felt a little uninterested as the film progressed. And then you have the big finale which is exactly as I expected...happy ever after. Why for once can't they break the rules and have a satisfying/entertaining ending?The movie is watchable and not a bad attempt at all.
4,Middle ages.. in French,"It's in French. I know.. it's kinda obvious with a name like ""Moyen Age""... but it didn't occur to me when I ordered it. I thought it was just being cutsey with the title.Anyway. If you're willing to puzzle through the French, there are some fantastic articles about the middle ages with gorgeous, glossy complementary images."
3,Something different from M. Antena,"For those of us who have been fans of Isabelle Antena for years, this anglophone CD may be a disappointment. I won't say that this is unpleasant music, but it has nothing in common with her francophone music, which tends toward jazz and/or electronica. This CD has a kind of Motown funk and pop sound, at times even a bit disco. Looking at the cover, I had expected something more like Latin jazz. All this to say, if you are a fan of this wonderful singer, you will probably prefer her ""Carpe diem"" or ""L' Alphabet du Plaisir: Best Of 1982-2005."" However, having said all this, I'm always open to hearing artists explore new areas, and this doesn't disappoint in its quality in terms of vocal quality, production, and the music itself...it's more a question of expectations."
3,too much filler,"The edits are a waste of space, and B I T C H E S in the C I T Y is kinda lame. I like the ozio remix of How Does It Make You Feel, and The Way You Look Tonight is one of my favourite Air songs. But even that song doesn't sound like its finished. I think some of these tracks would have made good b-sides to compliment singles, while sparing us of the trash and filler that takes up half the cd."
1,Boy do I hate this album,"First came the brilliant Moon Safari, then the excellent Premiers Symptomes, then the wierd but vaguely interesting Virgin Suicides. Then Air released 10,000Hz - tolerable but not very good... and now this! Yuck. This album is just terrible. Amazingly bad. Most of it is insanely repetitious and boring. That which rises above boring is downright unpleasant. I had to turn it off 3/4 of the way through because it was giving me a headache.Avoid at all costs. Dont even accept this disk for free, unless you need a coaster."
2,Very Disappointing,"I was so anxious to read this book, I am an avid reader of western historical romance. This book is very poorly written, I found myself becoming so bored, the story goes on and on. Guess I have been spoiled by the awesome books written by Rosanne Bittner. A two star rating is being generous."
4,"Good album, Bad place to start","About four or five years ago, I bought this CD. Someone had reccomended waits to me, I had read a favorable review of this one and bought it.Mistake.Don't get me wrong, it's a great album, but for people new to this artist, it is terribly jarring. When I bought this cd, I listened to it once, admired it without much liking it, and put it away for about a year. When I listened to it again, I discovered I had missed out on a few brilliant tunes.Favorites: ""Lullaby,"" one of the most beautiful and depressing tunes I have ever heard. ""Another Man's Vine,"" a great bluesy vocal on a song of infidelity. ""Coney Island Baby,"" just a great Waits love song.Again, a good album, but not for beginners. If you're just getting into Tom Waits, buy Closing Time."
2,Cookie Monster on Vox.,"Are you KIDDING ME? Cookie Monster has swallowed Tom Waits and is singing on his new album!Lyrically, Tom Waits is a master. Vocally, he has offerred up one of the most unique voices in the history of rock & roll. But seriously, on Blood Money, Tracks 1 and 5 could serve as soundtracks for Sesame Street with Waits offering up the voice for Cookie Monster!Anyone who has purchsed this CD, do yourself a favor and listen to most ANY track on this record, and you'll be swept back to a childhood memory of one of Jim Neson's finest creations! It's a guaranteed laugh!Tom - There's no way you can expect music consumers to take you seriously here, and I suggest that you put a little more effort into future efforts- or dial up PBS and the Children's Television Workshop for your next release.I can't recommend this CD at all because the vocals are laughably bad...but maybe that's the intent."
1,"Don't ""waits"" your money","I'll admit it, I'm intrigued as to how a drunken-wino lookin' guy like this manages to mumble incoherently into a mike to sesame-street like music and manage to make money off of it. I'd rather listen to pigs vomiting than spend another second in a room where this music is playing."
3,Tom Waits' Greatest Themes,"Solid CD but all of the songs are reminiscent of something else he has done before. For those seeking an introduction to his works you are better off with ""Raindogs"", ""Bone Machine"" or ""Mule Variations."" Not a bad CD but after the last one (""Mule""), I have to say I prefer Waits as a happy man pining away about how he has calmly settled into the warm waters of middle age versus another CD of him howling about the death of humanity in a sea of fire.Not a classic CD but a decent pickup in a world of N'Sync, BSB and that Spears chick."
3,Alice is better,"I truely believe they released this album the same day as Alice so we wouldnt get mad at the quality of this album. Its just not very good. In Alice, Tom sings and barks, a good mixture of both. Blood Money he just kind of barks through the lyrics, all the time. I feel it has a very unbalanced, unpolished feel, and thats saying alot since Tom Waits is at his best unpolished.Buy Alice instead, and if you wan't, journey towards this one later. I'm a big Tom Waits fan, I would have bought this album anyway, I'm glad I own it, I just wish it was better."
3,It's OK,"There are some good songs on Blood Money, but as a whole the album falls short. Waits is a talented musician but this album just isn't great. The vocals are more haphazard than usual, the lyrics are repetetive in some places and some of the songs sound similar to one another.""Everything Goes to Hell,"" ""Another Man's Vine,"" and ""God's Away on Business"" are some of the real winners here though and I'm glad I bought it just for those."
3,A Bizarre set of Performance Pieces,"This release has not grown on me the way ALICE has. The music is Waits at his absolute weirdest, and that's saying something. Likely that's enough to attract legions of fans. Truth to tell, these songs have not stayed with me as ALICE's compositions have. I find myself fast forwarding or skipping through pieces like ""Calliope"", and thematically, the whole project just comes off as soundtrack music for Charles Bukowski nightmares. A worthy project, but certainly niche music for art students.Again, the music is meant to accompany some sort of theatrical piece by Robert Wilson. Maybe in context, this would rivet me more, but on its own, a couple of times through this now over the course of the past year and I doubt that I'll listen to it again."
5,Clean air and no more fumes!,"This thing rocks. I picked one of these up to help with the fumes from solder/flux. It does a fantastic job. The air is cleaned up around my workspace right after the solder touches the iron. You can literally watch the smoke drift over to the extractor - great suction!The build quality is really impressive. It has a very sturdy metal construction. There are little things that went into it that are great additional touches, like a fuse for the power, a thick power cable, and 3 extra carbon filters. All in all, I'm very impressed with this unit."
3,It might work,"It's hard to tell but I do think it does something. I used it inside a speaker I was soldering bi-wire terminals into, and it fit nicely inside the box and sucked up the solder smoke. I'm pretty sure it reduced the amount of smoke and at the very least kept smoke from wafting up into my face while I was working. There are probably better extractors for not a lot more money but this one is well made and could do the trick for light work or tight spaces.My main concern is that the filter is a very basic and not too dense carbon/foam deal that is only about a 1/4"" thick. I can't imagine it catches more than 70-80% of the particulates in smoke, probably less. Even so, this can help direct smoke away from your face and vent into the air for a larger room filtration system to take care of."
3,It works pretty good,I bought this for work with stained glass. You need the unit to be pretty close to your work area to pull fumes (smoke). It is pretty quiet considering it is a fan. Overall I rate it as good. For this price point this is a good buy.
2,"Slow, lumbering and oh so mediocre","My favorite WWII movie of all time is Where Eagles Dare, and so I had high hopes for this movie, maybe too high... Although I found the extras interesting on this DVD, the film itself was slow moving and littered with all too few action sequences. It leaves one with the impression of a movie that cannot decide whether it wants to be an action adventure or a character driven drama and in trying to be both it falls under its own weight....I would definately recommend renting this before buying..."
3,An Average WWII Movie,"This is a pretty good film overall, but Peck doesn't seem to have his heart in it most of the time. I honestly prefer Force 10 from Navarone much more than this film."
4,"Superb cast, thrilling music equals fine entertainment...","I first saw this epic on the big screen as an 11th grader in 1961, but I have rented it a couple of times in the past ten years as well. Even better than the movie is the musical score, which was released on an LP that I wore out back in the days. As far as I can tell, this score has never been released on a CD, and that's a shame. It would be too brief to occupy a disc all by itself, but the composer has many other works which could be added to make it a good buy. As a film, ""Guns"" has a few slow spots by today's standards, and might be considered overlong, but the final effect is a satisfying thriller about a little-known episode during World War II. If you like war stories of that era, don't miss this one."
1,Reeeeeally bad transfer!,"Great movie. AWFUL TRANSFER! The sound quality is pretty good but the picture quality is deplorable. The colors and shading actually pulse! Some scenes are obviously un-restored and are full of visual noise/artifacts. Worse still is that this wasn't a schlock transfer from ""Bob's VHS to DVD and Storm Door Company"". Noooooo. This was a vaunted Superbit transfer carried out by Sony. This ripping yarn deserved much, MUCH better treatment. The clarity is not there and at the least, the images should have been stabilized. Issuing this as a ""Superbit"" is a travesty as it leads you to expect superior, near hi-def quality. Instead, it's like watching an un-restored film to VHS transfer."
4,Guns of Navarone,This movie on DVD and VHS is awesome. I purchased this movie years ago in pan and scan. It is amazing how much more movie there is to watch in the wide screen format.This WWII movie is one of the best of it's era.
4,Good war story,"This is a good WW II story. Very exciting, keeps your interest. Good acting, good story line. Love Gregory Peck and Anthony Quinn in this."
3,Movie is not complete,"Movie which i bought is not complete movie, few seens was removed from the pictures, i have original VHS Tape,"
4,Guns of Navarone,Delivered promptly and as advertised. Filled out a missing item in my collection - may be years berfore I actually view it again.
5,Great Service on Videotape,"Received my copy of the classic film, Guns of Navarone is the promised amount of time (actually, slightly earlier). It was well packed and new as advertised. Great Service!!"
3,"Its okay for that time, 1961","This was one of the best war movies around during its time. It would now be labeled slow and not much action when compared to movies after it. Like all movies, we expect the next movie of its type to be better. After 30 some years, there are better movies which knocked it down on the ratings. The movie I would have put on dvd based on a Maclean book would have been Where Eagles Dare. Guns of Navarone has an excellent story line, excellent acting. the picture is grainy, the sound is well...lets just say the best home theater system couldn't do much with it. This is another one of those example whichs show that not everything can be improved on dvd. Rent it first then decide about buying or not to buy."
5,A great wartime classic,"If you're looking for a fathers day gift, look no further. I loved this movie from being a kid, and watching every holidays it was shown.It seems hard to believe that we won't see such great actors again all in one movie. The performance of Gregory Peck is awesome truly one of his best.Buy this, grab a few beers or cokes, some chips and take that phone off the hook...relax and enjoy a real classic"
3,Spoilt,This was a excellent book aka a trifle corny but the movie was ruined by poor casting and script.If there was a officer in any of the armies of World War 11 who was a excellent mountain climber and who could fluent German and Greek plus English I'll eat my hat. Not a bad book for the fifties but nonsense now.
1,Very dated and dull,"Guns of Navarone may have been the most exciting film of its time but now it's just a dull action film, so boring I was yawning the whole way through. It's not only the fact that there's no sense of urgency in the entire situation, there's also immensely fake scenes featuring a soldier mowing down an entire German platoon with one burst of machine gun fire. Add to that about two other platoons with a grenade for each and you've solidified the film's camp value.I don't have anything against 60's films. As a matter of fact, I love a lot of films from that era (Lawrence of Arabia and Ben-Hur) and there are some very exciting action films from that decade such as Where Eagles Dare and the entertaining The Dirty Dozen. Guns of Navarone is just never as tense as the premise could have been."
3,what happened to the print or the negative,"This film is excellent howerver the picture quality is worst thanmany VHS movies I have here. the first 20 mins are terrible, colors are unstables. It a shame, and there are stating (Sony pictures) in the pamplet that this was taken by the original 35 negative. With all the respect I have for Sony as a company, I have a hard time to beleive that this 35 negative has been stored so carelessly. Something should be done for a better transfer."
3,Quality,AS the other two DVD'SI found that the quality of this DVD was darkand I had to turn up the brightness up to 100% this unusual I know that thes are old but I was a bit dissapointed.
5,A QUALITY TIMELESS MOVIE WITH TERRIFIC STORY AND ACTING,"THIS MOVIE KEEPS YOU ON THE EDGE OF YOUR SEAT FROM BEGINNING TO END. IT TAKES A WELL KNOWN BOOK BY A FAMOUS AUTHOR AND TURNS IT INTO A TERRIFIC MOVIE...WITHOUT CHANGING THE BOOK TOO MUCH. THE SUSPENSE BUILDS FROM THE OPENING SCENE. GREGORY PECK, ANTHONY QUIN AND DAVID NIVEN ARE SUPERB, BUT SO IS THE REST OF THE CAST IN ITS ENTIRETY. A GREAT FILM...TREAT YOURSELF."
1,Ominous and Rustic but Disappointing,"Mojave is filled with sad and beautiful rustic songs. Its very reminicent of old Crash Test Dummies. Superman's Song from CTD's 1st album would fit right into Mojave -- almost. Mojave feels less contrived, less hook oriented. Its soul is truer. Its dark and ominous storm clouds weighted with rain. Each song is superbly crafted. This would be the perfect album for driving along country roads at dusk. Its a puzzle why WGC chose to inlude Go Jimmy Go. On its own it's not a bad song but a rocker like that is a definite mood ruiner when listening to the whole album.Why only 1 star? I didn't like them. There's nothing wrong with them per se, it just lacks something to make them work. Maybe its the Crash Test Dummies vocals."
4,VIVA LA BAMBA,"This is one of those timeless classic movies you can watch over and over again. Brillant acting, and moving performances. This picture not just captured the life of a fallen up and coming rock star, but harnessed the love and support of latino families. Valdez not only recreated the simpler times of the american fifties, but also showcased the pitfalls and dangers of the unexploited destructive paths the rebel without cause choose. Heartwarming, historical, with enjoyable and riveting performances. It had to be in order to pull off a Filipino acting like a mexican-american in the 50's. This film will stand the test of time."
4,"The day the music died, lives here........","(Instead of reviewing a film you probably already know, I stick to DVD special features)Those Exras:Commentary: Very impressive job. TWO tracks are available, one with director and cast, one with producer and music supervisor.Making of: Fine job with everyone reflecting back, plus original on-set moments, like the dramatic image of Ritchie's real life mother and sister sitting in the crowd as the La Bamba moment is recreated on stage by Phillips.Music Videos: Would've been a sin not to include them. Not just the title diddy, but ""Lonely Teardrops"" as well.Overall: Satisfying package for fans, though some deleted scenes and outtakes would've been nice."
3,OLDE REVIEW.La Bamba,"Have seen the movie before, liked it most for it's music.Acting and plot are fair.Purchased as a gift for my grand-daughter.She likes it."
2,"""LA BAMBA"" - THE LEGEND OF RITCHIE VALENS","I LOVE THIS MOVIE...IT DOES NOT GET BORRING. BEFORE I SAW THIS MOVIE I DID NOT KNOW THE STORY OF RITCHIE, ALL I KNEW WAS HE SANG ""lA BAMBA"", AND ""DONNA"", AND WAS KILLED IN A PLANE CRASH WITH (JP RICHARDSONG)- THE BIG BOPPER, AND MY PERSANOL FAVORITE 50'S ARTIST BUDDY (CHARLES HARDIN HOLLEY) HOLLY. THIS MOVIE IS WORTH SEING OVER, AND OVER AGAIN. LOU D. PHILLIPS DOES A GREAT JOB. I ALSO RECOMEND THE FABULOUS FILM ""THE BUDDY HOLLY STOORY"" STARRING GARY BUSEY."
4,"I Would Have Loved to Give This Movie as Gifts, But","I thoroughly enjoyed the movie and the music is great. I have been putting together packages including books, videos, and tapes of Buddy Holly, Ritchie Valens, and The Big Bopper as Christmas presents for teens, and would have loved to include this video as well. However, as much as I enjoyed the movie and music I couldn't include this movie due to the profanity that is included in it. I'm sure they would have enjoyed the movie, but I would not have been comfortable in giving it to former students of mine."
5,Great Drama,"The story of Rock Legend Ricardo Valenzuela aka Ritchie Valens is portrayed in this movie. Although the lead actor Lou Diamond Phillips looks nothing like the real artist, it doesn't get in the way of the excellent story writing, directing, music soundtrack, score, and acting from all involved. I consider this movie to be a Classic with many memorable scenes and timeless quotes, ""Not My Ritchie!"". Not a dry eye in the theater, but i was only ten at the time so I had an excuse. :-)Los Lobos, a band from East Los Angeles which is prodominately mexican-american or chicano, created the great soundtract to this movie. As you progress through the movie, you have the feeling that you are in 1950's central than southern california time because of how powerful the music and singing are. All vocals sung by lead actor Phillips is really the voice of Cesar Rosas from Los Lobos.I purchased this as my first movie from Amazon to watch from my pc and xbox."
5,Great movie!,"I have loved this movie since I was a little child and it first came out. My mom said it was a favorite of mine and I happened to come across it on Amazon recently so I had to get it! It's just as good as I remember it - although I didn't recall the language, thankfully! A great performance by Lou Diamond Phillips, La Bamba really was his breakthrough.Great movie, awesome quality but unfortunately a sad but true ending!"
5,fantastic,I love this film!! after being introduced to it by my older sister i have never looked back!!! Lou diamond Phillips is amazing as Ritchie Valens and Esai Morales is equally great!!! the supporting cast helps what is already a fab film become a classic!! The soundtrack is great and the end music that they play in the final scenes makes it so emotional. The film really reminds us what a loss it is when someone as talented as Ritchie Valens was dies so young... The film has never stopped making me cry and i am sure i will continue to love this film.. it is a timeless piece which is a fitting tribute to one of Rock n Roll's finest!
4,A triumph and a legacy,"I don't recall how many times I've viewed ""La Bamba,"" or even if it's a true depiction of Valens' life, but it never fails to move me. The brilliance of the performances and direction aside, Ritchie's story, as told, the film never fails to move me and inspire respect for the pioneers of 50's rock. If you are not moved by this brilliant film and all it stand for, I can only wonder. with regret, when you, not Ritchie, died. Essential viewing, a classic -- timeless and a cinematic wonder."
5,Love this movie!,Grew up watching this movie and one of my all time favorites! I could watch it over and over again.
3,It was the late 80's! - Give it a break.,"Ok, this movie is a comedy. Not supposed to be. Grab the popcorn and get ready for some entertainment. See Morgan, Pauly and a pre-star Rob Estes. Ok, truth be told, I worked on this movie in 1988. It was my first job in Hollywood, so it will always have a place in my heart. Kirk Montgomery - Denver, CO."
3,Good movie!,This is a very entertaining movie. Phantom of the mallis a great low budget movieand I enjoyed it. If it comes out on DVD i'll buy it.
5,Great outcome,"Wonderful book arrived in a few days in perfect condition. Does not have the jacket shown on image, but is Like New."
2,Ho hum,I managed to get through this book ............. just barely. Ok for a free read - if you have nothing better.
3,Worth Watching,Last scene with Rachel Wards changing expressions and Phil Collins voice and music are the best part of the movie. I looped this and watched/listened to it several times. But you have to watch the whole movie to give that last scene its beauty.
1,one of the worst movies of all time,"I just saw this movie for the first time and all I can say is, I want those two hours of my life back. Rachel Ward's character gives new meaning to the term ""useless female"". She was great in the Thorn Birds but she acts exactly the same way here. Jeff Bridges & James Woods do ok here but they're not really likeable, and in the end, nothing seems to change much for the leads. Because of that, I don't understand why the title is ""Against All Odds""..."
2,Agaonst all Odds,"I assumed Iwas ordering a product recommended by Pastor John Hegee. However, this product, using the same title, was anything but."
2,This movie Started Good but Ended a Complete Mess !!!!,2 Good actors and a Director in the Sleepwalk mode and a Luidcrous Plot Spell DISASTER...AVOID THIS DREADFULL MESS AT ALL COSTS....ONLY THE PHIL COLLINS SONG WAS MEMORABLE !!! :(
2,JEFF IS YUMMMYYYY!!!!!!,okay this movie was pretty bad! the only good thing about it were the sex scenes. i tried really hard to follow what was going on.. but there are too many names and stuff that i dont care to watch. .. i wish they would have had more naked shots of jeff.. humph
3,Smokin' Hot Love Scenes,"From the Phil Collins title song to the soundtrack of the steamy love scenes, car racing, & playing detective, the music is the best co-star. Anytime you want to relive the feel of this movie, just pop in the soundtrack CD, especially if you're on a long drive at night - I guarantee the distance will disappear! The feel of this movie is what grabs you and keeps you on the edge of your seat. It's not gonna win any Oscars, but you'll enjoy watching it. My favorite scene is the car race on a packed city road - now that's my kind of fun!"
3,Good Weekday Watch...,"The fact that the show includes Rachel Ward should tell you to take a look. Regardless of her haircut, she was great; I prefer her with longer hair.Some of the plot/storyline is a little disjointed and hard to follow. The premise is easy enough: bummed out hero needing work and shifty buddy to provide it. Of course, hero latches onto female who happens to have history with buddy. Obvious complications ensue and the fun, as well as some confusion begins. Jeff and Jim do well, and again, there's Rachel. There are nice cars and a very much-underrated car race - that was nicely done.The scenery (not just Rachel) is great and indicative of the 80's mood.It's a good, middle of the week watch. Or, if you're in for an 80's revival, do it. And if you don't ""get"" the 80's, do something else...."
2,Not aging well,"Twenty-five years ago, this thing was a hit, I guess. It's fun to see the 35 yr old Jeff Bridges pretend to be a football player and the crazed James Woods acting crazed, even way back then. Rachel Ward has a very bad case of 80s hair. What was she thinking? The plot is some silliness about football, betting, corruption and star-crossed lovers in Cozumel and LA. You're rewarded with the theme song by Phil Collins. Now, I know what the song is about, but it's still lame."
3,Try the original!,"This remake of the noir classic ""Out of the Past"" can't stand up to the original. Though not even half as old, it already looks and feels dated - despite the location shooting you never lose the sense there's a camera crew hovering next to the actors. I like Bridges and Woods, but the original is studio Hollywood at it's shimmering best - dark, mysterious and gritty, with Mitchum and Kirk Douglas in top form, plus the astonishing Jane Greer (also in this version). That said, this does have moments and the commentary is pretty interesting."
3,Poor graphics.,Not worth the price paid due to poor graphics and video quality. This was definitely not presented in a professional manner.
1,Cover is Misleading,The children's book that is pictured isn't what I received. I also received a small paperback book that is written as a play.
5,Amazing Grace,"This is an amazing book for any child to read. I think sometimes only certain people buy books with black characters or girl characters, but this is about the possibilities in all of us and saying NO to people's preconceptions of who you are. Any child or adult will enjoy this wonderful story. It should be in every school and personal library. The characters are accessible and the illustrations are wonderful."
4,"Great photos, but only with Canon paper","Setup the printer with no problems (WinXP). Text printed fast and crisp. Printed out a photo using some Kodak Glossy Photo Paper I purchased from Sam's Club. The photos were overall dark and dull - My 2-yr old HP printer did better than that! Tried various printer settings with same result. Contacted Canon: They said that the printer driver was optimized for their paper. Finally, tried the trial Canon 4x6 Photo Paper Pro that came with printer. Excellent results; looked like a photograph. Looks like I'll have to be buying Canon paper for all my future photo printing. Would have rated this printer five stars if it had been insensitive to brands of photo papers."
2,Ink prints wet and smudges. Slows down computer. Buy Epson,I'm sorry I bought this Canon printer but positive reviews influenced me into making a bad decision. When you send something to the printer you cannot do anything with your computer until the printer starts printing...VERY annoying. I didn't see any printing as fast as the specs suggested. If you print on cheap bond the wet ink soaks into it and the type is blurry. You can't use a yellow highlighter pen or the ink smudges. Pick up the prints before they dry and it will smudge. My old Epson didn't do this and the Epson photo paper is superb...wish I bought a new Epson instead.
2,Don't be fooled by other reviews,"... I was very disappointed with the results. I ended up returning the printer after messing with is a week or so to see if I couldn't get my pictures to look better. The quality was terrible. The color wasn't very vivid and you could see the pixels (very grainy). I messed with the settings and did what the manual suggested and I still wasn't happy. Needless to say I am looking for other options. Sure it seemed like a great deal...the price was low and the reviews were good...but beware. Aside from quality, it sounded like the thing was going to break when it was getting ready to print. The only positive thing I can say about this item is that it did print fairly quickly."
1,Well-documented clogging problems,"Based on much of what I read here as well as external reviews, I purchased an S520 from Amazon a little over a year ago. The performance has been decent, but I noticed several things which quickly became annoying:1. Long cleaning cycle, which drained ink -- this occurred mainly during start ups or powering up.2. Problems with the auto power-offWorst, after a period of about one month without use, I found that the black ink printer head had clogged. The cartridges were not run dry, nor did I use anything but original Canon ink. New cartridges did nothing, nor did repeated deep cleaning. I even used alcohol and Q-tips without success. After looking on-line, I learned that this is an identified fault with this model. Am about to try my luck with Canon, but don't expect much results.Caveat emptor!"
1,Canon 520 is a terrible office printer,"I got a Canon S520 because it claimed to be faster than the HP 722C that I was using before.While the printer prints very nice photos, I found out that anything that I print pages printed with my new printer bleeds at the slightest touch of even a slightly humid finger. This was a great surprise for me as I did not have that problem with my HP printer.I contacted Canon and found them absolutely unhelpful.When Canon people say their S520 printer is a Photo Printer, they tell you the truth. It is not good for anything else."
1,Another Lemon,It worked fine initially but now it won't print at all. Seems to be related to the blank ink printer head being clogged. Tried to clean it but nothing worked. I guess you get what you pay for. I think Canon may have produced this product for obsolescense in less than a year. I won't buy another Canon product.Canon's customer support is less than zero for this product.
4,"really good but very few things that annoy me, just a few!","yea its a good printer with its good resolution and awesome ink thing. the tray is flimsy but you can put it back on but sometimes it just still falls off!! also when you turn it on it does this thing where is winds but thats ok b/c its probably cleaning the ink or something. the color photos look awesome on the sample photo papers that cannon provides!! i was like woooooa this looks like a picture from a camera. haha yep. ok go get it or another canon printer, they are good at this stuff."
2,I wish I bought an Epson instead...Wet ink smudges!!,"I was influenced by positive reviews but can only conclude those people didn't know how much better an Epson is. I have an Epson at home, and bought the Canon S520 for work...what a mistake that was! It has WET INK that must dry before you touch the print or it will smudge (you can grab Epson's right away). The data being sent to the printer stops the computer from working and if it's many pages be prepared to wait for your computer work again (My Epson doesn't do this). The print heads constantly clean themselves...wasting ink...after 100 copies of something my black ink is almost out! The wet ink soaks into bond paper resulting in blurry text, so you have to buy special paper to get decent prints (letterhead paper look terrible). I wish I bought another Epson."
1,"Prints great, but print head is major design flaw!","This is my third Canon printer in about 10 years, my first two lasted roughly 4-5 years, and when I needed a new one, Consumer Reports gave this model its top marks. After six months I started having problems with clogged print heads on color. Several deep cleanings, which deplete ink quickly, seemed to resolve this. After a year, the print head is so bad that I can only print in high quality mode. I called cannon and they expressed that the print head is designed to last 1-4 years, depending on use! When asked how much it cost for a new print head...$113.00!!!! Canon just lost a loyal customer."
1,Junk,"The paper never fed correctly. When I installed the printer, I felt that there was something not right with the print head. The print head would have to go thru a little warm up routine before each time it printed. But it printed well, printed quickly, but was noisy. So I never sent it back to the company from whom I bought it. I figured it was too much of a hassle. BIG MISTAKE!! 18 months later the black ink will not print. I have tried all the troubleshooting tricks. It needs a new print head. I know I didnt even print more than 1000 pages from this printer. The print head should have lasted a lot longer than that. I have had my old lexmark for 7 years without 1 problem."
2,thought it was good first year but im changing my mind!,I had this printer a year ago and I was really happy with it. Really happy. and i think i even did a review on some websites giving it 5 stars and etc. But now after a year im sick of this printer. when it prints the black sometimes doesn't show up and if it does its really blurry (unreliable when typing papers!). I don't know what the heck went wrong with this printer but something did. I emailed canon but no luck...they have horrible tech support. unlike sony which emails me in a day with questions about my digital camera..ahem anyway...make sure this printer works for you and make up ur mind before the warranty runs out. it stinks b/c my ran out a month ago and i can't return it. I don't know if all the canon printers are this bad but i would stay away from the S520...this truly will make me lean away from canon products in the future...
1,Complete piece of junk,"My printer worked fine for a little while, but suddenly it wouldn't print black. After blowing a bunch of money on a new ink cartridge, I found that it still didn't work, so now I have an expensive paper weight full of expensive ink. I will never buy another Canon product again."
1,Total [thievery],"If you buy this printer, you'll spend most of your time cleaning the ink jets and going to the store and buying refills. This is the worst electronic product I have ever purchased. I wish I could give it zero stars."
2,The Colt,"The acting was just OK, and I wasn't happy to see the colt's protector killed toward the end of the movie. Scenery was OK."
1,Poor movie making,"Bad acting, bad photography and bad directing make a bad movie, notwithstanding its aspirations. Even my children didn't like it. Forget it."
5,least known little good film,"never heard of this film until it was on sale. I was stricken by the subject matter, and loved the plot. Great entertainment for those seeking a little seriousness in their lives."
4,war is madness,"This movie makes it's point in a very effective eloquent way. A vulnerable colt brings out the human emotions of caring, protection and temporarily overides the combatants socially induced hatred of each other. In the last tragic scene the madness of the conflict becomes very apparent. Good acting and good script make this a wothwhile view."
2,Disappointed,"I was only able to get through half this movie.When you watch a Hallmark movie, you come to expect certain things. Not only were there numerous foul language occurances, but God's name was used in vain. Being a fan of the Civil War era, I just couldn't get into the drama in this movie. It really didn't seem realistic that in the midst of fighting for one's life, there would be a whole group of men worried about a colt instead of fighting for our country."
3,Make me tear up dispite low bugit producion,I was tempted to stop watching after 15 minutes but since I like civil war movies I stuck it out. The ending is a little bit of a tear jerker. This is not a big budget movie so cut it some slack.
1,Great movie...but foul language,"""The Colt"" is an interesting movie with good actors. It has a great story. However, I threw my copy out with the garbage, because the language was so foul. Why do movie producers insist on bad language when the story would have been great to share with my grandchildren? After previewing the movie, I found that the actors took God's name in vain, and I could not with clear conscience show this movie to my children. I will be happy to see the day when the customer who buys a movie can edit the language. Then, if we do not like the bad language we can edit those foul words out of the movie and still enjoy the movie. For anyone like myself who finds foul language offensive, they would not enjoy this movie. It needs to be made into a film again; same story and actors, but without the foul language. RB"
1,The Colt,Waste of money. Dont buy. If you want to watch this rent it from a $1.00 dvd place or machine.
4,A great suprise,"The human story of this movie is very moving. My wife who HATES war related movies felt the film was compelling. I am not sure why someone would complained about the historical protrayal of this movie. It did not try to protray any specific battles, just small unit actions. If I want a history lesson I will read my books. This was an entertaining movie done in a historial context."
3,"Values humane behavior, but heavy with suffering and death","My wife borrowed ""The Colt"" hoping that it would be about the colt. In fact, it is mainly about the human cost of the Civil War. We saw lots of danger, suffering, and death. We saw different attitudes and kinds of behavior under war conditions. The movie values compassion and kindness. It does not move us to ask whether the war was worth fighting, or whether (at least) the people who fought thought it was."
3,"OK, worth about $5","Pretty good; but lack of attention to detail has Union Cavalry insignia upside down and Confederate Lieutenant's Rank sideways; only extra is in HD 1080i, Dolby 2.0 and is non 1.78:1, ""The Colt: Youth at War""...give it a RENT, unless you're a hard core War between the States buff...there is a happy ending: the g!@ d#$%^ Yankee gets killed in the end.The Colt [Blu-ray]"
3,Good Relaxing CD!!,"This CD review is from a guitarist that hails from Boise, Idaho. Johann Helton has been playing coffee shops and night clubs in the Northwest for sometime now. His latest recording is a nice and relaxing mix of Classical, Jazz and New Age guitar. I particularly like the track, ""There's a Reason"" as it had a nice, Bossa Nova beat to it. Other tracks of note were ""Quiet Room, Gentile Rain"" with it's hint of Classical guitar and ""Moroccan Roll"" which takes the listener on a New Age, musical tour. Though a few of the tracks are repetitive in their form, the CD is still a worthwhile buy. Recommended!!"
4,Could skip the middle 2/5 of the book,"After the set-up in the intitial chapters, there isn't much development. You could skip ahead to the last two fifths and not miss much. As one other reviewer said, you can read this in an afternoon, but it is a worthwhile addition to a science fiction collection."
3,"Awesome hard-science, surprisingly empathetic characters","Been a while since I read this one, and this is the only one of Forward's novels I've read. However, his strict adherence to a 'hard science' philosophy of SF is apparent, and pulled off with amazing believability. The alien creatures in this story are entirely their own, without borrowing too heavily from our own biology and history as inspiration. I am tempted to give it 4 stars, but am sticking with 3. The story is highly readable, and short enough you could finish it in a day to absolutely make it a worthwhile addition to your collection of SF. I only found myself wanting a bit more punch and drama to the story."
3,Interesting,"A truly interesting concept and story arc; some people have criticized it for the fact that there's so little plot, but as an anthropologist I found the cultural study to be quite cool. On the down side, the characters *are* rather two dimensional, as others have noted, and in fact the appendices to the book give the whole plot twist away. I didn't look at them until after I had finished the book, but even so, I kind of had an idea where it was going.But I still liked Merlene."
4,Highly Imaginative Journey,"The story is very imaginative in its setting ( the Oort Cloud beyond the expanse of our solar system ). Although the content is almost entirely a description of an alien civilization, it is still quite absorbing. I have read a lot of science fiction, and this is definitely something different. Also, this used book arrived in good condition from the seller."
2,Have some science textbooks nearby to help you,"My science knowledge is limited, and yet I'm usually able to read and enjoy a lot of the genre. I hit a wall here, for sure. This book is all about science, with just a smattering of fiction if you look real hard. The foundation of this story is science, and without any clue to the many discussions that take place, I felt like I was definitely on the outside looking in through frosted glass. I was prepared for some technical information, having read (and greatly enjoyed) Dragon's Egg. But the strengths of that book are absent here. I'm not sure who the intended audience was for this, except to say it was not me. I felt like I must have read it by mistake when it was over."
3,Knuckles protection,"Hi Amazon friends,This is a good product to someone who is looking for knuckle protection, but in the other hand has a very poor wrist protection system.To have my full hand protected im using this glove with a underneath wrist guard ( or brace guard).Its a good product overall, but you will need a a wrist guard."
4,Great Product but may not be for continues training.,"Upon recieving the gloves I was very impressed. They fit great and are very very comfortable. I do not fight professional are anything like that, these were strictly for training...which I do a lot of. I started noticing after about the 4th use the stitching across the knuckles on the right hand was starting to fray/separate(I am right handed). After about the 6th use I can now see the gel padding inside the knuckle guard(The left hand is still holding strong). The right glove is still usable; however, I have had to cut back on my training with them...now going back and forth between these gloves and my old hand wraps. I still give these gloves a 4 star and I will be placing an order for another pair here soon. I am thinking that I got a bad glove because the left hand is still just as good as the day I got them. Hopefully the next one wont start falling apart after the 4th use."
2,TINY,WAAAAAAAAAY Too small im 14 yrs old i ordered a small and after wearing thm for 5 minutes the annoyance of them was so great i just used bear hands on my heavybag. Also after wearing them for 5 minutes they started to rip soooo... dont buy them just get cotton hand wraps or an XXXL. only redeeming quality is they protect really well.Everlast Hand Wraps
2,Nothing beats good ol' hand wraps...,"I purchased these Everlast Evergel Hand Wraps as an alternative to rolling and un-rolling hand wraps, but I learned that these do not do a very good job at providing the right support and stability needed to hit the bags or spar. I went back to using good old hand wraps to do the job. I wouldn't reccommend this item over traditional hand wraps."
2,Not useful,"Had these gloves a few years ago so the newer productions might be better. However, when I had them, the stitching came apart after only a few uses so the padding started to detach from the glove. Also, the fit was just weird since those elastic bands across the back of the hands were completely useless. I suppose they were designed so you don't hyper-extend your fist when you make poor contact. But they didn't even do that. I am going to say that the glove part itself felt fine but I can't say that softer or more comfortable material is terribly high on my list of criteria for bag gloves."
2,Not so great,"I bought these gloves for my Krav Maga class because they allow me to better grip my opponent. However, they do not protect the fingers enough and I stopped using them due to this (I was coming out of class with my hands torn and bleeding). Also the palms gave out fairly quick with little bits of material falling off all through class which I found annoying."
1,For a woman,"Reading the description makes it very clear these are good gloves, however nowhere does it specify they are for a woman. It wasn't until i realized they also sell them in pink that they are girls gloves, and naturally did not fit when they arrived."
1,Never received,"I never received these. I'm sure they are great but between the company that sold these to me, and Amazon, I got nowhere with any of them. It was like throwing $20 away just because of the frustration of not getting anywhere."
2,Knuckles take damage,"We got both these and a pair of more traditional boxing gloves to work out on our new freestanding heavy punching bag. My son tried these wraps first and got large pieces of skin scraped off his knuckles after a few minutes. He's still soaking one knuckle in epsom salts and using a topical anti-biotic because it became infected. Thinking he maybe didn't use them correctly, I tried them myself and stopped after only a short time when I noticed I was starting to lose skin on my knuckles as well. We both switched to the traditional gloves and found them just right for bag work. I suppose these wraps are good for some other purposes, or perhaps after you've developed tougher skin or calluses from use. If you ain't already experienced and toughened up, I wouldn't use these. Hope this helps."
4,Better than I expected from an everlast product.,"I have a set that are currently about to be on their last leg. So I'm getting another set. I use this for boxing, kick boxing and weightlifting. I also throw these in the washer then the dryer. These are pretty durable and do decent coverage. The smell if you don't regularly wash this get's to be crazy. My eyes watered once. These are a close second to standard hand wraps."
3,Size runs small,I usually wear a men's small and woman's medium in gloves. I thought these were men's so I bought a small. They were so tight and I had trouble removing them. They did seem to give me the wrist support I needed. I am using them for weight lifting. I am not sure if the padding is bothering me because the gloves are too small for me. I am thinking of ordering a medium or find another product. I thought $9.50 was a good price but a size medium costs about $15.82 and I am not sure I like the gloves that much.
1,Bad Quality,I used these gloves once under my boxing gloves and the gel beads started to leak. After just one use! Bad quality.
2,Way too small,They look like they would work nice for my needs but they are way too small. I got them for me to use but they won't even fit my wife who has much smaller hands than I do. For the price I paid for them it is not worth paying return shipping to get my purchase price back so I will give them to a child that can use them.
5,very nice,"These hand wraps are really nice. The hand wraps include Ever Gel which is the yellow part on the wraps that are yellow/black. Compress-X strap gives maximum support for the wrist. Ever Cool simply keeps the hand cooler than regular hand wraps. In my opinion, get these if you don't feel like wrapping a wrap around your hand every time you want to go hit the bag. I have these and i take them on and off all day because I am constantly at the boxing gym or at my house hitting the bag."
1,Worst product ever,"Cut of the circulation in a couple fingers (no, they were not too small), and came apart at the seams almost immediately."
3,Case of Mistaken Identity,"Alot of people who have written reviews, in my opinion are not realizing that these gloves are not being sold as a replacement for boxing/bag gloves.These gloves are meant to be used a quick and easy alternative for HAND WRAPS, as in that tape/ace bandage looking thing that you see boxer's on TV wrapping their hands and wrists with before putting them inside of their boxing gloves.They ARE overly tight and overly snug but that is to prevent injury to the small bones in your hand and also from spraining your wrist.Two problems, the gel is to large to fit in some boxing gloves. And the stitching is somewhat weak , and since your buying this online ... I recommend going to your local sports goods store and try on the sizes and see what is good for you, that is what I did. Also over time the gloves break in like a baseball glove and become more comfortable and less overly tight.Remember NOT A BAG GLOVE, NOT BOXING GLOVES"
2,tear away my heart,"I was so excited to receive this item. I paid for 2 day shipping. I got it and the first time I tried to put them on the mesh on the top of the glove tore at the seam. My hands are large, but not huge and these are the XL size. They don't have a larger size. The gel was nice when I was hitting the bag with them so if your hands are smaller and you won't have to work hard to put them on, it might be a nice purchase."
3,Nice gel but poor stitching,"The gel is very nice. Unfortunately these are not made normal and seem to be narrow for their size. Also, the stitching is not the best. The first time I put mine on, the stitching holding the netting on the back side of the glove, gave loose and I had to re-stitch about 1 inch of it. Not a big deal to me but they should make them strong enough that you dont have to do that. Other than that, the design is pretty cool. These are just not very well built. They are made in china so what do we expect. Should have gone for some more expensive gloves."
3,Good for what they do,Yeah these are good wraps but if you're looking for something similar to work a bag with try MMA style gloves.I repeat do NOT use these to work a heavy bag alone. They are not intended to take that kind of abuse and will fall apart without outer bag gloves.
2,Doesn't really protect your knuckles,"If using these as stand-alone MMA gloves: My knuckles would still bleed using these (and I don't punch hard at all). There's just not enough cushion with these gloves. IMO, don't waste your money with these, get the Harbingers, they cost more but they protect a lot better. I actually prefer punching without gloves or with just regular hand wraps than using these gloves.I don't understand how you can use these as wraps under boxing gloves because they're too big to fit inside gloves!"
3,My six year old couldn't even get them on her hands!,"I wear a size ladies small in the gloves at my gym so I ordered a small in these gloves. I couldn't even get them on my hands, nor could my six-year-old. Very strange. However, the company took them back and gave me a full refund."
3,Too small!!!!,"My hands are really small, and yet the small size in the gloves hurt my hands and cut off my circulation. I couldn't get the size changed despite this problem because sending them back would mean I would pay half of what they cost on shipping. I kept them and tried to stretch them and they are a little better, but they have ripped a little even though I have only used them a couple of times. Probably because they were too tight."
2,No support and already falling apart.,"I bought these to wear under my heavy gloves as a replacement for my regular wraps to make transitioning from my class's warm-up (which often includes playing catch with a medicine ball so wraps get in the way) to our heavy bag work easier. These don't hold a candle to plain old wraps that cost a heck of a lot less. They give absolutely no support to my wrists or the small bones of my hands. Just not enough material. The gel seems to me to be more ""cute"" than anything. A couple of wraps around my knuckles with my old wraps seem to offer as much if not more protection. To top it off I've been using them two or three times a week for a month and the mesh next to both thumbs has already ripped through. I guess I just need to get more efficient at wrapping my hands with traditional wraps during transitions."
2,Not Very Good,"Used these one time, and silicone gel beads were leaking out of the gloves. they fit well, and provided good cushion for your hands, but I don't know how long that will last if it is leaking after the first use."
3,small,"if the size says""small"" they aren't kidding. its so small it cannot fit the hands of my 3 year old. not sending it back for refund. its a hassle, i'll just order XL. that should be just nice. its a ""handwrap"" so its suppose to fit just nice, so XL would be fine."
2,Item different than picture/description,"The item I received was a different model then the one I thought I was getting. Which resulted in the gloves not fitting because they were too small in that particular model, while the model I ordered would have fit me perfectly (because I tried them on at a store)Other than that, the package arrived on time, and the return was easy."
5,High quality,"Being an avid amateur boxer, I was constantly plagued with sore knuckles and hands for constantly hitting the heavy bag day in and day out until I got these EverGel Hand wraps. The cushioning for the delicate bones of the hand is phenomenal. They don't offer much in the way of wrist support though, but simply wrapping the hand wraps with traditional boxing gauze fixed that problem easily. As stated in another review, these wraps are designed to be worn inside boxing gloves, not by themselves."
2,smalls are extremely small,I wish I could say that these are awesome but I couldn't even get them on. I have small hands. I am 5 4 and my pinky barley comes out of my mma gloves. I was hopng smalls would be perfect. Well these things were tiny. For a very young adult at best. O well.
4,Good to Go,"I use these WRAPS under 16oz gloves, all the time and have no issues. The problem is people are reviewing them as a replacement for bag gloves or getting the wrong size for their hands. Your best bet as I saw in another review is to try some on in the store to find out what size is good to go. These are wraps NOT gloves. If the wrist strap is not covering above your wrist it's because you have the wrong size. These are great and are easy to get on and off. The only gripe is the cross straps should have a longer piece of pile material to secured them better."
4,Awesome,Teach a cardio kick class and they work perfect.They aren't super heavy and not to bulky. Much easier than using wraps
3,Need size guide,After about 20 minutes in class the gloves begin to dig into the spaces between fingers. I had tried on a pair of small in a store and they fit okay so I thought ordering a small here would be ok but they are too small.
2,Not a case of mistaken identity,"These in fact are intended to be used as bag gloves. If it was only a quick ""wrap"", there wouldn't be any gel in the knuckles. Once your hand is in this glove, it cannot fit into a standard boxing glove.This glove has half fingers which have elastic at the ends. The elastic is so tight that it cuts off your circulation in each finger and is useless. Otherwise, this is a good glove and provides good wrist support, but will wear out quickly.I've used the Harbinger brand gloves for years, with absolutely no problems or injuries. Although Harbinger WristWrap Bag Gloves are twice the cost, the Harbinger are far superior.Harbinger 320 Bag Glove WristWrap (Black)Since these are one of the most important pieces of equipment that you will have, don't compromise."
3,"Pretty small, but get the job done",Bought for punching bag. SUPER TIGHT; they are technically the right size but cut off circulation to my fingers a bit. I am hoping to stretch them out before practice next week.
2,no good either way,these are meant to use as hand wraps but they suck when using with gloves over them. the fingers curl back and they dont function anywhere near as good as taking the time to wrap the tried and true way. as bag gloves they will tear very quickly. i wish someone had told me this info before i had purchased..they are pretty comfortable i will give them that but i have decided through my own experience this a fad item or a trend...i went back to wraps .once you get into a habit you can wrap good in a short time
2,Keep looking,Almost a good product. I had the same problem with seems coming apart. I won't spend money on Everlast products anymore.
3,Small is insanely tiny,"I got these for my wife and small is extremely small, more like fitting the hand of a ten year old girl, don't get the small unless you have super tiny hands, also product not as pictures as usually all these everlast products are, received the model with the crisscross x straps."
4,good wraps,Does the job well. Holds my hands in place and safely under boxing gloves. They dry quickly and take a beat up often while staying in one piece.
4,"Comfy, good quality","This is my second pair of EverGel Hand Wraps, but not because the first pair wore out! I lost my first pair, but because I liked them so much, had to order my second pair asap! Very comfy, good quality gloves! I use them in cardio kickboxing, and the gel gives great cushion while the cloth palms are very resistant to wear and tear (from doing strength training exercises while kickboxing). The mesh backs make them very breathable, too! I'd say I have small to medium hands, and I'm very glad I choose a size Medium glove. Try them, you'll love them!"
4,good but small,"like i said befor i have hands like bear paws,the wraps come in (s,m) (l,xl) i got the xl's, they need to make xxl. My hands fit in the xl's but they ripped in the first week, well the left one ripped the right one is perfect. They protect ur hands fairly well though, if they came in xxl i would have given them a 5 star rating."
4,Convenient wraps!,"I think the problem that I've seen other people having in the reviews of these wraps is that these wraps look an awful lot like bag gloves with wrist wraps that are offered by other companies. Even though the package clearly says that these are handwraps (and says nothing about them being bag gloves) they still look like some other bag gloves. But as others have noted, they are not.But they are a very nice set of handwraps! I used a pair of these inside a pair of Everlast bag gloves and they fit inside there perfectly and felt very comfortable and secure. And what a convenience not to have to go through the time and hassle of wrapping my hands just to get some time on the heavy bag!So, I like them. I haven't had them for long enough to speak to durability, but I'll try them for awhile and perhaps post an update."
2,They don't last long.,"When I first got these they felt great. They worked great too, but the seams on the wrist started to tear after a couple of weeks of use. I started to tape around the wrists but the fringe of the torn seams became uncomfortable. Had they been more durable I would have given them 5 stars."
3,Dont buy them,"Dont bother buying these, the seams tear WAY too easy. If you are just looking for something good loking to show off, these are it. But any serious bag work and the seams split. On the good side, these feel really nice on the hands"
3,hopefully they'll stretch?,"I had tried on the Everlast EverGel Hand Wraps in large at a Big 5 store and thought that they were too big, so I ordered the mediums; however, they feel slightly uncomfortably tight and leave my hands red and sore. :( Hopefully they'll stretch a little, but otherwise they breath well and look sexy, ha! I've hit a bag a few times with them and they haven't ripped (as other reviews I've seen for them claim). I'll throw them in the wash one of these days and hopefully that'll help break 'em in."
2,gel wraps,Well fitting if you take the advice and order a size up from what you'd normally wear-They started breaking down after the second use on a heavy bag-The low price makes them disposable however-
2,"Excellent padding, terrible stitching","Purchased these from a local sports store. Customizable fit, excellent gel protection, good wrist support... but I tore the stitching for the gel after the first few punches (against a heavy bag), tore the mesh stitching over the back of the hand after the next few... they still work, but these wraps definitely won't be Everlasting and are definitely not worth the money."
2,Maybe Tougher If They'd Been Made in Bklyn instead of China,"I am not a boxer - amateur or otherwise. I like the heavy bag for arm workouts. I used these on my 100lb. neva-tear bag, and after the second use, the spandex material is already tearing at the knuckles. The left hand thumb stitching came apart too. Don't expect to get much use out of them. Also, they don't protect the forefinger area, so punching has to be more controlled - which isn't a bad thing unless you miss - ouch! Gel area provides good cushioning, but I still had the red (bloody) areas between the bottom of my fingers - same as I get with cloth wraps. Good wrist support, and faster to put on than wraps, but at least you can wrap the areas you want with more material using traditional wraps. Not worth the price."
3,Decent alternative to wraps,"As the title says, these are a pretty decent alternative to wraps. The biggest plus is that they are super easy to take on and off -- you don't have to spend your time wrapping. However, I found that with constant use (I used them 3x a week) they start to fray pretty badly. I also found that they retain sweat and the ""glove smell"" more than wraps.So I now use them in rotation with Everlast Professional wraps, and it seems to work fine. (Or, you could just buy three or four pairs of the Gel Wraps, but that adds up.)And this may or may not be important to you (it's wasn't to me) but you will definitely get some looks at the gym, since these are not the traditional or ""old-school"" wraps. You might not get taken as seriously.In terms of care, I hand washed them in Woolite and warm water, and they usually needed a day to dry out.In terms of support/protection/cushioning, I did not notice any significant difference between the Gel Wraps and the traditional Pro Wraps."
2,"Will work, but not very durable","These are good...the fit and features were fine, as advertised. However, after a couple months of being hurled against my 100 lb bag, the gel burst through the fabric covering the knuckles, effectively leaving me without any gloves."
3,Okay if you don't hit hard...,"I use these for my kickboxing class, and as an alternative to bare hands for martial arts training. My first pair was destroyed in less than a week. My sister doesn't hit quite as intensely as I do, and after a month, hers are still in great shape - no tears or wear showing at the seams. These are designed for women, but if you don't ""hit like a girl"", they're not for you."
2,Falls apart in no time,"I bought these to replace hand wraps. They fit relatively well and are somewhat adjustable using the elastic straps that make an ""X"" on the back of the hand. However, they are made of a combination of mesh fabric, foam rubber, and leather. The foam rubber started to tear away from the mesh material in less than 4 weeks. If the gloves were made of a more durable material, they would be great. I can't recommend them given the lack of durability."
5,"Easy, Quick, Comfortable","Firstly I have to say they are called Hand Wraps, not Gloves, for a reason. People using these as gloves make up the vast majority of negative reviews, which is a shame. As Hand Wraps these are intended to be worn beneath your gloves taking place of the original hand wraps, which you actually had to wrap around your hand. They are very quick to put on, quite comfortable, and offer a stiff wrist. Having used them every three days for the past two months I have no complaints, they are starting to break down a bit, but I use them quite heavily and they are on pace to last as long as old fashion wraps. I will be buying another set, they make it easy to get in a quick heavy bag routine."
4,very good product,it is a very good product. fits and feels great. but cannot be used in conjunction with the gloves for a heavy bag.
1,Ripped after 30min,"I bought this with a Century BOB punching bag.BOB held up but the gloves did not. The material started to rip away from the stitching,Completely worthless. 30min!?!"
2,Gloves,"I was very excited about these gloves. Unfortunately, they run very small. I thought that if I wore them a few times then they would stretch out and form to fit my hand; however, they haven't and instead my hands have started to lose circulation in the middle of kick boxing class :("
2,Stick to hand wraps,"These wraps do not provide any real protection to your hands. Yes it is convenience, you can just slip them on. But I recommend sticking to hand wraps. The hand wraps will give your hands the protections they need and the proper support. This only has a gel material around the knuckles and nothing more."
1,WAY undersized....,"I specifically measured my hands before buying these gloves, as they come in many sizes and I wanted the best fit. I bought the exact size glove that fit my measurement (small), however I can barely get these on my hands, and once on they cut off the circulation to my fingers. I couldn't bear to keep them on for long enough to use them as hand wraps or gloves, so can't comment on how good they are for that."
2,Padding to little.,At first I thought its gona give protection but end up it causes too much impact on the joints knuckles.
4,LOVED IT!,"I choose this movie wanting a comedy. Although there are plenty to choose from I knew that these two actors would be hilarious & thought how can you go wrong with Comedy in New York! I imagined all the hilarious things that could happen & pushed play! I'm glad I choose it it met my expectations perfectly! There was never a dull moment, and it was soo funny yet some slight romance! I'm a recent college graduate and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good laugh! ENJOY!!!"
5,I love this movie!,I love Goldie Hawn and Steve Martin in this movie. Very funny and I will watch it again and again!
2,Ho Hum,"Fun to watch but if you have seen the first one it is not as good. If they had followed the same premises it would have been better, Goldie Hawn was great."
4,The Out of Towners,"I had seen this movie before and wanted to watch again. And I am sure again! Steve Martin and Goldie Hawn are hilarious together. The movie has a lot of great and funny scenes. If you like either of these two stars, chances are you will like it."
5,Great comedy!,"I never laughed so hard in my life! I rented this movie figuring it would be O.K. It was so funny. You know a movie is funny when you break out into uncontrollable, eye-watering laughter just remembering a scene from the film, even after you've finished watching the movie. Goldie Hawn and Steve Martin are a classic comedic duo. I would highly recommend it to anyone who wants to lift their spirits and see something lighthearted, not too serious, and hysterical."
5,nobody does absurd surprise slapstick like Steve Martin,This comedy really helped me cheer up. I was previewing it for our family and friends to watch on New Year's Eve because I didn't want a dud. I laughed so much that the cat was bewildered. I was in bed and trying not to roll on top of her because I really got the giggles and couldn't stop.New Year's Eve was a hit because everyone enjoyed the show. Adding John Cleese was like the icing on the cake.
3,"SAM WEISMAN, OPUS 4","*** 1999. Directed by Sam Weisman. When I read that the estimated budget of this film is $40,000,000, I wonder where all the money went. I suppose Steve Martin, Goldie Hawn and John Cleese were well paid but, still, I'm sure there was some money left. I really don't understand why this enhanced stage play cost so much. Anyway, my kids loved the movie, my wife and I laughed two or three times and that's about it. In short, enjoyable but already forgotten."
5,Wow,"This movie is so hilarious. It tells the story of a man who got fired but is too proud to admit that to his wife. Then the time comes for a new job interview in New York.""Journey may be more important than the destination"" is what Steve and Goldie find out on their way and during their stay in New York.A must watch movie."
3,out of towners,The out of towners wasn't as good as I expected. Thought it would have been better since it had steve and Goldie.
3,hmmm,it's humorous.. i only saw it twice once on comwedy network and then on dvd.. i'd say rent it ..
2,Mediocrity in all it's glory!,"All I can say about this movie is that it's...mediocre. It's not really funny, with a couple chuckles and smiles here and there, and the actors play characters that you can't help but hate. Steve Martin is, okay, but I've seen him in funnier roles. Goldie Hawn's character was showered with so much stupidity and idiocy that she became annoying and at times, unbearable. John Cleese dancing in drag did nothing for me, and it wasn't funny. ""The Out of Towners"" is not a terrible movie, I just didn't really care enough about it to make a real judgement. My friend liked it and bought it, so I laughed sometimes for his benefit. I thought about how much money he spent on it too, $30 to be exact, and thought that this movie didn't deserve to have that much money shelled out on it. I can't come up with a real opinion of this movie, only that it should win an award for most mediocre film of the year!"
1,Send in the Energizer Bunny,This movie is SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO STUPID!!!!! I turned it off after the first 10 minutes thinking that this movie has the same gag over and over again. I wish that they sent the Energizer bunny in.
2,Stick to the Original,"If you've seen the original ""Out-of-Towners"" with Jack Lemmon and Sandy Dennis, there's really no reason to see the remake. Jack was so funny and put everything into his performance, but this time the humor just isn't there. The story is very rushed and it hurts the movie. For example, the couple leave Ohio, get on a plane, it can't land in New York, they can't find their luggage and are rerouted to Boston all in the first 20 minutes of the movie! And they altered the story a little, which cuts even more of the humor out of it. Like, instead of the hotel giving their room away, their credit card was decined. There's just nothing funny about that. Nor do I remember their going to a group in the hotel to talk about sex in the original movie! Making a remake of this incredible movie was a mistake. Or if they did want to do it, they could've taken the time to do it right."
4,funny flick!,good movie to watch on an afternoon if you called out sick from work and need something to go in and out of nap time with!
4,A well made comedy.,"A movie like this goes a long way to show that experience counts for a lot in acting business. What would normally have been a nothing-out-of-the-ordinary funny movie is elevated to unusual height by the excellent teamplay of the two leads, Martin and Hawn and Cless as the crossdressing hotel manager. Without ever trying to steal each others show they each contribute to what must rate as one of the most hiarious movies ever made. The story itself, elderly but still youthfull couple has finally time for each other and they don't really know what to do now is even preserved throughout the movie and doesn't get lost like it usually does in comedies. And a continues flow of jokes keeps the pace to the very end."
4,Cunningham's Encyclopedia of Magical Herbs,Good referance book for finding herbs and their Magical uses. Wish it had more to it!
5,Great Book,"I have, for a long time, been using the web to find all that I wanted to know for my herbs. This can take up more time than just the planting and craft work. Now that I have this book I no longer find myself turning on the computer when I have a question. Its much better this way, I can read IN my garden! What a great thing! LOL! THIS BOOK HAS ALL YOU'LL NEED TO KNOW!"
4,Good Reference,"There is a lot of information on magickal herbs and their folklore. This is not a good book for practical herbalism at all. It's a good place for anyone just starting out in magick, studying Wicca, or starting or branch out into making your own supplies and working with herbs."
3,Herbs,"After reading some of this book,I decided,herb magic is something that takes a great deal of understanding,and should only be praticed by those that have spent a lot of time learning about herbs, as Cunninghampointed out a number of times,herb magic can be dangerous in the hands of somebody that doesnt know whattheir doing.A good book,but be sure to treat the contents with respect."
3,For Wiccan Witches - not 'all' Witches .....,"This is a very information & good book. However, as per most ""Wiccan"" books, it will ONLY inform you of the ""light"" (fluff) side of the herbs - not all uses. Magick consists of both light and dark. And, yes, I believe making dark magick too much of your knowledge/practice is a bad thing - I still strongly believe it should be included.Remember: All Wiccans are Witches - but not all Witches are Wiccans :)"
1,Not comprehensive or even enlightening,The description of this book is misleading. Anyone can find more information on the Internet about herbs than is contained in its pages. A disappointment and waste of time and money.
5,"Excellent resource for symbolism, planets, and uses of herbs","This Encyclopedia belongs on the bookshelf of anyone with an interest in Paganism, magic, or symbolism. Cunningham catalogs a huge selection of herbs, showing planetary correspondences, folklore, magical uses, and mythological references.My copy is well-worn by this point, I refer to it often!"
5,A Must Have,"I love this book, I use it over and over again, an would be lost with ot it. The majority of the book is in alphabetical order describing each plant, giving it's attributes and uses. From there it has cross referancing tables of folk and common names. There are magickal use lists as well. Finally, it is indexed at the end which is a grand help. Great addition to every witch's library."
3,Cunningham's Encyclopedia of Magical Herbs (Llewellyn's Sourcebook Series),This book was ok. It was very vague. I have gotten more information from Home Remedy Herbal books. I would love a Magical Herbal book that would give more input as to how to use the herb books in potions.
2,Fluff; no real info,"First off, I found this same book free on the web almost 5 years ago. Second, it doesn't have any specific information about herbs, their uses, their traditions, their cultures, etc. Third, if you know nothing about herbs, you might find this as a good starter book, but you can find websites with way more information."
4,Its good but...,This is a good book but he uses mostly folk tales in the descriptions. But I do like the fact that he lists if the herb is ok to ingest or not. I recommend this book but only to those interested in witchcraft.
3,Good reference,"This is a good reference for incense makers, but I find it too brief in the classification. Anyway is a very good job, so is a ""must have"" book."
2,"Pretty and nice, but insufficient","I had to add my .02 here, because I feel that this book, while pretty and nicely organized, just doesn't offer that much information. If you know enough about plants and herbs to be craving such a reference, you are unlikely to be satisfied, unless you want this book specifically to round out your Scott Cunningham collection, or add a bit of balance to a reference shelf that already has a lot more herbal/plant info. Good luck!"
5,Wonderful Encyclopedia,Scott's encyclopedia is great. I get it out from time to timeand thumb through it and read here and there. it's a well writtenbook.
4,cunningham's encyclopedia of magical herbs,"loved it, easy to read and so simple to apply in your magick rituals. recommend if you want to work with herbs. This book and hoodoo root and herb magick is all the books you will every need."
3,charismatic,"I liked this book, because of its humor and understated style. But at times, I wished it had a few more ""quaintly impossible"" spells. Who knows, I might need something to prevent sea serpent bites some day!"
3,I've seen better,I didn't care for this book because it didn't have any herbs that were common to my area in Texas. It also didn't list other herbs that I know to be common. Other than that it was great even though it didn't use real pictures but drawings instead.
2,Cunningham's Encylopedia of Magical Herbs,"I have always like scotts's work...this also was a book i bought for a class. The material is very, very good, but i was a little disappointed when i saw the book as the cover was in really bad shape...lots of ink markings on the inside and several crunched pages. I would not have rated this item due to the shape it came in but the author is one of my faves!!"
3,not a bad beginning book,This book was one of the first magickal herb books I started with and it's great for it's magickal corrispondance of the herbs. I've found many other non-magickal and magickal herb books along the way that would make great additions to this one. I wouldn't say it's the only book or need on magickal qualities of herbs but it's a good start.If your really into herbalism for more than the magickal properties then this one will fall short of your needs. I've found that I've had a combination of diffrent magickal and non magickal herbal books to get what I was looking for.
5,Briming with info!,"I would be sooo lost without this book. It truely is an Encyclopedia,A to Z. A must for anyone interested in using herbs in their magick and ritual work"
3,The index is very useful,"I was disappointed in the superficiality of the descriptions for the herbs and their uses, but the index is very useful. Folk names, common names, and Latin names are all easily found - making it much simpler to track down the plants you want at your local greenhouse."
3,Cunningham's Encyclopedia of Magical Herbs (Llewellyn's Sourcebook Series),"This is a great general book. A word to the wise. Some of the herbs that he recommends are posionous and should be not ingested. These herbs are in no way flagged in the book at all. Lily of the Valley, Mandrake, Belladonna are all dangerous and not for use without extensive research. Remember even if you see lots of food on the forest ground not all of it is safe to eat."
5,Absolutely a Must,"This is one of my favorite authors. Great for beginners. His stuff is good and so easy to use. He doesn't overpower you with mountains of information. ""Just the facts, Sir"" Great reference book."
4,Informative,"I recieved this book from a close friend and it is full of history and folklore and cute stories on the ""wives tales"" of herblisim ! Wish it was in Color !"
3,eh?,"This book, and the similar one about metals and gems, is limited in how useful it can be.I REALLY wish he'd provided info on the sources for his information about the herbs he used, because some of it seems, well, strange, compared to other works.For what it's worth, though, it is a good book for those wanting to dabble in herbalism and sympathetic magic.I'd just rather see people use good, NON-WICCAN, herb books for herbal information for healing and ceremonial magick ones for the magick...It really seems like a bit of a dabble."
4,Excellent resource!,"This book is quite an excellent resource to gather your basic herb information and effects that it can have. While it is not as detailed as other books such as Cathrine Yronwode's Herb and Root magic book, it does provide a few things here and there that are quite useful to any magical practitioner."
3,Magical Herbs,I think I was looking for something else. I enjoyed this book but feel it could be a bit more in depth in some areas. I did like it but think that some of the Herbs have a few more good qualities to be written about.
3,"Great idea, could be better..","I got this a few weeks ago.. the reason i chose it was because my baby was 2 months old and already 15lb so i figured a couple of months and she will outgrow any other swing since almost all of them take up to 25lb and that's it.. this swing is good, but it she doesn't calm down in it, she has to be already calm to sit in it and take a nap.. i think that it needs much more padding and the chair base is wooden so when she kicks sometimes she hits her feet on it and she gets cranky.. also it doens't recline.. as a seat, it could have used a vibrator.. we do use it a lot as a chair but only when she's in a good mood, if she's crying she kicks hard and that's when she hits her feet on the base and it gets worse.. I don't know if I would buy it again, I would probably skip the swing and get their bouncer that turns into a rocking chair.. I hope this helps.."
1,Motor went out.,"I bought this for my son. I thought it was a good buy and that he would use it for a long time. He is now two weeks old and the motor has gone out on the swing. That makes him mad, so I am having to replace it. Not very smart buy if you have to replace it."
3,The English-Dubbed Version,"At age 70, Fritz Lang returned to Germany after abandoning Hollywood in 1956. ""The 1,000 Eyes of Dr. Mabuse"" (1960) marked the legendary filmmaker's swan song. Despite a low budget and commercial considerations, Lang crafted an atmospheric thriller. The Mabuse sequel has its slow stretches, but the inventive assassination sequence and climactic car chase represent the director at his best. A fitting coda to Lang's career. (Please note that the Sinister Cinema DVD is the English-dubbed version in full-screen format. Unlike the original German release, this DVD includes the voice of British co-star Dawn Addams.)"
2,Once Fallen,I wish that I had rented this film. It was not at all what I expected and so I was quite disappointed.
2,Very disappointed,"This is definitely a ""B"", low budget movie. I like Ed Harris and in general I'd say the acting was pretty good but this is a very poor movie. I was duped into watching it by these ridiculously favorable reviews. In all fairness, I believe two stars is generous. Don't waste your time with this movie."
3,Ogden's Nash's hilarious poetry,"The contents are as follows; curl up and diet, the middle of the month, first families, move over, a clean conscience never relaxes, richer, miriam`s lucky day, woman pulls the wires, the introduction to dogs, the commn cold, the song of songs, splash!, fellow creatures, song for ditherers, it is indeed spinach and much more. ."
1,Victorinox Titanium-Enhanced Auto Open and Close Umbrella (Red),"Umbrella broke in no time but due to the life time warranty, I got a new one which I am suspecting will break soon as well even though I try to be gentle with it...It just cannot stand up to wind pressure as it claims."
2,Heavy duty? I don't think so,"These were advertised as heavy duty needles, one specificaly for leather, and I've already broken 3 of them. They might have been suited for cotton, lycra, something like that, but denim would be too much for them. Granted, I was working with leather, but it was very light leather, not saddle leather or anything, just suede and some upholstery."
1,I hate these needles,"Not even one star, I had to give them at least one to write this. Worst needles ever, broke my thread 10 times I could have sewed my projects better with a thorn from outside."
3,Mediocre product not for heavyduty use,"The needles are fine only because they were relatively inexpensive. But they are good only for general cotton fabrics. I tried them on denim and the needle bent out of shape. If it cannot work on denim, I wouldn't call it heavy duty really."
1,Absolute junk,"Something ""heavy duty"" should not break so easily. I broke the eyes on two needles in five minutes sewing a lightweight item. Singer should be ashamed of itself."
3,"Good selection, good price, subpar steel","My first attempt at using one of the stout-looking needles led to it bending almost in half. I bent it back (without difficulty) but haven't tried it since, and suspect it is weakened (even more than it was). Maybe it was just a fluke so I'll withhold a harsher judgment until I try them further."
3,LOW BUDGET KILLS GOOD IDEA,"Brooke (Sophie Monk) and Rhea ( Anya Lahiri) are models at a New Year's party in 1969. Brooke kills a guy by stabbing him a mere 87 times with a knitting needle (?). They take off and while in the desert, the goddess transforms them (after 40 years in the ground) into vampires who is supposed to rid the world of evil people. Brooke has other ideas.The idea is interesting, but the execution is low budget as too much of the action takes place in a desert convenience store. Sophie Monk is always good eye candy.F-bomb, girls making out, nudity (background party girls, not Sophie)"
1,AWFUL!,"A complete waste of time. This film has the worst plot ever conceived for a vampire story.I forced myself to sit through it hoping that it would get better towards the end so that I didn't feel I wasted my money on this turd,but it was bad from start to finish.-DAVE GRANT"
4,Very good,"I like it very good,just a doc. Not a show just stories of the truth not fake actors very good"
3,Gift for my hubby,"I am not sure what he thought about it, I refuse to watch this stuff. His brother & him watched it, and came away smiling, so they must have learned something!"
3,"Not Color Shown, but Nice","I was looking for a more vibrant purple, like the photo shows. But I should of known better with the actual color name of plum, because that is exactly what it is. It is a very rich deep plum color. Thank goodness I needed a rug for my bedroom, everything is plum, because I would of had to return it. It is super soft, but does shed. My 9 month old loved it, except when he slobers than there is little plum fibers all over him."
3,Prelude to Revolution.,"Many people attribute different things to the French Revolution. Ashley attributes the French Revolution to the unwise decisions of Louis XIV. Louis XIV was a smarter, more devoted King than the two who suceeded him. However, he set up the poor tax system and huge expeditures that all that promised later revolution. The tax system taxed the poor and middle class and gave a pass to the nobles and church. He also had the middle class administering his huge empire. Unwise wars made him athreat to the other states in Europe.This is an OK read about the Sun King. At a little over 130 pages, the reader should come away with a knowledge of the absolutist monarchy of France."
4,jason,Again Harryhausen's work speaks for itself. I watched this movie when I was young and still enjoy it today. It is timeless fun and adventure.
3,Times change,"This was far and away one of my favorite childhood movies. So I got this DVD with the highest hopes that my kids (ages 8 and 6) would enjoy it as much as I did. Overall they found the story entertaining but they were utterly unimpressed by these same special effects which are so memorable to most of us. The skeleton battle scene was the notable exception but its' anticlimactic end left them wondering: ""That's it?"". The bottom line is my kids have not asked to see it again.Sadly, I actually can see their point. Technology has come too far. Watching this movie now reminded me of when I was a kid watching movies from the 30's (e.g. King Kong, Flash Gordon) and thinking then how crude those special effects seemed. Since special effects were the main reason (acting or dialogue certainly aren't) for watching ""Jason and the Argonauts"", this movie has lost its' allure for me too."
3,EXPECTED MORE,"I love this show and always have. Im glad it is preserved because to me it was a classic. However, although I loved the SHOW ITSELF, the bluray version seemed somewhat grainy in places. Ah expensive disappointment. I think I would have gotten the same picutre on regular less expensive DVD. It should be at least more DYNAMIC than the origanal DVD. I just didnt see it. Some of the best shows for DYNAMIC BLURAY are Spiderman and Fantastic 4. Somehow I expected to see maybe a lil of this somewhere and as I watched I saw no wow improvements. BUT its still a great show never the less. Jason is searching for the Golden Fleece and goes to un chartered lands with giants and other hidden dangers to find it."
3,Jason,"In its day this was great stuff; now, I just want it for my library. Used to be fun to watch; now it's funny it's so old."
3,Jason and the Argonauts,This is a classic. I ordered the movie for my dad as a Christmas present and he loved it. The special effects are laughable when compared to what Hollywood can do these days but it's still a good movie with a good story line.
3,too old for blue ray,"The movie is a classic,no question there. However if you have a good blueray player like my LG,then getting this movie in blueray is a waste of money.Yes there are very few scenes where you can see the difference,but 98% of the movie in regular DVD is just perfect. Again I can't speak for other blueray players,but this LG player I have really makes all the DVD's look almost like blueray quality anyway."
5,Classroom lesson Mythology,Excellent movie! While 6th grade students enjoyed the mythology lesson they were completely spellbound by the Sci-fi effects--laughing and clapping at the skeleton battle...cheering for the winner! This from a generation that has grown up with Harry Potter and Transformers. I highly recommend this movie. It is pure entertainment and has created a new interest in my students for movies that were filmed in the 60's. Special effects are excellent!
4,It's All About the Special-Effects,"When I was a teen, this was a ""cool"" movie. The special-effects from Ray Harryhausen were were awesome to see in 1963.I don't know if Hollywood has Special-Effects Hall Of Fame but, if they had one, Harryhausen would be a charter member. He is a legend in the movie business. Who in 1963 will ever forget seeing skeletons alive and fighting back then? Not me, or my friends. It just made a lasting impression and I suspect that will always be cool even though FX has improved so much and some of Harry's stuff looks dated by now.Dated or not, some of the scenes in here still are fun to view, even though the storyline and some of the dialog is so stupid it makes me cringe.This is almost a ""cult"" movie, I suspect, by now, especially with the horrible acting in here. The acting and dialog are so bad, it's almost a comedy in parts....but who cares? We just watch for the ""effects."""
5,"'The Best movie ever,"" said Tom Hanks",The year Ray Harryhausen was given a special academy award for his years of service as an animator Tom Hanks presented the award he was quoted as saying..... The greatest movie ever made was Jason and the Argonauts!! Quite a statemnt from a two-time Oscar winner. Nuff said
4,ANOTHER HARRYHAUSEN CLASSIC! LACKLUSTER DVD TAKES IT DOWN ONE NOTCH!,"This is another fine example of the incredible body of work the Master Ray Harryhausen has to offer. The dreaded 7 headed hydra, Talos and the famous 7 skeleton sword fight are two of the many highlights in this film. Ray's work is meticulous in this awesome fantasy adventure. The DVD transfer could have been better, but there are some nice extras. I would have rated this 5 stars if this film was given the DVD release it deserves!"
4,Beware Talos!,"...and the image of that giant bronze statue of Talos coming to life is as good as i remember from childhood. this is Ray Harryhausen at his finest -- well, ok the Golden Voyage of Sinbad is really good too with the animation of Kali.i agree that the acting leaves a lot to be desired, but Harryhausen saves the day with the sequences between the Argonauts and... huge Talos, the Harpies, the Hydra and of cause the skeletons! Harryhausen's creations just convey so much character that it's at times still clearly above the CGI effects.the story line runs fairly true to the myth although abridged to fit a movie. the film quality in the DVD is good; the picture is sharp but could have been cleaner and the option to see it in widescreen really is a must.one of the bonus items is an interview of Harryhausen by John Landis which talks mostly about the effects used in the film... and is interesting but better if Landis could stop figiting.overall an excellent and thoroughly enjoyable film."
4,Jason Seeks the Golden Fleece,"The story is not as exciting as it was when I first saw it so many years ago, but still a good curl-up on the couch on a rainy or cold afternoon or evening. I like the SinBad stories a bit more."
4,Good Fun,"This movie is a classic. I love to watch it over and over. The special effects, given the time period, are very well done and you can't help but be awed by them even today. The acting was good. I was surprised by the dialogue. I was expecting, and sometimes still do expect, this to be the regular 60's silly dialogue, but it wasn't. I loved the part where Jason and his crew save the man from the harpies and his monologue before that was very well done. The sets and places they filmed were perfect for the movie.A fun family film too. I can't wait until my nephew is old enough to watch this, my niece too."
4,classic film for a classic tale,"This film is quite enjoyable. It's the right dose of mythology, action & special-effects. The special-effects are still interesting after nearly 40 yrs. I'd suspect the newer film places more emphasis on action & effects, but here they don't detract from the story. A great film to rent or own."
5,Jason and his buddies,One of Ray's better efforts in my humble opinion. The movie itself has a good storyline and the effects are as special now as they were then.
5,jason and the argonauths,"I long wated to see this movie..over 10 years. Thanks to Amazon, I now have it."
5,Love the Skeleton Soldiers!,This is a great movie for kids. I remember seeing it in a kidde's theatre when I was young and it is still cute. Now I buy it for my 6th grade Ancient Civilizations class. The story of Jason having to steal the Golden Fleece is a Greek Myth and is told through stop-motion photography. I was entranced as a little kid and still enjoy it.
5,Great Flick,"A must see classic!! Fighting skeletons, bronze statues coming to life, multi headed dragon, and Hercules too.. what's not to love."
4,Telos Still Freaked Me Out!!,"saw this favorite of mine as a kid and loved the special effects and scary adventures of Jason and his special forces crew... I was delighted to discover this thriller still able to elicit fear and apprehension! When Telos, strong valiant giant Titan gets wind of a thief, his head turns so slowly to initiate the thrill of man vs beast battle. Greek mythology elements appreciated and audience has limited moments of peace in this action packed script. The rescued Caulkis woman was truly beautiful, exotic and created a different image of beauty for that time typical of blond, fair, and delicate. The comedic actions of the Harpies, Skeleton Army, and even Hercules were a special treat. Looks like this film, genre, special effects maintains its glory and holds up to most others of its kind to this day. Big recommend!"
3,It's All Harryhausen and Herrman,"This movie is not as good as my childhood recollections. Visually, it suffers from a very unmagical TV blandness (except for Harryhausen's stop-action, which is still an f/x high bar). A lot of the acting is really appalling. Todd Armstrong plays Jason as a boring prig with tiny eyes and a voice that seems dubbed from a spaghetti western. Makes you wish they had cast someone like William Shatner (but the movie's look is already too ""Star Trek""). Herrman's score is great. But I prefer the memories..."
1,JASON AND THE ARGONAUTS BLUE WAY,POOR VIDEO TRNSATION. DON'T MAKE THE POOR CLASSIC FILM ON THE BLUE WAY VERSION IF THEIR ORINGNAL PRINT WAS NOT GOOD ENOUGH FOR THE HIGH DEFINATION.THAT MAKE THE PEOPLE NOT TO BUY THE BLUE WAY CLASSIC MOVIES ANY MORE.
5,A Blast From The Past,Very nicely restored though some shots could have been a little less grainy. Classic story which I remember seeing on B&W television in the middle 1960s. Super price for Blu-Ray. Unfortunately we're too spoiled with all the digital hi-def CGI effects but it's still amazing how they could bash together a fantasy action film back then.
5,Jason never looked this good!!,Ray Harryhausen classic given a worthy Bluray transfer.Disc impresses way beyond my expectations.Classic movie that comes alive in H Def.Excellent!!!!
5,Classic Old-time fantasy,"Just a great story with special effects wizardry (Ray Harryhausen) that even today the myth comes alive. Also Known as ""Jason and the Golden Fleece.""I remembered this from my childhood and wanted to share it with my kids. It was a big hit with both my 7 and 14 year olds even in this age of video games and Matrix/Star Wars effects.This one is better than Clash of the Titans which is also a very good film."
1,blu ray grainy buy the regular DVD,This movie is great for the story and special effects....remember this was made in 1963! The blu-ray in no better then the original DVD so save your money.
1,Buy the VHS!!!,"This film is presented in a cropped widescreen format, though it was an Academy Ratio release. The full-screen version on the flip-side is cropped down from the widescreen version, and shows less on all four sides! The VHS (or the Harryhausen-approved full-frame laserdisc) is currently the most accurately framed version of the film currently on the market. This is symptomatic of the notion that letterboxed is always better (see the DVD of Gus Van Sant's _Elephant_, which at least acknowledges that the full screen version is, in that case, the correct theatrical presentation), but this is letterboxed when it's not supposed to be! My source for this complaint is Video Watchdog, which would never advocate pan and scan, and points out that that's what this DVD *really* is."
5,ITS BLOODY BRILLIANT!!!!!!!!!!!,"THIS GAME IS THE MOST ADDICTIVE, FUNNEST AND BRUTALIST GAME I HAVE EVER PLAYED. IT HAS THE BEST STORYLINE AND GOOD GAMEPLAY AND THE LENGTH OF THIS GAME IS AMAZING! IM SORRY IF ADULTS READ THIS REVEIW BUT IF YOUR A KID AT ANY AGE IM TELLING YOU RIGHT NOW, BUY IT!!!!"
2,Manhunt...terrible,I was not satissfied with the game Manhunt because the review that was written about the product was false. the game did not work properly and lagged completely throughout the time i played it. terrible review for a terrible product.
1,didn't even work,i bought this product a couple days ago it turned on and wouldn't load past when you click play!i tryed to email the provider and got nothing back!do not buy this product it doesn't work and the seller doesn't do anything to help their customers!
5,Rockstar's original cult classic,"I remember the first time I played this game,I was blown away by the brutal nature of it.I mean,there are other games out there that are just as violent,or maybe even worse than this one,but what makes this game so violent is it could really happen.It's not what I would call ""fantasy violence"" like in MK or Splatterhouse,but it's the killing of human beings in a brutal fashion,in what could be a real kind of setting.This game has you use alot of stealth to sneak up behind gang members to pick them off one by one.There are diffrent ways to kill them.A crowbar,a plastic bag,a glass shard,a sickle and other deadly kinds of weapons.This game is NOT for children.The gameplay is great,and the music is very creepy and it adds such a great feeling to the game.The music fits in perfectly.If you've never played this before,I highly recommend it.Enjoy."
5,A Thrill To play...,"For the few that may read this review this game literally snuck up on me! It ranks high among other stealth action games. It is right there among Metal Gear, Splinter Cell, James Bond, Hitman & Tenchu in my opinion. This is another game that is great to play at night. If you don't have surround sound, play it with your head phones so you can hear everything amplified. The graphics were grimey in a good way along with the soundtrack to add to the adrenaline rush. I know that this is not everyone's type of game. There is definitely some strategy involved. There are many different ways to complete most of these levels. You have to be patient because this game does get tedious at times. These were some of the best controls I have seen in any game. I only finished with an average score on FETISH. I may try again later on HARDCORE! I will definitely try MANHUNT 2 next!"
3,"challenging, but tedious game","This game got really tedious because of the gameplay is very similar the whole game, but it is a bit hard though 2. i think this game is a bit overrated."
3,shelf decoration,"played this game once two years ago, and it has been sitting on ym shelf collecting dust ever since. i found it very boring."
5,AWESOME,"If you leave out the gore and guts u would still have an amazing game, the stealth is incredible, in my oppinion this is a truly original game and i would put it up there with final fantasy 7 in terms of how incredibly fun this game is. buy it!!!"
4,Where is Manhunt 2,"I'm not gonna write a big review because this game is in the past now but where is Manhunt 2?People complain the game play is repetitive. What game is there where the game play throughout the game is always different? People say that all you do is hide. Yeah, in real life if you're in a situation where there's 1 of you and 100 of them who want to kill you, you're gonna hide also. That's if you even still wanna live after that.They give you different weapons to sneak up and kill guys. Bats, crowbars, nail guns, glass shards, hooks, wire, and eventually shotguns. There's parts where you lure guys into the shadows and you're aiming a gun to their head. Towards the end it turns more into typical shoot outs but the game is still good enough and you have to kill that man pig. Maybe the game didn't sell well enough for a sequel, that's too bad."
5,addictive,amazing game. warning: this is a game by adults for adults!!!its not the gore or violence. its the amazing gameplay that makes this one of the most underrated games on the ps2.buy it
5,Maximum Carnage,"Manhunt is a very fun game for PS2. Don't listen to the other people who said it sucked, if you like carnage and strategy this is the game for you."
3,Hide-and-seek to the death,"More like 3.5.This is a stealth game in the Splinter Cell/Hitman tradition with urban grit and ultra-violence as the goal.If you like getting into fights head-on, this is not your game. Your character is thrust into a world where you have to sneak in the shadows, use noise distraction to attract your enemies, and come up with creative ways to finish them off to advance. One of the most graphically violent games ever, taking the blood out of the game wouldn't really begin to make this adventure more tame.The graphics are primo, the engine solid and the sound impeccable. I'd have liked more options to fight with - maybe a combo or two - but it plays pretty swell in the end. Think of it as hide-and-seek to the death. Could get a little boring for people used to the manic runnings of Vice City or any fighting game, since you really have to use strategy here to succeed, not brawn.Not even CLOSE to being for children or the faint of heart."
1,Manhunt: Hunt ROCKSTAR!,"If you are expecting something something along the lines and quality of GTA:Vice City-Forget it.I don't have a problem with a violent, adult orientated game. Hey, it can be fun to play a homicidal maniac. But this game just gets repetitive and dull. Hide in shadows... Kill. Hide. Kill. You don't even have any real combos when you do have to fight an opponent. It gets old really fast.I'm quite surprised that with the reputation that Rockstar has, they would release a game of this low quality. The graphics aren't that great, the action slow and tedious.I'm glad I got this game as a gift instead of purchased- I would have been very angry at the loss of my money. If you must know about this game, RENT BEFORE YOU BUY!!"
3,Very repetitive,"Manfunt depicts intense graphic violence, the likes of which you might expect from a slasher movie but not from your PlayStation 2. However, these grisly scenes are done up in style, as Manhunt has a real cinematic flair to it. Manhunt is seriously intense, and anyone with a stomach for the game's concept ought to find it fiendishly entertaining. Obviously, Manhunt isn't for the faint of heart. Like it or not, the game pushes the envelope of video game violence and shows you countless scenes of wholly uncensored, heavily stylized carnage."
1,just sick,"I will put it this way, this is a sick game that makes you feel like the most worthless person in the world. I have sadly played and I returned if after 30 minutes of play time. The whole games is pointless. You can find better entertainment other places. But i have to say if you are just a little interested as I was, try for yourself and make up your own mind, but just do not buy it."
3,Questionable,"The storyline to this game is good, and as people say, :It's Rockstar, they made GTA 3, and GTA VICE CITY."" But that's the problem... it's Rockstar. This company makes questionable games some times, like State of Emergency... that game was terrible, but then GTA Vice City came out and covered up for it. This game has potential, but I am not sure of the final outcome."
1,Manhunt? Talk About Brutal!,I love rockstar games like grand theft auto 3 and vice city but this is horrible. It's horrible! You're a killer on trial for execution but then you ecsape and KILL KILL KILL! This is horrible! It's like a new generation! Why did rockstar make such a game with such brutality. I mean this game could invulence kids to be serial killers when they grow up. After this it's a ok game. Fun shooting game but; darn dude way to much bloody gorey violence!
5,KILL KILL KILL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I first rented this game because it did look kind of korny.Well was I wrong.The first day I was addicted to it. 4 straight Hours of this game.I finished it about 2 months ago.Well I will just keep my mouth shut about the ending.
1,Cool Concept but poorly executed,"THis game was fun for about two hours, then it became more of the same old thing. Sneak up behind a guy, kill him and move on to the next guy who you end in the same manner. OVER AND OVER!The fighting mechanics are terrible, you are a big burly Vin Deisel look alike who has to hit the average baddie about 10 times just to knock him down,yeah right. If the fighting and combos were better and the game had more story(it technically has NO story whatsoever)I may have liked it more.Rent before you buy!"
1,THIS GAME AIN'T GOOD,"I expected a game that was challenging,gory,perverted,sick and with a very dark atmosphere that instantly draws your attention and keeps it for more than 30 minutes. Instead I got the most repetitive and boring video game ever made. And what about the gore?Well it is OK, but it is far from being the most violent or gory video game ever created. That is simply nonsense. Do not waste your money or time unless your intelligence is comparable to that of a chimp. Sorry, even a chimp would get bored."
1,the hype is all nonsense!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,all you do is hide and killone of the dumbest games out there if not stupidi have more fun sleeping than playing this garbage gamerockstar is going down hill if you ask menot even worth forty nine dollarslousy excuse for a gamei actually have used mine as a coffee saucer
1,reviewing the reviewers,What I find more disturbing than the subject of this game is the insanely bad grammar and spelling of the people who rated it the highest. There seems to be an inverse relationship between level of litereracy and the love of this game. You people need to get some balance in your lives and expect more from yourselves.
5,The Best Video Game Since Grand Theft Auto Was Born,"This is an Incredible video game. It isnt neccesarly fun, its more of a spooky/challenging game. It Takes alot of skill at other challenging games, not being afraid of scary stuff, not being afraid when you see someone being stabbed in the eye with a crobar when there not looking. If you like games such as: Backyard Wrestling, Turok Evolution, Grand Theft Auto, BloodRayne, Blade II, Clock Tower, Resident Evil, Or One Of The Best Games Ever: Mortal Kombat, Or You can just be some Hardcore Dude who loves action packed/Gore Games you will love this one. i am on the 4th level and its been a blast playing, Go Out And Buy This Game!!!!! Warning though, this game is NOT for people i would say under the age of about 15 or 16 it has bad, bad words & Tons of GORE"
2,Great Fun For 10 Minutes,"The problem with this game is it is alot of fun for the first ten minutes and than after that all u do is repeat the same murder scenarios over and over. Sitting in the shadows for 10 minutes waiting for some stupid ape of a gang member to walk away isnt my idea of fun, it is just tedious. Rent it first just in case u might feel the same way. If u dont mind repetitive killing than u will love this game."
3,do not hunt his game,"Rockstar games is really only famous for The Max Payne and GTA Serises this game does not join the list. It sucks having to hide all the time from your enemies because your enemies are so hard to beat, unless you sneek up on um and kill or if you get a gun which you dont get in like 2 hours. Manhunt features a seris of hard stunts. But i liked luring your enemies and then strike em. Of course the graphics are herific but what do u except from Rockstar games. The camera angles suck and fighting combos are worst then bad. Overall it is not a bad game but not a good game. I give 3 Stars"
1,Be careful ordering this product,"""I am pleased with the seller who credited me promptly for this product. It did not load properly and then I realized it was not rated for Windows 7. The manufacturer emailed me another version, which also did not work. The instructions were insane. Customer service was clueless. I cannot delete the software from my computer. Beware."""
4,Great for decorating cakes,I used this product to decorate cakes and spread things like chocolate and creams. It's a pretty good spatula and is thin enough to give things a nice clean even spread without taking too much off the cake. Can't compare it to other spatuals because I only have this one for spreading things.
4,Works good,Used this spatula for various cooking projects over the last few months. It works exactly as you would expect it to. It is of a reasonable build quality and has survived months of dishwasher cleaning.
3,it's just ok,I didn't really care for this. I prefer to use my plastic or silicon spatulas but that is a personal preference so all in all this is a decent product.
5,I've waited a long tome for this...,"I have wanted one of these for years. After improvising with butter knives, rubber spatulas, etc. I decided to buy myself a gift of the Wilton Angled Spatula. I love it. I have used for icing two cakes so far and it works great. The angled offset keeps my knuckles out of the frosting. It cleans up nicely also. Looking forward to years of use."
4,OK,What can you say about a apatula? It works. It appears to be well made and easily cleaned. I liked it OK.
3,"Good, but scattershot","This is certainly a good book on the development of modern artillery, yet it left me wanting more. Hogg shows a tremendous breadth of knowledge, yet this book is not comprehensive, nor systematic, but more of a good introduction to the topic. He is a great expert on military technology, and enough information is contained here to get anyone started on further reading. It would be difficult to be encyclopedic or comprehensive in the space provided; rather than to try to describe every gun and historical oddity, this book is readable and informative for the layman."
4,Better Than Sex and Fury!,"Female Yakuza Tale is the sequel of Sex and Fury in which the geisha pick-pocket, played by Reiko, is embroiled in a yakuza plot to use geisha prostitutes to smuggle drugs to China in their crotches. The conclusion features the nude swordswomen and the Japanese mafia was so bloody and perverse, it would make Tarantino look like Harold Ramis lol. Please note that like Sex and Fury, Female Yakuza Tale is not intended for children."
2,lame soft porn,"Teruo Ishii stretches the patience of his viewers again with yet another 'pinky violence' offering, continueing the tradition of bad story line, absolutely lame sword-fighting choreography and unappealing sex scenes. Yes, the tale does include women forced to smuggle drugs in their apparently gigantic private parts, but that's not enough reason to watch this. Two stars is generous. My recommendation is to buy yourself some good porn or a good samurai movie, but this combo does not work."
2,Not what I expected.,"Not only was it not what I expected, but it was rather B grade and a bit cheesy. However, if you don't have anything better to do on a Saturday rainy afternoon, or for an all night movie marathon at home, it's not a bad flick all said and done.The ending twisted a bit, and I know a lot of have said they liked it, but truth is, for me, it was quite predictable, and perhaps a bit too convenient too. I think that revealing the ulterior motive and the relationship between the two remaining at the end was more for shock value and sales than it was to further the plot, but hey, that's just an opinion.All in all, it was okay to watch at home when I had nothing better to do, but I'm glad I didn't pay to see it at a theatre. The casting was not bad, but the acting was horrible. The filming was cheap, and I was mostly disappointed."
1,Just a total failure,"I cannot believe this was actually released. This si the worst movie I have seen in a while. There is nothing funny at all in this film, and I love dark comedy. It was dark alright, but no comedy element at all.Steve Zahn is one of my favorite 'loser' characters, but here he is just a creep. Again no measurable comedic value.Save yourself some disappointment and watch something else."
3,Intriguing till the end,"There's a reason why movies like this end up in the bargain bin: bad endings. What had me hooked turned into an implausible how-could-that-possibly-happen? Too many twists = a throwaway ending.I dug Steve Zahn's performance. And Matt Dillon was in his usual form - playing a cryptic yet down-to-earth guy who loses his job. What was a fascinating character study turned into a farce, with unintentional results. Yes, there are shades of the Coen brothers, but they do this dark comedy stuff far better."
1,It doesn't get much worse than this,"Yeeeeech!I am at a loss for words after viewing this piece of refuse. Non existant story line, pointless scenes, a ""Hollywood esque"" plot twist at the end that was just absurd, I mean were the directors trying to make the worse film ever?????Seriously folks, this one is strictly for bottom feeders. What kills me is that there were actually some decent actors and actresses in this lemon, Steve Zahn in particular. This film can boast some ""A"" List actors, who seem to have made a very bad choice. Do yourself a favor, rent ""Collateral"", or ""Garden State"", and skip this dud on your next visit to BlockBuster.By the way, did I mention how bad this film is?Tallyho!"
3,not entirely bad...,Althou it holds you for a while the ending is a little wacked. The best part of the movie for any red-blooded boy will be the blonde stripper that is worth the price of admission for her lap dance...
2,1 and 1/2 stars. A bad comedy,"I saw this movie a couple weeks ago and didn't like it that much. It's a very dark comedy that I expected would be like Office Space maybe but it just wasn't good. Or funny. Sure it had a couple good ones, but mostly I didn't like it.The movie is about a man with the perfect life, a beautiful fiancee and a dream job. And then, he gets fired and everything goes down the drain. A bankrobbery and peeing on a painting as wel as a lot more occur next but the movie just never is really funny. Most of the time, the jokes were really mean and just too dark for me. They were so dark that they were rude and innapropriate. Of course like every comedy, it has some laughs but not enough as most of them just weren't funny and were too dark. I recommend not even renting it because it's hypocritical of everything and not funny. Oh, and the millions of twists at the end were pointless."
2,ZAHN IS GREAT,Steve Zahn is totally hillarious in this film. He might be the only thing good about it. His career choice will floor you.
4,Employee of the Month a funny twist with Applegate,"I must say that I didn't have high expectations for this movie, but I really thought that is was funny and worth watching in the end. The cast worked very well together. I thought that Christina Applegate was just great and the rest of the cast was wonderful! Although I really enjoyed the movie, I think it is better to go into it without knowing the plot. It makes for better watching!! Funny, entertaining movie!!!"
2,A bit bizarre yet entertaining,"This movie is quite bizarre with a ton of different twists and turns to it. Filmed out of LA, it might have that feel to it yet there was not much meaning I could take out of the movie. Most films shot in Los Angeles I enjoy very much but this one would not make the top of my list of favorites. If you enjoy strange comedy's then give it a view and see what you think.Peter J. Miller"
2,It 's OK for families at least! DVD need more features!,"This movie is OK for families because it has very little searing and other things you find in a PG-13 or R rated movie ! The DVD is OK it got both widescreen and full screen! At least you can watch the trailer or even the fractured fairy tale anytime! The movie plot itself is decent considering the people in it had to make a live action movie from a cartoon! At least fans of the original series might like it! I gave it 2 stars because I expected more features on the DVD such as other movie Fraser has starred for the studio(The Mummy),director/ actor commentary and what about a behind the scenes feature on the DVD? That's why I gave it 2 stars! So remember OK for families but parents should watch it first before the children!"
3,"Kinda Pointless, Eric Idle makes it all worthwile","Eric Idle's performance is the only thing that saves this movie. The rest of the film is a yawn till you get to Dudley's ninja training with Idle. The other good thing about this movie is that it gives us some idea of Alfred Molina's diversity as an actor, (comparing Snidley to Angel from Maverick)"
3,Fraser and Idle made a good team.,"While this movie was not the laugh-a-minute I thought it would be, I definitely enjoyed it. The scenes with Brendan Fraser and Eric Idle together were hillarious! Those scenes, plus Fraser's range of facial expressions and knack for physical comedy made it worth watching. A fun Saturday evening rental and a must purchase if you're a Brendan Fraser fan."
4,video,This is a good movie for my grandchildren. They find it entertaining and choose it fairly often. The price could have been a little cheaper.
1,The Worst 10 Movies of All Time,"PopeyeSuperman IIILethal Weapon IVDudley Do-RightPlan 9 From Outer SpaceMy Step Mother is an AlienThe League of Extraordinary GentlemenBambi/PocahontasTremors IIIAlien IVThis level of badness was best described by my friend as we watched Superman III back in high school. He said ""this movie sucks, lets go play video games."" He then threw his bucket of popcorn all over me, stood up and walked out of the theater. I, of course, followed him wondering why I hadn't thought of it first...although I wouldn't have thrown the popcorn...it was way too expensive to decorate my friend with."
1,TERRIBLE,this was the WORST movie ive EVER seen! the only reason i even gave it a star is that you cant give no stars.
3,Did Bendan Fraser really want to do this film?,"Having been a lifelong fan of the old Dudley Do-Right cartoon series (He's my hero)(I'm 43)I found Brendans' portrayal very, very labored. The expression on his face for the most part was ""do I really want to be here?"". Sarah Jessica Parker would have been my 10th choice of ladies to play the part of Nell (I guess Sex & the City is where she belongs). Also being a Python fan, the inclusion of Eric Idle originally got my interest up....but sadly the role given him was a complete misuse of his comic genius....he would have been better suited as Snidley. The movie overall was somewhat enjoyable to watch, but I think I'll stick to watching the old cartoon series."
2,Dumb & Stupid,"Brendon Fraser is wasted in thisreally stupid movie. Although DVD quality is excellent(beautiful scenes of British Columbia - crystal clear print), plot is non-existent. However, Brendon does look good in mountie uniform & There are a couple of good dance number's - but it's not enough - BIG, BIG DISAPPOINTMENT."
4,Actually Really Good!,"I must say, after reading some of the other reviews about this movie, i was a little skeptical of how good it actually was going to be. Im a big fan of Haggard, and i didnt expect much from Minghags because of what alot of people had told me. But, staying true to the crew, i bought the movie on the fact that i think they are amazing, and im a big fan. I was very pleased when i saw the movie, I really like it, but i think you have to be a big fan of Bam and his work. Its a great film, and i love the behind the scenes, the making of, and also the Dreamseller mini-series. This DVD does, however, lack one vital thing that keeps Bam's work alive and hilarious. Raab."
1,What did I buy,"Horrible movie. Story and acting are worse than home movies and can get very annoying at times. Unlike Haggard, CKY, or Jackass. Just a horrible movie all around. No bright spots."
2,It's an okay movie,"This movie was just okay. I spent alot of money on it but I saw Ryan Dunn running around with see-through boxers and shirtless, I would pay that much again for it because he is GORGEOUS!"
2,Ehh...,"I have been a fan of the CKY Crew since the first, and I feel this is a step in the wrong direct. I loved Haggard, the first ""feature"" film the crew did...and Minghags missed that mark. Brandon played some good/funny parts, Bam was just Bam...hes not even good at playing himself. The worst part was the distinct lack of Raab. If your an avid fan and you have everything in the series, buy it, if your just getting in get the CKY series/ Haggard instead."
2,They need to stick to what they're good at,"This movie was terrible. I thought Haggard was bad and then I saw this piece of garbage. I love Bam, Bran, Ryan and Raab but they really need to stick to what they're good at which is making CKY movies. These pathetic attempts at screenplays are just embarrassing. Bran's character is annoying as hell in this movie and didn't make me laugh once. The Ralph character was equally as annoying and equally as unfunny. The acting was terrible the plot was terrible the movie was just all around terrible. I won't be watching any more movies by Bam until they get back to the prank/stunt/skateboarding movies because they are going downhill fast right now."
3,My opinion.. ?,"This movie I just had to have, and thats why i'm kind'a disappointed that one of the dvd's was laying loose in the cassette and now because of that, the dvd with the movie has alot of scratches...the movie can still be watched without any problems, but I got a little bummed out when I saw what had happended to the disc...Anyway, it was delivered fast..and thats the only good thing I have to say about this purchase"
1,worst movie ever made!!!!!!!!!!!,"I have been waiting for this movie to come out for about 3 years now, I was a huge fan of Haggard and I was so excited I pre-ordered it thinking it would be the greatest thing ever, well I was completely wrong, now I am scarred for life and very sad, I wish I had my $20 back so I could do something better with the money like set it on fire! Because that would be much more entertaining than this movie....."
5,I loved the Power Tips,The part I most enjoyed in this book were its power tips. They are in sidebars in every chapter. There must be at least eighty and they offer excellent tips. You can just glance through the sidebars and get a wealth of information. All around excellent book. I give it 5 stars.
5,Great book,POWER GOLF FOR WOMEN is a perfect follow-up to GOLF IS A WOMAN'S GAME. If you liked GOLF IS A WOMAN'S GAME you will love this book!!
5,Great!,I bought this as a gift for my mom. She loves it. She says there are lots of helpful tips that are geared towards helping women improve their game.
5,Good golf instruction.,"I liked the techniques on how to hit the ball longer. It helped me add some yardage to my drives. Another book that I also love is the following:The Ultimate Golf Instruction Guide: Key Techniques for Becoming a Zero Handicap Golfer or Better (isbn;1933023090)This second book helped me so much with hitting the ball with more control with driver, short irons, long irons and the short game. Since using this book, I lowered my handicap about 8 strokes. I now can score in the low 80's with ease. At the rate I'm improving, I know its possible for me to be a scratch golfer by using the techniques from The Ultimate Golf Instruction Guide. Power Golf for Women taught me how to hit the ball longer. The Ultimate Golf Instruction Guide taught me how to hit the ball at any target I choose with a much higher degree of accuracy."
4,Power Golf for Women,Excellent book on how to get more power in your swing for hitting great golf shots. Many diagram and suggestions to help hitting the ball longer and straighter.
5,steel magnolias,"Fantastic service. The movie was in great shape, I have watched it and laughed and cried at the same time."
2,Irritating.,"It is probably a good thing that this movie is old and everyone is done watching it. I am very surprised that they remade it in later years. The only reason this video did not get 1 star was because of Dolly Parton and Sally Field. Julia Roberts was way too old to play the roll of a daughter about to get married, and the story did not flow in a smooth pattern."
4,Southen style,Steel Magnolias is the old south no longer there. These women were typical southern belles who love each other and bond as a community. This is a great movie for families but PG
5,Simply the best!,"This is one of the best movies ever. What a cast and what great lines! This is a movie well worth watching again and again. It's a great story about love, family, friends... and life. It will make you laugh and it will most certainly make you cry."
3,"fun, escapist and undemanding entertainment","This is essentially a two-hour chance for each actress to display her acting chops. All of them do very well, especially Roberts and Fields (who gets a dramatic monologue in the middle of the film that practically screams ""Oscar""). Dukasis and McClaine have very good chemistry together, and Dolly Parton prooves that singing isn't her only talent. The only minor glitch in this movie is Darryl Hannah, who by herself, isn't terrible, but when sharing the screen with such charismatic performers, seems to shrink into mediocrity. This a slick, formulaic dramedy that does work."
4,An Amazing Movie-Julia Robert's Best,"This is a sad movie with a kinda obvious ending, but the movie is so charming that you don't think about that until the end. So many people have said Julia Robert's best movie was Pretty Woman or Erin Brockovich, but I think it was this one. She played her part so well, she was so believable. The scene in the barbor shop where she has an attack is a little sad, but so well-acted[don't worry, that's not the ending]. Everyone else did great also, especially Sally Field."
5,outstanding,With the experience of my own Dad being on life support and also having kidney failure I can truely relate to this movie. It is the best movie that I have ever and probably will ever watch. I truely urge you to watch this movie. It will bring tears to your eyes and a smile on your heart!Watch it!
1,The appeal escapes me,"Hey i'm a guy. And guess what... I loved Thelma and Louise, A Leaugue of their own, The Color Purple, Somewhere in Time... and I could go on but why.I saw absolutely nothing and I do mean nothing special about this film. I just don't get it."
1,Totally trite and manipulated,"This movie really borders on absurd. The play was simple, heart-felt and centered more on the goings on in the beauty salon. This movie is so overproduced that it diminishes the story and the performances. Sally Field gives a credible performance. Shirley McLaine and Olympia Dukakis play their characters like a cartoon. And Dolly Parton proves she is really sweet but can't act her way out of a paper bag. As for Julia Roberts...well she has screen presence, but she just can't act. Forget this super-size cotton candy film."
2,Steele Magnolias,"I would have rated this item 5 stars if the seller had mailed it in a DVD case. The seller mailed it in a regular white envelope. I contacted the seller, and voiced my displeasure in him/her mailing the DVD without putting it in a case, and the seller apologized and offered me a refund if I didn't want to keep it. I decided not to send it back because of having to pay additional postage, it just wasen't worth it. The seller should have stated that the DVD did not have a case, and should have reduced the selling price."
5,Classic Movie,"This movie stars Sally Field, Dolly Parton, Shirley MacLaine, Julia Roberts, Daryl Hannah, Olympia Dukakis, Tom Skerritt, and Dylan McDermott. An all star cast. Yes the movie mirrors 1983's TERMS OF ENDEARMENT quite a bit, but this movie works with the star studded cast who all turn in worthy performances of Oscar's. It's such a special movie about love and friendship between these women, and the ties that bind them together. Roberts' character suffers from diabetes and has a child against her doctors orders. Her character needs a kidney transplant and her on screen mom played by Sally Field, gives her kidney. However the kidney is rejected and ultimately Roberts' character dies. Truly tugs at the heartstrings and Field gives a demanding performance with her outburst at the end after the funeral. Parton, Hannah, MacLaine and Dukakis turn in comical performances that make you smile and warms your heart. Overall truly a beautiful movie that I do consider a classic."
5,I'm a man and not afraid to cry!!,"I have seen this movie many times. And each time I have seen something new. The 6 actresses in this movie are by far the best ensemble cast ever assembeled. Each has brought to their role, a uniqueness, that adds so much to the film. The male charecters, are sort of blah, but men are getting a taste of their own medicine of being the one thing the world revolves around. Women finally have a film to be proud to see. Doing and saying things with out having a male presence around. There were a lot of great one liner scenes, too many to even mention. But each time I have seen it, I have cried at the sad parts, laughed at the funny parts, and just plain felt good, when it was time to. I would recommend this film to both sexes. The males out there should not be afraid to see it. ENJOY IT!!!"
5,Classic,"One of the most heart-wrenching movies that shoes the true power of love and friendship. ""Shelby, open your eyes!"""
5,Steel Magnolias....awsome!!!,"Love this movie! A ""chick flick"" is you need to label it...but awsome movie!!"
5,one of my favorite movie,"dated, but stil a great chic flic to watch with your girlfriends on a chilly winter night. Makes you laugh and it makes you cry. the best kind of movie."
1,Steel Magnolia DVD Quality Terrible,We actually returned one of these DVDs for a replacement. The second was no better than the first. The volume quality was so poor that we had to keep the volume control on high to just barely hear the sound. Video quality was also poor.
4,All time Favorite,"Never fails... as many times that I have watched this movie, I always cry at some point. The friendship these ladies share and the southern ambiance is great!"
5,It's incredibly funny.,"Enjoyed reading and seeing places that I went to while working in Natchitoches, Louisana. Great performances by all these well-known actors."
2,"fantastic movie, bad perches","i was so excited when i ordered this movie, i was raised on it, and hadn't seen it in over 5 years. i got it and it wouldn't play on anything i put it in.... it was a major let down. maybe its just me and my players, and would work fine else where, but it didn't work for me."
5,Steel Magnolias Movie,Classic movie - great lines and many famous actors and actresses- Oliva dukacus is very good and so is McClaine
4,Steel Magnolias,This movie is tender and funny. The cast was superb. This movie will steel you heart. A thumb's up!
5,BEST MOVIE WITH JULIA ROBERTS & DOLLY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,This is my favorite movie that has Dolly and Julia. I love Julia and Dolly both - but to have them together in one is even better! I also love Sally Field - second best actress. I am speechless. ALl I have to say is this is the most wonderful review ever.
1,Steel Magnolias - Region 2 can't be played in USA,"Guess I didn't read the ""small print"" and see that this DVD will not play in USA DVD's. So disappointed as I was looking forward to watching it."
2,poor !!!!!!!!!!!,never recived my DVD but did recieve reund was dissapointed wanted the movie real bad
5,These Women Have Got What It Takes!,"Everytime I watch this movie I go through about a third of a box of tissue! Julia Roberts does an excellent job playing Shelby who suffers from a serious form of diabetes. Not just any actress can pull that off. Also the chemistry between the six actresses is superb. I'm just ""tickled pink!"""
4,Fun flick....but what was the POINT of this movie???,"I enjoyed the banter between the gals just as much as the other reviewers here. This the four stars.BUT...stop and think: In my gut I believe the director was trying to portray Julia Robert's character as sympathetic/tragic.The real tragedy was the fallout as a result of a selfish decision to go againt common sense and medical advice and have a baby.So, at the end of the film, despite all the pretty flowers and softly filmed sunshine in the park we've got the following: a young man who is now a widower, a family devistated by their unnecessary loss (despite BEGGING her not to get pregnant), and a child who has no mommy.Remember, this was all the result of her choices. Chillingly, this is a real life story.Now THAT brings a tear to my eye!"
5,Everybody loves this humorous heart-jerker.,A true American original about Southern folk and how they react to both the good times and the bad. An excellent cast!
4,Laughter and Tears,A wonderful movie i have watched over and over through the years. I didn't care for it much when i saw it in the theater. But i gave it another chance a couple ofyears later and have loved it ever since! Worth a couple of viewings then decide for yourself! I went where they filmed this movie in Louisiana and it portrays southern life very well in both Lousisana and Texas and all the other southern states.
4,Interesting and fun!,"This movie is very unique, but quite enjoyable. It's a story of lonely people coming together, helping and using each other. Interesting plot twists and great acting!"
5,Honest Author... Satisfying Read!,"I believe Timothy George offers the student of church history a great concise overview of the theology of the reformers. His presentation is honest and it calls his readers to learn from history.I appreciated his clear and forthright view of the Anabaptist tradition that too often is misrepresented. I especially liked the last chapter of the book. I believe the ""mainline reformers"" have only given us a ""half-way reformation."" To be Protestant is still in many ways to be Roman Catholic... only reformed to reflect Luther, Zwingli, and Calvin thought.George brings it all together in the last chapter and beckons the reader to examine their own theology. I believe he is right on when he says, ""We have much to learn from each of these traditions, but we are bound to none of them. We are only bound to Jesus Christ."" Bravo Mr. George! Bravo!"
4,Requires patience!,"this greek temple was alot of fun to do! I made it for my sister who teaches 3rd grade and has a unit on Greece and Rome. This is just perfect for the kids to look at while learning about the ancient civilization. The modle takes patience to make, especially all the little pillars. But the end result is so neat!"
5,I Love It.........,I like this model temple it is fun to build. We had to use a hot glue gun to glue the columns on. There is lots of scoring and folding to do on this model. I can't wait to see what it looks like when it is finished.
1,Everlast Soft Flex Water Bag,"Don't waste your time with this bag if you are serious about a workout and want something that will last. I have busted two of them inside of six months. The first lasted about four months. Everlast sent a replacement after I complained and it lasted two months before it sprang a leak in the side. Also, the bag will bulge in the side and at the bottom. Finally the top of the bag seems to collapse after some use and forms and uneven surface that is difficult to hit without injuring your hand or foot. All around a bad design and dose nothing for the fine name of Everlast."
1,Lopsided and inconsistent surface!!,I chose this bag as replacement to a leaking Century water/air bag that I loved (4+ years old). The foam padding does not provide the needed stability around the water core causing the bag to bend on itself. The result is an inconsistent and awkward punching surface.
4,Great work out bag / no longer available,"So this bag was a great buy...until the inner tube broke and I found out it is no longer available. So I stuffed the bag with old clothes and sand bags. The quality of the product was excellent. The bag broke due to cold weather, so don't forget to bring the bag in during the winter :( Contacting Everlast has not been succesful yet to get a new inner tube."
1,do not buy,"In theory this should be a reasonable piece of equipment. Unfortunately, the weight of the water will cause a teardrop effect on the bag, creating a problem finding the ""sweet spot"" of the bag. Furthermore, the teardrop deforms the inner lining and outside of the bag. Lastly, I don't consider myself a heavyweight by any means, but after 2 months, my bag's bladder started to leak...and that was it. Now tell me, what good is a heavy bag that lasts just a short time and is the product of faulty design?"
2,DONT BOTHER,Not worth it!!! The top of the bag will cave in after the first few uses. Even though tis happened I still thought it was an ok bag for awhile. The water minimizes the movement of the bag (moves like a heavier bag). The problen was I had only used the bag 3 times a week for 4 months before it sprang a leak all over my floor. Im not even a heavy guy I walk around at 150 lbs. It would be a good bag if it would of lasted.
3,decent,"the shape of the bag became a little uneven after filling it with water, but the quality appears to be decent."
3,ho hum,"the song i was looking for that is in the movie was not on this soundtrack cd, but i later found it on youtube and downloaded it to my computer. still, it's a good one for my collection"
3,*This* was a soundtrack?,"The movie was charming and we so enjoyed the mix of old and new music. The end film/music credits made me look forward to buying our copy, but then... Barely a nod of acknowledgement to the old songs. Boo. Give the whole film's recordings on a soundtrack, please, all at the same time, in a double CD album, if necessary. But don't make me wait and hope that, maybe, you'll bring out Blast, Part II, when it's too late to include the real order of the music (thereby getting a chance to relish the film, mentally, once again). It's the juxtaposition of the music, matching the viewing experience, that's so important."
5,Awesome CD,"This CD was very good,it had a variety of music and was upbeat.I recommand this CD to others.:)"
2,Correct Song,"The song several people have mentioned is by Dean Martin not Perry Como. The name of the song is ""You Belong to Me"". It's a shame it was left off the CD. BTW....this song has been covered by quite a few artists. Patsy Cline does it nicely.Love the big band music."
3,"He's Cute, But Little Ones Might Have Trouble Tickling Him","This is a cute little Curious George plush toy, but my daughter has trouble making him laugh under his arms like the box says. You have to press hard and often before you finally hit a spot that makes him laugh. His feet are the easiest parts to tickle, followed distantly by under his chin.He is a cute toy, and it is especially funny when you hit the ""wiggle"" spot which makes him shake and laugh with joy.Though I wouldn't recommend him for children under three, he's the perfect gift for kids who understand how to make him laugh in every spot he's supposed to."
1,WARNING!!! DANGER!!! CHOKING HAZARD!!!,WARNING!!!! I purchased this toy for my child and the button on his back side came off very easily and my 1 year old was ready to put it in his mouth. I have contacted Marvel and told about the problem. The toy is very cute but I warn parents of purchasing this for a young child. My 4 year old still puts stuff in his mouth. This button is just the right size for a baby or young child to choke on.
3,Cute but hard to work,This doll is cute but hard to get to laugh in my opinion and even harder for a child. It is pretty good when you do get it to laugh but it's sort of work. It didn't hold my kid's attention very long.
3,Didn't hold my son's interest,"My son LOVES Curious George, but this doll just didn't hold his interest. He liked it, but got bored fairly easily. I thought it was funny and it cracked me up!"
2,Disappointing; Tickle but no wiggle,"I bought this toy for my five year old daughter's birthday because she's on a bog C.G. kick. The toy itself is cute and and soft, and mildly cuddly. However, the package states the C.G. ""giggles and wiggles..."". After replacing the defunct batteries that ""were included"", I did eventually make George giggle, but could not make him wiggle short of shaking him myself. I was tempted to keep him anyway because he did giggle and laugh, but not by tickling his underarms and feet, etc; to produce C.G.'s laughter, you have to locate and compress the trigger points in each ""tickle spot""... a bit like a massage therapist would do, but only you have to do it with so much force you'd think you were trying to HURT C.G rather than give him a little tickle. It should be re-marketed as pressure point George. It's no wonder he was on clearance."
3,Easy to enjoy but hard to tickle...,"I recently purchased and received a Curious George Tickle `N Giggle from Amazon,its a very cute plush toy and has a silly/funny laugh when you tickle him in certain spots....only problem is that its sometimes kind of hard to tickle him. When I tested him out I thought he was broken! I had to really dig in when I tickled him(almost like a hard rub as apposed to a tickle) but he was still worth the price. My suggestion is that unless you really like/love Curious George or monkeys you shouldn't buy him, go with a tickle me Elmo."
1,Barber Of Siberia,"Was not able to transfer to be able to watch in US.There is a coding that no video store could unlock.Waste of my money, can not even return since its open.??????????"
2,Poor picture quailty.,"I purchased CLOSE ENCOUNTERS when the DVD first went on sale and was very disappointed with the picture quality. The night scenes - of which there are quite a few in this film - display very uneven levels of ""blackness"", resulting in a splotchy effect that is very distracting and detracts from the viewing experience. Playing the same discs on a different DVD player and television produced the same results. I can only assume that mine is not the only CLOSE ENCOUNTERS DVD with this flaw, and I am surprised that the quality control folks at Columbia Pictures did not catch this problem and correct it before shipping the product. I contacted Columbia weeks ago, but have not received a reply."
2,Dullish but sporadically entertaining,"This is a film that has gained a huge reputation as a timeless classic. Why? It drags, the main character cheats on his wife, aliens who are first shown as mean are really nice, a guy with wife and kids goes with some of the cheapest, ugliest aliens ever shown. It does not deserve the praise it gets. Attention CEOT3K fans: watch this again, and think about it."
4,Excellent Reproduction (Blu-Ray),"I remember seeing movie when I was 13, and was just floored at the special effects, and the story. Then in 1980, they came out with the ""Special Edition"", the version where they show show the inside of the Mother Ship, and I thought, ""that was total crap!"" Never really looked for the original version, but I remember the S.E. was about the only one out on VHS.Watched the Blu-Ray Original version last night, and all I can say is WOW. Excellent picture, excellent sound, and excellent memories. If you enjoyed this movie when it first came out, then please purchase this edition, you""ll be happy you did."
5,Close Encounters of the Third Kind - 30th Anniversary DVD,Excellent product. Superior sound and video quality. All three versions of DVD included in the same pack which is quite impressive. Packing is quite simple and very good. Delivered in right time as committed and a must for any DVD collector. Dont miss this..Cheers!!
2,highly boring,"this is a completely boring film and one of Spielberg's worst films. Usually his movies are fantastic, like Indiana Jones, Jurassic Park, or even E.T., but this so damn slow and plodding! And this is coming from someone who loved Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey! Trust me, this movie is worthless, watch it only if you want to fall asleep in front of the TV."
1,Not nearly as good as it was when I was kid,"I was sorely disappointed with this movie. I loved it when I was a kid, but after watching it for the first time since it was in theatres, I just wasn't impressed at all. I saw the DVD and couldn't resist, but I wish I would have. This has got to be one of the slowest movies I've ever seen. Spielberg never has been too impressive in my opinion, but this is pathetic. At least Jaws and E.T. have some action throughout the entire movie. Here you get a small glimpse of the alien happenings at the beginning, 1.25 hours of boredom, and an ending that just wasn't nearly as good as it was when I was kid. My kids couldn't stand it, so it's obviously not a timeless classic, like the other space/alien movies of the late 70s early 80s."
4,Close Encounters,"I remember watching this when I was younger--and my husband had never seen it. It was just as good as I remember it, and the scene with Barry being abducted still creeped me out (my husband agreed it was intense). We enjoyed watching it together, and it will be something we will definitely watch again. And my husband agrees that it's important NOT to trust the aliens...regardless of what happened. :-)"
3,Classic,"This movie is a cult classic for sure, but not my cup of tea. Fortunately it was only a gift for someone else since I like watching movies that have a lot more engaging material and dialogue than this one."
5,Excellent !,Great Product & Great Service !On Time ! I Recommend Buying this Product !Great Movie Collection and in Perfect Condition a Must for all movie collections !
4,It's Possible,This is one of those movies which my mother had to practically tie me to a chair to get me to watch it. I am glad she did.This movie is one of my all time favorites becuase I have this thought running around which says 'it could have/could be happening'. This possibility and the gentle emotion throughout makes me on the edge of my seat even after my fifth or sixth time watching.I can't watch it every day like I can with some movies but I do watch it about once every two years or so. This is a classic up there with Batteries not Included and I really wish there was a sequal.The only thing which I wonder about is: Is Taken a follow on from this movie? It sure seems like it.Otherwise I have no complaints and love the funny obsessions and determination of the main charaters to see for themselves. You can really imagine it happening that's why I love it.
4,Close Encounters,"Very good transfer to BD, although I think a little more attention to cleaning up the film a bit more would've made it even better. Great movie, sound is good, and really fun to watch."
5,Super Great,"I watch this on my 42"" LED TV. The picture quality was really great. A must have for all you Close Encounter fans, like me."
4,"Great movie, so-so blu-ray","There are some great reviews about the film, so let me just talk about the transfer. I bought the special edition dvd a few years ago. It looked good on my LG BH200, but not as good as the blu-ray version. But it's weird, some scenes look absolutely amazing, while others look grainy and over saturated. Still, it is a heck of a lot better than the dvd version. Do I recommend this blu-ray? Yes, but only if you aren't paying full price."
5,Brilliant!!!,"Truly one of the all-time great movies ever made, it still floors me to think that Spielberg was only about 28 years old when he directed this film. He also wrote it, and it's a damned mature work for his age at the time -- strangely, other films of his that would follow (ie. Indy Jones, E.T., Hook) were entertaining, but not nearly so adult.This film succeeds by making our own fear of the unknown the villian, and not some cliched men-in-black operative, or bug-eyed alien. Few, if any, films have ever duplicated that feat.A masterpiece I would say, both visually and thematically. No film since has captured the scope or awe of what ""first contact"" with an alien species would be like quite like this Spielberg gem.Unfortunately, even this widescreen, letterboxed transfer of the film on video doesn't quite convey the full impact -- only the big-screen can do that. END"
4,CLOSE ENCOUNTERS (Blu-Ray),"This is the clearest, sharpest and most colorful transfer to Blu-Ray DVD I have ever watched! This film was made in 1977, prior to the well explored theme of government conspiracies with evil aliens intent on colonizing Earth. Earlier and later sci-fi films (with the exception of E.T.) have generally attributed much less benign motives to space aliens.Spielberg was able to get his audience to believe in well intentioned aliens interested in making first contact with authorities on Earth. A more difficult film to make interesting to audiences brought up on evil space critters, the film still works and many folks appear to enjoy it. While not one of my favorite films I do enjoy watching the very colorful visual effects."
2,Spielberg's films are all the same...,"I've seen almost every Steven Spielberg film imaginable, from Jaws to Schindler's List, but Close Encounter's Of The Third Kind was a really poor effort I felt. Sure, there's big special effects and stuff...but the story is pretty lame. A man makes stuff out of mashed potatoes and is pretty much obsessed with Devil's Tower. That's all this films about...a man's obsession with mashed potatoes and a mountain...groovy, but boring."
3,Review,"This is one of these movies where the tension builds for a really long time, and when you finally think the prelude is over, and you actually get to see the aliens, the credits roll. Not uncommon for movies made at that time. Beware!!"
4,Great movie... but not the director's cut,I love this movie. I gave it four stars only because I thought I was getting the directors cut with additional footage.
5,CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE 3RD KIND,"QUICK SHIP,BRAND NEW,vhs tape IN THE WRAPPER,as stated,less money than a dvd used,so why not?Love the movie and NET FLIX WON'T STREAM IT!!!"
4,A pretty good flic,"An intriguing story of a man's quest for answers after he gets buzzed by UFOs late one night. The movie progresses quickly and rarely lingers, and comes off as one of the more believable close encounter movies around. It's more than just a sci-fi film, it's a look at what happens when a person can't explain what's driving them forward. Highly recommended except for one flaw; the director's cut removes a few minutes of brilliant footage of a man going nuts to stick on some fancy special effects."
4,"Almost flawless, with one reservation.....","Is it my imagination, or does the McDonalds sign we see as the lights are going out say ""Over 24 Billion Served?"" Seems to me that in the late seventies, these signs said ""Over 6 Million served,"" and indeed, I remember watching this same scene a few years ago on another edition and thinking, ""Boy, things have changed"" when I saw the old style sign. Is there some kind of CGI silliness going on here? Did Columbia-TriStar give in to pressure from McDonald's to bolster their apparent popularity in 1977? What the hell?Otherwise, this is movie I've been waiting to see- CE3K sans the silly tacked-on-inside-the-mothership ending that spoiled what was my favorite movie of '77. And the extras- my God, the extras! The documentary alone is worth the price I paid for it. An essential disc."
4,"Long, Slow, but good","This movie, released 3 years after 'Jaws', is longer than the other film, and also moves faster. However, I thought this film was great. It had good special effects, great acting, and a strong plot unlike a lot of science fiction movies around. It wasn't the same old, ""Kill the aliens, save the world"" idea. (ID4 creators, that one was signaled towards you.) This was how we come to be peaceful and to understand the outside world. It had a magnificent story, however, I don't think Roy (Richard Dreyfuss), would leave his family behind to persue aliens. Also, the ending was dragged on too long. The music is fantastic, and Spielberg is probably the greatest director of all time. Don't expect this to be the best film you will ever see, but if you pay attention and appreciate the great plot that may, in fact, be better than ""E.T."", you should love every second of it. I did."
3,DVD-AUDIO?,"This item is clearly stated by Amazon to be the DVD-Audio of the SOUNDTRACK, yet almost all the reviews treat it as if it were a DVD of the MOVIE."
3,Surprisingly Dated And Unexciting,"While it's always a pleasure to see a good film presented in a better home-theater version than has ever been available, my recent screening of the Blu-Ray version of Close Encounters left me flat.I'm not going to go on at length about why the film didn't work for me or my wife, who are both at the older end of the Baby Boom. Suffice it to say that there's no doubt that the movie is a fine piece of craftmanship all the way around, and the Blu-Ray pressing brings out every visual and aural detail. But none of that quality can turn a story that doesn't ""work"" into an evening of great entertainment.There's no way to know how YOU will react, especially if you haven't watched any version in the past few years. It might be prudent to rent the blu-ray before springing for your own copy.Happy Blu-Ray watching, even if this re-pressing doesn't do the job for you.There are lots of great new discs out there well worth viewing and buying."
2,Deadly Encounter,"A Steven Spielberg movie, as all the world knows, is generally a masterful assemblage of special effects concealing an entirely brainless script. ""Close Encounters"" was made on the credit Spielberg ran up for steering ""Jaws"" to box-office success, and it is just as dim-witted as the fish story. At least when Hollywood made flying saucer movies in the 1950's nobody expected the audience to take them seriously. It was pretty shocking to discover that a man in Spielberg's position actually believed the UFO claptrap in circulation by the mid 70's. Still, it all might have worked if his aliens had amounted to something; they're like a race of speechless squeeze toys. A very poor effort."
3,Close Encounters of WHICH kind ?,"3 stars for this version but 5 star for the original 1977 version. I'm baffled by all these special or collector's additions. The original movie was excellent, don't see the need of any re-editing. I believe it's about money as Steven Spielberg's most movies are. Close Encounters was his last film as a director with innocent creativity that brought great movies like Duel, Sugarland Express, Jaws and Close Encounters. From my point of view, the new ending did hurt the movie. The original one was very satisfying, presented just enough and left much more for our imagination. Obviously Spielberg wanted to re-done this movie in his in ""cheesed up, at times childish, big bang Hollywood style"" which is evident in duds like ET (artistically), Hook (financially).Just leave Close Encounters alone, perhaps make another ET (hope not)if he feels the need for more alien, sci-fi flicks."
2,A little disappointed,"I had been hearing how great this movie was but I had never seen it. So I bought the dvd. I was a little disappointed. This version has the added scenes that were not shown in the original theatrical release, and maybe that is what I don't like. It is slow and too long. If you have already seen it and liked it then this is a good dvd, but if you haven't scene it, I would rent it first, just in case."

2,NOT WIDESCREEN VERSION,"Close Encounters Of The Third KindReview of instant video,This is the croped version of the collectors edition. And the quality of the video is poor. I regret the 10 dollars I spent on this. Found the Directors Cut on a competitor site,in widescreen and dvd quality video, for the same price.So shop around. The Competitor site starts with a ""V"" and ends with ""U"". I've been happy with all my other purchases but this one was a disapointment."
5,Spielberg at his finest.,"The two-disc Blu Ray edition of CE3K is amazing. The movie itself is on Disc 1, in all three of its incarnations (original, special edition, and director's cut). I love that a ""map"" of the differences among the three versions is included in the packaging so that you can easily tell which changes were made to each version. In addition, there's a feature on the Blu Ray itself that makes you aware of these changes as you're watching.The second disc is chock full of interesting and informative special features. If you're a Spielberg nut like me, you'll have no problem sitting there for hours devouring all of the behind-the-scenes featurettes, trailers, etc.Somehow, this film seems to have lost some of its ""buzz"" over time, in comparison with other Spielberg films, but I still hold it up there in his top 3 or 4. Highly recommended viewing."
1,Blu-ray Essentials edition has no extras!,"As of this writing, the slipcase shown in the picture at Amazon for the Blu-ray essentials edition has the words ""30th Anniversary Ultimate Edition"" printed on the slipcase, which of course implies that the Blu-ray you would receive has the same content as the 30th Anniversary Ultimate Edition. This is NOT correct! The disc I received did not have the 30th anniversary text on the outer or inner cases, and does not contain any of the special features included with the Ultimate Edition. Very deceptive, and I will be returning mine.This edition does appear to have all three versions of the movie (theatrical, special edition, director's cut), so if all you want is the movie itself and if you can get it at a significant discount to the Ultimate Edition, then it might be an option. Otherwise, I would definitely opt for the 30th anniversary edition which at the moment is actually quite a bit cheaper than this watered-down edition!!!"
4,Classic finally given the HD treatment,"This DVD will contain 3 versions of the movie on 1 disc, with a stack of bonus extras.Original Theatrical Version (1977)Special Edition (1980)Director's Cut (1998)Special Features:All 3 versions of the film branched on the 1 discGround-breaking version schematic that tracks the versionsNew 2007 interview with Spielberg talking about the versionsAcclaimed 100 minute documentary from Collector's Edition release42 minute ""Making of"" documentaryPhoto gallerySpecial packaginginformation from... [..]the standard edtion will be presented as a 3 disc set presented in a box with additional artwork, [...]"
5,sentimental SF + fantastic BD transfer,"Other than to remark that this is remarkably sentimental film, of the ""How I wish aliens would come down and save humanity"" ilk, I'll limit myself to the quality of the Blu-ray transfer.This is one of the best BDs I've yet seen, essentially equalling the quality of ""The Fifth Element"" and coming close to ""The Searchers"". It is absolutely of demo quality, with extreme sharpness and detail, and little or no visible edge enhancement. The black levels are unbelievable. Most of the time it's difficult to see any difference between the film's blacks and the letterbox banding on my Pioneer Kuro. Makes me glad I bought it!"
1,Trumbull and Williams,"The idea of an ""everyman"" confronting aliens is a great plot device, but Spielberg's ham fisted direction sinks this project. It COULD have been a classic. I was rather taken with it back when it played first-run, but now I can see that the effects work of Doug Trumbull and the music of John Williams were what really kept this afloat initially. Also, this blu-ray looks grainier than the theatrical presentation."
1,very disappointing,I thought this video would be a great demonstration for my sound system but the sound levels very limited in range and the final blast from the mothership is barely louder than the first. The movie itself has lost its emotional appeal.Rent this one.
2,when will it end?,This movie lingered and lingered. I couldn't wait for it to end. The reason i gave it a 2/5 is because it somewhat kept my interest
1,A weak load of bunk.,"I love Speilberg films, I really do, but the fact that he is a good director is no excuse for this crap. I just do not like it, its not my thing. I can't belive that Richard Dreyfuss turned down reprising his role in Jaws 2 because he was filming this nonsense. If you want to watch it, then go ahead, we all have different tastes. However, if you want to see a real Speilberg film, watch ones like Duel, Jaws, ET, Schindler's list, Jurassic Park, The Lost World: Jurassic Park, and The Indiana Jones Trilogy."
3,A Blast from the Past,"If you've got the time to spare (and who didn't back in 1977?) then re-watching this old timer with a good picture is probably worth it. No commentary, but everything you would need to know is in the making of featurette, including tiredy looking Steven Spielberg on a Private Ryan set. He's a family man now, so he says he can't make movies about faithless men who leave their wives for a bunch of baloney. Why not? I suspect he may, like Lucas, be being put out to pasture soon."
3,"Overhyped, but sets the tone for future Speilberg works","While this is one of Speilberg's overly hyped movies, it fairs well. I found the movie slow paced and boring in lots of places, causing me to fall asleep on some viewings. The movie has great special effects (for the time) and great acting. The transfer was good, but fuzzy in some places..I was expecting a bit more from Columbia and Speilberg since their other realeases are amazingly beautiful. Kudas for the second disc chalk full of goodies and great packaging..keep this away from the kids."
4,"Good to see the orginal film again, it needs the S/E ending!","G'day from Australia, when l found out about the ""Collectors Edition"" being released, l couldn't wait to get acopy. Close Encounters wont be released here in Australia for quite some months! so thanks to Amazon.com l received a copy from USA, which plays very well on my system here, it was so good to see all the scenes that are removed from the ""Special Edition"" but l hoped, l really hoped that because it was called the ""Collectors Edition"" it may include the Special Edition ending sequence as well, but no, l dont know why Steven Spielberg, or whoever, didn't do us fans a favour and edited it all together..oh well it is good to have the Orginal release in the library non the less..Clint.J"
4,Pretty good but not blown away,"This was the first Blu-ray disk I bought and I wanted to be blown away by the differences between this format and DVD. Although it does look a little better, I wasn't smacked in the face by the antennas on the alien ship when it turns over, nor was I ducking for cover when the spaceships are flying past the people beside the road. Other Blu-ray disks I've bought since this one have blown me away (like the Planet Earth anthology), so I don't think the discrepancy between my dreams and reality are technology related.Don't get me wrong, Close Encounters is entertaining no matter how many times you've seen it. Spielberg is a master storyteller and the special features are very entertaining. However, if you're going to by one Blu-ray disk to impress your friends and neighbors with 50"" 1080p and surround sound (and maybe your Harmony remote) - this isn't the disk to buy."
5,Written and directed by Stephen Spielberg,This includes 3 versions of the film.The amazing blu-ray picture and audio quality make this movie seem new again.Can't recommend this title enough.
5,WHICH ENDING IS ON IT?,"I wondered if the disk had the original ending or the ""extended"" ending that came out a few years after the theatrical version.Well, it has the theatrical version ending; the extended ""inside the ship"" ending is included in the extra scenes chapter.Better this way, IMO, since the original leaves the sense of unknown in the viewer. And the inside of the ship was kind of simplistic anyway - it looks like rock concert lights!"
1,GOOD RIDDANCE TO A TOAD OF A HUSBAND,"If I had a husband that lost his job, didnt look for new work to support his family, trashes my kitchen, argues with me in front of our three kids, runs off to passionately kiss a single mom, then hops aboard a UFO, GOOD RIDDANCE!The ending of the film should have been the aliens harvasting his organs. They wanted to know what a lousy earth husband was made of."
1,Havnt seen....,I havnt seen the movie but it REALLY sounds like stephan kings tommyknocker like the sound of it made me think of that book right away. Its a movie I've only seen once to.
2,Lone Hold Out,"I may be the lone hold out, but.... on my Samsung DLP , the transfer is terrible. I am of the opinion that the HD transfer is also enhancing the grain of a thirty year old movie. The DNIe engine in my Samsung is making that grain more enhanced. Any family scenes in the house look like they're in a snow storm. Other than that the outdoor scenes are great, and the colors and sound are awesome. If you have a Samsung DLP, though, you will have to watch it with the DNIe off. The picture is not as sharp, but the snow is not as bad. By the way, I looked at the regular DVD version in the same Blu- Ray player and there was a little grain, but no snow... with the DNIe engaged. 32 dollars wasted? Hard to say at this point. Anybody else having this problem?"
2,"Another good idea, screwed by Spielberg...","Honestly? It seems a lot like E.T.I hadn't seen it before. I figured it'd be a documentary. Then I started watching it. It seemed good. Then go all ""magical"". Screw that. Although the tape is in good condition, and it works well, the movie really sucked.Thanks though for the price; I'd recommend the seller I bought this from."
2,Dissapointing as an adult,"I saw this movie when I was 10. I loved it! Must have seen it 5 times in the theater. Bright lights, spaceships, friendly aliens, action - couldn't get enough of the eye candy. As an adult, and a avid sci-fi movie-goer, I could not stomach watching it. With the FX now passe, it was a painful journey through a shallow, self-serving story with so many loose ends that left me frowning. The editing in this ""restored"" version is atrocious and abrupt, and the sound quality is dissapointing despite the THX/DTS rating. The premise of the story remains incredible and hopeful. The execution, however, is terrible. As a DVD this is okay for the bonus material - the ONLY reason it got two stars."
5,Great product!,Product arrived on time and fit perfectly on my car. I was skeptical because I was afraid that it would not fit in my car. When the part arrived it came well packaged and ready to be installed. I would recommend this to anyone.
4,Very Interesting,I bought this book before I had a consultation with Jay. I love this book because it is basically a list of each patient profile and what he saw in the body that was causing their problem. I gave it 4 stars because I'd like to see more description of how and what he actually sees. I found his consultaiton to be remarkable accurate.
2,Dissapointed,"I was hopeful that this book would be a discussion of Mr. Caliendo's work, as a medical practitioner who incorporates intuition into my work, i am always interested in how others bring their skill to bear in healing work, but this book is more a partial discussion of his diagnosis, with no indication of what the person was presenting with, their story, nor the outcome of his observation. In truth, i only read but a few pages, then skimmed the text before becoming disheartened, it then went to my bookcase and has stayed there since."
5,Just Brilliant!,"When I was in the second grade Barry Louis Pollisar came to my school. He was just wonderful and like nothing we had ever heard before. We bought a few of his tapes, which we continued to listen to for years. They made it through my brother and me, my sister, and my daughter and we still talk about them all the time.It was just thrilling to find this album here and listed to all of those songs once again! They are still as wonderful now as they were 25 years ago and I will never get sick of hearing them. I have got copies for me, my mother, and both of my siblings for Christmas."
3,Not really what I expected,Decent book but it talked mostly about people who had a lot of money and those who had very little money. There wasn't really much focus on those of us in the middle. Became very redundant after a while.
1,Very disappointing,This was a total waste of money. Nothing original in this book. It doesn't really go past the obvious antagonism between money (materialism) and spirituality. A lot of name dropping but no substance whatsoever.
4,Great Book to Point Out World Financial Inequities,"I really appreciate the author's personal experience of realization that the pursuit of the success driven, conspicuous consumptive and time squeezed lifestyle leaves one empty and exhausted! Her international work to serve other cultures to interact with the global economy while retaining their own culture and values is outstanding. However, I felt the main weakness of the book was that it left a vacuum for wisdom to the masses regarding how they can connect their financial lives to the life of the soul."
2,Could have been much better,"I got a lot out of the beginning of this book, the story of a culture that functions without money, and also the recounting of Twist's experience with Mother Teresa. But after that it became, as one reviewer put it, ""redundant"", almost unreadable. ""We"" (our culture) are constantly being characterized as in the race for ""more""--which, while it describes the corporate and political cultures, does not reflect my experience of individuals in my circle at all. I do, however, believe fervently in (and contribute regularly to) The Hunger Project, for whom Twist works, and their smart self-empowering methods to end hunger. My suggestion is to get this book out of the library, read the interesting parts, and donate the cost of the book to The Hunger Project."
3,A different way to think about money,"I needed to read this book as a book group assignment; otherwise, I may have missed it. While there is some preachiness, the author gets her point across with many personal observations and experiences that add depth to the message. I don't know a person to whom this topic doesn't apply. The book helps remind us that we have more personal value than what is measured in dollars even if we do need to work out a different method of accounting to see and feel that value. ""The Soul of Money:.."" is a fairly quick read."
3,Don't you wish. . .,that money had less power over your life? Thsi book is a certain guide to breaking emotional and metal molds in one of life's touchiest areas. Lynne Twist's exploration of the spiritual side of money adn wealth is a heartening introduction to a way of thinking that can change the way the world does business. Her insights are that powerful.
1,Apologetics not Science,"Pullen ignores any and all research that does not support his theology. At first glance I though it was another book on RNA world but Pullen had no intention of providing a scholarly review. Creationist pulp fiction dressed up as a serious scholarly work, essentially deceitful."
3,I'm glad there's a band still doing this style,"I was in my teens during the 80s and witnessed classic metal split into thrash and hair. Hammerfall is what you get if that split had never happened - classic 80s style heavy metal. Is it original? No. Is it fantastic? Depends on the song. Is it better than a lot of metal being put out today? Yes. My favorite is probably 'Blood Bound.' That's a cool anthem straight out of 1985. There's some good melodic solos on this record and they have an actual singer. Oh yeah, Cronos from Venom makes on appearance on the final track. Great to hear him again. He still sounds the same - which is a compliment. I guess you could call him a classic extreme vocalist but he doesn't sound cartoonish like the extreme vocalists of today. I like Legacy of Kings by this band better, though. If you like this, check out Blind Guardian. They have a similar style but their overall musicianship is leaps and bounds above Hammerfall."
2,What happened part 2 1.5 out of 5,"These guys used to be good, especially during the ""Glory to the Brave"" and ""Legacy of Kings"" days. The only track I somewhat liked on this was Blood Bound, I know this band is better than this."
3,Dissapointed,"Well first I must say my favorite cd of theres is Legacy of kings. I love the whole singing together and chanting woahhhhh,, woahhhh,, If you heard the singers solo cd cans beyond then gates and liked it you may like this. I have heard this cd 4 times so far and will probbaly not listen to it to much. It may get better Im not sure. maybee there running out of ideas it seems the singers solo project is influenced here. I would burn it."
3,Just don't expect anything groundbreaking from these guys...,"Just don't expect anything coming from this band to be original, onnovative or whatever. Hammerfall is stuck into his style more than Iron Maiden or AC/DC or Motorhead, and they could not care less. They simply don't / won't change even a little bit.This album is exactly identical to the others: theme of the lyrics, general sound (producer Charles Bauerfeind makes all European power metal bands sound the same)."
5,Still scary!,Even though I watched this movie like three times the climax at the end still makes me jump!
4,Terrific thriller,"I remember watching this on television in the 1970's and it was one the scariest films of any genre I'd ever seen. Audrey Hepburn is superb in an Oscar nominated performance as a blind women terrorised by 3 men who are looking for a doll which contains drugs. Its tautly directed by Terence Young (who also directed the first two James Bond films 'Dr No' and 'From Russia with love'). The excellent music soundtrack is by Henry Mancini.As well as the usual trailers, the DVD has an interesting short extra called 'A Look in the Dark' in which Alan Arkin and the Producer Mel Ferrer (who was married to Audrey Hepburn) look back at the film. This is only about 10 minutes but its quite informative.However the main reason to buy the DVD is the film, and once it starts you will be hooked."
5,A Jolting Ending,"There is not a lot you can write about this movie, Wait Until Dark, without giving it away. I can only say that if you enjoy surprise endings, this is a great movie."
3,SUSPENSE THRILLER IN A BORING TRANSFER,"""Wait Until Dark"" has Audrey Hepburn playing Suzie, a blind woman who is victimized by a trio of men after a doll stuffed with heroin turns up in her apartment. Richard Crenna plays the most deceitful of the ""baddies"".TRANSFER: Warner has done a rather average job of mastering the film for DVD. Colors are dated, at times faded. Fine detail tends to get lost during the night scenes in a sea of undistinguished black levels, while certain darker scenes also suffer from excessive film grain. Flesh tones are not accurate and reds appear more orange than red. Overall, a boring video presentation, though edge enhancement and pixelization are kept to a bare minimum. The audio is mono and strident.Extras: A featurette with producer Mel Ferrer sharing his favorite memories and the original theatrical trailer.BOTTOM LINE: This is a worth while thriller that will leave you on the edge of your seat. But the transfer may have you falling asleep."
4,Spellbinder,I found this movie every bit aa suspenseful today as when I first saw it in 1967 - Love Hepburn.
5,Perhaps you better watch this in the daylight,"This is a nail-biting thriller! The less you know about the plot, the more you will be surprised as details unfold. When I saw it the first time, I didn't even know Hepburn was...Movie quote: ""Damn it, you act as if you're in kindergarten! This is the big bad world, full of mean people, where nasty things happen!"""
5,"Don't wait, see it NOW!!!","This movie is a suspenseful mystery, not a movie filled with blood and gore. This movie tells people of this day and age that you don't a lot of blood and gore to be scared out of your wits. I am a young pre teen myself and I especially loved this movie. Even my sixteen year old brother and his friends liked it!!!"
5,Last 15 minutes are a scream!!!!!,"I was on the edge of my seat the entire movie. Wait Until Dark is the perfect thriller to watch in complete darkness when you're home alone (that is, if you don't scare easily). The last fifteen minutes are more chilling, more hair-raising, and more gripping then any other fifteen minutes in film history. In one part of the last scene, I screamed so loud, I probably woke up the neighbors. Seriously! Don't pass this one by!"
5,Different !,"Different in a good way. My sister would tell you not to watch this movie alone in the dark, but I tell you do. Its affect is so much more potent that way. You will literally sit on the edge of your seat until this film is over. The plot plays out perfectly and the mystery and suspense is high! To help create the effect of blindness for this movie, Audrey wore thick contacts that dulled her eyes and vision. She memorized where everything was on the set so that in the dark, she was perfectly comfortable. Alan Arkin makes an incredibly nasty bad guy and Audrey's fear of him is quite catching, even over the screen. You scream out your feelings for this movie, if it hits you right."
4,Stands the test of time!,"An excellent cast and plot makes this movie a compelling thriller. It's great to see Hepburn, Crenna, Zimbalist Jr. Weston and Arkin together weaving their magic. The cars in the scenes may show their age, but the movie does not. Good is good, and this film is definitely worth watching."
5,One of the most heartstopping moment ever.,"Watch this with the lights out and your heart will stop when... One of the best classic suspense movies I have seen. Audrey, lovely as ever, blind finds herself at the mercy of bad guys. but who has the edge?"
5,Delightfully suspensful!,"This is the first time I have seen an Audrey Hepburn movie, and I loved it! The strength of her character is what made the movie, and the intricate plans of the villians made it almost funny, yet scary at the same time! I couldn't believe the ending!"
4,Always thrilling,I remember seeing this in the theater years ago and we were told not to tell anyone about the ending. It was terrific watching it again after all those years.
5,Excellent Movie,For me this is a classic movie. It's fun to watch in the dark with all of the lights off.
3,Unique Audrey Hepburn movie.,"I had watched this movie before. It starts a little slow, but once it is mainly featuring Audrey, it is good. It is a different Audrey Hepburn from other movies of hers. I got it just because I like Audrey Hepburn."
4,In the dark...,"Audrey Hepburn as Susy Hendrix, a blind wife to a photographer, unknowingly ends up with a doll stuffed with drugs in her basement apartment. The story becomes highly suspenseful as criminals attempt to retrieve the doll at all costs. Audrey Hepburn performs brilliantly and convincingly as the blind wife who must face her handicap as well as the hardened villains. At the end, Wait Until Dark offers a strong cinematic experience."
4,Switch Off the House Lights for the Final Fifteen!,"As usual, Audrey Hepburn was giggling throughout this entire production, but definitely NOT when the cameras rolled! She turns in a very convincing performance as a terrified (for good reason!) blind woman with class and dignity. Indeed, Hepburn's spirit, and gutsy, determined character carries an otherwise lackluster storyline. Terence Young also helps save the day by directing with a Hitchcockian flare! The remaining cast members contribute solid acting despite pretty much stereotypical characterizations. Besides Hepburn, the little girl next door is undoubtedly the most savvy and memorable. This film features fifteen, count em', fifteen (continuous), of the scariest minutes ever recorded in cinematic history! It's a thrilling conclusion to a suspenseful movie that, unfortunately, possesses its share of lackluster and unsettling moments as well. Try watching the last fifteen minutes in the dark!"
3,Handi-capable acts of heroism!,"being blind in an NYC basement appt is scary enough, but to tackle bad guys using ingenious tactics to get the upperhand was truly impressive and unexpected, Audrey is convincing as a warrior instinct survivor and does well to maintain and extend the suspense beyond typical fearful life threatening scenes, was thinking her screams may possibly have been heard given she seems normal, has local friends in the building but no mention of callousness of neighbors to help another... more likely in dense woods, deserted highway etc. all the hullabaloo for some minute contraband imho, geez, some operation... nonetheless great to see the empowerment of a disabled woman and save her family from the evildoers of NYC!"
3,"Interesting, but Timeworn","Audrey Hepburn stars as the 'world's best blind lady' and Alan Arkin is evil personified, stopping at nothing to reclaim a missing doll stuffed with heroin. The predictable portion involves a long terror scene in the dark, after Hepburn breaks all the light bulbs to neutralize her sight disadvantage. The plot also gets a bit stretched when she sends the neighbor girl to fetch her husband (who was misdirected by Arkin and is not where she thinks he is) for help, instead of simply to call the police. On the other hand, Hepburn also displays quick thinking in other portions, and the plot is creative in how Arkin et al try to fool Hepburn into revealing the doll's location."
3,Time has not been kind to this one,"Last 10 minutes are still pretty fun, but otherwise ... whew! Way too over orchestrated in almost ridiculous ways, very campy dialogue, sudden, unexplainable character developments and a very weird, very 60's cheesey love song at the finale. A shame really."
4,Good Movie to Watch at Night,"Possibly Audrey Hepburn's greatest acting performance. Audrey does an excellent job portraying a young blind woman who is terrorized by people trying to find something they believe she is hiding. This is not a standard thriller. There is very little language and violence. This is a movie you can watch with older kids which will provide a good scare. Not a movie I would recommend if you are trying to find standard Audrey, but Audrey fans will enjoy as will fans of thrillers."
2,Watr Until Dark,I received this VHS tape on June 30th. I thought that I ordered a DVD of Wait Until Dark but I returned the VHS still shrink wrapped on the same day as I received it. I have not received any correspondence from Cinema Cornucopia and as of August 3rd I have not received a DVD nor a return of my fee and no credit is listed on my credit card.
1,Don't waste your money,This movie is not scarey. This movie is not even funny because it's trying to be scarey. Just an incredible waste of film and time.
5,turnabout is fair play,"The world loves Audrey Hepburn, but I find this film to be her at her strongest -- take charge moments abound and surprises. I don't know what I can say that others haven't but this is a wonderful film and very empowering in many ways."
5,Watch It In The Dark,"This is the kind of thriller I like. I find the blood and gore slasher films to be boring and unimaginative. But Wait Until Dark builds up genuine suspense with it's clever plot and psychological tension. Hepburn stars as blind woman whose husband has inadvertently taken possession of a doll with drugs hidden in it. Alan Arkin stars as a twisted criminal that wants to get his hands on the doll, and he enlists Richard Crenna and Jack Weston to join him in fooling the blind woman into handing over the doll. Hepburn is terrific as the blind woman who proves to be more self-sufficient than she probably even thought she was, and Arkin is very scary as the psycho who terrorizes her. The way that the men go about getting the doll is fascinating, and the way the film is constructed, the viewer really feels the suspense from the point of view of someone who is blind and that much more vulnerable. This is a suspense film that everyone should see."
3,not satisfied,I had to return this dvd as it was pixillated in various parts of the story. I was very disappointed. This seems to happen whenever I order a classic movie.
2,Joan Lower y Nixon disappoints,"Having noticed many Joan Lowery Nixon books on Amazon.com,I was eager to try one of her books.She seemed very good.In fact she probably is.Perhaps I chose the wrong book.It is boring,dull,non-eventful.The entire book insists of Kristen arguing with various different people on hte matter of women's rights with nothing ever happening!"
5,Cinderella - Live at the key club (Import/Extra Trax),"In classic Cinderella style, this live recording at the end of the unfinished business tour is no dissappointment. Their live versions of Gypsy Road, Shake Me, and Hot and Bothered is awesome rock n roll at its best. This record is prime example of Tom Keifer's talent and showmanship. A must have for any Cinderella fan as well as anyone who can appreciate good rock."
1,UNFORGETTABLE EXPERIENCE,"Watching CINDERELLA live is an unforgettable experience, because you'll realize how bad their ""music"" is. Disguised as hard-rock, rock and roll, whatever, their songs are so awful, they're a shame to rock. No wonder the markt got fed up with this glam bands which almost destroyed real metal and gave room to the invasion of lousy styles like rap and techno. Blergh!"
4,Raw but Rocks,"Great band, pretty good live release. If you are into ""live"" releases, I would recommend this over any of the studio releases including the ""greatest hits""...Most, if not all of the classic releases are on this ""live"" release and seem to have a raw but electric energy. Turn it up, play it loud, almost like being there."
4,Not Available for Streaming?,"This film has been around for quite some time. I can't help but wonder why it's not available for streaming. I don't care to own a copy of it, but I would like to watch it thru my Roku. Amazon.. any thoughts?"
4,3 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:Neither historically accurate nor an effective police procedural, Mississippi Burning succeeds despite its flaws due to the fact that it can boast a trio of fine performances and an exquisite sense of atmosphere and menace."
3,very very used!,It was very very used with water damage to the case. I don't know which company sent me the dvd?
1,mississippi burning,video does not work. It has a title that says it is not programmed for this region. Maybe because it was shipped from the United Kingdom. This movie was a total waste of money
3,Not 100% what I expected,Video plays very well but I wish I would have known it was a bootlegged copy before purchase.
5,"Tense, gripping, thought-provoking, first-class acting","Gene Hackman and the rest of the cast excel in this stark and utterly gripping portrayal of the FBI's crackdown on racism in Mississippi. It is far from 100 per cent historically accurate, but name me a film that is. In any event, it captures the mood of the times well enough. Some may not be comfortable with its suggestion that the FBI had to emulate the racists' thuggery in order to defeat them. But surely the main point is that the movie's overall message is uncompromisingly in favor of tolerance and a shared humanity."
1,Deceptive labeling,"The DVD will not play in the U.S. When I initially ordered it, I was not aware that Region 2 would not play in the U.S. In addition, the vendor will only accept a return if I eat the shipping. Not acceptable."
4,Good movie,"This is a good movie, with decent acting. Gene Hackman delivers in this powerful portrayal of the civil rights era"
1,bad,I love this movie. I didn't like the dvd I received. Watched about 85% of the movie and then the dvd decided to stop. It stayed at that point and I could do nothing to see the last 15% of the movie. Sent it back.
1,Mississippi Burning,I enjoy this movie. However it displays a message with any DVD Player I play it in. Even with my computer the movie doesn't play due to out of region.
3,Looked new but was broken,"This VHS was received within the time promised. It was well packed and sealed. However, when the package was opened, the plastic cassette was broken on the left side where the tape feeds into the player. Was able to view the movie but wonder if this break will affect future viewings."
1,Misleading,The DVD that arrived does not play in U.S. DVD players... so why is it being sold on the Amazon US site? Waste of 13 dollars.
4,School review,"I was only 16 when I saw this movie as part of a history class. We were studying the Civil Rights movement. To have such a moving, powerful drama to depict what times were like was very helpfull. Sure, Parker never made the movie to be a documentary and it isn't. It gives an idea of the feeling around Mississippi and is worth the watch."
3,Racism from all sides?,"One person who reviewed this film asked the question, ""where are the black voices?"" I think there were black voices in this film. The problem is that those voices were weak, cowardly and ineffectual. It's as if black southerners had no part in the struggle for their own freedom. Freedom and equal rights could only be obtained by the good will of northern whites and the united states government. In some way this white liberal racist attitude isn't much better than the low life klansmen.The best way to view this movie is from the perspective of good versus evil. Good does win out and the evil klan is brought to justice. That does mean something. The production is good and the performances are too. Gene hackman gives an oscar caliber performance and willem defoe is convincing. Certainly an entertaining film but it doesn't reach it's potential as a great film................socks"
4,Excellent historical review of our nations racial problems,"Willem DeFoe and Gene Hackman are FBI agents who lead a search in Jessup County Mississippi, to find three young civil rights people who were reported missing. The small town mississippians don't take the athority of the Federal Government agents well, spuring other racial assaults. This Oscar nominated film presents all angles of the racial problems of the 1960's in the deep south. The blacks and all other minorities were too afraid to fight, for fear that the whites would destroy their homes and possibly kill them. Proven by history and shown in this film, sometimes when a problem arises you have to fight and accept all consiquences instead of waiting, which sometimes doesn't solve anything. The acting is supurb and the direction is very well done. Frances McDormand is excellent as the deputies wife."
5,Wonderful,"This movie is wonderful - script, actors, direction. The tale of what went on in Jessup County Mississippi in 1964 jumps into your heart and mind thanks to ""Mississippi Burning"". If you have yet to watch it, please do it will change your life."
3,Great Acting / Low Facts,"Historically fiction, but there is a great story here anyway. Excellent acting here too. A corrupt town in Mississippi full of racists and KKK clan are treating the black folk like slavery still existed in 1964 America. Not enough performances by black actors but when there is,, there are important messages."
1,mississippi burning,"I was sent dvd that couldnt even be watch in the usa, and I had to pay to return them!!!"
5,Hackman at his best.,"Gene Hackman was, and still is, one of the best actors of all time. In this film, he plays an FBI agent out to find the truth on what happened with three young boys. Willem Defoe also gives an excellent turn as Gene's FBI partner.This film hit every mark, in acting and writing. Wonderfully shot. Hackman deserved his Oscar nomination."
