4,More Precious Than Silver,"I was very pleased with this book. I have used several other of Joni's Devotionals, and used them as Christmas presents. But I would have liked to have a more detailed synopsis of the book on your website. It would have helped me to decide easier which book I would like to purchase."
1,Only Volume II in this book--Missing Volume I,I bought this exact edition many years ago and was disappointed when it arrived and it was NOT both volumes: Vol I and Vol II. It was only Vol II (starting at page 641) but I forgot about it. Now I find that I need some readings in Vol I and I cannot find it. This edition is the only one I can find and I KNOW it is not complete even though it is advertised as such!Can anyone help? It is NOT the two volume set it advertises it is!Tom
4,What??,"I'm a little confused. I purchased this book because of it's comprehensiveness (1400+ pages of work by Weber), but when the book arrived, it was only about 700 pages long. Am I missing something here? If I paid $20 for a used 1400 page copy and receive a 700 page book, should I only be charged $10? Strange."
3,It's OK,I had different expectations of this album thinking it was all the Boston Symphony or something. Only like half the thing. There are tedious operatic versions of some carols. Good service however.
5,Art Is For The People,"I wouldn't even pretend to be any kind of expert in the field of classical music, so I won't attempt to review this CD from that standpoint. I will say this: the Verdi ""Requiem"" is my favorite classical work. I have loved it ever since I sang it in the Chorus as a college freshman. I've heard several versions of it, and this one seems to be of the highest quality. One detail that I noticed instantly is that it moves along at a rather sprightly pace, while others I've heard seemed to drag a little. On a personal note: segments of the ""Requiem"" were played at the funeral service for Princess Diana, and I watched this on television on the same day that I saw Madonna's ""Evita"" for the first time. The similarities in the two tableaus presented was emotionally shattering for me."
1,Not the same as from other companies,"While this is generally the best car wash on the market - the bottle I received from patricobooks was a completely different color from the many bottle previously purchased from Auto Barn. I have frankly been afraid to use it and it is not worth returning because of shipping costs.I would not purchase this from patricobooks, go to Auto Barn."
2,typical french scumbag,"Documentary about a radical French/Vietnamese lawyer who might have spent years in Cambodia during its genocide---the middle of this movie is spent wondering, excusing, hinting where the lawyer disappeared during the 70s, and since nobody comes up with an answer, it's possible he was leading a good life in Cambodia while the average Cambodian was being slaughted by French-speaking, left-wing, Cambodians.Lots of talking heads in this movie, though some good archive footage.Worthwhile for one viewing, though too boring for repeated viewings.Cannes film festival is a joke; the French loved Nazi Leni Refinstahl, Roman Polanksi, and Michael Moore."
5,Awsome first computer game,"My son loved this game, and learned ALL of his letters before he was two years old. This was his first computer game, and paved the way for a love of computers and letters."
4,Daughter loves it!,"My daughter loved the hard copy of this CD-ROM and enjoys this just as much. I just wish that they had a feature that would allow you to start the book so that it ""read"" it to the child."
4,"great taste, but. . .","NOT instant, as the package says. To be fair, the package does also have, in somewhat smaller and less prominent print, a detailed statement telling the buyer that microwaving/cooking will be necessary. BUT if you just look at the package front, you'll get the impression you can make this like you make instant oatmeal. Not so.I hate using microwaves, so that was a big turn-off for me.All that said, the stuff is delicious and definitely warms me up and fills my tummy, keeping me from getting hungry better than most oatmeals do.The texture is thicker and heartier than regular instant oatmeals, kind of a cross between a light muesli and oatmeal. I make mine, add about 2 ounces of organic skim milk, and I'm good to go. The sweetness is light and wonderful, no overly-sugary yuckiness."
1,difference of opinion,I would love to know what the cereal is on the front of this box..it looks great ! Nothing at all like the smooth slimy oatmeal IN the box. Talk about false advertising ! However my husband is scarfing down a bowl of this muck making yummy noises. No accounting for tastes.
5,Delicious,"Great hot cereal! Love it in the morning or as a late night snack! Low cal and high protein and great on those cold winter days! Make it with milk or water, either way is delicious."
5,Kashi Oatmeal,"I like eating this Kashi oatmeal and the Quaker Oats one. I like the Kashi one because it is naturally sweetened with honey and cinnamon and not a whole bunch of sugar like the Quaker Oats one tends to be. Also this oatmeal has more of a nutty (or different) flavoring to it over the Quaker Oats. I also noticed that it seems to take just a bit longer for this oatmeal to cook versus the Quaker Oats, but that doesn't bother me."
5,FAVORITE oatmeal,"I eat oatmeal almost every day for breakfast, and this brand and flavor is by far my favorite. It has a great not-too-sweet flavor and a good crunch. I also appreciate that it has less calories and more protein than most other brands' flavored instant oatmeals."
5,Not a rip off!!!,"To the person who states that the price is a rip off...if you can read you would see that Amazon offers a six pack and if you can also multiply you would also know that six times three is eighteen...I love the taste and the fact that there are whole grains, plus soy, so i dont have to use milk, also there is honey and cane juice included so there is no need to add sugar either..."
1,Books like this are a dime a dozen,More Fabian Socialism. Save your money and buy the Communist Manafesto
3,Patterns of a Dated Democracy?,"Arend Lijphart's ""Patterns of Democracy"" has become a standardized text within the comparative politics subfield, but I think the question needs to be asked ""Given all the divergence in regime type that sprouted with the downfall of the Soviet Union, is the pure Westminster system still a viable starting point for analyzing the points of democratic governance. There's such a regime diversity these days that even regimes of a Westminster character have mutated into systems with two or three different characters. Its' still relevant information particularly when differentiating between presidential and prime ministerial type systems, cabinets, electoral systems etc. But I have to question whether the mixing of systemic elements has left Patterns of Democracy, a dated treatment of a system that has drastically changed."
1,Amateur tosh,"How did this book ever get published? Absolute rubbish! All the characters are one dimensional, whose answer to every crisis is to offer them a cup of tea whilst resting a hand on their shoulder. You have to read it to believe how bad it really is!"
4,An Excellent introduction to Northern Magick,"This book gets two thumbs up from me. One for the material in the book, the other for the CD. Freya Aswynn is to be highly commended for her work in this area which is a blend of scholastic research and soul searching. There are some aspects that differ from a purely academic approach to Runelore and Northern Magic, but the book also illustrates the powerful results from this sort of magio-spiritual work which is rooted in academia and made manifest through personal experience.The CD is chilling and awsome in the recital of the Havamal and vibration of the runes. I highly reccomend it."
4,One of the better books on the runes,"There is a lot of garbage being printed about the runes and most of these authers do not know what they are talking about eighter. But Freya Aswynn is diffrent she knows her craft well. She does not just give out iformation on how to read the runes or the divination meanings of each rune, she goes deeper than that. She goes into the esoteric meanings of them. She also gives out a bit of information on some of the goddesses and gods of the Nordic pantheon. Her work is orderly and not sloppy."
3,Different,Ok book was very long and informative. Can be hard to follow. I had to use multiple colors of hi-lighters. Helped with understanding runes and came with a handy runic bookmark.
5,"Finally Mozart with ""Style""!",I love these recordings! Grumiaux plays with sparkle and finesse and Colin Davis conducts the exactly the same way!I'm glad they re-released these on Philips 50 label...much deserved!Breathe in the fresh air and spring warmth of these recordings! Ahhh...
2,Poor sound quality,"Only after buying it I found out this is a CD made from older recording. Some of those have poor quality, In particular K454 and K526 that were recorded in 1956!"
4,Funny and insightful,"As a current 1L at YLS, I can vouch for the accuracy of Goodrich's account - even down to Guido's ""Evil Deity"" speech, which apparently remains unchanged 15 years later. In fact, not much seems to have changed at all in 15 years, which is a little daunting given Goodrich's insightful criticism of the state of legal education. This is an excellent book for anyone thinking of law school - both as preparation for the stressful academics of first year, and for the tremendous and disconcerting shift in perspective and thought processes that nearly every law student undergoes. The author's description of the personal costs is a bit overdone at points - I at least have not observed such profound personality changes in any of my classmates - but the basic concept is sound. An entertaining and informative book."
5,very good product,"I have been buying this product for years now, in my case it is meant for rabbits. It works very well to prevent blockages in the intestines."
5,Vital to anyway using web-info!,"This is an important collection of articles, written by people who have been leaders in analyzing information retrieval and content well before there was a web. This is an eye-openereven for other experienced information professionals but it is especially important for people who are relying on the web as their source of personnel and professional information.Rather than scaring folks from using the web, this book is an incredibly useful tool in helping individuals, other researchers, teachers, and business people to use the web more effectively.Thanks to Anne Mintz and her colleagues for publishing this book and thanks to her employer for supporting her efforts in making us all more responsbile users of web information."
5,A most important book of the Cyber Age,"""Web of Deception"" is a wake-up call to adult on-line users of the Internet and arguably the most important book of the Cyber Age to date. Its focus is on the deliberate deceptions on the Net that can wreak havok on your health, privacy, investments, purchases, business decisions, and legal affairs.Editor Mintz and her collegial experts wrote the book not to scare but to empower Internet users to take control. ""Web of Deception"" should be required reading for Internet users and in all computer classes. It can also be a valuable text in a course on the Dark Side of the Information Age."
1,A waste of time!,"The quality of the dvd = the content! If I could give it a ZERO I would! But I can't thus 1 star. I expected some serious discussions here, with some real photos, video clips or at the very least some kind of scientific proof! Well not on this dvd do NOT be fooled by the glowing rewiews, probably written my the two people who star on this poorly recorded dvd, which lacks any substance. AMAZON should be shamed to carry such a poor product!"
4,Donald Bradshaw,"This DVD was somewhat informative in discussing how the Germans used Nikola Tesla's electrical DC ether-brush - AC inertia/gravity blocking theory in building flying machines during the 1930's and early 1940's. William Lyne was interviewed on the DVD. I have since ordered his book, entitled Pentagon Aliens, from Amazon which goes more in depth on this topic."
2,Not Convinced!,"Two flaws:1- Watt-hour meters are not generators that capture energy from the heavens! They are special motors designed to turn when real power is consumed. However, reactive power consumed will not register on these meters, and this causes the misconception.2- Conservation of energy prevents defying gravity without putting an equal amount of energy! If something is lifted up high in the air it will acquire potential energy. This potential energy must come from somewhere. Tesla coils don't consume enough electrical energy to justify the operation of UFOs. Check (EVIDENCE-the case for NASA UFOs) for a more plausible explanation.I give this program two stars instead of one just for the possibility of man possessing UFO technology."
2,Kylie Insulting,"To call this album of cover versions a tribute to Kylie is misleading. The word ""insult"" seems far more appropriate. The songs chosen (from Kylie's Stock/Aitken/Waterman days) are all pop gems, but the treatment they're given here is appalling: cheap production and inept singing are the hallmarks of this disc. However, diehard Kylie fans will want this CD for its collectable value and some might get a laugh from the doctored photo on the inside sleeve which shows a naked ""Kylie"" wearing nothing but a pout and a hat."
1,Words can not describe...,"Words can not describe how awful this CD is. On a scale of1 to 10 this one scores a minus 6!! The reason why you willfind 1 star with this review is because this is the minimumyou must give before you can write a review.It may be clear that this CD however does not deserve any star.Do not waste your money or your time on this CD. (I am beingkind, trust me). If you are so unfortunate that you alreadybought this CD perform some VooDoo on it. Maybe it will hurtthe artists.You wonder of course how I got it. Well it was send to meby mistake by a mail ordering service.You have been warned!! Everything changes ofcourse if you havea strong dislike for your mother in law or little sister.This could be a perfect Christmas gift for them...They willavoid you for the rest of your life."
1,Be kind to the people who love Kylie,It was great the end You are all just jealous that noone has done a tribute album to you - at least good 'ole Aussie Kyles has made spaces in peoples lives and stuff and yeah
3,Another sing-along,"This, I believe, is the third compilation video of Thomas music videos. Usually, I like music videos but these ones weren't nearly as good. They just aren't very catchy, in fact, the only one I liked was ODE TO GORDON. On the other hand, both of the stories(THOMAS AND THE TUBA, THOMAS AND THE FIREWORKS DISPLAY) are good. No I wouldn't recommend this video, only if your a true Thomas fan."
5,Great for Autistic Child.,My son has autism and he watches Songs from the Station all the time. He loves Thomas. I wish that they would put out more original Thomas songs on dvd! All Thomas songs are great because he wants to get through the stories to get to them! Thomas Sing Along Songs dvd is also great.
3,Bad Menu,"My 2 year old son loves this DVD. That is after getting it started. It has the worst menu. You have no power as to escaping it. It is boring. You just have to wait till it is over, no matter what button you push on your remote. But, the songs are great ;)"
5,"WOW! A SILVER PERCY AND A GREAT, GREAT VIDEO!!!","I CAN'T WAIT FOR THIS VIDEO BECAUSE I WANT THE SILVER PERCY!!!!! I already have the GOLDEN THOMAS that came with Thomas' Sodor Celebration!, but I want the SILVER PERCY so I can complete my collection.THE EPISODES ARE:Thomas and the FireworksThomas and the TubaTHE SONGS ARE:Ode to GordonPatience is a VirtueEngine Role CallAll Aboard with Thomasand more...Running Time Approx. 40 MinutesDVD Running Time Approx. 126 Minutes (if you add the bonus features)."
1,Well whaddaya know -- $cientologists at it again,"Let's face it -- Hubbard was a piss-poor scifi writer, capable only of coming up with his own crackpot, moonbat religion.He didn't write this. He's been dead for years.Find something better, people. ANYTHING will do."
5,"Blues, Sex and the Broken Heart; a personal Story","There are some great books on blues out there, but The Blues Alive brings it home to roost in our gut and soul. This is an amazing synthesis of history and anthropology with the personal story of how playing the blues has influenced the author's life. From Flamenco and Gypsy, to African tribal and even Baul music of Bengal, Mr. Flaherty circles the globe and brings us passionate descriptions of how music has been used to express the broken heart and our search for peace within that condition. Spirituality and sexuality have played major roles in all these genres and the book holds nothing back when exploring these topics. An excellent addition (or beginning) for any blues library."
5,Great Watch,"I have owned this watch for over 5 years and worn it almost everyday as a college student. I have never had a problem with the solar power and I do not spend an extraordinary amount of time outside, so there is nothing to worry about on that front. It is a great casual watch that can be worn with almost anything (maybe not black tie). I have replaced the band once but only because the ringlets that keep the band together broke off. I highly recommend this watch if you want something stylish and comfortable without being too outlandish."
2,"Love the watch, band is terrible","I've had this watch a couple years and the watchband already broke. I'm looking for a replacement and it's looking like it'll cost me about 50 bucks. The strap is comfortable, but not strong at all. I'd have gotten a watch with a better strap if I had it to do over again."
5,My Eco-Drive experience..,"I have four Citizen Eco-Drive watches: two titanium, a Skyhawk and a Perpetual Calendar, a 300M Professional Diver, and a Calibre 6000 dress watch; listed from oldest (4 years) to newest (3 days). I have never had a single moment's problem from any of the older watches (the Perpetual Calendar is a year old). I've recommended them to friends and coworkers, and have had several buy them (and thank me afterward).The advantage of not having to replace batteries every year or two is just a bonus to these watches. They are very accurate and very attractive.I like to joke that if the sun were to die tomorrow, and all life on Earth with it, my Skyhawk would still be keeping time for 9 months.. :-)I highly recommend these watches."
3,"excellent watch, lousy band","Excellent watch, could not speak higher of it. Titanium body makes it light, but tough. Never need to change batteries. Very precise time piece. Looks great. Markings and hands glow very brightly in the dark. Withstands water exposure when swimming, i did not try diving with it. But just like some other reviews say, the band lasts exactly 2.5 years and cracks. Replacement band costs whopping $45 because it is a custom fitted band. Which brigs me to the main point about the ""Eco friendliness"" of the thing. If i do not get replacement batteries but replace a band every 2.5 years, what is the point. Shame on Citizen for not addressing this. I will not be replacing the band this time, rather get another eco-drive watch with more of a standard band that can be obtained easy."
2,Don't buy this watch! The band does NOT last very long,"I bought this watch based on its good looks and Citizen's excellent reputation. Unfortunately, I didn't realize that the band only last about a year. I've replaced the band twice (at roughly $50.- a piece!) and I'm done! Only a Citizen band works with this watch and you basically have to mail it to Citizen to get it replaced. The first time I had them send me a band, figuring I could replace it myself. I ended up bringing it to the local jeweler/watch store and paying them to put it on the watch! I don't know why Citizen chose to use this ""cheap"" and inferior band, when other manufacturers can find high quality, lasting rubber watchbands. The rubber band on my Polar Heart Rate monitor watch has lasted 5 times longer than the Citizen band and shows no signs of wear, despite always being exposed to sweat. I like Citizen watches in general but I will look for a watch that will accept a generic leather band or one with a metal watchband."
3,Citizen BM8290 watch band,"I curently own the Citizen BM8290-05e watch and the only thing I have against this watch is that the rubber watch band broke and I can't find another. I have been going crazy looking for a new band to fit this watch and it seems the only place to get it is from Citizen for $50. I will not pay that for a 6 inch piece of rubber that is going to break again. So that being said, I will probably not buy another Citizen watch again. Guess I'll start wearing my TAG as my every day watch."
2,"Watch OK, but band breaks and is expensive to replace","I have had this watch for about 3 years and mostly it's a good watch.Good:Doesn't need batteryKeeps good timeNot too heavyEasy to see at nightBad:Difficult to set month when month has only 30 daysBand broke after 3 years. Costs $50.00 to replace.Warranty is misleading in that it would appear that the band is covered for 5 years, but a close reading shows that it's not. A watch like this should be guaranteed, period.I would not buy this watch again because of the band issue."
5,Great value for the price,The rechargeable battery technology is pretty advanced I must say. Now I don't have to worry about buying batteries for a long time until this one can't hold charge anymore. Amazon did have the lowest price.
3,Disappointed,"The CD contains all the information that is stated on the cover. But the structure of the content is difficult to use. Things are repeated but not directly after they have been said and there are no pauses to allow you to reapeat the words or phrases e.g.One, two, three, fourOne, two, three, fourRather thanOne, pause, one, pauseTwo, pause, two, pauseAlthough it is not ideal I have used the CD and I am now able to mumble a few words of Polish. So the produces of the CD could argue that it did what it was designed to do."
5,Sonata! Sonata! Sonata!,This collection of sonatas by Beethoven is excellent. Mr. Rubenstein does an excellent job of rendering the mood of all of these songs from Moonlight Sonata to Pathetique. Many praises to both.
4,Good Easy Soup,"We really enjoyed this soup.The flavor is very good and I like that it makes a decent amount.However, we both experienced a lot of gas after consuming it.We'll have Beano with the next batch.Great side for wraps or many other quick and easy meals."
3,Enjoyable,"I really liked Wadzilla...I thought it was funny and gross, plus I liked how it was filmed and all the news reels that were meant to look old. I didn't care for I Was a Teenage Werebear. It was too much like High School Musical with...bears. I also liked the Diary of Anne Frankenstein, and Zom-B- Movie. All in all, I'd say these three are worth seeing, but you could skip I Was a Teenage Werebear and not be missing anything."
3,I'm still gagging,"Classic sophomoric sex humor, but I am STILL gagging from the final Wadzilla frames. Of the four vignettes in this movie, ""The Diary of Anne Frankenstein"" was the boldest and most outrageous comic reinterpretation, if you can call it that, of a sacrosanct subject I've ever seen. As Zom-B-Movie descended into a gutteral orgiastic display, I ""came"" to the sad realization that I would NEVER eat movie theater popcorn again..."
1,What did I just watch?,"This is the worst movie i've ever seen. I could tell a lot of narcotics came into play during the development of the story. If you love a movie with no direction with alot of parody and tie it all up with a zombie orgy, then enjoy it by all means. But if you're the least bit sinical and require a plot or an actual storyline, then this isn't your movie."
2,A WASTE of time and money.,Save yer money! Save your time! This is NOT entertaing at all! Not worth the effort. I wouldn't even watch this mess on free TV!
1,HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT,"Chillerama consists of four one-joke sketches surrounded by a boring, atrociously-acted framing sequence.It's like a bad photocopy of a very bad 1980s horror-comedy anthology.How the filmmakers thought expressing their love for the genre by making what they made simply astonishes me.None of the movies has any kind of authentic feel, which would have been essential for a combination loving tribute and affectionate parody.""Funny"" is a very subjective thing, but the only horror to be found is the horrific beating to death of the one-joke premise in each mini-movie. ""See folks? It's a GIANT SPERM! See that? Funny, huh? A GIANT SPERM! Hilarious right? RIGHT?""Typical of modern Hollywood, where no-talent idiots pay tribute to things they grew up with by making horrible new versions that don't hold a candle to the originals."
1,Um... seriously... what is this?,Is this for real? Because I was grossed out... then I felt stupid for watching this. The only parts I enjoyed were the in betweens. This one really isn't that good.
5,LOVED IT!!!,"If you like the old cheesy drive-in movies from the 60s and 70s and total B-Horror movies, you will love this tribute. This is an anthology movie with 4 mini movies in it. Each movie is a great twist on some older drive-in movie plots and hilarious. I'm so glad I bought this movie, I will be watching it many times and showing it to friends when they come over for movie nights."
3,Divertida,"En una sola trama unen 4 cortos dirigidos por personas diferentes. La propuesta es interesante y estéticamente tiene muchos de los valores que se aprecian en una Midnight movie. Creo que igual tiene altibajos y a veces raya en una estupidez innecesaria, que la vuelve aburrida. El primer corto es muy divertido."
5,Geology Dictionaries,These were very appreciated by the Guatemalan students who got them as a token of our appreciation. They find them very useful.
1,terrible cheap knock-off,"From someone who owns around 70 blurays, these cases are a joke. they're so boxy, they are literally smaller-scale standard dvd cases. They look like a sore thumb sitting in my collection."
3,"Some good tracks, not their best stuff","The title song has a trivial character and is done in a mostly silly way. A little silliness is good, but I wouldn't have made it the first song.I was looking forward to their rendition of Kurt Weill's ""My Romance"" but it was uninspiring.Good tracks:* Those Days Are Gone* Who Is Sylvia?* All I Ask Of You* Plaisir D'Amour* Phyllis Is My Only JoyPretty good tracks:* I Get Along Without You Very Well* Lydia* Down With Love(This is largely pasted from my review on my blog, [...])"
1,if this is black belt ...,"Don't be fooled by the title - if you are looking for challenging Sudoku puzzles, this is not the book for you."
3,Not really Black Belt...,"..but more of a medium gray. If you are looking for ""Fiendish"" or ""Tough"" puzzles, you will be bored here."
1,WAY too easy,"Apparently ANYONE can get a black belt if this book is any indication. The 21st puzzle I solved completely by inspection, didn't write ANY number possibilities in at all, which is totally unacceptable for an allegedly hard level sudoku book. If you enjoy challenging sudoku puzzles skip over this book. The Second Degree Brown Belt book was more challenging, though by far my favorite Sudoku book to date is ""Sudoku Genius"" by Tom Sheldon ISBN 0-452-28750-2."
2,Another disappointed solver!,"Let me add my name to the long list of disappointed sudoku lovers looking for a fiendish challenge!On the plus side, a nicely bound book with good quality paper that is very friendly to a pencil and eraser. But the book simply fails to live up to its billing as a collection of ""super tough"" puzzles.If you're an accomplished sudoku fan, looking for a tougher nut to crack, this certainly isn't going to be your pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.Not recommended.Paul Weiss"
2,"So easy and predictable, it's monotonous","Although this book is titled ""Black Belt"", the puzzles are equivalent to my daily paper's easy or medium puzzles. All 300 puzzles use the same basic logic rule and many have the same layout so that they actually become monotonous instead of challenging or even interesting. Many of the logic rules typically used to solve difficult puzzles are not even used here. Definitely a disappointment."
1,Too easy,This is a horrible book to buy if you want challenging sudoku puzzles. There are 300 puzzles and the first 100 averaged less than 15 minutea apiece for me to complete. #102 and #103 took me 8 and 7 minutes. Too easy. Black belt is a deceptive title.
1,Not the real McCoy,"At best this is novice level. To claim that the puzzles ""will provide a sly, absorbing test for even the best most proficient experts"" is misleading in the extreme. I would rate myself as ""Competent"" and yet have not been challenged by any of the puzzles so far. I am only up to puzzle number 26, so maybe the challenges are yet to come.Black Belt Sudoku (Martial Arts Sudoku)"
2,Skip this one,"This book is much easier than brown belt, level 3. Skip it and go to black belt, level 2."
1,Pedestrian,"Maybe I shouldn't have expected much for $6.95. When something advances itself as ""Super-Tough,"" you'd think the hardest puzzle might take more than 5 minutes. In about an hour's work, I did the first 12 and the last 3, hoping the ones at the end might provide more of a challenge. I was wrong.The only reasonable explanation is that an editor mislabeled a White Belt Sudoku volume. The toughest puzzles still require only two or three of the basic tricks a beginner or early intermediate solver might have recently learned. If you've done more than a few dozen puzzles before opening this book, no penciling, inferences, or memory tricks will be required. Seek such stimulation elsewhere. Anything edited by Will Shortz, among others, will provide dramatically better bang for the buck."
2,"Probably worth it, but I only paid a buck...","Better than most of the Dollar Store books, but not as demanding as I expected. I hope I get another 'The Original Sudoku Calendar' (Workman publishing). Their Saturday puzzles were consistently challenging, but solvable. This book is about on a par with their medium puzzles (Thurs and Friday).Of course, this is not the place to start, and it is also not for the vet looking for a challenge. Maybe good practice for someone bored with the easy puzzles, but wants to learn some new tricks."
3,Definitely NOT 'Black Belt',"I have worked many many other Sudoku puzzles that are much more challenging than the ones in this book, though I've worked easier as well. I would say these are just middle-of-the-road in difficulty, which makes the title extremely misleading.If you love working all types of logic puzzles and are looking for a fantastic challenge, try Dave Tuller's Mensa Challenge Your Brain Math & Logic Puzzles. They were great!"
2,"Too easy to claim a ""Black Belt"" title","I was looking for a challenging book and the booked looked promising as the book cover rated the ""super tough"" and the back says it will test even the best, most proficient experts"" NOT!!!I would give the puzzles a ""moderate"" rating and the difficulty does not increase toward the end of the book which was disappointing. I did improve my solving speed and honed my pattern recognition skills but did not encounter or require any of the more advanced solving techniques."
1,Yawn...,A black belt in who's dojo ???? A total waste of money if you are looking for challenging Sudoku.
4,Great infant toy/organizer,"I bought this toy organizer for my 8-month old son. It holds A LOT of toys, and is very convenient for travel. With its bright colors and peek-a-boo flaps, it also serves as a toy in itself. My only complaint is that it came rather smashed into a box and still hasn't quite regained it's shape. Great gift idea."
5,"What a combo Supercat,Mary J. Blige,P.Diddy",and The Notorious B.I.G. (Biggie Smalls). This was the first Bad Boy record. It is as tight today as it was in 1993. A Historic Reggae and Hip-Hop collaboration.
2,Highly Overrated,"Some say you should give a book fifty pages to interest you, and if nothing happens, give up. At page 100, I'm still not interested, but I haven't given up. The first fifty pages were amazingly dull. So far, I'm not happy I didn't give up. If my opinion changes before the end (if I get to the end), I'll revise this review."
4,My boyfriend loved it,"Very sexy, was shipped very quickly, size fit me fine. couldnt beat the price, fabric wasnt very comfortable, but its not ment to be worn for long lol."
3,"Great artwork, contrived story","I love love love the illustrations of this book. They're so full of colour, movement and personality. Lots of kid appeal! However, I feel that the artwork is its strongest point. While I appreciated the value in the repetition and the rhyming, I found the story and the rhyme itself very contrived. I felt as if the author was trying too hard to get the rhyme to fit neatly and compactly into the almost 30 pages that the story rests on.That said, my 3 year old daughter loves this book and whenever she asks me to read it, I have to do so several times before I manage to redirect her attention towards a different book. She laughs hysterically whenever we get to the part where the flea sneezes. That reaction must count for something and probably has more merit than the opinion of her cranky mommy."
4,Huge size,"The poetry is delightful, the pictures are great, but please note that this book is HUGE! The dimensions clearly show it's roughly 17 inches by 17 inches, but I apparently didn't notice that when purchasing."
3,Meh.,"This book is very similar in theme to The Napping House. As such, I can't help but compare the two. And when I do, this one is definitely the loser.It's not really such a bad book, I guess. The repetitive rhymes are a little long. There are a few non sequiturs - the sneeze wakes them up, and then the bat is baffled so his eyes turn blue? It reminds the frog of his old nephew? (Worse, this is clearly just to fit the -oo rhyme scheme, meaning you have to say ""old nephEW"" with the stress on the last syllable.) In some books this randomness is quirky and fun. In this one, it just hits me as weird and nonsensical."
3,Forced Rhymes but Great Pictures,"A funny little tale about a flea that creates and uproar in a barn. Younger children will really get into the repetitive text and the illustrations are really wonderful. The story itself is funny enough, if a little subtle.However, the rhymes here are sometimes a little bizarre. It seems to me that if the author couldn't think of something for the bat to do besides have his ""eyes turned blue,"" then maybe the bat didn't need to be in the barn. That goes double for the frog. While other animals cry, ""Boo Hoo,"" or ""Eww!"" or (duh), ""Moo! Moo!"" what is the reaction of the frog? He is ""reminded... of his old nephew."" What?In any case, it is a cute enough story and your toddler will care a lot less than you will about the textual oddities, and will really enjoy the menagerie depicted on the pages."
1,2 DOAs,"BOTH CDs contained tracks with 1 or 2 seconds of static in them. I sent it back for a new one, and the new one ALSO has static in some of the tracks. Completely unacceptable!"
3,The soundtrack sounds too cut and pasted!,"I had to purchase this soundtrack because I had done so with the original's 2-disc release during the 1997 Special Editions. While those compilations were something to listen to over and over again, Episode 1's falls a little shorter than what I could listen to on continuous loop. There are some tracks that definitely sound cut, and other areas where the music begins to build up your excitement, only to drop you down and build you up again (such as the area near the end when the Queen and all her staff are infiltrating the palace). There are several little interior tracks that work well, but others that seem to falter. The opening tracks where the Jedi dock in the Neimodian ship seem mysterious, but somewhat hastily assembled."
3,Should Have Been Released Back In '99,"Why wasn't this version of the Star Wars Episode I soundtrack released along with the film back in May of 99? Could it have possibly been this kind of thinking? ""Say, lets get them to by the single soundtrack, then after awhile we can release an 'Ultimate Edition' and sell even more copies."" Well, this is definately a better soundtrack than the original release. I like the fact that the music is in order of the film. It gives the album a sense of flow that was missing in the original release. There are some bad points, however. The dialogue version of Duel Of The Fates is nausiating at best. Also, we don't get the film version of the parade or end credits. If you are a Star Wars fan who has to own every piece of music available, by all means purchase this."
4,The Definitive Star Wars Episode I Film Score,"John Williams' latest ""Star Wars"" film score is a splendid mix of both the old and new, in which he intriguingly blends choral and orchestral music in several sections of the score. By far the best segment of the soundtrack is ""Duel Of The Fates"". I am quite impressed with Williams' complex orchestral textures throughout the score; certainly it is among his most elaborate compositons for film. And yet, I did not find it nearly as memorable or as compelling a score as those he's composed for ""Empire Strikes Back"" or ""Schindler's List"". Still this receives a highly favorable recommendation from me to fans of ""Star Wars"" and John Williams' film music. Of course, it is brilliantly performed by the London Symphony Orchestra."
5,Fabulous!,"It's great to hear music that was not released on the original CD. Some tracks are moving, some haunting and others are pure action. John Williams is a Jedi Maestro! You can just ""see"" the movie when listening to the music. You can be on a bus, at work, etc ... and just see Queen Amidala stand up to the Trade Federation, the lightsabre battle ...A pity they put Darth Maul on the cover :(Oh well, I just stuck Qui-Gon over him! :)"
5,"Lo mejor, la música","Sin lugar a dudas, este CD doble es largamente mejor que la pelicula. Con piezas nunca antes escuchadas, la música de la Amenaza Fantasma es una prueba más de que John Williams sigue vigente en el negocio de las peliculas, y espero que siga por mucho tiempo más."
5,"Awesome, but what about the same treatment for AOTC?","If you have a soft spot in your heart for the music from the overly-maligned Episode I, this is the CD set you want. I've owned both CDs, but this terrific set blows the other out of the water. It makes me wish more record companies put out these kinds of sets.That said, we've got the definitive soundtracks for Episodes I, IV, V and VI. So where's Episode II? Come on, Sony!"
2,"A promising item, but disappointing.","A good, decent score by John Williams. Some of his recent work isn't quite as great as his older stuff; classics like Star Wars, Jaws, and Raiders of the Lost Ark. But, this is still a great soundtrack, nonetheless. The Duel of the Fates is worth it alone. What I like most is that every single piece of music from the film is here. I feel that I'm often annoyed with other soundtracks that omit random tracks for whatever reason. Not the case here. It's all there.Buyer beware, however, as this product is flawed. It took me two purchases and a little research to discover that every unit of this product has a gliche where discs skip. So, know that it's not just your particular item or the CD player. I'm not really sure why they would put a defected product on store shelves, and for a high price. So, if you're not too picky about having the soundtrack in its entirety, you might be better off getting the original edition instead."
2,BUYER BEWARE READ THIS,As another reviewer stated this release has several glitched spots on the disc where it suddenly emits a LOUD pink noise. Bugged me so bad the first time I purchased the CD again.... just to discover it's a faulty recording.The music is so good!!! But the glitching (at least 12 different places) is annoying enough to make it not enjoyable. It seems they didn't always sell these flawed discs? Can't imagine them being this way since the release 9 years ago.
4,"Small plate, big rewards","My daughter in law wanted these luncheon plates for her own use. I have loved the smaller plates for most of my eating. It is important when watching our intake to use smaller plates and these smaller plates are great! They are smaller so the plate looks full sooner and I usually eat less.The pattern complements the original set. They have more pattern, so they look great on the place setting on top of the dinner plate when used for salad in a more formal setting (but it is Corelle, so not usually used for formal meals.)"
3,Not the best dinosaur excavation kits available.,"The GeoSafari kits are the more educational of the dinosaur excavation kits, providing a booklet with fun facts and projects as you excavate and assemble your dinosaur. It is also the least messy, with the bones packed in clay. Unfortunately these are the only advantages over other kits you could by. The excavation tools provided ensure that it will take a long while to get to the bones. And the bones don't snap into each other like other kits. Instead, you use wax to hold them in place. The wax is messy but is supposed to allow for movement if you want to put your dinosaur in different poses. Unfortunately what you wind up having is a skeleton that falls apart easily.For the same type of kits I'd go with the EduScience brand."
2,"Too much analysis, not enough biography","For a book in a series of biographies, I got this book expecting just that. Instead I found out only a little about one of my favorite authors, instead being overloaded with critical analysis. Many times Mikkelsen simply judges part of Cooper's work as good or bad with little explanation as to her judgements. Some of her analysis was good and the summaries of Cooper's works were useful, but I believe she did a bit too much analysis. Many times she read into scenes ideas that I did not think Cooper intended, often subjecting the writings to various critical approaches with little regard as to what Ms. Cooper meant when she wrote those scenes. It was just like my high school English classes - overanalyzation (sp?) without any thought of what the writer originally meant or what the average reader will get out of it. Less analysis and more biographical information would have been more pleasing to me."
3,"Wrong book in ""Look Inside""","I'm sure the book ""Monet: the ultimate impressionist"" is quite good, but when you click on ""look inside"" it takes you to look inside a ""Homeric Questions"" book and not the one about Monet."
2,Too Technical - Hardly Practical,"This thick book is filled with ALOT of technical terms and references to things that I will never do with my home movies. If you just want to learn some basic techniques for shooting better home videos, skip this book. The advice is not very practical. For instance, I wanted to know step-by-step how to take better shots, not ""avoid panning too much."" Still there is some useful information. But if all you want to do is make better home movies, check out John Fuller's Make Fantastic Home Videos. In a short amount of time, he tells you exactly how to shoot home movies just like the pros do it. It is just a much more practical book and not quite as ""theory oriented"" as this one."
3,read this before buying a camcorder,"So much of this book is dedicated to equipment, I would recommend buying this book before buying any equipment. I only gave this book a ""3"" because it covers more theory than practical information. For instance, Chapter 24 ""Multimedia Madness: Alternative Methods of Distributing Your Video"" mentions that you should ""choose a codec (compression/decompression) scheme."" Then it moves on with out going in to some of the pro/cons of even the most popular formats."
4,watch,I like this watch because of the battery life that can save me a lot of money. I had this kind of watch since 2007.
3,A bit bulky and not the quality I expected.,"Bought this watch for my brother in law. First off you have to know how to adjust the strap yourself or your gonna have to take it to the watch shop( more $$$)You will need one of those small screw driver sets to push out the pins, take off some links and adjust the length of the SS bracelet. The watch was a bit bulky for my taste and did not ooze of quality but you get what you pay for. Tricky to set up so put on those magnifying glasses and read the tiny manual(belongs in a doll house)So far my brother in law has not destroyed it(and he will) but for the 17 odd bucks I paid, I'll buy him another from Amazon.The data bank is a plus as is the ten year battery and dual time zone.Will update this review as we go along."
5,Great quality for the price,My first impression was surprised. It looks very expensive but was not. It was a gift which was much appreciated!
1,battery died in 5 months DO NOT BUY,What can I say...after putting up with the negatives (in other reviews)...my watch battery died after 5 months ? So much for 10year battery...ha ha. Will stay away from cheap Casio.Update: Changed battery...died again in 3 months. This watch is worthless. DO NOT BUY THIS. 01 April 2012.
1,Band broke in 6 days,Casio wants $17 to fix a $20 watch. Who wants to order another one that may break in a week? We are telling them to keep the watch.
1,Junk,"Bought this in September 2012. Broken in December 2012. Light stays on, Hands don't move. Display is blank. Don't waste your money"
1,Complicated watch,Nice looking watch but I need to replace it because the thick INSTRUCTION book is required to make very complicated changes required for simple time changes. Two watches in one (analog and digital)and each require the instruction book. I will soon replace this watch and then THROW IT AWAY!
1,Description Inaccurate,"I bought this watch because of its price (too good to be true--and it turns out it was too good to be true) AND its description that says it was supposed to have a stainless case.Not so. The case is resin, and sure enough after two months, the case failed where the band attaches and I have no more watch.A call to the Casio warranty agent, Time Machine, revealed that the case has no warranty whatsoever. Not even two months.I am sure Amazon relies on the manufacturer to tell the truth about their product, but Casio sure misleads the buyer on this one.No more Casios for me unless they start telling the truth in the descriptions."
4,strap adjustment,On the newer model I received the only trick to removing a link was to: 1)pry up one of the links with an arrow on it to about 45 degrees2)slide out that undesired link (repeat to take out more then one)3)pry up another link with an arrow and reattach the strap.Overall really easy and much better then spending the $10-$20 the watch shops wanted for the adjustmentOverall happy with the watch- a very solid 4 stars.
3,Casio watch,"The watch looks nice, but I found it more complicated than I wanted and hard to read without the bottom hour digits. Also there are no instructions on how to adjust the band, so you have to figure it out by trial and error. All I want is a simple good looking decent cheap watch."
3,"good price, would try something else next time","Good item at a very good Amazon price - $16. But: Band very hard to adjust without a professional. No directions how to in the manual! unnecessary phone number feature. lighting woefully inadequate.after a year: they were right; the glass gets scratched easily. i can still see, but it's annoying. also, the hands block the digital screen when they're pointing down; i'd rather an analog/digital which doesn't block, and one which has a light that really works!"
4,"Great looking, hard to set up","I bought this watch last december. Very nice looking and does not ""look"" its price. I took away a star because it's very easy to scratch. There's a very easy solution, though: just damp a soft cloth, put a little toothpaste on it, and clean it using circular motions...good as new. Very nice so far!!!"
1,Cheap plastic and quality,"This watch should be sold for $1 for the kind of design and glass they put on the watch. Who would put a cheap plastic that invites scratches.. yes, it likes scratches.. because it has this convex shape or a bulge protruding outside because of which no one can avoid getting scratches on the glass/plastic. Very badly designed watch. Did not expect this from Casio. And when I returned the watch, I got only half the amount I paid. Extremely unhappy with Amazon also that puts up these kind of watches in-spite of so many negative reviews.I actually got a very nice watch for $10 from Walmart about 6 years ago that I used extensively for 3 years and now carry it as a back-up that performed so good. The glass is pretty scratch resistant with heavy metal rim and cotton webbing belt. The glass is actual glass and not some cheap plastic. I would give that $10 watch 5 stars since it exceeded my expectations for the price I paid."
1,Convoluted..,"The watch is large, unwieldy and difficult to use. These negative characteristics would be minimally acceptable IF you were able to read the 3-point type in which the manual is printed. It's nearly impossible to manipulate the controls, read the manual while holding a magnifying glass, while trying to decipher what the words want you to accomplish. I sent it back after two days and only suffered the loss of $4.95 shipping costs. Go for something easier to use."
2,a little disapoint,"I bought 4 watches,but only 3 work well.I have already leave USA,and I don't know what to do."
1,Too easily scratched,"I've had this watch for a few months now - bottom line, avoid.Pros: light weight, can track two time zones, date, alarm/snooze, timer.Cons: easily scratch - on this alone, I give it a 1 star, there are now 3 scratches on the watch face without me, and I wore this mostly to/from work. Light is useless as it's not bright enough to see the whole watch.I thought I got a bargain. However, after this, I am going back to Citizen/Seiko. The scratched up watch face just annoys me."
1,I did not get bought watch still,I greetI did not get bought watch stillI do not know how I have to wait longI ask to send me this watch
3,Por el precio esta bien,"Saludos,El reloj a nivel de funciones esta muy completo, tiene dos temporizadores uno acumulativo y otro cuenta atras, hora mundial. 2 alarmas, y tiene memoria para 30 numeros de telefono, es bastante liviano.Ahora lo que no me gusto fue:el case es plastico con recubrimiento de aluminio. el cristal se raya rapido. con cualquier leve golpe. la iluminacion es insuficiente debido a que son dos led amarillos y no alcanza a iluminar la pantalla lcd. solo las agujas.si no eres muy exigente y quieres algo economico y funcional este es, en ese caso un buen reloj. teniendo en cuenta estos detalles.saludos."
2,Settings difficult.,"Gave this to my husband (who is very skilled with understanding instructions) who had a very hard time setting this watch. The instruction booklet was hard to follow and written in the tiniest print. After hours of working on this product, he finally got some results although the watch is five minutes fast....he wasn't going to spend anymore time on this. I expected more from Casio"
2,adjustments,"cost will be 15.00 to get band adjusted to my wrist, thats almost as much as i paid for the watch"
2,"The watch is plastic, band is metal","I like Casio and have always had one (since the 80's) so I bought this one as a watch I could wear to work and not looks like I just came from a workout. Turns out the main watch body is plastic, and more than that, it is made of several parts glued together (not even one solid piece like I expected) As other say, you cannot read the digital display at night and even the hands are not that well lit. It is not an Illuminator light, just a plain old tiny bulb. I guess for $20 I should not expect much but I think next time I will spend a little more and go for a real metal watch. The old thing I can say I like is that the band is metal and does not have that little plastic end of the sports watch that keeps coming out of that ""keeper band"". It took minor surgery to adjust this band, removing links, etc."
5,Wonderful birthday gift.,"I bought this for my boyfriend as a birthday gift and, although he is very picky about jewelry, he absolutely loves this watch. I would definitely recommend it."
3,Fine for the price,"This watch is fine for the sub twenty dollar price tag. Casio really needs to develop an Indiglo type lighting. The light is almost useless.The crystal face is far inferior to the tempered sapphire protecting the watch face on my ""good"" watch, but it is around three hundered dollars. The Casio watch face has aquired several scratches by daily use. All that is expected for the cost. One misleading item is that the description states a stainless steal bezel. It is stainless colored plastic. For that I give the item only three stars."
4,Nice looking watch but bit complicated setting,"I bought this watch for my hubby. It came within a week well packed.He just started to use it. Not sure about the battery life yet.It looks nice. The face is plastic but for the price, I'd say it is fair.However, the setting is bit complicated. You can work it out if you go through the instruction and pressing this button 6 or 5 times... etc.One more thing is the band coming with serious scratches over one bit. Since the other bit looks fine, I assume it just damaged from the assembly."
4,Excellent Everyday Watch,"I bought the Casio AW80D-1AV to replace an aging Timex Indiglo Watch. I am genuinely happy with the purchase. I agree with some reviewers that it takes a little time to figure out how to set the watch but my patience was rewarded and I figured it out. Setting the Casio really isn't any more complex than setting the Timex; just a different sequence of button pushing.I found the backlight to be more than sufficient, unlike some reviewers. It should be noted that frequent use of the backlight diminishes the duration of battery life but the watch takes a standard battery so replacement expense is not going to be prohibitive when the current one runs down.This is a good looking, functional watch with lots of features at an amazing price point. You really can't go wrong with the the AW80D. My only wish is that they made a women's model because my wife is really impressed with the watch."
4,nice looking,"GOOD LOOKING EVERY DAY WATCH.EASY TO SET UP.A LOT OF FEATURES,SOME OF WHICH I MAY NEVER USE.BACKLIT FACE COULD BE BRIGHTER.OVER ALL A GOOD VALUE.AS USUAL,SHIPPING WAS SUPER FAST AND ARRIVED IN PERFECT CONDITION.WOULD BUY ANOTHER."
4,Good Watch!,"Very well built watch. Wish it had more than 4 pins to choose from on the band to adjust the size, but that goes along with me finding the right size for my wrist! Great watch though!"
1,Case is part cheap plactic,Although this watch looks metal it is not. The band is and the back is but a good portion of the case is plastic covered with a cheap silver decorative piece. The decorative piece fell off in a month (had to glue it back on) and after another few months the prong on the case that holds the pin to secure the band completely broke off = cheap plastic.
2,Flimsy Watch/Complicated to Set,"I bought this watch in search of a nice metal sports watch under $20. It looks very nice but, it is made of a cheap metal coated with a shiny plastic. The band bends easily and becomes misshaped and pinches your skin and is very uncomfortable and has no way to adjust to your own hand size. Inside the watch was a complicated setting system where you had to hold a button for 10 minutes to set the digital time then do it again to set the analog time. This process was extremely time consuming and tedious. I do not recommend purchasing this watch for all of the above reasons. So far it has been imposible for me to find a good metal sports watch under $20."
3,Good watch for the price,"I didn't like its big dial. If you have a thin wrist like mine, probably you'd not like to own it. However it is one of the best watches you can get in this price considering its functionality and metal band."
1,Unreliable,"I got this watch in March 2011 and after 1 year, it stopped working. Neither Amazon is replacing it for me nor Casio is taking any responsibility. I never expected Casio product to be such pathetic. The China Quality is showing its colour. I have decided not buy any Casio product in my life."
2,Pictures Are Decieving,"I bought this watch because I liked the idea of having a dual analog/digital watch. The default picture on amazon isn't perfectly accurate to what the watch looks like in real life. The buttons are all light grey and not black. The watch is pretty small as well. I regret buying this watch now, it doesn't look nearly as good as the picture and it's also too big for my wrist, even with adjustments. The next time I purchase a watch will definitely be in a store where I can see what the watch actually looks like."
3,"Nice watch, but a 10 month (not 10 year) battery","I really like(d) this watch. Looks nice for the money, but the battery died after 10 months and who wants to got through the hassle of trying to get warranty service on a [...] watch? Might buy another anyway."
2,Bad band,I try more so to find watches that fit and this watch stated my size but with the type of band it has it was to small so I gave it to my son.
2,"Nice watch, difficult band","The band on this watch must be adjustable downward--it is too big for my wrist--but I can't find instructions for removing links and can't figure out how to do it on my own. Too bad, because the watch seems quite useful otherwise. I had to take it to a watch repair shop and spend at least as much as the purchase price to have the band adjusted."
5,Two Thumbs Up!!,"Ive been using this watch for over two months everyday. Its great for a backup watch or for everyday rough use. Light, durable and neat looking. Has tons of options like a backlight display, stopwatch, timer, telephone book and world time, water resistance. What more could u ask for in a price range this small."
4,Not bad for the price!,"For the price this watch is a winner. The watch band is of nice quality stainless steel. Amazon states that the watch case is stainless, nope it's plastic. Only the case back is stainless. They also say that the crystal is mineral glass. Not true, plastic also. The watch keeps good time though, looks great, and is light weight (thanks to all the plastic). The battery life is advertised to be 10 years; if true I will never have to replace the battery, because it will out last the watch! The watch is fairly easy to set, but you may need to refer to the instructions. The digital and analog times must be set separately which is a real pain. Overall this watch is a good value for the price."
3,Good price,"good price and brand.it's a gift to my firend and he likes it. so, it's nice.the price is can be handled. but it is not good enough on its style compared with other casio's watch."
4,"Casio Watch, Execellent Buy","The watch is easy to set up and easy to read. Has more features than I thought!If looks are important to you, this watch will also fill that need. It's handsome and appears to cost much more than the selling price. I am happy with my purchase and would reccomend it to my friends."
5,A very reliable watch,I wanted to watch that I could glance at for the time and will be reliable and dependable with rough work. This one does it all - and replaces the same model I bought about 10 years ago . Highly recommended
4,"In terms of price,, it is great",The core materials that have been used in this watch are not that quality.It is overall acceptable and reliable. I recommend it for people need a good watch regardless of its name or manufacturer.
4,Decent watch for the price...,"This watch works perfectly well. However, I didn't expect what I got. I thought the watch would be more adjustable. My wrist is actually too think to wear this watch comfortably. It rotates freely around my wrist, and at first that was annoying, but I am getting used to it now. The set up took a little time. It may have been my own fault for not researching this watch better, but I expected a simple battery operated watch, and didn't realize it was analog and digital, and that I needed to set up the digital portion of the watch in order for the analog portion to operate. All in all, this is a better than average watch, especially when you consider how inexpensive it was. Next time I'll just have to do a little more homework on my end."
5,Perfect Watch,Watch is perfect and fits large wrists comfortably. Lots of features and the tiniest manual you've ever seen. Boyfriend loves it.
2,Band to short,Nice watch but the band is to short if you are over weight try MTP3036A-2AV What the size needs to be noted in the write up.
4,Just what I was looking for.,"I bought this watch to replace my Casio Wavecepter watch that kept going on the blink and then coming back. I had it for a long time and it served me well. The auto time sync with Colorado hardly ever worked; I guess I was on the border of acceptable reception. Anyway, this watch is almost the same; analog-digital, easy to read, good backlight, alarm, and stainless steel band. These are the features I definitely wanted. The only thing that I am a little disappointed with (and I kind of figured this was an issue when I bought it) is the soft plastic crown. It easily scratches. But, the watch was under $20, so I'm not too upset. Well worth the purchase. I would buy it again."
4,"good watch,good price","first time to buy Casio,looks very nice.the watch strap is not so comfortable,everything others is very good.recommend this product to you."
4,time will tell,"A great value, seems sturdy, instructions stink; the only reason it didn't get 5 stars. I purchased this because of the battery life claim so we'll see what happens"
4,Cool,"I bought and tested it, its so cool and i dont want to even use it so often. The most amazing thing was the fast delivery, set up was a bit of confusing but the manual helped me out. i sent it as a gift to a friend and he loves it so much. thank you all."
4,thank you,"thank you very much the product is what I expected, great, I will consider to buy new products in the future, bye"
3,Setup of the watch is difficult,"Setting the watch up is too complicated. Other tan that, it is OK. I would not purchase the watch if I had it to do over."
4,Good,"good quality material, the finish is of good quality, I am very pleased to have made &#8203;&#8203;this purchase, good price and value relationship"
4,Good buy!,"I like the style with a contrasting dial. It is analog and digital and its black and white.Keeps good time and at a great price. Looks and feels more expensive.However, loading additional data seems difficult. My older Casio was easier to program phone numbers and set timings.My first review."
5,good,"I bought this for my boyfriend for Valentine's Day. He says he likes it because it has a nice clean look and a lot of different functions. Also, it came in a box with a nice black stand, which I liked."
4,Bueno,"Transacción Rápida segura y confiable, buen producto y vendedor. El paquete llegó en el tiempo estimado de envío y en buen estado."
1,DO NOT BUY,"This watch was purchased on Feb 12, 2012 - and today (Sep 24, 2012) it has stopped working. The display is blank and the watch is ready for the garbage bin."
1,Bad battery.,"I bought this 6 months ago, and now it is out of battery. I hardly believe that, because they advertise 10 years battery. DISAPPOINTED"
4,"Overall, great appearance and features","As the watch band was too large for me, I had to remove one link. It was not difficult as one side of band has 7 links, the other 6. If smaller adjustment is needed, remove one of the links from the side that has 7 links, don't remove the link next to the clasp, remove the one next to it. Look at the back of the band. You will see arrows and below them, a small opening with a round raised nub. To remove a link, insert a small jeweler's type screw driver and PRESSING DOWN, at the same time push on nub in the direction of the arrow and the link will come out part of the way. It can be removed with needle nose pliers or if it's already loose enough, may be able to pull the pin out with your fingers. The watch has many great features. I highly recommend this watch, not only for its appearance but for the sheer number of outstanding features."
3,muy bonito,el reloj esta bien el unico inconveniente que le encuentro es que la luz no ilumina mucho en la noche por el resto esta bien
2,Nice design. Very cheap mineral face.,I wore this watch for only 3 days and already there are scratches and blemishes. I knew it was too good to be true. Avoid!
2,Cheap Case,I liked the features of the watch but the case was so poorly made that it broke before the pin which is supposed to be the expendable part. It didn't last 3 months and it costs more to mail it to Casio for exchange than it is worth. AVOID any Casio with a resin case!
2,Great design - died in 14 months...,"I love this watch - unfortunately I've had it for 14 months and the 10 year battery only lasted 10 months and the watch recently has been malfunctioning. The analog time is losing about 5-10 minutes and a day and the timer has been blinking out sometimes - just stops.Warranty has expired so it's not worth a dime. Too bad. It's perfect for a cheap watch that has hands, an alarm and a timer.I may even buy another one assuming that I'm just renting this for a year or two for $20..."
4,Excelent value,"Excellent watch for the price. I bouhgt it for everyday use at work (shop) and for $20 is a great value. I don't have to worry abouth scratching it since it was really cheap. I still get chronograph, alarms, etc."
3,Good One,"Good one.All the features specified are good enough to make it a good watch.Should consider this , if thinking of this price range."
2,the lines fell apart,"I got this one a few years ago, but did not review it.it looks nice, but after the first wash, the lines fell apart.I do not recommend this quilt."
3,"Pretty Quilt, however, not worth alot of $$!","I'm glad I ordered this quilt when it was $19.99. It's very thin and not worth more than that price. I also doubt that I'd choose this particular quilt in a store. It's just too cheaply made and thin to buy. However, the colors and design are pretty."
4,Women rise up,"Grassy Flats is about two women who are trying to make a go of it on a potato farm outside of the town of Grassy Flats during the Great Depression. Things go fine until the people in town discover that the women are lesbians and then the lovers find themselves shunned by everyone, especially the men who run all of the businesses. Suddenly, their credit is no good, the bank won't give them a loan and they find they've been fenced away from the necessary water. In the midst of this, two drifters, a man and his pregnant wife, come into their lives when the drifters try to steal a chicken to eat from the farm. These four find themselves in an uneasy alliance to try and get in a year's crops that will make the farm successful. True success comes when the women of the town decide to rally around the lesbians because of their own frustrations with how their husbands treat them. The end of the story is a little unsatisfying, but the book is worth the read."
3,"Grassy yes, flat no","Not as good as it could have been( maybe looking to write a sequel?). I like the way the women struck together against their husbands wishes,as well as the look at times during the depression. I know all stories can't end happily but there should be some kind of closure I really didn't see any, you might, other then that a good story and a great point of view."
5,Highly recommended!,"Whether you want to buy or to sell your antiques and collectibles on ebay, this is the book for you! Written in an easy-to-follow, one-step-at-a-time manner, Pam shares her expertise and insights for success. She includes many tips and suggestions and you'll feel confident and competent to enter this exciting marketplace!"
4,hans brinker,"I liked the book a lot, it showed a lot more wear than i thought it would be, not at all good for a child, so i had to buy a new version"
4,good book but bent bottom corner flap on cover,LLoved the book - was an elementary age - the cover was o.k. except one corner had a crease that had been bent.
1,Faulty Description,"Be careful in ordering this watch. While the description indicates that it has a stainless steel case, this is incorrect. The important part of the case--the part that holds the pins connecting the watch to the band is made of plastic. In my case this meant that it broke in about a year. Of course Casio does not warrant the case."
2,Casio Men's Ana-Digi Light Sport Watch #AQ180WD-2AV,Likes:Looks good and is comfortable once you figure out the band ajustments have a key system.Dislikes:1: Advertized as stainless case. It is mostly stainless - but the body is RESIN where it connects to band.I have had a few Casio watches and they have all broken where the band pin meets the watch.2:Very poor lighting. cannot read time at night. Usessmall fillament bulbs that do not do the job.In this day and age of LED's I am surprized Casio did not do better.3: Digital display does not light up. Cannot see with light bulbs.Why did Casio not use a backlit Digital time screen like my old Casio watch.4: Phosphorus like hands and numbers do not glow under provided light.5: No funcions like telememo store can be seen in dark.Overall:Bad desighn - very dissappointing.
5,Exelete reloj,"Exeleten reloj solo tiene partes plasticas en la caja no es completamente de acero, y el cristal es plástico, asi que cuidado con los rayones."
3,"Good watch but ""Clunky""!","The watch runs fine and for the price, OK. But first of all, very thick on your wrist - almost 1/2 in. thick (16 mm). Making the band smaller is a real challenge. Got one link out, but then needed to get second out - no way. Have tried 3 times with no luck, so walk around with slipping on wrist all the time. Will use until I get a chance to buy replacement."
1,Money talks,"this cd sucked for one it didnt even come with the origonal case, there was no pictures or anything,i feel like i was riped off, this cd isnt even that rare"
4,Rachmaninov - A Journey Home,"Take a journey to the great cities and country landscapes where Rachmaninov grew up -- Russia. Naxos videographers capture the beauty and culture that inspired Rachmaninoff to write with such emotion, passion, and romanticism. Pianist Bernd Glemser delivers a commendable performance with the Piano Concerto No. 2 in C Minor (the most popular of Rachmaninoff's compositions). However, it is the Piano Concerto No. 3 in D minor (technically more difficult than Concerto No. 2 - and gaining in popularity after the release of the movie ""Shine"") where Glemser truly shines - accompanied by some impressive visuals. If your DVD player has DTS capability - set it up accordingly, as the sound reproduction is both dynamic and spacious. No, you will not see Glemser, the orchestra (Polish National Radio Symphony Orchestra), or the conductor (Antoni Wit), but you be graced by the beauty that inspired the genius of Rachmaninoff."
2,"Great video, POOR audio","The audio of this DVD is very poor. The performance itself is too slow. The pianist are not the best Rock 2/3 players. Far from William Wolfram. Obscure orchestras which is OK if they're good. The dynamic range is much less than my other recordings. I have compared various sections with the CDs from better recordings and pianists. I cannot listen to the Naxos dvd after knowing what it should sound like.The video is well done and offers beautiful images with good production values.I suspect Naxos took an obscure, existing, poor audio recording they had access to and put it to video.I would suggest one should research the artists and orchestras before buying any of these musical journeys. I won't buy another untill I know who the performers are.I watch mine while listening to an audio CD."
1,"Be warned, this is not a live recording","BE WARNED! If you think this is a video recording of an orchestral performance, you will be sorely disappointed, as I was. It is merely a SOUNDTRACK of Rachmaninoff, with pretty travelogue visuals glued on. There are NO VISUALS OF THE ORCHESTRA AT ALL, no shots of musical craftsmanship, pianist fingers skimming over the keys, musician faces concentrating, cellist fingers sawing, lips pursed on the oboe, impassioned conductor guiding the orchestra through the moves to bring an art object into being, etc. -- nothing of that. It is merely a travelogue plus audio CD. You may as well play the CD in your car, while driving through your own visuals. For me this Naxos purchase was a total waste."
4,A definitive introduction to one of Ireland's finest,"Irish accordionist Sharon Shannon is one of the great modernizers in contemporary Celtic music... This 2-CD set greatly expands on her previous best-of collections, adding a second disc's worth of collaborations with pop, folk and country stars, including Jackson Browne, Steve Earle, Donal Lunny, Sinead O'Connor, John Prine and the late Kirsty MacColl. Shannon zips between traditional-sounding folk and boundary-pushing Celtic-fusion... She may make more conservative folk fans grumpy, but listeners looking for innovation have rallied around her for years. Regardless of where you stand on her aesthetic choices, it's hard to fault her technical expertise -- Shannon is one of the most dazzling players in Celtic music today. This is hte perfect introduction to her work."
2,A huge disappointment.,They do a version of Galway Girl with Steve Earle---that was the only good song in the two-disc set. I hoped that the double album would offer more.
5,My Desert Island Disk,"This performance of the Brahms 2 was one of the first LP's I ever purchased. That disk has resided on my shelf since 1958, since which time it has been joined by more than 10,000 others, not to mention CD's, tapes, etc. Were I able to take only one of these thousands to a desert island, it would be this one, for in it I would be able to find all that I love in music: warmth, wit, elegance and beauty. The piece has been often recorded, and justly; but no performance has, or ever will equal this. The culture which produced these two great musicians also produced Brahms, and that culture is gone forever. Anyone seeking to experience its finest qualities need look no further."
5,Superlative,"This is one of the best books I have ever read about human possibilities. I ordered another one and sent it to my best friend, and she is circulating it among other people. It is a belly laugh a page."
2,sounds like it's been dubbed from a cassette tape,"thankfully i borrowed this DVD from my local library before purchasing - the sound quality is awful! i speak cantonese, but not mandarin, and was hoping to pick up some basics with my kids. the sound quality would make it nearly impossible for anyone to hear the 4 tones used in mandarin. this fatal flaw destroys the great educational potential of this dvd series - it's hard to learn a language without hearing the words pronounced clearly. that's unfortunate, because my 6yo kids found the simple cartoons entertaining (they are on par with old sesame street cartoons if tells you anything), and they had to read the english subtitles to understand what was going on."
3,"Motivating, but nothing we didn't already know","This book is motivating for any bride-to-be as it provides practical tips and realistic goals for weightloss. However, don't be fooled by the title...it does not provide an actual diet. Basically the book just inspires you to eat anything with moderation and to exercise. That is something experts have been recommending for decades. In essence, nothing new is established. You're better off buying a bride magazine."
2,Disappointed,"The book arrived quickly and it's adorable. But, each page is ripped. Very disappointed. Seller should not have rated this item's condition as 'Good.'"
1,Disgusting,This book is a waste of money It is irrelevant to the issue at hand which is SCANNO of course.
4,Very handy,"I bought this because I was having hip replacement surgery and needed a raised seat and some sort of rail system. This installed easily and was easy to adjust to the correct height. It doesn't feel as sturdy as some, but it is certainly an acceptable and usable frame, and is the right price."
1,Not Safe At All,I WOULD NOT recommend this item to anyone. This is made so cheap. Not at all what it is desribed as. After securing it onto the toilet it was so shaky and not sturdy at all. This rail does not hold the weight it says it does and is NOT safe. I returned it after one day. I was not going to take the chance of my elderly parents falling. Do not bother buying this. Spend a little more money and get something stronger with more weight to it. This feels like it's made from tin. PLEASE! don't waste your money.
4,"Sturdy, but",Well made and sturdy.No instructions and a 50/50 chance to put it together wrong.You would think an engineer could figure it out.I didn't. I finally reversed the pieces and it worked.
1,AVOID,"Purchased 4 of the Drive Medical toilet safety frames, model # D 12000-4, at $33.02 each from My Health Stores, a/k/a Medical Department Stores. The Company sent 4 of the inferior quality Invracare model # 1392KD which are advertized on Amazon for $24 each."
4,Drive Medical toilet safety rail,Bought The Drive Medical Toilet safety frame rail for my husband to use...By adjusting the rail for his height it works very well. He is able to get up easily. I hooked it up to the toilet myself which was very EASY.I would recommend this item..Much cheaper than in a local store. I would also recommend Amazon
3,"Ok, but arms remain loose","When installed the arm parts of this toilet rail remain very loose (can move side to side) which gives a disabled person a sense of insecurity when using it. In fact, if a person is not warned about the loose arms this toilet rail could cause injury."
3,Not Perfect,"This frame serves its purpose. However, because there is no stabilization in front, the support rails are very loose. This gives the impression that it is unsafe. Could be a bit frightening for the user."
4,Into the classroom with an amazing professor...,"My friends joked when I bought this set that I would only watch it once, if that many times. But in the two weeks since I received it, I have watched most of the tapes twice! Fewer stories are told and illustrated than I had hoped (its pretty obvious this documentary was made more than a decade ago on a budget), but Campbell is an amazing teacher with fantastic insights. The tapes are a terrific way to relive your favorite part of college classes-- a brillant teacher with something new and fascinating to say."
4,Mythical beginnings explained,"Even if you're not familiar with Campbell's written work this DVD is worth a look if your a fan of mythology or interested in how myths evolved from ancient cultures. The background provided in these interviews between Bill Moyers and Joseph Campbell covers myths from every culture imaginable around the world. A variety of common place elements (love, hero worship, story telling, creationism, etc.) are explored from their origins through what they mean to people today.I'm giving this DVD 4.5 stars (although it's only showing 4 :/), but feel free to add that extra .5 star back if you don't mind the sometimes scripted emotions."
4,try them and maybe buy them,"I would just like to point out that many public libraries in the U.S. have this video collection. You really have no excuse for not borrowing this inspiring video collection, unless you have no time for watching videos period. And afterwards, some of you will want to buy the VHS collection or the DVD."
5,"joseph campbell, the power of myth","the product is excellent. i have been searching for this set of interviews for a long time, but i am only new to the internet. the dvd plays perfectly in my machine (region 4). the delievery time was fantastic as it arrived nearly 3 weeks early! thankyou"
5,Awesome DVD!,"This really is a great DVD for anyone interested in mythology, religion, humanity, philosophy, and all the ""big questions"" of life. I watched it first as a rental, but quickly decided I needed it in my home library. It is the type of DVD you could watch over and over and still find something new. Joseph Campbell was a professor of mythology and comparative religion at Sarah Lawrence College for almost 40 years. He is a well educated and well rounded professor, but he is definitely NOT an egghead intellectual. This is accessible information that can really help with every day struggles. So relax, use your imagination, and enjoy the magic and knowledge -- guaranteed well worth your time!"
3,Interesting and Powerful,"The book and the tapes on the power of myth are very interesting and interpret mythology and religion within the same paradigm and concepts - that myth flows from the contrary and contradictory stresses and strains of the body and society. The thesis is tightly explored by Campbell in numerous of his works and explains why he sometimes cannot explain (sorry) variations in conceptual problems among myths. Campbell had a tremendous impact on my study of comparative religion at university over 10 years ago, in a positive way, howver since then I've realized that his ideas are worn and flawed in many respects. Thinking outside of his parardigm of mythic evolution will raise many more questions than he attempts to answer. All in all I think Campbell is one of the greatest philosophers of comparative religion and mythology and someone who stood at a crossroads of academic insight over many decades."
5,Joseph Campbell / Bill Moyers - priceless,"I saw this series of interviews with Joseph Campbell back in the late 80's when it was aired on PBS. Moyers leads Campbell into areas in which Campbell's wisdom is allowed to flower - a great teacher guided by the reverent and thougtful questions of the ""student,"" Bill Moyers. Wow."
5,Master Of Mythology Speaks,"Truly inspiring! If you are a storyteller, or a lover of storytelling, or a crafter of stories, this video offers valuable insights in the dynamics of storytelling mythologies. Joseph Campbell, like life's ""call to adventure"" (for the hero soul), invites us into the human realm of mythology to inform us, to illuminate us, and to endear the hero within us all. Journey along with Bill Moyers as he probes the mysterious mythological meanings in our human stories. Moyers continuously asks the penetrating questions which ultimately reveal Mr. Campbell's profound knowledge our mythological archetypes. Moyers' genuine interest, student-like attitude, and friendly-conversational manner put the viewer directly in the interview. Truly enthralling!"
5,The Power of Joseph Campbell,I do not feel worthy of even reviewing Joseph Campbell. His eloquence and views are without peers.
2,Deleted parts,"I have seen the full length interview before and thought that I had bought it. However, there were several parts missing. The hero myth concerning the origins of the buffalo dance came to mind. Then the section about love was gone. I truly feel robbed!"
5,How can I express just in words?,"This unforgettable set of interviews given for Joseph Campbell to Bill Moyers meant for me a towering revelation . The supreme domain and the powerful eloquence of this colossal thinker in every little detail as product of his multifacetic knowledgement let you amazed .To me every chapter of these interviews have is so valuable and reveals so many things that it's a must for you watching with your friends or your pupils (according the case)over and over . This set of interviews are from 1986 and the background was the residence of George Lucas .If you are really interested not only in the mythology , but in multiple aspects (sociological , historical , psycholigical among others issues) derivated all along every interview , you must not miss this opportunity .I know you will never be the same after you watch all of these chapters ."
1,Did not play,"I could not get the video working as it was not ""geographically able to play that with that format"" As I live in the UK and this is American. this is the second copy that I have purchased of Joseph Campbell an the power of Myth that has not worked. I have emailed Acorn but received no response about three weeks agoMichael Hill"
1,Shoot me now...,"Joseph Campbell thinks about thinking too much that it has become unhealthy. His nonsense ramblings with Bill Moyers damage the young, still functioning, minds of America's youth. Campbell's story telling skills are sketchy and hard to follow. Campbell believes that all myths are part of human's subconscious and that if humans make mistakes they are unaware of what they are doing. Maybe the myths from the past aren't related to the subconscious. Honestly, has anyone ever proved that this hidden mentality exists? We cannot touch, hear, or see this state of mind. Yet, according to Campbell it must be real, it has to be the root of all good and evil in the world. For every error in this world he blames it on some fluke attitude. Wake up Campbell! Its called the subconscious for a reason-its hidden."
1,"Empty-speak, thy name is Campbell","Credulity, thy name is Moyers.Interesting only if you enjoy hours of somebody speaking without anything to say. Tedium at its finest."
5,Understanding the core of mythology can resurect your thinking,"The Power of Myth transformed my thinking about mythology. It exposed me to a much finer way of thinking about religion and cultural mythology. It showed me how important myth is on so many levels in society, especially didactically.Joseph Campbell has become for me one of the greatest influences in the development of my thinking, both on an internal and external level. He has given me a language to support this development, that when used, can free your thinking even further.If you want to be profoundly affected, if you are looking to grow and develop, these six episodes are a must in your collection of things that will change your life."
5,Joseph Campbell and the Power of Myth,"I have seen the original broadcast, in 1988, and thought it excellent at that time and have viewed it many times since on PBS.I am delighted with my purchase - owning such a powerful piece - sharing with others - and hearing gems of wisdom anew each time I view it is a wonderful treat. Joseph Campbell awakens thoughts and ideas deep within the heart and soul!"
4,For everyone of any religious or non-religious background,"Joseph Campbell brings an enthusiasm to the study of religion and mythology that few can match. Even if you disagree with his major conclusions - and I do disagree with some of them - he will inspire you to look at your own religion in a new light. Seriously speaking, these interviews may change your life."
5,the best,"I think that Joseph Campbell was a brilliant man who definitely found his bliss. I bought this to share with my children who are now 15 and 12 and they understand it and love it. It gives an amazing look at myths from ancient tribal and American Indian legends through christian fables, explains them and gives examples of how most are universal."
3,An inexpensive solution,"I am pleased, but not overjoyed with this enclosure. It serves my purpose quite well, but is too flimsy and wobbly for a substantial screen enclosure. It hides a corner of by back yard where I store gardening supplies (pots, dirt, fertilizer, etc. And for that purpose I am satisfied with my purchase. If I needed something sturdier and attractive, I would have looked for something else."
3,Should have listened,Frankly I should have paid more attention to other reviewers. It is very cheap looking and very flimsy. I bought it to hide the air conditioner. It is what it is and I suppose it's slightly better than the conditioner unit but not by much. Just be warned and remember in this case you get what you pay for. I will use it until I get around to finding something that looks more attractive.
2,Flimsy,"This product is much more flimsy and cheap looking than I had expected. The plastic is thin and barely able to hold its shape. I am very disappointed. I didn't realize that the object I'm trying to hide, a propane tank, would be so visible behind the lattice portion of the screen."
3,might not be good for A/C,"I purchased this item to cover an ugly air-conditioner. While the product was very good-looking, and it says it's suitable to cover an air-conditioner, the bottom of the panels are solid and I have a tight space to fit in the screen. I was told this would not allow A/C to breathe since it was so close. I had to return it but got a full refund, no problems. I liked the looks of the screen but it was not appropriate for my needs."
2,Flimsy and not very attractive...,"I was expecting something a little more substantial, however this item is very flimsy, the panels flex and bend easily, they also look cheap and not very attractive. I was planning to use this to hide a few medium size garbage cans, but the cans are very visible through the lattice, and just peak over the top. Sad to say, but I think that this is going to be an open box yard sale item..."
3,Outdoor Screen,"This product does what it says, but it is more flimsy than it looks in the picture. Don't expect it to replace a fence.I'm happy with it."
1,Junky!,"I suppose if you intend to put it somewhere where you never have to touch it and you can secure it really well, it may work for you. I thought I could use it around the garbage cans and just move it every time I needed to get to the cans. The problem is that the pieces are connected by a rod that will just fall right out if you try to move one panel. It was a flimsy, cheap solution for something that could have been engineered a lot better. I returned it."
2,Attractive but flimsy,"Very attractive, but flimsy and doesn't stand up well. If I had not destroyed the box it came in, I would have returned it. It is now residing at the back of my garage and I wasted a lot of money that I really don't have."
3,Poor Suppoprt Design,Metal posts are too small in diameter and too short to properly support the fence. After installation the fence started leaning in 2 days. I purchased longer and wider diameter aluminum posts and now the fence is very sturdy. The manufacture should consider larger posts for this product. I believe customers would be willing to pay a little more for a sturdy design. Posts should fit snug into panel post holes.
2,"Set your expectation - Very plastic, filmy, molded, and non-professional looking fence","Set your expectation - Very plastic, filmy, molded and non-professional looking fence. However, it does work. Just set your expectation. I won't buy again at the $90 price range."
3,Heavier than I expected,I had a pan that kept food from burning on the bottom and was trying to replace it. This is much heavier than the one I had.
3,Tense Beethoven in boxy sound--ths isn't my idea of a classic,"I have bought these performances several times since the Sixties and always wind up wondering why British critics have extolled them for fifty years. Erich Kleiber was the closest ting Germany produced to a Toscanini, in that his interpretations were often tense, almost hectic, and highly controlled. On that everyone agrees; the disagreement is over how valuable you find those characteristics.I am not inclined to like Toscanini, Szell, or Kleiber for their tight grip on Beethoven. The Eroica and Fifth Sym. here display little heroism or breadth. For those who appreciate the Toscanini style as channeled through Kleiber, and who can ignore the boxy mono sound (which for me is only tolerable because Toscanini's rCA sound was even worse), these are exemplary performances. I will continue to avoid them."
4,Denial Confronted,"This video gives new meaning to the word disturbing. It's honest treatment of a greusome act prevents you from shutting the damned thing off. This film will give you pause for the rest of your life, it could concievably save a few lives."
3,A milder account,"Okay, so maybe it isn't the most riveting book on the planet, and maybe the writing isn't all that great, and maybe the foreshadowing is a little much, but give me a break. Any survivor's account of the holocaust is worth your time. The more we understand, the better people we are, and the more we honor those who have taken the time to share their pain with us. I first read this book as a school assignment, and have re-read it serveral times since, just because of the respect I have for Ms. Ten Boom. And those of you who commented on the horrors of life in prison camps...if this is the only Holocaust book you have read, you have no idea. Hiding Place is very, very mild compared to most of the others. For a real understanding, try visiting Auschwitz yourself...I have, and I will forever be changed by the experience. One more thing...I definitely recommend Jane Yolen's Briar Rose, not a true account, but a moving story nonetheless."
1,"SMUG, POMPOUS, WASTE OF TIME","Not at all original, funny, or interesting. This movie tries so very hard (to the point where it is obvious) to be ""adult"" and handle an array of topics about sex and love. BORING! I've seen better films on LIFETIME, especially that one movie with Fred Savage beating women! In Search of is literally worse than television drama, there is NOTHING racy, over the top, or jaw dropping about this movie except for the smugness that seeps through! This film was a waste of time and somebody's money. Not bad for a community college class project, but other than that, about as intriguing as a monkey throwing feces at the camera! Actually that would have been preferred over the waste of celluloid that, In Search Of, is. If you are over 65, conservative, have lots of cats, love Jesus, don't know a thing about sex, and bored, this movie is for you."
4,Good energy pick up,"This is a good drink to have before you head to the gym, it'll increase your energy and allow you to work out longer and harder than if you'd not had it. The taste is so-so...kind of strong, a little tongue numbing, tastes a little like licorice. Not my favorite tasting energy drink, but will definately do the job."
5,Aaliyah...! Sing!,"This song is great. Everytime i listen to it, i wanna hear again and again. Its been my fave song for years and still is. The melody is fantastic and Aaliyah's vocal slaps the beat with haunting vibes. Aaliyah + Timbaland = Genius! The original version is my fave but the New Remix featuring Missy Elliott is phat too. It's given a whole new flavour with Missy rapping like her old self again. Overall, its a superb song from an even stunning lady.RegardsSi"
2,"Great songs, terrible sound quality","It grieves me to give a Bing Crosby selection a paltry two stars, but the quality of this CD is abysmal. I am convinced that someone merely stuck a cheap tape recorder in front of a TV playing this classic movie and then marketed this pale imitation of the original soundtrack.The scratches, skipped notes and hideous tonal quality are reminiscent of a beat up old 78 record. What a disappointment considering this disc contains some hard-to-locate Bing songs like ""I'll Capture her Heart"" and ""I've Got Plenty to be Thankful For."" You might as well buy the VHS version of Holiday Inn and make your own recording from the film. This CD's quality is the nadir of listening experiences!"
2,Not the original soundtrack of the movie,"...Does not have the spirit of the film...Marjorie Reynolds is no great singer but without her on WHITE CHRISTMAS, no delight."
5,This is it!!,"This version of Sheherazade is the one to go for. It has since it was released on LP in 1980 always been my favorit version. I have countless of other versions( i love this work)including Reiner,Mackerras,Muti,Temirkanov,Beecham,Karajan etc, and i can honestly say that no other version have such great and natural sonics (with the possibly exception of the new Telarc CD) It`s true that Kondrashin doesnt thinker with the tempos, he`s letting the music speak for itself and by doing so he is creating genuin excitment. Hermann Krebbers portrayal of Sheherezades narrative is equally compelling. A must have disc."
1,The only positive reviews come from the manufacturer!,"This is hilarious! A2ZCDS is a bootleg company with terrible product, yet they get rave reviews from anonymous contributors! Check out ""my reviews"" for either one of them. The only product they've ever reviewed from Amazon were A2ZCDS, which they thought were all fantastic! C'mon, whoever you are - show a little bit of ethical behavior! You've never bought anything else from Amazon that you'd like to review?The first reviewer nailed it. Spend more and get the real thing. It's not worth watching a boot of a film currently available from a legit company."
5,Combines scholarly discussion with Biblical insights,"I have just completed my classes for a doctorate in counseling psychology and have had dozens of books assigned as texts over the years. To be honest, most of them sit in one of my ""backroom"" bookcases. This book is one of the exceptions.This work covers the major theories of pscyhotherapy and makes you feel like someone who has a firm grasp of them when you read it. The review from a Biblical viewpoint really gives you a lot to think about. The authors are also very objective, not showing favorites among the various schools of thought. This book is a must for every student and teacher of counseling and psychology."
4,"Great text, dated citations","Great survey of history and basic categories of psychotherapies out there. Chapter 2, a Christian description of human personality is particularly useful for faith-based counselors. The second edition has been reviewed and updated, yet the bulk of the text seems to retain a very large number of dated references, citing research done in the 1980's or older. That's more than 20 years old, and somewhat concerning. Chapters are consistently structured with descriptions of philosophical assumptions, model of personality, health, abnormality, and therapy, followed by thoughtful Christian critique in response to each of these aspects of a particular theoretical orientation. Good value for price."
3,A Psychology textbook,"Modern Psychotherapies is a psychology textbook that attempts to give a wide overview of many psychotherapies and techniques currently being borrowed by Christian based therapists to help people. None of the therapies within the textbook are truly ""Christian"" in nature, but some have been used and modified to be very useful. The text is not, however, for someone who has never studied psychology 101. The jargon/language the book is written in is for someone that has been exposed, at least, to basic psychological terms. If the student has not been introduced to psychology yet they may find reading this book a bit intimidating. It does give a decent account though of the science and how it has been adapted so far to use by Christian/faith based psychologist, pastors and therapist so far. It is worth the read if you are a student of psychology or pastoral counseling."
2,Did not read like a Garrett Novel,"I don't know what the author has planned (since he's finishing off the series with the next book...personaly I expect a blow-out with the Kingpin) but this just didn't read like a Garrett novel. Doris and Marsha are suddenly speaking perfect Karentine (they couldn't in the other novels), the Tates' have Dwarfish ancesters instead of the Elvish ones as named in the first book, we have [over-sexed] aliens (actually, everyone is over-sexed) and someone named Kathy (where did she come from?). I kept expecting Garret to wake up at the end and find that this was all a bad dream.I give this book 2 stars only because I truly enjoy the rest of the series (to the point of reading them every third month or so). Otherwise, I'd be giving it a -1 star."
1,Whodunnit is right.,"Normally, I love Glen Cook's writing, and especially his Garrett novels. I suppose that's why it's so hard for me to believe he actually wrote this. Come on, Glen; admit it. You were so busy working on other projects that you let a fanboy crank this one out and put your name on it. Absolutely terrible effort in a series known for some pretty decent work."
2,Uninspired story that never seemed to end,"This is the first Glen Cook novel that I have not thoroughly enjoyed. Usually I read the Garrett novels in one sitting and when I get to the end of the story I am so sad that it is over that I have to read it again. ... I read all the novels chronologically several times a year (and have been doing so since I first picked up a Garret Novel in 1994).This book was a huge disappointment. I do not like stories that mix Science Fiction and Fantasy. (I like my Sci-Fi science-y and my Fantasy magical), and was surprised that Glen Cook added the Sci-Fi element to this series. There was too much gratuitous sex in the novel. (all written with good taste, but still - it was off-putting). I also didn't like the little inconsistencies that were brought up in this story (Doris and Marsha speaking in complete, grammatically correct sentences!! etc.).Overall this book does not live up to its predecessors."
2,Cook's Strangest Garrett Book,"I wanted to write this review after I'd had some time pass since reading it. But now I have nothing to add that other fans of the series haven't already said.Indeed, this is Cook's weakest, darkest and most inconsistant book in the Files of Garrett PI line. Did he lose the will to write it, and only did so because he had a contract with the publisher? Did Mr. Cook lose his notes and didn't know who or what his characters were anymore (I was waiting for Morley Dotes to chow down on a steak any moment)?More's the pity becuase the events could have been the basis for Garrett's biggest adventure yet. Instead, it feels like the author needed to cram what seems like his own deepest dark outlook in our own world into this novel."
3,"Great series, but this is the worst book in it","For whatever reason, Cook takes the series in a new direction, with the addition of aliens to the cast. Unfortunately, it doesn't blend well with his universe, though some of the aspects of the integration are quite funny. Also, the heavily convuluted subplots and large cast of characters made it rather confusing, especially towards the end. All of the other books in the series are great, though."
2,cook has a ghost writer? or did his son do this?,"all the 3star and less reviews are fairly accurate.. this book just cant be written by glen cook. there are way too many inconsistencies in character and fact from prior books. all the other books in this series i just couldnt put down. this? im having a hard time getting through a chapter at a time. i wouldve guessed this to be cook's first stab at writing had i not known better. suffer through it if you really like the series, but dont waste your money on it new. i wouldnt pay more than a buck for this one... pew!"
5,A great novel which I loved from a series I loved.,I loved this book! I did not know it was the one which got 'bad' reviews (which reviews I had read months ago). I am extremely grateful to the author.Now to be objective I'll say that every village in America should have a statue of Glen Cook in the village green.

5,Mother in Law Loved It!,I bought this as a Mother's Day gift for my MIL and she loved it! Product smells very nice and comes in a very pretty bottle.
1,Something must be wrong with me....,I ordered this perfume after reading the reviews on Amazon. I'm not understanding how people find this perfume attractive at all. No one in my household likes it either. It smells worst than dog poo to me and honestly...no one could even PAY me to wear this. Worst part- not returnable to Amazon.
4,A SOPHISTICATED ORIENTAL FRAGRANCE,"Whoever said you can't tell a book by its cover hadn't seen the container Lagerfeld designed for this fragrance - its as lovely as the scent it holds.Adding to his popular fragrance, Chloe"" and his standby men's scent, ""Lagerfeld,"" Karl Lagerfeld introduced Sun Moon Stars in, I believe, 1994.While, to my knowledge it has not enjoyed the customer base that Chloe does, it is, nonetheless, an outstanding scent. It's an attractive blend of oriental and floral notes.True to his designer roots Lagerfeld presents it in a stunning bottle - a midnight blue frosted glass orb rimmed by motifs of the sun, moon, and stars."
5,excelente,excelente producto muy recomendado la entrega fue rapida y la calidad del producto es original..en lo particular me gustan mucho esta marca
2,Sun Moon and Stars,"While I love the fragrance, it must be very watered down because the scent doesn't last 30 minutes"
1,smells like grandma,"Actually ordered cause i thought the bottle was pretty,which it its. The scent...not so much. Smells like something an old lady would wear,luckily i got the small bottle."
1,Falls Flat,"After reading all the feedback on this perfume I decided to give it a try. Am terribly disappointed in it, when I first spray it on you can smell it for about 5 minutes then nothing. Unfortunately it just didn't work for me at all. I do not feel the scent stays with you. I would not recommend to anyone."
1,disappointed,"smells very bad,I'm disappointed that I can't return it. I bought it because I was rreading all these positive comments,I really don't understand why people like it so much."
5,"Beautiful bottle, beautiful scent","I first started wearing Sun, Moon, Stars in high school and ten years later it's still a favorite of mine. The scent is exotic and sultry while still being light and feminine, not unlike the sun, moon and stars themselves. Great for day or night use. The bottle it comes in is one of the most gorgeous I've seen and is like a little piece of art in itself. I would recommend this to women of any age, it's simply wonderful."
5,One of the better multivitamins on the market,"This is an excellent vitamin. Reading the ingredient and comparing them with other vitamins in this price range, MHPs Activite is a great value!"
2,Waste of Money,"I have just begun reading this book, and I definitely do not recommend it. The movie is a much better depiction of the screenplay. The grammar in here is atrocious, and the constant errors and strangely worded phrases interrupt the flow of the novel. I recommend the movie, but as for the novel, a doorstop is the only function I can think of for this piece of ""literature""."
1,Disappointing.,"I would be lying if I said I thought it was a good book. It reads as though the screenplay was merely rearranged into paragraphs and left at that. The characters lack depth and substance. I haven't seen the movie but this book didn't tempt me to pay money for that pleasure. I have noticed that proofreading has become a lost art since the advent of the personal computer. This book is a prime example of the over-reliance of authors (and editors?) on spell checks. Why didn't they go so far as use the grammar check as well? At least I would have been spared reading a description of Margaret(?) of Guise that starts ""Her dark over eyes..."" and, if I'm not mistaken, further on in the book ""... paid her complements.."" Would some publisher out there like to pay me to proofread their books before publication? My rates are very reasonable... :-)"
2,Huh?,"This novelization is frankly inconsistent with the movie upon which it is based. Certain key scenes (such as the one which opens the film) are simply missing, and others are contradicted altogether (in the film, the poisoned dress is fatal; in the book, the wearer survives and is sent to the Tower). Conversely, Amy Robsart's name and questionable death are in the book, but not the movie.These points might come about if the movie were loosely based on the book, but IIRC the book is based on the screenplay. The book is fine on its own, but as a novelization, it's mind-bogglingly bad."
3,Better compilations available,"I recently began collecting compilations of great opera performances as raw material for custom CD's. After listening to this CD side-by-side with others, I ended up using not a single selection from it. Three double CD's that, in my opinion, have much more to offer, in both quantity and quality, are (1) Decca's The #1 Opera Album, (2) EMI's The Opera Album, and (3) Warner Brothers' Simply The Best Night At The Opera. If I could have only one, it would be the Decca product, but each has it's own strengths, unlike the RCA disc. The caveat here is that taste in music is a highly personal matter."
3,The wrong smell,"I grew up with the old school Lysol. My mother used the concentrate to clean the floors and bathrooms and the spray came out every time a dog (or toddler) peed on the carpet, the garbage bag got changed, or if raw chicken was cooked she'd spray the counters. I can't find the original scent Lysol anywhere and I was thrilled to find this on a shelf at Walmart. The problem? It's not the right smell. Maybe I got a bad batch because all the reviews here say it's great but the stuff I got smells like iodine. I miss the old Lysol clean smell and it sucks now that I can't trust the ""original scent"" label anymore. I've bought the yellow/gold can of spray and it smelled right, but my mop water now smells like iodine, no matter how much I dilute it."
5,Lysol Brand Concentrate Disinfectant - Original Scent: 12 OZ,I love it Lysol Concentrate is no longer sold in the stores were I live in NC. or GA. Came up on Lysol for cleaning the house hold bath rooms Be ordering with you soon.
5,Lysol concentrate disinfectant,It is a disinfectant for cripes sake!!! It smells bad. What kind of review does one write??
5,Lysol concentrate,"This product is very hard to find locally. It is a concentrated germ killer and has a clean long-lasting fragrance. It's especially good for towels and bedding when you use it the washing machine. Even underwear can be made cleaner and odor free with this product. Also works well cleaning children's toys and baby clothes by diluting it with some amount of water. The strength can be adjusted as needed. Great product from the ""old days""."
4,Well packed and delivered quickly,"The local stores stopped carrying this product. (It's time testing at deodorizing a sour washing machine, gym clothes and even old shoes.)I was happy to find it on amazon. The vendor pack these factory sealed bottles in plastic and taped the bags closed for extra protection. My order arrived days ahead of schedule. Well done."
5,The Adventures of Captain Computerman and His Sidekick Mouseman : The Saving of the Toy Websites,"This book is filled with fantasy and adventure. It's easily a book that kids can really dive into. It's important for kids to exercise their imagination and this book certainly avails itself to that process. Further, new generations of children are speaking a ""tech"" language and this book both builds and plays on this lingo!"
4,rear window visor,"Great product. Makes my vehicle look sporty and chic. a tad bit expensive, but I love the look it gives the truck and the quality is terrific."
3,Fell Off After 6 Months,"This thing worked great on my Ford Explorer Sport Trac for about 6 months. The weather stripping started to deteriorate, so I strengthened the parts that were coming off with some gorilla glue. But that was just delaying the inevitable...the thing flew off on the highway, fortunately not hurting anyone.So I liked it for 6 months but was disappointed that it was only held on with adhesive, which seems like an obvious failure point."
1,"""The Root of All Evil""???","While I do not fault this book for being simple, as it seems directed at new traders, the writing is lacking. At one point the author jokingly refers to Microsoft as the root of all evil. While conversational writing may be appropriate for some subjects, it was distracting and ultimately irritating. Additionally, I do not need to see screenshots of Yahoo or excel... There are better choices."
4,Find the perfect pairs and you're there....,"As a trader, I found the book gave a good overview on ""Pairs Trading"", but many of the examples, including the ""Trading Diary"" on Chapter 22 provided little inspiration to someone looking to make sizeable profits out of pairs trades. For example in Chapter 22, titled the ""Trading Diary"", after just 30 business days (41 days) the model trade in the book yielded a return of just 1.04%.Indeed, the basic premise behind the pairs trade, forgetting all the fancy statistics I found is to simply to look at the chart and see if it's tradeable (i.e has it got a range-bound movement!!!). The secret is to find the charts. To accompany this book you really need some good pairs trading software to find these charts. There's limited providers but I'm going to try http://www.pairstrade.com."
1,amazon sucks! CANT HANDLE A CD,"I ordered this book and i came without the CD. Then I ordered the replacement. a month later, the replacement got here WITHOUT THE CD!!!!!DON'T BUY! AMAZON DOES NOT DELIVER THE CD!"
2,Introduction to Bayesian Statistics not so good....,Not enough formal. Subjects exposition is not accurate. It would make a good high schoold book but doesn't meet formalism requirements for academical purposes.
2,Very Basic,I am in an Intro to Bayes class now and wanted to buy a book that would supplement the handouts we got. The class is a mix of graduate and undergraduate students. Reviews on other sites said this was an excellent book and well written. It is...for the materials it covers. We are not even halfway through our term and have already covered all the material in the book. There are no chapters on hierarchical Bayesian methods or MCMC methods. Just be aware that the book is very basic.
5,A must for beginners,"This books is an excellent introduction to any person interested on bayesian statistics. It provides straightforward explanations about the philosophy that supports bayesian statistics and its applications to credibility intervals, hypotesis testing and regression. After a first reading this book I finally understood conditional probabilities too!"
5,You won't believe,"If you weren't told that Flagstad is 62, you wouldn't think that this Brunnhilde was sung by a 62 year old Wagnerian!! At 62, Flagstad cannot compete with Birgit Nilsson in her prime between 44 to 48 in the Bohm and Solti recordings. But still, it is amazing that Flagstad still has so much power in her voice. There is no hint of strain - just a thrillingly huge voice.Although no match for Birgit Nilsson in Solti or Bohm, this is still a very interesting piece of history. Given her singing here, imagine what Flagstad would have been like in her prime!!"
2,Disappointment,"Not the best guitar. Bought a Washburn Rover from Amazon that is perfect for a portable with better ease of use, sound and tuning. The name ""Martin"" on this does not necessary mean it is good."
4,"Cool and quality, just not very loud.","I've enjoyed it a lot. It sounds best when ""picking"" than with strumming. Overall glad I purchased it. Good build."
5,"FRIGHTNING, EXCELLENT, COMPELLING- A MUST!","'The Handmaids Tale' is a very god film/ a definite favourite of mine. I really like this film, and find the events that take place very interesting/ compelling and damn right scary if it were to really happen in the near future. Natasha Richardson is excellent in the lead. All the actors were well casted, and I love Traci Lin's small part in the film who's always a favourite of mine. I absoluely recommend this film to anyone that is curious and/or interested in this film.By Justine Ryan"
1,Wrong product,"This may very well be my mistake, but I don't think so. I have been waiting for ages to get this movie from Netflix but I guess they don't have it (in which case, just tell me). So I decided to order a copy from Amazon.com. Since we no longer have a VHS player, I am sure I ordered a DVD. I received a VHS in the mail. Not sure how to handle this, it has been sitting on my kitchen counter for weeks. Perhaps someone can step in and help me with this. My time is very limited, so please don't refer me to a phone number where I am on hold for ages."
4,How do you survive when you do not own yourself?,"""Pollution has caused sterility in 99% of the women. A war has overturned the government, and fertile women are deprived of their reproductive rights. Owned by the wives of the ruling men, they are forced to become ""handmaids"". How do you survive when all women are treated as chattel, segregated as a wife or a whore... and you have been classed as the latter?"""
2,disappointing in comparison to the novel,"Having read the book, the film was a bit of a let down for me. It loses the seriousness of the themes it conveys by over-glamourizing the situation. In my opinion, it used more artistic licence than should be allowed, and even had major changes which undermined the whole concept of Offred NOT being a heroine, and lost the ambiguity of the ending. Whilst interesting for someone not already acquainted with The Handmaid's Tale, if you already know Margaret Atwood's novel you will be disappointed. I would reccommend reading the text to anyone who has watched the film and wants a deeper representation."
2,Not That Bad,"I liked the concept of this movie and I really didn't think it was that bad. However,the acting was dry. The story itself was the compelling factor. I had no idea this was originally a novel. Now, instead of buying the movie I'm going to buy the book. This way I can be abosrbed in the story without having the visual details delivered to me."
1,A poor movie.,"Poorly acted, poorly scripted, poorly directed, poorly filmed, an all around badly made movie. Don't waste your time with this one. There are a lot better films out there."
3,"""Freedom is just another word for nothing left to lose"" - Kris Kristofferson","Once upon a time in the recent future a country went wrong. The country was called The republic of Gilead.Due to pollution only one in one-hundred women is not sterile and is force to be a surrogate or handmaid to the rich and powerful in a state where right-wing fundamentalists are in charge. Kate (Natasha Richardson) is caught trying to escape the country with husband and daughter. She is apprehended, husband dispatched and daughter reeducated. Kate has the privilege of becoming the handmaid of the commander (Robert Duvall) and his wife (Faye Dunaway). The film is much more complex and the book by Margaret Atwood that it is loosely based on is even more complex.You can defiantly put this in the category of tear-jerker and nail-biter."
2,Not as good as the book,"There are a fair few differences between the book and the film. And if you're studying the book for A level english lit, the film will cause confusion! Read the book, it's much better."
2,"Okay Flick, From a Marxist-Feminist Point of View","It was an okay film, in my opinion. I can see why lots of people like it, though. You need to have a certain socio-feminist perspective, really, to enjoy it. Overall, though, it's a polemic against those who espouse conservative and/or religious values."
2,hand maids tale not good,"I read the handmaid's tale for my grade 12 english class and I thought that it was quite insufficient for an intellectual of my standard. The book is basically a porn story and how women are being exploited in the world. It was good for a while, but towards the middle of the book it seemed incredibly boring. END"
3,ENOUGH with the book everybody. jeezus...,"It's a good MOVIE. Apparently adapted from some book, but who cares?? We want to know about the MOVIE."
3,The Handmaid's Tale,"The DVD was shipped in a timely manner and was in perfect condition. The movie itself, The Handmaid's Tale, was not as good as I remembered it, but it was good to see it again and refresh my memory. Acting was good."
4,Read it!,"Don't judge a book by it's movie!...For the film, the book was contorted into a chronological sequence. Also, the film's Offred has more of her wits about her than the book (whose Offred clings to her right mind whenever she can manage), loosing the romance of the book heroine piecing together the remnants of her story. And yet it's still a movie that doesn't digest so easily-the film is quite haunting, actually, if a little campy.This film is over ten years old. Call it a cult classic!"
5,WOW! SHOCKING BUT IT COULD HAPPEN,This movie is scary. This could happen if the religious right gets a hold of this country more than it has now. This movie also reminds me of the quiverfull life style. Just scary. Don't kid yourself if you think this can't happen. I'm going to have nightmares tonight. I may also sleep with my lights on.The movie has a surprising but great ending.
3,Disturbing!,"I read this book a couple of years ago and did not realizethere was a movie until I happened to notice it in the video store.The movie is nothing like the book. The book was much better. The movie drags way too much, and the focus of the movie is on ""romance,""--not so much on the society of Gilead. However, even without the book, it is an interesting story and sobering to consider. Beautiful Faye Dunaway was an improvement over the dumpy Serena Joy portrayed in the book, and was very good at portraying the ""Bondage"" that existed for all women in this society--even the supposedly ""privileged."" Robert Duvall is amazing, as always, and in spite of his ""corrupt"" character,(...).Overall, a movie worth watching. END"
5,Moby Dog,Our 7-year old girl finds this story to be humorous. The copy received was in fine condition.
5,Store your collectible comics!,"These Silver size mylar comic book sleeves keep an old comic in mint condition. They provide more support than a plastic comic bag, and are also more transparent than plastic, so they display the comic better. Definitely worth the money!"
5,hard to find size,"I was looking for a beach/outdoor hat, my head is apparently bigger than most. I got the XXL and it fit perfect. The construction seems solid, it has been worn to the beach several times and in and out of the water. Also worn at home while moving lawn, etc. the brim is very floppy, so it doesn't stay up out of my eyes as much as I would like. That is the only thing I don't like about it. For the price a very good buy. (I tried on several very expensive ones at the local outdoors shop prior to deciding on this, and I'm glad I did)"
5,This was a gift - Purchased on Amazon,"This hat was ordered as a favor for a friend. I assume he recieved it but he has never called. I suspect he liked the hat very much because he saw my husband wearing one and asked him where he bought it. He wanted one too. He was not familiar with how easy it is to find and purchase items on Amazon. All I did was place the order for him.In the meantime, I think my husband's hat is starting to look pretty grundgy. I'm going to order him another one."
5,Perfect for Yard Work and Outdoors Activities,"I have really enjoyed this hat for over two months now, finding it to be very comfortable while providing much needed protection from the sun. It feels surprisingly light on my head and stays cool. The vendor provided excellent service and tracking info and quick shipping."
1,Not Waterproof!!,"This product is 100% cotton, if your looking to keep rain off your head it is definetly NOT the way to go!!!!!!"
4,As Shown,The hat arrived quickly and fit just fine. It looks just like the photo shown and seems to be decent quality
5,Great DVD!,Great Classic. The DVD was in great shape and it came sooner than expected! I've already watched it 5 times since I recieved it! The kids really love it.
5,"Hey, gotta own them, we grew up with them!",We all grew up watching these wonderful claymations every year. Infact they bring back great childhood memories for most of us. The recordings on DVD are excellent and it is nice to watch these without COMMERCIAL breaks! Now we own them and our future children will watch them if they should disappear from television someday.
4,Timeless design & undisputed quality,"I was researching this watch for over six months, reading and reading several reviews, since my timex iroman strap and clap broke appart after two years of usage (and I wasn't even wearing it everyday), I decided to go for a more durable and realiable daily sport watch, which I can wear on the office, on weekends, working out, playing with my kids, off to the countryside, anywhere.This Casio was certainly the best choice, I've no doubt on quality and functionality, my only concern was the size because I've a small wrist but I solved it by trying one on at the local store. The design now it looks more like a classic instead of a old model, everyone will notice a classic G Shock because of the brand/model combination, it's even more captivating than newer G Shock models.Best of all, I saved about 40% of the price compared to the local retailer, I took less than a week for Amazon to hit my local PO box outside US."
5,Just Replaced After 15 Years,This watch has been a fine companion for over 14 years. I'm a semi retired guide and this has literally been round the world and back. It has all the features I really need and none of the crap I don't (I do have a Sunto that I don't wear and a Seiko that I do). I liked the DW5600e so much that the protective rubber casing eventually cracked and wore off. I guess I got my moneys worth.Saturday I caught the replacement velcro band on a jib block while racing the Hobie Cat. Whoops - guess the fish in Cacasde Reservior won't be late for dinner. Purchased the replacement today for less than what I think I payed for the origional. Thats value.If want something that works and will last a long time buy this watch. Otherwise move along - you will not appreciate new school coming back around the circle to old school simplicity and form. I don't often review gear but this deserves it. Truly a classic.
4,Perfect,The watch is amazing and is exactly what I was looking for when I am working out and running. Great for casual wear aswellPrompt delivery and shipping. Thanks!
5,Best Watch I've Ever Owned,"This is the best watch, without a doubt, that I have ever owned. I grew up wearing timex ironmans and didn't think much about them only lasting a year or two. But this watch is built solid, and it's easy to tell. I work on a farm, so I definitely needed something that could take a beating, and this watch certainly can! In fact, it's not even showing any signs of wear or tear either. So if you want a watch that has all the basics, and no gimmicks, this is the one. And it will last!"
3,"STILL A GREAT WATCH, BUT --- ??","THIS MODEL DOES NOT HAVE DUAL TIME??? I have had this exact same watch for many years, finally having to replace it. For some unknown reason, CASIO dropped the DUAL TIME feature. WHY?? All of the other features are still available and no new features were added, so why did they drop a very useful feature for travelers. Even their cheaper ($15) watches have dual time, so it cannot be an expensive feature. Just does not make any sense to delete features from one of the most successful watches ever designed. A little disappointed in CASIO!"
5,My second one - Love it even more,"This is the original G-Shock. I got my first one in 1989. Finally, thie year, after 3 battery replacements; and after surviving many a whack that would have ruined lesser watches, it died during a 4th battery replacement. Maybe my own fault. This is the lightest, most comfortable, most durable, and simplest watch money can buy. Also, it's very easy to read by my aging eyes, in dim or bright light, or the dark (nice bright backlight)."
2,casio men's g-shock classic digital watch,"I was a little bit disappointed because I thought the face of the watch would be larger than what I got.However, for the price, I think I got what I paid for.Thanks."
1,"Brad, RI","This is now in the landfill.It was a piece of junk of no value.casio watchThe manufacturer should be ashamed to produce such junk, as shouldyou for selling it.Brad"
4,World Traveler,"I sailed around the world with a watch identical to this one and just replaced it because the rubber cover finally deteriorated. The original watch still functions, just the band and cover are gone. I especially like the dual time zone feature since I could keep my home zone intact and adjust the local time. I also used the alarm feature and night light a lot.It's a tough, reliable watch that goes well at work and play. Price is right, too."
4,Good watch,I liked this watch for it's simplistic features and for the price point. Unfortunately I lost it in a ski lodge not too long after I bought it. I ended up buying a Timex T5E901 to replace it and think it's a much better watch but a bit more money. Still cheap for an everyday work wear.
5,CASIO G-Shock Watch,"Great product, great price. I was disappointed in the cost of shipping. $33 Watch and nearly $10 to ship (not overnight). I could have purchased from local Wal-Mart for same price."
3,great for kids.,I suppose it would be good for kids because the screen is very dark and can not be read unless there is a lot of light or you wanted to use the watch light everytime it was a little shady also the numbers are kind of small which adds to the difficulty.The watch is also thicker than I thought.I had to return it and am looking for another digital that meets my requirements.
3,good watch but the numbers are small,"It is a good watch. But compared to some modern style, the numbers are small to read...."
3,Large size,The size is too large as it gets caught on my shirt sleeve all the time. The cheaper Casio models might be a better fit.
1,Too hard to read,"Hi, I just received the DW5600-E yesterday and am very disappointed. The display is small and hard to read. The digits are black on a dark gray background, just like the picture on this page. There is very little contrast. It gives me a headache to read the time in all but the brightest light. I doubt I will be wearing this watch very much. I wish I would have gotten one of the G Shocks with the auto backlight feature. That way, every time I tilt the watch to read it, it will light up for me."
2,The watch was too small for my wrist,"The watch seems like a good watch, but it was too small for my wrist so I can't wear it."
4,No More Accidental Button Pushes,Sick of always finding my cheap watches(ironman) in anything but the time mode and one final dead battery from sleeping on the backlite button sent me to the g-shock where accidentally depressing the buttons is practically impossible.Minus a star for all the garbage on the face which could have used a larger display instead.Amazon's $13 cheaper than wallyworld but the sales-chick was cute and showing some cleavage so what's a guy to do?After 40 days it's 13 seconds fast.
4,Christmas Gift Item,I brought this item as a gift for my son. He said he liked it and since I didn't have to return this gift I am going to go out on a limb and say that he did like it. That's the best I can do since it wasn't for me. So I rated it according to him saying that he liked it.
4,great watch,"My last G-Shock lastest only 13 years (with one battery repalcement). I read a complaint from another reviewer about this new G-Shock not having ""duel-time"", so I am unable to keep time in two time zones but I don't travel that much and when I do I can do the simple math to figure out what time it is. Plus changing the time on the watch isn't rocket science. I love the new light on the watch. The old one was alful but with this new one I can easily read the time no matter how dark it is outside. Great watch, very tough and relieable. Very water proof too. If you are tired of repolacing your ""ironman"" watches get this badboy and you won't be disappointed."
5,my favorite Casio G-shock watch,"This is my favorite G-shock watch, it is not atomic, not solar....but the battery lasts years and the watch is just about indestructible. The band keeper will go, but you can replace that with a cable tie....if the watch is in the water and sun a lot eventually the case plastic will crack....but this watch keeps on going....it is not gaudy like some of the Casio watches...it's appearance is understated....you could get by wearing this watch anywhere....buy it...you won't be sorry"
5,"Great watch, tough and dependable",I use this to work around the house. It keeps perfect time and does not seem to wear out.
4,Husband loves it,"I got this as a christmas gift for the hubs and he loves it. works like a charm! we've had it almost a year now and thing is still beautiful looking. Considering he's in the army liftening heavy things and constantly hitting it on things, it stuck to its shape. Awesome job!"
5,timeless design,"This is the classic sports watch, with a band that holds up to the toughest abuse. You will throw this watch out working because it looks so battle torn. tougher than Jethro's overalls!"
3,Durable watch with limited functionality,"I was looking for a durable, water-proof watch, and I decided to purchase the Casio Men's DW5600E G-Shock because of its good reviews. The watch works very well for displaying time, but it does have some functionality issues. When setting the time, a timer, or an alarm the numbers can only be increased. Since I regularly change the timer from 20 minutes to 10 minutes and back again, I would like to have a feature where I could decrease a 20 minute timer to a 10 minute timer without first increasing the timer to 59 minutes and cycling back around. Additionally the adjust button is slightly recessed and it is sometimes difficult to push.Since the watch is functional, but not exceptional, I am giving it a three star review."
4,Casio Watch,We were very pleased with the prompt arrival of the watch. My husband has been wearing a Casio for the past 25 years. They are very durable. I'm telling you he puts them to the test. I hope that this one will last as long as the last four. His only complaint so far is that the watch grabs the hairs on his wrist.
5,A great watch,"This watch is exactly what G Shock is based around-- making an unbreakable watch that tells time. I wear this watch to work everyday (welding). It has yet to fail me in the time that I have had it. It has some features, not as many as other G Shocks, but I like that about it. It has an alarm, a countdown timer, and a timer. It's elegance is its simplicity. This watch is a perfect watch for work, and a great beginner to the world of g Shocks."
5,Great Watch!,I wore this watch for 20 years in the Army and it never failed me. The item shipped quick and I was wearing it the same night it arrived. A must buy at this price.
4,DW5600E-1V Classic Review,"This is my second G-Shock replacing the DW9052-1V Classic, just because I didn't like the 9052's look. But anyways. This watch is cool. It's an old model so it's isn't that stylish compared to the newer G-Shocks, but I'm fine with it. What I really like about the G-Shocks are mainly that if you move your arm around, none of the buttons will press by itself and that has to be my all time favorite feature on the G-Shock. And secondly it looks really cool, the brand itself. And this particular model. Overall it's a sturdy watch to own, which is good."
5,Very nice strong watch,"I find This watch very smart and attractive, and quite comfortable to wear for a g-shock watch. I really like the classic retro 80's look of this watch too. It has obviously the time, alarm, countdown timer and stopwatch. all the digits are quite large and easy to see. It also has a nice aqua green glow for the backlight which stays on for a few seconds when the light button is released.I might just buy another one of these watches, since I'm starting a small watch collection, so I'll have 1 to wear and 1 on display, it looks great on display!I heard these watches are used by the military, and emergency services like police and firemen etc."
5,Nice simple watch,"If you want a simple digital watch, this is perfect. It also looks cool since it has a retro feel to it. I have a few g-shocks and this one is nice because it is not overwhelming"
4,Little smaller than original.,"I suspect things must change, and in this world of 'smaller is better', so it is with this watch. Of course my original was over 15 years old! (never changed the battery!). I checked my old one with calipers, and it seemed the new one had the same specs, but it is noticably thinner, and smaller overall, but not really enogh to matter. All functions the same. I guess it's just nostaliga for my old one that made the changes stand out."
3,Great Watch expect for 2 Drawbacks,"This is a great watch and I agree with almost everyone's comments. It is stylish, durable and highly reliable. But there are two main drawbacks that can be improved, one of which is Casio's fault and the other one is just a style issue.1) the edge between the watch face and the watch bands bends considerably and there is a tear emerging after a couple of months of use. This is more prominent if you have a thin wrist and use one of the shorter holes on the band.2) It is a bit too thick aesthetically. I know it is very durable and has a great protective casing but I feel it would look better in a thinner version."
2,Too hard to read!,The date is too small for my husband to read! The time is also a little hard to read. I will be returning this watch!
1,UNABLE TO READ TIME DUE TO GREY BACKGROUND,"Very dissatisfied... illustration in ad shows a lighter background allowing a sharp contrast with the digital numbers. In fact, the background is very grey in color and it is difficult to read the time. I cannot read time unless I get in plenty of light. Background should be as illustrated allowing greater contrast.DO NOT RECOMMEND....vjmarsala@comcast.net"
4,A Good Companion,"My second Casio G-Shock, it was dependable, tough, and discreet. Of course it was a sizable watch, nothing could hide that, but it needed the bulk to protect it's time-keeping core. And it did everything you could ask a watch to do. There's something to be said for a timepiece that you can hold out in a driving rainstorm while waiting for the bus. Tough goes beyond mere words."
5,TOUGH!!!!!,"I am a cook. I have been wearing this watch to work for the last 2 weeks. It comes in to contact with water,grease,chemicals,flour and various types of breading,various food juices, and gets knocked around a lot more than you would think. It has preformed flawlessly. I use the timer and stopwatch all the time since I usually have multiple thing cooking at same time.It has flour paste all over it and I just rinse it off under the faucet at full blast.I will try to give another review after a couple more months.Been about 2months now. Watch still looks new. I figured out I can take the soft rubber cover off with the 4 screws and clean the gunk that builds up in there. I do this about every other week. It has lost about 1/2 min. according to my atomic clock. Also I rub a little Armor All on the band and outside every once in a while."
5,My New Favorite Watch,"I was never a fan of digital watches until I bought this one.It has a classic style, and just the basic features that are useful in a watch--time/day/date; alarm; timer; stopwatch--without getting too complicated or looking too ridiculous with lots and lots of buttons, etc.The display is easy to read and the backlight is very bright. The black rubber/plastic finish is both durable and easy to clean. I have worn this watch in and around the ocean a number of times, and it still works great and required only a quick rinse to the remove dried salt and dirt.So far, it has been very durable, and useful, and the watch I wear more than any other."
3,Not for the slightly arthritic or big-fingered,"I like Casio watches. I needed to replace one that had served me well for years. Too bad for me that Casio has made changes in its design.In particular, on this model, the Adjust setting button, which is used for selecting the function you want, is slightly recessed and I simply cannot manipulate it easily with my fingertips. Either the mild arthritis I have isn't letting me be nimble enough or my fingers are too big. I can do it with a thumbnail if I get it just right or stylus, but not with my finger tip.Sorry, but that is not what I want.Styling is nice, though, and I still like Casio. Wound up with one of the humongous G-Shock models that has four big buttons.Jerry"
5,Great watch,"I've read nearly every review on Amazon about this watch and everyone was spot on about the watch. What I got was a great watch with no other fancy features that a lot of these new G-Shocks have (I own two other G-Shocks with those fancy features). Like a few other reviewers, the only downfall of this watch is the band. It's like if I don't put on and take off my watch with caution that it'll rip at any moment's notice. But I did pay $42 for a wonderful watch that I hope will last me for a LONG time, and the band can be replaced so that's the least of my worries. I am very satisfied with this watch!"
5,What can you say about the perfect watch?,"The only reason I had to purchase this watch, again, is because I lost my old one = (The Casio DW-5600E is the perfect watch for me, it's rugged, durable, and has exactly what I need, a reliable alarm clock! It hasn't failed me once yet, unlike the alarm on my cell phone. I'd recommend this watch to anyone looking for one to wear on a daily basis."
5,sick:),Cool watch I love it:D haseverything I need! I love the classic look its pretty slin compared to other bulky ones:)
4,Great Watch - Great Value,"I was looking for a watch for general wear and this one fills that requirement nicely. Although I have a small wrist (~7 in) this watch is not too big for my arm. Also, Amazon's price is $10 or so cheaper than that well know *Mart store."
5,G shock watch,Bought this as a surprise for my husband. He absolutely loves it. It arrived very quickly and was exactly what was pictured.
5,tough watch,Cheap tough simple .highly recommend. Slow postage 3 weeks .for the money I don't think there's a better watch out there .if there is let me know
4,good basic,"This is a very good basic take a beating won`t let you down watch. I like a cell phone that makes and receives call, THAT`s IT, And I like a watch that tells time and date. No faze of the moon no time in butholeastan. Plus the band is big enough for a big wrist. GOOD WATCH Almost a year now and I like this watch very much"
5,Jack of all trades,"I'm a GP. I wake up with this watch, wear it for work, in the gym, swimming and when doing DIY jobs at home and also at social occations. I've had one for 4 years, the band broke and I ordered another one after using the old one taped together for a few months :-)"
5,Great,"I have gone through 5 (I think) of these watches and many more watch bands... over the last 23 YEARS!!! 18 of those while working as a firefighter/paramedic, and NO, I did not take it off when I went into a fire... though it got hot enough to burn me once!!! LOLI have intention of switching anytime soon.PS, only get the Casio replacement bands, the cheaper ones are not worth it!!!"
5,"Simple, Effective...Perfect!","Just received this watch a few days ago. This is a no nonsense watch with basic features that most people will only ever use. It's slim, easy to read, and fits well on my wrist (I'm a bigger individual...6'1"" at 235 lbs). I love how the display has the day, date, and time at the same time. I also own a Suunto Vector, which is very bulky and useful for outdoor adventures...but for daily use, this Casio is perfect. I bought a G-Shock Riseman about a month ago and although it was a great watch with great features, I found that I didn't need all the features and bulk for daily usage. I returned the Riseman to a friend and bought this. Happy with my decision!"
3,"Light won't work while setting the alarm, etc...","I'll really date myself if I tell you how many years I've had these cheap casio watches, and find their sheer utility to be so unbeatable that fancy-schmansy expensive gold watches I have langish on a shelf. I've worn these watches to over 100 feet diving, banged and pounded them while doing all manner of rough chores, and had them last for a shocking number of years between battery changes, despite the abuse.Unfortunately, since the last model Casio G-Shock I had, Casio apparently changed the control buttons so that, in this model watch, you cannot work the light while you are setting the alarm, timer, or watch. This is a MISERABLE flaw since, for just one example, if you use the watch as an alarm clock, you have to get up out of bed and turn on the light to see the darn thing. Ditto for setting the timer countdown for ""snooze alarm"" purposes.If anyone knows of a G-Shock model where the face can be lit while setting it, I'd love to replace this one."
4,sports watch,"My first Casio sports watch lasted about 30 years so I thought I would try the g-shock watch. All works well except the button for the 'adjust' mode. The button is permanently depressed and is not easily used. You must use a sharp point, like the tip of a pen or stylus of a PDA, to push this button. This is NOT easy or convenient when you're out using it. I called Casio and the rep could not tell me if this was to be expected, normal or what. Otherwise, it's a great watch. Just keep a pen or one of your fingernails long and sharp to be able to use this key function of the watch."
5,Excellent Watch,"I have owned the Casio DW-5600E G-Shock Classic Watch for the past 5 or more years now. I've worn it every day in every condition from mountain climbing to river rafting to scuba diving to business boardrooms and it has always functioned perfectly. It seems at home in every situation. I rely on the easy to use features such as the stopwatch, countdown timer and alarm. It is the only travel alarm I take on trips and it has never failed me yet. My watch gains about 1 minute per month, so every 3 months or so I set it back to keep the time as accurate as possible. I highly recommend this watch."
5,Proven Tough,"Everyone has G-Shocks, like everyone has Wayfarers, and boat shoes. And if you don't have any of the aforementioned then you need to start by getting this true classic. Many of these classic products are making a comeback proving that their designs can withstand the test of time. With no doubt, this watch would definitely last a very long time. I personally use this watch for work and when I dress casual. Aside from the crease created from the lock, the watch looks like it's never been worn. It truly is tough and accurate. Many alternative and cheaper watches copy this iconic look of watches but nothing compares to the quality that is G-Shock."
5,Best watch i've ever owned,"You can't go wrong with this watch. It's got all the functions you need (alarm, stopwatch, countdown timer, light up screen) its easy to use, completely waterproof, stylish, all for a very reasonable price."
5,Rugged watch,This Casio watch G-Shock watch is rugged and keeps excellent time. It is a bit thicker than I prefer but it is an excellent every day watch.
3,casio watch,this watch has one setting smaller than the rest it not what its advertised to be but it works will not order again
4,solid watch,You won't win any fashion awards but you will be able to see it and run it right out of the box. It is also unlikely that you will destroy it. Very accurate time.
3,Casio made in China?,I had one of these back in the Eighty's when they first came out.I hope they are still made like they were
2,Predictable but entertaining,"I liked it, but it lacked something. Maybe it just needed a larger budget. The storyline was okay. The filming fair to good, not a low budget feel. I always enjoy an egyptian motiff."
1,HORRIBLE!,"As far as I can tell, this nail file does a decent job of filing--but I cant be sure because it's torture to use it! It feels like scratching your nails down a chalk board -- literally. Every time I try to use it, I get that unbearable cringe in my bones that only nails-on-a-chalkboard (especially when it's YOUR nails) can bring about. But not only does it FEEL awful, it actually MAKES that dreadful, squeaking sound too. Save your money (and your sanity) and go buy a less nerve-grating product."
2,Not the highest quality,"I received one of these as a gift. After opening it and testing it out, it clearly was defective. Luckily I was able to get the gift receipt and return it for a new one. After about a year of very light household usage, one of the bars on the LCD doesn't work.The manual was fairly sparse and could be a little better as well."
3,Fast delivery time but Jersey not what expected.,"Would have preferred a ""true replica"" as ones players wear have actual logo on front of jersey."
4,Images: 5 Stars Writing: 2 Stars,"This book has wonderful images that tell the story of Rodchenko.His photography, painting, drawing, graphic design and sculpture. What a kick [butt] artist. I like the photography and sculpture best.He was a contemporaryof Picasso, but he lived in Russia. His art was controlled bythe State. His fame rose with the State, and then declined whenthe State changed.I was interested in reading his biography and there are severalessays by different people. I found them hard to read and nothelpful and sequential. One essay was on Photography, one on Painting,one on each aspect of his output. This separation did not workfor me. I did not complete the essays, because, they were toohard to read. I liked the one written by his daughter."
5,One of the 2 books I've read twice,It's wonderful I couldn't but it down. This and the first book in this series are the best books I've ever read!
4,Excellent dip into Jane Austen's world.,"Most excellent. Correspondence flies between schoolmistress Goddard of Highbury and her married sister in London; between the insufferable Mrs. Elton and her sister of the renowned Maple Grove residence, between Captain Gordon and his married daughter. Familiar characters as well as new acquaintances mingle in this sequel to Jane Austen's Emma.A depth of knowledge relating to daily existence during the Regency period provides a solid background to this light fiction which also acts as a sequel to Austen-Leigh's previous novel, A Visit to Highbury (now out of print).Dialogue is exactly what one might expect of an Austen descendent. For example, Mrs. Goddard at a ball observes ""...alas, there are always too many pretty girls and not enough men at a ball. I do not know why that should be. But it is quite an immutable law.""Do not hesitate to give this to a young reader just discovering Jane Austen. Neither plot nor vocabulary should be cause for concern."
4,Great Book,"This was a great sequel to A Visit to Highbury/Another View of Emma. I loved it immensely. It was very entertaining and kept in the Jane Austen style. Everything was written as letters back and forth with the main characters Mrs. Goddard and Mrs. Pinkney (her sister). If you enjoy sequels to Jane Austens novels, this is a must read."
5,Joan Sutherland - The Art of the Prima Donna,"Joan Sutherland - The Art of the Prima Donna is the earliest recording with the amazing dramatic coloratura soprano and it is truly a gem. Sutherland sings the works of Arne, Handel, Bellini, Gounod, Verdi, Mozart, Thomas, Meyerbeer, Delibes and Rossini. The end result is nothing short of spectacular. The booklet contains well-written music notes by Alan Blyth and all the lyrics. Highly recommended indeed. 5/5."
2,Trained Seal?,"The problem with Sutherland was actually more serious than the ""poor diction"" mentioned by most critics. She seemed to have no concept whatsoever of opera as music drama. If you ignore the text in an opera, you cannot deal with issues of character or dramatic incident. You cannot even phrase musically. It is very easy to think of Sutherland more in terms of a circus act than as a musical artist. She was ""husbanded"" by Bonynge as a voice machine and never progressed. (Interestingly, listen to her 1959 Donna Anna under Giulini's guidance - she almost seems to be singing Italian. It's one of her rare fully ""operatic"" performances). The shame is that the voice fetishists ate it up, giving her no impetus to grow as an artist."
5,"""Voice of the Century""","Sutherland is the ""Voice of the Century"". Her ""Art of the PRima Donna"" is one of Decca's best selling recital for a coloratura ever.If you want to hear the most amazing display of vocal fireworks ever recorded. Buy this. You will not be disappointed.I even like it better than the legendary Norma and Lucia with La Stupenda."
4,Great information,It was a bit of a let down in that it was not as explecite as I thought it would be. Still it was good information.
2,This is an interview with Susan - it runs abt 15 minutes.,"This recording consists of an interview with Susan, running about 15 minutes in all. That's it.The interview is nicely filmed and sprinkled with brief snippets from her famous audition (the one we all saw on YouTube), some recording sessions, and her travels. The interview is preceded by a one-minute introduction of hideous visual quality and featuring background music from Carmina Burana.I paid $2.00 for my copy (used), and that's about what it's worth, assuming that you really like Susan."
2,only for shrek,I have a fairly large head (I wear a 7-1/2 fitted hat) and this is too large for my head. I am seriously dissatisfied.
3,Good Product,This is a good product for strengthening your neck. However I must warn you it is not by any means a one size fits all. I know my hat size and its 7 5/8. If you have bigger than this then this is right for you. I am able to make the product work for me as far as how it fits but it slides some when I use it. I would honestly suggest wearing a thermal cap underneath of it if you have my head size and want to make it fit better.
3,Adjustable Head Band would make this product better.,"This product works ok but, if the band around the head was adjustable it would be better."
3,It's good but not comfy,This item does what it's suppose to but It's not comfortable at all! I prefer if it was adjustable.
3,Design Flaw...,"Item arrived with a tag stating that ""one size fits all"". Apparently the normal size head is 3 inches bigger then mine. The construction and the material is storng. Overall, this product would be great if in someway, adjustments could be made so that it could fit securely on your head."
2,Have to Buy Head Developer First,"Before buying this product, I read the NUMEROUS reviews saying that it is way too big for the human head. I figured these reviews must have been written by people with small or medium-sized heads, that certainly no company would produce a neck developer too large for my own rather large head.Apparently you're supposed to use the head developer before you buy the neck developer, because only someone with an unnaturally large head would be able to use this product as demonstrated in the photo. I can kind of understand Everlast's position here: they don't want you to isolate the neck, neglect the head, and develop an uncomfortable disproportion between the two.If you don't intend to buy the head developer, you can still kind of use this product by carefully placing the straps or keeping them in place with your hand."
1,"Needs re-engineering...Good concept, Very bad design","The only reason this thing sells, is that people don't know it won't fit them. All Everlast has to do is add some adjustable straps to this to be able to size it, and beef up the metal hooks and this would work good. But they don't. My question is, just who at Everlast tested this product? They didn't have anywhere near a normal sized head!! I wonder if somewhere down the line their manufacturer didn't screw up on the measurements of this thing. Don't waste your money on it unless you have the time and tools to modify it. By the way, I never write reviews, this is my first one, that should tell you how bad this thing is."
3,not bad,"the neck developer is well made and very cheap but its not adjustable, and doesn't fit my 6ft 2 block head, so i have to hold the straps when using it"
3,Nylon head strap..,"Good enough product for its purpose, but I'm not sure about the ""one size fits most"" idea. I feel like most humans have relatively similar sized dome-pieces, and this thing is pretty generously sized. Yea, it's actually pretty gaping, and it falls down to around my eyes. Maybe I can just wear a helmet while I use it??"
1,"One size fits ""MOST"" Ogres!!!!",This thing is so huge that SHREK would have trouble keeping it on his head!!! I am not a small man and my dome is about a 7 1/2 hat size. That being said this thing is still huge! It is so big in fact that my head slips in between the slots of the front/back and center strap. I have to wear a knit cap just to make it stay!! All that and it still does what it supposed to do. Just be wary of the size.
3,I have a big head.,"I have a big head and it fits like a glove. Literally.a strap would be nice.The chain it came with is also a bit large in the S hook area. too much slack and it will disconnect. Tightened it down a tad with some pliers.An instruction pamphlet would have been a nice touch, as to what different exercises you can preform with it so it gets a 3.Good quality, light foam on all inner parts of headband,all black,Makes an excellent home defense weapon as well with a weight attached."
2,good for beginners only,"I was dissapointed with the construction of this head harness.the stitching started to rip with only a 40 pound load.the sizing was alright, only a little slack - which was easy to pad with a beanie."
1,Awful product.,"#1 problem is that it is indeed pretty big. I have a big head and it still fit too loosely on me... but I can work with that. The MAIN problem is that I put it on for the very first time with actual weight (a 45lb plate) and it straight up ripped.What kind of person is this designed for? Obviously a guy with a great big Shrek head but can only lift a 10lb plate with it. Yeah, makes perfect sense. Picture Mr Mackey from South Park. DO NOT BUY THIS JUNK."
2,would have been nice if you could adjust it.,Bottom line is this would have been a good product if you can adjust it but you cant. I were a size 7 5/8 to 7 3/4 in a fitted cap and this thing is way too big for my head. After folding a large towel on my head and then placing it on my head on the towel it was then ok at best and did work for the simple up down motion. It really not worth the price and am not sure what group of people this was tested on because some people think I have a big head so I dont see how this fits most heads unless you have a helmet for a head. Oh and without the towel it will dig into your head like its trying to reach your brain.
1,Way to big for a full grown man's head!,"If you happen to have a head the size of a watermelon this is the perfect thing for you. Unfortunatly if your head is not oversized this thing is going to slide all over the place. Great price, great idea, bad design. Don't buy."
1,Badly Designed,"I bought the Everlast Neck Developer today from a UK store. I wish I hadn't bothered. The S hook that is supposed to go through a hole in a standard diameter weight disc, is too big to do so. The hook is made too wide and won't fit through. I'm not surprised that the advertising photos I've seen for this product don't ever show it with weights attached. You'd need to put it in a vice or use a pair of pliers to squeeze the hook until it's narrower. I'd rather just return it to the shop.I should have known really. Most Everlast products I've ever bought before were cheap rubbish and had to be returned to the store.This product deserves no stars. Don't buy this product!!"
3,Decent starter for the price,"For the price, this is a good piece of equipment for anyone just starting working out the neck muscles. It takes a bit of skill and patience to learn the movements, as it will no doubt be awkward at first if you've never done it, but that goes for any neck harness. If you find out you like this sort of thing, you can then move on to a better piece of equipment like they have at ironmind.A lot of reviews here complain that the strap is too large. You can layer on winter hat(s) or towels to fit; it makes it more comfortable too.Some reviews also claim that it has torn at 45 lbs. I have been repping up to 50 lbs with no problem. I don't know how much more it can handle, but my guess is not much more. I advise to wear steel tipped boots when using it in a front raise as a precaution."
2,Dissapointed when it finally broke,"Had this thing for about 6 months and it finally gave way. The strap with the attachment on it broke. No way to fix it, the stitching broke and the rubber flimsy insulating strap inside the strap snapped. Another problem I had was that this thing was just too big for my head. This could have been the problem , that the weight was not distributed evenly through the straps. But all in all it was great getting to use this and getting to know this product. I have definately strengthened my neck with it and am happy with the results but not satisfied. I am currently looking for something a little more flexible for side to side neck strengthening. I was only able to do front and back neck exercises because the thing was so big I couldnt do anything else."
1,Bad advice,I felt this man's dislike of the medical field from page one and I will not allow another's negative and personal feelings challenge my success. Thank goodness I did treatment!
1,"Please, Please don't do this","Please don't kill yourself and follow this book. I have 2 adoptive daughters who have Hep B. One has a Hep D co-infection and is following the Hep C treatment which is interferon. Interferon cures about 70% of Hep C patients, so you do have treatment options. Milk thistle and other herbs just don't do anything, no matter what this quack says. There is no conspiracy. Hep C like all chronic hepatitis cases has a spontaneous cure rate meaning the body will cure the virus by itself. Nothing in this book changes the spontaneous cure rate. So there is lots of anecdotal evidence of cures but these ""cures"" are just not caused by anything this book recommends.I know a diagnosis of Hepatitis is a scary thing. There are some great books on living with Hepatitis and managing the condition, this is not one of them. See your doctor, follow her advice, eat right, get some exercise, enjoy life, and do not buy this book."
5,"Parsifal, 1962 Bayreuth Festival","It's the definitive recording; better than '51. Unfortunately, the original Phillips five LP set was an audio debacle: maybe one of the worst (most shallow) pressings ever released by a major label. I have that original set as proof. But it was later remastered, and the sound just shimmers. The Act One Vorspiel, remarkably urgent for Kna, glows, the balances just right. Hotter considers this his best recorded performance, with few traces of the asthmatic struggles he suffered 3 years later in the Solti ""Walkure."" George London has a raspy edge, a vocal bite that works perfectly: ""Erbarmen -- ach Erbarmen!"" Neidlinger is his usual maniacal self. While Jess Thomas and Irene Dallis are surprisingly marked-down, introverted, yet psychologically perfect for the marked-down ambience of the Festspielhaus."
4,Fine rendition of Folk and Classical,"I first encountered Barolk Folk in the early 1990s, and have recently renewed the aquaintance. BK is a small ensemble of classically trained musicians (""chamber folk group"") doing both traditional celtic music, and Mozart, Gluck, Bach, etc. on dulcimer, recorder, guitar, and strings. This particular CD contains Mozart, lesser known Baroque composers, Carolan, and a pleasant mix of Irish/Scottish music.This is very pleasant, fun music, appropriate for reading, dancing (I guess), or just listening. Too bad that this CD is no longer available new, but I urge any celtic music / Bach and Mozart fan to pick it up used, or try one of their other CD's."
5,It only takes one person willing to change to save a marriag,"This book, If Only You Would change, by Mark Luciano & Christopher Merris provides valuable tools for anyone caught in what seems to be a hopeless relationship. It will not help you fix the other person but will allow you to gain strength within yourself and to grow beyond a fixation with the other person's character defects. Based strongly on the Twelve Step program it pulls no punches in its approach to the ""real problems"" and solutions. Both partners do not have to be involved in the program for the relationship to gain greatly and perhaps be saved from divorce. The book also could be used to counsel couples heading into marriage relationships. It is a must for all counsellors, pastors, and married couples."
5,Motorcraft Tie Rod Adjusting Sleeve,"I bought these for my Crown Victoria. They are genuine Motorcraft, and a perfect fit. The box says, ""Made in Japan."" Even though I'd prefer made in USA or Canada I'm ok with this as the Japanese are known for making quality auto parts."
1,Laxative cookies,"I thought I was getting sugar free cookies, and I like cookies. So, I ate 5 cookies. They're pretty small. Anyway, I woke up in the middle of the night in tears with my belly all swollen huge and had to run the bathroom. I had diarrhea for two days after that.On the packaging is says serving size 3 cookies and then it says *EXCESS CONSUMPTION MAY HAVE A LAXATIVE EFFECT.Excess consumption?It's not like I ate the whole package.......Then, I thought well, maybe if I just have three then it'll be alright. But then I had to run to the bathroom every couple of hours for almost 24 hours. I hope for the sake of their business it doesn't affect everyone like this."
5,A really cool book,"I picked up a copy of this book and was pleasantly surprised. It's really, really good! I think everyone will enjoy the country flavor, characterization and the excitement. Normal Mullins has created a masterpiece."
4,Freaked...,"I first saw this flick on HBO and I must say I died laughing. Alex Winters is great as is...that guy...ya know, that guy from Blossom. Anyhow, the movie is terrific, as would be anything involving my hero and everyone's role model, MR. T"
1,the international version doesn't have english audio like it says it does,"I ordered this version of Freaked or a.k.a Hideous Mutant Freaks from this other site to only get refunded because of complaints from customers complaining this international version (which is unrated vs the pg13 version here in the states) which promises english audio in fact doesn't have it. I don't know if the seller shipped the product but I will try it out before sending it back because I bought the pg13 version and report my findings here. But, so far all I heard that the english audio is a misprint. If you have any information write a review. What I'm wondering is if there is an unrated version of this movie why hasn't it been put on yet or why put out a pg13 version when you can put out an R version? However, If you ever seen this movie, it's a classic."
2,This movie is a bad as it gets,"I can't believe Hollywood would make such a film as Freaked. It should be called ""Boring"", and a waste of time and money.Their is no plot, and it just rambles along. The Attack of the Killer Tomatoes at least had some suspense to it. Despite the big name actors in this --it goes nowhere. If you like movies made for celebral pygmies then maybe you like Freaked."
5,Underrated genre comedy is fun stuff.,"Freaked was the only good part of ten years of Cinemax. It's an odd movie, and by few scales is it actually a good one; but it's amusing, it's quirky, its cast is impressive, and I still consider it one of my favorite movies of all time. (Of course, nobody agrees with me...)"
5,this movie kicks,this movie absolutly hilarious and great special fx. i remember watching it a couple years ago and i thought i was the only person who heard of it but i guess im wrong.i highly recomend this movie.
4,freaky funny,"Absolutely hilarious!!!!! The best, and I mean best comedy in a while.....Only Baseketball might compare....Screw ""There's Something about Mary"" and rent this under-rated gem instead!"
3,Disappointing,"Perhaps I expected too much out of this movie after reading all the glowing reviews. I bought a copy without renting first and got reminded of why I normally rent first. There are a few enjoyable moments and characters, like the machine gun toting eyeballs or the fighting milkmen or the Hollywood Squares bit, but mostly the movie was very predictable and the so called ""zannyness"" was on the inane side.If you want a good movie in this genre, try ""Toxic Avenger""."
5,This is the funniest film that nobody really saw.,Today at work I was thinking about this film and I started laughing out loud when I remembered the part about the wrench that was turned into a hammer. All the customers in my store looked at me like I was a freak. This movie never really got it's moment in the sun. If it had there would definetly allready be a dvd for it. Come on FOX!!!!!!!! Your killing me over here.
3,Good for Beginners,"This is my 1st year to pursue blacksmithing. I have read a number of books on the subject, but I am not a seasoned smith.I have seen recommendations for this book several places on-line, so I had high hopes. The book starts by identifying the tools, then covers a few basic projects, adds some metallurgy information, then we get a portfolio of beautiful works by Master Craftsmen. The section on performing a spark test using a grinder could have used some color photos. I would have liked a few more projects, and maybe a few more drawings.The book was good as far as it went, although the edition that I received in 2006 had several awkwardly phrased sentences. It was almost as if the writer was interrupted in mid sentence, or went back to edit a sentence and left extra words in.For my own library, I will keep this book, but I am still looking ..."
2,MTV style garbage,"I just listened to about 6 songs and have become angry. This is a classic rock band but you cant just watch the band. You have to sit through MTV style camera work and going off into tangents like street scenes buildings, children faces etc. NOT THE BAND! PHOOEY. Songs were cut off for interviews and stupidity. I JUST WANT THE CONCERT! The cameraman tries to be the star and he failed miserably. The only reason I gave this 2 stars is that when the music is playing and Im not looking at the screen, it sounds good."
3,Nueva Cocina Picadillo seasoning,"was just ok. think they must have changed the recipe as this was way better a few years ago. I would not buy again, will try to find a good picadillo recipe."
5,Perfectly Cuban,"This is simply delecious and fast to make. I made it with ground turkey and it gave it a twist that made my whole family ask for seconds. Another time I made it with organic ground chicken and served it in lettuce leaves as lettuce wraps and it was awesome. My last attempt was again with ground turkey and I used it as the seasoning for my meatloaf....... OMG it was mouth watering! The more creative I get, the better it tastes."
1,Más de lo mismo,"El problema con los libros de este autor es que todos se vuelven la misma sucesión de aventuras pornoráficas y grotescas. No tengo nada contra el género, pero el problema es la repetición, libro tras libro, de lo mismo: drogas, mujeres y bajos fondos. Ninguno de sus libros se diferencia del otro... al menos, los que he leido hasta ahora (y ya voy por tres). No estooy segura si seguiré intentando seguirmelo leyendo hasta que alguien me cuente que realmente hizo un libro nuevo, y no un refrito de los anteriores."
1,terrible,"Sound is very uneven. At times volume is so low I must turn it up considerably, then all of a sudden I get blasted when the music gets louder. I have to keep my fingers on the volume control & be ready for a quick adjustment. This is a horrible recording."
4,good product,i recieved my order fairly quickly and they make a big difference in my car..for a trusted name brand the amazon price was very good so i would recommend to definitely take a look on amazon first if youre looking for replacement parts at a great price
1,Disappointing,"If I had known how anticlimactically this book would end, I wouldn't have wasted any time on reading it. I was hoping to learn how the author discovered that her religion was based on a false foundation and what effects that discovery had on her. Instead it turns out that she ran out of passion for her hardworking and apparently very decent husband and decided to divorce him, after letting him put her through seven years of school. In order to reconcile this decision with her conscience, she had to dump ""God"" too. A more feeble reason for giving up a religion that has been the framework of one's life for twenty years can hardly be imagined.My other sentiments concerning this book have already been ably expressed by other reviewers, and I should perhaps add that I am an atheist."
4,Comparison of This Dark World to the movie Higher Ground,"The memoir was interesting and gave much information that wasn't included in the movie, Higher Ground. As a Christian, it appeared to me that a group that is heavily works related in emphesis can be destructive to faith in some cases. I found the movie presentation to be troubling because I was left in doubt as to her faith in God at the movies' end. However, the book seemed to leave little doubt at its conclusion that she had given up belief in God."
5,Magnifier Desk Lamp,This is just what I wanted. The light is portable and can be moved easily if needed. Has just enough light so as not to glare and the joints are easy to use. It is also heavy and will not tip. Great product.
5,stories of unease,"who was melville? how could he write with such insight that it speaks to us a century and a half later with such strength?bartleby is depressed, or showing ""passive resistance"" to a world he can't conform to. unable to fathom this behavior, his nameless employer is driven to hilarious and tragic ends to escape the irresistable force of bartleby's ""i would prefer not"".benito cereno uses the microcosm of a ship to model the tensions of slavery. while melville's language is certainly racist, and the story doesn't come out as a condemnation, the sick feeling this story creates is enough."
5,really makes you think...,"This book is a fascinating journey into the mind of a genious (Melville). The main character, Bartleby, makes the deliberate choice to not participate in societal expectations. The only thing you ever hear him say is ""I prefer not to."" It is humerous, yet sad. You can not feel sorry for Bartleby though; he is living life on his terms. I compare this to Emerson's ""Walden Pond."" In the same way that Emerson choose to live in the woods, Bartleby choose to live life in his own unique way. Call him crazy, but I think that this book is about sanity in an insane world."
5,Benito Cereno,"I didn't read the first story, but I read the second (Benito Cereno). It is about a slave ship that comes into a port in central America, and when an American sea captain goes aboard to offer gifts, he notices strange things happening on board. This story is thrilling and I loved it. Things keep happening during the story that make the reader go ""what?"" ""huh?"" (in a good way, because it makes you interested in what happened). I couldn't put this book down. The language may be a little hard to understand, and the reader also must look closely at everything Melville says in order to understand what is going on (even though it's not in the least like deciphering a poem). I recommend this to avid readers."
4,Enjoy the Love,"Ignore some of the bad reviews given by orangeduke and elia. They are clueless.Sometimes the greatest beauty can be found in simplicity. Although I enjoy complicated soundscapes, this CD is honest in its' beats. Most of all, it grows on you. I went from thinking it was an O.K. album the first time I heard it to now being amazed at it. Those are the best albums. The ones you enjoy better the 20th time you've played them. I admit, I could have easily put this CD away and just forgotten about it after I heard it the first time. Give it a chance."
4,As a DJ there's very few other crowd movers..,"Westbam, being around for as long as he has, knows what people feel.. He knows what kind of bass beat people will move to.. And music is about feeling.. Slap on this album, turn it up, and let him move you.. It can't be helped.."
5,The rare techno record that's catchy,"It's so rare these days for techno albums to have any pop sensibility at all. I'm all for being modern and cutting-edge, but the first twenty seconds of ""staying alive"" destroy virtually all techno. But this album cops a little from the brothers gibb, and a little from kraftwerk, and lo and behold, a technno album that gets you shaking your booty and humming along. A keeper."
4,Real life - but a gripping story,For a human face on Apartheid. Read it if you want to explore idealism. Reading this book makes one think of the wellsprings of commitment to a cause. It is sufficiently engrossing that it is possible to imagine why one would join in to try and change an unjust society.
1,Good?,"I just wonder one thing..... all of you people who thinks this book is good and that it gives a true account of what really happened, don't you think it's quite telling that the only one who has NOT written a book on Freddie is Mary Austin? She is the only one who has actually kept the secrecy he wanted and not tried to cash in. I first thought that it might be intresting to read this book because I am a big fan, but I later realised that if I truly admire his music and his creativity, I don't need to know everything about his private life. And if you truly love someone, you don't have to go and write a book about them splashing out all horrible details about them. Jim did obviously not like the fact that the house went to Mary and that the place of his burial was left only to her, but he must have known that she would be the only one to honour his wishes and she has, his other ""friends"" and lovers more than ready to share everything intimate."
5,A Really good read for Mercury fans...,"What a great book.. Poor guy's been through alot. I agree with whats been said by others, as this was a way for him to grieve his loss and remember his lover and friend...warts and all. Phoebe himself wrote that Jim was an honest man and that he was sure that he'd tell the real story ( see foreword ). Thank-you Jim for this and may you both Rest in Peace.Mercury and Me"
1,A review on a book I have not read and with good reason!,"I don't think that Freddie Mercury would have liked the fact that one of his lovers would write a book about him in shocking detail. Freddie was a very private person and would have been furious if people all over the world knew the private details of his life and last moments. I find the whole idea of even writing a book about him completely disrespectful. It is because of his beautiful art and powerful voice that we should remember him and hold him dear to our hearts. Freddie deserves respect in death, and I think his former lover did him a disservice writing this piece of obvious trash. I will not be buying this book, and if you are a true fan, you won't either."
1,Hated it!,"When this book came out, a friend bought it for me. I read it within about 2 hours and proceeded to throw it across the room. It was written poorly and I felt, written to gain a buck from the tragic death of Freddie. I found myself questioning if the author was telling the truth. Since Freddie is gone, we obviously can't ask him; I will stick with my original thought that the author is a 'hanger-on' who only wanted money. If the author truly knew Freddie, he would NEVER have written a book about the personal life of a very private man; Freddie would not have approved."
1,Mercury and Me by Jim Hutton,"Freddie and Me, June 30, 2009By Zahira Andujar ""zandujar"" (PR) - See all my reviewsAs I was reading first Freddie Mercury will be upset about this book. At the end, a man who gives so much, I think they should not take good care of him in last days for example the cleaning manteinance, bath him as he like frequently, and the worst they let him had the wet bed and also they had doubt in change it, if Freddie can talk that time, I know he scream and put all of them out of his home. They seem just want the Garden Lodge, and the gardener seems cold heart. Very sad story Freddy Mercury give a lot and the others just take. I think he really love Mary and she did very good at the end put all of them out of Freddie home. None of them really cried from heart, only thinking where they will go? Not missing him at all, only missing the good life."
2,Truth or false?,"Starting reading this book it seemed really interesting - what the reader can't understand is how, since the author keeps mentioning how Freddie Mercury cherised his privacy, the book is full of detailed descriptions of the most private actions of Mercury! This doesn't show that much respect to his memory... Since Hutton knew how much Freddie liked to keep his privacy he should have respected this wish of his eventhough he has been dead six years now. Also, many people including the surviving members of Queen, mention that the book contains lots of mistakes and false events - especially concerning Mary Austin's, Freddie's lifelong friend, behaviour.A book for the author to get money as it seems, unfortunately, unless of course there are things we don't know."
3,"the ""ME"" part",Whoah....that guy is bloody beautiful! What is he doing with that urchin Freddie Mercury??
1,Shameful ~ Two Thumbs Down!!,"What an incredible insult to Freddie!! By revealing details of their so-called ""private"" relationship, Hutton quite clearly shows that his respect for Freddie was, indeed, nil. Freddie, so noted for cherishing his privacy, has been horribly insulted by his ex-lover via this book. Oh wait...the book does illuminate one item flawlessly: that Jim Hutton was a self serving and envious jerk!! His insane jealousy of (heterosexual) Mary Austin, the love of Freddie's life, couldn't be more evident. Five stars, Mr. Hutton, for achieving ""Ultra Tacky"" status. Given to me as a gift, I skimmed through it, felt really bad for Fred, then gave this bog roll a proper ""burial"" by tossing it out with a garbage bag full of used cat litter. ;)"
1,This movie is terrible. It's really no stars.,The fight scenes in this movie are far from believable. The female lead in this movie she fights so very slow she should have died at least 30 time. The camera I suppose was used by a hand held video camera it was that bad. I'm an asian movie fan and this movie is so bad I don't know how some people liked it. And I'm sorry but there is a raped scene in this movie which ADV films make fun of in there own personilized english dubbed. I won't go into details about that scene cause what they did was sick. And the fight scenes the ninjas are runnig around screaming like a pack of monkies. If you see it after reading this then I guess that's your problem.
5,If you like good music.....,This is one of the best CDs I've ever had the pleasure of listening to. No two songs sound alike. Her easy style is a refreshing change to the cookie-cutter music being performed today by many similar sounding groups.
4,The title says it all.,"This is the first recording of Randy Crawford's that I've purchased. Some of the songs had to grow on me. I'm still not thrilled about all the songs but there are several that I can listen to over and over and over e.g. Bye Bye, Are You Sure, I'd Be An Angel, Hymn of the Big Wheel, Breaking Down. I thoroughly enjoy the tape every time I listen. It stirs up many different moods especially one of my favorites-- the ups and downs of romantic relationships."
3,Nice but Randy has done better.....it GROWS on you.,"When the CD was first released I immediately purchased it without even thinking about it based on her previous work. I can not tell you how disappointed I was after listening to it. I couldn't believe what a miss. But Randy has a such a sweet clear voice, unmuddied by lots of useless intonations that I listened to it again just to hear the voice plus I had bought the darn thing. Lo and behold a couple of tunes seemed a little more palatable. Needless to say it has definitely grown on me and I now have a couple of tracks I like. So give it a chance and let Randy's voice do the convincing."
4,A beloved classic showing its age,"This was the first Rosenkavalier I ever heard, some forty years ago, and I must have gone to the library ten times to listen through earphones to it. But on reacquaintance I must say that the mono sound is more than a bit edgy and shallow. When reviewers say that Maria Reining is past her prime, I think it should be clarified; her voice is mature but still beautiful--she's a Marschallin well into her forties. Of course, if you love something, you love it as a whole. On the whole I still love Kleiber's conducting, which is so clear and unsentimental (insofar as that's possible amidst so much strawberries and cream), and even more I love the touching reminder of old vienna before the horrors of WW II descended and destroyed a golden illusion."
3,A few good recipes,"I wouldn't say spectacular, so a little disappointing. I am new to steaming and was expecting more. She gives a good basic overview of steaming, so I did appreciate the introduction. My favorite recipe is the baby back ribs; the barbeque sauce was very-very good and the ribs were excellent..a real keeper. The fish steams well but recipes I tried lacked preseasoning except for a little salting before cooking. It got me started anyway and I'm interested in finding more recipes that use marinades to enhance flavors of steamed meats and fish."
2,Disappointed,"I was so excited to get this book. I looked through the pages expecting to see alot of recipes that I would make, but I didn't even see one that sounded good. It received good reviews so I was pretty disappointed. I bought a steamer for cooking vegetables but I'll have to experiment on my own cooking everything else. I think I am a pretty good home cook, so this seemed a little plain or basic for me, just not what I was expecting. The seller was great though, I received the book on time."
3,Eh,"I'm not UNhappy with this. I should have thought longer before getting a book to do something I already know how to do. I use it for reference, though. So, it's what it says. I may find it more helpful as I have it longer, though. Not fair to judge it, yet. They want these ratings so fast."
3,animal videos not inspiring,"For Carnival of the Animals, videos were filmed at zoos or nature parks, general shots. Seems they could have bought stock nature footage. The music has a lot of personality to each animal, or fossil, and they missed the mark on timing movements and music. Could have been very amusing. My elderly mother enjoyed it however."
5,"Captivating ""Carnival""","My 3 year old grandson calls this one ""Animal Planick,"" and he loves to watch the beautiful scenes with lions, elephants, tortoises, etc. This video is a wonderful way to share Saint-Saens' and Bizet's beautiful music with children. I enjoy it too!"
1,In Brightest Africa,The content of the book is not at issue. The printing of it is. It is one giant RUN ON SENTENCE!!! The intro by the publisher excused this by describing the automated OCR scanning used on an original copy. The entire process is automated. NO ATTEMPT WAS MADE TO CORRECT THE RESULTING ERRORS!!!!The printed copy is a TRAVESTY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,dog slipper,my dog loves itplays all time with ityes I would recommened this to all dog loverssqueaker in it helps dog play with it
3,"Very Kute, but not good for a dog who loves to chew","This is such a kute slipper, but my 20 lb cockapoo is an avid chewer and destroys any stuffed toy around. I'm sure you know your dog well enough to know if this is fit for him or her. If he or she is known to kill their stuffed toys, then don't buy this for him/her. Your money will go down the drain, it will defeat the whole purpose in buying it in the first place, and your dog can choke from the stuffing. It's a kute toy. Love it, but don't get it if your dog is an avid chewer like mine. LOL"
2,NOT EXACTLY ULTRADEV...,"Well, I bought this book and has anxious to see what it looked like. Unifortunately, I bought it to learn about Ultra Dev and had to reach the half of it and still be on how I define a site on Dreamweaver.It's a good begginer book for those that have no clue what Web Development is..If you are already into it you will have to pass the middle of it to start reading about UD. The author is practical and surely knows his lesson but by selling a book on ultradev I would have expected more on it. Even some practical examples on e-learning are so limiting as he speaks only for quizes and that's it..So if you want something great this book will disappoint you. But if you want something to start with dynamic pages is easy to start. For its money though I would buy something better that covers everything. See..UD-The Complete Reference..Good luck.."
4,A comprehensive clear textbook for international economics,"An comprehensive review of the major issues in international micro economics including the gains from trade, intra/interindustry trade, trade policy and distortions, customs unions, GATT, import subsitution, and macro economic aspects. This book covers the main economic theories, and has a nice political flavour. Although Postgraduate level, the theory is explained with sufficient clarity for non economists and undergraduates to comprehend the main theories. The text flows very well, and the mathematics is limited to the essential places. Well written."
5,Bach Cello Suites played with Gusto,"Janos Starker is extrodinary, and then you add Bachs most callenging and passionate work the cello suites. Starker has an excellent understanding of the dymanics of Bach and the compexity of the cello suites. His technique is flawless. He brings passion to each note. As well he understands when to emphize and when to hold bach on the musical phrasing of the piece.I would say that this is a much more complex and exciting version of Bach than Yo-Yo Ma's recording. Starker uses vibarto when needed and called for while Ma falls back on it and over uses this technique detracting from the music.This is one of my top five classical recordings that I own the other include Stavinsky's Firebirds Recorded by the Chicago Symphony, Maria Callus singing Bizets Carmen, Bachs Paratia's and Viloin Suites recored by Perlman and Mozarts Great Mass in C."
1,Stop-and-Go Performance,"This cellist has a habit of placing abrupt breaks in the music at inopportune moments, creating little rhythmic hitches and compromising the overall flow of the performance."
4,Pulp action.,"The entire Mack Bolan series is simply pulp action. It is a big strong hero who knows what has to be done and he goes and does it. He doesn't have many weaknesses and he destroys everything that stands in his way.Those are the rules. The plots of these stories are often thin, some of the characters two dimensional and the action a little over the top. But that is what it is all about.I do not go into reading one of these expecting "" Tinker, taylor soldier spy."" These books are not gritty true to life spy drama. They are action/adventure with a healthy does of action.But it is refreshing when they come up with a good concept, where the plot isn't too weak and the action moves with the plot and not as a subsitution for one. I found this story one of the better ones of the series. I hope that they do more of this calibure."
5,Contemporary Appalachian Cooking,"Luckily for twenty-first century cooks, the trend in cookbooks is to contextualize. Where is the recipe from? How has it been adapted for the American cook? What is the history of this food? As a fan of Mark Sohn's food writing, I can attest to the fact that he's been doing this for fifteen years. His most recent book takes contextualization to a whole new level. By the end of the first section you feel like you've walked up the hollers of Central Appalachia and tasted the food made over the years.In addition to the food culture and history, the book is packed with signature Sohn recipes-easy to follow and concise. There are no extra steps in the Chocolate Gravy recipe and you know just how long it is going to take from start to finish.As an avid cookbook reader and lover of Appalachian culture, Appalachian Home Cooking adds a whole new layer to my understanding of the region."
3,"Great Reference, but Awkward Reading","Appalachian Home Cooking is a great book if you've always wondered where families originated in their enjoyment of cushaw pie and (flat) chicken and dumplings. The book is very useful for reference, but it reads awkwardly and is sometimes unclear in correlations between foods and ethnicity. In addition, there doesn't appear to be much new information in the book; mostly its conjecture and reciting of other book sources. I recommend this book if you are looking for an old appalachian recipe and are interested in the correlation between land, people, climate, culture, and food."
2,Cheap and good for a general idea of how fat you are.,"Well, as mentioned before, it's not a very accurate scale. Actually it could be accurate but it fluctuates too much depending on where on the scale you stand, and how you shift your weight. It can fluctuate 5lbs in either direction. So I wouldn't recommend it for weekly weigh-ins at all. If you are just casually curious how much you weigh and don't want to pay very much then go for it."
1,unreliable scale in the making,"I purchased this scale only to find out that the scale is completely off. It does measure your body weight... 5 to 10 pounds off. And it doesn't matter if you turn the balancing knob, it still be off."
4,Beyond Barbed Wire/Go For Broke,"Good historical documentary on the World War II Internment camps established by the U.S. government under the questionable guise of ""military necessity."" Also, information about the 442nd regimental combat ballationand its role in the course of World War II and on the Japanese-American citizens held in the Internment camps."
1,Farewell to Manzanar historical perspective,This was a little too dry for my intent. I had difficulty staying focused. I am sure my high school students would find it quite soporific!
1,What a horrible movie!!!!,"I wish I could have given this movie zero stars. It was the most boring, stupid, horrible movie ever!!!Don't watch this one! It is a waste of time and money!!"
2,"Nice box cover, but a big let down quality wise :(","Here's a low budget film that just doesn't cut it. The first scene introduces the poor acting and the bad choice in 16mm film stock. Whatever stock they chose, it was the absolute worst choice for dark scenes!The acting does get better as the movie slowly moves along, but it's not enough to save the viewer from cringing at the horrible cinematography, bad audio, and the cheap finale to the story (although, quite disturbing). There are much better thrillers shot on 16mm than this... try ""Primer"", ""Freak"", and don't forget the classic ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre""!The biggest downfall here is the poor choice of film stock for this type of story. The grain in the dark scenes really gets in the way of the storytelling. This film could have earned 3 stars if it was shot on a VHS tape, even!"
2,"Headed for the trash, sorry.","A few good wave shots intermingled with useless airel views of waves (too high), also some seals, birds, a cow, and a train (close up). This is not the relaxing wave video I had hoped it would be, the music is high pitched twanging, so it is better with wave sounds, when there are any. Very disappointed."
5,Loving Logic,"Gridworks is one of my gift suggestions at [...]Sharpen your logical thinking skills with Gridworks! Working through this series of challenges, from warm-up to expert, will boost your skills and your confidence. As you consider the given visual clues, both positive and negative, you move magnets to fill in the grid correctly. This spiral bound book is ideal to take on the road. I bought this book as a gift for our 7th grader, but the younger kids (and adults) were just as eager to work through it when he finished. Complete the grid. Deduce the answer! You will learn to love logic."
3,Good entry level book on military aviation,"Good overview on the technical aspects of flight & the integration into the military structure. Provides a good review of the the difficulties encountered during the inter-war period of the 1920s & 1930s. The book undervalued the importance of logistics during the WWII Pacific Campaign because it was ""boring"". Good book for readers who are looking for an overview without too much detail."
3,A useful resource,"This book provides concise study guides for about 30 Old Testament types an their New Testament antitypes. It is useful for connecting OT events with NT teaching. Each 4 to 6 page chapter includes brief discussion of a type, and a side-by-side table showing the relevant OT and NT verses."
2,Not my fave.....,"It really goes to show how performances can make or break a recording. If you're going to have someone carry a musical please make sure he can sing. This Jesus cannot sing. As a whole I actually prefer rock singers to musical theatre singers (especially for this particular show) and even as a rock singer his technique is crap. This is really just my opinion, others may think he's great. But his performance alone made this CD a turn off for me. The Judas is just kind of so-so and the orchestrations are pretty basic."
5,"A powerful, enduring version of the show!","Reading other reviews I was shocked to find my favorite version of this classic hated by others. Having first heard JCS from the record that my father had I knew only this version at first. It was great. Next came the film for me and I have to say that it was a great dissapointment for me. Suddenly all the passion in the characters was gone. The Christ was no longer being portrayed as an upset man trying to make those around him understand what he was doing, but no more than a confused minor figure in the show. THe concept version while passable still lacks the rhythmic intensity and passionate drive that encompasses this version. In summary, to fully experence what Webber was trying to do here you must stick with the version that defined the show for over 20 years. This is the only version that should be CD no. 1 in your player."
2,Jesus Christ - not quite so super,I was disappointed with this purchase. This is not the original recordings that I was looking for. I have some nostalgia for this particular music and was let down a bit bit that fact. This is what I was looking for;Jesus Christ Superstar - The Original Studio Cast (2012 Digitally Re-Mastered Edition)
5,Extremely Talented Group of Singers,"I heard this version before I ever saw any of the actual shows. I have since seen the musical twice, both times not as good as this version, though there is something to say for seeing the singers in the flesh. In particular the casting of Judas seems to be quite difficult. It is an extremely challenging part, and in the two shows I have seen, Judas tends to scream and croak throughout the high parts. However this Judas is more than capable of hitting all the notes. The bottom line is every time you see this show it will be different, but I personally find this cast to give phenomenal performances on every song."
2,superstar,"didn't realize that the movie soundtrack differed from the Live production version. This isn't bad, but I prefer the singers in the movie version."
2,Disappointing at best,"My initial experience with this marvelous opera was the original vinyl recording. It was excellent throughout. This rendition, which I bought mostly due to pricing, was very disappointing to me. There was a sense of forced performance, an apparent attempt to ""out-do"" the original cast, and too much energy used to become ""creative"" with the original performance and vinyl recording. I agree with one reviewer who lauds the work of Claire Moore (Mary Magdalene), a key figure in the life of Christ, for purity of sound and depth of vocal quality. However, I stop short of saying she is better than the original cast person.In fact, I'm returning this recording without regard for reimbursement in favor of spending a few bucks more for the original CD recording of JCS.Respectfully,Russell F. Mertz"
3,Stay with the original!!!,"Webber's JCS is a 5 star work, but this production version was very disappointing. I purchased this CD hoping to for a digitally recorded (DDD) version of the original. What I received was a distant shadow of the original. This version is much less musical with much more breathy talking or screeching to the music. The whining guitar addition to the overture is extremely irritating, and ruins the beauty of Webber's masterpiece. There are many other changes to the original that are clearly made for the sake of being different, but not better. The parts of Jesus, King Herod, and Judas are very weak seconds to their original brethren. The only high point is the part of Mary. Claire Moore's voice is beautiful."
1,BORING!,"WORST JESUS CHRIST SUPERSTAR CD EVER! THIS IS WORST THAN THE CONCEPT RECORDING! THERE IS NOTHING GOOD ABOUT THIS CD! NOTHING! JESUS CHRIST SUPERSTAR FANS, DON'T BE FOOLED BY THE REALLY COOL TITLE OF THIS CD! IT IS AWFUL! OK, IT HAS ALL THE SONGS, BUT, COME ON!"
4,Worth the purchase,"Touching Home is a wonderful little film with extraordinary performances from Harris, Dourif, and Forrester. Because the twins are identical, it takes a bit of concentration to follow which twin is saying what. I recommend you also pick up the book written by the Millers which chronicles the ups and downs of producing their own film, ""You're either in, or your in the way""."
3,Not bad!,Wanted to see the difference with the classic 80s OHOTMU and was essentially (pun intended) let down.. The bio info contains crappy history facts of each hero.. The art is early 90s horrific marvel art (even contains Liefield-- yikes!)
4,In-Flight Hungarian: Learn Before You Land,It's great! I learned quite a few Hungarian words in just a few days.
4,Helpful,"I wouldn't call this ""in flight"" learning,due to the massive retention needed. It's best to get this early and play it over and over. You will gather what you are looking for and move on.After traveling to Budapest, we found that very little other than Thank you, good morning, good day is needed. It's a courtesy to learn some of the language when traveling, but generally most of the younger generation and the hotels, shops, and tourist attractions have English speakers."
4,Worth every Forint,"I wouldn't wait for the flight, but I listened to these tapes for a couple of months on my commute before going to Hungary and it was very helpful. Some suggestions. It would be more helpful if you begin not just by listening, but by sitting down with the book and getting used to the written word. Then once familiar, listening can be more fruitful. I managed to master a few important phrases like Hello, yes, no, I don't speak Hungarian, do you speak English, excuse me, how much, where is.. and sorry. But if I could do it again, I would have made a more concerted effort to learn my numbers (at least to 5) and as much of the CD as possible. It is only one CD, but it covers a lot of material. I believe that if you memorized everything in the CD, you would do very well. Keep in mind that there is a fair amount of English used in Hungary, it seems to be the common language between all non-English tourists, but it helps to learn a little Magyar, and I wholeheartedly recommend this CD."
5,You have to listen in order to believe,"Mahler is one of my favorite composers, I consider him the best composer of symphonies ever. ""Das Lied von der Erde"" might not be as ""big"" as his other symphonies, yet with the proper vocalists, it can make you shiver in you chair. And this recording surely packs the proper vocalists. There is a perfect balance between the powerful tenor Julius Patzak and the crystal clear voice of Kathleen Ferrier. The Wiener Philharmoniker orchestra under Bruno Walter is working in perfect union with the vocalist. I don't know if this is the ""best"" recording of ""Das Lied von der Erde"", but it surely deserves a place of honor in any music lover's collection. 5 shining stars for this piece."
5,A WONDERFUL INSPIRING READ,This book is an inspiration. It is a must read for everyone. I truly enjoyed every line.
1,Still Shedding,I have not seen any difference in shedding and I have been using for several weeks - My cat does not like the taste of it on his food.
2,A SLAPDASH COLLECTION OF PEOPLE WITH A HOLIDAY TO SELL,"no insight into James JOyce or his writings. A lot of space dedicated to the guy who hosts a yearly reading on BRoadway of very brief excerpts from Ulysses AND OTHER UREALTED WORKS, as broadcast on NPR. I now no longer regret having missed these transmissions. IT is obviously a reluctant reading of snippets from the great work which JOyce urged not a word should be dropped. I already cannot bear hearing the Jim NOrton ABRIDGED recording.If you want insight and commentary into Ulysses, turn to Kenner and the rest. This book is simply an overblown advertisement. Frank McCourt has very little to say. This book is personalities, not perceptions.Two stars for being of Ulysses even obliquely, but it will join the other self-interested Ulysses related works in a bottom drawer rather than the preciously brief space on the much visited top shelf.Ulysses is far TOO IMPORTANT to waste time and space on such commercially self-interested works."
5,Arrau's Somber Chopin Nocturnes,"Available elsewhere as part of a collection of impromptus, Claudio Arrau's distinguished performances of Chopin's Nocturnes and other works sound richer and more vibrant in this remastered set; among the latest in the Philips 50 series. Arrau's performances may not be enjoyable to most, since his playing tends to be quite dramatic, with a darker, more somber vision of Chopin's scores than found elsewhere from the likes of Barenboim and Rubinstein, among others. Still these are remarkable, distinctive performances which should be recognized as among the finest recordings of Chopin's Nocturnes. I doubt I have heard anyone else probe more successfully into the most melancholy aspects of Chopin's personality, done with much elegant, refined playing. Without question this is a splendid two CD set worth owning."
5,Your educated big sister helps you with your divorce,"One of the things I particularly like about Dawn Bradley Berry's work is her equal attention to pragmatic legal detail and human emotion and behavior. This book is fantastic because not only does it provide logistical and strategic procedural guidance to the divorce process, it provides the reader with encouragement and a source of solace.Divorce, even in the best of circumstances, is difficult and unsettling. It is refreshing to see an author provide resources for the wide range of issues that are likely to arise, whether in the court hearing or in the psyche. Berry writes in a clear, compassionate manner, and her readers will come away much enlightened and educated at a time in life when everyone could use a comforting word.Highly recommended."
2,Don't bother.,"Not advised for anybody contemplating divorce unless they buy it cheap and used.There is no excuse for such a physically ugly book...this isn't 1955.Surely there must be a Divorce For Idiots?The Internet is a better resource.Talk to an attorney that claims to ""mediate."""
2,"terrible tape hiss, and Bjoeling is all wrong for the tenor","There is a lot of tape hiss that is very annoying. But even more of a fault is poor Jussi Bjoeling. Once the greatest tenor in the world. He shouts his big aria and the two B's are strain. Price is beautiful, but she is not enough to save the set."
3,Sci fi 1979 style.,"Many genre's suffer from the downgrading of their literature from the height of Top Sellerdom to the racks of Young Adult fiction. Jules Verne, HG Wells, and now the Star Wars and Star Trek novels are falling into this abyss.This and the other Star Wars add-on novels were fine when first printed. But are now the type of books that young adult readers even find boring.Very light reading for the Star Wars fan."
5,good globe,When I opened the box I saw that it was exactly what I needed. I worked out great. Would order another if needed.
4,Need to hem,They were longer than I expected. I had bought in a store and had no problem. Will have to have them hemmed.
4,Great,"I love these jeans! Spent a little more than I normally would on jeans, wondering if it would really make a difference. It certainly did! They fit beautifully, very comfortable. They stretch a little with wearing but not a lot. Wash very well. My favorite pair, I will buy another pair."
5,great slimming jeans!,"these jeans are amazing! not only do they fit like a glove, they smooth you out and make your butt look awesome! i am going to have a hard time wearing any thing else!! i am a true size 18, and i bought the 18. they fit a bit tight at first, but loosen up nicely!"
2,THEY GROW WHEN YOU WEAR THEM,"ORDER A SIZE SMALLER OR TWO, AS THE DAY GOES BY THE PANTS GET SO BIG THEY NEARLY FALL OFF, THEY STREACH TOO MUCH FOR ME. I HAVE PUT THEM IN THE DRYER AND WHEN YOU 1ST PUT THEM ON THE 1ST 5 MINUTES THEY FIT THE REST OF THE HOUR YOU THINK YOU HAVE YOUR MOTHERS JEANS ON, AND MY MOTHER OUT WEIGHTS ME BY 20 LBS, THOSE JEANS STREACH EACH HOUR YOU WEAR THEM, MADE ME FELL SLOPPY IN THEM, I AM FROM TEXAS AND WE WEAR OUR JEANS CLOSE FITTING."
5,Two guitar masters meet in great musical form,"Classical guitar music seems to be an acquired or old-fashioned taste these days. Thanks to a friend, Phil Rosheger, a Segovia master student and composer, I heard this album and heard just how extra-ordinary it is. Two master classical players knocking back some great music I had never heard before. This album is a revelation of many facets of music that were unknown to me before. Music is the pathway to a higher plane. This album is a great example, a great gift."
4,Very excellent CD.,"I have heard this CD before, and ordered it from Amazon.com last Wednesday, Overnight shipping. This is Monday night, and it hasn't even shipped yet. Great CD, but go somewhere to buy it if you want it this century!"
5,compilation of the year,"Smokin' smokin' smokin'! Sean Rowley's TV series of the same name took the train to nerdville more than a few times, but this CD is essential listening. From Love Unlimited Orchestra's widescreen disco heaven to Axelrod's genius closing psych-out, via storming funk, soul, reggae, R&B, you name it, this comp is a blinder from start to finish. Sure, it bedhops genres like the naughty musical tart it is, but that just goes to prove the substance of the old cliche about there being only good and bad music. This is squarely in the former camp. For true music lovers, ""All Back To Mine"" is elevating and educating...:-).Hats off to Sean Rowley for this faultless comp. All back to his I say!"
4,sweet music,All I can say is this CD has one of the best songs ever made on it:Soul at Sunrise by Juggy and I have made it my theme song.
3,"Too Much Information, Not Enough Knowledge","Basically this is a book in which the author, instead of using the tried and true method of using either graphs or tables to coordinate his information, decided to write everything out in long hand. The result is the reader getting his or her head over-stuffed with names, titles, chart figures, sales figures, years, etc. and finishing each chapter and finally the book with the feeling of having eaten too much rather than being nourished."
1,The little steamboat that couldn't,"My boyfriend and I both love shabu shabu, so I was thrilled when he bought me this shabu pot as a gift. The first night we used it, we laid out a feast of sliced beef, lamb and vegetables which congregated around our shiny, brand new shabu pot. Starved and salivating, we turned on the shabu pot, tummies aching in anticipation of the meal to come. The water heated, began steaming, and a few tiny bubbles rose to the surface... but simply never broke into a rolling boil. We tried cooking one of the pieces of meat in the water, but it was clear that the water simply wasn't hot enough, and was never going to get hot enough. We ended up cooking our shabu on the stove. Another glitch is that the hot plate kept turning itself off. There were similar complaints about the 2-in-1 version of this product, so I don't think the problem was specific to the one we bought!"
4,good buy,cant say anything about the effectiveness as this is a simple supplement but it was recommended by my vet and friends so I bought it. My dog loves it and eats it like a treat. she will actually pick it out of her food and eat it alone before going back to her meal. this is different than most vitamins which dogs generally hate. Good buy!!!
2,or 2.2 stars,"kinda boring, long movie; so what that klaus kinski is in it who later did creature in the late 70's. the video quality was great. towards the end it gets better: the crash thru window scene, the flooding ole washing machine & the silly fight: short lived action & not enough action."
1,Tarzan gets trashed,"This rare serial and important addition to the Tarzan canon is totally ruined by the awful treatment giving to it in this DVD set.The picture quality is fair at best with most of it too dark or either too washed out. The sound is so bad that it's almost impossible to understand 90% of the dialogue through the loud sea of hiss.Save your money, this is a total rip-off."
5,great,I had seen this movie when I was around 12 years old and I really wanted to see it again. I wanted to feel the excitement I felt then and believe me it was almost the same. Thank you for still bringing us something to remember.
3,Poor quality but a good Tarzan flick,"I agree that the transfer to DVD could have been better. But the truth is, this is a good Tarzan story. Tarzan is intelligent and acutally dressed in clothing when hanging out with people. He only goes loin cloth when in the Jungle. That is how Burroughs wrote the charater in most of his novels. Also Burroughs hand picked Herman Brix to play Tarzan makes so this movie something closer to what the author had in mind."
2,Roan group version better?,"I bought both the MADACY and ROAN GROUP versions to compare, and couldn't see much difference, in fact the ROAN GROUP version had extras that had no connection, that I could figure out, with Tarzan at all, and billed an item that I couldn't even find on the disc!See my review in the ROAN GROUP dvd site."
2,Flash Gordon Cliff Hangers and Flash Gordon Conquers the Universe are one and the same!,"Swept up in a nostalgia mood, I purchased the two CD set of old Flash Gordon ""Cliff Hangers"" and a single CD entitled ""Flash Gordon Conquers the Universe"". Little did I know that each was the same 12 episode serial that I saw in the movie matinee so many years ago. ""The Purple Death"" is also a title that may be attributed to this particular serial of Flash with Buster Crabbe as Flash. SO, buyers beware, these two titles are the same thing. One just uses two discs and more packaging than the other.The content is just as I remembered from my childhood, but in this day and age, all of those cutting edge 1940 special effects are quite comical. The dressed up lizards are great monsters. I wonder if kids of today would even like these serials. But, I have waited for a long time to see some of these episodes again. I just wish that I didn't have two of the same thing.Oh well.Keep on watching!"
3,Maya Collapse at Copan?,"Webster's book is a good review of the Collapse theories forwarded to explain the demise of the Classic Maya. While Webster covers all of the relevant arguments in the literature, this book does not cover much new ground. Further, his discussion of the Copan data ignores the possibility of a complete Maya depopulation of Copan at the end of the Classic Period suggested by non-Maya Early Postclassic structures reported from the site center."

1,Quality control out to lunch?,"This isn't a complaint against this distributor but it is a complaint against the product. I purchased one of these(from another distributor), put it on my bench grinder, turned it on and immediately turned it back off. The mounting flange to the brush mount must be severely bent as this wheel had a major wobble to it. I tried a couple different mounting configurations and nothing would change the severity of the wobble. This product is unusable."
5,Protection First!,"Up in the Northeast, it is imperative to protect your expensive headlights. With all the sand, gravel, and rocks that strike ones vehicle during the winter and otherwise--you would be a fool not to cover them up. I have them in clear for the winter, and shaded for the summer. Look great, fit perfectly!"
5,Dr Susan Love's Menopause and Hormone Book,Dr. Susan Love's Menopause and Hormone Book: Making Informed Choices
5,Great info for newly menopausal women!,This was the perfect book for me when hot flashes started making my life a living hell!!! I felt miserable and had extreme insomnia - well Dr. Loves book covers all options - natural vs HRT and what is best for you. There is even a test to help you decide the best choices based on your family history and lifestyle. Her book shows the results of all the clinical trials which is great information. Happy to say - 3 months after making my own choices from Dr. Love's book I am sleeping all night and have no more hot flashes with progesteren cream and herbal supplements!!! Thank you Susan Love!!!!
3,Dr Susan Loves Menopause and Hormone Book,The book was in good condition but after I started reading it the pages pulled away from the binding.
1,Bing and Basie....definitely past their prime,"It really is hard for me to have to give an album by Bing (or Count Basie for that matter) a one star rating. However, this album is really awful. Both artists are well past their prime. Add to that an awful song selection of late 60's tunes (akin to the selection on ""Hey Jude, Hey Bing""), and you have a real mess. ""Little Green Apples"", which Bing also sang for ""Hey Jude, Hey Bing"", is particularly terrible.Track listing:1.""Gentle On My Mind""2.""Everything Is Beautiful""3.""Gonna Build a Mountain""4.""Sunrise, Sunset""5.""Hangin' Loose""6.""All His Children""7.""Put Your Hand In the Hand""8.""Snowbird""9.""Little Green Apples""10.""Sugar, Don't You Know""11.""Have a Nice Day""I love both guys, and have a plethora of Bing CD's in my collection, dating back to his earliest recordings. However, this is really a painful listen, both artistically, and emotionally....as it is sad that both of them reached this point. This one went to the used CD shop."
5,Neil Diamond At His Dynamic Best In 1976 Live In Concert,"This VHS is a wonderful treat. This is a truly great live concert video. You will never see Neil Diamond sing like this again as he did in 1976 at his prime. In this landmark performance the songs are true to their original melodies and so exciting. The program runs for a wonderful 52 minutes. The music is timeless. The songs include:Cherry CherrySweet Caroline - such a sweet melody gives me chillsPlay Me - another great melodyBeautiful Noise - a nice beatStreet LifeLady OhIf You Know What I Mean - full of emotionSong Sung Blue - fun with the audience & Helen Reddy(terrific)Cracklin' Rosie - the audience can't sit down, so much beatHolly HolyI Am...I SaidBrother Love's TravelingSalvation ShowI've Been This Way BeforeLive Concert (Memorial 335/5)"
3,Very good but......................,"I grew up listening to Neil Diamond. I used to have the Double LP of this concert. To be honest, I was a little disapointed with this viedo. It isn't because of the performence, Neil diamond himself is always great. It's cool seeing him in a concert that was filmed nack when I was 12 years old.I would have given this a 4 star rating if at least it included the fifteen minute medley ""Johnathan livingston seagull"" that is on the CD.I expect more than this. It should have included the whole concert instead of the edited for TV version. The fault lies with those who edited the viedo-not with Neil diamond. He himself gets 5 stars-but the video gets 3 stars."
5,Watch and Be Mesmerized!,"Being a New York City girl, I have grown up with Neil Diamond's music in my subconscious. His music was always on the radio ever and I have literally been a fan from the time I came to understand the meaning and intent of words themselves. But this is the first Neil Diamond recording I have ever purchased. It was delightful. I enjoyed his playfulness with the audience and how he masterfully delivered his talents. I especially enjoyed ""I am...I Said"". Watch how his eyes sparkle as he sings and listen to how beautiful his voice is. This is is a real treat for any fan. I hope that it becomes available on DVD and that other clips from this magnificent series of concerts are included. Wishing on a star."
4,Overall satisfied,I like the design. I tested the oven with Pillsbury rolls.It took about twice the amount of time to bake but does not burn in the bottom at all. Tried it again with P. rolls and it helps to turn the temperature up more and preheat. I added a little more time than recommended by the rolls.
2,OK but disappointing,"The toaster oven works OK, but the oven takes forever to heat up, diminishing energy saving benefits. My partner calls it the SUV of toaster ovens -- it is really huge. Next time, I would get the convection oven version."
2,Does a decent job... til it stops working,"I used this about twice a week for about a year now. Mainly toast and waffles but occasionally to cook a roast or pork tenderloin, generally with rolls in the top compartment. Did an all right job, probably deserved three stars until it just stopped working. Didn't cook faster than my normal electric oven but I figured I was saving power so I'd use it when I could. One thing to watch out for is the slide out grate. Pull it out two inches... safe.... any more and it starts to lean downward quickly and your broiling hot food slides along with the grate on out the oven. Cleaning was easy.Overall, an item at this price needs to last much much longer and it really doesn't cook quicker than a normal oven."
3,Grandma,"This item is a good product. Takes up more space than I thought it would. The back of the oven gets really hot, so pull away from the wall. Works well for what it is intended. Easy to use."
3,T-Fal Avanti Elite - Promising but Disappointing,"We have owned this toaster oven for 3 years, and it is a mixed review. We have enjoyed its size, both for toasting and for baking. Has been nice for small casseroles, hors d'ouvres and summer alternative to oven. It is slow to warm up, slow to toast, and slow to bake if you do not adjust the temp. We have found that the temperature for the oven is 50 to 75 degrees off. We routinely set the oven that much higher to get the right temp for baking. My biggest complaint is that the control buttons have not been durable. The Temp button got permenantly stuck within the first year. It was fixed under warranty. Now, the Toast button is malfunctioning. It will soon be unusable, and we will need to fix or replace the toaster oven. A toaster oven should last longer than three years, and this one is not inexpensive."
2,UGLY and BIG,"This toaster oven toasts and cooks OK, but it is HUGE. The warmer on top is unnecessary space, and gives it a dopey look. I have to live with it for now, but look forward to the day it breaks (""Oops! I didn't mean to drop that brick on it"")"
5,Great service!,Product was in great condition. I received the package in a timely manner...even during the holiday season. Thank you so much!
5,My son loves it,Too much functions. Still working on it. However the temperature I don't know if it's hand or environment. Will recommend to freinds.
1,Not worth the $30,"The watch isn't worth it. The wristband broke at the hinge that connects the band to the watch. So, I can't buy new bands for it. It also has way too many functions than are necessary for me. I took this to the beach and initially found myself using the tide function a lot, but after a while I didn't use it. The moon function is also not necessary. And the thermometer isn't accurate when it's on your wrist.The worst design flaw was that the light doesn't stay on for more than about 1 second. So, at night, if you try to set the alarm or view other functions you have a lot of trouble. I wound up having to push the light, then push the mode button twice, then push the light, then push the mode button, then push the light, then get into setting the alarm (but still not set), then push the light, then change the alarm hour, then push the light, then continue changing the alarm hour, etc. You get the point. So, now I almost never use the watch, so it was a waste of my money."
4,Frakking cool!,"This watch is great, is basic as others but the thermometer and the tide graph are great, the only problem is that the thermometer is not so accurate because the body heat affects it around 3-4C but when you don't use it, the accuracy is good. The tide graph and the moon phase depends of the coordinates of your position, so you have to use google earth or a GPS for solving that problem. I like the watch. XD"
4,Worth its price,"Pros:1. Many functions like world time, temp, tide, moon phase2. Backlight3. So far no malfunction in time keeping or any other function (I purchased it 2 months ago)4. The analog and digital clocks can be set independently.Cons:1. The analog clock hands has some fluoroscent paint, but it fluorosces for very short time in dark. So one has to see the time using backlight, which consumes lot of battery power.2. I synchronized the digital clock with EST one month back but now there is a 10 sec difference!"
4,Nice gift for a sports person,I brought this watch as my husband's Birthday present. He loved it very much nice watch with good features.but hard to useto with instructions.
4,Very solid watch,"I like it a great deal, good price, and I've found the thermometer to be useful (I surf, and use it to measure the water temp - it's useless for air temp if you're wearing it, as others have mentioned.Users manual is cryptic even by cheap watch standards, though, so if you want to set the moon/tide functions, do some googling on terms like ""lunitidal"" if you want help"
2,Present,I was very dissappointed. Bought as a present for an older relative. Letters/numbers too small--programming too difficult.
3,"Nice, but...","I bought this watch because it was a Casio, and because it was reasonably priced. I did get those two things. I liked it had the thermometer, but that does not seem to be any where near accurate. The watch is slim, which is nice, but the wrist strap holder does not seem to keep the strap in place. Lastly, I thought the combo of Digital and Analog would be cool, but instead they just compete against each other for visibility."
1,Body temp,"No matter what I do to set temp. It still reads body temp. Not surrounding temp. I might be doing something wrong, but have spent some time setting it time and time again. To me it doesn't do what it say it does."
2,disapointed - leaked right away,"I searched hard for a not -too-expensive watch with tides that I need for surfing and boating. this seemed too good to be true compared with what was out there. $30 for like 7 intstruments including tide and temp, waterproof etc.First problem (for me) was how difficult this watch is to read - very,very small readouts on things like date, moon, tide, etc. The analog hands are white on a background of light grey (who's idea was that?) I got over that. Next problem was that the tide did not callibrate with my actual tides - I got passed that by tweaking one of the settings a couple of hours and that works fine.Big Problem - surfed with it twice, nothing too extreme, and there's now water under the crystal. I probably just got a bad one but am too busy to deal with the ins and outs of returning.Back to the drawing boardFollow up report: Unbeleivably the watch is still running fine a week later (with the water inside) i'm just using it now till it dies"
3,Decent watch but not great.,The set up for this watch is a little confusing. The temp is the hardest. The watch is nice looking but the digital readout is sometimes obscured by the hands. I also wish illumination lasted a bit longer.
3,OK but could be better.,"Not a horrible watch for the price but I'll echo some previous complaints, mainly that the crystal is very scratch-prone. Mine had white scuffs on it the whole time I wore it. Sadly, that wasn't too long because, just with normal use, the band broke in slightly less than a year. This watch is no G-shock. I'd bought it as a G-shock alternative but went straight back after this experience. Also, the buttons/functions are a little counter intuitive compared to a G. But overall a fairly flimsy and insubstantial little watch."
2,Very difficult to read,"I bought this for my 30 yr old husband and it was very difficult to read. We returned it. Side note, the white part around the face is not as strong as the picture makes it look. Which I thought was a bonus."
2,'Watch' out,"Although this watch does have the thermometer as one of its functions, it is rather useles for ambient condition monitoring. Readings change only every 5 minutes and even then, I've found that generally you have to go through 3 reading cycles for it to be even close to what otrher thermometers are reading. If you are trying to measure ambient temperatures, don't be wearing it. It is very complicated and you'd best be carrying the manual with you all the time. Moving through the various functions and/or changing settings is awful. I very much regret buying it."
4,"Excellent watch, but a bit complicated","I love this watch, the appearance and operation are excellent for the price. The only thing I do not like it the complicated settings. It comes with a manual that looks like a Man vs Wild Survival guide. I would not buy this for someone not too electronic savvy. But for the money, it is worth spending time reading the manual."
5,also a good timekeeper,"had watch for almost 2 yrs now..kept perfect time and also temp..till i learned how to use other feature,,now i know when a full moon and high tides are..pretty cool"
2,Temperature Sensing watch,The Casio watch with built-in thermometer does not live up to expectations. The watch will only sense body and ambient temperature while watch is worn. The digital display is small and the clock hands often hide the numbers when trying to read the date or time.
3,Not as described. Very complex to use/configure,"I was hoping for the black rubber band, but I got an all metal band. The manual was about 1700 pages long and setting this puppy up was not exactly intuitive. I threw in the towel and returned it. At least it wasn't that expensive."
3,Nice watch but poor bezel design,I love this watch but it has one major flaw. The bezel is not protected by the case at all. It actually is a dome shape instead of being set into the case like most sport type watches. I got 2 big scratches in it within 2 weeks. As above....the temp does not read correctly unless you take the watch off but I expected that.
5,Bang for the buck,"This watch serves all of the purposes and is nice and large without being heavy. I like everything about it. Temp seems to be relatively accurate after setting it to me (within 2 degrees at any given time). I like the luminescent hands and backlight. Still haven't figured out what the appearing and disappearing blocks around the outside do? They move in time with seconds, but don't count seconds (10 seconds are not counted from 25 to 35?). Only complaints are I wish the backlight worked for as long as I hold the light button instead of afterglow (but I'm sure others prefer this feature, so not too big of grievance), and I would like to see an inset crystal on future models (lots of room for damage as is), also a true rubber band instead of resin would be nice (I'm sure this would drive up the price though). Overall, extremely pleased. Shipping was fast and watch showed up in perfect condition."
5,Great Watch For The Money,I have had this watch for about 3 weeks.Keeps great time.And the Thermometer works great.I have had a lot of comment on it.LOOKS GREAT.I rate it a 10 on a scale
4,Good Everyday Watch,This is a good Everyday watch takes a beating pretty well.. My only complaint is the setup of the watch itself. The temperature function is kinda useless cause it picks up your body heat.But hey it was a $30 watch.
5,Useful watch (band only lasts about a year though) only 3 stars,"I found this watch to be quite useful. Setting the watch does take some effort, but the instruction guide does help explain it fairly well. The thermometer needed a little calibration to work well on my arm. It does take a few minutes to adjust to a temperature change. A nice feature is that the analog watch hands have a light all the time so you can see the time even if it is very dark.Revised: July 9, 2009:The watch continues to work well, though the plastic band is falling apart and is not replaceable. I would rate the watch as 3 stars at this point."
4,Casio Forester Watch,"nice watch but it took a while to get everything setup due to getting in the right ""mode"". But I like the watch - I think it would look better with a cloth band instead of the plastic one it comes with."
3,Still a Casio,"I bought this watch to replace a Casio I had misplaced. I am working in Iraq as a contractor and I hear how hot is it all the time. This watch seemed to have it all in one . The thermometer is not accurate at all,not even close. Other than that it is a Casio and dependable."
4,casio forester thermo sports watch,Watch arrived promptly[6 days to regional Australia].Works great .Instruction booklet printing needs to be larger.
1,Not so Hot,"I really liked the First Aids for USMLE 1 and USMLE 2 and found this book a much weaker cousin and very expensive for the content. There's nothing here that you can't get from JAMA or your Dean's office. The Iserson's Getting Into a Residency gives you a lot more info for about the same price. There's almost nothing to help out the IMG (who I suspect are frequent buyers) and (again) nothing for anyone with special circumstances, such as older age, second careers, disability, couples match, gay and lesbian issues, etc. Borrow a copy from the library instead."
1,Disappointing,"Conceptually interesting, but poorly executed. The video scenes are amateurish and poorly aligned with the musical selections. You're just as well off spinning your favorite CD while watching the video feed from the Travel channel on cable. Better, perhaps."
4,"Still, no apologies from Roth--and that's a good thing.","I view this novella as a breath between the major works Roth has been producing routinely for the past several years, and a welcome one at that. Is Kepesh reprehensible? Of course he is, and that's precisely the point. And whether you view the book as misogynistic is BESIDES the point, like it or not. Any capable reader would be wise not to equate Kepesh's character with Roth--even if resemblances to ""real life"" may occur here and there. Roth could easily become more ""politically correct"" to woo and coax the Noble Prize bigwigs, but he doesn't, and that to me strengthens his reputation as a writer. And for the person who made the mistake of identifying Roth as the author of the BENNY PODA YEARS: how could you possibly mistake this as a work of Roth's? Please!"
4,"Gave plenty, but finished wanting more.","A tough read. Kepesh is a likable figure, but one that gets lost in his own mind. This book is reminiscent of Banville's, ""The Sea"" in that finished it but felt like I immediately needed to re-start in order to understand what I just went through.All-in-all, a quick, good read. Another brilliant description by Roth of what makes humans tick. If you ever find yourself re-evaluating choices in life, read this to make you feel better."
3,Lesser Roth,"I have come to enjoy Roth rather late. I read him in high school and college, but it never quite clicked with me. As sex obsessed as Updike, but perhaps not as illuminating of conditions I could relate to. But his smaller scale recent work is very appealing to me. Everyman, Nemesis, Indignation, Exit Ghost. Good strong stuff and so beautifully written. I just read this short novel and although I know it is not as simple as that, it does make one wonder if the intense focus on sex leaves other human needs behind just a tad too much? There were good moments, and Roth is so skilled with language and thought processes that I was never inclined to put the book away, but still it was only sporadically engaging. Try the books that follow instead."
2,huh?,"think rambling, jekyllian Hemingway. IN and OUT, UP and DOWN, but going nowhere. Mercifully short though, I must say. Should have been a magazine article. The cover eludes to some erotic undertone, but I couldn't find it. ""Memoirs of a whiny old man"" should have been the title..."
2,Nothing like the best Roth and here's a tip,"When you love a book, as I did ""Portnoy's Complaint"" and ""The Ghost Writer"" even more than Roth's later books, though I felt keenly attuned to ""The Counterlife"" too, you Remember the scenes vividly even if, as I am, you are aging and tend to be forgetful. Now, I read ""The Dying Animal"" only two months ago, not 25+ years ago, and I remember breasts, the cancer, the man's consciousness, but vaguely as lesser books are forgettable or become vague. Just writing this helps me clarify how to tell if you love a book and if you find it worthy: how much and how well can you conjure back, vividly. Here, not much. But with Roth, one has a large selection from which to choose. I'm a Rothophile, and do not expect genius each time out."
3,fascinating study,"At first glance, this appeared to me a misogynistic and annoying novella, but as it progressed, I found myself caught up in what became an intelligent and wonderfully insightful work about sexuality and aging and much more in between. Yes, it's a little full of itself, but then again, this is Philip Roth. Very satisfying, if unnerving at points."
4,fascinating in many ways,"i read an advance copy of this over the weekend...roth is certainly on a mission. he publishes every year now (thankfully), and continues to explore not how to get on Oprah's list, but how to illuminate the male psyche. Sex, death, all the usual new york jewish intellectual obsessions, but explored not for comedy but for true understanding. there's a scene here involving sex and menstral blood that perfectly encompasses all of roth's themes and obsessions. A short (but actually a perfect length for this story) work, but as captivating and fascinating as any of his longer books."
2,Not a Fan,"Roth writes well and the book keeps your interest throughout. But I felt the ride wasn't worth it in the end. His story of a man being undone emotionally by a younger woman certainly isn't the best novel on the topic. Personally, I couldn't seem to build sufficient empathy for the main character. Loved the short format though."
1,One Wishes Much More from Mr. Roth,"I felt the novel to be boring, a simple rehash of Mr. Roth's earlier work, and sloppily written at that. This is too bad, for Roth, at his best, is nothing less than a genius: his novella THE BENNY PODA YEARS was, for me, his finest work since SHYLOCK. But the present novel fails to achieve Roth's previous level of innovation."
3,"a curiosity, but mediocre",Michael Bolton as a rocker. I can't believe I bought this and listened to it. It is pretty much exactly what you would expect.
5,Authenticity Versus Arrangements,"I have heard and played several different arrangements of Handel's Water Music and Royal Fireworks, but none do justice to the original music. John Elliot Gardiner is known for his authentic interpretations of baroque music because he uses period instruments. What makes this version stand out is the exquisite phrasing and dynamic constrast used in the different musical phrases. The music demands the listener's attention because of the fine way the dynamic contrasts are brought out in the music. This professional presentation encourages the listener's engagement of the music through the way the melodies and harmonies intermingle."
3,the best Water Music available,"This recording, featuring John Eliot Gardiner conducting the English Baroque Soloists, is in my opinion, the best available version of Handel's Water Music. Though I greatly admire the stately grandeur of Marriner's version with The Academy of St Martin-in-the-Fields (also available on Amazon: ASIN: B0000040Y4), I find Gardiner's rollicking, improvising vision more compelling by far.There is life in the music of this recording. The playing is precise without being sterile. The pieces move and breathe and surprise. Gardiner's chosen order of the Suites makes a great deal of sense. The finale in particular is a thing of true emotional resonance.Philips' new repackaging (For their ""50"" series) with Gardiner's earlier recording of Handel's Music for the Royal Fireworks adds a lot more value for less money than either recording once cost on its own. This is a real bargain.At this ridiculously low price, I give this excellent recording a wholehearted recommendation."
1,"Please read ""LOU's ON FIRST"" instead","I just finished reading the wonderful book; ""Lou's On First"" about Lou Costello and written by his youngest daughter Chris Costello and it mentions this ""made-for-TV movie"" and where it comes from. Don't waste your money on this piece of trash! I'm originally from Paterson, NJ and have always been proud of Lou coming from my home town."
1,Worst Representation Ever !!!,"As an A&C ultimate fan I can't believe they made such a horrible movie. It had so many holes in it. The acting was terrible as the classic ""Who's On First"" was made UNFUNNY by Korman and Hackett who will never be confused with Abbott and Costello. I'm forced to give it one star because you can't go any lower."
3,good detailed look at the greatest comedy duo ever.,I saw this movie and now I know what it must have been like to be going into movies when movies were new. It was a wonderful look at the begining of this comedy team their ups and downs. If you like classic comedy don't miss this biography.
5,AN ABBOTT AND COSTELLO MOVIE THAT WON'T MAKE YOU LAUGH.,"Based on the book ""BUD AND LOU:THE ABBOTT AND COSTELLO STORY"" by Bob Thomas, and directed by Robert C. Thompson this comedy/drama follows Abbott and Costello (Harvey Korman, Buddy Hackett) from their modest start in vaudeville through their early radio success and, utlimately, to their stardom as motion picture and televison stars."
5,the last one...,"In a way, it's too bad that this *is* the last book of the series. (Since this happens to be one of my favourite mangas.) On the other hand, it's nice to see Godai finally expressing his true feelings towards Kozue... And much later on, towards Kyoko as well. My all-time favourite romantic line is in there as well, the one in which Godai tries to explain what his lady love is like. To paraphrase it: ""She's jealous, icy, etc., etc. ... But when she laughs, the world is his."" Especially touching, also, is the request Kyoko makes of Godai after he proposes. Of course he can't grant that, but it's so like Kyoko to ask. This volume is a satisfying conclusion of the series, and I'm glad it ends the way it does. And 'Haruka' is a nice name, isn't it?"
4,The Sequel To The Infamous 'Blood Cult'!,"Once again the video market is blessed with another direct-to-video movie! The sequel to Blood Cult has the evil cult leader (Played by Carradine) continuing his evil blood cult until no one is safe! When a women stubles over the ""secret"" cult she finds out that she is the next to be sacrificed! Teriffic movie!"
2,mmm...not so much.,"I love Susan Mallery, but I really struggled with this story. I really didn't like the cheap meaningless sex at the beginning of the story. It made Darcy seem foolish without much self- respect. Even after she realized the stupidity of sleeping with someone she barely knew with no commitment whatsoever, she would slip into the same mistake over and over again. It made her seem cheap and easy and not a heroine I could respect or identify with.Also, there is some sort of money laundering mystery on the side that never really develops and seems out of place. The story ends and that mystery is left unresolved.This is by far not susan's best work, but she is still one of my favorite authors!"
1,Went in the trash after 2nd use,"Save your money and pass on this product. The device keeps you from closing your BBQ cover. That's to be expected, but I did not expect the corn to fall out of the sides when turning the thing over or carrying it to the table. Although it is adjustable, even at it's tightest setting the corn falls out."
3,not as good as it could be!,Missing a lot a stuff.When I was growing up if you bought a Motor ManualIt had details and procedure as to how to get the job done.They don't bother to make them the way they used to anymore.It's really a Shame!
2,Wasted money,"This book doesn't have a lot of info, it gives you an idea of what needs to be done, but not the details. The electrical diagrams are small, poor quality, and only mostly accurate. I would not buy this book again, and plan on buying something else to replace it."
5,I only can only hope there will be a sequel !,"Useem distills lessons for the reader from the 9 events described in his book. Some of his example case studies have heroic elements to them, yet he focuses on the basis of the decision making process of the principal - rather than only the net effect. Thus, providing the reader with tangible leadership tools to help steer any group, team or organization to their goals.A good read for any manager, coach or leader."
4,Leaders in action,"Useem's description and depiction of each character deviates from the mundane monologue usually produced in hardcore texts. He presents a diverse set of leaders with unique circumstances. Each case is a dramatic narrative. At the same time, Useem provides readers with the underlying details that occurred prior, during and in the aftermath of the major leadership decisions. This is one of a few accounts that examines leadership of men, women, minorities and international leaders in both corporate and non-corporate organizations."
4,"A ""Must Read"" When Faced with Challenge","The Leadership Moment offers insights to some of the great leadership challenges faced by these individuals. The author's use of ""by implication"" statements throughout the summaries help leaders today translate these stories into useful working theories. The ""Leader's Guide"" at the end of the book is an especially helpful reference/reminder tool."
5,hard to find,"i tell ya, if you really want a good sandwich like a real pastrami or corned beef on rye, it just doesn't taste right without gulden's.i had a hard time finding it and went to amazon.com, with success. those of us who a gazillion years ago came from back east, never forget gulden's mustard."
4,Babies Love Polka Music!,I bought this for my baby grandson and I to engage in some lively clapping and dancing. We added in some of his musical instrument toys and had quite the Jam Session. Good way to begin introducing rhythms and beats while have a grand old time.
5,The Real View,"Not a complete biography, but an approach that may well be better for most general readers. The book covers a series of specific topics of continuing interest pertinent to the life of the first of the Founding Fathers. Professor Henriques does splendid work in describing such important facets of George Washington's life as his relationship with Jefferson; his approach to religion; and, how he handled the topic of slavery.Written in a conversational style from lectures (in the best and highest sense of that word) previously given by the author. I think it will inspire many to read further and in greater depth on this, the most important and complete person in U.S. history."
3,Still taught me something new,"If you have already read a couple books about George Washington, you'll find this one a re-hash of many of the things you already know about him.If you think you know a lot about him, you'll still learn a few things. There is a chapter about his attitude toward slavery and how he handled his own slaves as well as a chapter about the details of the pain and suffering of his death."
5,Pizza Pan,"8 minutes in a 600 degree oven and your pizza (fresh, not frozen) is bubbling and crispy on the bottom. It cooks evenly and, as long as you oil the pan a little, and don't pound your raw dough into the air holes, is very non-stick. Recommended for fresh or frozen."
1,UNDER THE INFLUENCE,I BOUGHT THIS CD BEFORE READING ANY REVIEWS. BIG MISTAKE.THIS IS A COMPILATION OF HIS FAVORITE SONGS BY THE ORIGINAL ARTISTS. NO SINGING BY PAUL AT ALL.ALSO WATCH OUT FOR THE PAUL WELLER CD.SAME STORY.BUY UNCUT MAGAZINE INSTEAD.
3,A boring movie ...,"When I bought The Only Way, I thought it was going to be a powerful movie like Miracle at Midnight. The actors are excellent but this movie is kind of boring and not what I was expecting. I strongly recommend Miracle at Midnight as the best movie showing how the Danish people risked their lives in helping the Jews to escape to Sweden."
4,The Brave,"I liked this Film, but it ended too soon. In fact I was astounded at the Final end.Would have liked to have had a story of what happened to these people who escaped? What happened to the people who helped them to undertake this amazing journey. Truly an amazing true story. God Bless them."
3,Not long,I have seen better.Not as good as most war 2 movies.The acting was good but not the story line .
3,The Only Way,"The DVD wasn't quite what I expected, but was enjoyable non the less. An easy watch and happy to have it in my collection."
3,A Must For Jane Seymour's Fans!,"This is really a good performance by the very young Jane Seymour, even when the movie is not very long. But it is worth to be seen."
3,Average,"This CD is only average as a whole. It's selection of music includes most of the great traditionally American anthems and songs, but totally ignores others. The music was mostly too loud to my ears also, and I did not like the modernist renditions of some of them. ""America The Beautiful"" in particular was far too heavy handed and operatic to be enjoyable. Also, just so you know -- there are a total of 18 songs on this CD; I don't know why Amazon only lists 5."
5,Life From Within:Icons from the Church of the Reconciliation in Taize,This little book contains profound and encouraging prayers. They are so honest and simple. They go directly to the heart.
4,"Cute, Necessary Book","I was amazed to learn that most kids have an image of GOD by the age of five, whether or not they're taught spirituality/religion by their parents. That being said, a book like this is a great way to 'jumpstart' spirituality in your child's life. It also teaches tolerance of others, being that the book shows people of different backgrounds.Overall, this book wasn't overly dramatic at all and the illustrations were rather pretty."
5,great for meditation..giving or receiving reiki..attunements,I love this cd... sort of out of this world sound...whether you play this CD for reiki or attunements or just to meditate and destress.. I think you'l love the music.....so will your clients...I have rec'd many compliments on the music ..so...just pop it in your player and enjoy..
4,Another 1980s Must Have,What a great way to spend time with your wife before bed. This was a 1980s classic we both grew up on and enjoy watching it and reminiscing about our youth. If you are a big Ricardo Montalban fan then this is the show to get.
1,very short video,"This dvd is only 12 minutes long! The exercises and the video quality are okay. The price is low, but I wouldn't have purchased this if I knew how short it really was."
2,Not worth buying,"Sorry, but sometinmes Amazon suggests other items you might enjoy based on your buying history. I tried this, and after several tries, gave it up after 50 pages. Time is worth more than the effort to me.What's wrong? Stereotypical characters (some offensively so); sorry attempts to use a ""post-modern"" dialect (corny and off-putting).Only reason it didn't get an awful is that there is a semblence of creativity here; but that only goes to show that one can be quite creative and still produce a rather poor product."
4,Great John Wayne B's!!!,"This DVD ""Winds of the Wasteland"" and ""Lucky Texan"" offers two great early John Wayne westerns. Basically, if you enjoy the old 1930's B westerns you should purchase this DVD. I am buying all of the B movies I can find so I can be certain I'll have them preserved on DVD for my grandchildren to enjoy."
2,Bad Writing/Acting Make Subject Irrelevent,Amateur hour. Can't believe De Palma made this. Just because you don't get big name actors dosen't mean they have to be terrible.
2,"Could have been better, but way too biased","In the right hands, with the right script, actors, etc, this could have been a powerful, devastating movie. Instead, we get an obvious antiwar movie. I don't care that he is against the war, that's his right and none of my business. But politics do not belong in a movie like this. I can see why people took offense. If he stayed neutral, focused on the criminals who did this despicable act and not use the media as a message, then it would have being a lot better. A particularly egregious example is the ending montage. I noticed that in one shot, De Palma actually used an image from his movie. An image from a fictional event in his movie. That one shot put doubt in my mind that Americans actually were responsible for all those casualties."
2,Disappointing film,"I was looking forward to watching this film having seen everything that's been done on the Iraq war and being a De Palma movie fan. But this film was a 'stinker'. 90% of the movie is watching home video of the characters who with all due respect for serving their country, are mostly racist,ignorant and sadistic. The worst criticism I can state about the film is that for the most part it's just boring. The 'message' of the film, that war is insane and it makes those who have to fight it insane is clear enough and even honorable. But watching that message thru one dimensional characters showing what idiots they are, while recorded by the soldier who aspires to go to film school when the war ends, is just not entertaining.The violence and sheer boredom presented are all done okay but the story just 'lays there' and no character grabbed me or created any rooting interest. I would not recommend this film to anyone."
2,Fictional documentary on war in Iraq,"Brian DePalma's presentation on war on Iraq. The idea was to make the film from a soldier's point of view and it involves real life incident of group of an American soldiers who rape 15 year old Iraqi girl, kill her and her family and set them on fire to cover the evidence. Film is made from both party's point of view on the war, perpetual extension of duty for the soldiers who serve there and risk their lives every day and difficulty of ordinary Iraqis to live their lives under such circumstances. For Iraqi's even crossing security checkpoints guarded by American soldiers can be deadly in cases of emergency when they need medical help for woman giving birth. Director is not justifying either party, but he plainly tries to make a point that war is bad and it is mostly the civilians that pay the highest price. While I can hail this movie for its attempt of promoting pacifism, I found it to drag at times primarily because the actors in it were very bad."
4,The Most Tragic Casualty of This War...,"The misapprehension with the majority of these posts is De Palma is committing 'treason' with the release of Redacted. In reality, De Palma forces oxygens back into the lungs of the most tragic of all American casualties thus far, the truth. He is an American hero, and a paradigm for the patriotism of humankind. He humanizes the oppressor and the oppressed, and is cultivating priceless awareness and education to those smart enough to digest it. If you can't watch this movie and learn something, than you should donate your eyes and ears to someone who will."
5,Must see movie for all real Americans,"I actually saw this movie, something many of the other posters have not done. After seeing this it reaffirms that water-boarding is torture and that this country is on the wrong course.""Dissent is the highest form of patriotism.""-Howard Zinn""A patriot must always be ready to defend his country against his government.""- Edward Abbey"
1,Should be illegal.,"This is why so many people are against the Iraq War. One soldier messes up and makes our whole military look bad, and on top of that some guy makes a destructive film about it all. It's already bad enough that the media picks and chooses what they tell people and 90% time it is the negatives. The media hasn't even bothered telling the public about how The An'bar Province once the MOST dangerous area in Iraq is now one of the safest. The people in this area now even have the courage to stand against Al'qaeda and their supporters. But has the media told anyone this? Nope.It's ridiculous. It hurts our troops and puts our military in distress.For every one failure there are 50+ successful missions. For every killed American there are 1000's of dead insurgents. But the media and film makers don't want to tell these stories."
2,how do you vote,"if you on the left, you will like this movie,, and if your on the right,, you will hate this movie.. plain and simple..."
1,$26000 for the opening weekend should tell you something,"This movie is so bad is almost funny. The acting is so amateur it reminds me of a bad lifetime made for tv movie at best. But on the other hand it was a good thing they hired really cheap actors because with only $26000 dollars made on the opening weekend around the country, they'll be glad they cut costs ( and they did, it really shows ) on every turn ( including the writers it seems )"
1,This Movie Bites!,"As a big fan of independent films (which this is) I was all looking forward to this film.. it looked rather dark noir-ish and that's a genre I enjoy, when done well. As it turns out, however, this is the most dull and senseless movie I've seen in quite a while. There is no real mystery, per se. And the acting is atrocious. In a nutshell, the plot is basically this.. a woman sees her husband cheating on her and so calls a Detective. The P.I. falls in love with her because she's so ""naive"" and ""beautiful."" He finds out, eventually, that it's true that her husband cheated on her. He tells her, she moves in with him. They eat Mexican food together but don't do much talking. (her only line for almost 20 minutes is ""I don't want to talk."" She says it over and over again.) Eventually, she leaves the Detective and gets back together with her husband. We don't know why. We don't care why.This is not a plot. This is a rough draft sketch of a plot. And this movie is a big bummer."
5,Wow! Powerful!,"I chose this book because it looked interesting enough on the outside. Little did I know that it would contain a powerful message that would change my way of thinking. This author really writes in a straightforward stye that is refreshing and inspiring and the text seemed to soak into the rather tough skin surrounding my heart. Although I don't read a great deal of inspirational titles, I do encourage everyone to invest in this little book. It's that powerful, It could very well change your life, and brighten your entire outlook on the human experience."
5,Beautiful,I ordered this poster for a gift for my Mother. She hasn't yet seen it but when I opened the parcel and unravelled it I was shocked to see it in such mint condition. I know my mother will love it. I then ordered another poster from this seller for myself :)
5,Showing The Whole Settings (Episode 5-8),"The second volume of DVD version of Hikeaki Anno's first director work develops into the encounter of hypercivilized villain Neo Atlantis asserting themselves that they are descendants of long-forgotten Atlantis Civilization which thrived more than 12,000 years ago. And their evil ambition to redominate the whole universe growing unlimited. Now then the huge crossover with THE CASLE IN THE SKY is much more apparant.The villain's mask reminds me of Kamen(Masked) Rider villain shockers and the way failed general got executed...Hideaki Anno himself seems to revel in it. New character four-year-old Marie gives the viewer respite also the nice pair for Lion baby KING.Verdict: Amusing preview of what is to comeRating: 93 out of 100 Full of excitementRecommended for: Wide range of Japanese anime fans and appreciators of both Anno and Miyazaki works."
4,The Sad Defeat of Polytheism,"God Against the Gods is a take on the long battle between polytheism and monotheism beginning with Akhenaton in ancient Egypt as he forcibly created the worship of one god and ending with the century that contained Constantine and Julian the Apostate, who comes out as one of the heroes of the book in this vivid and easy to read telling. The author, Jonathan Kirsch, posits an interesting theory as he explains that polytheism was generally based strongly on tolerance but it fell continously under the more intolerant weight of monotheism as described in these chapters. The author makes a clear and compelling case. The book is a little too breezy at times and could have used a little more heft in the arguments but it is still a good read for anyone interested in learning the history of religion from a different viewpoint. It is way past time the pagans were heard from in history instead of simply talked about. They have much to say and it is often quite valuable."
4,Essential Reading!!,"For anyone even half interested in understanding the history of religious wars, including the chaos occuring in modern times, this books gives an essential understanding of the role of monotheism in its fundamentalist forms to this history. Reading this book changed my entire world view of religion. It's essential reading for everyone, but particularly those who think religion is above criticism. You will not see the world in quite the same way after reading this."
5,Should Be On Every Pagan's Bookshelf!,"I just got the book yesterday and am devouring it. I knew some of this before, but it really comes alive with Kirsch's writing. This book needs to be on every serious Pagan's bookshelf!"
1,War on Monotheism Still Exists Today,"This was written by a Jewish historian, so ANY book you read about religious wars, or religion, need to to be written by someone not biased. The Jews had a dirty hand in getting their version of monotheism in action 5,000 years ago, because they were extremely jealous of the Roman Empire and tired of getting their butts kicked. The historically too-tolerant Pagan Romans and Europeans just welcomed ANY ole' culture and race with their bizarro religions into that part of the world, and as you can see now, multiculturalism does not work. The reason why is because one culture or race will always end up dominating the others. That's why there are continents divided up by oceans, that's why we have nations with land borders... so psychopaths who believe they are the Chosen people of God can have their own living space and nukes and missiles (aimed at every European city), so we don't have to live around them. Stop the hate, separate, not assimilate. Heathen Gliebe"
4,Looks great and works well,I like this toaster. I agree with the other reviews. The only complaint I have and the reason I did not give it a 5 star rating is because I can not hear the beep and it does not seem to be adjustable for volume. I have walked away and forgotten that I had toast on and come back and it was cold or too cool to enjoy the way I want it. It is (IMHO) the best looking oven you can put on your counter.
2,Short Lived,"I LOVED this oven when we got it. We purchased it because we frequently make pizza, and couldn't take the way the regular oven heated up our house in the summer time. We never turned the regular oven on after we bought this little beauty! Unfortunately, after several months of heavy use, the top heating elements just stopped working. It was still under warranty, but I wasn't willing to spent even MORE money to ship it back, and it because useless as it was."
5,Attractive looking and professional functioning,"I love this one after reading all the reviews and even more when seeing it. So excited to see how long it can work well!For someone who says there's missing the crumb tray, it is in the back of the oven, just draw it out below the convection fan. But I still don't know what it is for :) Is it to clean the dirt and crumb falling down from the oven?Overall, I'm very satisfied with the product. This is the highest model of Cuisinart oven, I hope it deserves to its brand name."
5,Best Present,Bought oven as a gift for my husband and it is the best present I ever got him (we have been married for over 20 years)! The pizza from the oven is fantastic and the salmon we did was crisp on the outside and tender on the inside. I have recommended it to all of my friends.
5,Versatile Oven,Great looking product that can be used as a toaster oven and all purpose oven for smaller cooking projects. Saves on warming up a bigger oven most times. I use this oven in my office and it is perfect.
5,Cuisinart BRK-200,"This oven is without a doubt one of the finest table-top appliances we have owned. It is easy to look at, very simple to use, (has dials; not digital), and heats/cooks quickly, especially in the convection mode. The pizza stone makes for great crust! It costs a little more than the rest, but so far it certainly is worth it!"
2,LIL TOO SMALL,"Only problem I have with the brick oven is it's too small. I thought I could use it to make biscuits, popovers, rolls etc while other things cooking in my over. Not anything I wanted to use it for fit in the small area.....so it sits and looks pretty on my counter. Never tried to make pizza in it, but I'm not into making pizza for one."
4,singleguy,"Product looks and functions well, pretty much as advertised. Unit is quiet in convection mode and can be located pretty close rear wall. Top rack tips down for tray removal which takes some practice to avoid burnt fingers. Broiler pan is thin and cheezy but 12x12 alternatives appear to be available. Overall I'm pleased with purchase."
1,Caution !!! Confidence Trikster !,"I bought this brick oven and ordered all space parts directly from Conair.After the had my credit card number, they send me some items I didn`t orderdone ordered item was so insufficient packed, that it arrived broken. After paymentConair refuses any communication. I had to send back all. Now they don`t want to givemy money back !!!Also I wrote to the management - no reaction !Don`t buy from this company !!!!!"
2,disappointing,"Before I ordered this oven, I emailed Cuisinart to find out if there is a timer (you cannot tell from the picture). One week later; still no response. What customer service!!! So I took a chance and ordered it assuming that there is no way a company could produce a cooking appliance with-out a timer shut-off. I was wrong. The only shut-off is for the toaster setting. This was my first and last Cuisinart purchase. I am sending this back!!!"
5,Best cake pan I've ever owned!,Absolutely nothing sticks to this pan. The handles on the ends make it easy to remove from the oven. Priced right too!
2,Disappointing,"I bought this pan primarily for broiling and have used it for over six months. Initially quality seemed good, but I quickly discovered that this pan easily stains and discolors."
4,A MUST FOR HEEP AND HENSLEY FANS,Memories.. is what this album is all about.good memories of hell of a good time long gone.If you are about my age (50)and a Uriah Heep/Ken Hensley fan this is one of the best collection of Heep songs available.
1,Not Various Artists as listed,The song list is correct but this CD box set is not performed by the original artists. Buyer Beware!
3,Definitely one of the better Celtic Albums,"I would avidly recommend this CD to any devoted listener of Celtic music. For those of you who dislike vocal music (like me), this CD only contains one such track, allowing you to enjoy purely instrumental music for the majority of the album. In short, this CD is a very impressive collection of Celtic music with many traditional elements."
4,Adorable,"This outfit is adorable on a little boy! Just make sure and order 1 or 2 sizes up b/c it does run small. My little guy is in a 3T bottom and 4T top and I ordered a 5T. The shirt just fit and the pants were slightly big but was not noticeable in pictures! Very cute, I love the vintage look!"
3,OK,"I thought thast the outfit was adorable, however the blues in the pants, hat and tie were a little bit brighter than I expected.I read some reviews on the outfit and others had said that the sizing ran small. My son is 16lbs and in 3-6 months clothing so I decided to order 9months based on the other reviews. The pants, cap and vest fit; however the shirt was too tight and I was unable to button the top button and he could not wear the neck tie (very disapointing)"
4,Very cute,Very cute outfit - not itchy or stiff like some kids clothes. The hat wasn't great but still cute. Could have been priced cheaper though since thin material
2,Size off....,The shirt was too small while the rest a bit too big. The hat was unbelievably large. I wouldn't really recommend.
4,Nice hat,Nice hat for hubby's fishing- nice fit. Gets a little hot but does the job as far as keeping the sun under control.
5,Great book!,"Excellent book for anyone interested in learning about this helicopter, especially modellers! Read every page with great interest, and refer to often when modelling."
3,Virtuosity without artistry.,"Like reviewer cantabile I must take a minority position on this CD -- and indeed on most recordings by Heifetz. Yes the man was a spectacular virtuoso, but it seems to me that he was usually so busy playing fast and showing off his virtuosity that he paid little attention to artistry. My choice for both of these concertos would be performances by Henryk Szeryng. Regretably Szeryng never achieved the recognition accorded to Heifetz, despite being his equal as a virtuoso. And, to my ears, Szeryng was far superior to Heifetz artistically, using his awesome technique entirely in the service of the music rather for virtuosic display. As I stated at the beginning of this review, my view is a minority one. Still there may be a few music lovers willing to listen with an open mind to Szeryng's performances of these concertos. If so, I think that they will be very pleasantly surprised."
3,technically excellent playing but not musically touching,"Well I remain a little bit reserved of this Heifetz's performance since it could not touch me musically, though undoubtedly it achieves the ultra-supremacy of playing violin. If you have chance, listen to the version played by David Oristarh/Klemperer on Toshiba EMI reissue 2088, the exquisite details is better played and the strcture laid down by Klemperer is more loofty and gorgegous. The sound quality of Heifetz is really nasty if comparing to other RCA golden reissues. The warmth and humanity of Oristarh almost lift you into this passionate piece.Certainly the accompany made by Reiner(One of my favorite) in both Tchaikovsky and Brahms is remarkable and peerless, however the line and musical infection produced by Heifetz are less attractive. He might be a class of its own, but in this piece(Brahms) Oristarh is unbeatable in terms of technical skill and musical interpretation. Try this CD before you fall in love with Heifetz's cult."
3,It was Okay,Nothing too exciting. Simple shirt for casual wear. I didn't particularly like the way it looked on me.
3,shorter than pictured,"I should have listened to the reviews, the top is super short, almost middriff top!! Beware when buying this unless you're looking for a top that falls right at your waistline of your pants. If you lift your arms your stomach will show."
4,Great For Die-Hard Fans of Seasons 1-3,"For those who loved the show's early years, this reunion tape will definitely not dissapoint. It highlights everything from the Tami/David fiasco to Pedro's final days. It's unfortunate, however, that Domininque and Aaron chose not to reunite with their LA housemates. Nevertheless, I found this special very entertaining. Enjoy!"
4,none/all,"this recording is uncompromising. it will not sit and wait for winers that say things like, ""i do not understand free jazz!"" or ""what is this noise!"" this record says ""who cares!"" to those people. joe maneri (sax, voice, piano), his son mat maneri (violins), and barre philips (bass), are master improvisors. in fact this record almoslt plays out like an avant classical work were it not for the plucked bass of philips. all those interested in people streching the limits of jazz and music all around, this is a good album. but be warned: ""NO WINERS ALLOWED!"""
2,Critical review of material required,I have to second the review of the poster that said this should NOT be your single source. There is too much advice based on the opinion of a single mountaineer. And at times the recommendations seem questionable. It's as if the author is taking an opinion opposite to Freedom of the Hills to build his own credibility. Freedom of the Hills is still the BEST single source. And Alpine Climbing by Houston and Cosley is a better alternative for those looking for a book with more advanced skills.
4,"Great book, for experienced climber","Get this if you want beta on some advanced and cutting edge techniques. Has alot of solid info on general topics, but there are some techniques recommended that a reader should have adequate experience to evaluate for his/her climbing before implementing."
2,Pontification and Insufficient Illustrations,"This book is less about mountaineering and more about the authors opinions or personal approach. You cannot read this book and feel as though you've been properly introduced to the various components of mountaineering. The Mountaineers publication is far superior.There are places where specific techniques are described in text, but not illustrated. It seems counter intuitive to use only text to describe what is predominately a practical sport/endeavor."
2,A collection of old info with a lot of biases,This is an okay book if you already have several others and want another viewpoint. It should NOT be the only book you buy. There are too many errors and strong biases scattered throughout to make it a one-source reference. Freedom of the Hills (latest edition) is still a better resource if you're just going to have one. The Houston/Cosley book is more up to date and better researched. Twight's book is getting dated but still has good info for those who are pushing harder.
3,Really useful,"Preaching lightweight and speedy mountaineering with passion and conviction The Mountaineering Handbook makes an interesting and enjoyable reading. What is more important, it is really useful. I have benefited from reading The Mountaineering Handbook several years ago. Yet some advice contained in the book must be taken with caution. Here and there, in his zeal to be original ('new school'), the author promotes potentially unsafe procedures. For this reason I give 3 stars to this otherwise excellent work."
2,madras pants,I thought I was ordering madras as stated but instead bluw oxford pants arrived. Will not buy from this site again.
4,"Very Good workout, boring teachers","I bought this DVD based on other reviews in Amazon. There are 3 short workouts. If you really want to burn calories, I recommend you do all 3, it will take you about one hour.The routines are good, but the instructors are really boring. When they talk it seems as if they were reading from a prompt. That is why I am giving this 4 instead of 5."
2,Only two-third of the film is funny,"- It's a musical film and beautiful.- The songs and dances are upbeat and dance inspiring.- The costumes are attractive.- The acting is okay.- There are some humorous scenes here and there but not much. For example, the scene where Aladin came to Jasmine's martial art class.- The plot drags in many scenes. If the movie was 90 minutes long instead of 130 as stated on the back cover, it would be better."
5,A long-awaited alternative to Costanzo,"The Seifter Physiology text is a much-needed alternative to the Costanzo Physio text. Well-written and well-integrated clinically, this book is well worth buying first or second-year (as well as in preparation for the USMLE Step 1 exam). ""Concepts in Medical Physiology"" employs new visual and educational techniques, as well as authentic USMLE-format questions, to make this an upgrade (IMHO) to Costanzo. I am very happy with it."
1,Authors need help,Many of the chapters seem to me to be written more to promote recall of isolated facts rather than understanding of the overall processes. One of out medical school pathways uses this book and the students seem to lack the ability to synthesize informaiton. I suggest the authors get help from someone with a real degree in physiology.
1,This book is a falsehood.,This book is based on fabrication and falsehood. Do not believe one word written by the author. This is the most culturally insensitive book I have read. It does a grave injustice to the native people of Australia. This is a self-serving book used to propagate a New Age philosophical agenda unconcerned with the culture it purports to exemplify.
1,What a stupid piece of junk!,"I'm sorry to be so forward, because each person who writes a book deserves respect because he/she has tried to say something about himself. And if she publishes by herself, it really has merit. But it is the only one I see. This book is very new age, very spiritual and it looks like many people in this world find it useful, but I can only think how void of sense their lives are if this silly, childish search help them. It is pretentious and grandiloquent. Perhaps I am very rationalist and skeptical, and this book is a kind of run-of-the-mill Platonism and Hegelianism: this world is not the real Reality, our life is not the real life, but there is a better one somewhere sometime if you just stop thinking and follow... what? I would say to those who find it so interesting: why don't you try to read philosophy, for instance, Bertrand Russell and think?"
5,Mutant Message Down Under,"Why are so many so quick to shoot the messenger? If taken in the proper light, this book has a very rare life-changing quality. It is highly suspect why so many reviewers take the offensive stance. Do not let the negative reviews sway your opinion whether or not to read this book. This book can be a journey into yourself and your place in the cosmos as well as that of humanity. If you resonate with the desire to lift your consciousness....then read this book."
4,Mutant Message Down Under,One is left with the unanswered feelings concerning how much of the story the author would have you belive to be true and how much is fiction. An interesting tale. The woman who would live it would be a most unusual person.
4,Mutant Message Down Under Critique,"The book Mutant Message was very educational in the values and beliefs of realism. This book was not only interesting, it also gave the reader a new outlook on life and other cultures. It was an easy read filled with adventure and compassion. We recommend this book to mature adults (high school senior level). This book deals with real life contreversial issues. We rated it a four star!"
5,Mutant Message Down Under,"This is an amazing true story. If you have ever lived, visited or dreamed of Australia I recommend reading this book. It absorbs the reader from the first page and takes you on a journey through the outback that will open your mind and touch your heart.You will better understand the Australian Aboriginal culture and I reckon, a bit more about yourself too."
5,For Adding Depth to your character by culture and maturity,"This book there is no clone for.I believe thier Dreamtime they were nude and so nude on earth.This book says they are leaving this Plane of reality,to new guardians.That Makes me sad.I hope more of ther culture will be preserved in Libraries,there is one movie,Photography and books.I would love to meditate in sacred opal lined caves the made for religious ceremonies.They have kabongs which are totems,Oracle of the Dreamtime by Donni Hakason is good with this book."
3,Some questions for thoughtful readers,"Thank you Marlo for sharing your experience.I appreciate the possibilities you showed me.After 2 years, I figured out who the God of this book is.This God believes the spiritual state is better than the physical state. This God has a spiritual body but not a physical body. This God wants the aborigines to return to their supposedly superior spiritual life and stay there. (He doesn't mention resurrection.)This God says people may stop reproducing. The only true God has not modified his command to multiply and replenish the earth.The God of this book says the earth is dying. I guess he can't do anything about that.Even though Marlo learned a lot, the ""real"" people violated her free agency when they kidnapped her and made her go on this trek.For me, the real message of these ""real"" people is to develop more faith in my God, Jesus Christ. The possibilities are endless."
1,What can I say?,"Yes, this book is full of misinformation about Aboriginal life and culture - the fact that the real Aboriginal custodians of the area she claims to have been in have been so offended - and mounted a campaign pointing out her many ridiculous errors - are testament to that. For those of you who do not understand the criticisms of the book, it is not just its fictional aspect that has caused problems. For one thing, Aboriginal people are tired of having white people speak for them and the claim that this group chose a white American to transmit their message (even fictionally)is offensive to many. Please celebrate Aboriginal culture but make it the real one, the one real people live, not a white fantasy. Also the idea that these people are apparently dieing is too much like the ideas the 19th -20th governments used to ignore Aboriginal issues and steal children as 'they'll all be dead soon anyway'. Aboriginal people are a living people - not a metaphor for spiritual enlightment."
2,Comment,"While an interesting tale, it may be of interest to readers to know that the elders of many Aboriginal communities in Australia, including communities in Western Australia, from whence originate the 'tribe' this woman claims to have been with, deny the authenticity and 'facts' quoted herein. In fact, the most polite thing many of these elders have had to say is that it is a white woman's fantasy"
1,An offensive fantasy tale,"Mutant Message Down Under is a work of bizaare fantasy. Marlos original claims that this book was based on fact are highly offensive to Indigenous Australians. The author romanticises an ideal of the 'noble savage'. It is precisely this type of book that perpeptuates neo-colonialism. I suggest the author was suffering a 'mid life crisis', in which she attempted to use and invent a fictional notion of Indigenous culture for her own self satisfaction. Not worth reading! If you are interested in the topic, try one of Henry Reynolds book, or Richard Broomes. There are many credible sources that detail the cultures of Indigenous Australians. But Mutant Message Down Under is not one of them!"
1,Mutant Message Hoax?,I started reading this book at the suggestion of a friend and very quickly felt that something was wrong. Although I have never read any other books about Australian aborigines I had a gut feeling that much of this was made up. I did a quick search on [the internet] under the author's name and came up with a critique by an Australian anthropologist which should be read in its entirety.
5,Awesome Messages!,"I just read this amazing book that a friend recommended. After reading it, I of course read the reviews and see that many people consider the author a great fabricator. Personally, I believe the story is true for many reasons. I also think that when stories such as this with such deep meaning are told, they come with all sorts of people trying to discredit them for numerous reasons. All of the life messages that the author tells about in the ""walkabout"" are the same messages that some of the most profound influential ""spiritual"" people around the world have tried to pass on to us. And many of us are desperately trying to live our lives that way....with more kindness, compassion, humility, less materialism, less fear, and more love. There are few out there that really get it, but through books like this, I think slowly things are shifting and people are beginning to understand the true meaning of life."
1,Plaigarism and bandwagonning galore,"I was immediately struck by the similarities between this book and two others I have read recently. The first is ""The Celestine Prophecy"" by James Redfield which is a fictionalised account of how the writer became caught up in a hunt for an ancient manuscript in Peru. On the way he met corrupt officials, shady government agents, benign monks and various enlightened natives. Obviously, he picked up a lot of New Age baloney at the same time. Plotwise, very similar to MMDU. The second book is ""Amazon Beaming"" and concerns a bearded photographer chasing aboriginal natives in Brazil. He loses all his possesions and treks for weeks through the jungle gaining insights and so on. By the way, the natives are telepathic. Is this all sounding familiar? I would say that MMDU is the mutant child of these two books at least. Also, since neither of its parents were very good, MMDU is downright dismal..."
5,Absolutely riveting.,"What an amazing story. Even if it is fiction, I was thoroughly spellbound. I wonder how many people, not just women, could have survived such an ordeal. I gave the book to at least 6 different people to read, all told me that they loved it. I would love to know what has happend to the author since the book was published."
3,"Interesting book, all depends on your view of it.","This book is a neet story, but I agree it is a little hard to swallow as an actual event. I was confused by the beginning where she prints a disclaimer, but I think this was done in order to give her more leeway in the relaying of the story. I don't know how she could make this all up, but I am still foggy on the details that she does provide as not fitting together very well. If you just read it as a story, there is much to learn from the message and it is beautifully written. I think we'd all like to believe there are still people like the Real People on earth somewhere."
5,"Good, down to earth read!","I purchased this book because i loaned it out a few years ago and never saw it again. It's lovely. It's also good for people who are looking for a relaxing kind of book, one that doesn't get you too worked up."
3,What inspires you is irrelevant; it's being inspired that counts : ),"A fun, thoughtful and, at times, moving little book; compares well to the 'Celestine Prophecies' in that it makes some very important esoteric or spiritual `truths' available in a simple, straightforward style. Consequently, some may find it a touch contrived at times. Obviously, a big debate still rages about whether the events described actually took place, but that, for me, misses the point. If you gain insights into yourself and embrace ideas that resonate authentically within you - if you find yourself taking one small step towards being a happier, freer person - who cares what prompted you to do so? The important thing is that something did. Right?Whether you enjoy this book or not, I would heartily recommend `Tuesdays with Morrie' and `Jonathan Livingston Seagull'."
3,"good lessons, good read.","I learned alot from this book, I don't think it exploited the natives at all, in fact I developed an awareness for thier culture. I find it interesting that the natives in every society are pushed out and regarded as uncivilized. I really think its this excessive consumerism that plagues all these fat americans and beyond as uncivilized. I was completely surprised at the angry reviews this book has received on this board, as I was led to this book by an instructor. I really enjoyed it. I've shared it with friends. Pooey on you meanies!"
1,Mutant Message,"MUTANT MESSAGE DOWN UNDERThe familiar message is always worth repeating, that civilization's progress is harmful to the environment. However, the theme of the ""noble savage"" with mystical, super-natural powers and knowledge is so exaggerated it dashes any authenticity of the story. This sort of speculation is done frequently -- James Hilton, Carlos Castenada, etc -- and panders to attitudes of wishful thinking among readers.Is it a good book? Yes, if you enjoyed reading it.Is it true? Of course not."
4,Excellent info,"In my opinion, the import of this book cannot be overstated. I read it in the mid-90's and it effects me everyday. The Westernized mind can use every possible wake up call. This one resonates for me. I've given countless copies to friends and family."
2,Maybe or maybe not,"About halfway through, I reread Marlo Morgan's introduction. Having done so, I pondered the photo reproduced on the back cover. Now I'm asking: if a person has learned the ""truths"" she claims to have learned, why would that person continue to color her hair and enhance (?) her appearance with makeup.I do like the suggestion to ""spit out"" what seems irrelevant. You may want to spit out the book as a whole because it probably is not really based on actual experience. Or you may choose to use it as food for thought.My suggestion: before you spend $$ and psychic energy on this book, check it out by googling ""Marlo Morgan"" and then make up your own mind."
3,unfortunately....it's fiction,"At first, since I've been enthralled by Australia and aboriginal culture, I read this and loved it. Without thinking, without engaging critical analysis. But then I started putting together the pieces and comparing this book with all the others I've read and wondering about the discrepancies. So, this book becomes a 3 star instead of 5. Although the concensus of Aboriginal peoples seems to be that this book is an outrage, I did find many concepts worth turning over in my mind. So, beware...don't be taken in as I was before doing research."
2,Shaky at best...,"I had hoped for much more from this book. It is, in fact, very new age, and very _very_ far from interesting outside of that context. Inside that context it is questionable at best. Just not a readable book."
3,"Remember, it is fiction...","Suggested read from a friend in a book club, I was was aware of it being fiction and not necessarily a true story, although it reads a bit like one. As a story it is a bit thin, but the lessons and paradigm of thinking about our world and how we interact with each other was great. I am glad I read it, was not bored at all, and do recommend reading it as long as you are aware it may not be factual about the Aborigines and Australia."
4,Powerful Journey,"Simply, could not put this book down. I found it to be very spiritual. Demonstrates that we all have something to learn and to give. Our way of life is good but after reading about her journey we have an obligation and responsibility to make our life and world better. To live in a world without judgement and to accept with grace which we find and to accept oneness.A must read for all"
1,Angry at your censorship,"I am very angry at your preventing publication of a critique I know to have been submitted to you by an Aboriginal friend, Suze Collette, of Brisbane.If anyone can seriously critique this collection of lies that enormously damage Aborigines, it has to be an Aborigine.All you are obviously concerned with is the enormous money this evil work is raking in.You should also have a window that allows negative ratings. Technically one can't publish here without awarding at least one star. That is madness for a work that deserves a billion negatives."
1,pissed,This book is poorly written. How can someone profit from another traditional culture? Makes me sick to think how much money she has made proporting that what she experienced in the Australian backcountry as true.
3,"Good ""Quest"" Book for Teenagers","This book could be used at the High School level to provide teenagers with an introduction to the contrasts between Western cultures and aboriginal cultures. It is easy to read and probably has a Fogg Index around 8 or 9. Like one of the all-time favorites, Heinlein's ""Glory Road"", a typical, ordinary westerner is suddenly transported into a fantasy world of adventure. This is a relatively painless way of introducing the idea of comparitive anthropology and invites the young reader to question arbitrary Western assumptions."
5,A Matter of Serenity,"Being Australian,having spent quite some time in the Outback as well as collecting information for my knowledge bank on how Aboriginal people think, believe and behave is not far from the truth about which Marlo Morgan has written.Many people speak of wrongful facts, but from where I sit, a great deal of the story rings true.Aboriginals downunder are quite amazing, their way of life is one to be envied.Spirituality is an individual state of mind, along with the serenity which comes from within.I would highly recommend this mesmerizing story for readers looking for the ultimate in escape.-Yvonne Bornstein, Author, Eleven Days of Hell"
2,Take It For What It Is: Fiction. Period.,"I read this book in my 20s, and then again 2 years ago. It is charming and weaves in many of the indigenous traditions that we'd all like to incorporate into our lives. However, this book is a work of fiction and has very little to do with authentic aboriginal culture. This taints the credibility of the author and her book. So, let it inspire you to seek out authentic indigenous lifeways. But be sure to take this book for what it is: fiction."
5,Inspirational,"I read this book a couple of years ago and really enjoyed it. I recomended it to many friends, most of who enjoyed it also. Don't touch this book though a) if you are you are a skeptic (stick to something more scientific and tangible and languish there where you feel comfortable), b) are offended by simple truths, c) are more deeply concerned whether the book is fiction or non-fiction than the message within d)if you can't get your head round the fact that despite outward appearances all humans belong to one race. For readers with an open mind, you may or may not enjoy the book, but there is a message within for everyone if you care to look."
2,Couldn't help ridiculing,"This book was recommended by a new acquaintance who said it, ""changed her life"". I bought the book because I could certainly use a little enlightenment. Alas! This seems a really silly place to find it. The writing is awful -- I don't have the book in front of me, but I could pull out about any sentence for ridicule. There were times where I thought, okay, that's a decent thought, it's a sweet story, (hence the two stars), but by the end I found myself ridiculing it, and thinking this book, and its popularity, is further evidence of the dumbing down of America."
1,AUDIO TAPES??? EEEUUGGGGHHHH,AUDIO TAPES NOW!!!!....WHAT NEXT T-SHIRTS OF THE AUTHOR PAINTED UP IN TRADITIONAL MOTIFS...I MEAN COME ON NOW....IF THIS ISN'T THE BIGGEST MONEY MAKING VENTURE OFF THE BACKS OF ABORIGINAL AUSTRALIA I DON'T KNOW WHAT IS!....THE QUESTION SHOULD BE ASKED....WHY DOESN'T ABORIGINAL AUSTRALIA RECEIVE ANY OF THIS SMALL FORTUNE...THE ANSWER....BECAUSE THIS IS SOLELY THE MARLO MORGAN RETIREMENT FUND...AND WHOEVER BUYS INTO THIS **** IS MAKING A CONTRIBUTION.....
2,Should not have been in the non fiction catagory!,"This is supposedly a true story of a woman kidnapped and 'forced' to do a walkabout with an Aboriginal tribe called the Real People. While a very spiritual book, I find it terribly hard to put this in a non fiction catagory.I believe Ms. Morgan took bits and pieces of stories and beliefs she has heard and tried to make them her own. And in doing so, created a very unbelievable list of characters and situations.If the book had been written as fiction I believe I would have enjoyed it more, and found the unbelievable to be acceptable. As it was, I spent more time shaking my head at what we are expected to believe is real.Read this book if you want a quick spirtual fix, but take it with a grain of salt!"
1,Just stick to the facts,"Marlo received the ""Bent Spoon Award"" from the Australian Skeptics assoc. in 1996 for this book."
2,Mutant Message A Boring Book,My sister said she was reading this book and I should buy it. I did read some reviews and they were negitive but I thought I would be open minded. I read half the book and it was so boring I could not go on. A waste of my money and wish I could get a refund now.
1,"New-age philosophies, pseudo-science, and quackery","When approached with the idea of doing an all school read of the Mutant Message, I agreed. I was under the impression that it was a slightly fictionalized version of actual events. I also believed that it had been written by a journalist, though I now realize that was entirely a construction of my assumptions and bias. I thought that, like A Million Little Pieces, Mutant Message Down Under may embellish a few facts or even completely fabricate characters and events, but the quality of writing and core truth of the story would more than make up for a few flourishes of falsehood. What I found instead was a tome loaded with sentences barely recognizable as English, enhanced by a ""gravy"" (185) of convoluted figurative language and constructed on a foundation of 17th century ""noble savage"" racism cemented into a grotesque argument for new age philosophies, pseudoscience, and quackery.Read more [...]"
1,Cliched and Patronizing,"The book is really easy to read and entertaining and maybe it makes us think of how good or not good is our relationship with nature. But that is about it. It is completely cliched and patronizing. I think is very silly and stereotypical the way she pictures the Western people as being so materialist and so far away from understanding nature. Was her life really so shallow and superficial before coming to this ""spiritual journey""?"
2,Ho Hum,"As I read this work there was a nagging feeling in the back of my brain that the whole thing was so familiar to me. So very familiar. . . .Then it hit me! The Kin of Ata Are Waiting for You. This book is a direct repeat of the same ideas that Dorothy Bryant put forth in her work of 32 years ago. I have no doubt that Ms. Morgan is quite familiar with the earlier work.While Bryant's portrayal of the symbolic journey of the soul is told subtly and with rich symbolism, Morgan has a tendency toward redundancy and heavy-handedness.My advice? Skip this one. . .read the real deal. You won't be sorry."
1,What a shocker!,"As an Anglo Australian, I find myself confronted and hugely irritated by this inane book. That Marlo Morgan managed to sell so many thousands upon thousands of copies is beyond me until I remember the 'television audience' mentality that many have in the new age today. It is a pain just thinking about what this story entails - fiction touted as fact - and damaging to many aboriginal people as well as it portrayed them and their culture as something they are not.To be sure, it is also a laughable matter, reading this book. It's kind of like mixing an image of a television soap with a science fiction fantasy.My biggest concern is the fact that our (Australia's) beloved aboriginal elder, Burnham Burnham become involved in the story, touring with Marlo Morgan. I feel his spirit was broken from his association with this fiction and, indeed, he passed away in a cloud that shouldn't have been around him.Sad... and it's still rating well on Amazon. Pity."
3,"in spite of controversy, offers food for thought","There is much controversy about this book regarding its status as truth or fiction, but it deserves 3 stars, possibly more, for its concept of a community as it should be in many ways. The members exist peacefully with one another and the land, live very simply without the need for ownership and with a deep awareness of their connection to all things. Despite its 'new age' overtones and tendency to go overboard in some areas, there is much food for thought."
1,"Terrible, horrible, false","I have spent two years of my life living with Australian Aboriginals, and I can tell you that this book was inauthentic from page one. It does not accurately depict how Aboriginals talk or act. It is a get-rich attempt to cash in on the ""Celestine Prophecy"" type ""the primitives must be smarter than us"" gravy train. It is the worst kind of ""noble savage"" tripe. At least if she had offered it as fiction, it would have been just juvenile. But to offer it as fact is simply dishonest. Obviously she was trying to start a cult following and become a celebrity. As a professional anthropologist, I deeply resent this kind of lying, and all of her readers should resent being lied to. If you want an authentic Aboriginal experience, rent the movie ""Rabbit Proof Fence."" No romantic claptrap there, just honest portrayals of the courage and struggles of Aboriginals, who are not supernatural beings but humans just like you and me."
2,You're all correct on this one,"I've enjoyed the mixed reviews on this book at least as much as I enjoyed the book. Most of the reviews are most insightful (into the reviewer if not the book). This book is syrupy sweet new age regurgitation, and it certainly is fiction. If you like that kind of thing (Wayne Dyer approved!), then enjoy. Think of it as 'Spiritualism for Beginners'. Easy to read, easy to put down, easy to dismiss if you don't agree with it."
2,I don't think so,"First off, I think Marlo Morgan is a genius. Except her intelligence does not lay in her supposed ""experience"" in the outback but with her ability to tap into the heart beat of America's needy culture and see exactly what it is thirsy for. Both Australia and new age philosophy have been the ""flavor of the month"" for the average American for quite some time now, and I'm sure it was simple for Ms Morgan for create a simply written piece of ""fiction"" that would easily find its place upon the bookshelves of every major bookstore in the country. If the aboriginals are so brillant, WHY did they choose her?"
4,Moving Message,"I bought this book because of a book club I am in. I was surprised at how interesting the novel was, and was moved by the message. I enjoyed the message about we, the takers of the earth and the givers being the first people. I would recommened this book because of what it has to say, and also it is a quick read."
4,Simply amazing,"I found the account of Marlo's walkabout simply amazing, and I really believe the things that she recounts. It's true that this story is beyond civilized man's understanding, but I think that this is only because civilization has isolated us from our instincts, and we've lost touch with the natural world to a great extent. The book raises issues that I was already thinking about, regarding the way that humans interact with our planet. It makes me wonder whether we will ever fully realize how quickly we are destroying this planet, before it's too late to reverse our actions."
1,No Stars,"This was dreadful...Very poorly written, boring, and obvious fiction made to look like nonfiction. Amazon - please give us a no star category...this one doesn't deserve the one star I was forced to give it."
1,Total disrespect for another's cultural beliefs,"I read this book a few years ago, with utter disbelief. As the review above states, there is no way this woman knew anything about Australia, apart from what she may have garnered off the internet. I rate this book 1 star only because there wasn't a zero star option.It is a fact across all Aboriginal peoples (and there are more than 1) that a man would NEVER reveal any tribal secrets to a woman and vice versa. This one fact alone tells me the book is utter rubbish. I'm only sorry the Aborigines of Australia could not take a class action against this woman. Don't buy the book. Come to Australia and see for yourself."
3,Interesting substance badly served,"I am from Down Under and thoroughly enjoyed the spritual journey into the Abo's minds and culture - I hated the trite nonsense which Marlo served us up. Was it just bad editing?? did two people write the book??? It was like exquisite meal served up on plastic Micky Mouse plates. She hasn't done justice to the Aboriginis - she has insulted them by her trite little homilies at the end of most chapters - ""If only they were world leaders"" etc. One can describe the book using Marla's style as a great present badly wrapped, pearls among the swine, silk purses and sow's ears."
5,It is a fantastic book that should be read by all.,"This is a truly wonderful tale of a woman's journey through Australia. Some say the book is a bit slow and pointless, but one must look just a bit deeper into the meaning of the story. The adventures she encounters and the things she learns on her journey are lessons everyone should learn. If you haven't read this book i suggest you order it. Enjoy!"
4,A spiritual message for seekers.,"Mutant Message Down Under is a beautifully written story. Simple without being simplistic. The intention of the author in my opinion was to simply relay the stories and experiences she encountered among the Aboriginal peoples. Approach this book with a sense of anticipation for an adventure, a hope for discovering more of the truth we all seek, and an appreciation for the fact that modern civilization, the mutants, may not have it right. I applaud Ms. Morgan for her willingness to share the experience and endure the criticism and at times hostilities she has been exposed to. The truth, as painful as it may be, does set us free."
5,"Compelling, enlightening, empowering and simply wonderful.","This book is a compelling revelation of the responsibilities that Human ""Mutants"" must re-discover. I found this book to be joyous, sad and frightening. Joyous in the discovery and explanation for some experiences that I could relate to on this journey, sad for the people that might not ever receive this message and frightening in the realization of the hidden truth, that we are so afraid to see.Those whom have been given the gift of this reading, have been opened to an awareness that entails a great responsibility. I am hopeful that we are on a path to recognizing the true purpose of our being and making the changes in our lives necessary to provide the universal oneness that is meant to be."
1,Help!!!,"I gave up on this less than half-way through. This is based on truth, I suspect, only in Ms. Morgan's New Age agenda dreams. Otherwise, it is pure hokum and not worth anyone's reading time."
4,Sometimes I wonder,"How people communicate using their hearts, their methods of survival, how to really appreciate the things that are given.A life which I have yet experience."
4,Excellent Book!,"I read this book immediately after visiting Australia. I found it to represent very well the little bit of Aboriginal culture I witnessed. The Aborigines are a very private people so it doesn't surprise me that they discounted everything written in this book. How many other cultures have we destroyed because of our 'fascination' with their difference? Because of their private nature, I couldn't understand their life. I came back from Australia craving knowledge about a culture so very different than our own. 'Mutant Message Down Under' fulfilled my need to learn more. It was very easy reading. I don't know if everything written is true, but even if just a little bit was, I learned more than I knew before reading this book. Learning is understanding; understanding is knowledge; knowledge is power"
1,Sentimental Fraud,"The book is a fabrication, as the author has admitted -- Google for ""Apology to Australian Elders"" to see the details.If you are American, try imagining how you would react to a similar book which purported to be about a lost tribe of Native Americans -- you probably wouldn't believe it. It's only because Australia is far away from this book's target market, and Aboriginal culture is almost completely unknown to its readers, that the author managed to get away with her fraud.And if you knew this book was a fantasy novel, you would be less likely to respond with the awe and emotion that more gullible readers have reported. There are genuine communities of people on this Earth who lead lives which are exemplary in some respects; so there is really no excuse for inventing a new breed of ""noble savage""."
1,Find Enlightenment Elsewhere.,"This book is a waste of time. It is racist, egocentric babble that left me angry, annoyed and dismayed it could be published (to acclaim!) in the 20th century. This book reeks of white privledge and ignorance. I have read the many positive reveiews on this site and I seriously can't find what these people are talking about."
3,Who's her podiatrist?,"From the title I initially thought this book was about strange messages from that certain place where the sun don't shine to the rest of your body, but it's actually a very different sort of book. Still, I have enough trouble getting my teenage daughter's meaning correct, so the last thing on my mind is worrying about ""mutant meanings from downunder."" But Dr. Morgan went 1400 miles on a walkabout with a group of Australian aborigines, and whether the revelations in this book are true or not, I at least have to admire her podiatric fortitude, since I count myself lucky these days if I can just make it to the fridge and back one more time to score another Foster's."
2,An outpour of confusion,"Somewhat well written yet extremely unbelievable. If it was sold as a fiction story, it would be great, but who knows? For the most part, and entertaining break from reality--but: somebody please help me decide wether this book is fact or fiction. I have had intense debates with friends and family members about the authenticity over this story. I am losing sleep! I beg of you, your opinion, and if you wish, email me at miltonp729@home.com --sincere thanks to all"
1,So badly written that the message barely comes through,"I enjoyed reading everyone else's Amazon reviews a lot more than the book itself! It's good to see so many people interested enough in a subject to take the time to comment -- positively or negatively.Yes, I understand the need for more ecological harmony in the world. Yes, I think that there are people out there who live more balanced lives than Westerners. Morgan's message was so trite and obvious that there really wasn't anything new to learn in it. And it was so badly written that the message could barely show through at all.I don't think that asking a writer to communicate well is being a jaded literary snob. The purpose of language is to deliver ideas; badly used language delivers ideas badly. Ultimately it leads to more dire consquences than simply a few hours wasted on a bad book.One of my favorite quotes, attributed to Confuscious: ""If what is said is not what is meant, then all that is to be done remains undone."""
1,Disgraceful,"A patronising piece of Americanese of the worst kind. As an Australian I am deeply insulted by this book and by the author's pathetic attempts to portray it as some sort of truth - a truth it could not be further from.Imagine the uproar if an Australian woman - one who had never been to America much less bothered to meet any native Americans -imagine if she attempted to sell a manufactured piece of garbage on native American culture to the rest of the world. Can you imagine the backlash?Apart from it's amateurish writing, clunky syntax and embarrasingly bad errors per paragraph (there are no phone booths in the outback lovey) - I am insulted for my country. But far, far more deeply, I am insulted for indigenous Australians. They have suffered enough indignity and cultural rape - this book is just one more example of it. May the author hang her head in shame."
1,An arrogant white fantasy,"Unbelievable -- an author who has clearly never met an aboriginal person tells us that she, personally, was chosen as the single vehicle for thousands of years of wisdom by a tribe who has decided to die off (actually, aboriginal people are very much trying to survive).Some of the author's claims about aboriginal people are clearly New Age fantasies or misplaced ideas about Native Americans -- for instance, she has aboriginal people making ""dream catchers"" and being called by Native American sounding names -- things that are obviously erroneous to almost any Australian.On top of it, she uses very insulting language to refer to all of the aboriginal people who are not part of her ""Real People"" tribe (i.e., they are all lazy, corrupted ""..."").Just search in any search engine for ""Mutant Message Down Under"" to get the real deal and hear from the people Morgan is making all her money off of."
1,Exploitative drivel,"Subsequently proven to be a complete pack of lies, this book is a deeply cynical, mendacious, grossly inaccurate and offensively racist account of the Australian Aboriginals.Marlo Morgan tells of an odyssey of spiritual transformation joining a group of Aboriginals (""real people"") on walkabout through Australia. Despite her professed reverence for the ""tribe"", her book is littered with insincere and patronising platitudes that jostle for attention amidst the thinly veiled racism, describing her ""travelling companions"" as ""half-cast"", ""half-breed"", ""natives"" with feet ""like hooves"". Despite her alleged epiphany, Morgan retains the persona of an aloof, superior, white imperialist schoolmarm.This book has never been released in Australia. I wonder why...The unacceptable face of greedy 1990's surrogate spirituality as an offshoot of 1980's materialism."
1,Can I give it zero stars?,"While reading this book, I underwent several stages of repulsion: disbelief that such an inarticulate writer could be published; disgust at the author's unwavering egotism; skepticism of the book's illusory events; and finally outrage at the fact the Marlo Morgan degraded an entire culture to benefit herself. Having read this book, I am now more stupid because of it. I am well aware this book is a complete work of fraud, but nonetheless it has planted a grossly distorted view of Aboriginal culture in my mind. My real concern is for the readers who actually believe this book is true."
1,A comment by an Australian,"This book shows a paucity of understanding of Australian aboriginal customs and culture. It is a naive, personalized and vain misinterpretation of something that is far too complex for the author to ever come to terms with. As such, it is of little value, other than perhaps, providing evidence of how mixed-up, lonely Westerners in the late 20th century are becoming lost and gullible. In itself, it could well be used as the basis for humor!"
4,great unreleased tracks!,"what a great disk,why in the world most of these songs didn't make it the official albums is beyond my ears,especially the unreleased track from ""fallen angel"",'a right to live'.other highlights include,'split image(no guitar in ear sight),just a synth driven track,great vocals from peter goalby(my second fave heep singer,you know who's best!),'high and mighty'outtake'name of the game'is another great heep heft-rocker and probably better than anything off that album.so why only 4 stars?,due to the fact that there's too many tracks from the bernie shaw era(sorry,but he's a really cheezy vocalist)and he does really sabotage the live tracks of older byron-sung classics."
3,not so rare,"this compilation has songs that have been previously been released. if you have the newer remastered heep, you probably have these. the liner notes say that heeps audio vault is deep. then, they should have released unreleased material, rather than cuts that are already available. i don't think the heep need another best of, or a comp of recycled material."
4,Good value for the money,"For its small price tag, this book delivers what is promised. I got one solid idea from it for my planned Japanese garden that had not occurred to me before & that made it well worth the price. (The idea was using small stones as ground cover, juxtaposed with larger stones. You need to see the pictures to understand how to do it).My only negative is I would have liked more pictures & descriptions of small-space, backyard gardens. Many of the pictures showed 300 year old gardens or ones that require a park in your backyard to create them.Overall I enjoyed the book, and when I want to feel zen-like, I can just pick it up & look at the pictures. :-))"
4,ortho Japanese Gardens- better than most chem-brand garden books,"I picked up a copy of this book for $3 at the local Ollie's (surplus discount store) after I had already created a zen garden under the shade of my upstairs deck.It was packed with enough ideas and great inspirational pics to cause me to expand and add onto my zen garden and plan for more.I can't really complain about the thinness of the book, as I paid $3 for it, but I'd rate this a 4 because I wish there was just a bit more to it, and for it's size I don't think it is work $9 plus shipping via amazon. If a Japanese garden is up your alley, browse around and get this for next to nothing.as far as garden books sponsored by lawn and garden chemicals go, it was well done- a good brisk read and lots of great pics, as well as a pretty comprehensive guide in the back on plants to use."
5,All about the essentials in creating a Japanese garden,"This is a practical book filled with essential insights about creating and maintaining a Japanese garden. It takes up all kinds of details about rock gardening, stones, gates, ponds, paths and plant selections. It is a very useful book for the persons interested in the Japanese garden architecture."
4,Japanese Gardens,"Good Information material to start a project. Great pictures, easy reading. Complete description. I will Recomend this product to my friends ."
4,Nice book for ideas,Great for ideas nice pictures and information. Good info about different plants. Nice to have for the coffee table. thanks
1,There's nothing charming about this book!,"My daughters were taught from this book at a Wednesday night class at our church. After seeing how intensely non-Biblical the information being taught was, my husband pulled them out of the class! Him and I agree that our daughters need to grow in the Lord by learning who they are in God's eyes. This book only seems to focus on things that people find important, not what God shows us to be important when reading the Bible. After taking these classes, my daughters were both depressed about what this idiotic book would consider their shortcomings. Things that the Bible doesn't even mention.This book is a prescription for one of two things:1. A girl to turn into the kind of person who thinks she's perfect and as such better than everyone else.2. A girl who ends up with eating disorders and distorted self image because they can't be perfect.DUMP THIS BOOK! READ WHAT THE BIBLE SAYS ABOUT WHAT A GODLY WOMAN SHOULD BE!"
1,Just...no.,"As the previous reviewer said, the character building tips are generic and can be found anywhere else. The clothing and beauty tips are a scream. Some of the advice is ridiculous and offensive--for example, in the ""How Feminine Are You?"" Quiz, you get points off if your voice is deep and gravelly. And yes, this is really a part of the same book, it just isn't available on the Amazon preview pages. Please, if you have any love and respect for your daughters, DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK. Except maybe for laughs."
1,The last trip of the Behemoth,"The reminiscences of a young IJNAF officer, Mitsuru Yoshida, onboard for the last trip of the powerful IJNS Yamato on April, 1945 off Okinawa, translated word by word and almost verse by verse from the Japanese.As a matter of fact, journals and diaries whatever the subject, war, peace, love, adventure, etc. are a bit boring, because they use to describe a day-by-day routine. This book is no exception. It would be better if the author's next-of-kin could have chosen a ghost writer to give a more historical perspective giving it into a more ""readable"" appearance. As it was, there was too little but a lot of personal and almost poetic emotions filing the pages. The subject is very interesting - a decisive battle seen from the loser's point-of-view - and practically nothing was said about the details of the clash itself."
3,Enviromental Modeling with GIS and Remote Sensing,"This is not a lite reading book. It is however and excellent reference book one that I highly recommend for anyone's library interested in GIS, remote sensing and their applications - It covers the use of these relatively new tools within various scientific discliplnes, very useful and still up to date formulas, tables and charts and references for further investigation. Very technical and very applicable. Not recommended for everyone."
1,Who can bring together a group of pre-teen girls and pedophiles? Justin Bieber,"Was forced to ""watch"" this crap by my GF daughter, one word HORRIBLE.As i mentioned in the title, its a dream come true for any Pedophile and pre-teen girl, but more of a poison if you consider yourself normal self respecting male of ages 18+ or female ages 21+."
4,Inspiring...,"Saw the fan cut version in theater with my two young daughters and their friends...inspiring & awesome. Really like the kid, he so real and talented. Disappointed dvd does not offer the fan cut version...too much missing. Girls and I were really looking forward to see JB pranking backstage, parking lot water fun and my favorite the scene when he reacts to Willow Smith's song (I flip my hair back & forth)!"
3,okay,"as ordered, can't say that I am a bieber fan, but my daughter likes him, so what are you going to do..."
5,MY DAUGHTER WHO IS TEN HAS SEEN THIS AT LEAST 25 TIMES!,"I bought this for my daughter, Sierra, and she watches this movie A LOT! She adores anything of Justin's including this movie which I have seen several times with her and it is a really awesome film!"
1,"Please, make it stop...",One more example of movie making gone bad... Time I will never get back. Please dont let your kids watch.
4,Another great gift from my granddaughter,"I bought this used so was expecting it to show signs of wear. The wear on the case was more pronounced than I expected based on the information in the listing. Still, it was worth the price I paid. My granddaughter was delighted with it so I'm glad I purchased it for her."
2,No extras,"Film was ok but you don't get and extras, so I'd suggest buying the dvd unless you need to watch this instant. It is a better value..."
1,JB is annoying and hes not even a real musician to begin with,this kid basically has no talent i do not know why he got his own movie but this movie is not even watchable its annoying dumb and stupid and unintelligent i listen to real music and real musicians but this movie does not even belong in the dvd section to begin you want to see or watch a real concert check out cds by megadeth metallica slayer led zeppelin ac/dc heck even guns n roses outshines this frikin disgrace of a musician if you want to watch a real musical documentary look elsewhere because you will not find quality within this product
1,crap,it's another mickey mouse club followup kid but from you tube instead of the club he'll be like lindsey lohan and cracked out in 10 years and treating him like a baby michael jackson is just pointless.
4,"A must, if you are a JB fan","This is an item you must have if you are in the music industry, a devoted fan of JB, or just interested in how some people get into the music industry in the 21st century!"
1,Never Watch Ever!,This Justin chick needs to just stop. Here's a review that will hopefully encourage her to do just that along with offsetting all of the 5-star review from 13 year old girls out there.
5,Never Say Never,I lOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOve this movie! I saw it in the theaters and I had to get the movie!!!I is my favortiest movie EVER!I LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE ITMacKenzie:)
4,"Not for everyone, but if you love Bieber, you'll love this.","While I don't think this movie is an Oscar-caliber, genius film, it is exactly what it claims to be. Justin Bieber has taken over the world with no signs of stopping any time soon. If you, or someone you know, is a Bieliber then this is perfect for them. Great ""documentary"" type film showcasing his hit ""Never Say Never"" tour. Just prepare yourself for the screaming..."
5,Great movie,"I bought it for my nieces and watched it with them and loved it! Great price, great buy! A must see movie!"
5,Linda Planner,"I ordered this for my grandson's birthday, when he received it in the mail he was so excited. I watched it at his birthday party, great gift."
5,A MUST get Video that Inspires.,"I saw the 3-D version about a year ago and have to say it was 150% entertaining and inspiring. Justin Bieber is more than a singer, but a good clean roll model for our young people.If he can stay out of the Hollywood scene he'll do just fine."
3,the habit change workbook. How to break bad habits and form good ones,So far sense i have been using the book it has been somewhat helpfull.But i still yet have got to put the techniques to full use.So i think there is still more i can get from it.
4,Great Product one small flaw,"As the title says this is a great product. It is easy to use and can be quite powerful, but the problem is if you are using anything other then Windows XP it won't even install. So if you are running Windows 2k and don't want (or can't) to upgrade to XP you may want to look elsewhere."
1,CASIO gets jiggy.....,"Well, I've been a fan,,,kinda like the toyota of watches,,,but this one looks and feels like something the navy SEALS wear and died after only 2 months of really soft wear...i haven't even scratched the face on it yet...i'm gonna try and complain, but the crybaby thing is a drag to perform....so it maybe time to look for the next cheap bulletproof watchmaker with some alarms and functions..."
2,Its early but good,"I like it and its doing well, I'm concerned about the choking hazard/ magnet hazard. What kind of watch needs that sort of warning and what sort of electronic includes magnets? i was under the assumption that those two didn't go well together. Also on the back it says MADE IN CHINA while on the buckle it says CASIO thailand, I thought CASIO was a Japanese company?? could this be a fake? on the model code they add CG after the V i assume stands for Classic G-shock but on the Casio website it doesn't include that. I recommend spending 20$ more on the real thing."
2,Make sure you have good eye sight first,"It's my fault, I should have checked one out in a store first, before buying this watch. It's a good watch, but The numbers & date are really small. I need to have on my reading glasses to be able to see the time or date. It's a pretty big watch face, I don't know why they made the numerals so small. Over all casio G-Shock watches have always been good watches for me. I just goofed up on ordering this one.Mark W."
5,Greatest watch ever!!!!,This is the best watch ive had so far it blows timex out of the water. its super durable and havent had one problem. A+++++++++ I will recommend this to anyone I know.
4,"Easy watch to use, pretty durable.",I bought this and I have owned it for about three days. It seems to be a legitimate watch. It's very durable and easy to use. There is a short beep that goes off every hour though. I haven't figured out how to turn it off yet. It is a handy notifier but it can be annoying in quiet places.
3,Watch Color,"The picture of the item is very deceiving. The color is grey in the picture and the description of the watch is black. Yes, got a black watch in the mail.Delivery time was awesome!"
4,GOOD,"I had a same model. But mine got old.This model is like mine but with some plus features.Really good, nice delivery."
5,Nice watch,Considering it was a little over thirty bucks this is a great watch. Setup was quick and easy. The watch itself is just the right size.
3,Men's G-Shock,"I bought this for myself and I wear it work to keep track of the time. Because I am a female and its a mens watch, it does fit a little big on my wrist but it works for what I need it for."
1,The last Casio I will ever buy.,Went through 2 of these in 8 months. New batteries don't help.This is simply a defective product and Amazon shouldn't be selling them.
4,very capable G-Shock,"Very versatile watch. If you are a very active athlete looking for a watch or just in need of a very ruggedized one, this is the watch for you. It has an alarm, a countdown timer, countdown alarm, stopwatch(also w/ a track/lap mode), a backlight, and more!!!! Difficult to break (perfect for those of us exposed to rough environments, for example ships) Only con is its so complex you might need to read the instructions to learn how to use it. otherwise awesome watch, especially for its price."
4,Casio Digital Watch G-Shock,"I have had several G-Shock Casios....still have most of them...with broken bands. The pieces all worked great, just can't wear them now. Replacement straps, for me, have been sub standard and ( after the first attempt and usage ) not worth the effort. I still buy them 'cause I use the light feature to briefly navigate dark areas at night and the alarm function is a backup for my beside clock. They are not too expensive and suit me to a T."
1,Died in swimming pool,It's ridiculous but it died in swimming pool. I thought I am not lucky but as I've seen in other people reviews it happened quite often with this model. I wouldn't take a chance anymore.
5,Awesome,love my watch but there is one little thing I dont like about it. the arm band is to small for my wrist. I have to place it on the first or second notch. I just wish I can find a longer band but the watch is so awesome.
5,Perfect for any location or activity,G-Shock did good with this watch. It can stand up to 120 degree weather in Africa and in Afghanistan and you clean the desert sand off by just running water on it for two seconds. G-Shock always makes good watches for active people.
4,classic,After trying Nike and Timex sport watches it was to get back to a classic Casio. And the price is right.
4,Just got it and seems to be pretty solid,Pretty much what I expected. Needed it for the Army. Still trying to figure out how to turn off the beeping noise it makes when you push the side buttons.
5,Durable & Reliable,"Great product, durable and reliable. Easy to use buttons and backlit for nighttime display if needed."
4,love it,"I love this product. I like the size, and it does look cool when I'm wearing it. If only they have the completely black color version. Would be nicer"
4,Great inexpensive dive watch,This is a very good inexppensive dive watch. The G shock version protects it and is fine . If there is a wrinkle the display is a bit small.
3,Casio Men dw9052-1v,"El reloj es muy sencillo pensaba que era otro modelo. Aunque este tipo de modelo G-shock son excelente, no lleno mis expectativas."
4,Sencillo pero práctico,"Le compré este reloj a mi hijo de 7 años, el cual le queda un poquito grande, pero es perfecto por que su caracteristica de resistencia contra los impactos y diseño simple le ha permitido adaptarse mucho mejor en sus compromisos.La principal caracteristica de su diseño es para resistir impactos, pero el display lo dejaron algo pequeño, sin embargo no es un inconveniente."
1,Get what you pay for!,"Buying a Casio G-shock is a hit and miss. I have owned a couple over the years with minimal problems. But in Aug I bought the 9052 and it suffered sudden death syndrome. So amazon was nice to swap it out. Then 3 months later moisture started to appear under the display. Amazon wouldnt take it back again so I turned to casio warranty. I mailed it in and they have denied my request and are asking for $30.00 to repair it.. WTF Called them and got no where.... BTW If I want my watch back I have to pay $8 return shipping.Can anyone reccomend anything else, since I'm boycotting Casio..."
5,Very Goof,"Very good, worth the price, real Casio,my kid is very happy with it. I always get quality products from Amazon, I trust Amazon more than any other internet shop."
5,Love it!!!!,My boyfriend love the watch!!!! It is a great product!!!!! Great present if you doesn't know what to get your boyfriend/husband!
5,Love this watch!,"Tough, durable and does everything that I need it to do. I use it mostly for swimming (timing laps, breath exercises etc.) and it works great!"
1,Died first day- won't keep time.,I usually love the plain old style G Shock but the Solar Kind is poor quality. I had it less than a day before it died. When I finally could charge it up it would not keep good time. It is impossible to set as well. I will not buy another one. My Timex has outlived this watch and it was only $30. Do not buy this Casio!
3,Watch for son for Christmas,I'm giving it to my 14 year old son for Christmas. It was shipped and arrived quickly and on schedule.
2,Casio watch,"I love the watch, except for one thing---the numbers that tell the time are way too small!! -- unfortunately I have been away and I think the time to return it has expired"
3,Numbers to small and hard to read,Its OK but the numbers are to small and to hard to read and it is to early to tell on durabity.
4,Just what I was looking for,"4 stars, doesn't get 5 cause I figure the watch has to beam me to the moon or something else crazy in order to get a 5th star.Good looking watch. Nothing extra special. Does what you need, tells time, has an alarm clock, timer, stop watch, and a glow in the dark light...If you looking for a lot more than I guess you should look else where. I needed this watch for the gym, for my workout routine, which calls for a lot of time tracking...this does the trick. If it lasts a couple years it was more than worth it, I'll be more than happy cause it wasn't expensive at all..."
1,Light stopped working after three days!,Light stopped working after three days! This is the illuminator and is supposed to be durable. I can't understand why light would stop working.
1,awful,I had to return this watch because my son did not like it. He claims it is too hard to set the time or program the alarm.
2,made in China not Thailand. possibly fake?,"Just got my watch today and realized it was made in China not Thailand as it showed in the picture. What is going on? Wanna file a complain, does anyone know how?"
1,button failure,I just received it today and It is a failure. The buttons does not work. I am returning it.
1,Out Of Stock I still havent got my money back from you people,I bought this watch from you people you said it was out of stockSo i wasn't charged anything I still haven't got my money backIf i don't see my money in 2-3 weeks my lawyer will be in touch with you
1,NEVER RECIEVED MY WATCH.,I never recieved my watch. I called USPS several times and no one is responding. I have no idea what my watch looks like. I have never seen it.
2,ok,I was excited to get this item but when I eventually did and I tested it the back light on the watch would not come on no matter what. I just decided to leave it as is. Disappointed.
1,G-Shockingly Disappointed,"Another victim of the Sudden G-Shock Death Syndrome described in other reviews here. This one just went dead after less than 6 months of normal use -- no water immersion, no banging or shocks, no falls from high buildings. I sent it to an authorized repair center, got it back seemingly repaired, but then 2 months later it was dead again. My once high confidence in Casio is shot. For everyday use I've replaced it with a $14 Timex 1440 which is nowhere near as cool-looking, but has functioned reliably for over a year. I've also owned incredibly cheap no-name digital watches for use at the gym that were more durable and lasted for years. I bought this watch based on the 4 stars average review and ignored the people reporting bad experiences -- but now realize that the 8 one-star reviews vs. 25 five-star reviews found on Amazon today really point to higher chances of dissatisfaction than a ""4 out of 5 stars"" would seem to indicate."
5,slightly smaller than expected,"I've been looking at this watch for a while now as I am an avid collector of G-shocks and I already own the DW5600E, DW6900, G2300-9V, and G-056B models. The one thing that has put me off about veiwing the pictures of this particular model was how big it looked. Don't get me wrong, I'm not opposed to larger watches as the DW6900 isn't exactly tiny, but I felt the watch should be more like the G2300-9V (which I think is perfect for my wrist). Too my surprise, when the DW9052-1V arrived and I opened the packaging I was greatful for it's downsized diameter. It's about as thick as the DW6900 but it's face width is more like the G2300-9V and DW5600E. I find this very appealing to my tastes as I don't think it needs to be so large for its basic timekeeping fuctions (chronograph, 24hr timer, alarm, afterglow). Another thing that surprised me is how the bands swing rather freely on their pivot points compared to other G-shocks. I am very pleased with this watch!"
3,Texas Toast Watch,"I just got my new DW9052-1V in the mail today. The pictures online don't do the watch any justice. I opened the package and was shocked to see such an awesome time piece for around $40. The watch is BIG, bulky & tough looking. If it were a piece of bread, it would defiantly be classified under the Texas Toast variety. Suit wearing yuppies need not apply. This thing won't fit under your button up shirt sleeve. Very happy with my purchase. Thanks Amazon!UPDATE: I've worn the watch for a day & sadly had to return it. The watch band was very uncomfortable. I have since been wearing my G Shock 6900 1V. It feels & fits much better."
3,"Simple Watch, Durable, Great Bang for the Buck","G-Shock makes great watches, I have owned 100 dollar G-Shocks to 215 dollar Pathfinders. This watch is great for the money. It is a bit bulky you could say, but it has a tough and rugged design and look to it also. Basic alarm, stopwatch, timer, and electro luminescent light."
4,a good story,I read the book in bed before I went to sleep over several nights. I was so engrossed in the story that I found myself staying up much later than usual. I also found myself looking forward to crawling into bed each evening so that I could pick up where I had left off. I felt like I got to know the characters. The story lingered after I had finished reading and put it down. My hat's off to the author.
3,Very Informative Bootleg Quality DVD,"I'll get right to the point. This DVD would be up there with Cocaine Cowboys 1-2, Mr. Untouchable, and other informative documentaries but it's mega-cheap and definitely not worth the price. It looks like something I could have bought in an alley behind a fried chicken shack for five bucks or less. There's no menu or chapters. It just begins abruptly and ends the same way. It feels like it was recorded from a cable tv show. On the other hand, I was shocked, amazed, and thrilled by Pablo's rise and fall. I just wish I would have bought my copy on the street."
4,"Great information, yet there's always two sides of a story.","Great information from one side, what about the other side? We will never know. As like the others said, horrible quality for DVD content. No chapters, just straight into it."
5,Great pan,I have made 3 bundt cakes and one flan in this so far and nothing has even come close to sticking.Cake comes out very clean and easily.
3,Too little depth. Read the Steve Squyres book instead.,"I liked the video because it contains real footage of the actual events that transpired when the rovers landed, but it's way too short and in too little depth. If it had been longer, then maybe it would have been good.For anyone who has followed the MER mission or watched the webcasts on NASA tv, there is way too little that is new in this DVD. I recommend instead to read the Steve Squyres book, Roving Mars which is well written and details the MER project and the history leading up to this mission."
4,Walk on another world,"The twin cameras mounted on the mast of the Mars rovers are spaced about the same distance as human eyes, and the same height as a person standing on the sandy desert. In this strange and alien place, you can walk in the wheel tracks of the first mobile explorers ever to venture onto the surface of another planet -- where every photo could contain a fossil or rock layer that holds the secrets of another planet's history. The engineering and scientific effort to achieve this is one of the greatest feats of our civilization, and surely one of the greatest thrills for anyone who has ever wondered about other worlds. Both rovers are still exploring, and new photos arrive every day. Personally, I can think of nothing more pleasant to enjoy with my morning coffee than a survey of the cold, hostile images of Mars -- free for anybody with an internet connection. Poet or engineer -- don't miss a chance to see your first up-close view of the red planet! -- Auralgo"
4,NOVA: Welcome To Mars (2005) - Very good film by NOVA,"NOVA: Welcome To Mars (2005)was a four star film by NOVA and is recommended for all fans of planetary science and NASA. This film should be watched serially after watching Mars, Dead or Alive as it continues where that film leaves off providing excellent documentation of the mars rover missions once they ""landed"" and started their exploration of the Martian surface.Welcome to Mars documents ""proof"" of the existance of free standing water on the early surface of Mars. It also documents how scientists and engineers work together to change a dream into hardware and reality, while providing useful scientific and cost effective data.My hat is off to this new generation of government workers at NASA and their great efforts to explore Mars and prepare the way for manned expeditions sometime in the future."
1,a little pre-mature ?,"Whilst writing this in September of 2005, I read reports of spectacular feats by the Mars rovers, climbing to unpresidented mountain heights and beaming back the most awesome panoramic veiws ever seen of Mars. I therefore cannot help thinking, why was this dvd released before the mission is complete, so as to include all this fantastic film from Mars ? Would it not have been more prudent to wait, and have the pick of Mars footage, or will there just be a 'directors cut' later ? I think I'll wait for the missions' conclusion before rushing out to buy a 'Mars rover' dvd."
3,Exactly average - what is the point?,"I don't know, what is the point of all those ""great"" and ""best"". Neutron Star is an average short story, without even approximately interesting ideas. May be I should read all his ""Known Space""? I didn't like it, sorry, and I doubt I'll like others."
4,A very good collection of stories,"Niven expands his Known Universe in this collection of stories and provides background details and hints for books that he wrote later, often tieing in eariler works with later exansions of his world.In this collection of short storied, probably the best one is Neutron Star. I still remember the fear that held me when the gravitational forces started pulling the heroes apart. Invisible hands tearing bodies and limbs in a scifi story was very frightening for me, at least till the heroes discovered the causes. I remember this vividly, though a I read this quite some time ago.Soft Weapon is a perhahs the least of my favorite stories, mainly because I felt it was too drawn out."
4,great collection of short SF stories,"I'm not as well acquainted with Niven's work as these other reviewers, but I wanted to chime in here to say how great this book is. The stories are short enough to read in one sitting, which is the definition of a 'short' story, but many collections like this include longer texts that are hard to knock out before you fall asleep at night. Although it appears to be out of print, this book is readily available at many used book sellers."
4,Santa Duties Fullfilled!,"Suit is velour with a ""silky"" lining that shows out at the sleeves. The belt will tear if you are not careful at the holes for the buckle. The zippered jacket helps to get cooled down once in a while on a break."
4,Overall a good costume,"Pants, hat and jacket are great! It's awesome it came with a white hair wig too! The belt was way too large but what do you expect? I'm sure it was made for larger people. The only problems I had(not big problems either) is that the straps underneath the boot tops snapped but a little tape can fix that. The beard has two elastic bands that go around the ears so it all depends and the size of your ears and shape of your face. If you're good with sewing you can make the adjustments or just stick some tape on the inside of the beard to your face. The other thing is the belt. You can easily make another hole to fit the belt to your liking. Other than that the costume is great!!"
3,A Bit Lazy,"Strenger's book basically says that old psychoanalysis is bad because it is infected by modernism, and new psychoanalysis is good, because it is pomo, all about shifting identities and co-constructed realities.Hmmm. I wish Strenger had written a more rigorous book. His blithe dismissals of Kleinians -- implying that science refutes their theories, without offering evidence -- confuses, especially as two of his heroes, Stephen Mitchell and Nancy Chodorow, have found much to admire in Kleinian ideas.Strenger seems to want to dip in and out of different theories, without theorizing the theory that guides him -- or doesn't. That said, there are a few wonderful case vignettes here, as well as a lucid contrast of Michael Eigen and Adam Phillips. Still, for the radical project Strenger is undertaking, a much more thorough book is required. I believe the mildness of the back-cover blurbs reveals that his colleagues feel the same."
2,Informative yet unimpressive,"Although this book is packed with a variety of useful information, the main feeling one gets after reading it is that the author does everything in her power to discourage her reader from embarking on the path of Zen. The fact that the author had spent a better part of her life writing technical manuals undoubtedly affected her present writing style. The result of her recent creative labors is a dry and unexciting manual from the person who, arguably, never reached the enlightenment (awakening) herself. In a way, one can see this book as a way to justify the author's failure to discover her own True Self."
4,More great characters,"Callanan has again created some wonderful characters with very interesting stories to tell. I especially love his Catholic priests who are a terrific mixture of the divine and the world they have lived in (or through). While I laughed out loud many times, the story is absolutely wrenching. Read Cloud Atlas too."
1,A good second book.,"The Author had previously written an unusal well-crafted novel, The Cloud Atlas. He follows this up whith All Saints equally well-written and intriguing. I marveled at how a young man could portray a 50 year old woman with such depth and compassion and make you believe that she was speaking. I look forward to future books by this author,I intended a rating of Four stars and don't know how it wound up as only one. I haven't been able to correct the rating."
5,Sanchia's Secret by Robyn Donald (Large Print Harlequin),"Description from the book back cover:Taboo! It had been three years since Sanchia Smith had last laid eyes on his rangy, sexy body. His powerful Greek ancestry apparent in all its glory, Caid Hunter's compelling aura still had the ability to steal her breath away. Yet Caid's reaction to her now was one of steely control - born of Sanchia's earlier flight and inability to unleash the passion she felt for him. She knew that this time there would be no escape. Caid would erode her defences until he had unlocked the fearful secret that held the key to Sanchia's heart!"
5,What can I say ...,... a classic that is not sold in the US by stores any more. I have been wearing this for years and my wife loves the great clean but subtle smell that never overwhelms.
1,Terribly shallow,"This book is terrible. I think whoever wrote the book jacket copy was doing James St. James a terrific favor. I wasn't even mildly amused. And for such a gruesome and terrible murder JSJ certainly doesn't seem capable of writing of it with anything apporaching intelligence, compassion, or even real understanding. JSJ struggles to keep Alig's actions as the subject when all he wants to do is focus on himself and since he's not that interesting or funny the book doesn't work on any level. And the use of different type settings is just an attempt to make the book seem more interesting or rule breaking than it is."
1,BORING !,"I think ALIG is the man to write the story of that period...St.James's insecurity,low self esteem and self_pity (all over the book--- unintentionally i bet) gets tired after a while..I was expecting much better...ok reading during lunch breaks but nothing ""timeless"". Again, cannot wait for Alig's book !"
2,sawed off,I never got into books or movies that attempt to define the drug experience. I've yet to feel it through images or words.Party monster is another casualty.The book offers little insight on Angel Melandez. If here weren't included in the narrative I'd of barely missed him.The book is about James St. James.Big deal. His story isn't all that interesting.
2,Back In The Day...,"I haen't read the book yet, but I met James St. James, Alig, Keoki, Julie Jewels, Bella Bolski, The It Twins and others back in 1988 and 1989. I was only 17 back then. My friends and I partied at the The World, Red Zone, Mars and numerous outlaw and after hour parties. Drugs were never in short supply. By the time Michael got really big, I'd foregone that clubkid scene for more docile (!!) hiphop shindigs.Can't wait to read the book and see the movie."
5,do not miss this title!,"Having seen the movie first(and loving it!)the book by James St.James is a near revelation!Witty and insightful,this book has become my new best friend.I read this book from cover to cover the day i bought it and i have re-read it at least 10 times!With a writing style this fluid and telling,it BEGS a visit!Any book that starts off wit instructions on how to prepare an illicit drug is worth it!"
4,Just FAB,"I am a almost 30 year old accountant with a sensible car and a mortgage and this book made me want to chuck it all, go to NYC and dress up like a club kid, and do things that would SHOCK my friends.Oh and the story was quite catchy also. James St. James is so witty ! I can't tell you how many times I grabbed my husband and said ""here read this it is just HYSTERICAL"".Well much to his delight I finished the book in around 24 hours and that included work and sleep !Just a good little read - go and get yourself a copy !"
4,An adventure,"I had no idea what world I was about to enter when I started this adventure with James St. James. His use of storytelling is absolutly fabulous, at times I felt like I was right there in NYC with the rest of the club kids. Prior to reading this book I knew nothing of the New York City club life St. James writes about, but his story of Michael Alig doesn't just tell of the murder of Angel Melendez, but instead tells you of their lives, and lifestyles. I was absolutly amazed, and couldn't put the story down. A must read, but may be only for the open-minded."
1,"Slim, dreary, and self-important...","I should have known I was in for a disappointment when Disco Bloodbath wound up so quickly on my used bookstore's shelf. But, knowing some of the people in the scene in those days, I thought I'd give it a try. Lordy, what a mess this book is. St. James has all the insight and self-knowledge of a Right-Wing Bible-belter. His self-importance and shallow worldview wouldn't matter so much if he was actually funny, but he gives us the same tired drag queen jokes and movie quotes I've been hearing since the 70's. The Alig story is one ripe for a good book, but honey, this isn't it. I paid half price for this thing, and still feel my money and time was wasted."
1,Too bad there isn't a Zero Star rating.,"I regret that I wasted my time reading this book. Having lived in NY during this time period, I thought the book would be an interesting read. Instead, it's a self-indulgent K-trip by a self-absorbed drug addict. It's badly written -- I imagine the book was published just because of the subject matter, which, unfortunately, it offers no insights on."
1,Distasteful,I found this book to be horrible and dreary. Was he on Ketamine while he wrote it? Who were these jerks and why would anyone want to read about them? I tried to finish it but decided to have a root canal without anesthesia for fun instead.
1,Hated it,I found the author was more interested in letting you know who James St. James was rather then Michael Alig. I guess I just like more of a straightforward read but I found this book to be vapid and really not all that shocking. The sarcastic tone of the book gets pretty old after awhile too.
5,"Equally hilarious, fabulous, and tragic...","Party Monster was a book that I absolutely could not put down. I admit, it may not be for everyone. But, if you enjoy TRUE tales of awful hilarity involving drug use/abuse and clubbing, this is a must read... I laughed out loud and wanted to cry at the same time in certain chapters. As far as I'm concerned, James St. James' book should be read in universties everywhere."
4,very good book,"I enjoyed this book, and movie... its a true story. It took you on a whirlwind adventure of drugs, sex, and partying the nights away... along with murder."
2,"Not a murder mystery, just stories of drug use-tired!","I thought this book would be a story of a scene in New York, as well a as gripping tale of murder. The first part of it was interesting, but as time wore on, all this book was about was the author's drug use. In short,it got real tired, really fast."
3,"Quirky, Funny, Perverse","This is a cute little read. Almost gives off the impression of a sick and twisted fable. However, James keeps it light (almost too light) and yet for some reason I enjoy his off-beat humour. A cute little read about a sad reminder of the sickness instilled in some people, amplified by the effects of drugs and alcohol."
4,From L.A. with LOVE,"I was there. Alig was soo mean to me, because I was from L.A. I'm really not surprised that she killed someone, when I saw her mother at the Limelight party I knew she was craked. James' account of the whole scene is chillingly accurate, James if you remember me it's tall William, whoever had anything to do with any part of the ""culture"" will identify on soo many levels.All I have to say to James st James is BRAVO HONEY BRAVO!!"
5,Simply adorable,"This was the perfect accessory to my cousin's prom dress, and the service/packaging was quick and neat!"
3,Good game but hard,This is a good turn-based strat game but plan on doing some grinding or you won't survive. I think it's going to be a good game but I haven't gotten very far into it. The graphics are good.
4,Not sturdy enough for industrial use,"What other reviewers say is true - good product - but, unlike theMakita ML120 12-Volt Pivoting Head Flashlight(which we ended up buying & are happy with), it does not stand up to heavy use/abuse. The problem is almost always the FL lamp (it's internally damaged by a hit) and not the light itself, so that's a positive."
1,toooo expensive,would like to know what makes this product so special that costs more than 4 times the original price of $9.99 at just about any cd store or the company itself?
1,Ouch!,I wanted to love this video but unfortunately all of the videos in this series are so very boring! My high school students were so disappointed. The videos are informative but not in a way that would cause excitement or interest in the classroom. I was ready to turn it off within the first 15 minutes.
5,No need to fear Biblical interpretation if you own this book,"Doriani has assembled this book with great concern for those who have not had formal Seminary or Bible college training, but who have a strong desire to be involved in the teaching ministry at the local church. I believe--as a formally trained Biblical interpreter--that this book needs to to be in the hands of all those in this category, as well as in the hands of those formally trained! Doriani has carefully communicated all the important ""steps"" of Biblical interpretation in a manner that is understandable and clear for lay men and women. Don't know Hebrew or Greek but desire to teach the Bible correctly? Buy this book now."
4,Enjoyable,"We originally bought this CD because it has the ""Parade of the Wooden Soldiers"" song. My kids really enjoy this CD. It is fun and has a nice variety of songs. The music is pleasant to the ear."
2,Not sure what I was expecting...but it wasn't this,"I bought this CD because I was going to be teaching a preschool ballet class. There were very few usable songs on the disc. They sounded too, well, classical - not ""kid"" enough for me. Maybe I just had the wrong idea when I bought it, I don't know!"
5,Great book for Guys,"As a middle aged man going through what we middle aged men go through, I found this book very informative, helpful, and insightful. In just about each relationship Mr. French covers there are issues these men faced which resonate with my own struggles in relationship. Since men rarely share there true feelings in this area, this book help me to understand that others have the same struggles I do and reveals insights into directions for solutions. I found the author's commentary helpful as well.Great book- all men should read it!! CC"
2,Will provoke lots of women assuming they have found all the answers.,"I've had lots of women over the years ask me to interpret other guys behavior, and I've steered them towards some books I've read that could help them to understand us. This isn't one of those books. It does provide a look into a FEW men's thoughts; the dangerous thing is, reading this book will most likely cause the women who read it to think they now understand every man's behavior, and that is oh, so incorrect, and can cause as many or more problems as it solves. It was interesting, but take what you learn with a grain of salt, because you're only seeing the tip of the iceberg here. You'll need to do much more research to understand all the possible reasons your mate might fall out of love with you."
4,Looks good,"Gravel looks great in my tank. I would have given it five stars but, I had to clean the gravel many times to clear up the water. Not a big deal but more cleaning them im used to with other gravel,"
4,Innovative crochet technique from a knitting expert,"Lily Chin's clothing designs & columns are widely reprinted in advanced knitting magazines. This book does not just present attractive afghans with easily accessible yarns. In addition, Ms. Chin promotes a new crochet technique for the (usually) more conservative yarn craft. She shows a new technique need not be hard to master to be worthwhile.Most of the designs in this book are afghans, but a few bonus clothing directions are included. This book should have everyone, knitters included, crocheting! (The crochet CLOTHING book will get a 5 star rating.)"
3,Long Double Crochet should be illustrated,"This is a very good book for creating some really lovely afghans. However, the technique is based on two basic stitches that are completely glossed over. 1 - the sc used to give the pieces a mosaic look and feel are barely mentioned in the patterns. Without the consistency of the sc odd numbered rows you would get a totally different outcome. 2 - the basis for everything else is the LDC stitch. Unfortunately there is no illustration of the long double crochet stitch in the stitches at the end of the book. The stitches illustrated are reprints of the basic crochet stitches found in all crochet books. Time should have been taken to create an illustration of the stitch that the technique is centered around - LDC."
1,Some good ideas with the wrong treatment,"Overripe drama about a kidnapping and a Southern family's dirty secrets. The film's story is set in the present, however it plays like something out of the 40s or 50s. The hammy acting and stagy dialogue only add to this effect, which according to the director was intentional, but it just doesn't work. The transfer is marginal, the picture is very fuzzy, and it's in pan & scan format, making the obviously widescreen shots (in the super 16 format) look claustrophobic."
4,"""Old-School"" Indie",This is a raw film that will take you on an intense journey. This movie is what Indie Film making is all about. FYR
4,Southern Man delivers,"What got me most about SOUTHERN MAN is it doesn't hit you over the head with a message. What it does hit you with is it's quiet intensity. The performances are top rate, and in this era of over blown production value, it's nice to see a film that is both story and character driven. Let's see more films like SOUTHERN MAN. Better yet, let's see more films by the talented, Rick Rosenberg."
5,One of the few films these days with something to say.,"This movie kicks butt. It grabbed me right away and pulled me all the way through. Great suspense and mystery but with an independent feel. At first it appears to be your normal kidnapping film, but as it goes on you realize there's something else going on. Something deeper. I heard through the indy grapevine, the guy did the whole thing for like $150K or something. Pretty amazing feat if you compare it with your average $20 - $50 million film. The distributor says it'll be available for rent soon, too. If you're looking for good entertainment AND art, check this out!"
2,"It's okay, but....","...Kennedy's love for the capitol of New York is more heartfelt in all of his great fiction than in this somewhat turgid history. When you stack it next to such books as IRONWEED, VERY OLD BONES and THE FLAMING CORSAGE, O ALBANY reads rather dry by comparison, something Kennedy at his best seldom is."
4,Ambercrombie in an eclectic mode,"One of the better jazz albums I've heard this year, superior to his last release, November (At least this is the last release of his I bought.) Using Kenny Wheeler on trumpet and Mark Feldman on violin, Abercrombie holds back on his guitar playing to create an ensemble sound. Excellent!"
3,Some inspiring moments but not enough overall interest,"As is usual with Mr Abercombie, there is one track in the programme which is devoted to free improvisation. The remaining eight are works composed by the leader. Of these, some are desultory and wandering (eg, Just in Tune and Speak Easy) but the title track is intriguing and exciting with a stunning solo by Mr Feldman on violin (backed by the brilliant Mr Nussbaum).Gimme Five shows Mr Abercombie at his swinging best. Overall, too few jewels on what gives every impression of being a relaxed afternoon gig."
4,Waiting for Snow in Havana,"An insight into the mind of one who, as a youth, experienced the loss of Cuban homeland and years of separation from their natural parents. Recommended to me by one of my several Florida friends who lived the experience of being relocated to the the U.S. through operation Peter Pan. A well written mixture of humor, emotion and history which is relevant today as the U.S.-Cuban relationship continues to be examined."
5,Incredible...,"A moving, incredible, passionate and wonderfully written book. Written in a way that helps you see and feel what the author saw and felt - incredible talent! I went with a Cuban guy for 15 years; he was born in the US but his parents had not been, so this book was especially moving to me. I did not know alot of this history - some which i should have, some which i wouldnt have been expected to. I would tell anyone who knows a Cuban person, who is interested in Cuba, or who would just love to read a wonderful book to please - read this book."
3,"Slow reading, disjointed stories","I heard about this book on a morning talk radio show and thought the author sounded very sincere and his story very interesting. It is an interesting story and I'm sure the author tells it how he lived it but unfortunately I found it to be just OK. Normally I can fly thru a book...Kite Runner for example, however this is definitely not on the same scale."
2,Not what I remember of Cuba,"While I have read a few books on Cuba, this one seemed to have great reviews, and I was disappointed as what I read is not at all what I remember of my life on the island. Even having left at age 15, a lot of what is mentioned on this book most probably had to do with a well to do family.Nothing wrong with that, except, that is not what the majority of the kids that left were. Most of us came from the so called middle class, which is why I decided to write this review."
2,Still Angry After all These Years,"Overall, I was disappointed by this book. I had hoped for more insight about what life was like in Cuba before the revolution. But, because the author was only around 10 years old at the time, much of his recollections could be those of a roudy child anywhere. The author has a lot of anger about the revolution and several small indignities, which he vents repeatedly throughout the book. It was interesting to get a glimpse of what happened to the middle class in Cuba and the plight of the refugees in America after the revolution, but I would have liked to know more about that and less about how much fun it was to blow up firecrackers and throw ripe fruit at other children."
4,Poetry in Motion,"It's difficult to write well in one's mother tongue, rarer still to be a poet in one's adopted language. So I marvel at the prose of Carlos Eire, a Cuban-born immigrant who came to the U.S. at the age of 12. ""Waiting"" is Carlos' memoir of his years in Cuba and encompasses the ""Revolution,"" during which Fidel and Che came into power. Carlos offers a fascinating look at Cuban culture and history while documenting his personal experiences -- some tragic -- as a young boy. I thoroughly enjoyed his story."
5,Incredibly moving,Incredibly moving account of 1950's and '60's Cuba through the eyes of an 8-11 yr.-old. Told with humor and wonderful descriptions of Cuba and the motley crew of family characters. The author artfully weaves in the influences of his Catholic upbringing.
3,Strange book,"Read it a while ago, and can't remember why I disliked it. It did give an idea of the times of the takeover of Cuba by Castro, from a child's point of view, but very strange!"
5,What a story,I guess if you want to write a memoir it helps to have an interesting life and this man certainly has. There are so many quirky characters that this book reads like a novel. I loved it.
2,I was really excited about this book...,"...because it was unique: a man writing about his experience as a boy in Cuban Revolutionary times. I have an interest in the history and culture of Cuba, and have made some great friends there....couldn't wait to read this book.The author's style is great for evoking the feel and emotion of his childhood; his anecdotes are by turns amusing and sad. The problem for me: his very regular, spontaneous breaks into anti-Fidel diatribe. I understand the sentiment, and the part it undoubtedly plays in his story...but the intermittent essays in oddly flowery language were a distraction and disappointment. I hope one day someone will tell their story in a way that doesn't read like semi-poetic propaganda."
2,Crocodile Tears in Havana,"This is a misty-eyed memoir of an egoistical man who had a very privileged childhood. Because that idealized world was sundered, he believes he has a deeper take on suffering and displacement and he asks the reader to sympathize with his plight and along the way, to blame it all on Castro. The writing is precious, almost cloyingly so--one would expect a historian to be more careful of his language. If the Cuba he remembers is a paradise lost, then he needs to move on. Cuba has survived well enough without him."
3,Waiting for Snow in Havana,"Good story but I just could not get into the way this writer writes. He keeps going from his childhood to what he is presently doing as an adult, which to me had no connection. Though the writer must have thought he was holding the readers attention, it did not work for me."
3,"Lots of hype, but still a pretty good read","Wonderful delivery of characters throughout the book, but Eire's relentless weaving of timelines was distracting. It was almost incoherent or redundant at times, rambling from one period to another. I also had a little difficulty understanding the ""wistful"" invocation of philosophical and spiritual jargon throughout the book.Despite the distractions, a good read for the first few hundred pages. Probably could have dropped a hundred easily."
3,Beautiful writing but slow moving plot,"This book was highly recommended to me; and i was looking forward to the read. Although the writing is exquisite, I couldn't sink into it. The plot was too slow for me and just didn't grab me. I am half way through and will not finish."
5,My childhood years,"I was born in Cuba and lived in Havana from age seven until I was twenty. Then I left for the US. Unfortunately, photos of my youth were left behind, thus lost forever. Good reason to have read Carlos Eire's book twice and savor every single page in the process. ""Waiting for Snow in Havana"" replicates my childhood years to the point where I would read it again and again, and never get tired.Andre J. RodriguezAward-winning author: ""Adios, Havana,"" a Memoir."
3,Ok but not my favorite,"I think that the book offers a lot of insight to the life of a Cuban boy and the struggles and hardships that he faced. It was well written, but dragged in many parts. Parts made me laugh others made me cry. Overall, I liked the book, it had a good message, but I would say that the overall pace of the book is slow so it takes a while to get through."
4,Waiting for Snow in Havana,A rambling but well-written book. It led to a stimulating discussion in our book club.
5,TeleVue,I've absolutely love this eyepiece. Sharp with excellent contrast. I've had this eyepiece for about a year and everyone that has looked through it have commented on how great the views. Pricey.... yes but worth it.
3,"Great Virtuosity, but For the Music, Get Kempe!","This issue will appeal to those who find in Richard Strauss a great orchestrator. But if you pass this by and get the Kempe recordings on EMI with the Staatskapelle Dresden, you will find Strauss the Great Composer."
3,This is not by Joe Cuba,"This is not an album by Joe Cuba. I don't know what's in the CD because the shipment I received contained yet another CD by a different artist - so I have no assessment of its contents. I recall seeing one review elsewhere saying that it has good Cuban percussion. The song titles and artists are as follows.1. El son de la madrugada - Son 142. Reflexiones mias - Adalverto Alvarez y su son3. La Expresiva - N. G. La Banda4. Quinto Llamando - Carlos Embale5. Sazonando - Conjunto Chappotin y sus estrellas6. Sabroso que bien me siento - Carlos Embale7. Que le pasa a esa mujer - Sierra maestra8. Lagrimas negras - Conjunto rumbavana9. Estoy seco y quiero mojar - Conjunto los bocuous10. Compay gato - Conjunto los magnificos11. Yo como candela - Adalberto Alvarez y su son12. Llego el dulcerito - Sierra maestra13. Las jardineras - Pello el afrocan14. Mamita, la jardinera - Pello el afrocan"
3,Lightning Strikes Hard,"It is a great compilation of Diamond Head songs, but as far as the music quality goes, it was a little disappointing. Am I Evil? is probably the best song of the bunch."
4,Authentic mexican Flavor,"This seasoning has a spicy, yet slightly sweet (from the dried raisins)flavor.If you want something authentic tasting, you will love this!"
2,Not the best,I guess I like a more common taco seasoning taste. This one doesn't get it for me but I like their other products.
5,More Information,This is written by the leader in the field (no longer on earth) you can never go wrong with this author.
3,sad letter and sad movie too,"from the director who brought you THE HOST, MEMORIES OF MURDER is based on a true story of south korea most nortorius serial killer. women are murdered and a killer might be sending postcards to a radio station to alert police of upcoming murders, the song SAD LETTER is played during rainstorms(why either are connected are never fully explained). slow but involving with some strained attempt at humor. the pace of the film just feels ackward better editing/tightening would have helped. overall, a lackluster yarn based on real events. I enjoy foreign films and the dubbing is usually fine--the movies dubbing is nicely done but I think it looses translation. I think this film would have been better viewed if subtitles are on. ultimately unsatisfying ending but easily forgettable too. kind of mixed bag for me. 2.5 stars actually."
3,So So,"This is a South Korean film about a murder rapist that is loose on the country side. Most notable is how corrupt and incompetant the cops are portrayed.Never caught him, always remembered the chase.So what?"
3,Strong 3+ Stars,"A good movie based on a series of murders committed in Korea in 1986. Good acting by the cast. This film and a few other recent ones shows that South Korean film-makers are appealing to broader international audiences. Has humor, suspense, action, and tragedy. Portrayal of police brutality of suspects might offend some viewers, but it's consistent with the known tactics that were practiced and tolerated at that time by Korean law enforcement. 3+ stars. Don't miss this one."
1,One of the worst mysteries I've seen,"I watched this film because it got an outstanding review on public radio's Fresh Air. The critic said it was one of the best mysteries in years. I would say it was one of the worst I've ever seen. The portrayal of the police and murder case was unrealistic and unsophisticated. The clues were simplistic and uninteresting. Worst of all, it was not entertaining. I found it hard to sit through this lackluster movie"
5,An intriguing story that is visually stunning,"In 1986, the bodies of brutalized women begin to surface in a small provincial town in South Korea. The detectives are unprepared for such crimes and their primitive methods only prolong the case, making all the wrong moves until a detective from Seoul comes to assist them in their search for what appears to be a serial killer. Years of searching finds only patterns and clues, but no killer. As the case evolves, so do the detectives: they realize the error of their ways, band together, and personally disintegrate in this harrowing case.The cinematography is stunning, with countless shots of the beautiful environment. Even the factory images are inspiring! Based on a true story, this film has a gruesome, but compelling plot that is well written and expertly acted. A sad story that is told so beautifully and painfully, it should not be missed. Highly recommended."
3,Only choice available,"This was the only hockey animation that I could find when I searched for a replacement for our older model. Although they look almost identical, this Dept. 56 version is smaller and entirely plastic (except for the hockey players.) An AC adapter must be purchased separately. It's cute enough--I just think it's rather pricey."
2,Informative video,"Interesting information about ghost towns. However, the video I received seemed to be defective (it was a library discard) and was very hard to watch without getting dizzy. Tracking did not improve matters. Oh well, it only cost a few bucks."
5,WONDERFUL,"QUAILITY WAS EXCELLENT, iHAVE ALREADY ORDRED IT FOT SOME FRIENDS. WE LIVE WHERE THE MOVIE WAS FILMED; THAT WAS REALLY INTERESTING."
5,Great!!!!,This movie was a great add to my collection which now I have turned my friends on to it and plus even though it is a VHS it still was in good condition.
5,Great product,"The teapot's teapot. Ancient Asian influence, French enameled ironware into an impressive la theiere d'art."
4,The Saints of God's Country,"This is fine and grand story of family, respect, growing up and love.Very well written, beautiful scenery described and families so regular and usual that you can picture them as your own.I will look for more books by Edward Craner."
4,Excellent investment,"If you are serious about the corrections exam, then this is the book for you. It covers all areas of the exam, including math, codes, sentence structure, and there is even a section to help prepare you for the physical part of the exam as well. This book will, however, OVERprepare you, which is a GOOD thing. It is far better to be over prepared then not know what you are doing."
2,Not Impressed,"The way this works: A rigid curved upright section is monuted on a clamp base; the upright rotates 360 degrees. A flexible metal tubing section continues to a universal joint. The flexible section twists about 90 degrees in either direction. The mounting plate has slots for screws to mount the monitor.I found one of the universal joints is too tight, the other was too loose; they could probably be adjusted. The flexible section is quite stiff. Vertical adjustment is minimal and I was concerned that I would break the monitor case when I repositioned the monitor. I bought this because I have 2 positions I routinely have to change between. I've decided to return it; I purchased an Ergotron Neo-Flex NF08LD1S (Mfr. Part #: 45-185-194) which cost $10 less and is easier to work with. I'm using a viewsonic 20.1"" widescreen monitor and I'm happy with it so far."
4,"Great deal, but order an extra set","I ordered 2 dozen of these hinges and as others have mentioned it came with the necessary screws. I did find that I was short a few of the noise dampening pads that go on the door, but that wasn't a big deal for me as I just left them off the cabinets above the refrigerator. I did notice that even though the hinges were individually wrapped in tissue paper, most of them had marks or scratches that made them slightly imperfect, but since most of the hinge is hidden no one will notice this but me. My biggest complaint was that 2 of the 24 hinges were bent, luckily I thought ahead and ordered an extra set in case of something like this. To me it was the equivalent of picking out 24 hinges without inspecting them from the bin of my local home improvent store, so I wasn't too disappointed, and even ordering an extra set I still saved a fair bit of money."
2,La Antorcha Encendida,I did not have the chance to watch this great production when it was telecasted. I could had never imagine that Televisa would have done something like this....an unfinished series...it is a shame that they did not finish the work.What is even worst is that they have the courage to sell it. Maybe Amazon should protect the customers and don't have it available for sell or have a disclamour that let people like me know that this novela has an inconclusive ending.
1,not the best,Televisa is at it again. This soap opera was cut a bit too much. The story line has no continuity. Needles to say I'm very disappointed with this product.
1,Are yoy kidding,"Amazon should take this off their list of products. See other reviews. I wish I had read the reviews prior to purchasing. The complete ending is missing. Give me a break. Everyone's money should be returned. But, we know that wont happen. 00000 stars."
3,Dissapointing,"This was more of a soap opera, music was annoying, I expected more of history related information, but was dissappointed."
2,la antorcha encendida,que triste que televisa tenga esta clase de novelas en las q hay tantos actores tan maravillosos y preparados pero q al final una novela de esta calidad quede inconclusa una verguenza de verdad ojala pudiera recuperar mi dinero no vale la pena ver algo asi si al final de invertir horas viendola y aprendiendo de nuestra historia no se concluye el tema no volvere a ordenar nada de novelas producidas por televisa porqueria.
3,Hearing Impaired,"I watched most of the 1st DVD and was disappointed with the audio mixing. Everytime the music or loud sound effects came in, the speaking was impossible to hear. My wife said this problem seem to be corrected in subsequent dvd's."
4,"O,K, however ,,,","Nice novela, however it apppears that it has been chopped downto fit into 24 hours or so.I must say that I DID NOT BUY my set from AMAZON.One big problem with my set is that the final disk #4 endswithout the END, Even though I get the drift of how independenceis achieved, I never get to see what happens to the 2 MOST DESPICABLE characters in this novela PEDRO and LUIS.I wonder if other people who have this DVD set have the same probledm, Also the actress CHRISTIAN BACH, who is widely advertised, onlly appears for about 5 minutes out of 24 hours.Again a nice novela, but with my set, NO ENDING."
2,Same ending like 11 years ago,"I saw this excellent novel in channel 41 (NY) many years ago,we were very interesting in saw it every night,but guess what? it finish without any warning, we were very disappointed because the tv channel never explain why they cut that novel in that way, last year i found this DVD set ""La Antorcha Encendida"" in Amazon and i order it very happy, because i assume we was going to see the end of this novel after many years, but the last DVD finish in the same manner than years ago, without any End!!!.Maybe Televisa lost raiting when they do this master piece or were out of money, but the reality is they NEVER finish ""La Antorcha Encendida"" ,what a shame.that is my personal opinion."
1,Lacks ending,Stay away until amazon eventually can get ahold of a new version. It actually lacks the ending!!!
1,La Antorcha Encendida,"Warning!!! This novella develops wonderful characters and a very interesting story the acting is great, the customs and sound tract are all outstanding but then all of the sudden it ends without closing the story. My wife and I were so disappointed - we thought we were missing the last disc or maybe there was a 2nd part. It was a total disappointment. Don't get suckered into watching this because it has a whole part of the story towards the end that seems to be missing - I can't believe they ended this novella like this - maybe the just left out the ending because they could not fit it all on the disc (?)"
5,Fire Bun Dem!,"Aaliyah you are the greatest.My favourite song is ""Are you that somebody,"" you have inspired me a grat deal and have encouraged me to persue my goal in singing. I LOVE YOU..."
5,I LOVE THIS SONG.,I LISTEN TO THIS ALL THE TIME. ITS A SAD SONG TO ME THOUGH. I CANT BELIEVE SHES REALLY DEAD. THIS IS ONE OF HER GOOD SONG SHE RECORDED.IF U HAVENT HEARD THIS CD THEN I DONT KNOW WHAT U WERE THINKING. THERE IS REALLY NO USE FOR U NOT TO OF HEARD THIS SONG. I THINK SHE DID A REALLY GOOD JOB AON THIS SONG AND IM FEELING THE VIDEO. IF U DONT HAVE IT THEN U SHOULD GO AND GET IT.
1,Too Many Ads,"The magazine has ads on almost every page. Short articles are sandwiched between ads! The articles usually end up being ads themselves, suggesting specific products to buy. The stories on celebrities and their children don't help me much either. I think they know their magazine has problems since they do not allow cancellation or refunds. I plan to use the issues for crafts that call for cutting up magazines."
2,Maximum Style But Minimum Quality,"Chrome wire shelving is all the rage. We bought this handy-sized Seville unit, which easily fits on a countertop, at Target. While it is advertised especially for kitchens and baths, it rusted within only 6 months when used it as a free-standing toilet paper/towel shelf, merely from steam. The decorative rails also hang upside-down, the opposite from most shelves of this type, and the resulting low rods don't prevent objects from sliding off as well as intended. We bought another wire-shelving unit made by Whitmore around the same time, a rolling cart for the laundry rm, and it is still rust-free, though frequently wet. All brands need to be measured carefully to assemble the shelves levelly, as they fit very tightly in the plastic mounting sleeves. A rubber mallet is required to gently loosen them."
1,Too Small for any Practical Use,Product can be used as like a kitchen spice rack.... but is too small to be used as a self standing shelf. Read dimensions carefully
5,Litterally 1/2 the price.,"I had purchased one of these from a local store at twice the price. I saw these, and they were the exact item as I purchased. I returned the one I bought locally and puchased this one. These are strong and very durable shelves. I highly reccomend them if you need extra space to organize any room in the house. I will be purchasing more of these in the future."
4,Smaller than expected,"This rack is smaller than expected, but fits well on top of a mini fridge, for a dorm room. Good for holding plates, mugs, and food."
5,"ANOTHER 5-STAR Review - Great Sturdy, Compact Shelf","All good things about this item have already been said. This unit is absolutely true to the size stated in the description; shiny chrome finish, and a snap (literally) to put together. Shelves are easily adjustable, and the unit has self-leveling feet so if your floor (or wherever you place this) is uneven, you can easily fix the shelf for stability. Absolutely NO tools required - only about five minutes. The unit is extremely strong and sturdy. There is a 1"" edge around each shelf, which faces downward, so if you have items that might have to ""hang"" over the shelf, or have a door that swings open and over the shelf, it's not a problem, because this 1"" edge will not be in the way. You might find yourself looking for other places to use this thing... it's a super bargain! P.S. Watch the price on this item if you're not in a rush... varies between $15 - $20. on Amazon."
3,Definitely smaller than you might think,"Definitely smaller than you might think, it seems bigger in the picture. Be sure you want one this small before you buy it."
5,Perfect,These are small but a perfect size to put in window with my plants. Very sturdy. Well made. Good value.
1,very small,This is very small and can hold very little. I don't know what it can be used for in an effective way. Weak construction
5,Great unit for the window sill...,"I ended up buying two of these to fit side-by-side on my window sill over the kitchen sink. Like other Seville products, they are easy to assemble and are adjustable. They can easily support several five-pound bags, or small kitchen appliances. However, you will need to use shelf liners for small jars or they will easily tip over on the metal shelving bars. A good value for sturdy metal shelving."
3,Double cheeck the size,I failed to look closely at the size and item was much smaller than expected. Did keep the item found another use in the kitchen. It's our new big spice rack. Eazy assemble
4,"Nice, easy to assemble, but much smaller than I thought (good and bad).","I guess I didn't pay attention to the dimensions, as this is much smaller than I thought, but it still is nice for small, and light, items. It was fairly easy to assemble and the good thing is, by being small, it can fit just about anywhere. The bad news is, as mentioned, it's smaller than I thought, so it has a limited amount of room to store on, which isn't the item's fault. I got a set of some kind of ""caps"" with it, for lack of a better word, but the instructions never said what they were for, so, they might come in handy for something else, plus, I got an extra ""support"" for the shelves (which is fine). Nice metal finish, when I get the ""casters"", it will be mobile. That adds versatility."
3,SMALL,This item turned out to be too small for the intended use. The shelves also had to be tied to the frame as they would not stay put. It will work for a very small space.
2,didnt like it it was too small,it would of been nice if it was bigger but again it didnt match the picture and was too small for what i need it for
2,TO SMALL,I thought the shelve was bigger when I ordered it so I was disappointed. I did find a good use for it because of its small size it fit in a place out of the way of the tv and holds my items well.
2,This item is smaller than my shoe rack!,phew.. waste of money.. bought a bigger cabinet for a lower price at Home Depot. Definitely not worth the price.
5,Fits just right!,I bought this to go under my sink in the narrow space between the cabinet wall and the garbage disposal. It fits perfectly; I'm using it to hold my scrubbies and such up off the floor. It was easy to assemble (no tools necessary and all parts easy to figure out) and the adjustable feet worked just right to make it stable on the uneven cabinet floor. Now to get the rest of my cabinets this organized!
2,not impressed,"The item came ahead of time, thats the only good thing about it. It was smaller then it says, but will do till i get something else. The english instructions were on the last page (i guess english is our second language these days). Overall not happy at all. The first time i ordered something from this sight and am not happy."
2,Okay But Did Not Function For My Intende Purpose,Good little shelves but much smaller than expected. They did not function well for my intended purpose and the next day they found another home.
3,pay attention to the size,"its a sturdy lil thing but it is a lot smaller than I thought it would be, I almost returned it but Ill find something to do with it because it is too small for my original thinking."
5,Collector's Encyclopedia of Muncie Pottery,"An Awesome Book and A Must Have for all who Love Muncie Pottery! This wonderful book features so many wonderful Pictures, as well as prices. An Awesome book you won't want to be without!"
5,"a funny, inspirational book",I read this in one sitting...couldn't put it down. It made me laugh and touched me. I know I will keep it and review the practical pointers.
5,Grande Explanation,"This is a highly readable and interesting story about a cultural phenomena. The author gives us a ""year-in-the life"" story about Starbucks and its stock price fluctuations, while engaging the reader in behind the scenes details. She has woven a fascinating story without losing the reader to arcane financial jargon. The book is very balanced and a fun read. I highly recommend it -- Steve"
2,Cramer Recommended It?!,"I am very surprised that Jim Cramer likes this book. There's really nothing to it. If you've owned a few stocks before, and paid attention to them, this book will offer you nothing new."
5,vertical separation,"The CDis fantastic, in that it allows for listening to the poems at leisure. One is able to absorb the content of what is read and follow every nuance of meaning- travel back into time as it were. Sassoon and Owen portray the vertical separation that World War One created: between the nation at home and the nation at war, each isolated one from the other. The poems speak of the unspeakable cruelty and hate that prevailed and exposes the hypocrisy of the politicians of the day and age. The content of the poems transcend the time they were written, into this our 21st century in which we find (easily) the similar chaos, insanity and the similar divide between nations at war and nations at home, each oblivious to the others reality or situation, conditioned into a reality that is in every way identical to the conditions that prevailed in the Great War.As a student of War Poetry I have found this work on CD an invaluable insight into the socio-political spectrum of the time."
5,I don't burn may hands now.,Holds the soldering iron without burning things - wife always complained when I handed it to her pointy end first ;) - go figure. Sponge on front could be atteched to case but for the price i wasn't to concerned.
5,Does its job.done.,"Can't go wrong with this product. If you don't have one for your iron, definitely get this one right here! The sponge is a bit small and you may need to replace it at some point, but other than that, it does what it says, so what more could you ask for?"
4,Pros and Cons,I like to be straight forward. I'll put cons first then pros.Cons:Flimsy BoxNo Instructions ManualIncluded Sponge Is FlimsyPros:Good Material On The Base.Good Quality SpringsPerfect For Soldering Iron
4,Functional Soldering Iron Stand - Recommended,"This Soldering Iron Holder works well for lighter ""pencil"" type soldering irons. The barrel of the iron fits into the metal sheath and it is encased by the metal spring to prevent accidental burns.Although there are no instructions, there really isn't much to figure out and had the unit assembles in seconds. The included sponge is really quite sad and not very useful at all, so just replaced it with a piece of kitchen sponge.This works works well for my needs and is a reasonably good value for what you get.Recommended!CFH"
2,SO so so cheap.,"I just reviewed the ""SE MZ101B Helping Hands with Magnifying Glass"" and the quality of this item is the same as that one. The wingnut that holds it together is garbage and mine was already stripped out when it arrived.The sponge is barely bigger than a scrap of paper and it's all very crumby.When you buy a new bolt to hold the top to the base it should work ok but it is very light and with a soldering iron on it, it is VERY top heavy and the cord will probably topple it.Good Luck if you're committed to buying this, but be prepared to retrofit it before using it.NOT RECOMMENDED"
3,stand,the base is a little light and sometimes over balances with the iron in the holder. I solved it by laying a lead weight over the back of the base.
3,"Good product, but MISLEADING PICTURE","This is so inexpesive that I can't complain much. It does what is says and feels sturdy enought for my 40w iron.The issue is in how they show a picture of the sponge being a thick sponge. You get a paper thin sponge. Looks more like a thick paper towell. Still you can buy them separate, but still they should send you what they SHOW on the picture. regardless of the cost."
1,NEVER RECEIVED,"Don't think I was charged either. Ordered Mid November, now it's the end of December???????? Once I receive I can rate this and the soldering iron I purchased, a bit difficult to use one without the other."
2,2 stars = I don't like it.,"While it's nice to have this around for an extra iron I have to stress that based on the positive reviews here I was curious to order this item and see if it really worked as described. To be honest my Radio Shack iron does not fits in well, well it goes in the metal casing but since it is China - made you can tell it wiggles too much and it's not solid when holding my hot iron, I'm worried my iron will one day fall off from it and burn whatever is laying around it, therefore I put it back in the box to be given away one day, to a person I don't really like =).Overall: Would not buy again nor recommend."
2,Boredom is chilling!,"My blood ran cold alright. With boredom. I love Hitchcock, but this book is terrible. Most of the stories here are terrible. This is the first book that I have started reading and haven't finished. And quite honestly, I don't plan to. Most of the main premises are either horrible clichés, filled with stereotypes or it's not developed correctly.The only story that I loved (which saved this book from getting only one star) was ""The Artist"". My Blood DID run cold, and I WAS shocked. But from what I've read, the other stories aren't on the same level of quality.What's so scary about a guy that sells different yellow convertibles every day to Mexico? Oh no! I better hide my car!Oh Please..."
1,THIS TOY STINKS!!!!!,"This toy stinks I repeat this toy stinks! It advertises so much and makes it look so good but it's horrible. in the tv show they say cool words like tadomidah and makes the game look so cool.I promise you i bought this toy so don't say ""this toy is good. whoever says this rocks probably didnt buy it""."
5,Fun gift,Bought this toy for daughter's boyfriend in London because he said it was his favorite car which he didn't have. Now he'll have one.
5,Most Definatly an Awsome Video,Since getting this video I have listened to it and snuk peeks at it at work. I just love these guys. So far I have watched it 3 times since receiving it a week ago. Should you buy it? Well yeah!
4,As usual,"There are episodes that make you go ""hmmm, what was that,"" and there are some episodes that are just fillers for the season. It was worth it just to see the big wrestler dude shriek like a girl and run with his arms flailing. It's an entertaining show."
2,"Great Show, Awful DVD Quality","The Show is Great, what I could see of it!!! I purchased a copy here on Amazon and it froze so many times on disc three I thought I had a bad set, you know bouncing through the mail and all, then I purchased one at Target same issues on disc three, discs one and two had a few spots too. This is a quality issue with the discs seeing that I have now two differant copies from two differant retail outlets. I thought Big Vision may have learned from Season Two's sound issues but it seems that although Ghost Hunters is very good and well worth the watch, but not worth the frustration of the quality issues and lack of advertised ""additional Investigations"", also the quality is so poor the deleted Scenes on Disc three don't even play. Stay Away until Big Vision corrects the quality."
5,WOW!!!,"I can't wait for season 4 to start. If you have never seen Ghost Hunters, you are missing out. This show is different than all the other shows. They show their evidence and are not afraid to say they don't believe a place is hanuted no matter what people have said."
5,Amazing!,THis was amazing! We lost our cable a while ago but had also been collecting the seasons. So it was a nice treat to sit down and see what we had missed during the regular aired season and watch it without commericals! TAPS is always awesome to watch...regardless of the season that you buy.
5,Eeerie Entertainment,"This disc includes the creepy investigation of the ""Manson murders"".What is most fascinating is the ""interaction"" between the living and the deceased individuals who do identify themselves. The EVP's are very disturbing."
3,Remembering passion,Electric eastern jams first seems indulgent but thankfully includes enough diversity to transcend the gimmicky comeback labeling of exotic percussion-with-guitar-chops.
1,More instrumentation necessary.,"I bought the original Shakti around the year it came out, in '75. Since then it's a part of my soul, especially L. Shankar's violin solos. In the first Remember Shakti 24 years later, the flute's intervention captures enough attention to be a great recording, but The Believer is a dissapointment. McLauglin leaves the melodic department a little stripped of variety and it never seems to elevate to spiritual heights like the others. Zakir is impecable as always, but the melodic weight solely on strings bores a bit. I love McLaughlin since I was a teen, but this album lacks soul. What ever happened to L. Shankar?"
2,Repetitive,"I see all the aclaim for this group, but I don't get it. It sounds like the same thing over and over again."
2,No real or imaginative flair to be experienced here.,"Watch out for the frightening singing of, 'Ooshton Ousthaan Bergasun'. Very, very chilling and sinister. Other than that, a rather pallid remake of the 1960 original movie which did have a certain frisson of horror about it. Not worth the cost of a rental - rely on someone to describe it to you."
2,A real disappointment,"Well Carpenter misfired with this one. There is a sadistic scene which served no real purpose, and a weak script. Not a really bad movie, but not a good one either."
3,"Scary stuff, but could've been better.","Horror fans will enjoy this solid picture by John Carpenter. Plenty of tension and first-rate shockers. However, some of the more interesting supernatural elements of the story go underdeveloped, and the acting leaves much to be desired. Parker and Blount are uninteresting in the lead roles."
3,LINDSEY HAUN ROCKS,my names blake and I love horror movies the first time I saw this was when I was 8 but I just saw it the other day and thought Lindsey Haun is the best Ilove her in the color of friendship and I think shes great she plays the leader of the children in the movie village of the damned and you should so see it LINDSEY HAUN ROCKS
1,Under-rated for good reason...,"With 101 reviews to-date, there's not much to add, so I'll briefly explain the one-star rating: 1) Cliches abound - naturally, people pair off or stray from the others, the easier to be killed; 2) Boring - because zombies move slowly, so does the action, the biggest sin in a horror film; 3) Inconsistent - how do you kill a zombie? This film fails to answer the question; in one scene, a zombie is decapitated (the usual way to dispatch a zombie) but he promptly puts his own head back on and continues his rampage, while another zombie is tossed from a second-story window and dies immediately...huh? 4) Ridiculous - a church in an urban setting along a main road is the scene of a two-day siege by a zombie army, (led by Alice Cooper) who ring the building and stand transfixed, preventing no one from leaving...and nobody calls the authorities? I give it one star for Alice Cooper."
1,Avoid,"I usually like to keep an open mind so i got this movie. I thought that it would be a great horror movie and i wanted to see their take on the ""Prince of Darkness""....Then it happened...Nothing! The movie was about a group of scientist who looked at a container in a church over like 300 years old and then it starts to possess people one by one on the inside And then on the outside there is a group of possessed homeless people killing the people coming out of the church. I don't feel like adding any more cause its not worth it. I now hate John Carpenter's movies (with an exception of Halloween)....i mean this is worse than In the Mouth of Madness and i didn't like that either. So in conclusion if this didn't help you then i'm sorry that you're about to waste money or Megabytes (if you're a downloader at least you can delete it lol) if you're considering to get it...So yeah..."
2,typical distortion Christian faith of horror movies,"Full disclaimer i am biasd toward the church and i have learning diabilive that make my writing suck. The movie, I personaly felt was a bit disresepct of the churches. I feel there was no person in the film you really felt conction with and just to much data. I am not going to tell you about the film other then, do not buy it unless you can get for two dollars at local story suave your shipping cost."
2,"As usual, this makes me want to see the original","This was a good idea but it comes off a bad, made-for-TV movie. Where was John Ritter? And they made poor Mark Hamill weird. However, the strength of the movie was the little actress who played Maura. It's not easy to play a bad little girl. She does as well a job as McCormack in ""The Bad Seed"". Most child actors overact. However, her dialogue between her father (as a representative of the adult normal world) is very riveting (not to mention logical) and she gives her part the right amount of eerieness. My favorite line from her: ""Things are going to change around here."" I want to say that to my boss.The little boy who played David is also touching. Everyone else-- a Bronx cheer! However, Kirstie Alley does show a hint of being able to be a good villian ala Christopher Walken."
4,John Carpenter creates another horrifying masterpiece.,How many times will John Carpenter succeed in making truely fightening horror films? This is yet another one. Carpenter's music usually helps make the film and this one is certainly no exception. There is an errie vibe from beginning to gut-wrenching finale and there's more than enough suspense. Don't watch this one alone!
2,it was kinda so-so. I recommend RENTING it first!,I found this movie kinda creepy but not that scary. It was predictable and the ending seemed like one of those cheap ones where the company is running out of money so they throw something together real fast. I was disappointed.
4,My Awesome Review?,"This contains four of John Carpenter's films, all which I enjoyed watching. The Thing is simply an amazing movie, and even today I'm impressed by the effects used. I also happen to love Prince of Darkness, and it is one of my favorite horror flicks. Village of the Damned is probably my least favorite out of this collection, though it's still somewhat entertaining. And who can forget They Live? The movie has some of the most memorable lines that you'll find yourself quoting again and again, despite the poor acting and the mullet."
4,Great little known flick from Carpenter,"John Carpenter crafted this undeniably weird marriage of horror and science that despite it's limitations is still a solid suspense horror thriller. A group of students (Dennis Dun, alumnus of Carpenter's Big Trouble in Little China among them) along with their professor and a priest (Halloween favorite Donald Pleasence) are all trapped in a church where Satan (trapped in a container in the form of a green goo) is about to be set free. Plenty of thrills, chills, and the natural Carpenter spills follow, and the flow and feel of the film is reminiscent of Carpenter's earlier masterpiece Assault on Precinct 13. Prince of Darkness is a pure B-movie, no bones about it, but thanks to Carpenter's direction and some great performances from all involved (plus the great makeup and effects), the film works, and is just plain fun to watch. Look for Alice Cooper in a great cameo as a street schizo."
1,Village of the Damned,"Village of the Dull, The only reason worth watching this mess is Kirstie Alley Beautiful as ever and Christopher Reeve in his last Appearance before his accident(God Rest his Soul),It seems like a made for tv movie but worst."
3,PRINCE OF DARKNESS-Carpenter has done better,"PRINCE OF DARKNESS was a three star movie experience for me and I believe John Carpenter has done much better work. At first I found myself drawn into the seemingly interesting plot, only to be let down by the weak ending. I find that many of Carpenter's movies suffer from weak ending syndrome, but not nearly as much as this one.Don't get me wrong, I really like Carpenter's work. As the story was being revealed the plot and premise appealed to my interests in religion and science. However, the ending could not live up to the great premise and once it turned into a sloppy slasher movie my dissapointment was very great.I went to see this film when it first opened in 1987 and saw it in a upstate theater in Suffern NY with a close friend who shared my interest in horror films. We both agreed the film was very interesting and promising as the story developed. That is, until the very weak ending."
5,Pretties For You,"Figures. Just when I thought this movie was about the emergence of the AntiChrist, Alice Cooper himself shows up and all hell breaks loose."
3,.,"This is a frustrating film. Slow burn pacing worked with ""Halloween"" because it mirrored its methodical killer. Here, the climax cries out for the action to speed up. Some would argue this off-beat aesthetic is what makes John John, but I feel the culprit here is having material enough for only fifty minutes. The levity was also a misjudgement. He should have played this one deadly straight. On the plus side, the photography, psychedelic score and chilling ending. Let's face it, John is macabre."
3,"An odd film, but a must for sci-fi fans","A pokey, low-budget zombie movie grounded in equal parts theoretical science and mystical mumbo-jumbo, _Prince of Darkness_ has acquired a cult following among sci-fi fans. Like many cult movies, the film suffers from a surfeit of ideas, most of which don't get the exploration they deserve. Despite the film's generally cerebral tone, its climax packs a surprising punch. Not a great film, even by Carpenter's B-movie standards ... but definitely worth a look.Director John Carpenter penned the script under the pseudonym ""Martin Quatermass,"" in an homage to 1950s British sci-fi cinema. If _Prince of Darkness_ is your cup of tea, you may want to check out _Quatermass and the Pit_."
3,One of my faves!,This movie puts me in mind of Pet Sematary... One of those movies that's creepy and hoakie at the same time.... Good Movie!
4,"Witty , smart , SCARY","I'd seen this one before , but it was a long time ago . I LOVE John Carpenter . I had to laugh when i saw the alias he wrote the film under . Not too much to add to all the fine reviews here . Just a recommendation . Very good ensemble/eclectic cast . Hope you like it ."
2,"Formatting - Beware the ""Widescreen"" caption","This DVD displays the movie in widescreen letterbox format. What everyone fails to mention is this is not an anamorphic format, rather a letterbox format within a standard 4:3 (1.33:1) format. That means for those of you that have purchased high-end video gear you'll get a horrible picture. I am a bit surprised the picture quality is rated at 5 out of 5 by what I thought was a reputable institution. I consider resolution a key criteria for picture quality and Village of the Damned is definitely low-rez.If you don't understand most of this and are content with a 10-year-old TV, buy it; you probably won't see any of the problems I have outlined here. This review is for people with current technology that want to get the most out of it."
4,Pretty Damn Cool,One of those rare B-movies that actually has something intelligent going on beneath the cheese riddled surface. Those cerebral transmission scenes are especially foreboding. A fun movie that also leaves some room for reflection.
4,John Carpenter's best since Halloween,"This is without question one of the most freakiest movies out there. This movie just goes to show that you don't need alot of profanity, nudity, and gore to have a good horror film. What I really like about Village of the Damned is that it doesn't lose its scariness. I have watched it quite a bit and I still get a tad scared every time I see it. John Carpenter also does a good job with the music which adds some creepy effects to the movie. The main reason I don't give Village of the Damned a 5th star is because it is somewhat slow starting out but it does a great job eventually picking up. If you are someone who has nightmares from watching scary movies, I wouldn't recommend seeing this."
3,OK movie but why was it rated R?,"I thought the movie was OK really, not as good as the 1960 classic. Not even on par with Carpenter's prior work. I do love the soundtrack though, Carpenter always seems to come up with good music for his movies even when they stink.But I really don't know why this movie was rated R. There is absolutely nothing as far as violence to warrant the rating, and certainly nothing in the way of suspense or thrills to scare anyone. This really should have been PG, but I guess Carpenter thought nobody would go see his movie if it was PG so he pushed for a R rating. Turns out nobody saw the movie either way."
1,This is an awful movie.,"I'm still a little dumbfounded as to how John Carpenter has so many fans. He's made more bad movies than good ones and the past ten years haven't been his best. Ghosts of Mars could be a comeback, but with Ice Cube in the lead role of that film I wouldn't get my hopes up.With Village of the Damned, Carpenter wastes a mildly interesting premise, favoring explicit violence over subtle chills. The film just gets progressively worse, up to the overdone finale that features endless carnage (a la The Haunting), but no scares.The performances don't help much. Christopher Reeve tries his best but he's overcome by a script that doesn't let him do much. Kirstie Alley's appearance is really quite pointless. Everybody else isn't in the film enough. It's a movie like this that makes me wonder if Carpenter really has that much talent."
4,I agree with everyone else...,"Yep, all the other customer reviews are getting it right. John Carpenter tries to combine quantum physics with horror and good special effects, and it almost works perfectly. The horror is truly horrible (a Carpenter trademark), and even though the movie drops the ball scientifically about halfway through, you don't care a whole lot because you're too creeped out. The last 20 minutes is Carpenter horror at its best. If you're bored to death with Halloween, you're ready for this one."
3,A little creepy,"We watched this movie for year 9 english. I don't think that it is really the type of film to study for english class, but it was rather good. A little creepy in some parts, but overall, pretty impressive."
3,DIDN'T ALICE COOPER USED TO SING AN OPENING SONG?,"I would have sworn that sometime in the past, Alice Cooper sang an opening song in this movie? Am I mistaken? Was it in another version?"
2,Village of the Damned (1995) (Ws),Village of the Damned (1995) (Ws) is the remake of the 1960 horror classic with the same title. Carpentener's version of the story is not nearly as frightening and Christopher Reeve does an alright job in the role of the doctor. The special effects feel a bit cheap and the music could have been better. Considering that the 1960 version is a classic in the genre of horror maybe Carpentener should have realized that any attempt on his behalf would never equal that of the original. It is not a dreadful movie but still it feels boring at times and I often find myself comparing how amazing I really thought the original movie was. 2/5.
2,it is anamorphic widescreen,the person who wrote is saying it wasn't Anamorphic is wrong i just previewed my copy and it looks great
2,Almost Brilliant,"This movie nearly proved to be John Carpenter's transcendant masterpiece, but fell terribly short. The premise, concept and storyline could have been triumphant in the history of sci-horror, but it looks like Carpenter rushed through this one. Maybe it was fidgety actors (what the heck was Alice Cooper supposed to be doing, anyway?), low budget, or a series of terrible hangovers that led him from brilliant concept to underdeveloped cinema? I don't know. I'm a huge fan of John Carpenter, from Halloween to The Thing to Big Trouble in Little China. I rushed to the theater to see this one, and sat slack-jawed at the terrible acting, stupid dialogue and poor script. On the other hand, I also realized that if Carpenter or any other decent director decided to go back, rewrite this one and do it right, it could prove to be the best sci-horror film ever. Rent it before you buy it; even the hard-core Carpenter fans may be disappointed."
3,One of these stars is for...,"the few cool and creepy visual effects in the flick.[...]As I was saying, the few visuals were good. The film as a film was really lacking. This was not one of Carpenter's best, [...]. Don't get me wrong; the story line is good and has huge potential, but it ends up going nowhere, which is a real shame considering some of the talent here. There's just no follow through. The ending is anticlimactic in more ways than one, and ultimately what's supposed to be a horror film just isn't that horrifying. This could have been as frightening as the Exorcist,maybe even more so,[..]"
3,"Nice idea, but try again","The Village of the Damned wasn't the scariest movie in the world, although I liked the idea of it. It did make me jump once or twice, but it just doesn't have that feel to it. I like horror films that I can really identify with (so basicly, I prefer ones that are set in a house). This movie was OK, but not as scary as other John Carpenter films."
4,If you like creepy...,"This movie, as expected, is creepy. Those kids made me want to re-consider having my own. It's a good movie and it has good actors. If you're a Mark Hamill then check out his portrayal of Revrend George. If you like creepy then by all means rent this movie, if you get scared easily, I wouldn't recommend it."
4,My son likes it.,I bought this watch for my son for Christmas and he loves it. It was worth the price. It was easy to set. he is able to use it for many task. It seem very durable.
5,just a great basic watch!,"needed a watch for every day use, do hand labor and had,had one just like this for 15 years. it finally died, so why change? i love amazon for there fine sevice and value, so why look else where, and this new model is great!"
4,Great watch,"Great watch at an affordable price.Pros: Looks, price, toughness, basic functions, and bright back light.Cons: Kinda of big depending on your wrist, clunky, LCD screen is not as big as other G-Shocks (DW6600C-1V)due to the 3 seconds circles, and a lack of more modern functions like tough solar and atomic.Overall: Great watch for someone to use as a beater watch or to mod out (aka stealthing). Bright EL light with adequate functions for the average Joe."
4,G-SHOCK,"Looks like good product... Nonetheless, did not come with instruction manual. Thank God it was easy to figure out. Concerned about fastener, made of plastic, worried it will break easily. I guess it's ok for the price..."
4,Excellent,"THE PRODUCT WAS PURCHASED AS I SAW HIM IN THE SITE, AS I GET GOOD AND WORKS AS EXPECTED.EXCELLENT CHOICE"
1,FAKE!!!!!!!,I have owned G-Shocks in the past. But this watch is clearly fake! You can tell by the back. It should say g shock resist. Don't trust piece of crap. If you want a real G-Shock go to casio.com.
3,Men's casio Gshock i got,"It's functionally brilliant so far as most g shock are but the face is too small, it's a bit girlie.A bigger face diameter would make it amazing."
1,ITS A FAKE. LOOK AT UPLOADED PICS FOR PROOF,Look at the pics on the second page. I upload pics proving that it is fake. Please rate this comment so people can see it. Help me help people preventing from buying this.
4,Great,"My husband had a G-shock watch a very long time ago and he loved it. Unfortunately, after wearing it for so many years the watch stopped working. I purchased him a new one and he truely loves it. He cant be any happier. The G-shock is a great product that I would recommend to anyone."
3,"Not a ""Classic"" G-Shock","I've been a fan of G-Shocks for years. I've worn them and given them as gifts and loved them for their rugged durability and their utility. I've been wearing a fancy watch for the last seven years but when the post holding on the strap popped out I finally decided to go back to a G-Shock. I decided to treat myself and order a new one.I was originally going to go for the $34 one but it had a bunch of bad reviews so I opted for the DW6900. It certainly isn't ""classic"".First, it feels cheap and flimsy. Time will tell how it holds up. But my previous two G-Shocks definitely felt sturdier. I even ran over one with an Isuzu Trooper and it still kept going without missing a beat. I don't think this one would pass that test.Also when adjusting the time I can only advance the time and roll it back. It's a inconvience and the old G-Shocks used to be able to do this and for less money than this one.I hope this at leasts last a while."
3,it looks nice,My sons were very happy to see this g-shock watch on sale. They are very happy with their watches and hope that the store offers more g-shock watches for a g1reat price. Yet the numerical display was much smaller than I thought.
1,Two strikes and you're out,I ordered one of these and it lasted 3 weeks before it started to lose time and the date suddenly changed to 01-01. Amazon replaced it and the second one lasted 6 weeks before the same thing happened. I'm hoping Amazon will refund or give me credit.
5,Tough as they come,"As a watch ""nut"" I can testify to the quality of this G. I have owned, traded, and collected dozens of watches. I don't want or need atomic, solar, and other nonsense. This dw-6900 is a mans watch and will go through any scenario you can imagine. Good as they get."
5,Love it for years.....,"I've had this watch for 3 years and still looks great. Battery is the original and everybody asked me "" Is that a G-shock"" like they've never seen one. Lol. Great watch. I never have to look for another again. I payed $90 when I bought mine and (secret) saw them at walmart for $60."
4,Very good!,"Finally, a watch that does not get the face scratched in the first two weeks. The face recess is such that it's very difficult to brush against something and scratch it. I especially like the large center button to light the time at night. No second guessing which button works. My only complaint (and not really a complaint) are the rotating dials at the top. I understand the purpose for active runners, etc. in following their lap timings but I'm not that serious of an exercise freak to have it that exacting. I bought the watch primary for the G-shock and recessed face as I am bad on watches."
4,G-Shock Classic watch,I purchase this watch for my son and he just loved it! I have seen the same watch other places for much more. What a great value. This watch is not a knock off. It's the real casio G-shock. What a fantastic deal for a well made heavy duty watch.
4,"Reliable, nice looking watch","I am a huge G-shock fan, and I like this watch very much. It isn't too flashy, and it is the most durable watch that one could want. I like the looks of most G-shocks, however, some people may think that they are a bit too clunky. This one is very nice looking and is not a disappointment by any means. My only complaint about the watch, is that it can get a bit uncomfortable to wear at times. Aside from that slight defect, it is a very solid timepiece."
5,Love the G-Shock!,"As usual, very please with the G-Shock. They are the only watches that can survive for more than a few weeks when worn by my Marine Engineer husband!"
5,Watch is NOT a fake.,"Despite what some other reviewers have said, this watch is not a fake. The images provided by those users do not prove anything, and if you go to Casio's website you will see that this watch is the real deal.[...]"
5,********2011 Review********,"It is NOT black, but it is a nice flat grayish color and I love it!It comes in a cheap box but it has a nice plastic stand for it.Pros:*Lights up blue for a bout 5-10 seconds when you press the ""G"" button under the clock part.*Very nice color*Really well builtCons:*NONE"
5,Great Seller,"I ordered this for my fiance who is currently deployed in the Middle East. Not only did it arrive before the estimated date all way over there, but he absolutely LOVES it!!! He is an Apache aircraft mechanic and the durability is definitely is as advertised!! He loves the way it looks, the way it feels on his wrist and everything. So whether you are in the military or not, or in theater or not, I highly suggest this watch!!!"
5,Ammazing watch,"it's built quality is very good , it resist the water and dust and mud, the back light is so nice"
4,G Shock Watch,"I recieved this watch in the mail on Wednesday August 26. It was smaller than I expected it to be. I like how it is water resistant up to 200m and how it has a little backlight. The adjust button is kinda hard to press unless you use the tip of your fingernail or a pen. It comes with a nice little alarm clock and timer on it. Overall, it's a pretty good watch for $43."
5,All Along The WATCH tower,"Ok people....lookee here...watch arrived in two days . Prime has it's priviledges. It was factory packed . no hand me down no returned item pawned off on me... brand spanking new. I have used this watch for diving up to 100 feet for years. It never leaked. If you have the battery changed though and submerge it into the ole H2O it's toast. Henceforth which is how the previous one met it's demise. I decided to get the same model and paid less for it then I paid 10 years ago. One more thing , I heard if you let casio change the battery they claim it will once again be 200 meter water-resistant . I like this watch because of the little wheel gizmo's. I don't know exactly what they do but it is impressive. I mainly use the timer when diving and it is easy to read and when engaged a nice light blue back light called the ""illuminator"" comes on and will light up your life."
1,The clock is wrong,"Light does not work, nor change to 24h. The lower left button is broken. What should I do to fix it?"
3,Chamber's last as a leader.,"Recorded for Vee-Jay in 1960, 1st Bassman is bassist Paul Chambers last recording as a leader. Mr P.C. lays down his distinctive fat tone behind a group comprised of tenor saxophonist/flautist Yusef Lateef, Curtis Fuller on trombone, Tommy Turrentine on trumpet, Wynton Kelly on piano, and Lex Humphries on drums. Overall this is a solid set of hard bop, that finds Chambers, who solos but never dominates a track or is overbearing, and company producing a set of wothwhile performances. All of the tracks were penned by Lateef, and give the soloists room to work, especially on the lengthy ""Bass Region"" which really lets the musicians stretch out. The cd is a bit short, clocking in at a little over thirty minutes, and the liner notes could have been more informative (they fail to mention the line up), but it has enough in the way of quality performances to satisfy any fan of the artists featured, or of steady swinging hard bop."
4,This is a strange recording,"After having heard for many years PC's Whims of Chambers, and Quintet sides with Donald Byrd and Cliff Jordan, i guess i was hoping that this would be on the same level. The aforementioned sessions are some of the hippest, hard-swingingest recordings ever made. The present session, if you can imagine with all of these great players, doesn't swing much. I have listened to it many times and never walk away with some tune or remnant note in my head. The compositions are all Yusef and kind of mixed free, open, bebop, i think......?Anyway, if you are collecting stuff, you need this one, but musically, after hearing PC on so many recordings as a leader and sideman, i don't think you will find this one to be like the others.peace"
3,Chatty and Fun.Long on Romance Short on Data,"For Cessna lovers this is a fun one mans experience and love of flying Cessnas including military versions. Great Reading, though not the best Buyers Guide"
5,Smooth!!!!,"I'm telling you, you guys got to get this. It's very smooth, not strong at all and last a long time. The ladies love it. What more can i say. Get it."
4,You get what you asked for,"it is the original scent so thats good, but the bottle is much smaller than anticpated the reason for four stars."
1,Did not work for 92 Ford Explorer,"After I brought the part and vehicle to my mechanic ( who works on Fords ) , he informed me that the housing and electronics would not and did not fit the vehicle intended for use. So , I now have to pay extra to have a new one installed after the door was torn apart for this part."
4,What a good book!,This series is by far the best that I have found! Unlike most books that I have read in other series these seem so real. Especially this one. I would highly recommend it. It covers the prom that the CWC characters attend. I won't tell ya too much or it will spoil it for you! Trust me this book rules!
5,what goes around,"This book is about a girl name nicole.Who wants to be on the cheer team,but mary the cheer captain show nicole that she don`t like her by not letting her be on the team.nicole tries to keep her cool,but she want to give nicole a little of her own medicen, but nicole was to bussy thinking about the prom and what people think of her not makeing the team.so nicole tryed to talk to mary,but mary still didn`t let her be on the team.so nicole was about to take action.This book is very nice if you want to find out what happen pick it up from oakpark libary."
4,El Quinto Elemento!!!! La Banda del Mambo!!!,"Richie's fifth album hits off with ""Hit Me"", a pure mambo song for those who love merengue callejero. Also, hits such as ""Lo tiene Ahi"", ""Chequeando"" and ""El Calor de NY"" has this CD in the must have list. Even though La Banda X has been slept on throughout their existence, Richie is still one of the best when it comes to mambo! RECOJE......LA BANDA DEL MAMBO!!"
1,Too Thin,This product is poorly made. My daughter used it for one week before it became severely torn on one side.
4,Cute Bag,"I was very happy to recieve my bag the 1st day of the estimated arrival! So great job on the shipping. I am satisfied with the bag, I have not used it yet, but will tomorrow when I go to the gym. I noticed tho in the description it says it has a zippered pocket, mine does not. Also it says the grommets are metal, I am pretty sure mine are plastic. Which is fine, but should be updated on the description. Thanks for a great bag! :)"
5,LOVE IT,"I have had many of these bags throughout the past. I order one every couple years because that is about how long they hold up. We use it several times a week. After some time, it starts to break down depending on how much stuff you hold in it. They usually last a couple of years. Perfect for gym clothes, overnight stays, etc."
5,This stuff saved some sanity,"After my wife had her gall bladder removed for stones, she still was experiencing significant pain after eating any meal. A friend suggested Natures Sunshine Gall Bladder Formula and after checking with her doctor, tried it. Wow, it was almost instant relief reducing the pain by 90%.The first test was a salad with oil and vinegar, overwhelming success. Next up was Fried Chicken, mac n' cheese which normally doubled her over, was minor discomfort. Apparently it assists the liver processing fats.Off for more doctor time for a permanent solution but this was da' bomb at relieving the symptom"
3,I recommend this book to Chomsky fans,"I never knew who Chomsky was until I saw him on TV. I noticed he was very sharp and punctual when he spoke. It intrigued to get a book by him, but it was too heavy. Luckily, I found this book. This book allowed me to understand Chomsky in a another form of intelligence through pictures and vocabulary I could comprehend.It covers many actual quotes and text which really makes Chomsky truly be a genius people should read and understand."
4,Its good on how you look at it,"This game is mostly drawing spells. Which can be fun at some times. Graphics basic 2d bout not the really bad 2d. You may think ""Wow over 350 spells"" well it is true but some are just upgrades rather then completly now ones. The Wifi is the best part. (screen name cheesepuff) You also get some cool monsters but half are just different element of the same monster or a repaint of it. But its cool. Its challeng and fun. A nice rpg that brings out the ds's main feature the touch screen. Also you can send a demo to another person. Id suggest renting or getting a demo first because this game gets mixed reviews. Overall is preety good. (wonder if theres going to be a lost magic 2)"
