3,Unique approach yields mere sketches,"This was one of Omar Rodriguez-Lopez's first solo session discs, and a hint of the massive output that was to come from the Mars Volta guitarist under his own name. Even though it is riddled with overindulgences, there is ample proof as to why Lopez can be considered one of the few visionaries working the electric today. In particular, the scales and notes he gravitates towards in all of their minor-key glory radiate personality and feel far more perceptive then most guitar player's languages. Instrumentalists may be thrilled, but a certain experimental apathy encroaches on the latter portion of the disc, relegating any potentially killer tracks into the ""noodling"" category instead."
4,Omar Rockriguez Lopez,"A very brilliant cd. I wanted this to sound more like The Mars Volta , but after a few listens I began to relax and respect the musical aspect . Omar wanted to try something new and strange . If your looking for some weird music with not many vocals this is it .The major disappointment I have with the CD ;The fiesta sounding song(dues ex machina)Loud noises on a couple songs that drown out the good soundsGreat music overall . The all guitar typewriter song rocks .A very experimental experience for the human ear. If your a Fan of the Mars Voltas and Omar ,a must have , other wise don't start with this one ."
5,No Doubt That This Is Great,"I like this kind of music in the first place so that was help already, wehn i frist lisented to it i thought it was great. The second time around i though it was mostly ""garbage"". I still listen to it and i do like it that one time was weird. It is mood music for sure no one can say it's not, most Mars Volya fans will like this. I am one of them.Defenitly worth a good few listens in different places to set the mood"
1,Altec Lansing FX5051 Powered Audio System,"Now, I love Altec Lansing. However, and I'm not sure how your computer is handling these, these never played in 5.1 for me. And yes... I went through all the settings and connections and called tech support. It just fought with my computer from day one. The instructions wouldn't be good for a beginning computer user... or even one that had never really messed with the sound controls before. After a two days of using these they started overloading my usb port when plugged in. I think the idea of these is perfect for a laptop... no very well executed. I ended up returning these."
5,Excellent Sound,"I just purchased these speakers. I'm a musician and found this system to be very good. The sounds are lifelike, and the songs almost sound as if they're being played live. There is a slight hissing sound, but other sounds in the room (a/c, computer, etc.) make it hardly noticeable. You can just turn the speakers off when not using them. My soundcard does not support 5.1, but these work under the 2/4 setting for mp3s. I have yet to try them with a true surround sound file, which should work as 5.1. Great with acoustic, techno, alternative, pop... all different genres have sounded fantastic. Bass is true. This company makes quality products without a huge price tag, and the sale price is even better. I highly recommend."
5,Works very well,I live in a two story townhouse. The reception on the first floor is very poor. I puchased serveral different types of cordless phone but had to return them all. This Uniden model works very well. I can use it anywhere on the first floor.
1,Lot of static noise,I was very happy to get 2 cordless units so cheap but now I am thinking to throw away this set. I am not able to use it due to persistent static noise even after manually changing channels multiple time during call. So every time I have to get back to my old cordless without number display. I use this phone for checking caller id.
3,Strike One!,"I've had this phone for 9 months and the second handset has already broken. I like the phone in general, works well, very clear...It's just now I only have one handset!"
4,I am very pleased,"I am a single, I have been single for quite sometime now. I've been up and down the marriage rollercoaster, but we wont get into that. I dont care much for receiving help, let alone reading SELF-help.This LOVE SMART book has been surprisingly refreshing.It reads really easy and has very supporting words of advice. I dont watch the Dr. Phil show but I am definetly going to continue reading this. It has a bright, slice of life feel to it. I am impressed with LOVE SMART."
1,Some disappointment,"I tried go give this two stars but it would only give one, however I was hoping to get advice on how to get better at dating as I had been out of the game so long, but ended up feeling the writer was blaming me for my failed engagement. The book seems to assume healthy dating that you botched if you're now single. I was in a narcissistic abusive relationship, and was looking for inspiring information, not blame, a quote form the book "" you are single for a reason"". Ouch! Thanks!"
1,Fix the One You Got?,This guy is everything that is wrong with America and Day Time TV. He makes life hard on men who work their asses off to support their family while their wives sit home and listen to his propaganda. HE IS ONLY A PRODUCT.
3,one-sided,"I thought this book would give more ""generic"" advice. I had purchased the book to help a young man through a difficult situation. Instead it is directed to women on ""how to get your man"". Why doesn't Dr. Phil give better advice to men; he should know them firsthand!!!!"
2,am i missing something here?,"Am I the only woman in American who resents the way this book and its author pander to women, basically telling us what he thinks we want to hear? Apparently so. I'd never read anything by Dr. Phil before, and based on what my friends said and what I read in some of these reader reviews, I expected to find genuine advice. Instead I find a book riddled with banalities and inconsistencies and, in its own benign way, contempt for women and our ongoing struggles to find balance. Skip this book, sisters. If what you want is to feel better about yourself and your prospects, read something by one of the Brontes, or maybe Terry McMillan. This book won't get it done."
1,"Why didn't Dr. Phil ""FIX"" his first wife??","This is ludicrous. Dr. Phil was married before but they divorced - he didn't fix her. (as if there were such a thing)His popularity has gone to his head. I still watch the show if the topic is interesting but WHY does he think we all love Robin? I avoid the shows with her completely. I was married to an Army Officer for over 30 years but it didn't make me qualified to lead troops into battle. He thinks we want her opinion on everything. I don't!You cannot post any differing opinion on his website, that's too controlled!"
3,love smart,good o be reminded about life lessons ...especially about love that we have so much of...it's a matter of choice.
2,Skip it.,"Love Smart book: This review is for that book.Bottomline it sucks. I'm not being a negative nancy either it's just that I believe he wrote it as if you can get ANY guy you want or the dream guy in your list of characteristics you want (in the chapter titled: The Character of Him) and that person will automatically want you ...too.I don't know if he's heard of Free Will. I'm not thinking negative and for SURE I would LOVE it if my dream guy would come to me when I really needed him but hey lets be real here. Other than that , I liked the book and there was a lot of good things he says about guys in general. Note, I said GENERAL here. He said some bad stuff too like, some reasons guys don't get married is because they can get the doodaaadii for free without even a hence of consequence. That's sick, as one of my current friends said (and HE's a guy)."
1,"susks, sucks, dumb, dumb","I didn't buy the book and wouldn't.From the excerpts, (and based on two of his other books that friends gave me) it looks extra crappy with generic, super obvious info.Save your money.Until Dr. Phil loses weight, he shouldn't give advice on dieting; if he isn't qualified to give advice on dieting then by the same equation he has no authority on love or smarts.He is preying on easily manipulated consumers (aka idiots) who subconsciously or consciously desire love & intelligence; It's simply overly-hyped PR attached to image branding & advertising psychology."
1,Truly useless...Just makes you feel good,"Dr. Phil preys on the hope of desperate single women in this trite excuse for an effective dating book. It all looks good in theory--on paper--and you'll likely feel good reading it, but there's nothing in here that will drastically change your love life for the better. The prospect of even writing a book that will provide answers to everyone's problems in love is dubious at best, but, regardless, Dr. Phil certainly doesn't get the job done."
1,A real disappointment,"I've read some of Dr. Phil's stuff before, so I thought I'd give this book a try; it looked promising. Honestly though, I was surprised at how little fresh material there is here. I really didn't get much out of it. Sure it can be entertaining, but overall it's not worthwhile. I would say that Love Smart isn't much different than any other dating book out there, in the way of real practical advice."
3,A little disappointed,I was disappointed because I really like a lot of what Dr. Phil has to say. This book implied that you should act a certain way to get a guy interested in you. It also implied that you can change a man to who you want them to be.
3,Dr. Phil's 'Tude,"Although I really like Dr. Phil and his ""tell it like it is"" attitude, sometimes he needs an ""tude"" adjustment himself. Books like this are great for breaking the ice with good come-on lines, but what happens after that? In order for women (or men) to have good relationships, with any one, they need to love themselves first. If you are an interesting person, you are inevitably going to attract others, plus other side-effects like being successful in your career and finances. My dating friends have recommended services like Agogus.com for going beyond just checking out the headlines for conversation topics. My married friend commented on how dinners are a lot more interesting, and her relationship to her husband and kids improved with so much to talk about."
4,"Practical words of wisdom, from a mans point of view","After 20 years of marraige and contemplating dating or keeping the one I've got...I found this book practical and refreshing.I recommend this book to women of all ages and levels of dating. For women who have been married or have dated for a long time, it gives insight to what may or may not be working for you. For younger women...pay close attention and learn not to waste your time or self destruct. Good Luck...Dr. Phil, write love smart for men."
1,So Disappointing...,"Basic message - women should not act desperate, should play hard to get, withhold jumping into bed until commitment is provided and implement a carrot and stick policy when he wanders. The fact that perfectly smart, attractive, sensible women, skilled interpersonally, are providing testimony of lack of decent men in the dating scene is dismissed. Dr Phil says women are chasing the wrong men. Dr Phil, don't you get it? Women are not chasing the wrong men, they are leaving men far behind. The books's written for the ""desperate woman"", women, save your dollars on this book, buy another to feed your mind and get your nails done - according to Dr Phil, that's the magic formula for getting a man. So, what's new?"
1,One star is too kind for this tripe!,"The basic premise behind this drivel is simple. Kid's Mom has died, has new Step-mom, makes friends with gorilla, gorilla gets shot, gorilla gets better, everything works out just fine.Except that is, for the film itself. Fan's of this genre of film would do better to avoid this and go for the far superior ""Born to be Wild"".Even Malcolm in the Middle's Justin Berfield (Reece), who is usually pretty good, can't hold this dreadful film together.He manages to pull off a couple of nice emotive scenes, but that's about it.The gorilla is about as convincing as a trash can in a dress, the music is lousy, the direction is tired and dull, and the less said about the script the better. Not even worth catching on TV."
1,Another EX-Z750 Victim of Lens Error / Retraction Problems,"Add my name to the lengthy list of EX-Z750 victims of the dreaded 'lens error' and lens retraction problems.I bought this camera less than two weeks ago and have only used it on two days. On the first day, almost immediately after shooting some photos the lens went blank with the 'lens error message'. This happened a few times but I was able to remedy the issue by powering down the unit.Unfortunately today - as mentioned, only the second time I've used the camera - the lens refuses to retract. I've tried removing the battery, recharging the camera, etc. to no avail. This is infuriating but I blame myself because despite my due diligence, there was a large number of reviews and persons who mentioned this problem. Hopefully B&H; Cameras in NYC, where I bought this product, will allow for it to be exchanged. From the limited amount of time the camera actually functioned properly, I was pretty impressed!Croehrs"
2,Great idea but glitchy,"We bought this camera just before our wedding and honeymoon and loved its overall ease of use, compact size, quick boot-up, responsive shot time and the fantastic photos it produced. Even the video clips are of good quality.The main issue is that within two weeks, we started getting ""Lens Error"" messages every time we tried to zoom in for a shot. This shuts the camera down. We'll take this one back and see if it happens again.Other issues:-Flash/focus dial is very sensitive, as is the camera mode dial. You have to double-check all three before taking a shot to make sure you're not accidentally taking a video clip instead (this happens often when you're having someone else take a photo of you, for example).-Not wild about having to pack the travel caddy to charge the camera on trips (one more thing for me to lose or break)."
3,Great Camera Except for Red Eye,"Let me start by saying I'm not a photo expert. I want a small, simple, point-and-shoot digital camera. I have had a Minolta Dimage X for a few years and have had good results. I decided to upgrade to a higher resolution camera and after reading a lot of reviews I selected the Casio EX-Z750. I like everything about it except that I get terrble red eye on almost every picture of a person (when they are looking more or less directly at the camera). I even tried the red eye reduction setting on the camera and continue to have the same problem. I never had this problem with the Minolta. Maybe I'm doing something wrong? I'm thinking about returning the camera, but I would appreciate any advice on how to fix the problem before I bother with the return."
1,Lens Error,"I purchased this camera earlier this year and ended up experiencing the ""lens error"" issue when zooming. I had heard a lot about this issue after I bought the camera, but did not seem to experience the problem until a few months ago. The lens jams and the camera shuts off when I attempt to zoom at the highest setting. I had really loved the features of this camera and found the photo quality great, however it is useless when it keeps turning off consistently. I now have a Canon PowerShot and am living the reduced feature set, but have a good snapshot camera that works."
2,DO NOT BUY THIS CAMERA!,"I made the mistake of purchasing this camera even after reading the reviews on how fragile it is. Believe me, this is a VERY fragile camera. It takes great images but... I went through great pains to care for this camera. I put a clear film over the LCD screen to protect it from scratches and bought a padded case for it. I had this camera in the case in a daypack on a boat when somebody else on the boat accidentally kicked the backpack and moved it about six inches. The next time I went to use the camera the LCD wouldn't work. I sent it to CASIO and received a $93.25 bill for the repairs. Granted, it's not really the manufacturers fault HOWEVER I saw the padded backpack get kicked and it wasn't very hard. This camera cannot take ANY abuse no matter how slight. Read some of the other comments regarding this and do youself a favor. Do not buy this camera."
1,Broken after 6 months,"This is my 3rd and last Casio camera ever. This one broke (starts up with a ""lens error"" message and shuts down) after 6 months of gentle use. Casio wanted to charge me $135 to fix and said the warranty on factory reconditioned items is only 90 days. I thought fact. recon. was supposed to mean brought back to new condition? Regardless, I owned two other similar Casio cameras EXS500 and they both broke with the same lens problem. One broke at 11 months and was covered, the other at 15mos. and I had to junk a $220 camera. So maybe it's my own fault, but the least I can do is share my experiences with others so maybe they won't suffer a similar fate."
3,Bad design,"Camera has a fatal design flaw - the zoom lens assembly is fragile, locks up and malfunctions easily. If camera is out of warranty repair costs $119. I am on my second repair, when the zoom lens breaks the third time I'll be ready for a new camera from a different manufacturer. Skip buying this one unless you're prepared to keep it in a padded case and dust off the lens assembly after each use."
5,Very very good buy at Amazon,This Casio camera was a great buy and I have been looking for this one for at least 5 weeks!Thank you.Jonathan Galente
4,Good pocket camera,"The camera is very compact and light weight. I carry it in my pocket everywhere. The video quality is good enough to view on a regular TV monitor. The only shortage is that when I use photo portrait mode, it doesn't work as well as the demonstration photo shown on the camera. Everything still is in focus. If you want to take a portrait and want to blur the background, this camera is not the choice."
4,Great But it has a Flaw,"Ok the camera is great and no other compact digital comes close.The problem I am having after owning it for 25 days is that you get lens errors on the display screen then camera shuts down. This only supposed to happen when there is an obstruction that does not allow the lens to deploy. On this one you zoom to a point and it just stops, lens error, then shut down. Now it just does it at random, sometimes its fine sometimes its not. I did a google search for lens error z750 and others are having this problem. Hope Casio can get this problem fixed, and at the moment I am hoping thier warranty customer service is good.The repair went well. They replaced the lens assembly and in since the repair I have only had three lens failures."
2,Casio EX750 great camera...but,"I love the ease of using this camera, and it takes great pictures and video. However, after a few weeks of use I did get the dreaded ""Lens Error"" problem that so many others seem to be having. When this happens the auto focus gets messed up and you have to focus or zoom in and out to reset the autofocus. I did not drop, or otherwise damage the camera, and I don't think I ever blocked the lens, unless it tried to open in the case without my knowledge. I tried to keep it on the audio record setting to prevent this from happening.I sent the camera in to the Casio repair Center and it is being repaired under warranty. They told me I'd have it back in a month:(. I'll let you know how it performs after the fix. Hopefully it will be the last of its problems and I will be able to enjoy this great little camera once again! If it weren't for this problem I would give it 5 stars. Hopefully the newer units have this problem solved."
3,i'm going back to the canon elph!,"after losing a digital elph, i took a chance on the casio for the significant additional funtionality it offered at a lower price. however, after just 2 months, the lcd panel mysteriously broke - not due to any mishandling or dropping. i kept the camera in its case and took great care of it. casio tells me this is not covered under warranty and is charging $117 for repairs. my canon elph travelled extensively with me and overall, just proved to be a tougher, more durable, and overall asthetically pleasing camera. it's worth the extra $50-$75 to go with the canon from the start."
2,WAY TOO SHOCK SENSITIVE FOR THE REAL WORLD,"PLEASE BE AWARE OF THIS CAMERA'S SHOCK SENSITIVITYI was pretty happy with this all-in-one compact camera until it had to be repaired for the SECOND time. It's sensitivity to vibration or a slight bump while the lens is out is way too sensitive for the real world. The result is it loses it's ability to focus and zoom. It didn't help that it commonly powered on while in a pocket, with the lens protruding, thereby causing unintentional harm to the lens assembly.The first time it happened Casio repaired it under warranty. The second time it was outside of warranty and the repair center wanted $137 to repair it - that's more than 1/3 the original purchase price. I won't reinvest in a weak product. I'd rather put that money into a new camera altogether."
4,Great Shots to Go,"I bought this camera because it has a great range of manual features, including the ability to take up to 60-second exposures (I like night shots). As I've gotten comfortable using it, my photos have gotten better and better. See for yourself: http://www.flickr.com/photos/mobilhomme/But, the best thing about this is: it's comfortable to stick in your pocket and lets you take excellent photos when something strikes your fancy. With a mini tripod, this thing is a wow-your-friends dynamo.I love it and only have one caveat: the case is aluminum, so DON'T drop it. That said, having dropped it from four feet onto cement, bending and denting the case, I was able to effect the repair myself and am now really impressed that none of the workings were damaged. Wish they made an iSkin for this camera (or that its case was polycarbonate)."
1,What a FLOP...,I have taken this camera on two expensive vacations only to find most of my pictures were out of focus. I finally gave up and sent it in for warrenty repair. I have not received it back yet. I would also get a random lens error message. I believe the lense is binding sometimes and does not focus. I would not recommend this camera or brand to any friends. I see that other people have reported the same problem with theirs. I ordered mine through the i-net so I don't know if the return-to-store option was available to me. I would have selected ZERO stars but that was not an option.
2,LEMON ALERT,"The functions are nice, the size is perfect, but the camera, well,....its HORRIBLE. I bought one (the first) and as soon as I turned it on there was a lens error. so i brought that back and deceided to order one online, now that I have that one( the second) the zoom continuos function will not work. TO complicat the problems I am overseas in Italy and the number the give in the warranty with all the countries isnt even worth the paper it is written on. When you call the number and press 2 for english, they automatically hang up on you, when u press 1 for Italian, and talk to them, they tell you to call back in a week. Now what kind of customer support is that??????????Then I finally found a way to call an 800 number from the states and the online tech help was poor.DONT BUY THIS CAMERA. UNLESS YOU LIKE NICE EXPENSIVE PAPER WEIGHTS..."
3,Nice movie clips but poor photos,"This camera has amazing movie clips photos but the photo quality is very poor - the focus and flash are terrible. I bought this camera, tried it for a week and then returned it to buy a Canon PowerShot A620 - awesome camera all around."
5,Happy in Kuwait,"I just received this camera the other day and after reading the manual and playing with the setting (some of which I took the advice of other comments, like the saturation) it seems to be working great. I love the big LCD, the cool sounds, the extra settings and many other things. It is about the size of a deck of cards, it is the perfect size and seems really sturdy. I give this camera 5 star rating for now."
2,"Flimsy, bad customer service","Like most people I got this camera because it is quite compact for the quality of the image. I've been pleased with the image quality when it works, but from the start it's felt flimsy and felt like it would die with any rough treatment. Sure enough:* The shutter cover has often stuck open or shut.* Sometimes it refuses to start at all.* It sometimes powers on as you're putting it into your pocket, which opens the barrel which has got to damage the camera.* Finally, the LCD stopped working altogether. This is after 8 months.Casio has decided I'm not under warranty (no explanation as to why, no phone number to argue with them), and is charging me $97 to repair it.Don't be seduced! It's a poor quality product."
5,i love it,this camera is awlsome i have a year n half with it and the battery life is super good ! the body is metal ! pictures are beutifull nice n super clear ! the only bad thing is that u cant record in the dark other than that is a very good camera i recomend it .
5,Very important for everybody to read.,"Ok there's nothing to review since i never received the camara ;i paid a visit to the post office to make sure item was not delivered to a different address by accident or anything of that nature , nevertheless there wasno information regarding such a package ...so now i concidered a lost because i don't have the time to do any farther investigation . I contacted the saler via e-mail who said that he paid usps for a sign up at delivery; so i wonder if he ever received a confirmation of the package delivered in such a date or else ."
2,Beware LCD Problems,"Got this camera and two days later the LCD failed. We had to fight like heck with the retailer (not Amazon) to take the thing back. I did some research and apparently this camera has two quality control problems. 1. The LCD and 2. Lens Error problems.It appears from others that Casio does not stand behind the LCD. We know we did nothing that would have caused the LCD to fail. We hadn't had the unit long enough to do anything that might make it fail.Otherwise, it's a neat little camera. I just hope our 2nd unit lasts longer than the first."
4,Bars Freshness,"Don't waste your time ordering them from Amazon. The 2 boxes I ordered were stale.I am very disappointed. I used to buy these ALL the time, but now no one sells them in 12 count boxes."
3,"EAS Protein Bars, low carbohydrate","The bars are all they advertise though are subject to personal taste and preferences, I've eaten about 100 boxes of 12 ea in pursuit of my weight loss & management. However, Amazon's care, custody, shipping and handling is horrible - in the summer - the bars arrived melted, stuck to the wrappers, adulterated and virtually unusable. Amazon has done nothing to correct the problem to my knowledge. Thus, perfectly good product is ruined in shipping, sitting in hot warehouses or trucks and arrive plastered to the wrappers, flattened and altered. Beware when ordering these bars in summertime as they will melt when a common carrier such USPS or FedEx is used. Or, do an express delivery, which substantiall increases the cost and removes the benefit of the bargain offered by Amazon.EAS AdvantEdge, Carb Control Nutrition Bar, Cookies and Cream (12 Bars)"
5,A Must For Any Carb Watcher!,These are the best low carb bars out there. I have tried them all and think these rock. They have a nice sweet/salty flavor with no bad aftertaste. It also tastes like they have Rice Crispies thrown in them to give it that crunch! Don't go anywhere else!
2,too much salt,"these taste alot better than the chocolate chip brownie version ones, but salt is too high. Both of these products are not worth the money."
3,"Tasty, and fit in with my carb-control needs, but...","But be careful. If you are sensitive to sugar alcohols or large amounts of fiber, it may loosen up your system, if you know what I mean!The flavor is very good, and they are filling enough to carry this fast-oxidizer for several hours before I need to eat again. I bought several cases, but came to realize they were causing problems for me by way of a lot of intestinal gas and loose stool. But if you're not as sensitive to the stuff as I am, it may suit you just fine."
2,Nutrition Bar,"Good value - cheaper through Amazon Prime than my local discount stores. However it tastes terrible & it was a waste for me to buy an entire case. Silly me, I was expecting something closer to the taste of Reese's Peanut Butter Cups. Be sure to try one of these bars in a store where they sell singles first (Walgreen's) before purchasing a case like I did. If you find you like the way they taste, then I suggest Amazon Prime is the best deal in town."
1,"Good taste , days of stomach upset.",I like these but i have so much stomach discomfort from the sugar alcohols. The 3-4 days of bloating and gas are not worth it.
4,EAS AdvantEdge Carb Control Nutrition Bar,It is a good substitute for the real thing and does good at curbing the cravings. I will purchase again.
1,Is this normal?,"I ordered the nutrition bars this winter and was really disappointed to open a bar and have more of the ""cream"" come off on the wrapper than stick to the bar. The flavor is ok, not great, but I'm thinking the bars might not be really fresh. It certainly wasn't warm enough to melt the product. It doesn't make me want to eat another bar and I have 11 more!! Wouldn't recommend."
5,Best Protein Bars,I have tried many protein bars and these are the best tasting by far. You will think you are cheating!
3,EAS CArb Control Nutrition bar,These are pretty goo but if you want a bar with an even better Protein to fat ratio try Pure Protein Bars from Supplement Warehouse. Id be happy to buy them from Amazon prime but the best price bay far comes from Supplement Warehouse even with shipping cost considered
1,disappointed,This item arrived all melted and sloppy. And it looked like it had sat around in the wharehouse a long time before it was sent. Very disappointing.
5,How to avoid the melted bar problem...,"First, the bars taste good, just pick a flavor you like. Second, the nutrition mix is perfect with very low carbs and a good protein weight. I could buy more expensive bars elsewhere, with slightly better stats, but these are great!Some report melting problems. When it is hot and you get a shipment, don't open the box or take the shrink wrap off (if it is), just put it in the freezer for an hour or so, then sit on the counter. The chocolate and fill will return to solid form, and not stick to the wrappers when you unwrap a bar to eat it.I've been using these kinds of products for 40 years (Joe Weider and York Barbell started it all) and the EAS bars are fantastic, newbies just need to learn how to deal with summer heat issues."
4,Fresh and filling,I've been happy with the EAS CarbControl bars I've purchased from Amazon. They're pretty fresh (sometimes the ones I get from WalMart are not so much) and I've always loved the product because they're so protein and fiber-heavy that they leave me satisfied until lunch. I just wish they'd stick to their flavors. Whenever I get to really liking one (like the old chocolate strawberry mousse - I really miss that one) they discontinue it and I have to find another. This is the best chocolate-flavored one I've found.
1,Low carb bar,Very yummy especially for the most staunch chocoholics!! The consistency is not grainy like some protein bars can be and it is very filling!
4,Good Combo Device - Recommend for students,"This device is a good combination of both a tuner and a metronome. This is a must buy purchase for all of my private students (mainly middle school level). For the low cost, it is a great investment to have both devices rolled up into one. It performs adequetly in both functions. The tuner is fairly responsive. I especially enjoy that you can play chromatic sounding pitches. The metronome has a good amount of functions like tempo tapping and different beat patterns.Certainly, it does not provide the quality of a single device devoted to only job. But the cost/benefit is an attractive quality. I would recommend this for middle school and perhaps high school students. Any student planning on pursuing a major or a career in music should invest in higher end devices though, as this does not provide the options or sensitivity of those devices."
4,compact and easy to use,really like this product - only reason 4 out of 5 stars is that the packaging (for mailing) was a bit skimpy and the product's box was smashed. product was fine in spite of this.
5,all in one,It delivers what it claims. I recommend to buy it with the microphone for better accuracy.
5,real nice,I have no complaints about this at all I'm a bass player so it works great with my 6 & 5 string so thats good enough for me.
5,PHENOMENAL! I LOVE IT!!!,"I love this! I love that it is a tuner and a metronome. It has a lot of settings (I haven't figured them all out yet). It is high-quality. The metronome isn't LOUD, so it isn't designed for a big group to play over or anything. But it's definitely loud enough for personal use. The tuner works well, and it catches my playing even while people are playing all around me. I love it. It's worth the money!Also, when I pulled this out in band for the first time, my teacher asked to look at it because it was a really nice one. Now in class when he needs a metronome or a tuner, he comes and pulls it off my stand. :D"
4,The TM-40 is great,I like the idea of having a tuner and metronome in one machine. It saves room in my bagpipe case. The fold-up stand is nice when playing the practice chanter by yourself.The metronome by itself is not loud enough for a group practicing together. What I do is connect the metronome to a small radio with an MP3 style jack and turn on the volume!I bought the TM-40 about one month ago and overall I am happy with it.
2,Not Worth Your Money,"I was excited when I bought the Korg TM-40 over two years ago, only to receive something of poor sound quality. It has many options to choose from from both the tuner and the metronome side, which I loved. But with the violin, the sound over powers the sound of the metronome. You can find much louder and better quality metronome for same or better price, this is not worth my money."
3,Good tuner and metronome,"I really like this product as it comes complete with all functions anyone needs. I just miss the ""mecanical"" click of a mechanic metronome. The rest is just great. i've bought a cable which allows me to connect the metronome to my line6 amp and the result is much much better."
3,Tuner unable to identify pitch,"This Korg TM-40 tuner/metronome combo is a great concept, but its execution may be flawed.This tuner can't consistently identify the high E on my classical guitar, sometimes showing A instead. Tried with the piano with the same result. Sometimes successive notes would be identified incorrectly (e.g. E-D-C were identified as A-G-F).The problem seems to be more acute with pitches in a certain range, e.g. notes around A-440. It would show a pitch a 4th or 5th away from the actual note played.Maybe the tuner I received is faulty. I e-mailed Instrument Store six days ago to request for an RMA, but have not heard back. Buyers beware."
3,"Good for a single package, but there are better","Pros: It's a good tuner, it's a good metronome, and it's a great combination package. The flip-out stand on the back makes it easier to see than when it's lying flat. The metronome has excellent selections of different rhythms and is easy to program.Cons: the buttons on the front are raised on top of other raised areas, and it's too easy to accidentally turn the unit on. The tuning sound activated once in my pocket while I was sitting in the audience at a band contest. Also, unlike the CA-30 tuner, this one favors higher notes strongly over bass and makes it difficult to tune low instruments in a noisy environment.Also, it quit working suddenly after about a year. Other people I know who've had this tuner have complained about lack of durability."
4,Great but does not select key of your instrument,I like this tuner in every respect except the following:1. It does not allow you to select the key of the instrument; some tuners (like my old Casio) have this setting2. It does not record in stereo or make coffee. (just kidding)Overall it is a nicer tuner than the Casio I had the previous 6 years that would only stay on 1 minute and then shut itself off.The metronome function is VERY easy to use.
4,Worth it for the price.,"Digital tuners can range up to $2k for the nice ones. This tuner is kind of like a mediocre movie - if you go into it thinking it sucks, it'll end up being an ok flik. If it gets talked up too much and it ends up being mediocre, then it sucks.This is a mediocre tuner, don't expect high end digital accuracy, and you won't be disappointed in your purchase. I wouldn't build a career tuning pianos around this one, but for the amateur pianist needing to check a note here and there, it's perfect."
3,It hears music in its head,"The Korg TM-40, like its sibling CA-40, can do a fine job of tuning. However, there are times that the needle will move to a tune of its own even when there is no guitar plucking anywhere in the vicinity. It will go back and forth, sometimes for 30 seconds or so. Other times, it will not register any note! Very strange indeed. Perhaps Korg needs to work on the circuits and fix this quirky problem."
3,Difficult to Understand,I have yet to succeed in using this product because as an early-dementia patient I cannot understand how to work it with more than one octave. I cannot understand the manual.
3,Nice tuner; annoying metronome,"Tuner works as it should-- almost a little too precisely (it's pretty sensitive).The metronome will drive you crazy. It has various beats which is a nice touch, but the sounds are horrible. Think of the most sterile electronic clicks/beeps you can and then add nails-on-chalkboard for good measure. There are much better sounding metronomes out there. I bought this Korg for the tuner function and that's about all I'll use it for."
4,Good buy!,"Works reliably and well. Only ""defect"": The pitch of the sound output should be retained when turned off - I use it to practice Bb cornet buzzing, and have to ramp up from middle C to Bb every time I turn it on. Very fatiguing!"
2,Korg Guitar Tuner,"The tuner is either too sensitive and is picking up overtones from my guitar, or mal functioning. I cannot simply tune each string as the monitor needle dances around too much."
5,Nicely Done,Very accurate tuner. In my band it is required that we have this tuner and I can see why. It is very accurate and my french horn sounds great with the rest of the band.
3,pretty good,"The metronome only has certain speeds- and does not move by intervals of one, which I finda annoying. But other than that it's fine."
4,Barato y excelente producto.,No le doy las 5 estrellas solo por que creo que podria ser más rapido el reconocimiento de las notas (Calibrador) y el beep del metronomo podria ser un poco más fuerte... pero aparte de eso una excelente compra.
3,Nice,"People have mentioned before about this product being great for strings, I play the clarinet and is finicky about tuning, so its very nice for me, for an alright price :D"
1,A Piece of Junk,"After reviewing so many positive reviews from Amazon, I purchased Korg TM 40. Initially, it worked very well. I threw all original packings coming with this product. To my surprise, it stops responding to E pitch from my violin string after 10 days. For G, D, A, pitchs, it responds inaccurately. For G, it goes from F, F#, D, and stop at G. For A, it goes from G, F, E, and so on. Now I cannot return it to Amason because I do not have the original packing box. On the other hand, on the manual or Korg website, there is no phone number for you to call for help. It is a real piece of junk for this product and the service from korg. Don't buy it."
4,Korg TM-40,"This is an excellent product.This tuner is just perfect, I can tune my cello and have a better practice sesion since I got the korg TM-40 because of all its features."
4,"Good, solid little metronome","Very solid, and portable metronome - easily fits in the accessory compartment of my violin case, unlike my previous metronome. Both the metronome & tone function are loud and crisp, and its ability to play the metronome and tuner simultaneously are extremely useful. Battery life is O.K., which is to be expected since it runs on AAA batteries. I was a little disappointed that the metronome only allows tempo changes in set increments (e.g. 60, 63, 69, etc.)like a traditional metronome rather than allowing me to set any tempo (e.g. I cannot set the metronome at, say, 123 - the Korg metronome only allow 120 or 126). Overall, a very nice metronome with a large set of functions for the average musician. Highly recommend."
5,Best Tuner and Metronome (2-in-One),"I go for guitar lessons, before starting the class I use Korg TM-40 to tune my guitar. It provides accurate tuning. The Tempo and Tap features are really good. I really like this product. It serves my purpose."
5,A *CHORD* detector too. This thing is haunted!,"OK. First of all 10 out of 10. This thing is great but it does something I don't understand, didn't expect and LOVE! I was playing my uke while the tuner was on and noticed that it was properly detecting the chord I was playing; great for practicing.Very cool but I sure don't understand how it does that.Very fast delivery too. Thanks, Shoreline."
2,Opened,"I had boughted this brand new, and when I recieved the package, the box holding the met. was opened. Also the instructions were not in the best condition. Though I did revcieve it in the correct amount of time."
1,Complicated,We found this difficult to use. I didn't understand the instructions and couldn't get it to work the way I had hoped. We had planned to use this in teaching our children to play the trumpet. We haven't used it at all.
2,Full-featured but too quiet,"This all-in-one device has most of the features you would need. The tuner works as well as any of the cheap-o Korg tuners out there, at least when used with a clarinet. The problem is, the two AA batteries don't put out enough juice to allow you to hear the metronome while playing a wind instrument. Maybe if you played the lute or viol or something you'd be okay. I recommend looking for metronomes that have at least a 9v battery as they tend to put out enough sound to be usable."
3,good but some minor flaws,"I have a Taylor GS and found tuning out of the box quite frustrating that I ended up using the tone generator and tuned by ear. As mentioned by other reviews, there are some issues with not auto recognizing the string played. This can be fixed by 2 ways, 1) make sure no ambient noise (tv or talking will get picked up by tuner mic) 2) used the line-in mic option (100% accurate)I found also that messing around with the Hertz setting really screws up your tuning, keep at 440 is fine. The instructions vaguely describes what this is for, but if most people start playing around with the setting, this affects the tuning.The metronome setting is easy and useful, wish there was a steady traditional steady tick sound instead of the digital beep stressed on the first beat and ticks on the rest of the beats.overall a good investment, tuning by ear is still my preferred method, the A by the tone generator is accurate enough for this purpose."
3,Works fine for me,"Korg is a well-known brand name, so I ordered this tuner for use with my flute, and it works just fine. I like that it also has a digital metronome which comes in handy when I practice. The metronome is pretty flexible with different patterns from which to choose. Overall this is a very adequate, although not incredible, piece of equipment. If you need a decent tuner, this one will work just fine. The metronome function is gravy."
5,Really helpful,"I am self-teaching myself the guitar and this tuner/metronome is really helpful. It has volume control so you can make the metronome and ""sound out"" option as loud as you'd like. It's study and slim so it fits nicely on the music stand or by itself on a table using its little kickstand. A bit sensitive to other noises and appears to have no auto shut off."
4,Very entertaining,"I have read many of Lori Wick's books and this series is one of my favorites. Personally, I like the last two books of this series a bit better, but that is personal preference. Whatever Tomorrow Brings is probably the longest story of the four, but it moves quickly and keeps you engaged as the siblings navigate their way through the world without their parents. As Time Goes By is a tender story of forgiveness and wrongs made right. I found the drastic turnaround of Sylvia a bit unbelievable but it doesn't detract from the story. Good read especially for all Lori Wick fans!"
4,Classic slip-on doesn't disappoint,"The price I purchased this pair of slip-on's was too good to pass on ($45), even though I really didn't need another pair of black loafers for business wear. But I pulled the trigger on the deal as the quality of the shoe is worth 2 to 2 1/2 times more than the price I paid.Comfort-wise, my feet have their own secure shell to relax in - wish the rest of my body could say the same.I gave it 4 stars rather than 5 only because the shoe was a bit plainer than I wanted - but nevertheless very attractive and good for office wear.I've owned a number of pairs of Bostonian's before, and have, even as a Yankee fan, liked them alot (but I still hate the Red Sox!). This particular pair is no different.shoe: Bostonian Men's Ocala Slip-on,Black,10.5 M[...]"
2,Nice Enough But A Bit Flat,"Cardigans` third record is, well, not all that different from their previous ones. This time the lyrics get a little darker and cynical at parts, although the songs remain poppy, acessible, and, unfortunately, a bit forgettable. This is easy listening, which isn`t too bad but it`s not that exciting either and becomes a somewhat repetitive album. This meld of pop, lounge and kitsch is mildly entertaining but ìsn`t enough to make a solid record. Still, there are some good songs here, like the pretty ""The Great Divide"" or the catchy ""Been It"", even if the rest ends up sounding the same. Cute and listenable, but that`s it. The bands` next release, ""Gran Turismo"", is a more consistent and ambitious offering, stepping in a new and darker direction."
2,"""Just say that you need me...""","First Band on the Moon by The Cardigans had the potential to be a great pop album but there are only 2 good tracks, Lovefool and Been It. Most of the time I don't care for the songs that were huge hits but the rest of the songs are boring and lifeless. The Cardigans have a great sound but too bad they couldn't churn out timeless songs."
1,A little bummed,"This CD never came! I ordered two Cardigan CDs from this location, but when the package came, there was only 1 CD in it! So, as far as a review, I'm sorry to say, I'm not very pleased. However, I guess when you choose to buy the CD that only costs a penny, you have to be prepared to get what you paid for. :)"
3,Where are they now?,"""The Cardigans"" were one of those bands that got popular suddenly, and then vanished the same way, in the US anyhow. They have released a few albums, but ""First Band On The Moon"" was their big one. ""Lovefool"" was the hit from this, and it was also on the ""Romeo And Juliet"" soundtrack. The rest of the stuff here is good, and much like that song, happy and 60's sounding. In fact, half these songs could be about death, and you wouldn't know it because the delivery is so pop and catchy. ""Been It"" and ""Step On Me"" are good, and there's also a cover of ""Iron Man"", that people will either love, or shoot themselves over. Anyway, it's a good album, and a nice slice of 1996 alt-pop."
4,Vintage Cardigans,"The Cardigans have produced an album of irresistable pop tunes, which bodes well with Nina Persson's cool, controlled vocal talents. ""First Band on the Moon"" has a definite retro sound, combining the usage of instruments such as flutes, violins and guitars to great effect. The songs on the album are highly catchy, with the smash-hit song 'Lovefool' indicating what to expect. The most surprising song on the album is the cover of Black Sabbath's 'Iron Man'. The Cardigans version is breathy and laidback, and sits perfectly with the other songs. Moreover, this album can be seen as an extension of the Cardigans previous album 'Life', although the lyrics this time around are darker and enigmatic. Nevertheless, this album is quite approachable and is easy to listen to."
2,Few Good Songs,This is one of the worst albums in my CD collection!! I am tring to get rid of it but everyone who has borrowed it from me said it sucked. I thought that the 60'S and hippie music has already died but I guess not!!!
2,A true dissappointment from a great pop band,"I bought ""First Band on the Moon"" purely from the reputation of their first album, which is one of my favorites. The first time I listened to ""First Band on the Moon"", I was underwhelmed by it. But I kept listening to it, hoping it would grow on me. Hasn't happened. Where are the great pop hooks and the energy I heard on their debut? What happened to the songwriting? This is truly a boring album and I rarely listen to it anymore. Apparently, others feel the same way. I tried selling it the other day and was turned down. The store already had several used copies, selling at the price of $5.99. In sum, if you want to get a Cardigans album, just get the first one and stop there. It will be the only one you'll need."
3,Just buy the Lovefool single,"A nice, relaxing, sound, but very little substance. None of the tracks lives up to the promise of the single, ""Lovefool"". Not something that gets much play in my CD collection anymore."
4,Gotta love this cd,"When I went out and bought this cd it was after I heard the song ""Lovefool"" off the Romeo and Juliet Soundtrack. Surprisingly I found ""Lovefool"" was the worst song on this album. If you like light, refreshing, and energetic pop music, I would highly recommend this album. Nina's vocals sound excellent with the Cardigans' style of music. Favorite songs of mine include ""Losers"" and ""Never Recover."" Please send feedback to me if you agree or disagree with me."
5,"After you get over Lovefool, this is a lovely CD","If you only want the song ""Lovefool"", skip it because the rest of the album is quite different. However, it is a qreat album with catchy tunes and very enjoyable"
4,Bought it as a goof...ended up loving it,"After hearing that The Cardigans cover a Black Sabbath tune I had to hear it. I bought the CD as a goof to see how badly they covered this classic. Boy was I surprised. The cover was nothing like the original, but they did a decent job(minus Nina trying to say iron). The pleasant thing is that the rest of the CD was great. I was glad that I bought it"
3,Do you believe in the after-LIFE?,"The Cardigans had me at Carnival...and continued to hold my interest with ""First band on the moon"". This album is somewhat of the same formula that made LIFE such a great album. Nina's voice is still syrupy-sweet..and the music is very imaginative and catchy...but you could hear the beginnings of the changes of the Cardigans music, the ""growing-up"" phase that most bands go through, which leads to darker lyrics and music...and if you are a fan of their first album, it can be a little dissapointing. But all in all, this album is very listenable and is a good addition to the Cardigans catalog...""New Cuckoo"" stands out as the best track on the album, with all the rest of the music as good as they should be."
2,did not like it,"Lovefool song on this album was good, the rest were just crap, in my (clearly not so humble) opinion. To me, this was a one-hit-wonder band."
1,Stinks,"Blair Witch/Troll Hunter type movie. Found myself skipping ahead a lot to get to meaty parts. You might like it if you like that type movie. I really couldn't get into it. Last 20-30 minutes of the film tell the whole story. A lot of cornball acting, overacting, & not at all acting, makes this a pretty boring piece. Could have been a pretty good film if not for the found footage film. Wasted money & time."
1,My Teen says this is Garbage!,"Finally sat down and watched this with my daughter. Previews seemed to make this movie look pretty interesting - well they snookered us. Greatest review is when someone from the audience this movie was targeted to just simply states ""Dad that was total Garbage, no story, no plot and no interesting characters - can you send it back?"" Buyer beware on this one, get it from the $0.99 bin if its not already there."
1,Don't waste your time.,I'd rate it lower if I could. The Misfits on Hulu had a better plot. This is garbage at it's finest. Blair Witch Hunt combined with adolescent male fantasy. A total waste of money. Couldn't even finish it.
1,More shaky garbage ala Blair Witch and Cloverfield.,"Big movie studios spend almost no money making this kind of crap and rake in millions from a stupid populace. Tell them it sucks, and maybe, just maybe, they'll stop making this crap. If I could give it no stars I would."
2,The Blair Witch meets Teen Angst,The Blair Witch meets Teen Angst and Phenomenon. It does have some bright moments but generally looks like a replay of movies you have seen before (and have been done better).
2,excruciating!,Like watching paint dry! Seemed to go on forever with no improvement. Might be preferred by the twelve to fourteen year old age group.
3,good to watch once.,good movie you know the plot pretty much at the start. ending was ok could of been alot better with what the movie had going for it.
2,No Spark,"I really like movies that think outside the box, D9, Hunter Prey, Equilibrium, etc. and this movie seemed to offer just that but it never really gets off the ground (pun intended) Chronicle eludes to three teenagers that mysteriously acquire super powers, well not exactly, the powers they get are kinda lame. My biggest beef with this movie is that it offers a very narrow range of characters to relate to: You have the good looking political type, the in-between jock and nice guy type and the whiner sissy baby type, it was this last type that really alienated me as a viewer. I really wanted the whiner to fly up into space where there is no air and just suffocate there so we could see what happens to the other two guys but it was not to be. Anyway it's probably worth $3.00 or $1.00 from Red box :)"
3,"Cut, retake, drag, cut, retake, action.....","Just watch the last 10 minutes and rewind towatch the rest, when bored. These actors couldnot remember their line's. Constant retakes,was distracting to the continuity of the film. Hadthey rehearsed them, this would have been amuch better film. As it were, not to bad. C+."
2,Not up to the hype,This movie was not what it was hyped up to be. The trailer was the best about the movie. It was a let down!
2,home video,Man it looked like my neighbor did a home video . There was only a short period of good footage to it and I thought the acting was only fair at best
2,Chronicle Review,"I had really high hopes for this movie. I got my popcorn and plopped down in front of the computer for an evening of entertainment. Unfortunately, I found myself getting real bored. I paused it and went and did something more interesting. When I completely ran out of other things to do I came back. Amazon took away my privileges to watch the movie. I have never had this problem with Netflix or Redbox. Anyway I learned much from the experience. 1) Don't rent a movie about a bunch of dumb kids called ""Chronicle"" and 2) Don't rent movies from Amazon."
3,it's OK,Just a little Cheesey but not too bad. It was meant for the younger crowd. I still enjoyed it and you will too.
3,Chronicle,"I was unable to successfuly stream this movie after 2 or 3 attempts (there was no audio). I had audio on the trailer, but not when the movie was purchased. It was very furstrating as my children were excited to see what they could not.I eventualy tried another movie, which had the same issues.I then gave up and went to red box.Hopefully streaming will work the next time I try it...And the movie ""Chronicle"" was entertaining, it was a cross between Blair Witch Project and Super 8, but not as scary as the former and not quite as entertaining as the latter."
4,LIke the storyline; CGI could be better,"I love the idea of these kinds of supernatural storylines, and was pleasantly surprised at how this movie was put together. I enjoyed the main characters's development, but the CGI in the end of the fighting could be better."
2,Just plain disappointing,"This movie was not very good at all! I mean its like not even a movie all it really is is this guy who has some serious issues recording him and his friend's new ""abilities"". Would not recommend."
3,Pretty decent,"Chronicle is a pretty unique take on super powers, I don't think I've seen anything about super powers quite like it. The documentary-like style I at first thought wasn't going to work well for this kind of movie, but it turned out to work pretty well. The characters were pretty good, but there were a couple of points where I just thought ""Really?"" But, overall, this is a pretty decent movie. Nothing I'd own, though. -Trent Foreman, Author of Nightmare"
2,waste of time,"My husband usually makes fun of the fact that I'll only watch movies with big-name actors.... There's a reason. When they aren't willing to spring for the names, it's usually a crappy film. The actors were fine - the only reason I gave this two stars instead of one - but it's a low-budget flick with a seriously stupid story. I could barely make myself watch. Seriously boring... and sad. I'll be sticking to the big-name actors from here on out."
2,Not worth new release price,"Wish I would have waited to rent this. Not worth the new release price. found footage film. In my opinion, found footage films look cheap. My low review might be partial to that, however, I found the story line to be nothing great either."
1,boring waste of time and money,This was terrible. I should have pulled it out after 10 minutes. The characters are morons. I hate this movie!
1,Chronicle gone silly...,"If your an adult, save your hard earned bucks, this one is for the kiddies. Reminds me of those silly made for tv shows for teens on saturdays way back in the eighties. Almost everything you see in this is shot by lead guys hand-held camera, he takes it to school, ""here's my school"" around the house ""say hello to my new camera Mom"", etc. Was there a script or was this all done off the cuff. I need a refund for this jewel! Wish i could give it a half of a star."
1,Chronicle was awsome!,I am a SiFi fan to say the least. I own over 500 DVDs 80% are SiFI.In my opinio this movie was awsome. Fantastic ending.
1,Absolute Crap,"Absolute Crap! Junk, Nonsense, Empty BS, Waste of Time, Don't waste your time/money. Needs at least 20 words. I can not understand why anyone would rate this any higher. You are invited to waste your time and money. So, learn for yourself."
1,Waste of $$$,"Wow, what a waste of whatever I paid on this piece of trash. Had pretty much no plot in my opinion...nothing to say but BADDDD"
3,Chronicle,"Predictable, no surprises, little boring, would not recommed to anyone unless they were bored and you could rent it for a dollar."
3,OK,"Good quality streaming movie. The contenent itself was rather dull. Too bad, the story had potential. I liked the mock-u-mentarty style though."
4,Awesome,"This movie is pretty dark and bleak, but totally interesting and exciting. Great writing and great acting. Just a really fun movie."
2,Enjoyable but no what I thought it would be.,"The whole movie was ""shot"" from one of the characters video camera, like the Blair Witch Project, and the video was very shaky. It made me feel dizzy at times. It was entertaining but I wouldn't pay for it."
3,Predictable,"Sort of The Tommyknockers meets the Covenant. Not great but not bad, it kept me entertained the whole time but I probably wouldn't want to see it again. I am glad I rented it before buying."
4,POV action movie,I liked this movie a lot! I though the 1st person POV would get on my nerves but it didn't; nice action movie the POV with the main character Andrew was my favorite.
1,What a disappointment,"Wow. What a waste of an interesting plot. Great special effects (what little there were) wasted in the effort to create a melodrama of teenage angst filmed on a hand-held camera rather than a sci-fi/fantasy film. The question ""what would it be like to gain super powers?"" is answered by this production like this: ""Waste those powers stupidly because some people are messed up and teens are not that bright"". Gee, thanks, that's entertainment? If I were a teen today I would not find this film enjoyable, I'd find it an insult."
1,This movie was a waste of my time,>___< if you watch this movie your going to want a refund on your time..sadly there is no such thing..so you will just be upset with the time wasted...I would go into detail about why you shouldn't watch this movie but your most likely going to watch it anyway to see if its as bad as some say or as good as some say...all I can and will say to not ruin it for anyone that wants to see it and doesnt want spoilers..is.......Just wait till you see the ending...............everything else was ok...but the closer it got to the ending the more I said O__o;;;;
1,sucked,Do not waste your money or your time on this terrible disgusting poorly made movie. It sucks big fat sweaty hairy from under cheese donkey balls.
1,chronicle the worst,This thing basically suckedChronicle (Two-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo +Digital Copy)I bought thre dvd based upon other recomendations and it proved to be the biggestr mistake I have made with any movie. I live in Mexico (another big mistake) and getting movies here is a no-no so I depend on getting them from the USA. DO NOT waste your money on this farce.
1,chronicle hd,Your movies a still jerky and pause when they should not. The feed is bad. Do I need to say more.I do not have this problem with netflix or vudu.
1,slow-w-w,"dumbest movie I have ever viewed, I doubt even teens will rave about this one. Some of the scenes were fantastic, as in fantasy, no one would believe it."
4,Engrossing and raw,"Chronicle is a mix of good intentions, deliberately amateurish filmmaking, and almost dreamlike wish fulfillment on the part of three adolescents. That said, this is an absolutely mesmerizing film, worth watching because it is so fantastic and yet, paradoxically, real."
3,Chronicle,"This movie had it's good points and bad. Let's start with bad the plot was less than excellent. This was one of those movies that you would watch on a rainy day. The good well some of the effects were good but, you could still tell they were cgi. I thought i would like this move more than I did. I rented it when it was .99 cents so no real loss on that count."
4,Pretty Good,"A very nice twist on the superhero theme, but its a love it or hate it type of movie. Its starts of slow with some predictable Hollywood teenage themes, but later delves into theories of what happens when humans have absolute power, some of which can be related to the real world. Not exactly a date night movie, but I enjoyed and was happy my lady was nice enough to watch with me."
4,Great Movie!,"Very entertaining. Though the ending lost a few points from me, overal it was refreshingly imaginative. I enjoyed watching this. Don't get that too often these days."
2,Really? All that potential and then just bleh.,"Almost good, far from great, this was another movie aimed at the highschool demographic and with seductive movie trailers caught the adult interest too. Oops, guess I fell for that again -25$, 2 hours, retarded high school sex (thanks again for marketing that to our sons and daughters so deliberately, I mean sure we know, but its the whole image you create when you show ""super-kids"" going from looser to pimp with these illegitimate powers) scenes and an irremovable bad taste, but then Diablo 3 started working so I was able to recover quickly."
1,Nausea,"Sorry. Can't give any documentary style movie a good rating. I wish there was a warning on films like this. I get easily nauseated watching these types of films and did not make it through 30 minutes. My wife watched a bit longer but does not care for this style of movie, either. Her complaint is that it's hard to get ""mentally lost"" when watching a movie that looks like a home video. Just be warned if you are like me, and don't care for a documentary/home video style of movie."
1,Horrible,"I have no idea why this movie was popular or why other reviewers liked it. The story is predictable. The acting is bad. The special effects are lousy (very obvious wire work, blue screening, etc)."
1,quick overview,"After seeing all the good reviews I was expecting a good movie and not one that was shot with a hand held camera. Besides that though the movie itself was...very bad and I'm sad I wasted the money on It, at least it was only a couple dollars though."
1,Terrible!,Well...highly rated and that is why I paid to see this. Disapointment from the start. Camflicks not my bag for one and this is sssslow moving. Some action but certainly not worth the $$$. Juvenile with no decent continuity and novice plot.
3,Ok but could have been better,"I rented this movie since it went on .99 special and I had heard so many good things about it. It has a lot of potential but I felt like the pace was a little uneven. It was indeed interesting, however I found myself drifting at some parts, especially the first half of the movie."
4,Great flick,Liked the movie but my problem is that I can't manipulate the video in order for me to put it on my Iphone or PSP. That is my suggestion to you Amazon instant video allow the buyer to use their purchased material however they want to use it.
2,Not worth the buy,I expected better from this and was greatly disappointed. I would of rather purchased this in the bunker at stores for 3.99 and would not be as disappointed. rent this or wait for bunker diving :)
3,Good movie... Bad BluRay,"The story is pretty predictable (classic superhero origin story), but it has some great moments on the way and is an excellent ""found footage"" movie.What bothers me is the BluRay. When I buy a BluRay I expect great visuals AND some good extras. What I got was a message that I needed to install ""external memory"" into my BluRay player. Weird, but I figured if it needs a thumb drive there must be some cool stuff... there is 5 mins of near worthless ""directors cut"" footage, 1 deleted scene, 1 crappy extra for half finished pre-viz effects, 1 crappy video test, and... a message that you can buy the sound track. Really? Not a single commentary? only 1 deleted scene? No interviews with the actors? No featurette about how they came up with the idea or filming it or anything? WHY did I need external memory for this? I get more info on a DVD made a decade ago. Disappointing."
4,Great movie,"Great movie! Great build up, Great actoin, and a crazy ending. The HD version is good quality if you have the internet so make sure that you have good internet connection."
5,Surprisingly Dark and Entertaining (4.5/5),"Chronicle is a very dark, superhero-style film. The dark part of the film is Andrew's life, which is filled with abuse from school bullies and even his father; all of the abuse is presented vividly. Don't get me wrong, the film has some exhilaratingly fun scenes like when they're flying and narrowly escape death or when they're playing around with their powers in public. I personally thought the film's ending was epic and wonderfully shot. The pacing was also very fast in my opinion. My only complaint is how fast Andrew turns into a villain and starts getting revenge; but it's a very minor complaint and it's actually awesome when he finally snaps. The film uniquely spins the found footage genre for the better. Ultimately, it's unique, it's well acted, it's dark, and it's entertaining. Definitely worth the $12.99 I paid.(Review of the Director's Cut)"
3,"Entertaining, What you would expect from the trailer.","I liked this movie. The whole family watched, we have a high schooler. Do not recommend this film for middle school or younger kids. It is violent, attempted to tell a story about abuse of power, kinda fell short. Story is about a group of boys, whom are more acquaintances than friends. Two of the boys are closer, one is the outcast to society, etc. They Gain powers through discovery of a meteor type object. The extent of their powers is explored, but they leav unexplained the side effect of using their powers... It is filmed in ""Reality TV"" Documentary style, which kind of gets old, and overdone. But as far as just entertainment, it is a good choice. I dont regret watching, hahaha."
3,Camera angles...,"I enjoyed the plot of the movie for the most part, but way it was filmed drove me nuts. It's like the way Cloverfield was filmed. Overall it was worth the watch, and but if I would have seen it in theaters I would of been disappointed."
1,Don't bother,This movie script was poorly written. It jumped right into the kids and the super powers they got. It was so boring and slow with seemingly no point that we shut it off half way through. We should have rented MI3 instead.
1,Pretty lame :P,"It had potential, but by the end of the movie I wanted the past hour and half of my life back."
2,Fleeting Entertainment,"Although the characters start off quite likable and interesting, the super power element ends up forcing the plot down a very cliche super hero route. The film is quite reminiscent of The Craft only with a male cast. In other words a group of teenage friends who are bonded by their sudden introduction to the supernatural.Dane DeHaan stars with a mopey vulnerability that's quite authentic, but unfortunately the film drives that single emotional note to the extreme. His character becomes implausible, difficult to sympathize with, and down right annoying. Generally I found especially the final act of this film (Spoiler: Andrew's major breakdown to a super villain) to be a huge failure, simply because it relied too heavily on multiple implausibilities.The film probably would have worked better if it stuck to its more basic human elements."
2,Chronicle,I cannot stand movies that are made in the third person. It reminds me a lot of Blair Witch being filmed by a video camera. Movie wasall over the place. Really weird movie.
1,forget it!,sorry movie! don't like movies where you have to look through the camera to see the show your watching. reminded me of another movie i saw... distric 9
2,"Great idea, decent acting, lousy ending, horrible camera work","The premis was there. Very Akira-esque in its potential direction. This movie could have been something great, but instead we were treated with horrible camera work and a story that didn't know where to go. Is it worth renting? That all depends on whether you're up for something good, or desperate for something to watch. Aim to be on the latter side and you may find this movie tolerable."
5,amazing film!!,This movie really came out of nowhere and really surprised me with how good it was. It had great characters in it and a very unique plot that was executed perfectly. the special effects were also very impressive for a movie with only a 12 million dollar budget! you must see this movie!!!
3,Overrated.,"I really wanted to like this film. The trailers had me waiting in anticipation but, it really ended up a mess at the end and kind of a disappointment. Money not well spent....."
5,Chronicle in retrospect,"I originally seen chronicle at a special preview. I remember leaving the theater thinking ""That's the most thought provoking movie I've seen in a long time."" Now that I've watched it in HD at home, it is definitely a different experience. I still think that everyone should experience this movie however, I will say that there are flaws and good points. There are times where the movie plays up the change in the main character too much. It JUST crosses the line of ham. As far as the other characters, the acting is good, the changes in the director's cut were unnecessary so I would recommend watching the Theatrical version if it's your first time seeing the film. The hd also messes up the film a bit because you start to see the visual effects too much and it takes you out of the film at pivotal moments. In the end, I'm happy I purchased this, and would definitely watch this film again. The theatrical version has great pacing and is more emotional than the director's cut."
2,not good.,"A great idea for a movie, getting special powers from the alien source and some pretty good graphics, but the thing of making it look like someone was filming it with their ccamera was very very bad. disjointed, etc."
2,The weakest kills the strongest?,A big buildup only to be abruptly cut off by the wuss of the movie. A test without the giver of the test coming back to grade us.
4,Real quick,This was a really good movie because of the point the writers were trying to make. I thoroughly enjoyed it. Nuff said
4,An Interesting Fantasy,Chronicle was very entertaining and interesting movie for the most part but I felt got somewhat outlandish towards the finale.
4,"Chronicle chronicled - hey, somebody had to use it....","chronicle, to me, was basically everything the trailor said it was...nothing more - nothing less. it was an entertaining movie and i mean no disrespect by saying it was predictable and followed exactly in tandem the ""how to write a screenplay"" formula. one immediately recognizes the protagonist, antagonist, plot layout, the inevitable climax, and story descention. however, in this movie, it was not nescessarily a bad thing. it was refreshing to see a good idea presented without trying to ""tarentino"" it up, so-to-speak. would i rent it again? sure - with another person who'd not previously seen it. by myself? most-likely not. but then again, one never knows their own cravings until they do crave (i should copywrite that!). but seriously, definitely worth the rent/stream. fun movie. enjoy..."
2,"Bad, Bad, Bad",The trailer to this movie was misleading. The best part of this movie was the beginning and the end everything in between was terrible.
4,Very well done,"One of the most realistic depictions of real teenage boys that I've seen in a long time. This is a really refreshing take on a superhero movie, and doesn't mess with the core mythology of superheroes that so many of us like. Definitely worth seeing."
4,Akira,This is an American version of Akira. Without the bike gangs of course. Even though the found footage theme is played out the story telling was excellent. Recommend.
4,Good entertainment on a shoe string,"15 million is hardley a shoe string but I think the did brilliantly with what they had,filmed in a docu style it looks at the moral issues we would face if given life changing abilities........ Good concept well executed.4 stars from me."
2,Not A Keeper,"This movie is a (deliberate?) mockery of young superhero coming-of-age stories. The typical formula revolves around virtuous young social misfits who use their newfound powers secretly to help others. These three directionless Gen-Xers are just out for a good time, with predictably disastrous consequences. The ""found footage"" camera work is infuriating - jerking constantly, like Blair Witch and Cloverfield - and the ending fizzles unconvincingly. The actors try hard, and the SFX are good, but meaningful subplots are neglected, the plot and dialogue are unconvincing, and I reject the apparent message that people only try to do the right thing as a last resort."
2,slow and not alot of action,"I see why the movie wasnt out in the theaters long. it was boring and also there was no explination on the powers and what caused them this. it put me to sleep, very boring"
2,Hokey Piece of Crud,"All I seek is middle of the road entertainment, but this was subpar, boring and contrived. I'm only grateful that it wasn't peppered with over exaggerated, gratuitous teenage sex and raunch.Chronicle"
3,FLYING TEENAGE ANGST,"This movie, although interesting, was full of action, teenage hijinx and wrought with out of control teenage hormones.It's bad enough that a bunch of spoiled teenagers should be finger-twiddling their I-phones, but having powers to fly and move great objects?The movie ended as expected, and not as expected. The expected part was that the teenagers ended, but the unexpected ending was that good prevailed. I seriously doubt that any good would prevail if teenagers were given that much power.The concepts behind the movie were interesting, and the special effects were good.This is a good movie to sit down to, shut your brain off and stuff you face with popcorn and a flat soda to wash it down with.Just hold back your urge to slap the first teenager you see after viewing."
3,"It didn't capture me, but it was well done.","The movie was good but if I adhere to full disclosure my opinion is influenced by the fact that I used credit card points to rent it. I always say that not paying to see a movie will greatly change how the movie itself is viewed. That being said the acting was above my expectations with some B movie madness here and there. The set pieces were amazing, when the kids fly through the sky it looks really great in HD, especially the storm scene and the finale. The ending was predictable but none the less satisfying, I appreciated that it didn't set it up for an obvious sequel. Would I recommend this movie? Yes if you can rent it cheaply, otherwise I would wait until it is on Prime."
2,Not Impressed,"I watched this movie and forgot I ordered a second dvd, I didn't like it, and I'm one of those people who never complain, I'm just not impressed with it?....sorry"
3,Not As Good As I Thought It'd Be...,"It was a good movie. But once I realized that it was catering to the high school crowd, it took away some of the 'like' but I still enjoyed the movie. The high school cliches and ""Blair Witch Project"" camera actions were annoying but I have to applaud someone coming out with a new story line and making an original movie that hasn't been redone or have 10,000 ""super actors"". I also like the diversity in it. Altogether I think this was a good movie even though I'm glad I caught it on DVD other then shelling out $10+ at the theater."
5,Absolutely stunning!,"If you've ever wondered what it would be like to get a super power while in high school, this is the movie for you. A very life like look at a fantasy concept. I can't recommend this film highly enough if you enjoy high quality, indie style film making with a brilliant, brilliant idea propelling it -- what would you do with power if you've always been powerless?"
1,Hated it,"I absolutely hated this movie. It started out pretty decent for a ""mockumentary"" type film but ended horribly with the main character being a psychopath!"
1,waste of time and money :(,"Please dont waste your money in this movie, its boring and bad actors, they should burn the negative in this one."
1,Dumb!,"Dumb premise of some sinkhole easily accessible to anyone which just happens to have a mysterious colored light and large fake plastic quartz like gem that gives superman like powers to whomever is exposed. Cheap storyline. Lots of bad acting and equally bad hand held camera bouncing around as a first person journaling of the transformation of three teens as they discover how power enhances whatever mental state they started with. Good, bad or indifferent. A heavy reliance on 37 songs and CGI to keep from falling asleep.The science and intelligence shown could only have come from writers who flunked their middle school science courses. Won't even try to bring up high school anything."
2,Just plain bad,"Not sure how this made it into the theaters. May possibly be the worst movie I have ever seen.I guess an 8 year old might enjoy it. Glad I got it from the library, can't imagine spending money onsomething like this."
1,dreadful,"I despise movies that are supposedly made from a discoverd video (i.e. Cloverfield). This movie isn't even consistent in this aspect because obviously they could not film themselves during the climatic battle. Also, how would the footage shot at the end in Tibet ever have been found by the people who found the first part of the video in the U. S. ? Save your money !!!"
4,Enjoyable and ;pleasant,"This is an anthology of music for the english horn and accompaniment. Some familiar and some unfamiliar selections, all quite melodic and appealing. Maybe not just the thing for undivided listening attention, but I can see where it would be a good CD to hear, for instance, on your car stereo while driving."
4,Superb period writing,"Alexander's skills are formidable, and this third book in the Sir John Fielding series is proof of that. Alexander knows his period (Georgian England), and he writes of it like he is a part of it. His characters are also coming along nicely. This book delves a little into life on shipboard in the late 1700's. Although the book doesn't actually take us to sea, we see the life almost vicariously through the eyes of a ship's crew. And it isn't pretty. When these ships left ""Jolly Old"" they did not return for two or three years, and lots happened both on and off the ship that the people back home never dreamed of. I love the way Alexander writes about this colourful period in history, and can't wait to read more."
3,Acceptable Series Entry,"Unlike ""Blind Justice,"" there is no major surprise or triumph in detection. But interesting characters and a bittersweet, thought-provoking ending make this one of the better entries in the Sir John Fielding series."
4,New Camera,"I bought this camera after doing a lot of research. It is a very good camera for the price and the megapixels it has. It takes very nice pictures but they sometimes turn out blurry, so it takes a little practice with the camera first. Would recommend this camera to others."
1,"Frustrating, slow, with blurry pictures standard",I have hated this camera since the very day I got it as a gift. It has never taken a picture in anything but the brightest light that wasn't blurry. I took it into the camera shop thinking the stabilizer was broken but they assured me that it wasn't. The delay between shots is so long its comical. I feel sorry for anyone else the owns this camera.
1,I am surprised I have not thrown this camera away yet!,"I purchased this camera right before we had our first child. Needless to say, I would have rather donated the money to charity! The flash recovery time is ridiculously slow, but that I can live with. The 4 out of every 5 pictures that come out blurry, I can not. Now I have a photo album of blurry baby pictures that we can reflect on. Needless to say I think we will try a different brand when we purchase our next camera."
2,I took it back - the flash recharge time is the worst I've seen,"I'll make this short and sweet for you. This camera has a lot of features and settings, but the flash recharge time takes about 5-10 seconds. To put it another way, right after you take a picture, the camera shuts down (screen goes black) for up to 10 seconds! This makes the camera useless when you are trying to catch sports action or silliness. You are going to get one good picture (if the horrible shutter lag doesn't make you miss it) and thats it. If you are looking for a camera to take pictures of your kids or other candid shots, this is not the camera for you.I went with the Canon SD450 instead, it's ready to take another picture in less than 1 second. I am VERY happy with it."
4,"Nikon Coolpix 5600 - Lots of Options, Limited Battery Life","I was attracted to the Nikon Coolpix 5600 by its price, extensive preset shooting modes, and compact size. It was put to the test on a one week vacation trip. The shooting modes were great - museum, sunset, night landscape, etc. And the size was handy. But there were two shortfalls. In one week, I went through two sets of batteries, taking a total of only 200 pictures. The second problem was the long time required to recharge before taking the next shot. It was a little annoying in daylight and painfully slow if I used the flash. Despite these two issues, it is an all around good camera."
2,"Good quality, very SLOW to refresh","My husband and I were looking for a new digital camera to take pictures of our baby girl. While the quality of the photos is good, the refresh speed and unadjustable shutter speed has led to several missed photos of our baby. I gave this 2 stars because of the quality, but there is no way I would buy this camera again. Of course, I am no photographer, just a mom trying to take pictures of her kid. We are looking into buynig a new camera which is frustrating since we just spent the money on this one."
1,Great for the price,Doesn't get any better for the price. 5 Megapixel camera with automatic everything. Point let the camera do the work and shoot. These quality cameras usually run in the $2-300 range.
2,Not what I was hoping for.,"This is kind of a crappy little camera. It has a lot of MP, sure, but more than I really need. The flash refresh rate is slower than you can imagine - it's a pain even just for casual picture-taking. I read about this in the reviews but thought it would be alright, so let me warn you: it really is very, very slow. The zoom is pathetic, and the close-up function is just not as versatile as I wanted. It takes a nice picture but just doesn't perform as well as I would like. It will be a real problem when I travel again and want close-up pictures while sightseeing. If you travel at all, I wouldn't recommend this camera. Get something with a slightly lower MP count, a better zoom, and a faster refresh rate. Since it was a Christmas present, I'm not sure I will be able to exchange it for something else, but I'm going to try."
3,decent,"its a nice camera, but it gets a little frustrating when the flash is trying to set for your pictures. you have to wait a long time to actually take the picture. but the picture quality is nice."
1,Very disappointed!,"Last year, I purchased the 5600 as an upgrade from my Nikon 2100. I am extremely upset over this purchase I have made, since it does not seem to take any good indoor pictures. The Nikon 2100 takes much better shots inside. The indoor pics from this camera have an awkward yellow tint, and does not focus well. However, the outdoor shots are very clear and sharp. I tend to use this camera for all my outdoor pictures. The outdoor video works well on this camera too. I am giving this low one-star rating, since many events tend to be held indoors. This was definitely my final Nikon purchase ever."
2,Choose another camera,"This isn't a bad camera, but it does not make very nice pictures. It's small and fine for a kid or someone who doesn't take their photos seriously, but my previous digital cameras have created much better quality pictures than this does. It is not very user-friendly unless you're in perfect daylight. using indoors or in darker lighting situations it is difficult. It has a lot of different lighting options, like party mode, and fireworks and skiing and action and so forth, but they just don't seem to work well. The action one gives a very grainy picture, whiel the party modes give a red underexposed picture. I miss my Minolta Dimage! I used my girlfriend's Sony Cybershot 7.2 megapixel and LOVED it. I thinkit's comparably priced, only a little bit more, but totally worth the extra $."
2,Not worh buying,"I bought this camera a year ago at circuit city and can not stand using it. The flash recovery time takes forever and it does not matter if you change the battery settings. It takes a ton of blurred pics which is very fustrating because you have to constanlty retake photos. All of the extra settings on the camera such as fireworks, indoor/party, beach, etc...do nothing to enhance the quality of pics taken in those light conditions. The camera works better when no flash is required and you can keep your hand as steady as possible and continue to hold the camera steady after the pic is taken. Please do not waste your money on this digital camera. There are many others to choose from that will take high quality photos with less headaches. I gave it two stars because I have managed to get some good photos out of the camera, but it has not been worth the money."
5,Best in Class,"Replaced my Konica/Minolta X50 with this camera. Pictures are WAY BETTER quality. No contest. Other advantages: 1) uses normal AA batteries (which are easier to replace when traveling abroad), 2) lense sticks out (which prevents guest users from putting their fingers on the lense), 3) easier to hold than the flat Konica/Minolta X50, especially in one hand. Worth every penny!"
5,Highly Satisfied,"Its sleek design enables you to carry it anywhere in pretty much any bag. I am a teenager, therfore, I dont carry many bags with me...I just stick it in my pocket! Its that small. I LOVE IT!! The images come out crystal clear. Highly recommended if your shoping for a high-quality digital camera for a low price...c'mon, 5 MPIX's for $250? That's pretty good."
2,very very slow,"This camera is great for picture quality but there are some big negatives. The biggest problem is the slow flash recharge--6 seconds! By then, if you're taking pictures of kids, they're long gone. Also, you have to wait for the LCD to be ready to take the next picture. You can turn the LCD off to save battery, but you have to go through 3 or 4 menu steps to do it, so it's not practical to switch off between using the LCD and not using it. Finally, on some the fixed focus modes (landscape), which cuts down on shutter lag since the camera is not hunting for the autofocus, you can't use a flash. Bottom line is that this is NOT a good camera if you take indoor pictures of anyone in motion."
3,"The good, the bad and the ugly","I have had this camera for about one year now. The Good: It takes beautiful pictures outdoors with good lighting. I use lithium batteries and they last a long time. The Bad: It cannot take decent flash pictures of people indoors. The photos are blurry and the color is bad. I have tried every mode that this camera has to offer and nothing seems to work. If anyone knows a way to take decent indoor photos of people I would like to know. Also, I have had no luck taking pictures at night, such as Christmas lights, etc. Also, the recharge is much too slow. People get tired of waiting and move away; especially children. The Ugly: After a year, the lens cover is now starting to stick so I am having trouble getting the lens cover to actually stay open. I guess it's time to try something new."
4,Takes a beating,"The knocks on this camera are true: the flash takes forever to charge and it eats batteries. Also I find the indoor flash really whites everything out. Indoor pictures are not great but outdoors are stunning. People thought my vacation pics were done by a professional. Also in the action mode you can take about 25 pictures in a row without stopping, which gets a lot of the action shots. This camera stands up to a lot of abuse - hiking, beaches, t-ball games, being in the bottom of my bag and the floor of my car. I've owned several Nikon cameras and been happy with them all, this one included. It has lasted for 2 years now with no problems!"
2,Fair,Probably would buy other camera if I could do over this one takes along time to gechage after flash. It is very touchy and you get alot of blurred pictures. You have to learn how to be very steady with it.
2,Disappointing,"The plot has way too many unnecessary characters. The title is interesting and relevant, but I objected to there not being ramifications for the characters actions. While I have been a huge fan of Dymmoch's Calab/Thinnes series, I was very disappointed in this book."
5,Sounds a little like Roxette,"""Drive"" was a minor U.S. radio hit for The Spirits in late 1996. In that song, they kind of sound like a slightly more serious-sounding Roxette."
1,Buy Beware: Black Inlay Peels,"My wife and I registered for these as part of our wedding registry. We liked the whimsy look of the spyro design.Within 6 mos of use, the black inlay began showing up in our cereal and on our dinner plates. It was falling out piece by piece. Lennox was very helpful in returning the faulty ones and replacing them. But by the end of another 3 months, all but two pieces had been replaced.Eventually we just selected another pattern and Lennox again was very helpful. If you search these out on other websites you'll see this is an ongoing issue. Lennox is a good and fair company though - doesn't turn me off to their other products."
2,Disappointing follow-up to WIW,"After hearing ""When I Woke"" and the even better first CD ""Cruel Sun"" (why isn't it for sale through Amazon?), I couldn't wait to hear ""Remember"". As the CD played, I kept waiting for the band to kick it into hyperdrive like they did on Ecstasy, Drum Trip and Martyr. Well, I'm sorry to say that I'm still waiting. Even Scattered (which also appears on the ""Cruel Sun"" CD) pales greatly when compared to the original."
5,This is WONDERFUL!!! They have done it again....happiness!,"The music that Rusted Root brings out from this CD is amazing....it is full of great instrumental peices and the mixture of sounds is terrific....I can be in ANY mood and this helps to make me feel better.....it is a happy, boppy tune in one instance but a moving melody in another.. I LOVED it and I love RUSTED ROOT!!"
1,it's the wrong item!,"Amazon clearly markets this as rather lavishly illustrated with vintage NYC photos, however the edition they sent to me was apparently a later one, with no illustrations whatsoever. How disappointing, I wanted this for the flavors of a vanished New York, as much as the absurd recipes -- shame on you Amazon for mixing this up with another edition!"
3,The Nero Wolfe Cookbook,This was a condensed version. I was expecting the full-length version. Is that not availablle? Please let me know. I'd be delightd to order it if it is.James Clay
5,"Good Cookbook, Lots of Fun","Great book for Nero Wolfe fans. Contains recipes for many of the dishes mentioned in the various stories. The recipes are accompanied by short quotes from the story in which they appeared. This edition also contains great period pictures of New York City, very immersive!"
1,2 Tier Red Mechanics Tool Service Cart,"Made in China Should say it all, Cheap construction, No holes drilled for the handle & four missing nut's and bolt' . Also when making the order asked for free the 5-8 days shipping, I was charged $23.00 for the shipping. Making this item way over priced."
4,It'll fix your little red wagon,"This is the same cart as your local tool store that deals with freight items straight from one of China's harbors.Nobody will accuse this of having the highest quality steel, nor the best hardware/wheels, but it still does a pretty dang good job holding tools/auto parts while I'm working on my cars. It helps keep me from having to run back and forth between the toolbox/bench and the car, which is all I really wanted/need it to do. I've put probably 60-70 lbs worth of tools + parts on the top rack, and probably another 50-60 lbs on the bottom and it doesn't seem to show any sign of having trouble. Add some rubber non-slip padding to quiet down the noise of putting items into the tray.If money were no object a cart with drawers for all the smaller parts/tools would be even more useful, but for the price it's pretty tough to beat this one."
2,Just adequate,"This covers the basics well enough. However, I used both Microsoft's book and this book to prepare for my exam and felt that Microsoft prepared me more, not only for the test, but also for real-life situations at work. Not bad for a second reference though."
2,Informative BUT - Not Enough for the Exam,"This book has some information but not enough to prepare you to take the exam. The preparation questions are nothing close to the real exam questions, could have offered better Scenarios and how this might be used in real life Mid - to Large Organizations. Sybex is a closer match offering Exam Questions, Flash Cards (for PC & Palm), and WINSIM - a great tool if you are not fortunate enough to run a lab."
1,Still in DRAFT!,"As I read this book I felt like an editor. Questions in the back did not always have the correct answer. Sometimes the answers were swapped with other questions and others the answer did not match the text. (ex. page 612 #17 & #18) Other errors in the book include the author telling you that FSMO's stands for ""fixed standard master operators"" and in the next section defining FSMO as ""flexible Single-Master Operation"". (pages 392 & 393). Which is it? Not the issues you need while learning advance topics like Windows 2000 AD.Also, the book is labeled as ""exam prep"". Why then does the author included completed sections that are not on the exam? An exam prep book is meant to cover the exam.I currently hold eight different IT certifications and never have seen a worse ""study guide"". And with the book being somewhat of a ""draft"", I would not trust the information."
4,Nice book with good details and delightful examples,"I've always liked Skip's teaching style and this book truely reflects that as well. It's got all the ingredients in a good lesson: principles, supporting ideas, and germane examples to demonstrate the applicaion of the ideas.This book breaks down the studying process into clear steps. Which makes it easy to follow. As usual, Skip uses alot of cool quotes to express his ideas. I personally like these quotes very much. I also like the illustrations used in this book to explain their intents. They help me understand the ideas better.I am currently planning a new Sunday school class on Bible study techniques, I am using this book extensively in my lesson planning."
3,"Easy to say, Hard to Implement",I found the book hard to follow especially if you have never read the Bible before. Recommend a good Bible Study group.
1,Rip off of Precepts and many more...,"If you want a shallow book that really plaugerizes other's (Kay Arthur's ""How to study the Bible"") then buy this. It isn't very good. Seems like he just took clever sermons and ideas from others and dropped his name on it. Not worth $$$He comes across arrogant and condescending to top it all off."
5,"Great Classic, Great Price","Honestly, this is my favorite holiday movie of all time and probably my favorite movie in general. I bought this pack for under $12 and it came with all 4 Home Alone movies. For that price you really can't beat it. We all know that the only good movies out of the pack is the 1st and 2nd version, but if your buying for a child, it's nice to get the whole series. My niece who is only 3, loved the movies especially when the kid sets up all the traps and the robbers fall for it all. Since it comes as DVDs do not expect the HD effect, either way the movie quality was still good to me."
5,Great buy!,This collection is great.. It was shipped to me within two days.. I've read all the other reviews on the collection being horrible and bad quality and this and that the collection is awesome and its well worth the price!
4,Just saying,"My 5 year old son absolutely loved the 1st 2 movies, Home Alone & Home Alone 2. But he soon lost interest with the 3rd movie, Home Alone 3. He has not even expressed interest in the 4th movie, Taking Back the House. I guess he really likes Macaulay Culkin rather than the other 2 young actors in the last 2 movies. But we'll give the 4th movie a try soon."
4,great buy,my son is such a fan of the series.packaged excellently and its what i was looking for and it arrived early!! very pleased with the purchase and i am sure my son will love it
4,Love the first 2 movies!,Watched these movies for Christmas. Still only like the first two movies. The third one is ok but the fourth movie was horrible. I would of just left it the first two and stop making these movies.
5,The best!!,This was a b-day gift for my sister and she loved it. She even told me she wanted all movies from Home Alone she enjoys watching. When she opened gift she was very happy I bought this for her. The price is good for the complete collection I would recommend if you're a fan of Home Alone.
4,Good,The first 3 are good. The fourth one is weak and a poor excuse of a movie. I never tier of bad guys getting the crap beat out of them. Bonus in the first one; a good message.
2,Complete Condensed Collection,When I ordered this product I was under the impression that I would receive 4 movies inside of a collection box. I was unaware that the movies were condenses into two. I think the price was a little much for the product but it was a gift and not returnable. Had I purchased for myself I would've returned based on the fact that there are not 4 seperate movies in this collection.
3,Home Alone : The Complete Collection,It was great to spend time watching all the Home Alone films in one collection. Warm holiday spirited films to bring joy to the whole families viewing.
5,Great collection,"Glad i ordered it, my son loved it as one of his Christmas gifts. He has already watched them several times"
5,Great Movies,These movies never get old! Loved watching them again and again! & was able to pass them down a generation
5,Laughs and more laughs!,Fun that can be enjoyed by the whole family! My granddaughters and I have so much fun watching the collection over and over.
3,YOU MUST READ THIS BEFORE YOU PURCHASE,"First of all these are excellent movies, I have been watching them for almost 20 years (original was released in 1990-91) and I love watching them each year on video. However this three star review is based on the fact that it doesn't include the Family Fun Edition of the first film. If you are buying this thinking that it includes the Family Fun Edition of the first movie, don't waste your time. This does include the original dvd releases of all 4 films and it is a great deal. However when I purchased this I assumed since the family fun edition was the most recent edition it would be included IT ISN'T This is simply a rerelease of the previous Home Alone Boxed Set!"
1,TOTAL RIPOFF,"To anyone thinking that this collection might include newly remastered widescreen versions of the films, it DOES NOT. Instead, 20th Century Fox has assembled a shameless repackage of the original non-anamorphic discs for films 1 and 2. The transfers look like they were done during the infancy of standard def, which means quite lousy. They couldn't even include the recent Family Fun Edition of the first film (which is remastered). I didn't bother checking films 3 and 4 because it's obvious this is a cash grab for a surplus of the original discs, which have been collected before. The outside box doesn't even bother to tell you the specs of the films (probably anticipating a reaction like mine). Nothing new here except the packaging. Whatever department head gave the green light to this attrocity is in the wrong line of work."
5,Home Alone Collection,Took a long time to receive the product but I knew that when I ordered it. It arrived in perfect condition and everything plays fine.
5,Home Alone the complete collection,I bought this for my son and he just loves it. It was a better price than in the stores and even had 2 movies I was not aware of.
5,Love Them!,Funny movies! These are great family movies and I recommend them to your family. It is so nice to have the whole series in one bundle.
4,Video quality is ok,"My kids loves the movies. But the video quality is just ok, not up to new DVD standards, but not bad."
4,Good deal!,"It didnt come with a nice case. But dvds are just perfect. They replaced my vhs tape collection. Price was excellent. If you expect them in nice case, you will be a bit disappointed cuz it came in a printed paper case"
2,Have they lost their marbles?,"This paint must have been sitting on a shelf somewhere for a VERY long time. The pigment was terminally separated upon delivery. You can't stir it out because the bottle has no extra roof above the liquid. I put a steel ball bearing in the bottle and shook like crazy for about 5 minutes after cutting through the pigment at the bottom to begin breaking it up.The paint is good I think - after all the above exercises. So, okay but be really for a real workout before you can use the stuff.Maybe you'll get a newer batch than I did."
1,gray paint,"all this is - a gray paint.no chrome to it.applied it to my chrome scracthes,not even close to chrome. you need to really take chrome someplace to have it matched!"
3,"""Chrome"" Paint","The order was delivered on time. However, the product is a little misleading. It is not a chrome color. It is actually a glossy silver looking color. I must admit that I'm not upset because I have actually never seen any paint come close to looking like chrome. The price was cheap enough to give it a try."
3,Good but...,Not really interested in reading the other 3 books. There's some really good insight in this flash overview and a few dry spots. Not for the very new believer.
5,Two Great Albums on One Disc,"This compact disc features the full first two Allman Brother's Albums, which makes this a great economical buy. On this disc the Allman Brothers create the perfect balance between blues and Southern rock. The vocals are folksy and bluesy, which works flawlessly with their style of music. Fans of Southern rock need to buy this album."
5,Good pick!,"For whatever reason, Idlewild South is a rare album these days. Thankfully, Beginnings is here to fix that. You get both their debut (probably the best first album ever) and Idlewild south. Well, why should you buy this over the originals?1. It's two LP's for the price of one-and-a-half, which means you can buy this package for $20, or you can pick up both albums individually for $26.2. It's both albums one CD. That alone is a pretty good reason.3. It's simply great music. On this album, you get It's Not My Cross to Bear, Trouble No More, Dreams, Whipping Post, Revival, In Memory of Elizabeth Reed, Midnight Rider and Hoochie Coochie Man. That alone should be reason enough.If you haven't bought this album yet, what are you waiting for?"
3,Southern blues-rock,"Great classic selection of Allman originals. Did not notice any huge differences with the remastering, but then, my ears are much older. A must have if you want to hear the original Allman Bros. Band when all were still alive. Dual lead guitars, dual percussionists, distinct vocals, and more! An excellent value and a fine collectable if you like the southern blues-rock genre!"
4,"Good, But Poor Re-Mixing","Great Band at the top of their game.Great Set, one of the better live sets of the Allman Brothers Band.But I have a bone to pick with the producers of the CD. The opening two cuts, I Don't Want You No More and Its Not My Cross to Bear are one song. The Brothers blended them into each other in a seamless wonder that was inspirational. What did the producers do? They chopped up these two songs. I had to buy the original album and record them on the computer to preserve the artists original recording. This was irritating and shows that the producers were more interested in conformity than artistic intent. Grrrrrrr.End of rant."
4,Didn't realize the age of book but still good,"The book was older than I thought, but not a problem with the info. Being we've had a collie before it was fun to read and remember so many things about our first one. Now, we have a smooth coat boy and what a handful !! Enjoyed the book"
2,Not worth the paper it's printed on.,This book has very little information for someone who already understands how to take care of any dog. Don't waste your money.
3,Inspector Ghote breaks an egg,An interesting British author. His stories are slow in developing but mesmerizing as he tells the eccentricities of Indian culture while solving a mystery.
2,*,"Boring. What else can one say? It goes on and on and on without much plot development taking place. Not a barn burner, that's for sure."
3,Check out another,"Along with this, Michael Varnado's ""Victims of Dead Man Walking"" gives excellent insight into the true story of the murders/rapists and their victims. Those crimes did not just affect the ones directly involved, but the entire community."
2,"""El Tuerto Angustias","I enjoyed the movie. It reminded me of friends that I have in Guatemala and passed experiences. I liked Leonardo's form of acting...the story while interesting didn't really have a point to it. It could have ended that young Santos was the Patrona's lost son, or have some point, but the movie itself seemed somewhat pointless, but carried my attention right up to the very sudden and abrupt ending. It could have done more, but I would recommend it."
5,A Covenant With Death,I first read it upon publication many years back then lost the book in a flood. This year I found an unmarked almost new copy and re-red it for the first time (again). In all those years it is as beautifully written as I remembered it to be. A great story which takes the reader back to an earlier time so that you really feel you are there. I highly recommend it!
3,Save your cash!,"Stephen Cannell has written his third book in his Shane Scully series. This tale involves the whole Scully family that has been created over the three books, and a deputy chief that allows his officers to do anything they wish. Gone is the hard-boiled edge Cannell has put into his previous books. Cannell has run out of ideas for this series and has failed in his attempt to keep it fun. ""Tin Collectors"" was by far the best work of this series. This tale drags on for 300 some pages, and is not worth the time or the money. The 3 stars is a gift. I hope he can do better in the next one."
2,Too much nonsense,I will not be reading the rest of this book. Has this guy ever even MET a real Policeman?
3,Worth a read,"I like the setting and characters in this novel, but the story wasn't the greatest. Worth reading."
3,"Essentially entertaining, but flawed","Overall this Scully novel was a fairly entertaining read. However, it had two elements that kept it from being really good.The story had so many outrageous plots going on it was hard to keep track of who was doing what, and why we should care. Cannell left two of the plots hanging at the end, with no satisfactory conclusion, as though he got tired of dealing with them and wanted to move on. It left me feeling like I missed a chapter somewhere that explained what happened.Also, Cannell had an annoying literary ""tic"" of repetitive phrasing. It got to a point where, if I read the words ""the little grifter"" one more time, I thought I would scream. Some good copy editing should have eliminated this overuse of wording.The essential story held my interest and I'll continue to read his other novels, but this wasn't his best."
2,Enjoyable story - terrible proofreading,"I enjoyed this story when I read the paperback at the time it was first published. But whoever did the conversion to eBook format generated countless annoying typographical errors that were never caught by a proofreader, if indeed the product had ever been proofread. I hope that this does not represent the quality that can be expected from Amazon eBooks, because it is terrible."
3,a highly unprobable yet quite fun and readable story,"the story is a wild ride, kinda ridiculous but fun. have read most of cannell's books, there's a format could easily be traced. he's a hollywood insider and trying very hard to write some mob stories. a top-notched storyteller but sometimes inevitably turned his stories into too dime-novel quality and depth. all the stories are quite readable and full of fun but once you have finished them, you just don't want to read them again after, say, 2 years later? like ""monte cristo,"" god, could i believe myself that i've read it again and again at least 5 times during the past 30 years?"
5,Sounds GREAT',This is a nice lettle speaker for what i use it for. And for the price you will by happy with it.
3,Refurbished Sonic Impact,"I think this item needs to be renamed as it is not Sonic. In fact, it really needs a good booster as it does not deliver much volume at all. No worries about keeping any neighbors awake with this one!"
2,Terrific portable music for a crowd!,"This player works quite well in our home. We just pick it up & move to the next room, outdoors or into the van. The sound quality is better then I expected. Glad I purchased it."
2,I am not too happy,"The item is good, the sound is decent but i tought than a refurbished item was an item that you can hardly say it's used. The speakers i got did not look good at all. Scrached and dirty, you can see it was used for a very long time. No too happy about this item."
4,Nice iPOD Gadget works well,"The product is very basic and easy to use...only for me I got almost no use out of it. I got an iPOD and immediately started buys ""gifts"" for it, LOL. I hardly ever use the thing. But if you love your iPOD and take it everywhere you go this portable system would be good for you. It is sturdy and easy to use. Only thing is if you are looking for speakers to blow you away, this is NOT a good choice for you."
4,I Love it,"I've had this camera for about a year and it has served well. There are so many functions and settings, so the picture can always be the best possible. I'm still constantly finding new settings.On the downside, in low light when you don't use a flash (because using flash causes a pretty long delay and sucks the battery down) pictures blur, even though it;s not very dark. Also I had a problem with the lense, the cover didn't close all the way when I turned it off, but I'm pretty sure that's because I've dropped it like 3 times...oh pavement.Overall, it's still a very excellent camera, even more so now that it's not $250!"
4,Pretty cool,"many options you can use for this camera. like black and white photos, color photos, etc. also has a recording function., picture takes about 2 seconds to take so no one can move during that time. there are different settings for each different type of picture you could take. all in all, its a good camera, with good quality."
2,Disappointing.. (a teen review),"First off, I'm not sure whther it was this model, or the 4 MP one, but the camera overall was frustrating.I don't have this camera (thank god), but my friend does and she has me take pics with it all the time. Sure, the camera FUNCTIONS. It takes the pictures and all.But I must say, the shutter speed is exceptionally slow and almost every picture i take the camera suggests that the picture is blurred, and indeed it is. Blurred pictures means less quality. Also in dark rooms, if I try to use flash, the flash takes really long to react, and then the picture turns out really grainy. If you really know cameras, then you'll know this isn't one you'd want to buy."
1,Blurry pictures,"I got this camera, but after a few months I was tired of it.The pictures come out really blurry, even if you hold really still. The only way to get around this is to use the flash, however, this makes the camera's screen go black and you have to wait a few seconds.Then one day the camera just shut off and wouldn't turn back on. The battery was fine, I guess the camera just ""died"". Thankfully it was still under warranty so I got a new one, but I also bought a similar Canon digital camera which I've had more luck with."
4,simple to use yet takes clear photos,"The Nikon Coolpix 4600 takes good photos with little effort or training. 2 AA batteries last a long time and are an economical and practical power source. Proprietary batteries may last longer, but are more expensive and sometimes very difficult to replace. The battery cover is the weak spot in this camera. It breaks easily and cannot be fixed."
1,BEWARE,"I had this camera for a little over a year and the LCD Screen went out. Apparently this is common. The warranty does not cover this and Nikon charges a little over $100, including shipping, to fix."
2,Poor reliability,This was my first digital camera after 40+ years of using 35mm film cameras. I chose the Nikon brand because Nikon used to be a premium brand of film cameras and I already own a 35mm Nikonos. After a few hundred photos the lens extension motor on this camera failed rendering the camera completely useless. Both Nikon and the camera store where I bought the camera gave me repair estimates of $100. No thanks! I've already been burned once. Searches on the internet reveal that failure of this particular motor is a very common problem with the 4600 model. Obviously I wish I'd known that before I wasted my $200.
3,Good Practical Camera,"This camera performs well enough for everyday use especially considering the price. It gets the job done and has all the basic settings a ""point and shooter"" needs."
1,Low Battery- DEFECT!?!!,"I am not the only one. After using this camera for maybe 6 months, and being annoyed by the delay between pictures, now the darn thing won't even power up! I've replaced battery after battery, and wondered, are ALL the batteries in my house dead (taken from remotes, CD players, MP3 players, you name it)? But now I see, it's some sort of defect. Is there any remedy? I didn't purchase a warranty. Even if I had it would have expired. It seems that this problem occurs after a certain amount of usage. I would recommend against this camera, if not for the delay in pictures, then for the fact that after 6 months it is useless. What a waste of money. NO MORE NIKON for me!"
4,Good $115 camera,"If you are looking for a good, small digital camera for a decent price that has great photo quality this is it. Sure it lags a bit between flash photos, but most cheaper digitals do. People complain about blurry photos without a flash? Yeah cause it needs to keep the shutter open way longer. So, like any other camera in this situation- if you move it will blur. I find that it does the flashless stuff well otherwise. Not really and issue. Not many issues with this camera in my book. Just a decent camera. Oh yeah and cool macro mode too.Good camera to bang around with for a few years while the technology continues to become cheaper."
1,Camera quit working 1 week past warranty,"I bought the Coolpix 4600 camera for my daughter for Christmas. It worked fairly well for the first year. A week after the warranty was up, the camera would no longer turn on. Doing a search on the web, I found it is a common problem with this camera. Buyer Beware!"
2,"Nice try, but not even close to what a camrea should be","This camera has plenty of user friendly features and a pretty simple and intuitive interface and takes a descent quality picture. Thats where the fun ends. The flash takes numerous seconds to recharge which can be quite annoying if your trying to catch something or if you don't have 15-30 seconds to wait around after each shot. The Battery life is 2-3 uses when using the flash which is just nuts, you need to keep a 12 pack of AA's handy if you shoot with this camera. I've also on three occasions taken a large number of photographs only to find they were not there when I went to offload them from the memory card. The camera would act like it was taking the shot, even to the point where it would warn of blurry shots and then the photos were just nowhere to be found. look elsewhere for a better camera"
1,Not worth the trouble.,"1. Flash lag-horrible.2. Had problems with the settings button sticking- or not moving at all.3. Battery life-non existant. Could have bought a really nice camera with the money I spent in batteries for this one.4. Picture quality-decent, not true to actual colors.5. There are better cameras out there!"
1,Disappointing - save your money,"I've had this camera for 2 years and I am glad that it broke so I can (in good conscious) buy a new camera. It is so slow that it is impossible to catch anything but the back of my kids heads as they run away because they got tired of saying ""Cheese"". I always thought the battery life was sufficient, and that the quality of the images was fine, but I hardly got good shots because of how slow the camera was. I'd put the shoot button and it would take about 2 seconds before the camera would click. I actually sent it back to the manufacturer thinking there was something wrong with it, but they said it was functioning normally.It was probably the most disappointing $200 purchase I've made."
1,Nikon service is horrible,"I bought the 4600 for my parents in 2005. A seal in the lens housing broke in November and we sent it to Nikon. When Nikon recieved the camera they said it had ""liquid"" damage to the lens shutter area. My parents didn't send the camera in that condition, yet Nikon claims that it is ""impossible"" for that kind of ""accident"" to occur at their facility. Two months later I am still arguing with them over this. One of their service represatives, Rob Mustard, told me (paraphrasing) ""I have 70 service orders in front of me and our facility gets hundreds of repairs each week; I've heard every excuse imaginable for why it isn't the customer's fault."" Besides being rude, doesn't that scare you about his facility getting in hundreds of repairs each week???? Don't buy Nikon is my recommendation."
1,Delay and photo quality are real problems,"I researched cameras and found fairly good reviews for this one, but I soon discovered that I would have been better off with my old 1 MP Kodak. The flash is weak and I have to lighten nearly all indoor photos. As others have mentioned, this camera has a long recycle time between photos and you do miss a lot of photos. I also have a problem with the quality of the photos; a lot of them are slightly blurry and I have to use my photo editing software to sharpen them. Everyone once in a while, the camera seems to decide that it's had enough and just stops. I have to move the dial to a different setting and then back to the regular setting so that it will work again. I wish I had spent my money on something else."
2,Disappointing Camera,"I did quite a bit of research before buying this camera, and I am still disappointed. The lag time is too long for the price paid. Also, after owning the camera only about 3 months, I begin getting lens errors. They persistantly increased and then I began having picture quality problems. The camera is basically worthless now, and it is not even a year old."
2,Good Until...,"I bought this camera in January of this year and it has worked perfectly until about a week ago. I turned it on as usual took a few pictures and then it shut off with the screen reading ""WARNING!! BATTERY EXHAUSTED"". As usual I went and found 2 new AA batteries and replaced the old ones. However when I turned on the camera it immediately shut off again reading ""WARNING!! BATTERY EXHAUSTED"". No matter what I do the only way it will turn on is if the mode dial is set to ""SET UP"". After it's already on, if I try and change it to a picture shooting mode it dies.I AM NOT THE ONLY PERSON TO EXPIRIENCE THIS PROBLEM.Again I remind you that I've only had this camera for 6 months. Think about this before buying, though similarily priced cameras I have heard have the same problem.Other than the fact that the camera is not currently working, it has been a wonderful camera."
2,Bad quality pictures and bad quality camera,"I bought this camera because it was small, light and pretty cheap, but I soon regretted it. The pictures at first were all right, although it took forever to recharge the flash, and it's really annoying. Then another thing happened, there were some pictures where some color were changed, specially red turned into purple, making very odd pictures. Although, it only happened a few times so I though I could live with it. Finally, less than six months after I bought the camera, it went nuts! The LCD screen is blurry and the lens protector won't close after a turn it down. I have taken good care of it. Good thing I still have the warranty, but still I don't recommend anybody buying this camera, go fo the other brands: Olympus, Sony, etc. I have not had problems with those"
1,Shame on Nikon,I am a Nikon fan I have Nikon 6T (for my panasonic FZ20) and Nikon D50. But about Coolpix 4600:All picutures are always blurred or atleast fuzzy. It somehow take decent photos of face and buildings(if they have strong straight edges/stripes).
3,not very happy,"I got this camera for Christmas, and I was initially happy with it. It is ok for basic pictures, but don't look for much beyond that. The flash lag is ridiculous, as the other reviews have said. Also, many of my pictures come out blurry. The battery life isn't that great either. I am getting more serious about photography and am now in the market for a new and better camera because this one is holding me back. I would only recommend it for beginners who need something easy to take basic pictures with."
2,decent enough if you're not asking for a lot,"this is an alright camera. if you're an average teen looking to post some hot pictures on myspace, or just someone looking to capture a few choice family moments, this camera should serve you fine.what i liked about it:1. it's compact, lightweight and easy enough to use2. pictures taken in daylight turn out pretty nice3. the battery life on this camera is much better than on other cameras i've usedwhat i disliked about it:1. it's a bit flimsy to be honest2. attempting to take a picture in the afternoon, evening or early morning is near impossible without it looking completely washed out or too dark. even though it has a night landscape option, it doesn't really work.3. the flash causes a horrible delay (but that's been mentioned like 9,000 times before)this is definitely not a camera for glamour shots. i'd also strongly discourage buying it if you're thinking of using it to take pictures at music events."
2,Below Average Camera for Nikon,"This camera does not do justice to the great Nikon brand name at all; I would argue this is a really more of a kid's camera. I have owned four digital cameras over the past four years; this one just does not cut it. The LCD pictures and resulting images are noisy (grainy) at low light levels; terrible picture quality. The delays in resetting after taking a picture, or the lengthy delays after taking flash photos, are intolerable. The price is cheap I give you that. But the Canon SD line, like the inexpensive SD200 I owned are a far better deal in terms of quality. Save your money and buy a Canon or Sony."
5,Is a good camera,"This is my first digital camera. I select this camera because the manufacturer and the price, It's small and take good pictures.I think that is a very good camera at a very good price."
4,Fine for what I bought them for,"I originally bought these gloves for use in a costume (Snake from Metal Gear Solid 3). I bought these gloves because of the look they had. The fingerless look seemed to match perfectly. These gloves are pretty comfortable. The craftsmanship definitely isn't the best (I used scissors to cut off loose leather and strings), but these aren't shabby. Plus, I ended up getting two pairs of gloves instead of one, so it was a very good deal. The shipping was on time as well."
4,Yu-Gi-Oh Connection,"The fingerless gloves are just like the ones Raphel wears in the cartoon. If you buy the Chaos Dual Disk, you should get these gloves too. The normal gloves are just an another reason to get this. Fingerless for duals;Normal for cold days"
2,US Centric - Not for Ex-Pats Living & Working at Country Ops,"Long time reviewer, first time critiquer. Enough to move me to take time out of my precious schedule to write. As an American living and working abroad for a US based pharmaceutical company, the working mother lifestyle is entirely different. The 100 Best Companies to Work only applies to the U.S. headquarters. The reality is different for the subsidiary or country operations, where resources are limited and the culture is not supportive of the ""flextime"" approach. In fact it is worst, because country operations are forced to ""nudge"" the books and offer what they call contractual permanent roles (not the equivalent as an employee role), which deprive the working mother of the necessary benefits needed to achieve a work-life balance. As an American living in Australia, I am appalled, if not dismayed by this severe discrepancy. For Ex-Pats living abroad, don't be fooled by the list."
2,Did I read the same book as you?,"This book does very little beyond re-articulating the theory, 'You, too, can do both- raise children and prosper at work, as long as you work 75 hours or more at your job'. Rise at 4 am to complete a task so that you can ""slip out early"" by 45 minutes? Stay up after the kids go to bed, editing your work product? Have a Family Team Plan (I forget the exact word the author uses)that can shuttle YOUR kids places? On site daycare? Paid maternity leave? Nannies? Sign me up. Come on, mothers. We deserve better. How about a book from a woman that REALLY did struggle, and her idea of solutions that work. Thankfully, I borrowed it from the local library, and haven't lost more than the two hour read I invested in it."
5,Great Brit Invasion Complialtion,I was looking for a Kinks album and my search produced this box set - I took a look at it and thought that I would give it a try as I didnt have alot of British Invasion Music but had always wanted to give it a try and add the best of it to my collection some day. I was NOT dissappointed! - I feel like an expert on the British Invasion period now - It has informational booklets with pics of all the bands included not in the least to say that the music is incrediable. I was yet to be born when alot of this happened but it was all laid out for me perfectly so I could understand the whole era. I went online to get one for my dad for Christmas. He had most of the stuff on vinyl but I got one so he could listen to it in the car. A great deal!
1,Couldn't get into it.,"The interplay between the characters from different cultures was difficult for me to get into. Their customs seemed contrived and somewhat silly for supposedly advanced space faring cultures. About a third of the way into this book, I realized I didn't care to finish it."
4,"Tasty-- great name,","But do I taste some artificial flavor in here? A little cream or vanilla Soy and maybe some sugar DOES mellow out what appears to be a slightly spiky note to the otherwise great flavor. However, this is something I can live with, as the overall taste, fresheness, aroma and quality of the coffee is very enjoyable."
5,A Dad's perspective,"My son got this as a present from his Nana. Boy does he love it! He's 20 months old and all he keeps asking for is to watch Buddy. He is now trying to put his own clothes on, all by himself. Definitely has this Dad's vote!"
3,"Oxford ALarge Print Dictionary,Thesaurus,and Wordpower Guide","This product is""okay""but not what I was really looking for.I am keeping it only because there may be a need for it by my daughter and son who are in college receiving higher degrees."
4,I like it quite a bit.,"As a record store employee, I hear many different complaints about many different albums. My least favorite complaint is ""I liked their _____ album better."" (whether it be first, last, or what have you). I don't see what there is not to like on ""Amazing Grace"". It's pure Spiritualized. Is it as good as ""Ladies and Gentlemen..."", of ""Let It Come Down""? I don't think so. But what does that matter? I like ""Dark Side of the Moon"" better than I like ""Animals"", but that doesn't mean that I wouldn't recomend ""Animals"" to anyone. ""Amazing Grace"" may not be as good as previous efforts, but there is enough good on the album to help it stand on its own. Spiritualized was 3/3 before I bought ""Amazing Grace."" Based on that, I took a chance, and now the Spaceman is 4/4."
3,Spiritualized - 'Amazing Grace' (Sanctuary Records),"Got to see the band out on this very tour. Some long time fans say that after this 'Amazing Grace', former Spacemen 3 founder Jason Pierce and company went downhill. Not sure if I would agree with that. This title does have it's moments. Tracks I liked were ""This Little Life Of Mine"", the ripping ""She Kissed Me (It Felt Like A Hit)"", ""Never Goin' Back"" and the ass-kicking ""Cheapster"". Only song this time around I didn't care for was ""Hold On"". Even the sappy ballad ""Lay It Down Slow"" is okay. Line-up: Jason Pierce - guitar, organ, piano, string arraingements & vocals, Doggen - bass, guitar & harmonica, John Coxon - autoharp, guitar & organ, Evan Parker - sax, Nicky Sweeney - violin and Jonny Aitken - drums. Not a bad effort from Spiritualized - but I like 'Lazer Guided Melodies'. 'Pure Phase' and 'Let It Come Down' better."
2,i feel sad too!,"i have to totally agree with stephen v.'s review of this album. more than half of this album just seemed as if they were leftover b-sides. not to mention the songs seem as if they were cut in half! they just sort of end three to four minutes in! i didn't have the highest expectations for this album, but you do expect more from a band who have had great albums in the past."
2,Feel So Sad...,"Neither amazing nor graceful... and a huge disappointment. ""Let It Come Down"" represented the pinnacle of the ever-expanding Spiritualized sonic universe... with ""Amazing Grace,"" Spaceman comes tumbling back down to earth. The epic, magical, narcotic grandeur that infuses all previous albums has vanished. In its place are disconnected ""tunes"" that are pale imitations of what has come before. Overall sounds like a demo album from a Spritualized cover band. ""Feel so sad."""
2,Amazing Grace,Amazing Grace being the 5th studio album and 2003 release was met with mixed reviews and with Allmusic giving it 3.5/5 and Rolling Stone give it 2/5. Compared to their earlier released and especially their 1997 release this is not nearly as good. The sound is more towards the generic rock sound with bland lyrics. No lyrics have been included in the booklet but a list of whom plays what. The photographs are quite nice. 2/5.
1,I can't believe it,"Yet again, I get my hopes up for the return of the Spiritualized that I once loved. But yet again, it was not to be... and believe me, I won't waste my money again. This disc and Let It Come Down are both AWFUL. And this is coming from somebody that really, really appreciated Laser Guided Melodies, Pure Phase, and Ladies and Gentlemen. I don't even know what Spaceman is doing anymore. This is not Spiritualized. He needs to call this ""band"" something else."
4,Keith Moerer is a retard,"We should be able to choose whether or not the editorial reviews are helpful, just like everyone elses. Gratuitous assertions such as ""OK Computer earned more acclaim, but Ladies and Gentlemen We Are Floating in Space is actually the better album""should be stated as opinion or taste but make for poor objective review of an album on it's own merits or lack thereof."
1,A great band continues its slide into mediocrity...,"Spacemen 3 and Spiritualized, the band formed by Jason Pierce after Spacemen 3 broke up, made some of the most amazing music of the last two decades. I strongly recommend that people browse through their catalogues - there are all sorts of worthwhile cds to be found. Sadly, the most recent Spiritualized cds have been bad - really bad. So bad that they are painful to listen to, especially for fans of the earlier music.I could go through ""Amazing Grace"" song by song, and even identify a few good moments - but why bother. If you are new to Spiritualized check out their earlier cds. The only thing interesting about this cd is whether or not it is as bad as the previous cd, ""Let it Pour Down"". If you are an old fan, pray that Pierce finds his second wind, and soon."
1,awful,Phenomenal? The only thing phenomenal about this album is how painful it is to listen to it. If you liked the first 3 albums then don't even walk near the aisle at the record store where this dog is or you may go into convulsions. I didn't think they could make an album worse than the last one but this is it. Run away!
1,"Careful, this is not music of Faith","From the Title of this work, one might be lead into thinking you're looking at modern worship music. Be warned this is nothing but a total misuse (abuse) of terms that out of sheer respect ought to be reserved for works of Faith. This CD has its fans, but unless you're a fan, you will, like a reviewer below, find it to be tormenting garbage."
4,Political Science,"This book gives great arguments on how our rights should be valued in our legal system and how they can be argued. I would recommend however that he fire his editor, there seems like there should be more to the book and a lot more arguments could be made from this book. I would still recommend this book for any theory law class, constitutional, philosophical or just as a good read for anyone who likes the discussion of peoples rights."
1,Tyranny of a minority,"Dworkin's thesis is that a tyranny of a minority is better than a tyranny of the majority. His argument is based on rigorous logic. But Justice Holmes observed that, ""The life of the law has not been logic, it has been experience."" Dworkin's theory is similar to those of Plato and Marx. But experience with the latters' theories has been negative. For an analysis of that experience, read Kark Popper's The Open Society and Its Enemies."
3,misleading title,"I have only read the first two chapters so far but mostly it is an attempt to discredit Justice John Marshall and his judicial review or judicial activism to cultivate individual rights or protect the common man from an abusive govt and the rich who have bought local and national politicians, with some nonsense about the priority of community or majority rules and principles. How dare the common man protest abuse by the majority!!! So much for freedom and the Bill of Rights. There is some suggestion that may redeem from the prospective that there maybe a better way to challenge injustice of the majority than use of judicial activism, but I haven't got that far yet."
1,Too slow,"This was not for me, the movements were too slow and I was bored w/in 10 minutes of putting the dvd in the player."
4,Will be good later,"I bought this as an alternative to my regular workouts. Reviews I read on other sites said this is a very basic beginning video with 10 core moves incorporated in many different dance sequences. This is true. However, there are two moves that involve lunging or knee bends in a way that I'm not comfortable doing. The mat workout is good as long as you have a thick pad to work on. I hope these DVDs will be of use to me later when I weigh less and I'm not worried about torquing my knees."
5,Great video for someone completely out of shape,"This video is very low impact and I was surprised when I began to sweat. It worked me but did not wear me down. I am not in good enough shape right now to say that I was energized but it felt good. Yes the lead talks too much but I found the cues very useful for this video. When I get the routine down I may just turn the volume on mute and use my ipod. However, for now I can anticipate a change in direction or pace and am not stumbling around like an idiot in my living room trying to re-capture the ""groove"" of the routine."
1,Boring!!!,"Deante DanceThis the most boring dance DVD I have ever done. The moves are repetitive and I can't see how they can possibly be effective. The music is light jazz which I am not fond of and it doesn't encourage one to get up and move. After doing one of the sessions and watching most of the others I threw this DVD away. (Yes, it's that bad). Try Yoga Booty Ballet instead."
5,great spiritual guide,Highly recommend to anyone interested in Christian spiritual growth. Dr Macchia drives home the beauty and joy that is available to anyone willing to learn the power of prayer. Had a profound effect on me.
4,VERY GOOD CONDITION,This book arrived in good time. It is in very good condition. There are just some notes written in the margins.
1,You've got to be kidding me,Earlier this year I paid less than half that price from Apple! they don't even make the 60 GB any longer. Major rip off!
1,WHY would you buy this?!,"Why would you pay $599 for a 60GB iPod video when you can get an 80GB newer model with a larger display for just $249, and for $100 more ($349) you can get a 160GB version?!!This is CRAZY!!"
3,good book,a good book for oral surgery but its got too much theory. A bit too much for a non North American dentist
5,Great Book,"This book is the best book on dog training I've seen sofar. The directions are clear, with very good pictures. The method is very dog and owner friendly. The introduction is very good, the explanations and the tips are very helpful. This is a great book, and I have recommended it to a couple of friends."
2,Definitely not easy on the eyes...,"Basically good information included, but the format was difficult to follow, and the type so small it was really hard to read."
5,This stuff works,"I've had chronic mild anemia with low energy for years, and taking these just every other day has given me more color to my face and more energy almost immediately. The only down side is the pills are abit large. Nice to find something that works, without any side effects. I did not have any GI irritation."
4,digestion,"I will have to be on this for more time to say whether it helps. I hope it will. First time I've ever been low on iron (incidentally, this is just after using Prilosec on and off for 3 months for a fairly new acid/ulcer problem). Sure do love Western medicine.In one week of use I can say it definitely does or can cause constipation, even in someone eating cereal with 50% daily fiber and normal meals with vegetables, apples for snacks, yogurt, etc.Get ready to counteract the potential effects in that arena. I didn't know that iron caused those problems, and would have appreciated a warning. Good luck and be well."
1,CELIAC,"Do not take this product if you have CELIAC disease - it will mess you up!!!! It has barley grass in it which is NOT GLUTEN FREE!!!!!!!!Nature's Plus - Hema-Plex, 30 tablets"
1,Be careful if gluten sensitive,"I am gluten sensitive and have to choose supplements that are labeled gluten free. I purchased this product because of its being ""gluten free"" and after taking it, had a terrible gluten reaction. I again took it a few days later to make sure it wasn't something else I had ingested with hidden gluten, and again I had the same allergic reaction. I read the label and it states that it has barley grass. There is a lot of debate as to whether those with gluten sensitivities can ingest barley grass or not. I can not so beware if you have a gluten allergy!"
1,Hema-Plex and Stomach Pain,"This product seem like the perfect supplement. When I take this product I get the worst stomach pain I had in my life, it feels like I am constipated but no signs of hardness in my poop. All my abdominal area is in pain, with gas. It almost feels like I have been food poison. I don't think I will be taken this anymore."
4,Good songs except for one........,"Over all this is a great CD if you like Waylon. Duh, why else would you be looking at this or thinking about buying it. I bought this CD just for one song specifically. James Hetfields cover of ""Outlaw Bit"". You can't buy individual tracks anywhere from this CD so I was forced to buy the whole thing. Anyway the rest of the CD turned out to be a pleasant suprise with really good takes on Waylons classic tunes. All except for the cover of ""Are You Sure Hank Done It This Way"" by John Mellencamp. Now in all fairness this is one of my favorite songs of all time so I may be a little overly critical of this particular cover but John just butchered it in my opinion.In this day of only buying specific tracks you like off of a cd, I was a little pissed about having to purchase and entire disk for one song but it turned out that I added a bunch of good songs to my collection."
2,Not the Heart and Soul of Waylon,"I am a second generation Waylon fan thanks to the love of his music from my father who has now passed. I was very dissapointed in the John Cougar version of ""are you sure Hank done it this away"" and I love John Cougar. Cougar adds a lot of flavor to his music but this was not his calling. Travis Tritt hit the nail on the head with his version, but lets face it Travis is a good ole'boy which Waylon was from the start. I was also dissapointed in Jessie Colter's version of ""Storms never last"" she of all people should know how to make a tribute to his music, after all they wrote and did that song together originally. I was very suprised that Kid Rock and Kenney Chesney did such a great verison. Bottom Line, this is not the heart and Soul of Waylon's music, but it was a nice attempt to remember one of the last great OUTLAWS."
1,Not a great tribute,"I was excited to get this CD- what a disappointment! Travis Tritt's ""Lonesome, On'ry, and Mean"" is good, as is Dwight Yoakum's ""Stop The World and Let Me Off""- James Hetfield's version of ""Don't You Think This Outlaw Bit's Done Got Out Of Hand"" is interesting in the way he varies the tempo- the rest is poor! We already have several versions of Jessi singing ""Storms Never Last""- why not pick a surprising song to sing? Alison Krauss' whispering version of ""You Asked Me To"" is weak- it just crawls along. Kenny Chesney's and Kid Rock's ""Luckenbach"" has too much chat- just sing the song, OK? Anyway, there's no point in buying this CD- you already have Waylon singing the definitive versions and these add nothing to them."
4,"great songs, great performances, but overproduced","waylon jennings wrote great songs and the performances on this tribute album all seem heartfelt and energetic. in particular, i liked the performances by ben harper, hank williams jr., and john mellencamp. If you like waylon jennings you should like most of this album. unfortunately, many of the recordings are way too nashville-slick (see travis tritt...) and this diminishes them and will be annoying to many waylon fans."
2,HOLD ON HERE...,"Before buying this outdated book you should be aware that Dr Mann, who is essentially the father of Western acupuncture (he treated me back in 1960-1) has recanted everything this book is about. He no longer believes that points or meridians exist. Read, rather, his Re-Inventing Acupuncture and skip this."
2,"Almost zero useful info, low quality","This ""atlas"" consists of three relatively large (about 2.5 feet) two-color pictures (front view, rear view, side view): bones and muscles drawn in reddish orange color, and the meridian lines in black. The points are shown against the bones and against the muscles.I personally found nothing that I haven't already seen in most any other book. The quality of these three pictures (IMHO) is very poor, among the poorest I've seen, only larger. No matter how many books on this subject you can afford to have, this one isn't likely to serve you much (IMHO)."
5,A must read!!!!,"This book blew me away. I had never heard of DSS, never knew the State Department had a force of special agents keeping diplomats safe, embassies secure, and investigating passport and visa fraud. Never knew that these men and women have tracked down some of the world's most dangerous terrorists at outposts all over the planet.This book is written like a spy novel in setting mood, tension, danger and thrills. The narrative is crisp and enlightening, from the story of al-Qaeda's first batch of visitors to the US to the hunt for fugitives in Southeast Asia, Pakistan, Yemen and beyond. The chapters on the arrest of Ramzi Yousef are page-turners that will keep you at the edge of your seat. The chapters on the embassy bombings are sad and frightening.I couldn't put this book down. I look forward to Katz's next book. Buy this book immediately!"
5,Will spoil you for other music of its kind!,"Since I first heard this CD 2 weeks ago I have been searching in vain for something that comes close to comparing. The music is so viscreal its difficult to put it into words. It speaks to something so deep inside of me, so primal, that I can't help moving my body and chanting along to words I don't even know. A must have!"
5,Connecting With our Past and our World,"When I bought this CD I said cool Australian music. But When I heard it I was like WOW!! it was ten times better than I expected. Nomad combines the Australian aborigoanl sounds with our very own Native American sounds. The songs I like best are ""Wildlife"", ""Gathering"", and ""Trading Ground"". The first one is a didjereedo only track that is just awsome. The gathering made me feel in an collective mood like i was part of the whole world singing to this song. and the last one trading ground is the best beacuse it combines the East and the West. I loved the chants and the singing especially in ""Tracking"" and ""Follow the Sun"" :>"
2,Don't let this one lousy book put you off Robinson,Peter Robinson has turned into a first-rate mystery writer. But he certainly wasn't when he wrote this in 1989. No amount of gorgeous Yorkshire scenery can make up for an uninteresting cast of one-dimensional characters and an abrupt. out-of-left-field ending. Skip this atypical entry and read his later Inspector Banks books --they're first rate and well deserving of all the acclaim and slew of awards he's won. This isn't.
3,Typical Robinson Mystery,"...And by that I don't mean that typical is bad. This is a good book, just average for Robinson. It unfolds in typical manner -- a body is found, a bunch of people at the local pub are all suspects, the killer aint who you think it is... etc. Robinson patiently unfolds his stories and gives us well-developed characters. His books are a delight to read. Though not his best, this is a worthy book."
4,Should be read by males and females of all ages,"Any sex education class should have this book as required reading. Teenagers, their parents, pregnant women and their husbands, as well as menopausal women and their families will find this helpful."
4,The Female Brain finally explained,"Brizendine explains clearly, often with humor and always with compassion, how girls become women and the many changes they go through as their brains develop. She also makes a comparison with boy's and men's brains, which can be very helpful. In the examples she uses, one sees that men and women are indeed different and why they sometimes have difficulty with one another. In appreciating these differences people can have better relationships. I'm now eager to read Brizendine's book on the Male Brain."
1,Unnecessary bias wrecks the effort,"I admit I only made it through 30 pages of this book which my wife loved and really wanted me to read. I found the tone regarding men offensive to the degree of which the author lost credibility in my mind. I understand from the reviews that the first third of the book is that way. I have no problem with an author trying to teach and have fun at some expense of men, but I could not get past the stereotyping - and don't expect your man to share the same experience from the book. Perhaps I will give the later chapters a try and ignore the errors noted in these valuable reviews. But I give it one-star for wrecking what could have been a helpful dialogue."
2,Interesting read,"I found the book interesting from the standpoint of the infinite emotional fluxuation women seem to deal with explained scientifically. As a man I have always wanted a woman, devoid of feminism and emotion to try to explain why women act the way they do. That is not to say that I feel superior, I have always just been facinated by the ""differences"" in how men and women think and how women approach issues, problems, and joys differently than men. I have been married to the same woman for over 35 years, and have had a constant, close companion as a study.This book however, and is the reason for the low rating, is really just a modern version of the feminist movement of the 60's. Move on already ...It is worth reading, but if you are a man, be prepaired to be exposed to an image of men dragging their knuckles and drool running from the corner of their mouths.Brain envy ... hardly!"
5,"""The Female Brain, and the female it controls""","Recently purchased, ""The Female Brain"", and wished it was required reading in high-school or college, since the author is aneuro-psychiatrist, and tells us the difference genetically, between the male and female brains, and tells us how the female brain develops, a bit differently than the male brain develops from birth, child-hood, teen years, and the rest of the living life of the female. If males, such as fathers, brothers, husbands, boyfriends, etc., want to know a great deal more about a female, and what she is all about, and the brain that controls her, they should read this fun and educational book.Stuart, Chicago, Illinois, May 15, 2010."
1,female brain & body,"This book is very interessant. When I read this book I was very happy how much new informations about womens I can know... But this book has a little no strong sites. First: this book wrote women and we can ask: why women must good know what is female brain? Women need man, man need women -and therefore maybe man/boy know better how funktioniert women brain & body."
3,alright I guess,"This book was alright but it seems more based on personal views of the author and much less on science. It wasn't the worst book I ever read, but not the best either."
3,Interesting book,"Still reading this one. It's got good information and should be read by everyone over the age of 14. If you want a better understanding of your girlfriend, wife, daughter, or yourself, this is a good place to start."
1,"File in Fiction, not Science.","The problem with this book is that Brizendine actively misrepresents research and uses numbers that are basically made-up. Her ""science"" doesn't stand up to scrutiny.For instance, on differences between male and female speech patterns she claims that women speak three times more words than men in a day, and speak almost twice as fast. In fact, no reliable studies had been done when the book came out. Prompted by the book, somebody actually bothered to measure, and it turned out that men and women speak about the same number of words, and men speak (very slightly) faster. You can get details about the studies from the excellent blog LanguageLog, which reports on real linguistic science. Google for the post titled ""Gabby guys: the effect size"".In sum: This book should be filed in the Fiction section, not the Science section."
3,Not a Scientist,"I am not a scientist, researcher , or doctor and therefore can't comment on the extensive reviews done by those in the clinical fields; however, I can comment on the use of ""cutesy"" language and the ""dumbing"" down approach to the female brain. How much research is being done on the ethereal energy that separates male and female? Maybe I'm too ""new age"" or alternative-minded, but I've learned alot more about gender differences, male and female energy, female brains and reactions from Deepak Chopra, Rayna Gangi and Andrew Weil than I did from this fairly bad attempt."
5,Just WOW,"I picked up this book after perusing the reviews and was definately not disappointed. If you are a woman, know a woman, or want to know a woman, then pick up this book and read it...cover to cover. For women, it will be a journey of self-discovery and enlightenment. For those who know women, it will shed some light on our daily struggles and ""mood swings"". For those who want to know a woman, this book will reveal us in all our complexity, simplicity, strength, and weakness. I can't give it enough stars!!!"
4,Informative,"I bought this book a few years ago when I entered a perimenopausal state, and have just reread it as am dealing with my 16 year old daughter's 'classic' teenage stage! Very easy to read, informative, this book guides you thru a woman's life which is nothing if not hormonal. Definitely recommend."
2,disappointing,This comes across as a not too cleverly disguised promotional piece for hormone therapy. Save your money.
5,If you ever wondered,"This book is the best. The author presents the information in such a readable and delightful way that you don't want to put it down. It is technical, serious and humorous all at the same time. I haven't been able to quit recommending this book to, well almost everyone I meet. Not only have I given it to my daughters, I recommend to all the males that ever wondered how women think."
2,Disappointing...,"Other critical reviews have done a good job in rebutting a lot of what is in the book, so I will not go into a lot of detail. But as a male reader, I found much of the book to be biased, unscientific, and nonobjective. The author seems to have written a book to ""preach to the choir"" -- a book written for women so they can feel good about their way of thinking and their emotions, and feel superior to the poor men with their less advanced brains, apparently good for nothing but sex and aggression, according to the book. I am a scientist, although not in the medical profession, and I found much of the author's reasoning unconvincing, relying mostly on anecdotes, with only rather hand-wavy arguments to draw questionable conclusions from observations."
1,Awful book full of inaccuracies and jumping into irrational conlcusions,"I had to buy this book for a Counseling class and it was disappointing. In a world where Dr. Phil is a psychology guru, I'm not impressed that this book was a best seller. Nevertheless, best seller does not mean accurate book. It just makes a good work at captivating the general public. However, it fills people with misinformation and beliefs, not facts.The moment I started reading I was pretty sceptical. Being a graduate student in Clinical Psychology pays off! I quickly started observing severe mistakes in the conclusions the author describes based on my background in Neurological Assessment, Psychobiology, Molecular Biology, Social Psychology, and many other Psychology classes. Then I started reading reviews made by Ph.D.'s in the field of Psychology and felt glad that someone else was disproving several claims and pointing out some fallacies and mistakes.Definitely a bad product."
3,Good for the non-professional,"For people without a background in psychological or neurological research, this is a wonderfully accessible read. The narrative is presented in a linear form, from infant to elderly. The emphasis, to me, appeared to be on the reproductive and menopausal periods, but that was fine with me, because of the group I identify with. What is truly the meat of the book, as far as I'm concerned, is the extensive reference section - if you are in to looking at specicfic studies, this is a terrific road map to guide you to many interesting places."
2,Disappointed,"I would have given this another star or two if I hadn't heard something about it on NPR tonight. A linguist from UC Berkeley ripped the book, saying the author's various claims, eg women use three times as many words a day as men, that they talk faster...are simply not true. The first claim, for example, was supposedly taken from a book by a self-help guru, who apparently just made it up. The linguist (can't recall name) claims the opposite is true for both these claims; men use more words than women and also speak slightly faster. The author's factoids are easily accepted because they agree with our prejudices. He goes on to dispute Brizendine's claims in other areas as well.If true, this is disturbing. It assumes either ignorance or dishonesty. Either is not something one would expect from someone who portrays herself as an expert."
4,Stimulating Reading,"""The Female Brain"" applies science to the concept that men are from Mars and women from Venus. Sex specific behavior that has been recognized for centuries is explained from a biological/neurological standpoint. It is particularly interesting because neuropsychiatrists can now examine the brain in ways that were never possible before. But the author has been accused of being sloppy in some of her research, which is a shame. So much in here is worthwile, I hate to see the well supported concepts loose credibility. Despite the criticism, it's a real eye-opener with some solid research reflected in the extensive bibliography."
1,What SHE said,"Before spending money or time on this book, google ""psychoneuroindoctrinology"" and read a critical review that appeared in Nature. Sometimes, it's not enough to have credentials."
5,Great read,"This is a very interesting book, written by a psychiatrist. She provides a great account of the female brain throughout the life course from a neurochemical prospective. Recommended for women of all ages."
3,"Educational, though too much over-simplification","Having spent many years studying human psychology in both an academic setting and practical, hands-on settings, I can say that there is some value in this book. That said, I think it makes vast conclusions that are not so useful. For example, no one could seriously argue that there are a few general differences between men and women in, for example, what they find attractive in the opposite sex. (That's why you don't see men wearing lipstick in order to draw in the ladies.) However, in some many areas she seems to have a very black and white point of view. Women are like this, while men are like that, individual variabilities be damned. In fact in the real world there is no reason why women can't be math or philisophical geniuses (and indeed many are). There's no reason why men can't be nuturing, and again many are. I recommend the works of Deborah Tannen as being better scholarship and research."
4,female brain,"Excellent book, written based on research findings, author is witty and writes with flair and knowledge. The information clears up many questions and noticed differences between the thinking patterns and behavior between male and females. This book is very interesting, both men and women should read and will find benefit in this book. The content also supplies hours of content for converations between readers."
4,Let the men read this one!,"This book was recommended to me by a man with two daughters. It may have saved his sanity as his daughters are in their early teens. He can understand what hormones are doing to his ""little darlings"" but, he can't stop it. Poor guy. I gave one to my 30 something daughter and she loves it. Very good reading but really only one doctor's report on studies she has done over 20 years."
1,waste of money,"I am an owner of three previous releases of the Ultra Dance series - and I do like them a lot.This one is major disappointment. It's not even supposed to be in this series - just does not stand up to the level of previous releases. Very plain, lower tempo, if you know what I mean.Bottom line - I very much regret buying it."
3,1st cd sucks 2nd cd is HOTTTT,like i said the 1st cd sucks!! very boring! i cant stop listening to the 2nd cd though! i give the 2nd cd 5 stars though!
4,Great CD !!!!,"This CD is great, I don't know why people say it sucks. It is one of Louies best. great songs that are hitting the clubs here in Puerto Rico and everyone that I know listens to Louie De vitto.I recommend it to anyone who likes ultimate dance songs. Great for working out too."
1,What happened to Louie?!,"Listen... i dont know why they put the 5 star reviews up front (probaly to make him look good and cause they problay wrote reviews first) but if you ACTUALLY listen to this type of music, this cd really IS an insult. If you think Sandstorm is the greatest thing ever made, then YOUR an insult to us listeners. The First Dance cd i ever bought was infact a Louie Devito CD. NYC Underground 3. I LOVED IT! Me and my friends worshipped that CD and couldnt wait till NYC 4 cameout. But as time went on and we really got into dance music... we figured out that Devito just takes the top hits from ANY category and crams them onto a CD. I mean common!... Stacie Orrico!??! Then people who only hear these songs in clubs or on the radio think hes the king because hes got them on his CD. Do yourself a favor and DONT follow CD stores 1-10 top hits concerning Dance, techno, trance and so on. Oh yeah.. and dont buy the cd. its sad."
4,A bit disappointing,I have the first 3 Ultra Dance sets and they are awesome. I also have several Louie DeVito CD's. He generally chooses good music but does not mix them well. This CD was the opposite: decent mixing but the raw material was not that great. The first 3 Ultra Dance CD's are much better.
4,Good Exiles with some shaky issues...,"this was a goodTPB. The battle with Hyperion was great and it was fitting for Magik to go out the way she did. Looking back at this book after reading the whole ""no time broker, just time breakers"" stuff, it doesn't really make sense for the bugs to have the heroes fight each other to the death since they could simply have had the time broker appear and tell them that they have completed their last mission and sent them home. If they wanted Hyperion to die they could have scoured the multiverse to find the biggest, baddest fighters to handle him. But forgetting all of that, it was still very enjoyable. Hyperion makes a great foil."
4,solid goa,"psy trance producer dustin saalfield's second full length album. quality, old-school goa and psy with some uplifting elements.for the psy-heads: this is pretty accessible, somewhat melodic, straightforward.for those who have never heard of psy or goa: it's a fast paced, warp-your-mind, twist-your-senses thrill ride of electronic music. don't call it techno. other prominent artists in the genre include astral projection, hallucinogen, infected mushroom."
4,Powerful events,"Never really following or understanding this historical event, I chose this book to give me clear information. I would recommend this for anyone interested in obtaining factorial information into the Hoffa case."
3,I Heard you paint Houses,"I have read the book called THE TEAMSTERS, I thought it was well written,Then I read the book titled I HEARD YOU PAINT HOUSES, to my thinking not quite as good, to much repeating of the same lines and a whole lot dragout to get to the point"
4,I heard you paint houses,"Very insightful, with a nice link between the ""alleged mob"" and the Nixon white house. The writer mixes the first person narrative with his ""inserts"" to expand on what other important events were happening at the time. Very well written."
5,Plain and simple: Now I know.,"I've always been a fan of the 60s and especially interested in all things Kennedys. So I naturally developed an interest in Jimmy Hoffa, and I always wondered if I'd ever find out exactly what happened during his final moments. After reading this book I'm convinced that Sheeran's story is 100% true, and now I know how Hoffa met his end. A must read for any 60s fan, conspiracy theory fan, mafia literature fan, or any combination thereof."
4,Terrific and nostaligic,"Solves a mystery, and it's distant enough in time to be fascinating without seeming horrifying. It's basically a narrative confession, and it rings entirely true. Feels true. I was almost more fascinated by the flavors of the time, the cultural aspects of mob life in the ""old days."" Can you trust this account? Maybe not entirely, since at times the story seems so full of pride and bluster, and surely there's some exaggeration, but it does read like non-fiction, not fiction. Genuinely hard to put down."
3,"interesting in spots, but disjointed","I read this book with great anticipation. I love Mob books, and Hoffa is an interesting topic. Unfortunately, the book's style leaves a lot to be desired. Frank Sheeran's words are interspaced with the author's, and the effect is choppy. In addition, Sheeran's admissions are frequently couched in slang, making it a bit hard to follow. While we finally all wait for the punchline (Who shot Jimmy Hoffa), I am almost at the point of saying, ""who cares""?However, the book does go into several interesting revelations about John Mitchell, Joe Biden, and Robert Kennedy. If you like Mob books, or are interested in a prospective on Jimmy Hoffa from a man who worked for him, try this book. Unfortunately, it's not a ""hard to put down"", but rather, a somewhat interesting book."
5,review,An absolute must read for anyone who is even remotely interested in the Jimmy Hoffa story. A great narrative that makes you read as fast as you can. Highly recommended. It answers many questions in a very convincing way.
4,House review,"Pretty riveting story but I liked the fact that the story was based upon actual interrogations. Book was a little long, but still really interesting!"
4,I Heard You Paint Houses,"This was a very interesting book about Jimmy Hoffa rising to power in the Teamsters'Union,some of the friends and enemies he made along the way,and the government and the Kennedys efforts to take him from power.Also his last meeting and ""last ride"" leading to his subsequent disappearance,in which his body was never found."
4,Credible,"I've done a lot of reading about the disappearance of Jimmy Hoffa and even wrote an article on the subject for CrimeLibrary.com. Mob associate Frank ""The Irishman"" Sheeran told author Charles Brandt that he was the triggerman who killed Hoffa and details the plot to get the labor leader and dispose of the body. Many theories have been kited over the years, a lot of them pretty far-fetched. Sheeran's version is probably the most plausible and given that he was immediately fingered as a suspect after Hoffa went missing, I'd say it's the most credible. Brandt quotes Sheeran at length, and while the man's tales aren't polished, they do have the distinct ring of authenticity. This book might not be the complete story of Hoffa's demise--and we might never know all the details--but it's well worth reading and essential for a complete understanding of Hoffa's complicated relationship with the Mafia."
2,This is not my favorite,"My father has alzheimer, colon cancer and parkinson diseases. We have been used this product especially colon cancer, but that made an interaction with other parkinson and alzheimer products. Therefore, we leaved from this product. But I must be said that our case is a special one."
1,Peep O,"I've been a fan of Elmore Leonard for years but this book will cause me to think twice before ordering another of his books in the future. In fact, this book was such a disappointment that I got only about a third of the way before quitting, and I rarely quit a book."
1,Tedious,"This was written in 2003 yet there are only 14 reviews on Amazon? I gave this a try because of the positive reviews, but I found the characters flat, unbelievable, and boring, after and initial infatuation with them(about half way through the book). It was tough to finish and the ending? Was there one? This is the second Leonard book I've read and both were disappointing, and I was counting on him to keep my train ride short."
4,A thriller master for modern times,As good as most of his books. One of the best modern classics around.
5,Leonard's most overlooked.,"When you get caught up reading a writer's work there's always one selection that always stands out. CAT CHASER is mine. The characters, the dialogue, the location (you can see where he got Cuba Libre from) all fit together like a favorite quilt you just can't get rid of. It's the hero who decides it's time to do it one more time. Maybe not for the woman, but just out of curosity. A plot worth reading and a hero as cool as LaBrava or Chili Palmer."
4,the usual Elmore Leomard competence...,"For fans for Elmore Leonard you already know he writes tight crime novels often strewn with humour and great characters. And despite being largely formulaic in approach (..his lead characters all seem to be the same) he succeeds in entertaining the reader. And the same holds true with 'Cat Chaser'.With 'Cat Chaser' we have an ex-military guy in south Florida involved doing hanky-panky with the wife of a former monster from a Carribean country (Dominican Republic) before the Americans kicked him out. The outcome is inevitable but along the way we meet strange characters (the usual Miami oddballs, and a few imports from the Dominican Republic) who do some very strange things. While here are also a good number of funny bits Leonard is no match for the Florida comic crime novel master Carl Hiaasen.Bottom line: a fun if not enthralling Elmore Leonard venture. Fans will rejoice."
5,Satan Revealed,"Most of us know that Satan is the enemy and has no good intent for anyone. In this work Chafer exposes Satan in a manner that is very provocative, very telling. Chafer takes us inside the mind of Satan (as best mortal man can get there), thus revealing in a very lucid manner both the motives and methods used to keep individuals in a state of spiritual darkness, and the power and intent of his battle plan to attack Christians. Knowing these things with a deeper, more intense understanding only prepares us to fight the good fight, keep the faith, and to finish our course in our service to Jesus Christ, our Lord, our Savior. It goes without saying that this book is a must for any serious Bible student!"
2,Too Low in Protein,"The variety pack has three varieties that are all only 10 or 11 grams of protein each, with a whopping 24 grams of sugar. The blend is a basic recipe that they then flavor with various ingredients, like peanut butter or chocolate chips. The mixture is tasty and is a chewy crunchy blend of organic ingredients. But alas the protein count is way too low, and the sugar way too high."
1,Watch the expiration date!,"I had been getting this mixed box with subscribe & save for some time. Seems to be the only mixed selection available. Sometimes it seemed that the bars weren't as fresh as should be, so I started checking the expiration dates. My LAST shipment, which I returned, was already a couple of months past the expiration date when it arrived. Very disappointing!"
4,Tasty and filling snack bars - Review for the Variety Pack,"Always looking to have an assortment of snack bars and packs available for my family and myself I picked up theClif Bar Energy Bars, Variety Pack of Chocolate Chip, Crunchy Peanut Butter, and Chocolate Chip Peanut Crunch, 2.4-Ounce Bars (Pack of 24)which contained 8 of each bar.The size of these bars is just what I wanted. Big enough to fill you up and give you energy for a short time and not so small that you feel like your getting short changed. As for the flavors? I have a preference for anything peanut butter so I liked the crunchy peanut butter best, but I also liked the other two so I can say I liked them all.The price can get a bit high on these. I tend to either wait for a sale here on Amazon or in my local grocery store before buying."
5,Clif Bar Energy Bars Variety Pack,"Clif Bars provide the needed energy to keep you going when (and before) the energy from your meal runs out. I play golf almost every day and meal times tend to occur during a round. Rather than stop at the turn to get a sandwich, I eat a Clif bar and press on. They are satisfying both flavorwise and from an energy replenishment perspective. They don't melt in the heat and are very convenient to keep in the bag. I first tried Clif bars after an off road bicyclist friend told me about them. The price on Amazon is good (not great) but still much cheaper than buying them at the grocery store. I recommend them to anyone that needs an energy boost in the middle of something that cannot be stopped."
3,review,"Not a bad product, but not exactly my choice of noursishment. Item is too chewy, but filling."
5,Great healthy snack,"Great anytime..breakfast, midnite...on the go..larger than similarly priced brands..tastes too good to be healthy, but it better be as advertised cause I eat so many of them!!!"
3,Get the builder bars...,"I ordered this variety pack after first having a box of Cookies 'n Cream builders bars. I thought that they were just Clif Bars, but apparently the builders bars are different: more protein, and more of a candy bar shape (these ""bars"" are almost nugget shaped).Beyond just the look, the bars themselves are quite different in texture. I *greatly* prefer the builders bars, to such an extent that I may try to give away the remainder of this box (I've only eaten 2 bars) and just order another box of builders bars. These bars do not look good, and though they taste alright, the texture is a big turn off for me..."
1,Eat at your own risk! Buyer beware!,"I am sitting here on the toilet writing this review, with the worst stomach pain I have ever had..... I usually have a cliff bar in the morning when I'm running late for work, they taste great and usually do not give me any problems. Until this morning... I woke up had some coffee and a cliff bar, went out to mow my lawn and not even 20min later I had to stop due to excruciating stomach pains.. I am not alérgic to any ingredients in the various and verified that it was completely sealed before opening.. Luckily for me it's Saturday and I go not have to go to work... Buyer be ware! ! Quality control has gone way down and I may have to go to the hospital due to the pain.... FU CLIFF BAR!"
2,Good energy bar,"I purchased the variety pack of Clif bars. The bars were all very fresh and tasted pretty good. Clif bars are good because since they keep you full for a long time. They are good for hiking, biking, or to keep handy as a meal in a pinch."
5,Yummy!,I began buying this product when my husband needed something that was gluten-free. My husband takes them with him when he traveling to tide him over until a meal. I eat one with a glass of milk and they are very filling. It is dense but I liken it to a giant cookie that has a lot less grams of fat than a cookie would. I highly recommend them for kids too!
2,"Good the first 2 times, but not the next 22 times","I bought the 2 pack (24 bars) of the cran apple cherry. It tasted good at first because it was new. But after a few times it got kind of dull, then just unappealing. Eating 24 bars in the same flavor got way too boring, it took me over 3 months to finish everything. I would suggest going to safeway or walgreens to pick up a single bar and try it out before you commit to 2 boxes."
3,Non Organic Soy Overpriced,"These energy bars are tasty and handy, but they have two issues. The first is that they contain non-organic soy (hexane). The second is that you can find them for 99 cents each at Harmon Drugs and other discount stores."
1,"Not good taste, A good chef knows looks are important","These bars don't taste that good. There look is AWFUL, and they leave you thirsty- maybe not a good thing when you are in the trail and don't have much water at hand."
1,SUGAR!!!,"""Organic"" doesn't mean healthy. There is A LOT OF SUGAR in these. Had I known, I would never have bought them."
4,Yummy,"Still somewhat sweet, but less sweet than other bars. This bar was suggested to me by my cyclist friends who swear by it. It has enough protein for me and the taste isn't too bad."
4,"on the sweet side, but taste good!","If you look at the nutrition info its only 20g of sugar per bar, but they taste really sweet. I have to have them with water always. Other than that, they are delicious!! Would recommend++++"
5,Great Snack!,These are the best bars for before ou after a workout and they taste great. My 20 month old loves them too!
4,"""Ghetto Falsehoods drips with brutal honesty...""","Coco and da Crew are hot. Young girls from the hood with talent are about to make their big break when a series of events changes their lives. Tough, tomboy Coco has the voice and the moves. Danielle - pretty and boy crazy, and Josephine - the peacemaker, middleclass girl tryin to chill wit her homies. Enter Dee Dee. Trying to fit in and ""be down"" she ""borrows"" her uncle's mercedes to hang with Coco and da Crew. A night of unexpected violence and terror builds a bond for the girls. Bent on revenge, Dee Dee's uncle plots to destroy the animals that attacked his niece. But the real breakout characters are the vicious catalysts Vulcha and Lil Long. Brandishing enuf ammo for a small army, these two tear through their neighborhood extinguishing their own twisted sense of justice... hmmm...music, party life, sex, drugs, violence... sounds like a potential script..."
3,k-pow!,"This all girl band are pretty respectable. There is a certain novelty in that they are a girl band but they show that they are more than capable of a heavy, brutal sound. They're easily likened to Walls of Jericho for obvious reasons and while this isn't incorrect they offer a different enough sound to be fresh from them. For any Most Precious Blood fans, Rachel (the bassist come guitarist) plays guitar in this band. Don't expect anything amazing but it's a good add to a music collection."
1,Perhaps the worst book on philosophy to be written in 1996.,"This book has nothing good to offer a student of philosophy. The only exception may be a sense of how not to do philosophy. Reiman, in several chapters ""responds"" to various attacks on western liberalism. In each of these, instead of outlining the actual arguements against liberalism, he changes them into something else and ""refutes"" them thus. In logic it's called a straw man. By anyone's definition, this is bad philosophy. Furthermore, he has a very poor understanding of many philosophers he uses in this book. Really just and awful book."
4,Aftermath of the end of the war for the Japanese citizen.a viewpoint,"We have heard the stories what it was like here after the war against the Japanese but seldom, if ever, do we get to have a peek into the society and the day to day life of the defeated Japanese, the average person as they try to continue with their lives interrupted by the war and the destruction of both their social and physical strutures. This movie was made at the time depicted and within the structure of the Allied censorship so there is no anti-Americanism but the anger for the defeated Japanese military imperalism is clearly just below the surface. This film was intended to rally the people to keep moving forward towards a better day. I rated this 4/5 stars only because it was made during a period of censorship and ""stuff"" had to be left out. It would otherwise rate a easy ""5"" stars."
2,Not all hardwood,"I thought I was getting an all hardwood rack but only the stem holders are oak, the rest is pine. When you stain it to match surrounding cabinents the contrast is apparent."
5,Much nicer than the photo,"This was excellent for the price. I bought two to put in our cabinet. I had to trim them but It fit all of my stemware without a problem: chuncky margarita glasses, wine glasses, champane flutes everything. I almost bought one from pottery barn that was a shelf with stemware holder underneath for $100. I am so glad I didn't. I painted the stemware racks white and my kitchen shelf white, and screwed them together. It looks awesome."
5,Great way to store stemware,I stained this stemware rack to match my existing wall unit and installed it under one of the shelves. Installation was easy with 4 screws and this is definitely one of the best way to store your stemware. I prefer this rack over the metal ones since the stemware glides in with less friction.
4,good basic wine rack,I ordered this item to mount to my ceiling above my cabinets for wine glasses. This is a great solution for basic glass holding. The only thing I didn't like is that the holes in the rack aren't spaced 16 on center to hit the ceiling joists. I put cross members in the attic to support it in case the glasses added an excessive amount of weight on the rack and it worked perfectly. The rack is also bare wood which was perfect because I stained it to match my cabinets. I can see where this would also be a good product for under cabinet mounting.
5,Awesome!,"Exactly what I needed. Holds a full 18 glasses. I mounted under one of my cabinets, and had no problems installing.=)"
5,Great product,"The stemware rack was sturdy and attractive. I'm very pleased with it. In my particular situation, I had to add a piece of wood behind it so the glasses wouldn't just keep going."
3,nice... but needed modifications,"We bought this rack hoping to hang from a low ceiling over our bar. But the holes to mount it are not on 16 inch centers (to hit the ceiling studs)and I felt with the added weight of glasses, drywall anchors would not hold. The last thing I wanted was for the whole thing to crash down full of glasses. So, I added a couple pieces of wooden brackets to support it and finished the whole thing to match. I was able to set 3 inch wood screws, so I know it is not going to fall anytime soon. My wife is pleased, but I have more effort into it than I anticipated. If you want to hang this from inside a cabinet, watch your screw length. But do not plan on hanging from a dry-walled ceiling without modifying."
5,American made stemware rack,"I stained this and mounted it under the top cabinets of a dining room hutch, in our townhouse, where we are so short of space. I used an end grain sealant because it's the rack ends that you look at. Holds our wine glasses of all different sizes nicely, and it's Made in USA, which is not easy to find these days."
5,great product,I purchased the stemware rack for under my cabinet and just love it. I put a light stain on it to match my hickory cabinets and I've gotten so many complements. Definitely worth the money. I would highly recommend it.
3,Nice.,"Installs easily. Accepts some wood stain. Has no ""back"" to keep glasses from dropping out backwards. Careful !"
4,sturdy and easy to install,"I did have to re-drill the holes for the install screws to fit the beam on our kitchen ceiling, but other than that it was a cinch! we've gotten compliments on it."
3,"Nice quality, but...","I bought this to house my husband's Riedel collection. It is a decent quality rack using glue and screw to hold the rack together, and is made of high quality maple. The only negative is that it won't fit the base of the Vinum Extreme Pinot Glasses."
1,Wrong color,"The image on the website is of a chrome soap dispenser. The shipped dispenser color looks like a cross between brushed nickel and bronze, yet Plumbers Surplus insists the website image is accurate. Caveat emptor, you get what you pay for."
1,Awful product,"I tried Fanci-full Rinse ""Black Rage"" to try and turn my hair black for Halloween. I followed the directions on the bottle, which stated that I was to put the product on towel damp hair. They recommend that you use gloves, which they do not provide. The product splattered all over my bathroom and all over me. I finished the rinse as per the instructions, and attempted to dry my hair. The product made it extremely difficult to dry my hair, resulting in tangles and knots. Also, Fanci-full advertises that you can ""try a new hair color for a day"". Well, the color I ended up with was anything but black. It dyed my light brown hair a slightly darker brown, and gave me absolutely awful texture. I DO NOT recommend this product."
2,Nice features but poor quality,"Even though the box clearly states that this 2.4Ghz phone is ""802.11 Friendly"", I seem to get interface on this phone anywhere in my home. This is the first 2.4Ghz phone that I've had this problem with. There is no option to switch channels (DSS). There is a constant buzz on the line.Another absolutely irritating thing is that fact that the dialpad is soo slow and will often miss a number when you dial it in."
2,Seems great--but...,"I was really pleased with the base/speaker phone when I purchased the original unit. Usually people cannot tell when I am on the handset or the base speakerphone because of the excellent sound quality. But the reason we purchased this unit was to be able to add additional handsets. The sound quality from the second handset is extremely poor. Moreover, sometimes when both handsets are in use that seems to cause both handsets to lose contact with the base and the call is lost.I don't want any special features on my phone, other than multiple handsets. This phone seems to have a lot of neat futures. If I had designed this, however, I would have dropped some of the features and designed a system which allows the person with whom you are talking to actually understand what you are saying. Maybe you need to buy a more expensive model to get that particular feature."
1,Crappy Phone,I had the phone for 2 weeks and it quit charging. I had to send the phone back to the manufacturer.
3,Works ok,"The phone its self works alright, but dies VERY QUICK. Leave it off the base for a half hour and its flashing low battery, leave the phone some place for a few hours and its dead to the point that the ""page"" feature doesnt even help you find it.It never comes off the base longer than the lenght of a phone call so it works fine for me. Do not purchase for everyday frequent use."
1,Junk phone... don't waste your money,This is the most aweful phone i ever purchased . i purchased it for 20$ thinking it was cheap with all the caller-id and speaker phone facilities. Don't waste your money on this. There are other Vtech phones which you can get below 10$ and are still far better than this hi-fi model. Looks great but... works worst!You can actually spend the same amount of money to get a nice panasonic reliable phone.THIS PHONE'S HEAD SET STOPPED WORKING IN 3 MONTHS...Keep away from it!
1,"Big title, little content","This is a fast read, but that's not a positive review for a book that is tackling a pretty heavy topic. It comes across as the writer's ramblings on his own path to starting his own business. He never actually guides you through any process that's going to lead to a greater awareness or understanding of your own at the end. He doesn't even explain his own process with enough detail to glean anything by observation. The hard part about what he describes is not going out a starting a business, but rather discovering what type of business is a good match for who you really are, what your talents are. He completely leaves that process of self-discovery a mystery, besides a passing reference to therapy. It was worth the hour I spent with it, just to get my mind thinking about some points he raises, but I would not suggest buying this book."
5,Simply wonderful!!!!,"This book was hilarious, tender, and heart wrending all at the same time. I laughed so hard tears came to my eyes. It was simply wonderful the way Douglas attempted to keep his past from Rowena. The group of pirates added countless laughs to the story. There were scenes like: Gemma, Douglas's sister decorating a rose arbor with petticoates. Or the time Gemma aquired a falcon for Douglas, only the bird was stuffed, she proceeded to ""fly"" the bird around the bailey. There were many more wonderfully funny scenes. For all its laughter, this book is not devoid of intrigue and sensitivity. This truly a delightful novel that all should appreciate."
5,Delight!,"I have no idea how anyone could give this book 1 star. I laughed...many times...until I had tears streaming down my face. I'll never forget the ""rose garden"" created from rosettes on a petticoat! If you are down, read this book. If you are happy, read this book. In other words...just read the book!"
1,Would have been better if labeled a fantasy,"This book is absurd. I found a few historical flaws in the little history it had in it. This book is one of the reasons romance will never be respected. It tries to be humorous where it is inappropriate. It is obvious she couldn't be bothered to do any historical research, and the hero was one dimensional and in no way seemed realistic. I am supposed to believe that gentle man was once a ruthless pirate? I don't think so. Now that I think of it, this book wouldn't work as a fantasy either because fantasy books have more depth than this shallow romance."
2,Not up to par,"I've read 3-4 previous editions of ""New Stories From the South"", and this was probably my least favorite. There were some good moments, and some good writing, but nevertheless, I got to the end of some stories and thought ""Huh?"". Then again, as another reviewer says, some of that could possibly be attributed to what's 'hip' in short stories these days. A former co-worker said he thought that some stories being published these days were 'the literary equivalent of modern art'."
5,A Must Read,"I had a lump in my throat by the acknowledgements page. By the time I was through the introduction, I was vowing to be the first in line to snatch every book DeMuth would ever pen. By the middle of the book, I found myself amazed that a non-fiction book could have such a magnetic drawing power to it. By the end I was ready to start back at the beginning.Most non-fiction books, regardless of the genre, seem to merely consist of a handful of great pointers that could easily have been offered in article format rather than the 50,000 words of muck the reader must dig through for the good stuff. On the contrary, DeMuth carries her reader to the very end with solid, biblical truths for every parent, regardless how they were raised. I'm sure I'll have to read the book five more times at least with highlighter in-hand just to gleen what the book has to offer.I highly recommend this book."
2,not practical enough,"This book wasn't quite what I was looking for. I didn't grow up in a Christian home. So (since I didn't have a model during my own childhood) I wanted to know how to introduce my own kids to faith at home. I was really looking for more of a ""how to"" guide than this book provided. Plus, unlike the author's, my childhood was great! I grew up in a stable and supportive environment. The only thing lacking was exposure to Christianity. So, since I didn't come from a bad or dysfunctional home, I had a hard time relating to the author's own struggles. Plus, I am reluctant to discount many of the values I learned as a kid. Rather I was hoping for ways to add to them as a Christian. I didn't find enough ""practical"" advice in this Practical Guide. Maybe I was looking for more of a snapshot, or ""day in the life of a christian family"" kind of book."
1,What a Horrible Rip-Off,"Indeed. How in the world could a small glass carafe be so expensive?The most egregious insult to the buyer: There is a tiny rubber nub used to remove the rubber cover to the wire mesh filter. No matter how careful you are, the bulb will tear off after a certain number of uses. AND Eva Solo does NOT offer sale of a replacement! So here I sit with a carafe that has no other use.I hope I can spare someone else the frustration of investing in this expensive but useless coffee maker."
5,Great Coffee,"I have used a french press for years. This is better. The coffee has all the body, but is less bitter. The flavor of the beans stands out more. I love it."
2,"pretty, but smelly","The Eva Solo is pretty, elegant, and problematic. I found the rubber stopper used at the top to be *quite* smelly, as well as imparting an odd taste to the coffee poured through it. I used the Eva Solo just once. I was quite disappointed.I got a new french press to replace it. Additionally I got a small metal mesh filter to provide some additional straining. The combination, while a bit more cumbersome, has been producing fine results for quite some time now.I would not recommend the Eva Solo due to the rubber stopper being smelly, and the resultant taste."
4,gritty,"I use mine all the time. I make coffee at 5 AM and drink my big mug full, leaving the rest for someone who gets up around 6:30 or 7. We're both happy with it, but I always have gritty coffee grounds in the dregs of my mug, and that is a little disappointing.."
3,Fantastic,"I have always been fascinated with military history and most of the books I have read concern the German Wehrmacht in World War 2. I make it a point of collecting personal diaries of ordinary soldiers experiences. Burgogne's book is one of the best war diaries I have ever read. He recounts his experiences during the capture of, and more importantly, the retreat from Moscow in vivid detail. This is an important work because he is able to articulate these experiences in his book so the reader feels as if he were there. The similarities of this work and Guy Sajer's Forgotten Soldier (World War 2)are amazing and well worth the purchase for any military enthusiast. Other good accounts of the Russina campaign are by Philippe-Paul De Segur and Armand De Caulaincourt."
1,Disappointed,"How could Barbara Hambly put her name to this Book? I am a true fan of B.H., but this was a real disappointment. I plowed through it until the end thinking it had to pick up or have a twist - but nothing!"
2,I feel cheated...,"Barbara Hambly and Marc Scott Zicree are experts at created sci-fi and fantasy fit to a mold. They write with skill but not inspiration. Generally all they do is write books based on what other people made up, not adding anything really new. This book is no exception. It's an easy, mostly fun read, but pure commercialism and it strings you along to a completly unneccesary and profit motivated ""To be continued..."" ending."
1,Waste of time,"Warning - read only if you have a few days you want to waste reading disjointed snatches of a re-telling of The Stand. Understand my anger when I tell you I WAS NOT AWARE THIS WAS THE FIRST BOOK OF A TRIOLOGY when I purchased it. By the end - I cared about none of the people and had absolutely no idea what the source/project was and what exactly was done by whom. Furthermore, I don't care enough to read the other books. I love science fiction - love supernatural - this was just plain boring."
2,Magic Time,"This book is initially exciting, perhaps buoyed by Hambly's writing skill. But it quickly becomes a sort of cut-rate, bad comic book cross between Stephen King's The Stand and Sean Stewart's Galveston. Something happens -- we don't get the intellectual satisfaction of learning exactly what -- in a top secret government research facility. Technology stops working, and some people metamorphose. Two foci of presumably destructive power appear -- a rather confusing plot point -- and our questing band of heroes must tackle the first one.There are too many characters for the modest length of the book, and most are not well drawn. The cliched imagery verges on the ridiculous. It really is a comic book -- one person appears to be changing into Catwoman. The plot is fast-moving but shallow and unbelievable. While the basic idea is an interesting one, the book never gets off the ground. It comes across as imitative, lacking themes of its own."
3,"Good, but hard to get full trilogy","The book has been pretty good so far. Not great, but entertaining. It reads a bit like a miniseries, which isn't surprising considering the marquee author, Zicree.BUT, while the first and third books in the trilogy are readily available, the second is out of print and can currently only be acquired used at exorbitant prices. Dozens of dollars for a used paperback???It makes no business sense either. I'm not about to pay an arm and a leg for book two, which means the publisher loses the sale on book three. I could buy the audio book or e-book, but I dislike those formats intensely.Trilogus interruptus, I guess."
1,"This book wasn't very useful, color drawings no explanations","This book only contained (not very good) color sketches of patios and landscaping. It had no explanations of what you were looking at, and the schetches did not really give you a good idea of what the ""artist"" was trying to convey. Looked like a school project."
3,"Great book if combined with a ""how-to"" guide","The book consists of numerous sketches of decks, patios, entries, etc. It was perfect for my situation because I was simply looking for design ideas to make my patio unique and not just the traditional rectangle shape. The ""how-to"" books I found on patios and decks had lots of instruction but very few pictures. I was able to combine ideas from a couple of the sketches in this book and come up with a great design. Be advised that the book contains no building instructions or dimensions. It is simply a lot of ideas presented as sketches."
2,Poor Perth,"I felt sorry for Perth. Her owners didn't seem to care about her in the way you would think from the description. Perth had a poor life at the fault of the owners...moving her around and around. The writing style trys too hard, as if he looked up a word in the thesaurus every other word. A bad book, a bad dog owner...a sad dog."
1,A book about irresponsible dog ownership.,"As a beagle owner and lover, I was drawn to this book for obvious reasons. I was appalled, however, at the decision of Perth's owners to allow their dog to run free, in both rural and urban settings. This poses a risk to the dog and is a nuisance to neighbors and drivers alike. Beagles are at particular risk given their wanderlust tendancies. Hopefully this book will not encourage other current or potential beagle owners to be so foolhardy."
1,Perth is one lucky beagle,"to make it to 21, despite it's owners stupidity. Also the poor neighbors that had to put up with Perth's comings and goings on their property, and the howling that they must of endured ---- unbelievable!!!!!"
1,Never let Perth's owners dog-sit your dog!,"Perth's owners have no sense of responsibility. Please do not read this book. I made it through 56 pages and can read no more. Poor doggy. When she escaped the parked car, leapt the water gap onto the ferryboat (the ships screws would have torn her to bits if she hadn't made it), Perth should have headed South to Portland and become MY dog."
1,Outrageously Irresponsibe Dog Owner,"I have lived with Beagles for 33 years.I know them well.Mr. Martin's juvenile understanding of both human & canine relationships is evident throughtout the book.His and his wife's total irresponsibility is abundantly evident.This couple was characteristically inconsiderate both to neighbors and to the Beagle.They both graphically embody the culture of self-gratification to the detriment of their friends, acquaintances & their Beagle. No canine human companion should ever be subject to such totally irresponsible ""owneship."" This book,adolescently contrived & written,stands as a testimony to their vacuous understanding of Beagles & to their consistently abusive relationship with this unfortunate Beagle who deserved so much better. T'was a pity that this disastrous story of abuse was ever commited to paper.Save your money & donate it to Pet Rescue somewhere."
4,heart over mecha,"All characters in this anime are two-dimensional paper dolls, and Stormwaltz' tart description of the young lovers is not undeserved.Even so they are, in my own humble opinion, a refreshing change from the usual lecherous-cretin-meets-overendowed-bimbo(es) themes.Hey, call me a mushy old fart, but I am still a sucker for purehearted young love. The fourth episode did not leave my eyes dry. Snif. Sorry."
2,"Good but it's plagiarism, save your money and get...","This book reads, word for word, like a translation done in the late 1800's by Benjamin Jowett available in two books from Barnes & Noble's classics press. It's cheaper and the notes are better not to mention the paragraphs are numbered for reference unlike this book. Those numbers are needed if your are to attend lectures."
4,The Ultimate Kitchen Primer for Homemade Baby Food,"Replete with instruction on how to steam or microwave everything but the kitchen sink (for consumption by babies and toddlers), this bible for baby food is easy to navigate and simpler to follow.It's a must-have basic resource book for anyone who steams their veggies, not just mommies and daddies.But, keep in mind, this is a ""primer,"" don't look for any inspired ingredient combos or complex dishes here. Check out ""Baby, Let's Eat"" for that! ;-D"
5,Awesome Book,"I bought 5 books on baby food. I truly believe this is by far the best book out there. It is up to date with the latest guidelines from Culinary schools and Pediatricians.It expalins when to introduce certain foods due to possible food allergies. Every recipe is labeled with the suggest month of introduction to the infant.Also, it warns mothers of potential mistakes one can make since we have never made baby food before. For example, buying organic carrots, beets, turnips, etc when making babyfood because of the nitrates. I highly recommend this book. It is excellent!"
3,"Easy recipes, but some outdated information","This book has a variety of recipes that are straighforward and easy to prepare. They offer microwave cooking options in many of their recipes, which is great for pressed-for-time families. Their suggestions for selecting the best produce at the supermarket are very useful. However, some of the information regarding breastfeeding and weaning is outdated. In many instances the authors suggest that breastmilk is not necessary after the first year and that children should be weaned by that age. In reality, breastmilk provides immunities and essential nutrients that are extremely beneficial to children well past their first year of life."
2,The author's lack of education in nutrition is evident,"Overall a nice read however, bad advice and misinformation are evident in the areas of food composition and allergies. Not a good choice for the parent of a child with a clinical diagnosis that impacts eating behavior or nutrition."
2,General info you could figure out for yourself,"I bought this book encouraged by the reviews and am very disappointed. The information is pretty broad stuff like you find in all the free baby magazines. As a vegetarian, I found the author's warning to ""seriously consider"" raising a vegetarian child insulting. Is he not aware that vegetarianism is seriously thought-out? And that vegetarians are often more conscious of putting together a balanced diet than non-vegetarians? I was looking for some suggestions on what protein-rich foods to feed my baby, when, and how. But aside from some obviously generic tofu suggestions, there wasn't much there.I will say there was one good chart that listed which foods are appropriate when. However, even these foods are the most common ones, without alternatives listed."
5,Great book....wonderful for all parents,"I was unable to breastfeed my daughter for more than 6 weeks due to some personal complications. I wanted to feel like I was doing something good for my daughter even though I was unable to breastfeed. This book helped me to learn how to make my own baby food, as well as adding a chart from the AAP on when to introduce foods to your child. It is my favorite book, and I may just order a copy for shower gifts."
3,A good cookbook if you want to prepare a homemade baby food,I purchased this book because i need some ideas on what to feed my 1-year old daughter. In general the book is pretty good and informative. The book provides a lot of recipes for baby purees and finger food ideas which some of them you can simply buy from the store. I wish the book had more recipes on toddler's food.
5,favorite shower gift,"This book has made my ""oh no another shower gift"" a thing of the past. It's definitely at the top of my gift giving list. It's super!"
4,very helpful book,"This book is great to help you learn to make baby food. Very easy to understand and even helps with the basics of cooking things like green beans. Then tells how to prepare them for the baby to eat. It also gives information on when to introduce certain foods, (8 months or a year, etc). A must have if you want to make your own baby food."
5,More than a nice collection of recipes,"While it offers a wide variety of delicious, wholesome recipes, the real strength of this nutrition book is its guidelines for weaning babies and introducing ""real foods"" into their diets. There is a description of a method of introduction which tests for food allergies and may reduce their incidence. It also encourages babies and older children to try and accept new foods. My daughter is proof this method works; she had no allergic reactions as food were introducted, and counts beans and legumes, pasta, shellfish, hummos, sushi, and asparagus among her favorite foods. I give copies to all my friends having babies."
4,Baby Food Made Easy,"I bought this book and Ruth Yaron's Super Baby Food. I would highly recommend this book. It is very easy to use and it lays out exactly what to feed your child when. (I found that the Super Baby Food book was a bit too complicated to navigate.) The only thing that it could do better is discuss more about food storage. Otherwise, I think it is the best baby food book I've found."
1,Terrible breastfeeding advice,"The recipes are okay but nothing exciting. The authors stick with the old school advice of starting a baby with white rice cereal while many professionals advise a whole grain or actual food like avocado as a first food. But the worst part of this book is the weaning/breastfeeding advice. It goes against everything I have read about extended breastfeeding (up until a year or longer) and the authors actually say it can cause nutritional deficiencies which is just plain wrong. If you want to wean that is fine, but people shouldn't do it based on the bad advice in this book. Check out a book like Feeding Baby Green for better nutritional advice and a breastfeeding specific book for breastfeeding advice."
5,Great book and really helpful author,"The Well-Fed Writer is honestly the best book I've ever come across in terms of a how-to on freelance commercial writing. He is funny and his humor draws you in and keeps you reading. The information is priceless. I can't think of any other author who had the wisdom to include sample marketing brochures and letters and such. Peter makes it clear he is here to help; not just to make money from this book. Plus, I e-mailed him with questions and he responded right away in detail. That solidified my allegiance to this author and his book. I am in the midst of printing my direct-mail pieces to send out; thanks to the samples in the book. I have a good feeling about my future..."
2,Remember How Bowerman REALLY Makes His Money,"I have read the book. I agree with the reviews posted here regarding Bowerman's advice on organizing your work, etc. However, few authors who write books such as this one care to substantiate the amount of money they made as freelancers *prior* to publishing a ""how to"" book. I know writers who have tried to cold-calling and other self promotional advice in this book, and they have categorically met with minimal success. I agree with the other reviewers here that mentoring and networking with existing professional connections will get a writer further than the cold-calling and marketing Bowerman suggests."
4,How To Get Started As A Commercial Writer,"The business of writing is just that, a business. I picked up a copy as I began to start my freelance writing career. Although this book won't teach you how to become a great writer, it will teach you how to market yourself as a writer. That at the end of the day can be argued is more important. You want to get paid for what you do.My key takeaway was to always be marketing yourself to keep your pipeline filled up with clients and prospects. Bowerman admits to making 700+ calls in a short period to get the ball rolling.He does emphasize pricing yourself hourly, rather than by the job which is my preferred method.Highly recommended!"
3,Great Book If...,"While this is a decent book full of wonderful advice, let's be realistic for a moment. I found the book impractical for a person in my situation where my family *depends* on my income. This book, and the career it describes, is for someone who has no one to support, who doesn't care if the mortgage/rent isn't paid on time, and who can take the risk. Alternatively, if you have someone to support you, it might work for you. Also, most of the freelancing he talks about is working for large corporations as a contracted employee. If you're looking for info on freelancing for magazines and newspapers only, this probably isn't the book you want."
3,Out Of Date,"It is easy to see this was a good book when released.However, it feels out of date. The book essentially revolves around the idea of becoming dominate in your ""local market"" i.e. the city in which you live. Phone calls and personal meetings are hugely important in world this book was written. Emails, not so much. The point at which Bowerman strongly suggests getting connected to the Internet is the case in point. Today, no writer would seriously consider not being connected the Internet.As a result, the book becomes one to skim, not read in detail. The basics are sound but the means of execution are out of date. I have no had the chance to read the ""Second Helping"" book that Bowerman wrote in 2004 - perhaps that has more up to date information.I wouldn't recommend buying this book. Get it from the library. It is no longer the kind of book you'll be lining with notes and post-its, so a library copy would suffice."
4,Expands on Bly's work,"This book is chock full of useful content - especially on the business aspects of freelance writing (the part of the game most writers enjoy the least).Bowerman gets high marks for his explanation of a simple, repeatable system and for his very specific advice on where and how to find work.I also benefitted from Bowerman's tips on billing and the use of technology, which is a weakness of Robert Bly's classic ""Secrets of a Freelance Writer.""One big strike against the book is it's design and layout. Don't get me wrong, the pages full of text left the impression that I had gotten my money's worth. But more white space would have made ""The Well-Fed Writer"" much easier to read.This book is a valuable addition to any freelance writer's library."
2,Just OK,"Bowerman uses a light, easy-to-read style to outline the common sense actions all aspiring freelancers must undertake to ""break in"". He describes a business system, which is good. He tells how to take an organized approach, which is good. And he covers a lot, from netting clients to handling contracts to scheduling to sharpening your pencil. What I take great exception to, however, is a myth that Bowerman carelessly and willingly perpetuates: that the writer's life is easy.I understand why he does -- by making earning a living as a freelancer seem easy while providing a comprehensive guide to joining this carefree life, he sells books. But freelancing is not easy. It's hard, and demands determination, talent, and luck.Read Bowerman's book because it's a decent guide on how to become a freelancer. But don't get suckered by his proclaimed life of leisure. There is more to it than Bowerman either understands or acknowledges."
5,Great Stuff!,"Bowerman's book jumped off the shelf at just the right time in my life: I was looking for a way to make a decent living at writing - writing anything! - and stay at home with my girls. Maybe I was receptive to his advice but since I've read the book and put his techniques into practice, I've found his wisdom is sound. I've e-mailed him, too, and have found him responsive, encouraging and helpful. Anyone who's willing to work hard, take a chance and make success happen can become a successful copywriter. I just wish I'd come across his book a few years ago."
2,Just a Marketing Book,"This book pumps you full of dreams. However, then you realize that Bowerman's strategy really amounts to telemarketing. He talks about making 50 cold calls a day. Although I respect the honesty be prepared to be deflated. One might as well just read a marketing book?"
5,on-target & timely information,"Peter Bowerman has a writing voice that conveys solid advice, tongue-in-cheek observations and enough confidence-in-the-reader that practically no one is immune from crossing that last writing barrier...and that is, taking that first step into the commercial writing arena. My first action was to go out and get business cards printed. My own library of how-to-write books now numbers over 250 texts, but this one is invaluable for those who want to create copy for the marketplace. His kind and encouraging words of response to my two e-mails confirmed that he's the kind of person who knows his stuff and is not worried about sharing it. His only fault will be if he doesn't follow up with another writing book in the near future!"
3,Take it with a grain of salt,"This book is a fun and informative read, and I've recently started making money by following Bowerman's advice.However, remember that Bowerman started his freelancing career during the economic boom of the 90s, and he had 15 years of marketing/sales experience already. There were greener pastures back then.That said, his tips on self-promotion alone are worth the price of the book. By following his advice I immediately benefitted in my old job (which I still do part-time, for now), and thanks to his suggestions the freelance writing money is slowly trickling in. (It's been 9 months, instead of six months stated on the cover, and I'm not quite financially self-sufficient yet.)If you're going to try this, make sure you do the groundwork, get your promotional packet and samples together, and get your ""systems"" in place (see chapter 8)before you quit your day job."
1,Very misleading,"This book was very disappointing. Supposedly it's about making a living as a commercial writer, but after a couple chapters going on about how great the job is and how lucrative it will be (which began to sound like an infomercial), we get to the meat of it. What the book covers is freelance copywriting for ad and marketing agencies. That's fine if you're an advertising and marketing copywriter, but I'm not. I'm a technical writer, and I thought this would teach me how to work it into an independent gig. There is exactly ONE PAGE about technical writing, and it didn't give me any new information. I wound up resenting having to spend that much money for one page of retread info. The book should have been titled ""How to be a Successful Marketing Copywriter."" That might have been fair. But as far as I'm concerned, it was a waste of money. I'm exactly where I was before I bought the book."
5,Make easy the structural dynamics,"I bought this book in a little bookstore in Monterrey Mexico Downtown for a ridiculous price (400 pesos= 40 dollars), the information in it is invaluable for the understanding of the structural behavior under dynamics loads (Equipment, wind, earthquake, impact etc.) and more important is that you can traduce this behavior to the physical world in a comprehensive and easy way, with the help of this book I was able to design from a panoramic advertising structures to steel and concrete Vessels in a high seismic area, from a bulk materials conveyors structures to equipments foundations. If you have the money to buy it, buy it, and the book pays for itself."
2,Home Place,"I like the premise of this story. Looking at the remains of a house and thinking about the family that used to live and work there. Two things about this book bothered me - the little boy was named Timmy on one page and Tommy on another page. At the end, the story tells of the honeysuckle vine comvered chimney, but the illustration shows a morning glory vine covered chimney. Little things like this bug me and someone should have caught it before the book was published."
2,class assingment,"On a wlk one day, a girl and her parents find a field of daffodils. Wondering how they got there, they find a chimney and foundation. They imagine how life would have been in the house. Going back through time, a normal family was living there. Now this place is home to just animals.This was not one of my favorite books. It took a while to understand what was going on. If your child has a vivid imagination, this is a good book for them. The illustrations are beautiful."
5,feel like your skin,These are fabulous gloves. They are as nice as they are beautiful. I forget I have them on. I just love them. Makes me wish I had more than one pair of hands so that I could enjoy them more.
1,Italian Lambskin Driving Gloves,Poor quality and poor fit. I returned the pair I bought. Do not waste your time or money on this product.
2,Worth it??? I think NOT!!,"Fits like a glove? Well, yes... they're gloves! Are they worth Seventy-Six Dollars? I don't think so?!! I was not impressed when I received them in the mail. First impression was, ""So these expensive gloves come in a clear plasic bag marked Made In Italy, and that's it?!!"" Next was the so called ""Sewn with Italian styling and care""... in which I had to cut threads that stuck out. Looked more like it was sewn with not that much care. I don't know, but to me these look more like they could be knock-offs, or maybe that's how Fratelli Orsini gloves are?"
3,Dogma - 'Feeding The Future' (Polygram) 3 1/2 stars,"Dogma features vocalist/guitarist Phil Allocca and bassist Sean Carmoda,both previously of the band Law&Order.Just like Law&Order,Dogma won't get an even break.That's a shame because 'Feeding The Future' is a decent CD.Good alternative metal.This appears to be Dogma's sole release,so far anyway.Some of the cuts that I thought stood out were ""Unexpected Ways"",""He Knows"",""Reasons"" and ""Seven Miles Per Second"".Give it a listen if you have the chance."
4,Good mix,"My 3 yr old has a dairy and gluten intolerance and this mix is a great alternative for him. Easy to make and the taste is great for a wheat free mix. We can use the bread for just about anything; french toast, sandwich's, etc. It's great to have a good tasting alternative."
4,"Good but not exceptional, A super + for making it for bread machine","Pamela's Products Wheat-Free Amazing Bread Mix, 19-Ounce Packages (Pack of 6)Greatr for gluton free diets- especially as it can be made in a bread machine- It rises well following directions."
5,An excellent GF bread mix,"Gluten free bread mixes are often disappointing. They come out too dry, don't have a good flavor, fall apart when used for sandwiches. But Pamela's Bread Mix tastes good, has a good texture, and doesn't have to be toasted to be enjoyed. It makes great sandwiches, and the several variations offered on the bag make for a nice variety of breads. My husband especially favors the cinnamon bread for breakfast. As a sandwich bread he really enjoys the plain bread recipe with about 1/3 cup of added sesame seeds in the batter and extra sprinkled on top. Since we found this mix we have stopped experimenting with the various GF recipes we have collected. It does it all and is easy to make."
5,Pamela's Wheat -Free Amazing Bread mix,"This makes unusually good bread that is bendable and chewy and a hint of sweetness probaby from the sorghum grain they use. It makes really good, ""normal"" pizza crust and flatbread too. My favorite GF mix. Also dairy free."
1,May cause discomfort,"I tried many gluten free breads. Flavor-wise, this bread is good. But the real issue I had with this bread is that it caused me quite a lot of discomfort because of bloating and gas. Yes, it's awkward to admit that, but I wanted to warn others from potential painful symptoms.I have celiac as well as ulcerative colitis, so my digestive system is sensitive. I bought the 6-pack from amazon, and with the first loaf I baked I thought the symptoms might be related to something else I ate. By the second loaf my suspicion grew stronger. With the third, I decided to do a little experiment and just eat the bread by itself and see if it's really the source of the discomfort/gas. The answer is yes.I should note that I did not have these symptoms with Bob's red millgluten free bread (which is also tasty). There is definitely something in Pam's bread mix that the digestive system of some people might disagree with.Hope it help,"
5,Excellent bread,This bread is excellent. We used it to make mini muffins and topped with carmelized onions and brie. It turned out delicious. I highly recommend.
2,not what I hoped for,The mix is easy to use but I dont care for the texture of the bread. Wont be buying any more.
1,"Tastes good at first, but really too doughy, sweet and caused awful bloating/diarrhea","I really enjoyed the first few slices of this bread since it was quite moist, but it is really a bit dough-ey and too sweet. Also, it says 170 calories for 1/16 of a loaf, but I only got 10 slices (breadmaker pan), so each slice is pretty high calories. After two days of eating it, I am in a world of hurt. I've had similar problems with other bread mixes, including those with a lot of bean flour. If I just have one slice every other day or so, I might be ok. Disappointing. Thank goodness for pepto bismol."
2,Blah,"I have used the Gluten Free Pantry brand in the past and this doesn't hold a candle, but it is cheaper, you get what you pay for"
5,It's actually delicious!,"I was despondent after being tested for gluten-sensitivity, but this mix is actually very delicious. I would choose it over 'normal' bread any day. I like that it is easy to make (with a bread maker) and it makes a rockin' french toast."
5,My family LOVES this bread!,"This bread is very tasty. I like it because it's so moist and maintains its texture instead of becoming crumbly the second day after being baked. It is so easy to make sandwiches, spread margarine or peanut butter and in general, do whatever we would normally do with bread. We are able to fully enjoy bread now instead of eating the cardboard-textured bread we were buying. I love this bread and highly recommend all Pamela's Products.Also, the subscribe and save plan has been a great deal for my family. We save money and I don't have to remember to go online to order. I simply get an email telling me my order is about to be shipped and I get at least a day or two in which to go online to make any changes to the order - with a click of a button I can skip any order. I just love it!"
5,Great bread-great price,"I had been making the Red Mill bread, but I have to say this blows away the competion in both taste and ease. I don't have to add a bunch of extra different ingredients (like egg whites, butter, etc). Good flavor & nice looking loaf. The bread is soft as one reviewer mentioned. We don't mind, but some might."
2,Disappointed,"Since learning my husband has celiac disease, he hasn't been able to eat pizza with us on homemade pizza nights. It used to be a treat. So I was excited when I first tried the bread mix thinking he could enjoy pizza again. However, the dough never seems to bake throughout; it always turns out gummy. We've tried letting it rise even longer than the hour recommended, even that didn't help. I still have a few bags left so I'm going to try something other than pizza."
4,Must have for GFers,"This is, by far, the best bread mix I've had, and I've tried quite a few. I have found pre-baked breads that are better than this, but they are few and far between, and I find that this mix is actually better than many of the frozen breads out there. Try adding herbs and spices to the mix (rosemary and a little extra olive oil is really good, or Italian herbs) or any flavor you like, it's a great base. It also makes great pizza dough, though it's a bit hard to work with in terms of texture. I definitely recommend this mix, it's tasty, has a great texture, and pretty easy to make, all in all."
3,"Good, but not great...","If you have been deprived of sandwiches for a long time because of a gluten sensitivity , this bread mix may seem like a treat. On the other hand, if you have found Whole Foods gluten-free loaves, such as the Prairie bread with pumpkin and sunflower seeds, then I think you'll be disappointed as I was. I tried the manual mixing method, and took special care to allow the bread to rise as I would a non-GF bread. The instructions say only to let it rise 1 hr. which I believe is inadequate. Perhaps the yeast in the supplied packet was not as active as it should have been -- in any event the resulting bread did not rise properly in several attempts. Flavor is not that great, but I did make some ""everything"" bagels which were fairly tasty if not very light."
4,This is SOOOOOOO GOOD!!,I have tried a few of the gluten free breads and they crumble when you try to make a sandwich. I tried this brand and it was so moist and easy to cut. I kept it in the fridge for over a week and it stayed good to the last piece. It worked great in my bread machine. I look forward to trying other variations and pizza crust!
3,Decent if baked in regular oven,"I take exception to the holes being poked in the bag prior to shipping. Now I have 6 bags with holes in them. A good entry for bugs. Why can't they just fill the bags without air in them like other flour companies do?The first attempt at making this bread in my bread machine was a failure. I use a Zojirushi bread machine, maybe that's the problem. I'll have to research other machines that might be better for the gluten-free products.My second bread attempt had better results. Followed the directions for oven baking and it came out OK. It looked fantastic when it came out, nice & high but it didn't take long to deflate. The taste and texture is just OK so I still haven't found a delicious gluten free bread mix that I can say I love."
5,gluten free and great!,I have tried a lot of bread mixes and most are hard and only good for 1-2 days. Pamela's bread mix is soft and lasts a week. It tastes great too! I have celiac and let my doctor know how great this product is so he can tell other patients.
2,Tastes Great BUT check out the SUGAR content,"Yes, people will like Pamela's gluten free bread mix. I did too BUT do the math on the very high amount to sweetener in this mix. 9 grams per slice (based on their stated 16 slices per loaf)! This is 144 grams for the loaf which comes to 1 1/4 cups of sweetener. As you know that's 15 tablespoons in the mix (approximately) so compare that to your favorite recipes. I see no one else coming even close to this in mixes or recipes. I can't think of any reason they are doing this except for taste - to make it more sellable. Just a heads up since we need to be cutting back on sugars not ramping up.:-)"
5,So convenient!,"I love receiving this item delivered right to my home. My husband is gluten and dairy intolerant and we have to make bread at home for him to be able to bring his own food to work for the day. This is the best tasting and holds up the best of all of the gluten and dairy free breads that we've tried. We typically bake a loaf a week in our bread maker, so it's super convenient to be able to just subscribe and not have to think about running out!"
3,Not crazy about this bread.,"I'm not knocked out about this bread. The taste is OK but it's like a brick and in my opinion, doesn't work well for sandwich bread. I think it is a quality product , I just wish it wasn't so heavy."
4,Makes great bagels!,"This mix works very well for making bagels. The recipe is on the side of the package. I haven't had great success with making bread with it. It's too heavy and it falls after baking. Maybe that's an altitude problem or something? Anyway, I use it frequently for making bagels and toast the bagels and use them to make open faced sandwiches or anything that I need bread for. The flavor is very good - a little sweet with a whole grain flavor. I've used it to make pizza crust too and that's pretty good too. The bagels are my favorite though!"
5,"Tastes like real bread, good texture, flavor.","This is a very versatile product, good tasting, texture and good for bread, pizza, and other breads.Allows the consumer to ""manipulate the dough a little bit to try out new ideas for other breads"" I really do enjoy using this bread mix. Thank you to Pamela's."
4,Great Bread and Gluten Free!,I use this in my bread machine and nothing could be easier.Sometimes I add a little honey and extra salt or poppy seeds and nuts for variation. Makes a full-bodied bread that can keep well and freeze well.Thank goodness for Pamela.
3,Way too sweet,"This bread tastes great and keeps well, but it is way too sweet for anyone with a sensitive gut or recovering from CD. Cane sugar is the 3rd ingredient! (Can make you gassy too, though maybe that is the xanthum gum.) Anyway, our gfcf household is looking for another brand."
4,Great Product - Pricing is the same as Fred Meyer!,"Firstly, let me say that this is a great product if you are looking for a wheat free bread as I was.It's moist, tasty and great for bread machines.The only reason I ordered this was because of the big 23% OFF sign, however what they reduced in product price, they made back in shipping. Also, there was NO DISCOUNT for buying 6 packets.Price including shipping was $36 and change.Bottom line is that instead of waiting several days to buy this product, just go to your local Fred Meyer where it's sold for $6 per packet! If they had not ""reduced"" the price by 23%, then you would be getting ripped off severely as you would be paying close to $10 more - you can get an entire grocery list delivered to your home from Fred Meyer for about the same!!When you factor in that you also get club card rewards, you are better off buying it from Fred Meyer than direct from the manufacturer....I won't be ordering online again.But good product!"
2,Pamelas Wheat Free Amazing Bread Mix,"I was a little disapointed with this product. I am allergic to dairy and wheat. When I looked at the ingreadents it did say say wheat free, but now where did it say that there may be some dairy. When I got the package it said it may contain dairy."
2,Dated,"I purchased a case of this bread mix because my daughter has celiac and I find it so hard to find products at a reasonable price. I have made 3 out of the 6 packages and only 1 turned out. There is no date on the yeast packet so on the last one I finally decided to use my own yeast and that did rise properly. My packs are dated May 22, 2010 but like I said the yeast has no date on it like other products I have bought. My bar code is 93709 30060. So needless to say when I thought I was saving money it actually cost me just the same price as when I show at the store. I will continue to look for products on the website. Thank you for letting me vent a bit."
5,Great bread!,"I bought this mix for my daughter's boyfriend, she made it for him and he loved it. It smelled so good when it was baking that we had to try some ourselves. The texture is a bit different than regular bread but it tasted great. Her boyfriend was happy to be able to eat bread that does not taste like cardboard."
5,A sigh of relief,"My child was re-diagnosed with a gluten allergy a few months ago. I had went through changing his diet when he was an infant/toddler, but I knew that doing it again as a six year old was going to be more difficult. It is important to note that my child also has Aspergers; so change for him has been difficult.I, like any other mother, frantically searched to find foods that my child could and would eat. I am embarrassed to tell you how much I spent on breads alone. I couldn't find any that he would eat. After resolving that we just wouldn't eat anything similar to bread, I stumbled on this mix in a different health food store. I have been familiar with Pamela's products and recommend their products to anyone who hasn't tried them. I was amazed by the outcome. This bread has great texture, looks like the real deal, and a taste that rallies the real deal as well. Amazon.com also has the best price if you use its free super saver shipping. HIghly recommend"
4,Easy and Delicious Wheat-Free Bread,The mix was very convenient to use and bread delicious. I added sorghum molasses to the liquid mixture and the bread was even better.
5,great time saver!,"Imagine, GF bread that is a time saver! But in the big picture, I bake my own healthy flax seed bread. Very tasty, but very time consuming. Pamela's is the best tasteing, best texture I've found that I don't have to measure 4 or 5 flours to make. Just oopen the bag and mix. I buy this stuff by the case. I love to make rolls with it. I just haven't found anything better."
2,Not so great : (,"This GF bread mix was not my favorite. I prefer GF Pantry. Pamelas was really dense and tasted like bisquits not white bread. GF Pantry had all the attributes of white bread, unlike Pamelas, first it was actually white, it's fluffy and it tastes like white bread. So anyway I will be buying GF Pantry from here on."
4,Eating Bread Again!,"My wife can no longer eat products containing wheat, so she had to give up sandwiches, her morning toast and other bread-based products. This excellent mix solved the problem and returned all of those treats to her menu. The mix worked perfectly in our bread machine. Just follow the simple instructions. We use extra large eggs in our home, so I adjusted the recipe to use a bit less water to compensate. Worked just fine. We will try more of this company's products in the future."
5,Best gluten free bread,"Pamela's amazing bread is wonderful. It stays soft, makes great sandwiches and toasts very well. I use a bread machine on basic white bread setting.I would recomend this product to everyone."
3,"Tastes great, but bad side effects","I bought the 6 pack of these mixes and was really excited that they turned out so well in my bread machine. The bread tastes amazing, but about 2 hours later the problems start. Myself and everyone who has tried it has developed severe bloating and gas that lasts about 12 hours. I think it may be from the sorghum flour, as I don't have any intolerances to eggs, milk, etc and neither do my family members. I also tried making the pizza crust, which also tastes very good, but results in the same effects."
4,Great for Buns,I use this mix for hotdog and hamburger buns. It works great and it's simple. Way cheaper than buying already made gluten free buns. I just make a batch and freeze them for when we need them.
5,Great bread!,"I've tried so many breads and I love Pamela's and use it for bagels, hot rolls, hamburger buns and bread. It is great tasting, easy to make and so near like the wheat kinds of bread. I won't use any other brand. My family even likes it."
1,Not what I expected,"I made two loves in my Zoji, and they both came out flat and wet (moist). Blah! I even cut back the water 1/2 cup and still the same. I used the basic settings on my machine. I followed Zoji directions and then Pamela's on the second loaf. If anyone out there has a Zoji and thier bread is coming out great, please respond back. I would love to know your secrets. I have 4 more times to try, and if they do no turn out, I will not be purchasing the product again."
3,Pamela's bread mix,"Pamela's Products Wheat-Free Amazing Bread Mix, 19-Ounce Packages (Pack of 6)I ordered this bread mix not realizing that I would need a big kitchen aid mixer, which I do not own. I gave it to some friends who did have a mixer and they had trouble getting it to cook all the way through without burning the outer part of it. Another friend of mine started cooking it in her bread machine and says that it works great that way. (follow the bread machine directions)"
3,Bread...Gluten Free,"Well, I haven't found a better bread, so this works for now. It's easy to make in the bread machine but it sure isn't the taste & texture of ""wheat"" bread."
5,i can have pizza,"I love this. I make deep dish pizza, breadsticks, or just a loaf of bread. for grilled cheese and tomato sandwiches never tasted so good.i use garlic olive oil for the oil"
3,Topeak WhiteLite DX Bicycle Light,"Amazon's description of this light does not mention that it uses ""N"" batteries; they are expensive and rechargables are not available. While the light performs reasonably well, it isn't worth the $30+ regular price (although the discounted price I paid led me to conclude it wasn't worth returning). I keep it mounted on my bike but use it mainly as a backup to another headlight, or in a pinch when I'm out later than planned."
2,Switch broke after a month,"I bought this light at a local bike shop. Initially, I was very happy with it. It does a good job of projecting light at night. However, a month after buying it, and with average use (2-3 times a week), the switch to turn the light on and off has broken.Now that I have used this light for a while, I think there are much better lights out there to buy and would look elsewhere for another light to fit your needs."
4,"Works Great, only 1 mod I'd make","It's bright, mounts real easy, and lasts quite a while.The only modification I would make, is to give it different levels of brightness. Other LED lights I have come with 3 levels and a flash cycle.That's it...Otherwise, it's a great inexpensive bike light"
5,WOW,"this was a BIG book, and definately a hit to son the guitarist.This was a well done book, stays open easy with the binding and had lots of songs to choose from. Since I play piano, I wish I'd gotten one for me too! Package arrived on time and in great condition. Thanks!"
4,"High Pitched, High Energy!","When I started looking for a book to order for all my musicians in a growing praise team, I picked this one b/c of it's contents and, in all honestly, availability. I needed to have bunch of copies and couldn't afford all of them at once, so I picked something I could find almost anywhere. Most of my vocalists are messo-soprano or below so it's hard to sing a lot of the songs because most of the keys are so high, but there are several great resources in the book. My favorite is the index of keys. Great song selection too. Chords, a few already transposed for use with a capo, and large print. Overall a safe and varied choice."
2,Nice resource but severely outdated,"I bought a book like this about 8 years ago and it looks like this is from the same publish year. No newer songs. That was disappointing. Otherwise, good for older songs and stuff from the 90s"
4,one of the best P & W books i've seen,"excellent praise and worship tool... easy to follow... might need to listen to examples of some songs to get the right sound, but other than that... a powerful investment..."
5,A lovely film about love when and where you least expect it.,"Daniel Lavoire and Claire Bloom gives great performances in this heart warming movie.Leaving wealth and a lousy life for a poor life in a cellar flat, with an every day chalenge just to survive, Claire Bloom does find both love from a fugitive with a drinking problem - Daniel Lavoire - and hope for survival in the garbage left on the streets.Both she and her friend lifts themselves to a higher level by finding the urge to better themselves and grab a last chance for both love and a meaningful life together, in a way that shall not be revealed here - Go for this rare movie - it is a small pearl of wisdom wrapped in the life of ordinary people in a humble part of the city."
5,great phone for the price,wow! this is a huge upgrade from a 900mhz phone. now i can walk around the back yard and have no problem with static. the answering machine is easy to set up. the only complaint i do have is that the voice can sound muffled when recording your outgoing message otherwise this was a great phone for 50.00 im getting another for xmass
1,Massive amounts of Line interference,"The quality of this phone was horrible! I don't know if it was just the one phone I picked up, but there was INCREDIBLE interference for the answering party if I strayed more than eight feet from the base set. If I went into another room in the house, the static got worse. The strange thing is, the caller can't hear the static, but the person on the other end hears tons of static. At first I thought it was the location where I had the base set, so I tried plugging the phone into three different locations in the house and still had the same problem. I even tried it in a friend's apartment and had the same problem. Good thing I saved the receipt."
3,better than the last one,"after dealing with an old at&t 900 mhz cordless(with a loose battery connection)i thought any other cordless would be a dream. i recently bought this phone based on the functions and appearance but quickly found flaws. the ringer is not loud enough. i have to carry the phone into the next room with me if i want to hear the ring and there doesn't seem to be a way to turn the ringer volume up. also, if my stereo, located right next to the phone, is a little too loud i can hear it coming through on the handset. the sound overall is a bit tinny. perhaps it's only because i was so frustrated with my last cordless that i can rate this a 3. it is easy to set up and operate. the answering machine messages are clear and i can adjust the volume to listen. it's easy to program and operate but the sound quality leaves something to be desired."
2,Answering machine sucks,"This has one of the worst answering machine voice qualities I've heard for awhile. It's weird that after all these years of digital answering machines, most companies still can't produce a decent quality one.Also, the phone silver lining scratches easily, and the directory interface is just as bad as other vtechs. NOT recommended for anything other than looks."
2,I can't hear you!,"I have been looking for a decent cordless with answering system for my home office. The instructions for volume control on the handset aren't very clear, so after messing around with a headset and so on I finally figured it out. The volume on the handset can be adjusted only when the phone is on with the arrow keys. I had the phone for over a week and was ready to return it before I had figured this out. The Answering system is easy to use, and remote access is a breeze."
2,I can't hear you!,"I have been looking for a decent cordless with answering system for my home office. The handset volume is abysmal, I have to turn everything in the house off and the fan on my notebook is louder than the person I am speaking with on the phone. The Answering system is easy to use, and remote access is a breeze. Too bad I don't have super human hearing, but then, if I could spend the money on that I probably should have bought a more expensive telephone."
1,A Piece of Crap,"I bought this phone on February 21, 2004. I thought it looked nice and sophisticated and for the price it couldn't be beat. It is now August 3, 2004 and it died. I called the company to see if they could tell me the problem but they told me it died but they will replace it if I send it back with proof of purchase and I will receive a new phone within 7-14 days of them receiving my phone and figuring out what if anything is wrong with it . So, I am now out of phone for about 3 weeks or I could never buy V-tech ever again and purchase a new one. Oh, and the reception once I went to the backyard was crappy. Don't buy it and do your self a favor spend a little more money for quality. I gave this product 1 star because that was the lowest rating I could give it deserves a -1"
5,I loved this book so much.,"As a Buddhist woman with several Catholic relatives, I was so curious how a Catholic priest was able to reconcile the non-dualism of Buddhism with the duality of Christianity. I was hoping that reading this book would provide that insight. Well, really, it didn't, except that maybe most Christians are misunderstanding the idea of non-duality. I don't know; I don't pretend to know. But after reading this book, I became almost obsessed with Merton; it takes such an unusual and open-minded person to just go with what he senses - sees, hears, feels - rather than by what he has been told. Such honesty is rare. His description of satori, as he experienced it, was incredibly vivid and open. And, of course, the end left me feeling that it shouldn't have been over; there should have been more. But I know that's just my attachment talking; it was as it should have been. Namaste."
4,"Fascinating, timeless, perfect for younger readers.","It is interesting to note that, as Clive Staples Lewis' non-fictional apologetic works seem to be going ""out of fashion"" in favor of works from more sophisticated theologians with 1990's sensibilites, the Chronicles of Narnia, introduced by the above title, have neither lost their audience or power. This is to be expected. I'm thankful for such a quality series, which can be read simply as exciting out-of-this-world fantasy, or for those up to the challenge, as a complicated allegorical system. This story has a remarkable reputation with youngsters, but any adult who has yet to read it will find it suprisingly rewarding."
4,Pokemon Yellow: Prima's Official Strategy Guide EB Electronic Botique Exclusive Collectors Cover,"I Bought this item to replace my old one, which was loved to death. I wanted an exact copy with the EB collectors cover. The pages were pristine with no markings or highlights but i wish I new that the front cover had minor indents on it. Other than that, I am very pleased with the book."
4,Innovative & fun,"I bought this CD and a couple of others like it last December, as a DJ booked for Christmas parties. A few of the songs don't really work with the added beats, but most of them are really fun and different. If you're sick of the same songs played over and over again every Christmas, you will definitely appreciate this CD in your player."
3,A Bit Disapointed,"When I bought Staying a Life, I was expecting a 2 CD set, since this CD was released in Europe and Japan as a 2 CD set.All and all I'am very impressed with the U.S. version but I think it should be rereleased as a double live CD.(not refering to The Final Chapter 2-CD)I saw Accept live in Chicago at the Oak Theater in October of1993 and they put on one heck of a live show."
4,keep this series coming,"I agree with the other reviewers in that these films rip some things from past blockbuster movies. I don't personally have an issue with that. The special effects at times are quite cheesy. However, these films have a little charm to them. I hope the series continues and evolves the story...and hopefully, the budget will increase a little bit over time also, so the special effects get better. I thought this film was better than the first and the goal of the producers should be to keep incrementally getting better with each release, reusing a core of individuals from film to film while not being afraid to kill off important characters."
2,Can you stomach it?,"Well, I must admit that this review is biased seeing as how I did not see the whole movie but only about half. But that was all I could handle of the stilted dialogue, ripped off-story lines, and most of all, gratuitous sexual crap thrown in for no good reason at all.Most sci-fi movies require some suspension of belief and a little, if not a great deal, of viewer sympathy with the actors and the director's budgets but sometimes its a little too much.My thought to you sci-fi fans is to pass this one up and to move on to more sophisticated, better made pictures."
4,another great album,"This album is by no means epic, but it is very good; the audio clips, along with the singers personal struggles really tough the listeners heart.Good Lyrics, Tough Guitar, overall Very good. 4 stars!"
1,sound doesn't work,"The plot looks great, but the sound was so poor we stopped after 10 minutes because we couldn't understand it.The pictures quality wasn't great either---too bad! we wanted to watch it!"
4,not bad,"The book is well written, and contains some interesting historical information regarding the relationship between this unusual system and some of the karates. It is no substitution for an instructor, but it is informative and a good intro to this particular variant of wuzuchuan."
3,Only if I was a Viking.,"A good effort, but cold to me. A supporter and fan, only reason I got a copy. Too political and lost the lust she once displayed on her earlyer years. The love and romance of Bjork is gone, maybe someday she'll find love again."
2,First Bjork disappointment,"Unlike a lot of the reviewers on here, I actually loved Medulla along with all of Bjork's other albums. This was truly my fist Bjork disappointment-- it has some bright spots, but they only manage a slight sparkle at that. It is most reminiscent of Homogenic, but it doesn't manage to maintain a collective mood the way that album did, nor do its songs resonate as strongly. This is unfortunately a weak showing for Bjork who was-- for me-- up until now, all wins and no losses. Wait, I actually didn't care for Drawing Restraint that much either...but that was a soundtrack and didn't count. But I did love Selmasongs."
2,Bjork makes another EP (4 great songs),"I was hoping for better after Medulla & listening to the first 3 AMAZING songs from Volta made me think I was about to witness one of the best albums Bjork has ever crafted & then song #4 drops & its all downhill from there. Timbalands heavy-handed beats on ""Innocence"" doesnt make Bjork sound like she's bringing sexy back but instead like she's a bystander in her own song & things just get worse with the rest of the album sounding like elaborate B-sides. The only ray of hope after the first 3 songs is the Bjork meets Atari Teenage Riot ""Declare Independence"" if you like industrial music you'll adore this song.So whats a Bjork fan to do? Just take the 4 good songs from Volta, combine them with the 4 good songs from Medulla, throw them together on your mp3 player & what you have is a full-length Bjork album worthy of 5 stars or just rush out & buy the Coco Rosie album ""Adventures of Ghosthorse & Stillborn""(Bjork used to make full-length albums this good once)"
3,Typical Bjork,I didn't like the duets as they don't have the power of Bjork's other songs. Bkork's songs are strange and moving.
4,Good stuff...,"While it's not nearly her best work, there's enough memorable stuff on the album to keep me coming back. While I found Medulla to be a bit bland and mellow, there's enough energy in most of Volta's tracks to make Bjork welcoming and catchy once again. Don't let the reviews fool you, this is some great music. Bjork just appeals to very...critical tastes. Which isn't necessarily a bad thing."
3,ugh...,"i have every album and all i can say is that this one is my least favorite. i don't feel that i need to prove my love for bjork by force feeding myself this album. i gave it 3 stars by default (because frankly i have nothing but a mother's love for bjork) and i blame matthew. call me old fashion, but i miss her amazing powerful vocals (unravel, unison, like someone in love, who is it, hyper-ballad, etc). i know growth is needed, but i think she is getting careless."
3,Everyone seems to either love it or hate it. I'm the exception - I'm right in the middle.,"I love Bjork - but Volta is pretty weird self-indulgent stuff. There are moments of shocking brilliance and a few very good songs. That just makes the long meandering patches and weird duets harder to take. I keep listening and hoping that with familiarity this album will ""take"" (sometimes an album I can't stand at first ends up being a favorite over the long haul - like ""After the Goldrush"" by Neil Young). So far (6 months later) I still find this album strong meat and tend to skip a lot of tracks. I still love Bjork - but I can't seem to find my love for this one."
3,"Eh, it was OK.","Maybe I'm just too hung up on POST, but nothing seems to compare to me like that album. Don't get me wrong, it's a good disc, I'm just not as impressed as with her former efforts. I would though share it with a friend. It's a good album to just play and let run while you're doing something else...like vacuming your car or something."
2,"God, I hate doing this","I reiterate my title: I hate doing this. Fact is I am very disappointed in this album, as was I with her last album. Maybe it's me, but I just don't get it. It seems like concept album after concept album here. The vocal melodies all sound very similar to each other and that of past albums, but yet don't grab hold of you as one would hope. Some of the songs are hard to even sit through due to over-emphatic tech beats and cloudy progression. I just didn't get that warm feeling of ""I can't wait to listen to this louder in my car"" feeling as I normally would get listening to her. Again I apologize I have seen Bjork in concert in Boston, I think she is gorgeous and brilliant, but I just can't recommend this album."
2,Boring,"I too used to be a big Björk fan. From Debut to Vespertine, she only got better. Vespertine was a real masterpiece. Volta is OK, Earth Invaders is a good song, but most of the other songs are just boring and, having other albums to listen to, why would I bother with this one? It's sad, although after Medulla I didn't expect much from Björk. I totally agree with the reviewer who wrote that this album is as annoying as its cover art."
5,Still blowing my mind,"Bjork is still doing well, and producing great music. Buy this album, you won't be disappointed."
2,I hate this album = (,"Bjork is one of my favorite artists, but Earth Intruders is the only good song on this album. When I first popped the CD in, I was really excited on hearing the first song, Earth Intruders, hoping the rest of the album would be similar, or at least in the same class.I agree with others who think this is artsie-fartsie crap. It's as if she's trying a little too hard to be essentric and not making the beautiful music she once did.Many of the songs are just disjointed noises. There is no melody and her singing doesn't flow with the music. Bjork, you're one of the few talented musicians out there, please get back to making music! This has been two very disappointing albums in a row from Bjork."
2,More Experimenting,"I took a chance with this new CD after the experimental piece ""Medulla"" where the music was generated by humans making noises/beat boxes.Volta goes back to electronic beats somewhat like Debut/Post. Some of it is very interesting and original.But thats where the good ends. This CD has some interesting programming and sounds that pretty much repeat themselves. The brass band is hit or miss.The main problem with this album is that Bjork somewhat sings or talks over each song that makes it sound like she recorded herself to different music and just mixed it together. The vocals are too raw and don't play along with the music. I would listen get into the music and just wish she would shut up after a while.Where has the vocal integration gone from Vespertine and Post?This Bjork album has turned into is the electronic experimental version of a Jewel CD where the lyrics don't match up or make any sense."
3,A good album,"If you are a Bjork fan then you must buy this CD. If you aren't a fan then perhaps her earlier works may be more suitable. I heard the cd 10 times before writing this review. There are some good songs on this CD. I love the fact that she has introduced horns and strings to this cd, a welcome relief after Medulla. Even though it is a good album, I would not rate it as brilliant as some of her previous albums are.After repeatedly listening to the cd, I played some of her earler albums for a comparison ie Vespertine and Selmasongs. To me there was no comparison.Still, it is Bjork - one of the most original artists of today and Volta has a cosy place next to all her other albums on my cd rack."
2,"Almost, but not quite","I REALLY wanted to love this album. I absolutely adore ""Vespertine,"" and thought it was her most comprehensive album, flowing from one song to the next...a complete work. When ""Medulla"" totally disappointed, I still had high hopes for the next album - surely Bjork wouldn't release TWO clunkers in a row! In a nutshell, I had to try very hard to like ""Volta""...and my efforts paid off - sort of. The first five tracks grew on me. In fact, the first five songs rock, but the rest of the album falters...too out there, not enough melody, and the song about the suicide bomber had lyrics that were WAY too obvious and strange to hear coming out of Bjork's beautiful mouth. All in all, I listen to the first five tracks and then rewind."
2,Yawn,"This is the most fundamentally boring thing Björk has ever recorded. I don't know what the sales figures were like for Medulla (which I loved), but they must have been pretty dire to have inspired such milquetoast pandering. I've listened to it about four times now and I still cannot remember a single song on it apart from ""Earth Intruders,"" and that's only because the lyrics are so embarrassingly bad that I find myself blushing while listening to it--even when alone. Granted her words have always been infused with a sort of language barrier inspired comedic naiveté, but this is just plainly awful. It gets an extra star only because she refrained from making references to reproductive fluids this time around (at least I think she did)."
2,Bjork's Volta CD review,Maybe 2 good songs and the rest is only mediocre. Still not as good as her early stuff.
1,"DO NOT BUY IT, GARBAGE","Soooooo disappointing!I have no words to express it.I love everything she has done in the past, cherish and deeply love her music, consider her a Goddess.However this CD is an absolute trash.Wherever she is experimenting with, is OH, so not working.Her singing is flat and, no heart in it. She waisted Timbaland's talent!Do NOT BUY the CD, she should learn a lesson, get her touch back or go away.Sorry Bjork! What a waste."
3,Only a few duds...,"The thing with this cd is that there are a few stupid songs mixed in with a bunch of real nice tracks. It's not as bad as some reviewed it but there are a few duds here instead of a solid, all the way through, album. Buy it used. It is worth it for the Bjork fan."
4,A VERY strong return to form,"If you've been a little befuddled by Bjork's work in recent years, fear not: this one, while not a step back as far as her first couple of records, is her most accessible work in a long time, especially for fans of her ""weird lite"" style, and not so much her ""smash glass typerwriters"" take on music.It's a tight record, with compelling, driven songs, and if you're a fan of her singing this record showcases her in fine form.If you've been hiding form her, pick it up. She's not forgotten you."
2,Disappointing,"It's nice to see so many favorable reviews by Bjork fans for this. I've always been a huge Bjork fan, but Volta is just a major disappointment for me. It's just dreadful. Yes, she's an artist and she should continue to make the art that expresses herself. I've just lost interest. Over the last three CDs Bjork has done little more than her classic Bjork sing-song melody over increasingly boring backgrounds. The two duets with Antony on Volta are simply excruciating to sit through. For me, there's just nothing of interest here. I envy those fans who are able to roll with this one. Me...I just give up at this point."
4,play a volta!,"i have always enjoyed bjork for what she gives to the world through her music. i don't ever want to take her too seriously or overanalyze her. i'm sure she doesn't enjoy that either.i appreciate her encounters with timbaland, particularly 'innocence'. that song is a lot of fun and i can't wait for the remixes to start spinning at the clubs. it's going to make for some great, saucy dancing!i also got a huge rise out of the song 'vertebrae by vertebrae'. the insistent stamping and those accents on the second beat are delicious!"
3,Voltage,"Be it not for the little slices of heaven on this LP:""Declare Independence""""Earth Intruders""this collection would be refuse.Timbaland is a joke. I don't like the way Björk has travelled here.Be it not for her voice, and the two tunes mentioned, this LP would receive 1 star.I still love you Ms. Gudmunsdottir, and I look forward to meeting you again, on your next adventure."
2,I'm done with her now,"Another album with the same vocal riffs we've all heard before with little or no harmonic movement underneath. Björk's moxie has carried this formula with diminishing success for the past few albums, but I've had enough. To her credit, she always brings some new acoustic texture or idea to the mix, but in the end, her caterwauling against an unchanging tonal center is old, old, old.Björk is a talented vocalist, but it is a shame she has eschewed solid songwriting in favor of coasting on the same vocal acrobatics."
1,No no no... I need more,"I need more something.. more of the spectacular that she used to bring with such force. I'm so very disappointed in this CD. I liked the first song, could force myself to listen to the second then I just wanted to cry through the rest of the recordings. I guess I am just not capable of enjoying her ""artistry"" anymore. Pity."
1,Third Dud In A Row For Bjork,"Pretty sad. Her fist album that sounded as though she finally ""woke up"" and sang with a backbone again based on ""Earth Intruders"" and the album turns out to be a real poor effort. Probably the poorest effort in her entire career. Hopefully someday Bjork will come back with real material."
1,Mostly unlistenable,"Okay, I love Bjork and regard her as being a genius, etc. etc. But I've lived with this thing for awhile and just erased it from my playlist, all of it. Aside from a couple of songs that are dim echos of better work (""I See"", ""My Juvenile""), I find the rest of it down right unpleasant. Two CD's in a row doesn't mean she's finished, but it's apparent she's searching for something new rather than just repeating what she did so well . . . and so far failing badly. I can't fault her for trying, but I can't listen to this anymore."
4,I liked it,"I thought this was good, and definately has Bjork's flare. However, I'm saddened to say that I think this may have been my least favorite CD of hers . I think she's a great composer and poet. But she sounds ""tired"" or ""aged"" in this one."
5,Jan E.,We have been drinking Clipper Teas exclusively for 2 years and it is consistently the best tea we've ever had. Our guests have requested the name of the tea after having it at our home because of it's excellent taste and quality. Our favorite is the White Tea with Cinnamon. We can't recommend it enough.
4,Most tunes were great.,"I liked this album and I think it was severely underrated. The only song you ever hear from OMC on the radio is ""How Bizarre,"" which is a great song, but other songs on the album were great too. The only part on this album that I didn't like was that some of the songs were long and repeditive, but for the most part, OMC made a terrific album."
1,OMC IS A ONE HIT WONDER AND THATS ALL THEY WILL EVER BE,ALL I CAN SAY IS THIS CD IS BIZZARE IN A BAD WAY TALK ABOUT A ONE HIT WONDER THIS GUY HAS NO TALENT I BOUGHT THIS CD BECAUSE I THOUGHT IT WOULD HAVE CATCHY BEATS AND COOL DANCE TOONS AND IT DIDN'T IT ONLY HAD ONE SONG WHICH GETS ANNOYING AFTER A FEW DAYS. I DON'T RECOMMEND THIS TO ANY ONE AT ALL.
3,Why did I do it?--Why did I do it?,"I sincerly hope that ""OMC"" is active and creating back in his own country and we MTV lamos have just lost track of him due to our top-ten-sensitive-only-radar. This album showed glimmers of what could be a real talent two more albums down the road and perhaps they've already been released outside the U.S.. The first two tracks were great--I dig ""Ten more Minutes"" better than ""How Bizzarre"". But everything after that seems a bit lazy and half-baked. Overall though the album is quite listenable."
3,It has it's moments.,"I bought ""How Bizarre"" the cd for ""How Bizzare"" the song used for 99 cents-not bizarre at all. There are a few good numbers- the title track, ""Angel in Disguise"" and the hidden Randy Newman number ""I Love LA"" among some others. Overall, the CD can wear on you. Too much redundancy within a couple of songs that go nowhere. Buy it used for as cheap as possible and you probably won't be disappointed."
2,Bizarre,"I really wish ""How Bizarre"" had been released as a single, because it was the novelty one-hit fluke. Indications are present in this one hit about how the rest of an album's worth of material couldn't really be very good; for starters, not only does this guy not have a good singing voice, he can't even *talk*!"
1,VH1 one hit wonder,just like the title cut it was Bizarre that OMC even blew up in the first place.very boring&a one trick pony through out.VH1 awaits them in a very few short years.
3,"2 songs are good, the rest are OK!","Well, I had heard ""How Bizarre"" on the radio and I liked it enough to buy the CD. WARNING NO OTHER SONGS ON THE CD SOUND LIKE HOW BIZARRE! But some of them are pretty good, with nice beats. Pauly's voice is not so great, but the songs with Zina's backups, such as #2 and #8, are better. The only song i really dont like is the last one on the cd, ""She loves Italian"""
5,Kiwi music is cool,"All around excellent cd. Only odd moment is the last track, otherwise I find this to be a joy to have playing while drivingaround. It reminds me of the stereo mcs.....just a tad."
4,The whole C.D. is great but How Bizzare and On The Run best,I started out only buying this C.D. for How Bizzare but then I realized it had other great tracks like On The Run and Never Coming Back. the band is great because you can hear all sorts of instrements used and I like variety.
5,"YOU ARE SO GREAT! WE LOVE YOU, WE LOVE NEW ZEALAND.","I like the music and your voice so much, when we are enjoy your song, just like you can make everything going well. OMC, we love you."
5,"Different sound, Good lyrics",I found OMC's music to be original and not so mainstream. I like the entire CD.
3,"Good science, bad philosophy","Very interesting, indeed; an easy tale of the marveluos brain, for the begginer. On the other side, philosophical problems are poorly treated, despite the fact that the authors intend to bring out a conclusion on items open since thinking began....Nor Spinoza, nor Wittengestein (both cited in the book) could breach the bridge between matter and thinking, and pointing out the marvelous numbers involved in brain structure or functionality does not solve the problem: how matter ""is"", or ""become"" thinking. It does not seem to be a matter of numbers, there is no conclusive answer for that in the history of philosophy. It is a pitty that the autors feel so confident on their conclusions. I strongly recommend its reading, and not only because that ancient problem can be seen again within the studies of the brain structure and functionality: it seems to me a fine book."
3,'Backward Thinking' (when Matter becomes Imagination),"I have not read this book (even though the title initially interested me) but just reading the subtitle ""How Matter Becomes Imagination"" is about 'backward thinking', since the way energy works positively in humans is that, the subtle-energy (Imagination or memory) programs or ""becomes"" ""Matter"" (E=MC2)...WHEN the ""Matter"" becomes our ""Imagination"" we are stuck!"
3,"Good Anime,Good Storyline,Disappointing Ending","I found the anime to have a well done story and good anime but the endingof the series left a lot wanting it really does not answer any of the questions you have about the girls,organization,or what well become of themso if you don't like open endings or frustrating ones I would wait on thisanime but if you can get past this the series is amazingly very good"
3,Buyer Beware,"My main problem with this anime is the lack of action. This could have easily have been an live-action movie but then who would have seen it. Beware of ""vanity reviews"" from people who want to be thought of as ""high-brow"" reviewers. This anime is run of the mill without the action and only has going for it a pathos premise that's a one trick pony. If you must, see only the first disc --rent it from netflix!"
4,Pretty alright.,"It starts off building an emotional bond between the characters before you. The animation (for Season 1 anyyways) is great, and the story catches on later. However its only downfall was that in Season 2 their budget goes down immensely and the whole art style you grew accustomed to completely changes for the worst. Overall it's a good buy because to finish the show you have to have.. well basically everything in this series. S1,S2/Ova. Well worth it, just expect a few changes."
5,Excellent,Everything was as expected got the package on time and in excellent shape. Mountain dew is the best drink ever made
5,"Caliban ""the Great""",You must have this album and you must have their first full lenght album A Small Boy and Grey Heaven. They deserve support !!!!Caliban rocks.
4,Caliban not quite Killswitch,"Yes, it's true, Caliban and Killswitch Engage have very similar sounds, but no, Caliban is not better, nor are they any less repetetive. The screaming vocals are almost identical to that of Killswitch, and Booster (Caliban's lead singer) doesn't have anything close to the quality of voice as that of Howard Jones (Killswitch lead). Both being good bands, Caliban is definitely a good buy."
2,Better live,"I saw this band live and was blown away. Immediately, I picked this CD up from them. All I have to say is that I was highly disappointed. The songs are good and have great potential, but the entire disc was horribly recorded. They definitely needed to boost the guitar levels on this album. I could barely make out what they were playing."
4,Revenge is a dish best served cold&#65533;,"This is an expertly written story of Sam Di Paolo, a man whose driving desire is to bring down those who ruined him. The intricacies of the legal profession are interestingly woven through a plot that is both exciting and realistic. The reader is well exposed to the world of fraudulent personal injury cases, and this terrible smirch on the legal system is exposed with gritty and unsettling detail.In the tradition of John Grisham and Earl Stanley Gardner, Jerre Morganti guides us through the world of law and courtroom battlegrounds. A good read, and recommended to anyone who enjoys intrigue and suspense."
4,From a fan of the third edition,"Allen's third edition was one of those reference books that you develop a personal relationship with. It was small enough to get to know, and quirky enough to require getting to know. This fourth is a committee effort, bigger, more authoritative, more up to date. I doubt that I will develop a warm affection for it, as I did it's predecessor, but I will use it just the same."
5,This is the next level for Down The Line!,This CD features catchy songs with great harmonies and a wide array of different styles. A great follow-up to Welcome To Flavortown. This is the next level for Down The Line!
4,Love the movie...but the soundtrack?,"I am a huge fan of the movie and the soundtrack is also amazing...the only thing I'm uspet about is that ""One Last Kiss"" on the cd is TOTALLY different!"
4,Nice,"The sheets are nice... but not amazing. The color is shimmery so it doesnt match anything perfectly. The white sheets are more of a pearl color. Comfort wise, they are very soft. The smell funny when you first get them- it took 2 washings with febreeze in the wash to get the smell out.Overall- they are a good deal for high thread count sheets at their current price. Full price, I would think twice."
2,very high thread count with the feel of a cheap t-shirt,"don't buy this if you are looking for the luxury feel of hotel sheets. even though this has a very high thread count it has the feel of a cheap t-shirt. i'm no expert, but i think the cotton should be mercerised or at least combed.otherwise, it's fairly high quality and thick.so, it will last me forever, i'm afraid..."
4,"Great, but not as said to be...","The sheets fit perfectly. Washed twice and came out of the dryer wrinkled both times. White matches anything and they are just white not really shimmery. Hard feeling because they are so thick but soft once you get into them...would not say extrodinarily soft...but comfortable yes. Wonderful for winter but just as good for summer. Took a few blankets off the bed once we used the sheets. I don't think they were described to the ""T"" but still they are great sheets I think."
3,"good camera, little improvements needed",in the new model you have the visor and wheel for choosing camera options that was missing in this model
3,"Good camera, but...","I purchased this camera and was at first, delighted with it. The LCD screen is huge, it's got many user functions, and it's easy to use while still giving you many options. It's easy to charge, and view pictures, even though the attached software is nothing too advanced. The user manual is lacking---about ten pages of how to charge the camera, nothing really on the many special functions.The main reason I gave this camera a 3 and not a 5 is suddenly, yesterday--it stopped working. I try to turn on the camera and the screen says ""SYSTEM ERROR (Oe01)"" and refuses to work!!! I'm going to try resetting it, or calling Casio, but it's really annoying that I ordered this (not cheap, mind you) camera less then three weeks ago, and already there are problems. Has anyone else had this problem? I really, really, REALLY don't want to have to buy a new camera."
2,Indoor shots are mediocre,"I forgot when I purchased this camera in 2006 that high MegaPixel does not always equal quality photos. Outdoor with natural light the pics are just peachy. Indoor, they are grainy. Perhaps some of that is the LCD--but it is advertised as a ""display that brings out the true brilliant quality of the pictures"". So I have to believe that the issue is the camera itself.We've used it for years, but found ourselves using our cel phones instead, since they took better pictures in almost all cases.I realize that this is now ""old technology,"" but it certainly makes me think twice about purchasing Casio again."
5,Excellant Camera,"The screen is the largest and clearest I have seen. Camera is easy to use with many features to choose from. Includes some fun features. Mico feature is crystal clear (beautiful for flowers, insects, etc). Has a fun feature which puts 2 of the same object in the photo. Took a picture of my son pointing in one direction and then the second picture of him making a face in the direction of himself pointing - comes together in one picture - Fun! Battery last a very long time (and I take a lot of pictures). Small and easy to carry and handle. The only con: Does not print the date on the picture. Everything else about the camera a excellant! Very happy with it."
1,NOT for indoor picture-taking,"I purchased this camera despite reading reviews that said it takes poor quality indoor pictures. I should have listened. I had it for 3 days before returning it to Amazon. My old Canon S400, that I've had for almost 3 years and is only a 4mp camera, takes better quality indoor pictures by far. I actually took side by side pictures to compare and the backgrounds of the Casio pictures were very grainy, even in the highest resolution. I'm sure without flash in daylight, the quality might be better, but I didn't waste my time trying it, as I take most of my pictures indoors. I am going to purchase a new Canon SD450 instead, as I never had any complaints about the quality of my Canon photos."
4,Very informative.,"This a very informative book on pewter, of course. As usual it doesn't have as many marks as I would have liked. That was not a big surprize as none of the books do. When will someone write a book that contains all of the marks in a easy to read and understand format? Question of the century?"
3,Environmentally friendly way to kill weeds,The ON/OFF valve does not work. This is not a big deal since you canjust unscrew the propane bottle when you are finished. This is a greattool for killing weeds! Faster and cheaper than chemicals - not tomention much better for the environment.
5,The original and the best,"Of the three albums the girls have released this one is the best. The blend of great vocals, harmonies, excellent writing talents and the relaxing mood of the album leads to an amazing listening experience. Some of the best songs on here were never released as singles, such as ""Just The Way You Like It"" and ""Stone In My Shoe"" A brilliant band with huge talent"
3,"Sweet and Sinister, but just OK","I bought this CD after a quick sampling at a used CD store in Brazil. The vocal harmonies are great, some fun lyrics, but the songwriting isn't really 100%.The main theme of the album is kind of a little girl, Alice In Wonderland fantasy with an edge. Lot of mentions of ""The Big Bad Wolf"" or ""Him"". The first 4 tracks really set the tone:""Irresistable"" introduces to the power of the girls' unique vocals that kind of sound like The Cranberries meet the Cardigans.""Intense"" is definitely the stand out track, with its in your face harmonies and heavy synths.""I Am, I Feel"" is a fun girl power song, where they sing about getting revenge on a guy who treats them bad.""Alisha Rules the World"" is the title track & has a trippy, but catchy hook.The rest of the album just meanders off into silliness, it's not a great album overall-but I haven't gotten rid of it yet, so that's saying something."
2,Too un-original,"I bought this album after an inspiring performance on the Village Stage of 1997's Lilith Fair, and I am disappointed. While these two girls have great voices, their music is too run-of-the-mill."
1,no no no!,"this is absolute rubbish pop. there is not 1 decent track. they seem to have gone out of their way to create the most ANNOYING synthesizer tones ever! they seem to be a awful clone of all saints, the spice girls and eternal"
5,"How do you say, ""I laughed my *&^% ass off"" in Japanese?","As author ofLiving In Yen: How Not to Move to Japan Gracefully, I must say this book is dead-on about Japan through an American's eyes. I am so jealous that Dave Barry had his family, a tour guide, and a trip paid for by his publisher... I had none of those things (one reason I wasn't graceful). Still, I can set aside my envy and laugh uncontrollably about Barry's shenanigans, knowing full well the desire to find a Kentucky Fried Chicken after only two days in that wonderful country. I miss it like hell, and when I'm in the mood for a piece of raw, chewy squid, I pick up this book. It makes me choke every time (with laughter, that is)."
3,Dave Berry Doesn't REALLY *DO* Japan,"Yes, this book was hilarious. And no, it wasn't cruel and laughing AT the Japanese.That said, I do not think Dave Berry really DOES Japan. In order to fully experience Japan, one must escape their Americanness. Taking an English nightlife tour of Tokyo, going to resort touristy town, and riding a BUS up Fujisan does not constitute ""doing"" Japan. I really think the book would have been MUCH better if Berry and his family experienced Japan the lonley planet way -- not the fodors way. . ."
4,Funny if dated,"Dave Barry wrote this book in the 80s--when the Japanese were apparently taking over the economic world and Americans were trying to salvage some self respect in comparison to their more efficient Eastern neighbors (this, of course, was before Japan entered their 10-year recession of the 1990s and America went in search of other economic rivals like China and India).The book is really quite funny in the first few chapters. Especially Dave Berry's discussion of Kanji and Kabuki theater. My wife, who teaches Japanese, reads it to her students after exams. Later, he has to emphasize how the Japanese are very homogeneous, which is true--but the discussion is as funny. Barry tries to emphasize how despite their superior efficiency, Japanese don't always have as much fun as us Americans.Overall, I think it's still a fun book to read if you're headed to Japan. And Dave Berry, as we all know, is definitely one of the great comedic writers of our time."
2,"Pretty lazy effort, overall...","... but at least he admits he's being lazy!Dave Barry has always struck me as the 'guy' version of Erma Bombeck. You always know when the twist / joke is coming, and a little goes a long way."
2,Frat Boy Travelogue - Why Bother,"About as funny as hanging with some ""Ugly American"" Frat boys on your first trip abroad. You know, the kind that just can't get over that the French use mayonnaise on Pommes Frites and that the beaches are topless (""Boy, these people are WILD!"") .Barry does use Japan to take a hard look at American values and attitudes and the book does succeed there. But, he totally misses the Japanese spirit, mocking Shinto Temples as places too boring for him, and Sumo as nothing more than a bunch of naked fat guys wrestling (its not: its built on centuries of tradition and involves nuances and martial arts techniques lost on Barry).And food? He spends the whole trip in Japan -- a country with a rich culinary tradition --eating nothing but KFC and Pizza and mocking the rest. Hee Hee, Ha Ha.There is humor in Japan, but not in this Book. I only hope its never translated into Japanese. Its an embarrassment."
5,My favorite Barry,"Perfect Barry. His description of how the Japanese airline treated him, his suggestion for how best to learn to speak Japanese (I won't spoil it), his description of Americans' perception of themselves ""tromping and pooping all over the [Japanese] garden"" - hilarious.I wish the publisher's prices for the Kindle versions weren't so darn high. I guess I'll keep buying the hardbacks. Drop those prices and I'll buy the book AGAIN for the Kindle - it always makes me laugh."
3,"Funny, but short","This is the first (and only) book by Dave Barry that I've read. It was funny--I laughed out loud several times more than one would expect for such a short book--but I would definitely not recommended as one's sole diversion during a plane trip to Japan from the U.S. You'd be done before Hawaii.It's also in a somewhat awkward position in the post-Made in America/Rising Sun/Japan That Can Say No era, as any American who still has more than a passing interest in Japan will no doubt know most if not all the cultural tidbits upon which Mr. Barry's anecdotes are based, thus negating some of the humor/shock value that the book might otherwise provide."
3,Not Barry's best but still some good laughs,"Dave Barry is a very funny guy and Japan is a place with some custom's peculiar to Westerners. So I was expecting him to really take off with this book. It was hilarious in places, but not consistently funny. Worth picking up, especially if you are interested in Japan. But not Barry's best stuff."
5,The Best Of dave Barry Does Japan,"Without bothering to get approval from the President, the State Department, or even the FTC, Dave Barry's publishers sent him to Tokyo. You'd think they would have known better. Now the word is Barry has set back our diplomatic relations with the whole Pacific Rim by a couple of decades. Japanese culture, dining, sport, and industry all come under Barry's relentless scrutiny. So if you think President Bush committed a social gaffe by losing his composure and his lunch in front of the Japanese Prime Minister, wait until you hear Barry's commentaries. And if you're planning a trip to Japan, don't leave home without Barry's pearls of wisdom about the mysterious East."
3,Good for a giggle,"If you've ever lived in Japan, like I have, you will find this a bit too light. It was good for a giggle, but that's all. Nothing to take too seriously. I think I finished it in a day or two."
5,Laughed so hard I cried,"This book is so honest, irreverent and hilarious. I laughed so hard I was crying. As an American who spent time in Japan as an exchange student, I could totally relate to many of his experiences, goofs, reactions and thoughts. Classic Dave Barry and my favorite of his works."
4,not one of his best but still good,"Humor columnist Dave Barry takes on Japan and its culture in this hilarious book. Shortly after deplaning, he notices something impressive. No, not the architecture. He seems to be the tallest person in the area. He's tempted to get a basketball and carry it with him, but that temptation passes. With the same ready wit, he describes the experience of ""mincing"" in hotel slippers (shoes are forbidden), visiting pools of hot mud, trying to bridge the language barrier, searching for something vaguely edible, and realizing that the Japanese, as a people, have a long way to go before they achieve the same sophomoric heights of humor and aggressive nonconformity that Americans do so effortlessly - like Barry."
5,laugh out loud funny,I had tears in my eyes reading this one. While sharing his experience in Japan he manages to actually enlighten and be devastatingly funny at the same time. It made me want to go to Tokyo and see for myself.
4,A look back at the way movies were in the '50's...,I remember going to this movie when it first came out...I took my grandmother and got a lot of noise from school mates about my cool date??!! I enjoy good black and white photography and seeing the old actors. Multicultural/diverse...anything but but that's actually the way my world was growing up in small town Louisiana way back when.
3,Not As A Stranger,"People may not agree with me on this movie, but it's still one of my favorites. Olivia d'Haviland did an awesome job, as always, in her role as a rejected wife. Frank Sinatra made his role as though it was his own. He seemed very comfortable playing a serious role, and I believe this was one of his first.Although this is one of my favorite Robert Mitchum movies, the one thing I dislike the most is how robotish Robert is. It's like each word, each movement, each cue is ordered and he just appears so stiff and unreal, almost like he just detests everything he has to do."
1,Loosely based on some possible stories,"This is a book loosely based on some of the things that people in The Living Theatre may have done until 1985. All but the last chapter trods already well-worn ground of the ""crazy"" Living Theatre, and says nearly nothing about the work itself. The Living Theatre has continued to work and grow up until the present day (2008), and nearly nothing is mentioned about what they have learned and created since the mid 1970s. For more scholarly treatments, consult some of the avant-garde studies of Shank, Aronson, or Innes. Or better yet, go see the current Living Theatre for yourself on Clinton Street in Manhattan."
5,Awsome!,"Convenient for coffee and appetizers. I bought so they match my other barcelona cutlery set. 6 in packet, well spaced, traveled well. They are brushed stainless steel and measure about a 1/4 of teaspoon."
3,Picture is wrong. You will get a different model,"The picture in this item is wrong. You will not get the 24"" wingspan version pictured, but instead the you will get the cheaper, die-cut 20"" version. Very deceiving."
2,digital OTC Battery load tester,It would be a much better product if it would take inputs to test load batteries with different Cold Cranks.
1,Poor quality control,"I ordered this item hoping to receive a quality product that I could use for years. As it is, I can't even use it once. I opened the box and the first thing I noticed was the rattling sound from inside the metal case. I could see a metal plate floating around inside, so the unit is unusable. Also, it was packed inadequately and has shipping damage. It feels like it is a quality unit, except that the quality control is non-existent. I'm returning it as soon as I can."
4,great music,"The CD was great. I was really disappointed though. One of the greatest pieces in the show wasn't on it. The first fiddle section wasn't included in the soundtrack. Almost like a battle of the violists, those two girls were so amazing and the music itself was awesome. If I could change the CD at all, the only thing I would do would be to add another track! Otherwise, I wouldnt change a thing."
4,Forever dancing in our hearts!!!,"Wow! I got LOTD for my birthday and it blew me away. What else can I say? The music was incredible. The only thing that kept it from getting 5 stars was that it didn't have DANGEROUS GAME and HELL'S KITCHEN. I heard somewhere that it was based on an actual Irish legend. Is that true? If so, PLEASE contact me and tell me where I can find it. Don Dorcha rocks!"
5,Nothing compares to this,"I have seen LotD live 5 times (and going for a 6th in less than a month)...I have met the dancers on several occasions and appreciate all the heart and soul they put into the show. This cd captures the essence and beauty of the show, but I agree that it would be better with taps throughout...that is an important part of the music too."
3,Some of it's really good-but I don't think it's very Celtic.,"Well, I saw most of the video at a friend's house. It was very weird. Like ""Oh look, they're dancing at each other again!"". But I really like some of the music, especially Gypsy and Warriors. I think Riverdance is more Irish, and the dancing's more impressive. I mean, one-handed back handsprings?! Yow!"
5,The Best Ever!!!!,I think that Michael and Ronan have done a great job on this soundtrack....the Video was great and the soundtrack is just as well done...a must have!!
3,Where's the Clogs?!,"Okay, let me just say this right out: This is fantasitc music. Wonderful Celtic sound (with a little pop and jazz thrown in here and there) and it's simply an amazing collection of songs. So, why the low rating, you ask? Simple: This IS Riverdance (the sequel anyway) and part of Riverdance's sound that I love so much is the ""clogging."" That's right, the clickey click and stomps of the dancers feet... it's like a whole precussion section. And, aside from the two ""bonus"" tracks, it's been totally omitted!! I can't understand why, and no one will ever be able to convince me or sell me a good reason. There's no excuse. I mean, listen to the first track, then listen to the ""bonus"" track of the same title with the clogging, and I'm sure you'll agree the clogging adds a wonderful element to the whole song, making it better, giving it that ""oomph"" it needs.So, I recommed this, in spite of my low rating, if you can learn to love ""the Riverdance sound"" without the Riverdance clogging."
3,Lord of the Dance Soundtrack,"I was truly blessed when I watched Lord of the Dance for the first time. I watch it over and over! The music combined with the sound of the dancers set my spirit soaring! I would sit and just listen with my eyes closed getting chills up and down me! I thought what a great thing - a soundtrack I can take with me. Much to my disappointment the total ""Soundtrack"" was not there. It just isn't the same without the sound of the dancers. Just exactly like it is in the video. Maybe you could put out an unedited version that leaves the dancers in with the music. I love the show, but am disappointed with this tape. Sorry :("
4,Just what I expected,"I purchased this CD for my brother. I have had the same CD since I saw this show live and fell in love with the music. We love it! There are only a few tracks with lyrics, the rest are all instrumental."
5,Captures the Excitement of Michael Flatley,"Beautiful throughout. You're instantly brought back to the excitement of the stage show (if you'd seen it... you know what I mean; if you haven't, catch it if you can) and I guarantee that Ronan Hardiman's beat will move you. This is one of my favorites next to trance instrumentals and Beethoven's Ninth."
5,"Great, but incomplete","My daughter is an Irish step dancer, and we've seen the traveling LOTD show. Her school performs to many of the songs. We also own the LOTD dvd. I just bought this disc for her for her birthday, and it is AWESOME...listening to it gives me goosebumps.My only negative comment is that the disc does not include all the songs from the show. In particular, the fiddle duet ""Strings of Fire"" is not there, which is one of my favorite parts of the show.Otherwise, I highly recommend it. I dare you to sit still while listening!"
3,Lord of the dance,"Great CD in its own right, but not as good as Ronan Hardiman's other compositions such as Solas or Anthem. Also, DO NOT buy this CD with Feet of Flames - you will think you paid twice for the same material...and you would be right."
3,"Un poco pretencioso, no?","Un poco pretencioso el título que se ha ""auto-asignado"" este hombre con eso de ""El señor de la danza""... Espéctaculo bastante lamentable y que poco tiene que ver con la tradición. En cuanto a la música, creo que hay recopilaciones de música celta mucho mejores, incluso trabajos como Riverdance. Aunque sigo prefiriendo los discos de Planxty, Silly Wizard o los de los Cunningham, por poner unos pocos ejemplos."
4,Lord of the Dance,"The product was delivered in excellent condition. I do wish that it had been placed in the correct category. I had wanted this product on DVD and that is what I searched for. I received it on CD. No doubt, it was because I failed to read the listing correctly but still......."
4,Great celtic songs,Very good songs but i have given 4 stars for the pieces of the middle aren't that good
1,All ego and no substance,"Sad that jokers like this have been able to cash in on the Celtic muisc boom of the past few years. The show is all ego and no substance, and there is far better Celtic music to be found out there rather than this tripe."
4,VTech v2656,"Whereas, the phone works fine, just have to be sure to keep it charged, because at a moment's notice it will have no charge. Love the speaker, answering machine, so except for battery being shortlived, it works fine."
5,"This phone system ""ROCKS"" !! Great Speakerphone !",I am a total phoneaholic...when ever I see a good phone I buy it. I like this phone I have this answering machine and then have 2 of the stand alones. I gave one to my mother in law and she also just loves it. I have no echo or battery problems after a few months. I love the speaker phone.I press the button and put the phone on my desk and do what I want...I dont even touch the phone durring the conversation. I can hear them very well from 10 feet away..and they can hear me if I raise my voice...good sound...and is loud enough.I use one phone with vonage.com and it works very well with that. Everyone can hear me...I ask them every time...crystal clear.Thank You Vtech your the best !
2,Can't hear a thing!,"I am not hard of hearing, but I cannot seem to hear well on this phone. I have two handsets and they're both the same. I can hear my voice echo back at me like I'm in a well and it's very distracting. In addition, the base handset will receive calls, but I can't get a dial tone to dial out. We've only had the phones for a few months, and I'm really disappointed. I'm online in search of a better phone."
2,v2656,I am also getting an echo.Not everytime but enough that its bothering me.I will most likely return this phone.To bad because its simplicity is great.
2,Mediocre at Best,"After a weeks ownership, here is my take on the VTech V2656.The VTech offers a lot of features for the money and the easy to use volume control is a plus, but the answering system, when contacted remotely from another phone only functions correctly half the time and battery life off the base is terribly short, on mine maybe 15 hours. I suggest you look elsewhere."
2,battery and Echo Problem,I just ignored perivous reviews about the echo and battery problem....But think what they were all right...Same issue with me
4,Great simple to use phone,"This phone has great sound quality (as good as corded)and is easy to operate. Has large buttons also a 'talk' and 'end' buttons instead of some phones that have a single button to answer and hang up, much better design so you don't have to second guess if you have hung up or not. Range is about the same as most 2.4 gig phones, more than the siemens phones. It doesn't techincal features like locking the keyboard nor a alphabetical directory, nor ability to name the handsets for easy paging (like the siemens). If it had these features it would be a five star to me."
2,"Not horrible, but not good.","I bought this phone a week ago, and I'll be returning it tomorrow. While the design is nice, the sound quality just isn't good enough. We don't have a microwave or wireless network in the house, we're out in the middle of the woods, so we're not getting interference from neighbor's phones, and the base station was consciously placed away from other electronics, so I expected a very clear voice on the other end of the phone. Unfortunately, this was asking too much; there was way too much hiss on the line, even when only a few feet from the base station.On several occasions, I would hear my voice echo while talking to other people. The speakerphone feature worked pretty well, but the speaker volume seemed to fluctuate. Without speakerphone, I found the volume to be far too quiet."
1,Disappointing,I love Claire. I would have preferred alittle more of Claire and less of the accompanist singing.
1,An Ill-Conceived Collaboration,"This is not the best CD that Claire has recorded. It is bland and offputtingly low-key, no thanks to the ill-conceived concept of a collaboration with the gravelly-voiced Bennett. Claire would have been better off doing with duets with other more exciting British jazz performers, many of whom abound and many of whom would have been more exciting than Bennett."
1,A Waste of Money,"Over the years I have collected Claire's recordings and have generally been very satisfied with her work. I find Claire to be a vibrant, lively, provocative singer who takes wondrous musical risks. Her CDs are generally appealing. This is not one of them.I have to agree with many of the reviews of this CD on this site. I was quite upset that less than half of the tracks feature Claire and of these few tracks, she sings duets with someone whose voice does not work well with Claire's. Although the CD credits both parties, the album cover is deceiving. It is not a Claire Martin CD. I would have preferred to have downloaded only the tracks with Claire's vocals. It would have cost me less money."
5,Nice refreshing beverage,I have been drinking this since receiving my order during my lunch breaks and my co-workers have been commenting on its wonderful smell and it really peps me up even though there's very little actual caffeine. I'm looking forward to my next cup already!
1,unpleasant after effects,"This tea smells nice and tastes great, but it always gives me a headache half an hour later. Will definitely not buy it again."
5,A Great Resource,This book is a good resource for jazz players. I thought it would have the fingerings for the chords (for beginners). But if you can read treble and bass clefs its great!!!! It has just about every possibility you can imagine!!!!
3,Starts good but turns into just another chord dictionary,"The reviews on Amazon were inaccurate. I purchased Jazz Piano Chords and found the book to have a reasonably useful standard chord explanation for first 28 pages. The remaining 100 pages are ALL chord dictionary for every key. Also, you better read music because every chord is shown on the G and F cleff. No note letters provided. What is disappointing to me was the very thin amount of real theory, explanation and discussion of jazz piano chords which is what the cover promised. For the $20. price, the value is simply not there. Much better alternatives are available from Amazon."
2,well...,"The author is trying to jump around on the concept he is trying to explain. Sometime, author used a long paragraph to explain a concept while at the end the point is still not clear.Examples in the text are not given in a consistent manner which causes lots of confusion to reader.Some important concepts are not presented in the text, unsymmetrical substitution in the conjugated system for example.I would recommend reader to read the book critically and do expect that things in the book are not 100% correct."
3,This book was clear but not outstanding.,"Everything mentioned in the book was explained very clearly, however many things mentioned in other intro books were not mentioned in this book. In other words, it dumbed things down a little bit. The book does have some interesting organic chemistry application pages."
2,cheaply made,"While it works fine, it really is very cheaply made. The buttons are ""touch-sensitive""-wanna-bes. The battery sits loosely. The door mechanism is flimsy.It does work well though with 4 different temp setting per day and weekend settings etc."
2,Buttons no longer respond,"This thermostat came new with the house we just bought, and it recently stopped working. None of the button responds anymore, so the only thing I can do is turn the blower fan on or off manually. I called Honeywell's customer support and we tried everything--replacing the batteries, resetting the device, etc--and nothing worked. The touchpad still does not respond at all. They told me I'd have to buy a new one. I had no problems programming it in the past, but I am disappointed that it only lasted a few months. I'd get a model that has a different style of buttons."
4,Review Probability Julie Seely,It's a good book. Well elaborated and efficent.I don't do maximun grade because it does not present the solutions of all problems.
5,Dolphin Connectors,Best connectors for secure connection of small wires. These have built in sealant making it best for outdoors applications. No special tools needed.
5,Totally Yummy,Yummy in our tummies! These are probably the best gfcf cookie I've tried. Great price at amazon.com too!
2,Not her best work.,"After reading some of Ms. Handelands's recent works (Blue Moon, Hunter's Moon) I picked up this book expecting the same wit and crisp writing. Even though I enjoy romance novels, I found this novel tedious and not worth reading in full. I did skim through it, and found some of the basis for her new series.I'm glad to see that Ms. Handeland's works have improved so much. Her recent werewolf books are almost on a par with the early Anita Blake books, but this one just wasn't worth the effort."
3,Heavy book and heavy reading,The book is very well written and gives a nice detailed background of Nokia. The book is however very hard to read since you have to look acronyms up and all the time divert your attention from the text too look at the many graphs. It is not a smooth read but the content of the book is very good and well documented.Cornelius SAMOHI
2,Dry,"I got this book hoping it would really expand my understanding of Nokia the company. It certainly does provide a lot of history about the company. If you're into that, you might like it. But if you're used to fater-paced books like those about Viacom, Blockbuster, Time Warner, Cisco, GE, etc. I don't recommend it."
1,What a shame!,"What a shame! This novel had potential. Some interesting subject matters - catholic marriage, football, academia. Some interesting locations - Los Angeles, Ireland, Prague, South America. Unfortunately, the result is a disjointed hotch potch followed by an inappropriate appendix. The work would benefit from an editor. Rather that the author had concentrated his main subject matter and locations to produce a novel in the genre of realism i.e. stick to football and USC!"
3,Needs An Interior Redesign,"Don't get me wrong this is a good collection of recipes not all of which are directly from church ladies.However, as a baker I prefer to see a presentation- a photo of the finished product. This edition has too many pictures of the cooks and not enough of the cooking. I was not expecting a Church fashion show! Maybe the writer could compromise and in a next edition put the baker with her product?The interior pages which were of a type of recycled non-luminious paper that was a bit hard on my eyes.dw"
3,"good basic info, but needs to be enhanced","There is enough information to get you started with basic household tasks. However, if you want to anything more advanced, like the previous reviewer's desire to add a subpanel, a few diagrams and pages of explanation would *really* help. The book really needs to be ""modernized""."
1,Outdated book lacking in some basic modern wiring,"This book is really just an old book on wiring that has a minimum of updates. The entire book has nothing about sub-panels or any reference to them. Photos/diagrams are outdated. If your building a chicken coop they have a chapter on that, other wise go for one of the new books out there."
4,this is not a review but a question for reviewers,hi just wondering if anyone can tell me which season has the episode where fred thinks he has menopause if any one know please post it here thanks derek
3,It's OK,The product was not what I expected and it took FOREVER for it to arrive. Way after the intended recipients birthday.
5,Sanford and Son - The First Season DVD,Redd Foxx is absolutely the best. I enjoyed watching Sanford and Son from I was 7 yrs. old. He made me laugh then and he's still making me laugh now. My 5 yr. old is now a big fan of Sanford and Son and not a day goes by without her asking to watch the DVD. Folks if you want to watch a real comedy sitcom this is the one for you. They are really not making them like this anymore. Trust me this is really worth your money.
3,Don't Remember Much of This First Season,"As a kid I absolutely loved Sanford & Son. There are so many episodes that stand out in my mind and I was pleased to find that a DVD was finally being made available. I was 11 years old when the first season originally aired on t.v. so I don't remember it very well. After watching this 2-disc set, however, I was disappointed that more supporting characters hadn't yet been introduced (I guess the 2nd season brought about the majority of those folks). Overall, it's a great walk down memory lane."
5,THE Best Comedy...PERIOD!,"What can you say about Sanford and Son? It is the best comedy ever produced! Like All In the Family, Sanford is a ground breaking series. The DVD sets, seasons 1 thru 5 are a must for S&S fans. All episodes are UN-CUT, what you see on TV (except original airs) are episodes with approx. 5 minutes cut from each episode. The trivia and quotes section is great. The picture quality and sound is A-1. BUY IT YOU BIG DUMMY!"
4,Sanford and Son - The First Season,"The first season of Sanford and Son is classic TV at its best. This set has fourteen episodes because it's a half-season set. Twelve of the episodes are adaptations of scripts from the British series Steptoe and Son. Redd Foxx is what makes this series work; he's funny, has impeccable timing in line delivery & is very opinionated. You can't help but love his character though it seems like he doesn't like anybody, including his own son.DVD quality is great but there aren't any bonus features. Episodes must be played individually, there isn't a play all command. Enjoy!"
5,Great DVD set,"Maybe I'm biased because I love Sanford and Son, but this DVD was great! PLEASE, PLEASE, Put out the second, third, etc... seasons on DVD. I would buy this DVD if you like San. and Son."
5,Here Comes The Big One,"This first season of Sanford and Son is the best! The episodes are hysterical, with Fred up to his usual old tricks, and Lamont being a big dummy. Get this and enjoy a good laugh."
5,Recommended Reading By nervegas.com,"This book is a good compilation of papers on Brucellosis. The facinating portions of this book reveal the phylogeny of different species and biovars of Brucellosis - tangible through genetic homogenicity. Furthermore, review of epidemiological data and the experiences of the contributors dispell two long-held opinions of the presentation of Brucellosis patients. Many medical texts report that Brucellosis is uniquely characterized by a persistent depression, which the contributors contend is no more remarkable than that with other disabling diseases. Also, 'Br abortus' has been long believed to present a uniquely high rate of spontanious abortion in pregnant patients, which again the contributors remark is not supported by the epidemiological evidence.I give the book a high rating for its excellent detail in presenting the signs and symptoms of Brucellosis, and its contemporary understanding of a classical disease that is still a problem for much of the world."
1,Topco cyberskin stroker triplets,"This item sucks, it's like wet unmanageable glogs or sticky crap. I recommend not wasting your money on this item"
2,They broke within a week,"I'm not impressed, within a week of use the screw on one of the ear pieces came out. word word"
1,Expirements Without The Appropriate Formula,"A diversion . . . a necessary side-step . . . a challenge to mentally mix it up a bit / a momentary alternative persona.Not an effort to be unapplauded, but it noticeably and sorely misses its intended target: Forging a bit of Americana into their previously well-claimed efforts of progressive / instrumental / avant-garde / layered pieces lacks any memorable ""punch"". Easily forgetable, and wouldn't be played much by one that has come to embrace the oh-so-creative, deep, and intellectual efforts so rich in both ""Things Shaped in Passing"" and ""The Exquisite Death of Saxon Shore"". I strongly suspect that they got the itch for this (""Casually Smashed to Pieces"") well scratched and purged from their system."
5,Great All Around,This product is awesome. It looks great! It has a rubber seal around the bottom of the lid so it fit better and sealed better than the stock lid! The chrome is high quality as you would expect from edelbrock!!!
5,A must read for professionals,"I needed this book for a training I was going to be doing through my work. Not only did the book arrive quickly, it was an easy read so I was able to get through the book quickly to learn what I needed for the training. Very useful and informative."
2,You get your money's worth,You get exactly what you pay for - cheap speakers. A plastic cover is already broken off and sound is very poor. Cheap price = cheap speakers.
4,A strong follow up to a dynamic debut,"Though I may agree that BiterSweet may not be as enjoyable (merely for the fact that the debut KIM Richey, was nearly flawless), it is certainly a great album by a highly talentled artist. This album features her crossover hit ""I Know"", which is socmething the debut can not claim. Richey's hit from the first album was ""Just My Luck"" which was widely recieved by country radio, but ""I Know"" made it continuously onto VH1, which I can recall the black and white video to this day. :) I highly reccomend this disc as comparred to ""Rise"" which i found to be a bit too experimental for Richey, though I admire her for trying new things. In addition to the debut and this release, my favorite Kim Richey release is ""Glimmer"", which features my fav song by her ""Keep Me"" as well as many other great song! Rock on Kimmy! :)"
5,SOLO Rolling Office,"Great product. I am using these to transport 5 large laptops. Very heavy when loaded, but easy to move by the rollers"
4,Seems good,"Seems good, and what we intended to order. Haven't had a chance to put it to the test as a ruptured achilles tendon took me out of commission and I had to cancel travel plans. But the handle seems sturdy, which was a concern, and the wheels appear to be well-made."
5,Excellent recording!,"This is the re-release of the CD, and I'm so happy to finally have a copy of it after waiting for so long! The music here is truly excellent - Lo's singing is very soulful and from the heart. He captures so many different moods, in all of his songs. The instrumentation is captivating, and there are parts that I dance to that remind me of Paul Simon's ""Graceland."" All of the songs on this album are great, but there are some I like more than others. Dibi Dibi Rek is just the best. The duet with Marianne Faithful is unforgettable. A must have!"
4,Jammu Africa soars high,"The title track is truly a moving emotional track that can't be played less than a dozen times or more over and over. Other tracks are excellent and will draw you into this artists experience. Really liked Tadiau Bone as well.This album will move you, bring you to tears or bring bright smiles. Considering that I am a 37 year old white guy from Flushing who grew up on Black Sabbath, AC-DC, and Rush, you can bet that Ismael Lo is for a very wide audience of music lovers. Find this album somewhere and buy it...it's hard to find nowadays."
3,Disappointed,"I have been trying to find a pair of leather, high heeled, rounded toe boots. These almost fit the ticket. However, the bronzed detail was so much so that it went clear through to the inner layer of the leather in several spots. I felt like they would not last very long with the shoe part already compromised."
3,Liquid Lightning Sugar FREE Energy Drink,"In my opinion, other energy drinks would be better than this. I wanted to try the sugar-free for personal reasons. I dont think it really had an effect on me, I drank 2 in a row everytime I needed it and I think I shouldve gotten the one with SUGAR in it. You might be better off buying Monster, Redbull or Jones Energy."
5,EXCELLENT !,This album is one of my favorites still enjoy listening to it to this day.. if you enjoy real r&b music that isnt watered down or r&b that is too mainstream.. this is it for you it doesnt get no better ! .. it has that later70's - early 80's vibe to it .. there is only one song that seems out of place on this collection.. Top Notch.. but it still a good song but it just dont fit.. the mood of the rest of the album.. other stand out cuts are Thinking of you .. Reminding you of Al Green's best workLet's Get Down.. Downright funky jam that should keep things bouncing ..Til Last Summer.. Great BalladStill a manHolly Smokes& Geewiz Wildchild
4,Personal sonnet sequence from a forgotten American original,"William Ellery Leonard was a professor of English at the University of Wisconsin for forty years. He translated Beowulf and several Greek authors. He published several volumes of poetry and also wrote plays and essays. He was politically active in the progressive movement and involved with Native American affairs including the preservation of effigy mounds around Madison. This sequence of sonnets called ""Two Lives"" concerns the death of his first wife, a suicide, and the social and personal ramifications of this tragic event. Written in somewhat archaic language the poems provide an insight into the interesting figure's early life. He also wrote an autobiography called ""The Locomotive God"" which deals with his early life."
1,Cookie Shortbread crumbs,"I also received the shortbread swirls in a crumbled state. The almond ginger cookies arrived fine in the same box and are excelllent. I didn't realize food products could not be returned until I just tried to return them.I wouldn't mind if these were simply broken, but they are crumbs. Pretty expensive bird food! Pamela's are the best Gluten Free cookies I have found, but I guess it is better to buy them at the grocery store for a higher price, than feed a whole case to the birds.I rate the cookies 5 but shipment of them 1."
5,PAMELA'S PRODUCTS SHORTBREAD SWIRL COOKIES ...,"THESE COOKIES ARE DELICIOUS. I LIKE THE CRUNCHINESS AND WONDERFUL FLAVOR OF THESE COOKIES. I HAVE ALSO TRIED THE LEMON SHORTBREAD. UM, DELIOUS, LEMONY FLAVOR. SINCE I HAVE CELIAC DISEASE AND ALLERGIC TO POTATO, CORN AND SOY, THESE COOKIES HELP SATISFY MY COOKIE CRAVING. I HAVE TO PREPARE MOST OF WHAT I EAT, SO WHEN I FIND A PRODUCT THAT I 'CAN' HAVE, I JUMP ON IT! I JUMPED ON THIS PRODUCT, LOVE IT, LOVE IT, LOVE IT. I FIND THAT WITH SO MANY ALLERGIES AND BEING ALLERGIC TO PRESEVATIVE AND ADDITIVES, AMAZON.COM SELLS SO MANY PRODUCTS THAT I CAN HAVE, SO THIS HELPS CUT DOWN ON MY NEED TO PREPARE EVERYTHING THAT I EAT. WHAT A BLESSING TO HAVE CHOICES NOW!"
5,Secret Gardens of England,"Birds chirping...water bubbling...English men and women calmly talking about their plans and plants... nonintrusive background music... Ahh! This DVD is just soooo soothing, especially when you are a Texan hiding out from the scorching drought. I sometimes bring it out just to see the water features..."
4,"Beautiful gardens, not enough Titch.","This DVD consists of two hour-long programs looking at some of the more out-of-the-way gardens open to the public in England. Alan Titchmarsh presents the program and takes us on a tour of gardens ranging from stately homes to small backyards.The gardens are exquisite and the photography is excellent. This program was made quite early in Titchmarsh's career and although he does a professional job as narrator, there isn't much of his trademark quirky humor and he hardly appears on camera.For lovers of gardens (which includes my wife and myself) this is a treat to watch. For those who like Alan Titchmarsh (which also includes my wife and myself) there isn't quite enough Titch."
2,"Was ist los, Ellen?..","This album is not a bad one for itself. However I know Ellen's work since the beginning, and I must admit that I was used to hear a much greater (and more personal) work since her last Berlinette album. Although not beeing bad, this new album seems to reflect a kind of regression (or hesitation?): first track ""Come"" is quite cool, announcing the Ellen's touch we know (and love!), but it doesn't last: the rest of the album is a kind of Loveparade-era revival (some will have recognized reworks of some legendary trance tunes) or, worst, some again-and-again Electroclash beats à la Felix da Housecat... Ellen, where are you gone??.. That's why I gave Thrills only two stars..."
3,The old receipe was much better,"These cookies were awesome until early spring 2009. As of right now they no longer have a fresh baked oven crispness which melts in your mouth and the espresso flavor is lacking. I keep trying out different box dates and unfortunately they are not like the original receipe. Being an ex-addict of these cookies right now, which might be a good thing, I'm so disappointed that they aren't like the original cookies. I'll keep watching the boxes to see if they have the old look again one day."
4,Clarks Vitara,"Possibly the most comfortable pair of shoes I have ever owned.They fit about 1 size smaller.I normally wear a 9 but needed a size 8 for this shoe.The one drawback is that the sole rubber is not the strongest,and they developed a crack after less than 1 year of use.This causes them to leak in wet weather.Hopefully in the latest Clarks model, they have used better quality rubber.Even with the poor soles, I would buy them again, as they fit like a glove and are very light.They do take a few days to break in, as the leather stretches.The one size smaller makes a big difference.If you buy your normal shoe size, you will find they are too big.Clarks has very good customer service, and replaced the cracked soled shoes with a new pair.This is an old model shoe, so is no longer manufactured by Clarks.The closest similar pair I could find was Escalade, or Medina."
4,Vibrant sounds of an explosive decade!,"T Rex was one of the few bands that really could survive in this hard transition between the music made until 1974 and the new sound of the emerging disco music. His arrangements always kept the essential of his style without abdicating expression. This selection spans the great hits between 1972 and 1977, and specially there are highlights as Celebrated summer, I love to Boogle, Metal Guru and Teenage Dream."
5,T.REX Greatest Hits 1972-77 A-Sides,"This CD is fabulous!!! I can not stop listening it. I recently watched the film the ""Velvet Goldmine"" and have been obsessed with ""Glam-rock"" ever since.I feel this CD is one of several classic examples of what ""GLAM"" is all about and should not be missed."
5,I even leave this sitting out when not in use!,"The beautiful clean lines make it such a beautiful way to serve coffee. Even after several hours the coffee was still steaming, but many carafes can do that - this one is gorgeous!"
5,OEM product for less money,"This is actually the OEM NipponDenso vac advancer, just packaged in a Standard Ignition products box. It's expensive, but worth it."
4,Pretty Good,"This is not my favorite Billy Whiskers book, but it is still fun. I guess the original is still the best. My dad used to read Billy Whiskers to us, and it was hilarious. Now it's just mildly amusing."
5,Gets the job done.,This detachable harp is brass and it holds my shade. That's why I bought it. To hold my lamp shade. It does that and that is about it. I'm happy.
4,Boys In 21st Century,"Crystal Boys has been written for a series of TV play recently in Taiwan. The TV series is now playing on Taiwan Public Television Station. Some of the scenes are different from original story written and I would say that it's quite a success. However, the story told by author Mr. Pai still touches me deeply after all these years since I first read the novel."
3,I have the Blurry out of focus issue too,"I decided to buy the Nikon coolpix 7900 because of its size and the ""guide"" feature which make taking picture idiot proof for everybodyAfter using it for a month, I am really disappointed with the picture quality.Initially, I thought the Nikon coolpix 7900 camera was defective, but after reading some of the review here, I realized that I am not the only person who is issue with it.8 out of 10 pictures that I took are out of focus. Don't get me wrong, it is not very burry, but when you view it 100%, it is very obvious.I agreed with the previous user who commented that the 7900 has poor auto focusing compared to MANY other cameras. I think Nikon seriously has to work on the focus.One thing I do like about the Nikon is the battery lifespan. It last a long time.Pardon me, I am not here to bash Nikon, just sharing my experience of owning the coolpix 7900 camera."
4,A slick package and easy to use.,"I had an earlier version of this camera and so bought this one to upgrade. I especially like the Scenes Mode. My favotite is Museum. We travel a lot and visit places that flash is not allowed. This mode is excellent.Another feature I like is being able to change scene modes with the rotary dial. I kinda wish the Museum mode was one of the selections. However, the selections are useful ones, easy to get to with the turn of a switch.I've have found the battery life to be good. I just recharged it yesterday after using it over a month around the house.I like to feel of it and the styling, especially the black case. It looks like a camera! The viewfinder was one of the reasons I bought the camera. There are times, in bright sun you cannot see an LCD screen.I give it 4 stars right now. I have yet to use it a lot, but so far I am satisfied."
4,Great camera,"I love this camera! I was most concerned about the picture quality, and it's fantastic! This camera is worth every penny!!!"
1,Failed to Work Right Out OF Box!!!!,This camera did not work after I charged and inserted the battery. This camera did nothing after I pressed the ON button. It just does not work!!!
5,Best point and shoot in class,"I have had nothing but great results with this camera. Make sure to read the manual and reviews to help you adjust for best picture quality. People have been complaining about the poor AF lamp again I've have great results, I'm not sure what is causing thier poor results. I compared this to the Canon SD500 which is also a great camera, I ultimatly like the pictures out of the Nikon better. The thing that sold me was no purple fringing around objects with the Nikon. I would encourage people to try both, the coolpix 5900 is a great 5MP version of this camera."
4,Love It,I just got this camera a couple of days ago. It takes wonderful pictures right out of the box. I am very happy with all the pictures I have taken with it. Very easy to use.
5,Soaking by Starlight,"To soak in a natural hot spring beneath a bazillion blazing stars is akin to stealing the creme filling outta the Oreos...and no one notices! Finding these special, out of the way places to soak -- off the beaten path -- is a triumph and a wonder. Thank you so much for fording the way into uncharted waters......"
5,unbelievably unjust,"If this horrible thing can happen to Catherine Meyer with little hope for resolution, think of how many others out there who are not as visible but are experiencing the same nightmare. The whole thing is tragic and wrong!"
2,Could be better,The quality is poor and the picture is very dark. It froze a couple of times but the movie itself is very funny
5,Nostalgic pleasure!,"I love Smile Orange! This movie always makes me laugh and takes me back to my adolescent days in late 70's Jamaica. The movie has a weak plot, farcical situations and cliche characters - but I still love it! Oscar-worthy it was not. But it's full of slapstick humor and belly-busting laughs! I give it 2 thumbs up just for the nostalgic element. Carl Bradshaw is always hilarious."
3,Good to add to your Jamaican entertainment collection,It was definitely a 70s movie. It was funny at times. Good to add to your Jamaican movie collection.
3,"A difficult transitional album, a child of it's times","By the early 90's most metal bands were in trouble, if they stayed the same they would become dinosaurs, if they changed too much they would lose their fan base. Some great bands got so lost they have been dead for me for the past 20 years, for example Queensryche and Metallica. The same happened to Deliverance, They wanted to stay afloat but in the process pretty much lost their identity. It sometimes sounds progressive, even a little of Fates Warning, sometimes it get bogged down to a halt almost like Metallica in Load. Then Jimmy stars singing in a very slow and low register that doesn't help at all. In short, problematic at best. But is not completely bad, i would say about half the tracks are ok, just not awesome. This is one for hard core fans, others better look for the previous 3 albums."
1,The steering stopped working after only 1 month of use on both bikes.,"The steering stopped working after one month. There is a one year warranty on the bike, so they will send a replacement. But they have been around for a while now. So are the parts just going to keep dying? Why haven't they fixed this problem yet? I bought two bikes, and both of the steerings died after one month.Besides this, the tension on the bike is very low. It is very easy to peddle on the hardest setting. It's too weak."
3,Labels galore,"The book is well-written, it is effective in presenting details of Nixon's early career, and it bends over backward to be fair toward him. It does not bend over backward to be fair to everyone else: Gellman finds it too easy to lump New Deal liberals with Socialists and Communists - making it seem the only difference that he sees between them is shades of pink. That makes it hard to accept his arguments about red-baiting - arguments that are important to Gellman's treatment of Nixon as an honorable, ethical lawmaker ... Still, this is a stimulating work and one that taught me a lot about one of America's most fascinating political characters."
2,Not as good as expected---Disappointing,"This account of Richard Nixon's early political years was more of a factual recitation of events during this period than any new revelations about Nixon, the man. In addition, the book included numerous syntax and spelling errors. Not a book to read if you have read other Nixon biographies (Ambrose, Wicker, etc.)"
1,complete cabinetmaker???,"I purchased this book since I lost my cabinet making book.I found this book to be a lot of talk, but little in the way of actual details, such as measurements, in cabinet making.I had the wood, glue and saw. I wanted a book that would give me actual details on making a cabinet. Instead, I got a lot of definitions and pictures.If you're ready to build a cabinet, go to your local library and find a book that gives you actual measurements and step by step instructions."
4,Useful book - thorough,"Considerable detail - too much to be a fun read. but the details seem to be there to make kitchen cabinets. i enjoyed Tolpin's Building Traditional Kitchen Cabinets more for edutainment value, but both are worthwhile additions to the library."
4,Like having a teacher there,"I wanted to build a contemporary European-style cabinet for my darkroom. I had never made a cabinet (or any furniture) before, but the author did such a good job anticipating my questions, etc., the whole project went really smoothly and I was pretty satisfied with the results. I appreciated how he provided lots of explanation and background along the way (e.g., why it is important to drill a large enough pilot hole, the strengths and weaknesses of various screw fasteners, etc.), as well as his willingness to share his honest opinion about various tools, materials, etc. I would have rated the book a full five stars if he (or the editors) had provided metric equivalences for the various measurements; contrary to author's derogatory remarks about the metric system being based on a ""silly premise,"" there are many of us in the world who appreciate and use the metric system every day of our lives, and it hardly seems necessary to neglect metric equivalences."
3,Too high level for go-to reference,"The author does a very good job explaining the decisions one encounters designing a set of cabinets but leaves out any real instructions on how to actually build them. The book is much too high level for someone creating their first cabinet and the drawings are not clear enough to base your own designs off of. There are several shop drawings in the book that the author references as standard but later says that he never uses those same dimensions when he builds. This is very confusing and the mix of dimensions across shop drawings makes it even harder to understand. There are no actual dimensions or cut lists for standard boxes which I thought would be included in a book of this type. This seems to be aimed at someone looking to start up a new cabinet shop, not for the novice cabinet builder."
2,Silly and depressing,"I found this movie to be odd and depressing. There was no redeeming message, no moral of the story, and no happy ending. The acting was pretty good, and there were some pretty funny parts of it. But, it just leaves you with a sour feeling at the end."
5,Very Good,A great love story. Well worth the time to watch. Wife and I enjoyed it very much. Worth the watch.
3,worth watching once,"I like watching these types of indie, low budget movies that have great acting. Some scenes were funny; the movie overall was impactful but subtle. Great acting by Steve Carrell as usual, Keira was alright."
4,"enjoyable, more than expected","not a typical Hollywood meh movie, it actually had a believable story line, actors had a decent chemistry, try it you might like it."
2,Great potential but failed,I had wanted to watch this movie since I first heard about it and finally did. Now I wish I hadn't. It was much better in my mind. It had everything going for it for a great movie. I always like seeing how people deal with their own demise and this was on a world scale. The plot just wasn't there. It kept jumping from cameo to cameo and the characters made horrible decisions. By the end of this movie I was rooting for the asteroid. Do yourself a favor and don't watch this and go read The last policeman. Much better story dealing with the same premise.
3,NOT a comedy.,"While the movie was great, we rented it simply because it was in the ""Comedy"" genre and we wanted something lighthearted to watch. It is NOT a comedy, it is a tragic drama. A good movie, but not what we were expecting at all."
4,Entertaining and thought provoking,"More of a drama than a comedy. If I was Russian, this movie would be hitting a little too close to home (no pun intended)!"
5,Great product! Really happy,So far so good. It shuts off automatically after idling which I like. The screen is very good and I am extremely happy with this product
2,Not sure.,"Don't remember anything about the movie. Not a one I can recall any scene or line. There are some funny lines, but not anything I'd use at work."
1,Is This Movie in Slow Motion?,This is one of those movies that should be funny but never is. Its tough to recall a single joke from the film and be sure that I never laughed.The plot jumps to lots of seemingly needless venues. The pairing of the two main characters is weak.I hate picking up a film titled comedy and at the end you just want to kill yourself. This movie is overly dark for no reason.Watch the movie at high speed and maybe it'll get funnier.
3,OK for a Friday Night Rental,Not particularly well done and boring at times. Keira Knightley is wasted in her role and Steve Carell is well Steve Carell which means he plays a variation of the same character as in every movie he has been in. Connie Britton does a good job in a brief appearance but she wisely and quickly bolted from this melodramatic and meandering movie. [SPOILER ALERT]: The lackadaisical approach to the direction and script is perfectly captured in the scene where Steve Carell's character's father takes off from the U.S. in a single engine (small) plane for the U.K. with Keira Knightley's character (I can understand their desperation).
3,"Interesting, charming even, but it never quite takes off","As a casual aficionado of apocalyptic movies, I think this movie almost succeeds. The performances are very good, the script is smart, but it never quite comes together in the way I think the director/writer intended. There's just something about the tone of the film that seems off. It bounces around between many doomsday-themed films and can't quite decide if it's black comedy, rom-com, or wacky road trip. You might say there's nothing wrong with trying to be all of these, but it only seems to dilute the impact of the central story. While there are many movies about doomed lovers, the fact that nothing they do can redeem any part of the world around them makes this a somewhat frustrating watch."
5,Fun Movie,"Cute for someone with an adventurous spirit. A dark cute, but a cute one. Good for if you feel like watching a Semi-indie film. =)"
3,It's Okay,Decent story that doesn't sell out in the end. It was all too easy for the characters to get together though. I didn't buy the relationship between the two main characters.
5,"Thought-provoking, endearing movie","First of all, let me say at the outset, if you're looking for a comedy, this ain't it. There are a few funny moments in the film, to be sure, but there are many more thoughtful, poignant, even shocking moments. The main point of the movie is to ask yourself: What gives life meaning? If I knew I was going to die tomorrow, how would I want to spend my last day? This is a *serious* take on that question. It's well-written and nicely acted. Whether or not there's a ""Hollywood ending"" at the end of the movie is somewhat debatable. I wouldn't say the writer completely chickens out at the end, but in some ways, some might argue the ending was predictable. It was still a great ending, though. :)In case you're wondering why I don't go through the plot, it's because I don't want to give anything away. You need to see it! :)"
2,Wish I could say I liked this movie,"I really wanted to like this movie. I like Steve Carell and Kiera Knightley and I thought it was going to be a romantic comedy.Dodge (Steve Carell) has been living a mundane life until an asteroid is predicted to destroy the earth in two weeks. In the first scene, his wife leaves him because their marriage wasn't working anyway. He goes to work because he doesn't know what else to do.Some people are trying to get in everything they ever wanted to do during their lifetime while others are committing suicide. His friends are having End-of-the-World parties and want to hook him up with someone to spend his last days with.When rioting begins, Dodge and a neighbor he's just met leave the city and begin a road trip. He wants to find his high school love. Penny's (Kiera Knightley)family is in England so she goes along since she has no one else.Over all there wasn't much humor, but there was romance which was nice. Still the movie can only be described as a downer."
1,Worst Steve Carell Movie to Date,"On the surface the premise sounds interesting and possibly funny. However, the movie is neither. It limps along disjointedly with very little humor and even less use the ""End of the World"" premise. We rented it because we usually find Steve Carell to be enteraining - not in this case. Don't waste your time."
1,"It's no ""Date Night""","I love Steve Carell, which is why we rented this movie. We expected a comedy (and for some reason, some reviewers refer to this as a comedy), but I didn't find it comedic in the least bit. It was very slow moving, dull, depressing, and after about 50 minutes, I couldn't take it anymore and we turned it off. I honestly don't know how some reviewers found things to laugh at in the movie. If you're looking for a comedy like ""Date Night"" or a movie that makes you truly laugh, you'll be severely disappointed. If you're looking for a dry film that critics love and that gets nominated for awards, perhaps you'll like it."
1,Terrible.,Very dark and not funny at all. The movie was predictable. Chemistry between Steve carrell and keira Knightly was non existent.
3,It's okay,"Not the greatest of Steve carrell's movies, but it was mildly entertaining. And Keira knightly wasn't nearly as annoying as she usually is, so that's a plus."
3,It's pretty good.,"It's also pretty funny and poignant. Not amazing though. If you think you want to see it, you should rent it. I enjoyed it."
3,Good comedy,"This was full of great actors but just ok as a movie. Funny, interesting, a little unrealistic. It is something to watch once only."
4,Worth the time,This was a good movie that starts out a little slow then builds into something very moving. The acting is top rate and the movie is paced well. Not a movie for happy ending fans but not too intense at the end.
2,Didn't hold your attention,Kind of dragged on. Always have high hopes for a steve Carel movie and this didn't reach them. Kept waiting for movie to go somewhere
2,boring,"very boring movie, lot of talking not enough action. it isnt funny at all. it more of a love movie than a commedy"
1,Avoid. You will thank me.,"This is just a bad script directed by a director who probably should never be given another chance to direct a film. Horrid. Steve Carell's portrayal of his character was listless. For someone who can be so funny I was surprised that he played his character in such a bland way that, as a viewer, I couldn't form any opinion or emotion about him other than boredom.Poor Keira Knightley. She was actually quite good, the only good part of the film. I felt sorry for her having part of her legacy attached to this misadventure.I was also peeved that the trailer suggests that the film is laced with humor. Extremely misleading. Nothing could be further from the truth."
1,Stinks!,"Half way through I turned movie off in disgust.The world is ending and in this movie people have random sex with everyone.No one seeking the GOD of the universe for help or answers. No hope, only debauchery.Too bad.Waste of time."
2,PLEASE DONT WASTE YOUR TIME,"THE MOVIE HAS ITS HIGH POINTS AND ITS FUNNY POINTS, BUT ITS ULTIMATELY A CHEESY LOVE STORY. I WOULD ADVISE YOU TO SPEND YOUR 3.99 ON SOMETHING ELSE, I WAS NOT EXPECTING THE GREATEST MOVIE IN THE WORLD, BUT THE STORY FOR THIS MOVIE IS JUST TERRIBLE."
1,Most depressing movie ever,This is definitely not a comedy.Don't be fooled by the actors who star in it- you'll wish you had those two hours back.
3,"Sad Movie, Finding you are human at the end of life.",Everything that happens to this guy is pure luck? Running from life the entire movie. You cannot fly to Europe in a little one engine plane.
2,Really not funny,"It was really not that funny. I have like everything Steve Carrell does, but this was so bad. I wish I had not rented it."
2,Don't bother,"I thought I would love it, but was bored. I was hoping for a wonderful teary final, but everybody just died. Period. Don't bother."
2,"Seeking a better written, better directed, better acted movie","Not a comedy, not a love story, not a drama, not worth watching. Sorry I wasted an hour and a half my remaining time on this earth on this."
3,Anticlimactic,I am a fan of both the actors. I was let down by the lack of chemistry and a poor script. It was predictable and poorly made.
2,just ok,Its not great. It was very predictable. Not very funny. Wasnt very entertaining and didnt hold my attention. It was hard to finish watching.
3,"good, slow, sad","Overall, I thought the movie and acting were good. It was slower than expected and quite sad, but still worth watching."
3,Pretty good,this was a good movie as far as sappy romance movies go. It's a chick-flick so be warned. Not too crazy about the ending though
3,Funny or Sad?,This movie doesn't seem to know what it wants to be. Steve Carrell is funny but the movie is tragic.
4,Good Movie!,"I liked this movie quite a bit! It was amusing, and serious, and I thought it was well paced. The actors all did a wonderful job."
4,very moving story,Well done and very moving account of feeling about a subject that has crossed our minds.Enjoyed the acting and the drama of the entire movie.
2,Not worth the time.,"If this movie was any slower, it would have been running in reverse!The story started coming together in the last five minutes and then ended.Watch only if you are terribly bored!"
4,Nice movie,"Show a different view of a apocalyptic movie, and what the people due on these circumstances.la la la la"
1,Seeking a Refund at the End of This Movie,"The premise had promise, the actors have talent, and the critics were upbeat. But boy, did this movie fall flat on its face. It's not a drama, because there was never any. It's not a comedy, because nothing funny ever happened. It was just a boring waste of a couple of hours of your time and the talents of some very good actors. Mostly, I blame the story. It was a meandering trail to nowhere, full of implausible twists, unnecessary holes, and side plots that lead to dead ends. Unlike many other Steve Carrell vehicles, it was not particularly charming or quirky, and it lacked the depth and realism that lends other similar movies a likable quality. The only possible explanation I can come up with is that the filmmaker is trying to use her medium to make a point about the human condition: that our time on earth has been a useless, pointless, poorly-contrived waste of time. You know, just like her movie."
2,I expected better,"This is what happens when Steve Carell tries to do smart comedy. It plays very flat, plot was boring. Keira Knightly came off as a twit."
2,I love a good end of the world movie...,"Unfortunately, this is a bad end of the world movie. It fails to offer any insight in exchange for apocalypse. I've had more meaningful adventures inspired by a late-night hankering for Chinese food."
5,Better then what I expected,This is a really thought provoking movie. I knew nothing about the plot. We were just looking for something to watch. It's worth watching. A pleasent surprise.
1,Painful....,"If I could give no stars or less I would for this movie. DON'T be fooled by the trailer or characters. This movie is AWFUL!! I just lost 75 min of my life that I will never be able to use. I feel that I should get some reward for enduring this torture. This movie could have been 30 minutes less and it might have had a chance. The first 30 minutes are good, but you can shut it off after that. Go for a walk or something. You'll be glad you did.But seriously, don't watch it."
1,Awful,How is it 4 stars with 52 reviews?? This was not good. Incredibly cheesy and not great acting. Waste of $$.
2,Depressing,I thought the whole premese of the movie was depressing. Knowing that the world was ending in less than two weeks gave me anxiety while watching it. Just didn't like it.
1,Terrrible Movie,"Terrible movie turned it off after only about 10 minutes, would not recommend this movie. I rate this zero stars i would give it a minus if it would let me. The rating about i had to put one star, but it is not."
2,Neither funny nor heart-warming,"I expected a movie with this star (and described as a comedy) to actually be funny. I think there was one spot (now forgotten) in which I chuckled, but I kept waiting for something worthwhile to happen, and it never did. Not a good use of the time."
1,Not funny at all,"Lame movie, wasn't funny. We didn't thinkthis movie was very funny at all. It didn't seem to have much plot either"
2,Not Much,Did not like It. A good plot but boring in some areas with a bad ending. Not worth the money.
4,Good movie,"Very funny but sad. this movie makes you laugh and is well done but the end just will make you cry, taking away all the funny out of the room. but still a good movie."
2,eh,had a lot of potential but was not very good unfortunately. the trailer was very good but the movie didn't live up to it
4,A fun movie,I Love Steve Carell no matter what he does. Thought this movie handled the end of the world quite nicely!
2,Movie didn't work on Kindle,"The movie wouldn't load on kindle fire, so I never got to see the movie. Waste of about four dollars."
2,Disappointing,"I expected better from Steve, this was sorely disappointing. Avoid this movie and watch one of his better ones pronto!"
5,Most under rated film I have seen all year.,"So I saw Cloud Atlas-which will be a review on its own later-and it did not live up to expectations. I rented this movie today, and I would watch it again. It is emotional and it does have a semi sad ending. The acting though...it is just so beautiful. The chemistry between Knightley and Carell is effortless and believable. This movie really puts into perspective, the things that are important to us, and makes us question our time and relationships. Recommended."
1,Depressing,This is a slow depressing movie. Steve Carell and Keira Knightley don't work well toghther. I kept hoping it would pick up but it never did.
2,"Slogged at first, then somewhat redeemed","Very hard to get through the first 45 minutes or so. In the middle, I had hope for a cohesive story. By the end, I was inexplicabley touched by the main characters. Pretty certain the whole thing was written by a clinical depressive with a nihilist outlook.Personally, the only time I can recommend a movie this depressing and hopeless (and really, not funny), is when it informs or encourages the kind of reflection that may lead to change (i.e., Schindler's List)."
3,"Good movie, wrong genre","This movie is a good movie if you go into it expecting a love story/drama. If you are at all expecting a comedy you will be greatly disappointed (as I was). No funny scenes, no twists, no one liners...just a drama starring a comedian. As I said, it is a good love story, it is a light hearted drama...and so it is a good movie, if that is the genre you are looking for."
5,Love a disaster movie,"Do not expect a happy ending. But with that in mind, it is a fun watch, and I cried. A few red herring plot items, but oh well. I love these actors. The point behind the movie is good. I know some will give fewer stars, but for some reason this touched my heart."
2,Searching for a plot,"I was looking for a lighthearted, above average rom com. In Seeking a Friend the basic plot (the world is ending in 3 weeks, let's do the things we never got around to) should be fairly easy to build into a good story. Instead, there are completely illogical, poorly contrived plot angles that are poorly acted. The poor story and dialogue and unconvincing nature of these plot angles were so extreme that I couldn't not ignore them. They were too bad, even for a film for which my expectations are not high."
3,For the Dark Humor/Romance Fan,"Very depressing and anti-climactic. If you are looking for the typical Steve Carell movie, expect a few laughs, but I regret paying money to view this early."
4,Good,"I liked this movie, yet can see why it wasn't a commercial success. It's depressing thinking about the day to day reality of END TIMES. But Carrell's performance was so genuine; the script was so well written and the end so REAL that it's well worth spending time with this film."
2,Didn't like.,The trailers held the most interesting parts of the movie.Just weak. Some parts were funny like the restaurant scene and the party - Drugs anyone?
2,Girl friend walked out,I enjoy all movies this one was just ok. Not much to say about this attempt I like the ending :)
5,"Fan of SC. My expectations of this movie was low but in the other hand, it was a very moving story.","My expectations were low on renting this movie, but as I was done watching it, it left me thinking. You don't know when and where you find love and how much time you have. This movie disgregards all those questions, you find love anywhere and it doesn't matter how much time you have with each other, as long as you don't take each other for granted. The plot of the movie was great and the conclusion was unexpected. I thought the movie might turn into a sci-fi type of movie but it turned out to be a bit of romance. This is a MUST-SEE!"
4,Good movie,It started out slow but ended up good. Kind of makes you think what it could be like here someday.
3,interesting movie,"I gave this three stars because it wasn't overly fantastic, however, it was interesting and entertaining. I liked the story line...what would you do if you knew the world was going to end soon? I would definitely see it. It's funny and dark humor at times, but the world is ending....so, what would you expect?!"
2,Disappointing to the extreme,Someone must have gotten a big payday to do this snoozer. My wife couldn't even finish watching it while I kept waiting for something to happen that was interesting to sneak up. Didn't make it to the end.
2,"Talented ensemble in sappy, boring movie with irritating sound track","I settled in to what I assumed -considering the actors - would be a clever, imaginative, funny movie about the impending apocalypse. And it was, in small vignettes and occasional lines. But there were boring and sappy ones in equal measure. We had to keep getting up to turn down the music - especially during closing histrionics - but I guess that's a matter of taste. I wish we'd seen more of the dog, who had the best role. As I said to my friend (sought out for an end of the day movie), ""Hey, I'm really sorry about that one..."""
3,The old bait and switch!,"This isn't a comedy - the trailer is really misleading. And it's kind of like two separate movies were stitched together. The first half was a silly road trip flick, and the second half was a sad love story. It was pretty good, but I wasn't really in the mood for a tearjerker regret-fest. I don't know why they didn't market this movie based on its actual plot. That tactic really undermined Steve Carrell's performance."
3,This One is Just OK,"There is nothing horribly bad, but it finds its place right in the middle of the road. It doesn't pack an entertainment punch, or a major spark. I would consider it mildly satisfying if I were in a waiting room situation and had already browsed all of the available magazines."
2,"Had a promising premise, but ultimately unfunny","The trailer for this movie made it look rather interesting, and potentially pretty funny. For the most part, most of what was interesting or funny in the movie can be experienced by merely watching the trailer.Steve Carrell comes across as extremely creepy, as he does in most movies when he's not being overtly funny.Plot holes galore. Truthfully I looked my wife in the eyes after this one and said, ""it's bad when i'm regretting that i didn't let you rent magic mike instead."""
4,Check it out.,Better than I expected. Not nearly as down and depressing as the log-line would have you believe. And Knightly would be a great person to be with when the world ends.
1,Hated it,"Total yawn, nothing happens in this movie that wasn't obviously going to within the first five minutes. Steve Carell should have stuck wih The Office and should stop making terrible movies."
2,Seeking a better version of this movie,"This movie has a lot of moments where it left me asking ""what the...?"" due to gaps in the story line. The ending was predictable and I just found myself wanting more from the movie. There some underutilized actors in this movie which added to the frustration from watching this movie."
3,So so....,"Not too bad. There were some very funny parts but, overall, pretty slow. Interesting story line though. I would recommend it...."
1,BOOORRRRRRIIINNG,"What a horribly boring movie, and huge let down! Now I know why I don't care for Steve Carell, and I thought I'd give him the benefit of the doubt!"
1,Seeking a Better Movie,This was maybe the worst movie I have ever seen. I like Steve Corell but he could never save a movie this poorly constructed. Many others in the cast are often good in other movies but not this one!
1,Don't waste the time or the couple of dollars!,"Title was nothing about friendship, unless you are interested in sex, death, and meaningless dialog. Don't waste your time with this flick."
4,"Nice blend of romantic, funny, and interesting.",It wasn't incredible but it was well worth watching. Why does it require that I have a minimum number of words I my review?
3,Can't Say I am a Fan,"It was alright. Not really a Steve Carell fan so I may be the wrong review to read if you are a fan.I do like Keira Knightly so I saw this. Are a few parts that I didn't want my kids seeing (namely my 12 year old) because it was a bit too risque but the humor was okay in parts. Unreal though, did not like the ending. Should have expected that."
2,Bland and Boring,"Who would spend their last days on earth in dull conversation about the stupid details of their lives? I expected so much more from this movie. I stuck through it by sheer optimism, hoping it would turn around, but Rob Corddry's three or four lines in the first scenes were as good as it got. I have sworn myself off popular indie films and Steve Carell for at least a year."
2,Not as advertised,"I only rented this because so many reviews said it was funny. My husband and I had maybe to moments where we kind of laughed. Other than that, this is a very serious movie and very depressing."
3,Couldn't even finish it,"We could not even get though the movie, the lulls are frequent and the humor sparse. I love Steve Carrell and Keira knightley and was excited to see them both, until about 30 minutes in when we realized we weren't laughing. We stopped at the the last 20 minutes and haven't looked back since"
5,Great little romantic comedy,This was an interesting movie to watch which had some serriouslt strange takes on how people mighr act during the end of the world. Notably people were still going to work and the chaos didnt begin soon enough for my thoughts on the human race. However this is just a movie and it played out at top level
3,Not crazy about it.,"Love both actors, sweet story, but if you watched the trailer you got most of what there is in this movie. Ending was, well, predictable, but that's kinda what the movie is about I guess."
5,Great romance comedy,This is one of the best romance/comedies that I have seen in a while. Right up there with Wristcutters: A Love Story.
2,Boring,Unrealistic love affair :-/ Did not believe any of it. Fake movie. I prefer Steven in comedic roles. He creeped me out here.
3,enjoyable but not really a comedy,"This movie was billed as a comedy, but although the premise could be humorous, I find it difficult to describe this movie as a comedy. It fits more into the category of ""chick-flick"". Don't get me wrong; we enjoyed watching it, but it wasn't really a comedy. It's more of a feel-good story about two odd characters who find each other while navigating through a bizarre situation (the end of the world), following a story line that is convoluted as a consequence of that situation. Good but not great. It helps if you like the main actors."
4,Depressing,Very depressing to watch but the acting was good in it. I wish the ending would have been much different as well.
2,Half baked,"This movie could not figure out whether it wanted to be a comedy or a romance. By trying to be a romantic comedy, something was lost in the middle. Light on laughs and too heavy on the emotional angles"
2,No chemistry,I like Steve Carell and Knightly is okay. But they have no chemistry together. The best part of the movie? The trailer.
3,okay,"Movie was okay. Would recommend watching it, but don't have too high of expectations. Steve Carrell plays the same kind of loner role that he plays in most movies and does so admirably"
3,"Decaffeinated ""Last Night""","First of all, this is a mediocre Hollywood remake of a 1999 Canadian film called ""Last Night"". The Canadian film was a wonderful lyrical story about the emptiness of life. What do you do when life has no meaning and the world is about end? The film catalogued the human strategies of coping with this. One guy tried to sleep with all women in town, another was trying to be by himself, etc. It was interesting and entertaining though melancholic. It had actors we do not normally see and therefore refreshing. This new film hasn't the charm of the old film. On top of it, Steve Carell and Keira Knightley do not work well together. Keira overplays terribly and Steve is a miscast. I do not recommend it. Watch ""Last Night"" instead."
4,quirky & funny,A quirky and funny movie that is sure to make you laugh and think about the meaning of life. Good stuff!
3,Sends a nice message,"If you're thinking this movie is a comedy- you're wrong. There are certainly funny moments but the overall theme centers on love and family; the style sort of reminded me of ""Dan in Real Life"". It's a cute movie with a nice message and a not so great ending."
4,Sweet way to end the world,"We decided to watch the movie on Dec 21, since the world was supposed to come to an end today anyway, per the Mayan calendar. The movie was not what we expected. We missed the part of the description that said drama and romance. When we saw that it was Steve Carrell, we figured it would be quirky, and it was. We thought it would be more comedic than it was. While parts of the movie were a bit slow and predictable, the saving grace was the end of the movie -- it was one of the sweetest endings I've seen in a long time. I would watch the end of the movie again, just to hear some of the last lines. So, did our world end today? Not so far, but it's only 10:53pm. Was this a good way to spend a couple hours, in case the world does still end tonight? I think so."
3,"Cute, but depressing","There is no hope in this movie. I normally love Steve Carill movies, because he is so cute, and he is cute in this as well, but it leaves you kinda sad...."
2,Just So-So Movie,"Good beginning, nice ending but an awful middle of the picture. Not worth wasting time to watch it. I should have known that anything with Steve Carell in could not be any good."
4,What would you do if the end of the world were coming?,"Steve Carrell and Keira Knightly play characters who meet by chance as the world is falling apart anticipating the arrival of a large asteroid that will destroy the world. Funny at times, ironic, sad. Perhaps it could really happen like this. Highly recommended, well done roles by Steve and Keira."
3,Below Average Movie,I hadn't read anything about this before we rented it. After viewing it I could see why. Steve Carrell's considerable skills were wasted on this weak and unbelievable concept. It had a few moments but you can see no why no awards or accolades.
3,"Okay, not great","Okay movie, but some things were not necessary or unexplained like how the girl hooked up with several black soldiers and why they had little cars sitting out in a side yard. She was supposed to fly to England to see her parents and they took off in an old Piper single engine that wouldn't have made it 200 miles out. Odd things in the movie made you stop and think why it was done that way."
5,Charming and Heartfelt,Not your typical or romance or for that matter your usual end of the world flick. Well worth the watch as you will love these characters.
2,Painful to watch,"This movie is bad. When it was over, my husband literally yelled out Bad! Twice.First, the casting was horrible and set the movie up to fail. Carrell is 50, Knightly is 27...watching them together was completely unbelievable. No chemistry at all. On top of that, the acting was too much to swallow and we never believed the characters. The whole time it just felt off.I read the bad reviews and thought that maybe we'd see something in it that others didn't, but no...this movie earned the bad reviews.If you insist on watching it anyway like we did, get it from the library but I wouldn't waste money on it. You'll already likely feel you wasted your time on it when it's over."
1,Not a comedy and not really a drama,"Sort of like a first walk through of a movie idea that someone now needs to go write, take out some scenes and make work."
1,"Title should have been: ""Seeking a Reason for Making This Movie""","Do you feel you don’t have enough depression in your life?Well…..this movie will get you plenty depressed.There is no reason I can think of (in my opinion) to make just a movie.Nothing, in the end come out good. Steve Carell’s character drags down the movie with a life so sad that when he finally meets someone to love, it's taken away by the end of the world. Yes...the world really does come to an end.It’s sad from beginning to end.Please! Do not watch this movie."
2,Slow and Barely Meaningful,"If you want to slow it down and enjoy a pensive, slow-moving, almost depressing plot that tries to impart quirky life lessons then this is a good movie for you. Do not expect any real comedy."
3,Thumbs up,This was a good movie but it started to quickly an they should have showed the long lost love he was looking for an I thought they should have showed the asteroid an I thought the riot was dumb cuz y would u riot when the world is coming to its end what's the point other that it was worth watching.
1,Sadly disappointing.,"I thought Steve Carell would lead the movie towards the funny side, and Keira Knightley would keep it centered and interesting, making a good pair. I was sadly disappointed! They have no chemistry, the movie ends terribly and it was slow and depressing.As much as I care for these two actors, I would advise you to save your money and don't buy it, I did, let me be the one with the bad choice."
1,Love Steve Carell hated this movie,"This movie did not flow at all. The beginning was horribly contrived with the end of the world stuff, and Dodge (who names they're kid that) as an insurance sales man hating his life and job. It got a little better as it got into the journey phase, but still clunky. The end was ok."
3,Another Depressing Steve Carell Movie,"While this movie had a few funny moments and made you think a little, it was over all sort of depressing. =/"
3,Seeking a Friend for the End.....,"This movie was not what I expected it to be. The story line was odd, it had a few funny moments, but bottom line, just odd and sad. These two actors can do so much better. Odd movie."
4,Good movie,A cute movie. It was funny and had a good message. A bit sad at the end. I would recommend it.
2,Started Out Funny but Got Pretty Dull,"I thought that the premise of this movie sounded interesting so I gave it a try. I was watching it with a friend and we both were enjoying it at the beginning. It was funny and thought provoking. However, towards the end it got very boring a drawn out. I was kind of disappointed with this movie."
2,Not so good,"A depressing movie, considering it was supposed to be a comedy. Acting was good, but overall very dark and depressing."
3,not he best,This movie just dragged on was waiting and waiting for something to happen. Then even the ending was crappy too..
4,it was ok,Not a super production not so bad either just meh. I just don't understand why precisely in 2012 so passe
4,Good romantic and sarcastic comedy,The movie pictures good catches about what people would do if end of world is announced but they do in a sarcastic way.In parallel to those events you will see the adventures of two characters that go through those events seeking for a person.I won't tell the whole story because you need to watch to see if you like. I though an interesting movie for all the variety of reaction even the main characters in the movie.
1,Disappointed,I am a very big Steve Carell fan. This movie was depressing and disappointing. Don't waste your time or money.
2,Boring,"If you are suffering from insomnia. RENT THIS MOVIE. Good story line but, no excitement, some funny parts and a cute dog. Steve Carrell was lack-luster at best and Kira Knightly made more weird faces than good acting."
1,Dissapointing,"Interesting plot, but the movie just never got going. Dissappointing, not even a good ""chick flick"". So many opportunities for comedy that never were exploited. Another example of the studios putting two known actors in an movie and expecting the public to see the movie, even though there is no substance. Absolute waste of time."
1,disappointing,"Kept waiting for the good part and it never came. Chemistry between the two main characters just wasn't there. You would think that for a movie with such a novel premise, the writers could have come up with better subplots or scenarios exploring what could happen at the end of the world. But no. The plot was light, silly, and in no way compelling. Expected so much from a Steve Carrell vehicle."
1,Depressing and no point,"Terrible story lineSteve carrel and kiera knightly? uhhhh, ok. Just a terrible movie and not worth it. Not very funny as previews suggest and just plain dull."
3,I hope the world doesn't end this way,"I like both Steve Carrell and Keira Knightley. They both can be funny, but I didn't think this movie was very funny. I liked the scene at ""Welcome to Friendlys"", but otherwise this movie was very average. They can do better and so can you."
2,Meh!,What could have been a smart black comedy turns into an attempt to prove that Steve Carell can do misty-eyed melodrama. He can't. This movie actually turns the end of the world boring.
2,fair to middling,"kinda ok at times, not worth it overall. Just kinda ""meh"". Not funny enough, didn't really care what happened to the characters."
2,Not one of his best.,"I'm a big Steve Carell fan. Loved him in the Office, Dan in Real Life, but this not so much. Didn't connect to the character, wasn't very funny and I thought that Keira Knightley was just bad. Not worth the time."
4,Thought Provoking & Entertaining,"Makes you contemplate just what your priorities would be in such a situation,I think we'd be doing what the surfers and cyclists up to. Keep an eye out for them. They were the ones with a smile on their faces still. Nice touch."
2,Not what I expected,I was disappointed. Expected a little more comedy with Steve Carrell being the star in this movie. Won't watch again.
4,More of a drama than a comedy,"This was an enjoyable movie, but go into it knowing that it is not as comedic as the trailer might suggest. But, good performances by the main characters, and, as long as you know you're not going to come out feeling especially jolly, a rather enjoyable movie."
5,the anti prepper movie,"Great, you have to love Steve carell hes so akward and so amazingly human. I dont always like over the top comedies, but this was spot on. Although I will admit to trying to search for alternative ending. I wanted sorry to stay with the preppers and have a chance."
3,Your typical Cute end of the world romantic comedy,"Seen one seen them all. Carel's character is his typical, nice guy. It's funny in places, mostly just cute. I would watch again"
4,It is clever and funny!,"The end of the world in 3 weeks and people are going crazy. Dodge's wife leaves him and he finds a friend Penny to share the end of the world. Its a really sweet,quirky funny and clever movie."
3,Date night movie,Language was a little rough in spots. I think people who use foul language have a very small vocabulary and a poor grasp of the english language.
5,Seeking a Friend for the End of the World,"Great movie. I loved it. Big Steve Carell fan and who doesn't love Kira Knightly? I watched it before Dec. 21, 2012 and also found MY friend for the end of the world and now...beyond. A dark comedy dealing with how people handle different crisis and the CRAZY things they do!"
4,It's the end of the world as we know it and I feel fine,Some very funny moments and a movie that made me think about it for days afterwards. Good date night flick.
3,A good film -- well-acted -- but a bit depressing,"With the Mayan prediction that the world would end on December 21, 2012, some filmmakers jumped on the bandwagon to make the ""end of the world"" as a plot point. Most were horrible films, but this little film really affected me. I was a little shaken by the end of the film, but the more I thought about it and realized that this film did make an impression on me, the more I realized that this is a good, solid film. Just because movies don't go in a direction you would expect or want or like, doesn't mean their bad movies. I thought this film did a wonderful job at mixing the dark comedy with the true drama of an upsetting situation; plus, the soundtrack is awesome! Steve Carell has good chemistry with Keira Knightley (an actress with whom I don't usually like) and I was surprised at all of the actors who appeared in this. A heavy film but worth the viewing!"
3,That's It?,"This is kind of a cute story but kind of lame, too. Steve Carrell is always funny. With the end of the world coming, two people find each other in round about way... Like in the last few moments of earth... And then thew world ends. And I was left feeling like... ""That's It? That's the end?"""
3,"Good premise, poor execution","The idea is interesting, but the chemistry between the two characters is just not there. Steve Carell is not a strong dramatic actor although I though Kiera did a pretty good job. The end felt rushed."
1,"Slow, uneventful and forgettable","I felt like I was sitting through the end of the world while watching this movie. Too slow, forgettable characters and uninspired acting."
3,"""A Dark Romantic Comedy""","A very disappointing film considering that only 5 percent deals with the ""End of the world"" thread, while the remaining 95 percent is consumed by an overly wordy, dark romantic comedy between two people who demonstrate very little in the way of personal chemistry. SPOILER ALERT: The ending is exactly the same as that shown in the recent film, ""4:44 Last Day on Earth."""
1,Waste of Time and Money.,"This film was so bad that I never made it to the end. The writing was so nauseating, even though I knew coming into it that it was comedy/satire, I winced and rolled my eyes too many times to count. The writer director took two of my favorite actors and turned them into total dunces. No one says the things this woman writes. Keira Knightly was directed to be yet ANOTHER version of Natalie Portman's Garden State character, you know, quirky/lovable-even-though-she-doesn't feel lovable...uggg, giant fart noise...that character was annoying and so was this one. Steve Carell's talent was squandered and the failed attempt to set the film on the east coast might have been the most distracting element of all...she had them bury a man's body in the bakersfield hills for god's sake...I only pray that these 2 talented actors were well compensated and that this writer/director never gets a shot at making another screen play again.Do not waste your money."
1,this is not worth it,"Don't borrow with this sad little movie, it's depressing! I'm not sure why this movie was made, spoiler alert - they all die."
1,Not funny,"Just not my sense of humor! Felt it wasn't very funny at all, and thought the story line sort of dragged."
1,If there were less than a star This would get it.,"Although I really enjoy both actors , this one didn't do it. Like trying to start a car in the middle of an ice storm filled with honey. Just wouldn't crank it up"
1,Didn't like it . . . AT ALL!!,"Missed the comedy, if there was any. Acting marginal. Plot silly. Need I say more! Ranks up there with the all time worst movies!"
2,Not very good.,"Watchable....albeit, barely. Surprising for them both to star and it not be better. The trailer had all the funny scenes."
3,Okay. Not great,Steve Carell is a funny actor. This role was too dramatic for him and the movie wasn't funny enough for his talent.
2,Disappointed,"Even with the excellent cast, this movie is a flop. Sorry I bought it as a gift for my daughter."
4,Interesting Movie,"Not a huge Steve Carell fan, but this was a fun little movie. Make sure to pay attention to the TV in the background, some of the stuff they say and do is pretty funny. It was a enjoyable date movie."
3,Okay Film,"Not something I would go out of my way to see, but for a slow weekend night or if you're bored, it's okay."
2,Not a comedy,Slow moving with very few laughs. The music is the only thing that kept it from being a complete failure.
4,Meaningful,"There was a moral to this story. The most important thing about being alive is not necessarily staying alive. It was sad that the characters did not find meaningful relationships until there was no time left to enjoy them, but meaninful that at least they found them."
1,Off to the turtle races,"My wife and I can't believe that we watch to whole video, I think that the only reason that we did was to see if the world really did end."
3,Decent diversion,"Top flight actress in this movie. It was obviously low budget and did not quite come together. But if you want a couple of hours of diversion, it will do."
3,Different,"This was really a big twist on the whole ""End of The World"" movies. I did find a lot of parts a bit slow but I think all in all a decent movie and at times fun to watch."
4,Friend found,"If you get past the really clunky title, you'll find a pretty good movie. Carell and Knightley have great chemistry. I was a little worried it would be too sad or depressing, but thankfully it mostly stayed clear of that. It's funny and smart. If you like Steve Carell, especially in his more rom-com roles (like Crazy Stupid Love), you'll like this movie."
4,What will you do if the world is ending?,"Here's The Lowedown on ""Seeking a Friend for the End of the World"" (A Comedy/Drama DVD review)...Loved It!Genre: 8.5 Movie: 6Become a fan of ""The Lowedown"" on FacebookWhat's it about?As an asteroid nears Earth, a man finds himself alone after his wife leaves in a panic. He decides to take a road trip to reunite with his high school sweetheart. Accompanying him is a neighbor who inadvertently puts a wrench in his plan.What did I think?I am not a Steve Carell fan, but I liked him in this. Keira Knightley was sweet, adorable, and funny in this film...reminiscent of the first ""Pirates of the Carribbean"". If the world was really coming to an end, I think it would be more like that. There'd be riots and looting and drug use, but more people that just want one last look at love."
3,Doable Read,"Kindle edition review for Infelice by Augusta Jane Evans Wilson: this book does have an unusual story line, well explained in another review. It is also fairly long, and for me, tedious at times. Add one star if you appreciate super long descriptions. I don't particularly enjoy mixes between Bible references and philosophy, so you could add another star if that is not an issue for you.The Kindle edition that I read contains dozens of errors, spelling, capitalization, punctuation and the like. The funniest was ""guilt clock"" rather than ""gilt clock"". Also ""many"" rather than ""marry,"" ""views"" instead of ""veins,"" ""tea-fold"" rather than ""ten-fold,"" so you get the gist of it, like it was scanned and not rechecked afterward. I see that the edition that I read is ""no longer available"" so perhaps this was addressed, but I cannot say for sure."
1,about as interesting as a bowl of oatmeal,"i had the same experience as a previous review, this was horrible to try to drive cross country to. i had to turn it off to not fall asleep, then threw it away rather than pass it on to any of my friends. i wouldnt want then to have the same fate."
1,Giraffe: poorly narrated,"What a waste. The narrator could not distinguish between different people talking to one another, leaving you in mass confusion as to who is doing what. There is no inflection for any emotion. For a very slow moving story, some emotion in the voice would have been helpful. Very poor choice for a long drive. To stay awake driving, I finally had to turn it off. We are giving this one away quickly."
3,I am not a Giraffe,"Admittedly, I only read the first third of this book. I comment only to save others similar trouble. You should only read this if YOU ARE A GIRAFFE and even then probably only if you were a giraffe that lived under CCCP-style communism. I eventually came to understand something of the giraffe ethos and could appreciate the book, but my coworkers were perplexed by my long bouts of silence and placement of things needlessly very high on shelves."
2,I really wanted to like this book,"Having lived in the Czech Republic since 1987, I was looking forward to this book which addresses a story that is relatively unknown - even among the Czechs.I was, however, rather disappointed. I felt that Czech trivia was thrown in wherever it fit - and at times in places where it did not. I also was unsure why there had to be a lesbian scene in the text. It seemed rather arbitrary. But most of all, the lack of variation in writing style - where 80% of the sentences start with the word ""I"" followed by the verb, meant that I often found myself skimming through sections. Lastly, as a linguist, I love esoteric vocabulary; however, I found the use of such words to be pretentious rather than poetic.The story is a good one, but I feel that the delivery was less than the story deserved."
1,Am I the only one? Spoiler Warning,"I hated Giraffe. Everything about it was plodding and depressing. Even though I knew how the book would end, I found it nearly impossible to read the grueling accounts of the giraffes' execution. When I read in a preview that one of the narrators is a giraffe, I was intrigued enough to read the novel. However, the ""giraffe's voice"" was as boring as those of the humans'. One reviewer quoted on the back of the paperback edition says that this book will probably change your life [for the better]. To the contrary, I regret the waste of days of my life mired in the reading of Giraffe."
1,This is NOT a book for crafters !,"I'm really not sure what the purpose of this book is.It is NOT a craft book - there are no instructions, and actually many of the items can be bought from the suppliers listed in the back of the book.Some of the ideas in the book:- serve Chinese fortune-cookies in a white paper Chinese take-away container.- place small candies in a 6-inch square of Japanese paper, ""pull all four corners together, and tie with a linen string.""-""Think twice about throwing away old boxes. Cover them in different-colored papers and use to store notions, seaside finds, or whatever you like.""I didn't need an expensive little book to tell me these ""ideas.""I'm sorry that I wasted my excitement and money!"
3,Inspirational book vs. a craft how-to book,Paper Details is more of an inspirational ideas book and not a craft how-to book that others may be under the assumption of. The book offers many photos to browse through for ideas in using paper items you may already have around the house. There is also a supply source list in the back of the book to reference for purchasing paper items featured.Ideas presented in the book range from ho-hum (stick some fortune cookies in a Chinese take-out container) to aha! cute gift-wrapping ideas. Use this book for inspiration along with your own creativity. I feel the book could have benefited from adding a few actual craft projects with patterns to photocopy. I also feel that a larger format would have made it easier to view the photographs.
5,HUNTER IS A MASTER OF HER CRAFT!,"Whether it's suspense or humor, Jillian Hunter provides story telling perfection and has since I first read her work in 1986. Her talent should be applauded. Her storytelling capabilities are some of the finest in this or any other genre. Once again, Hunter delivers with Indiscretion, a superbly crafted story that takes the reader on a roller coaster ride that keeps one fixated and enthralled from first page to last. This book deserves to be on the top of everyone's To Be Read list--not to mention the Best seller lists! Bravo, Hunter, for once again giving us our money's worth!"
4,Remarkably funny,"This must be the most funny book I've ever read ! Although the story is weak, and the language could have been better, I will still recommend it to everyone who wants to laugh and dream themselves away for a while.Anne Kerr and Patrick Sutherland have been sent to Scotland to investigate a murder mystery. But this is not the only reason. Patrick's aunt is behind, and hopes to make a couple of the two hotheads. In order to avoid suspicion, Patrick has to pose as Anne's butler, a role he neither wants, nor is well fitted for. When Anne receives a suitor, Patrick is enraged with jealousy, and does his best to sabotage, creating the most hilarious situations."
3,Did I miss something?,I just don't understand all the positive customer reviews.It was an ok book. I didn't think the repartee was all that great. Some of it was pretty trite. There were some funny lines but the author seemed to run out of wit as the story wore on.I feel cheated. I was relying on the customer reviews to guide my purchase. That's why I had to write this one. Try Amanda Quick for a good mystery and witty repartee. She never fails.Maybe I've been too tough on JH as she seems to be new at this. The story had potential. I just felt she could have done so much more with it.In all honesty I do have to say I liked the characters. I would have liked to know them better however.
4,Funny and charming,"This book was just as hilarious as Ms. Hunter's previous books. Both the hero and heroine as likeable and believable. The only reason I did not rate it with five stars is the less-than-strong plot, a supposed ""murder mystery"" with a somewhat muddled solution. ""Indiscretion"" is definately worth a read, though, if for nothing else than Ms. Hunter's fine dialogue and her great comedic situations."
4,Learn about our recent history,"I found this book to be very interesting and informative about a part of our culture that too many people dismiss. Learn about the history of mobile travel from Conestoga Wagons to the new manufactured housing. I came to appreciate the culture of mobile home communities and why people choose to live in manufactured housing. I gained a new perspective on my culture. Easy to read, interesting, and relevant in today's communitites. Helps for understanding those around us."
5,"This Goes On the ""Keeper Shelf""","Steve Brown's first book is a fabulous introduction with a keen insight into prayer, written in a down-to-earth language. He affirms where you've been, complete with the good parts and the bad parts. He offers you the opportunity to go deeper, but insists it all depends on God calling you there. I borrowed the copy from church, and had to underline. So I bought another copy for the church, and put the purloined, underlined copy on the Keeper Shelf. A simply great read."
3,"works, but...","It works, but the stand component doesn't lock in place as well as expected (it's a bit awkward). Perhaps this is why the price is lowest among competition. I will consider paying more for competitor options next time."
4,"Better than ""Relish""","I'm still waiting for a new album, though. Joan is perhaps the most underrated singer today. ""One of Us""--a good song--did nothing to show the world her voice. At least it got a few of us to check her out. As incredible as she is live, this stellar disk still doesn't do her voice justice!!"
5,Do you REALLY want to know Joan Osborne?,"Look no further than this compilation CD of her early works, before she was signed to major label deal. Here, her first live CD (""Live at Delta 88"") and studio EP (or two...I forget) are distilled into a great document. Without question, Ms Osborne is the kind of raw/gritty singer who should not be tamed or molded by a hotshot producer or record company demands for a hit single. She should be on the stage singing blues, soul and rhythm and blues standards with a few tasty originals mixed in, and that's what's presented here in all it's glory. If you're one of those original Joan fans who remembers her gigs at places like Wetlands Preserve (when anyone who was anyone on the downtown scene was apt to sit in for a song or two - Blues Traveler, the Spin Doctors, God Street Wine, etc.), then you'll get a real nostalgia kick out of this treasure."
5,One of my fav's for several years,My husband bought this and has never gotten a 2nd chance to listen to the cd without asking me for it. This has to be one of the best modern bluesy female singers recordings I have heard. The depth of her voice is paramount. This cd blows her others off the charts. Must have for any cd collection!
3,The Birth of Joan!,"I like this CD...and I don't like this CD. I like it because this is the unique, ballsy, bluesy Joan from her best CD to date...""Relish"". She let's it rip on this old recording instead of toning herself down as she's done on almost all of her most recent CD's (even though I like that Joan too). What I don't like is that she's way too much into the raspy, scratchy Janis Joplin style on nearly every song on this old club recording. But I see it as a snapshot of her evolution as a special talent. When you think that she went from this to ""Relish"" and other CD's, you can really see her development. She is indeed an outstanding talent who deserves more attention."
2,Wanting for more,"I'm a BBVD fan, but was disapointed on this one. Too much talk and not enough Voodoo."
2,Not the Original Edition,"We borrowed an older edition of this book from a friend and were impressed with it enough to want to order our own copy. So we found the book with the same author and same title on the internet. However it has been revised since the original. We wish that it has said ""Revised"" or something similar with the title. The original was in KJV, however this one is in Newer Versions. It just doesn't read the same! Effort had gone into it to change each Scripture reference throughout the book. At least the option ought to still be there to obtain it in the Version of your preference."
1,Please DO NOT make this mistake,"I purchased a 2 year warranty for my GS150 camcorder. I was supposed to recieve the contract via email/snail mail. I waited for a month and did not get anything. So I called them on thie toll free number. The lady I spoke to was really Rude and spoke as though I had committed a crime by calling them. She said I will recieve their contract by mail. I wait another month and do not get anything. I call them 2 more times and they say it will reach me within 2 weeks. With such a start, I am just hoping my camera holds itself well cause I will be not at all confident in contacting them for issues. Hope Amazon removes them from thier site and get someone better.Only plus was there was not much of a wait time when I called. Maybe they do not have many customers calling them :)"
5,almost unique--sadly enough,"Cozzens' book is particularly important because it uncovers the extent to which clerical culture in the Catholic Church is engaged in systematic denial of its weaknesses, and almost unique because Cozzens himself is a cleric and a former rector of a seminary, so he knows whereof he speaks. And, I imagine, is paying a certain price for his willingness to bring a few skeletons out of the closet. His approach is pragmatic, not ideological, and he can be accused neither of being a disaffected liberal nor a disgruntled ex-priest. Pay attention to what he says!"
2,The One & Only,"While most of the tunes on this CD are dull and lifeless covers, and the audio clips from a handfull of NBA games are oddly chosen and aurally challenged, it IS worth owning, because it is the one and only place where you can get a full-length copy of Marvin Gaye's fantastic version of the Star Spangled Banner, recorded live at the 1983 NBA All-Star Game. It's a miraculous rendition, spoiled somewhat by a corny 'sounds of the game' intro and some sound engineer twisting too many knobs about two minutes in."
5,a mysterious and desirable scent,"This is one of the early women's fragrances launched by Boucheron. It is more dramatic than Initial, highlighted by a floral Oriental tone.Jaipur or ""jewel"" was inspired by a trip made by the company's current president's grandfather to Jaipur, a city whose reputation for precious stones was legendary. Thus, the fragrance was introduced in a jewel flacon. The original bottles are, of course, highly prized by collectors today.Long recognized as makers of elegant, luxurious jewelry Boucheron began in 1830 when the first store opened in Paris. It was not until 1988 that the first Boucheron fragrance was launched."
3,Did not hold my child's attention,"While this movie may be good, my 7 year old, who wanted to see it after the 2 minute preview, could not stick with this movie. Perhaps it is better suited to the whole family watching together, or to older children."
3,movie,The product purchased was in the condition that was described. It came on time and the kids are going to love it. Thanks again
3,fun but weak,"it was entertainment, far from Emmy, Owen did his best, great for kids, as Marmaduke messes up once moved to a new home no one likes, and trys to fit in with the new hip group"
4,Great update on a classic.,Owen Wilson was the perfect voice for this new update to the Marmaduke story. My 7 year old daughter and I are always looking for funny animal videos and this was one of the best! George Lopez is also great as the cat and could have been used even more. Cute movie. You will enjoy.
1,Nothing to do with Marmaduke cartoon,"Let me start by saying that the only similarity between the Maramduke cartoon and this movie is that the main character is a Great Dane named Maramaduke and his male adult owner is named Phil. After that it's just another teenager moves to a new town, tries to fit in, acts stupid, loses all friends, then finds true self. Only been done thousands of time. The twist with this movie that it's a teenage dog instead of a human.Jokes are predictable, acting is mediocre. Animation of Maramduke okay, other dogs not so much so. Campy dog dance routine at end is terrible.If you must see this move, borrow it from you local library or a friend that unfortunately bought it."
1,Not Happy,"I bought this movie for my 2 year old granddaughter and the movie skipped all the way through. And she watches only a few movies ALL the time, this being one of them. So I had to return the movie to the seller. So we weren't very happy campers."
1,Why Oh!! Why,"When you see the source material (Sunday comics section in local papers), you understand in two seconds why this sucks. Its like making Charlie Brown Live action with the fat kid from super-bad. The stories were more like the Beethoven movies, tales of a real big dumb dog (more than likely the cartoonists). Only these were stories of what a real dog would do on a daily basis, not surfing, or dancing. This is an embarrassing project from start to finish."
1,Wouldn't play,"Never got to see the movie. I just got an error message after it dowloaded. I paid for it, but never got to see it!"
2,Not a Great Dane,"Obviously, the people who made this movie had never lived with a Great Dane, nor had they read the Marmaduke comic strip. Disappointing."
3,good clean funny movie,Decent movie for the price.. By far not the best animatedI have watched...but...the kids liked it. Isnt that whats itsall about? the kids!
5,Marmaduke,I made this purchase as a birthday present for my great-grandson who is seven now. He has watched the DVD at least a dozen times. Mom says he simply loves it.
5,Marmaduke - the Man with the Plan,"If this is not the funniest movie, then what can top it? Of course, I have a soft spot for talking animals... and the opening and closing with the same phrase twice from this huge lovable dog takes the cake... mind you, being a cat person, Siamese especially, having the Mexican accented straight man (oriental cat) behind this canine, well, wear rubber pants if drinking beer during the show..."
3,Marmaduke,"It was a pretty good movie, however, for a kids movie it had too much adult humor. It is not something I would suggest getting for your kids Dvd library."
1,"I LOVE DOGS, BUT THIS MOVIE NEEDS A POOPER SCOOPER!","Before I review this film I want to state for the record that I do like smart family friendly films(I happen to love the comic strip Marmaduke also), but unlike Alvin and the Chipmunks or How to Train your Dragon, this film is just one bad joke after another. I'm sure the really little kids will find something to laugh about here and parents may like the film because their kids like it, but for everyone else this film is boring with very little humor.The film starts and ends with a dog F A R T joke(ha-ha very funny)! This isn't as bad as the two Chihuahua movies, but it isn't so much better than I can give it above a 1 1/2 star rating......probably 2 1/2 stars for very young children, but there are so many better films to introduce your children to. Please give your kids more credit than this steaming pile!"
2,Eh,"Okay, I am not a child so I'm not really sure what I was expecting. For some reason I thought this movie had potential, what with all the positive reviews and Owen Wilson voicing the lead character; I thought it would be funny in a light and goofy way. However, the humor is seriously lacking and the plot is extremely formulaic and cliched. It wasn't the worst movie ever--and some young kids might enjoy it-- but there are definitely much better animal flicks out there, like Homeward Bound, Cats and Dogs, Babe... films which can be enjoyed by all ages."
5,Condemnations from those who have not read this book!!,"I have just now ordered the book and am sure I will love it; cannot say for certain until I've read it. But I am amused by the number of people who have submitted reviews who REFUSE to read it, then go on to slam it, because Pres. & Mrs. Bush have written the foreward. Is this not typical of self-blinkered liberals? They criticize and mean to censor that which they have not even read. Shouldn't the book be reviewed for its content by people who have actually read it, not by ideologues who condemn it without having read a word of it? The mere fact that it raises the shackles of those who don't want to be confused by facts means it is probably terrific."
3,Political partisanship is a detractor...,"I must agree partially with Maryland that having the first family introduce the book gives an aire of political partisanship and renders the work suspect. However, I must disagree with Maryland in that the book is well written for family use and it hits all the watershed events of American history. Ms. Hakim is fair to all races, creeds, and classes of society and accurately reflects the nature and character of the American spirit. But in the end, the introduction might very well alienate many of the liberals, socialists, and Democrats - those who lack an appreciation of accurate American history. A better choice might have been Arnold Schwartzeneger and Rosie O'Donnell."
3,Agree with Maryland,"I was excited to hear about this book and all ready to buy it until I saw the George and Laura Bush as ""co-authors"". Come on. An appointed president with no conscious won't be trying to teach my kids his version of history."
1,Not On My Bookshelf,"I was eagerly looking forward to Ms Hakim's new book;""Freedom, a History of US"". My family has very much enjoyed her 10 book series for young people; in particular we have appreciated Ms Hakim's ability to deal quite objectively with some of the less savoury aspects of American history. The new book will not be on my family's bookshelf. George W and Laura Bush were inappropriate and offensive choices for the forward. I question both Ms Hakim and her publisher in making this decision. Jimmy Carter or George Mitchell would have been far better choices."
1,This Book Gets No Stars,"I was set to buy this book. I am a homeschooling mom, and we have devoured all Joy Hakim's history books. But, I cannot, in good conscience, require my children to read what will obviously be political propaganda. It seems that many people, myself included, consider Bush to be a Freedom Oppressionist. It is unfortunate that he was chosen to represent this book."
2,No Tony = No Platters,"This is a reasonable average group like hundreds of others, it's not ""THE PLATTERS"" we all know, the ones with Tony Williams and Co.These guys should be called ""The Platters Rev.1"", I believe there has also been a poorer quality Rev.2. Many years ago for sometime they were called The New Platters"", this would avoid a lot of disappointments.The quality of the recording is quite good STEREO but..I listen to the real ""THE PLATTERS"".Ciao,Franco"
5,Tennis balls.,I thought I already made this review. It is now 3.5.09. I found the shipment of the tennis balls to be timely. The product was in good condition when it arrived. Thank you.
5,must have,"Aside from this being an exceptional listing of cryptoids and legendary creatures this book has an interesting spin on some of their paranormal qualities.Right up there with material like Keel,Sanderson,Heuvelmans,Coleman,Clark,etc."
4,Code Scout OK,I purchased the AutoXray 1500 CodeScout to read computer codes from my Volvo. It worked/works fine except for one thing. The advertising did not say (and should have said) that it does not turn off the engine maintenance reminder light. I may have looked for another code reader if I had known that.
1,Fails to read,"My new Code Scout arrived today & I spent an hour trying to get it to work. It easily connects just fine but cannot read at all. Tech support went though the process with me as I tried several more times & finally said to send it back for replacement (At MY expense!) Well, it is not my 2000 auto since it was read just fine for emission testing last month and had a check engine light code read & reset just fine by a mechanic 2 weeks ago. Tech support agrees that it sounds like it is a problem with the code reader. I'll probably purchase a different brand locally since I don't trust this brand & I'd need to pay Shipping again if I need to return the replacement unit."
2,It is not worth the effort to do research with microcase.,"For a social research methods class we had to use microcase. It was a diaster. The student version does not work very well. The whole system crashed on me. I had to recode all my data, just because of a fault with the program. It was not made for student researchers."
3,flamenco book,"A nice to hear solos, very close to paco pena toques flamencos ,yet with less difficulties .Good for 2 to 3 years of experience guitar playing"
3,Horrible or Darkly Funny?,"To be honest, I'm not even sure. Part of me wants to give it five stars for the funny bits in it - the kids cussing at the teachers and the positive lesson that the VP learned (to care for kids and all) and the sheer offensiveness of it - and then I want to give it a one star because of that very same sheer offensiveness in there. The positive reviewers are right to like it, the negative reviewers are right to hate it, so I'll give it a 50/50 rating and give it three out of five stars. I can tell you, it's probably not what you would expect."
3,A good time,"If you're looking for a fun, no pressure movie that you can just sit back and relax with, this one's for you. Not the most complicated of plots, but certainly has its funny parts and charm. Rob Corddry is a comedic genius in my opinion, and I always enjoy his performances. This movie was no exception. Overall a good time, if you're aware of what you're watching, which is a simple comedic picture."
4,Elementary school has never been so diabolical.,"Jason Biggs plays a failed hostage negotiator who decides to take a less stressful job as a guidance councelor at a failing elementary school being run into the ground by a crooked principal played by Rob Corddry. Eva Longoria plays a school distict auditor with a ""slight"" drug addiction that has been hired to determine why the little school is in trouble. For Jason, Eva was the one girl that got away that he never could forget. Laugh out loud funny."
5,"A Weird, Little Film That Made Me Laugh in Spite of Its Many Flaws","I knew when I rented Lower Learning that I'd have to adapt my standards to the direct to DVD level to enjoy it, but I was in the mood for a cheap laugh. I wasn't offended by this film. I found it to be quite funny at times. Maybe the people who are reviewing this are not the film's target audience, because there is nothing in Lower Learning that would offend fans of Family Guy, for example, and I think that people who find Family Guy funny will find something to laugh about in Lower Learning."
5,Big bang for just a few bucks,"I purchased this set about four months ago. I previously had a set of mismatched Sabian cymbals, and wanted to add another crash and a ride. Forget the Sabians. They're now sitting in my closet gathering dust. These cymbals sound great!What really impressed me was the quick decay and low ring. The Sabian crash I was using would hum forever. Not so with the MCS. A vicious attack followed up by quick decay and just a tad of hum. I spent quite a while searching for a set of cymbals that would fit my price range and that I wouldn't regret the sound. I am thrilled with the MCS set.The free china is spectacular!"
4,Meinl MCS cymbals,"I'm a newbie; wanted a step above entry level cymbals. Read many reviews and decided upon the Meinl MCS pack. So far, so good. Shipping was great; received faster that anticipated."
5,A mystery for gen X and Y,A great book with hysterical characters. The twin sisters who are the detectives in the book cause more chaos than and three Stephanie Plum's. If you like Evanovich you will love this book. Also look at books by Robert Eversz.
4,"Quick, Fun Read","The Butcher of Beverly Hills is exactly what you would expect - a funny, cute murder mystery. There were a few laugh out loud moments as twin private investigators Kerry and Terry bumble their way through the whodunit. This book was in the same vein as the Stephanie Plum novels. It's a somewhat formulaic mystery with just enough quirks and twists to stand out.I felt that the number of characters was a bit confusing at times. There were a few too many red herrings. All in all the story was enjoyable and entertaining. There was a some romance elements in it, but nothing too overbearing. I was looking for a silly story to read and I found exactly what I wanted. I debated between 3 or 4 stars - it's really 3 1/2 but because it delivered what I expected, it got 4 start from me. I plan to purchase the next in this series."
1,very disappointed!,"I have had intractable migraines for the last seven years, so almost all of my time is spent in bed, reading. As a result, I am always looking for mysteries that are light-hearted and funny; about all I can tolerate in my life right now are happy endings. Based on the reviews I read, I ordered The Butcher of Beverly Hills, mainly because of the comparison to the Stephanie Plum series, and I cannot tell you how disappointed I was. Say what you will about Stephanie Plum, at least the characters in the series, although a little over-drawn, are all least three-dimentional and believable; I can certainly imagine meeting Grandma Mazer in a grocery store in New Jersey, for example. I certainly cannot say that about the characters that people The Butcher of Beverly Hills - I found them to be flat and highly unbelievable. I won't say the book was awful, but it was definitely second-tier."
5,Helping me Overcome,"This is an excellent book for anyone desiring to understand the origin of the emotion of anger and how to effectively deal with it. The author lays out a personal action plan for overcoming anger manifested in both the conscious and subconscious realms of the mind. This action plan has helped me to overcome many layers of suppressed anger over the many hurts and disappointments in my childhood. Recently, it has helped me to overcome anxiety attacks that I was experiencing over a situation at work. As a result, I am becoming a happier person with less emotional baggage. I highly recommend this book for the individual who wants freedom from anger problems."
3,Red Mist,"Not alot to say, other than typical ""I know what you did last summer"" type movie, with young cast of way too beautiful (no way all those hot chicks work in one place, not in real life, no. I mean at least one has to be fat and ugly... come on...) women and all, with the one self righteous one, slutty one, goth one, and the other two in between... Same plot, same story. Nothing really exiting. The only thing I couldnt call was the final scene. So, OK, they got me there."
3,I think I Mist something.,Was not this the same concept in The Lawnmower Man? It's okay but nothing spectacular.
5,Nice Ornament,It is a very nice ornament with good detail and just so happens to look very similar to our current greyhound.
1,Convoluted,"The people who gave this book five stars must be on Ms. Alexander's payroll. I have dearly loved several of her books, but the plot lines in this one were so extraordinarily contrived that I ceased to care about the characters only half-way through the book. There is no emotional involvement between the two leads and absolutely no depth to them whatsoever. The dialogue is way too modern, even for me (I'm not usually a stickler for historical accuracy, but this was too much). I have to admit I didn't even finish the book. When the heroine became furious with the hero (enough to say she never wanted to see him again) over something he did that was actually a kind, above the call of duty gesture because it wounded her pride - I'd had enough. The last sixty pages will remain forever unread. Please save yourselves the $7."
2,...What?,"I wanted so bad to love this! But it was sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo boring. Too much dialogue, too much of this, too much of that, where is the romance? It went soooooooooo slow. They weren't even the least bit intimate until page 300-something. 300 pages of nonsense!"
2,Let it be.... over!,"I was so excited to read the next Victoria Alexander. I'm sorry to say, this book is very slow with very little romance or sensuality. As another reviewer noted, these two characters (Jonathan and Fiona) are pretty bland together. Fiona has the spunk we like to see in a heroine, but Jonathan is just a bore. Their interactions are aimed, I think, at being sensually teasing, but they just come off silly. The plot is also silly and not very intriguing. Frankly, I couldn't wait for it to be over. Hope the next one from her is better! Don't waste your money on this one."
3,Disappointing,"I too was excited to read the latest Victoria Alexander novel, but it just fell flat. It was a nice enough story-but there was just no passion. I didn't really feel the connection between the characters, and the conflicts that always arise, just didn't have any zing. To be honest, I couldn't have cared less if Fiona and Jonathan ever got together...I was even rooting for Mr Whathisname by the end!! Usually I love this authors work, but this is one to pass on."
3,Let It Be Love - a male Effington story!,"It was nice to read the story of a male Effington. I've certainly been charmed by all those women and have seen snippits of Jonathan Effington - so this was a nice change. He was a most believable and consistent hero.Fiona was an interesting match for him. I'm still not sure about some of her character turn abouts - but she was always interesting.It was a good read for the holidays.Does Judith get a story???? If not, who is next in the Effington saga?Keep writing, Ms. Alexander!"
1,ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ,"What a snooze. I am always on the hunt for a good book and Victoria Alexander has always fit the bill. However, her last two attempts have been less than exciting. I only finished it because I wanted something to read but man, BORING!"
5,masterpiece,never heard such attention devoted to meaningful songwriting. a guaranteed classic. #1 window is way ahead of it's time.
1,Not worth buying.,"This camera has all the features to make it look like a buy, but it's not worth it. First, the motion detection is worthless it only sends an email with snapshots that are corupt most of the time. The Camera Viewer that must be used with the camera in order to record video, doesn't compress the video and again most of the time the utility will not play back saved videos."
2,Almost useless.,"The original book had full color sketches and descriptions, that's why it has the word sketches in the title. This version is completely without pictures. I downloaded the Google version and converted it instead."
2,Boring.,"The animation quality is pretty high, actually, but I could not get into this movie, because the story was simply way too dull. The characters are somewhat memorable... some of them. I enjoyed the beginning of the story, but it was a little slow-paced. The ending was very childish and predictable, like the old G.I. Joe cartoons. The lame story was probably a bottleneck for what was otherwise a good movie."
5,Best Book I've Ever Read!,"Well, I'm only on chapter 6...but this book is amazing! It feels like you're RIGHT there in the book...and it's so exciting. Even though nobody lives on Krakatoa in real life-this book tells a totally different story and I really love that. It's a tie between The 21 Balloons and The Tale Of Despereaux for the best book I've ever read. I can't decide...hmm? =0) Anyways...I love this book so much and certainly reccommend it!! (I DEFINITELY SEE WHY IT HAS A NEWBERRY AWARD)"
4,"How to take a long hard look in your closet, and start cleaning out!","After reading NOTHING TO WEAR? I was inspired to see myself as other see me.First took everything out. If it was too small, worn or I never liked it anyway, it went into the give away bag. Then I start mixing and matching while looking at a full length image of me. If it looked dumpy--it went. If it need mending--went into the mending basket, and if I didn't have a top that matched the skirt--it went on the shopping list.Now I can really walk into my walk-in closet and select an outfit at a moments notice. I know the outfit look good on me, fits perfectly and I can dress in less than half the time. Also got all new clothes hangers, all turned toward me.Gave the book to my daughter who did exactly the same thing."
2,Basic with one bonus,"This is a useful book on the basics of wardrobe creation, maintenance, and rotation, with one bonus idea that I found useful: picking a personality trait to describe your style, and using that to check out potential purchases as well as evaluate what you already own. Are you whimsical? Avant-garde? or Classic? There are five (the other two are Chic and Bohemian) and the definitions and descriptions for each, plus ideas for when you're partly one and partly another, were helpful and somewhat new to me."
2,visual therapy? no pictures!,"They call it ""visual therapy"" but they use mostly words to describe the types of worerobes. If you don't know your style yet, reading this book won't help you much. If you know your style already, you will know all the common sense already in this book. I usually finish a book I startes. This one, I kept thinking I wasted my money and time."
4,80's revisited with caribbean spice!,"If you like Jay McInerney (""Bright Lights Big City"", or my favourite ""Story of My Life"",) you'll love this book! It's brain candy to be sure, but there is enough tragedy to give a genuine depth to the book. I've spent a lot of time in Freeport, Bahamas and found the fictional history of Grand Bahama Island amusing, but a lot of the descriptions of life in Freeport are completely true! Give it a try, you just might like it!"
4,I wish she was my kids teacher,This book hits the target most of the time. The author is really anti-drugs for ADHD and some children need medications but thats my only complaint about this book. I think the rest of it is on target and people should read it and think about the things Louann Johnson is saying such as detention is a bad idea. I was one of those bad kids back in school and detention never helped me. It made me hate school. The best thing in this book is the stuff about light sensitivity because when I tried putting a blue plastic sheet over the book my daughter can read a lot better. I wish LouAnne was a teacher at my kids school. I think they would be happier and they would learn more.
3,Acid Drops - Kenneth Williams,"Once again, Kenneth Williams shows us the carefully scripted side of his personality which is conservatively witty but also delightfully acerbic. In private and among his friends, however, he was outrageous as any flaming queen.However, his misuse of words belies the fact that his ever-present dictionary failed to consider the correct use of some of his less widely used descriptions.A great addition to the library of all KW fans...."
4,Movie,This is a history lesson you will not learn in school? how many people know that monument sits there in the middle of a housing addition. well worth watching!!!!!
3,A fairly decent movie,"Kirk Cameron did a reasonably decent review of how the Puritans did so much to shape what American became. He looked at the struggles they went through for years prior to settling some of their people in Massachusetts, where they met with more hardship. This is a documentary, but it is a somewhat biased documentary. Some unfavorable incidents concerning how the Massachusetts settlement dealt with those different from themselves were completely ignored. A documentary is to examine the good and the bad in a subject. Because of all the research Cameron did, he should be commended. But ignoring important things does not make a five-star documentary."
5,Monumental,Great DVD; will open your eyes to the truth about how America came to be.Kirk Cameron has great movies
5,"Finally, a history that makes sense and means something.","This documentary clearly explains the circumstances and motivations of those who laid the very first foundations on which the USA was built and on which it thrived...until more recent history. The passion, self sacrifice and unbelievable perseverence that the Pilgrims demonstrated as they faced so much suffering and ongoing threats to their lives and the lives of their children can only be explained by their relationship with God and by His providence.This fascinating film captures the truth that our founders knew we would need today and that they preserved for us in bricks and mortar."
4,Good documentary,This is a very accurate and educational documentary! I learned so much about America.Fascinating! It just moved a little slow at times.
5,A great insight into God's dealings with the earth and its people,I am grateful to Kirk Cameron for his efforts in putting this movie together. I found it very inspirational. It is well worth the money to purchase it and the time to watch it. It should be shared with all our children.
4,"Kirk Cameron's ""Monumental"" DVD",I believe these type movies should be shown in schools across America. We need to drastically restore pride in our American heritage.
4,Historically Informative.,"If you believe in God, and love this country, you'll enjoy this documentary. Well done, and historically informative. I thought the statue on the cover was the Statue of Liberty. It's not! It's so much more."
5,Best Pilgrim heritige film,"A thought provoking film about the faith and character of our Pilgrim forfathers, and the National Moment they left us which most people and never even heard of -very revealing. What every American should know."
