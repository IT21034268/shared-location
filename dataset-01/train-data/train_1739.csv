3,Not a easy reading text.,"Master Ito did had a nice writing style. But the notation is too delicated and messy, you must spend lots time to get into it. This makes this book not good for self studying. Moreover, this outdated book may not fit for some teachers who rush to cover too much material in a semester. I think K. Ito was meant to teach these stuff carefully and slowly. If you have a good instructor, then this book would be helpful. If someone can improve Master Ito's notation, this would be very worthy book with this price."

3,Not Bad,"This is kinda funny, In the picture they feature Randy Orton VS Benoit. When I recieved my copy it only had Taker and JBL on the cover but the benoit match is still on the dvd. It's a re'release from 2007 jus so they could take him off the box, lol"

ORTON V BENOIT WAS GOOD & GOOD MOMENT AFTERWARDS! THE REST OF THE PPV IS SOLID & REWATCHABLE, IT'S NO SUMMERSLAM 2002 BUT I'D SAY IT'S ALMOST ON THE LEVEL WITH SUMMERSLAM 2000!"

Less than 1 star( only 0,25 star)The no.1 conteder I hope Orlando Jordan because if OR the no 1 conteder JBL will not become his friend again. I hate JBL and Orlando Jordan on Smackdown. That PPV is suck but isn't suck as No Mercy 2004 when UT lost to JBL because the damn Heidenreich."
5,Best of the year,Summerslam was the best pay per view i've watched in a long time. I enjoyed every match.. Kurt angle's returned for a 5 star match. JBL showed me alot against the undertaker with his resilence and Randy Orton took his rightful spot at the top.... cant get ne better
1,What's Going to Happen In the World Of Worst Wrestling,"Wrestling is all fake watch something like PRIDE or UFC. You're all obsessed by this, so here's what I want you to do.

1,WWE has Fallen fast,"Wow has WWE tooken a big fall this year , in 2003 i thought they could turn it back around but it seems like its just gotten worst from JBL to been champion from Triple H been champion 24/7 this era is the worst wrestling has ever been in. Lets hope they turn it around soon or else were all in trouble. Alls we got left to hope for is that TNA pulls through."

4,It's Bizzaroland!,"1) Dudley's vs. Rey, Kidman, & London- good opener. Great way to start the show off. 4/52) Kane vs. Matt Hardy- I liked this match. The chokeslam at the end was awesome. 5/53) John Cena vs. Booker T.- big dissapointment. Booker held most of the offense until the F-U in the end. 2/54) Edge vs Y2J vs. Batista- pretty good match. The crowd boo's Edge. 4/55) Kurt Angle vs. Eddie Guerrero- Great match. Best smackdown match of the night. 5/56) Triple H vs. Eugene- Good match. The fans boo Eugene. Eugene uses the stunner, rock bottom, leg drop, and pedigree. 5/57) JBL vs. Taker- Not the best match. A little slow. The fans were hilarious. The Wave. DQ at the end. 3/58) RKO vs. Benoit- Best of the night. Destiny awaits Randy Orton. The youngest champion is history. 5/5"

4,WWE Summerslam Come on Randy!!!,"Chris Benoit vs Randy Orton. I think that Orton will get the victory and the Orton/Triple H rivalry will begin.JBL VS The Undertaker- JBL will win cuz no1 loses the title at their 1st PPV defence.Eddie Guerrero vs Kurt Angle - as long as its better than their wrestlemania match i'm not bothered.Triple H vs Eugene - Triple H should win because hes that damn good!!Edge vs Jericho vs Batista - Edge will win its his 1st title defence.Matt Hardy v Kane - Matt will win because Kane is entering the olympics and has 3 weeks off.Cena v Booker T - Booker T will win US TITLE WHO cares?!DUDLEYZ VS Kidman/London/Mysterio - MAKE IT A TABLE MATCH WE WANT TABLES!!!!Lets hope that summerslam can be the only good PPV since Survivor Series 2003, BRING JEFF,ROCK,HOGAN and what has happened to The Rattlesnake he just disappeared!pne rule danny ball duz aswell."
3,This is the Right CD if you're looking for the only recording of One (a chorus line),"I bought this cd for one song, One ( a chorus line). There are some other live cds of Tony Bennett live floating out there. I believe it's with Count Basie. Tony Bennett is much better on This live performance than the Basie show. Plus, the sound recording is a little better than the Basie gig. Should you buy this cd? No. The recordings on most of his old performances are terrible. Plus Mr. Bennett does not give much banter, as Sinatra or Dean Martin. But I have to give it 3 stars since it is the only recording (and best jazz swing recording) of One (a chorus line)."
5,Diggin' it,"There are some excellent, albeit completely unknown, tracks on this compilation. I was impressed. Gilles has unearthed some rare grooves that are WELL worth having if you've got any kind of a thing for 70s soul/jazz/fusion."
4,"Good scores, ok music choices","I love most of Randy Newman's music, and I love to play it on the piano. However, strangely, most of my favorite Newman songs are not in this book. It's a good book, and well worth it for God's Song, but I would've prefered some different songs."
2,Too hard,"This work is too hard. I should have sent it back, but I kept it for too long. I play from fake books, but I have played the Moonlight Sonata. This book is for professionals. It seems harder than what I saw Randy play on Austin City Limits. If you just play for fun, give this a skip, although there doesn't seem to be anything easy for his simple songs."
4,Book Review,The book Woman to Woman Mentoring by Janet Thompson was in my opinion highly ovet priced. I saw the book in the book store for approximatley $6.00. My price with you was approximately $12. It is my understanding that the book I received was used and had approximately 32 pages.
2,+ Easy To Install-Run / - Poor Audio-Video Quality,"To begin, I use an eMachine T3025 (equipped with AMD Athlon processor)running Windows XP Home Edition.+ Out of the box, the WinTV tuner was easy to install. The installation booklet dictated what is to be expected when first installing the driver. After that, the program was easy to run and setup.- The video quality was similar to watching a VCR recorded show without the annoying white lines that pass through the screen,to say the least it was poor. The sound quality of the tuner only came in mono, and to say the least AGAIN poor.It was a good buy and easy to install and run, but the major downfall was its poor video and audio quality."
2,Poor Video Quality -- Will Not Work w/MCE,My main gripe is that this card WILL NOT work with Window's new Media Center Edition. You have to install it first to find that out. Follow that up with poor video quality and a totally inadequate web support function and you have a device that's below average.
3,only for systems with pentium and celeron cpus,"this product is not complatible with motherboards that use AMD and other CPUs that aren't ""intel-based"", i.e. Celerons & Pentiums. The real fine print for this in on the last page on the install manual. One the box it says a requirement of ""pentium processor 90mhz"" but that kind of description has been used on every other product too and for the most part, you can run those products with other CPUs and etc. So I guessI ran my luck on this product. *sigh*"
3,"Another Disappointment, Chris Redfield 10th Anniversary Fig","Chris Redfield looks okay. It's not the best sculpt that I've seen, but it looks more game accurate than Jill Valentine! The main problem with this figure is that his arms are too bulky; he looks more like a guy on roid-rage! His accessories also suck big time: 1 X knife (quite possibly a re-hash of Leon's knife from the RE 4 line), several grenades (again!?!), and one assault shotgun. Chris can't even hold onto his knife, and only has a shotgun!?! Last I remember that Chris also had a variation of the Samurai Edge handgun in the game! How about a ceremonial dagger used as a defense weapon? Jeez, NECA's really screwed up this 10th Anniversary Line!Good news is that every RE 10th Anniversary figure comes with a standard base, which is a great idea for all hardcore RE collectors."
4,Good Book for Little Ones,"I used this book in my kindergarten classroom, and it really helped them understand how ladybugs grow. The illustrations and text are very simple and easy to follow. The kids enjoyed learning the song ""Ladybug, Ladybug, Fly Away"" after hearing parts of it in the story."
1,Tsuba is missing. Do not trust this image.,You see this bokken comes with a tsuba. Do not trust this image. What you will get is a bokken without a tsuba.
5,For the price I love this! Though came curved,It as held up in practice for over a year now and still my practice bokken and toy to this day! I reccomend this to all begginers or anybody looking for a cool toy!
2,how well it did,it started off looking so well. but it broke so easily. i would not reccomend this product to a child unless they have someone ot practice with.
3,Got a natural wood one...,"I ordered this a long time ago, but I have forgotten to write a review. I didn't receive a black one, I received a natural wood-stained one, and it wasn't even threaded at the handle. Overall, it's good for practice."
2,Loose guard,"I bought this practice sword a few days ago. It looks and feels good but the guards are so loose, they fall out every time I try to swing the sword. Too bad."
2,Item not as described.,"After reading the other reviews, I more or less expected very little, but still went ahead and bought one of these. I was disappointed that my item arrived with no wrapping over the handle, as the item description indicated there would be. Also came out of the box (which was a large triangular shaped box with no padding to protect the sword with a USPS envelope taped over the opening, meaning both the sword and the accessories had been free to rattle around during transport) missing a chunk from the tip."
3,good bokken but maybe not for serious kendoists,"in short, it is a good solid wooden bokken. It can take hits although I don't know about an actual match. The cloth wrapping comes off quite easily since it is glued with a cheap adhesive. Also the tsuba, hand guard, or hilt however you prefer to call it does not fit well by itself and is cheap plastic. Even with the rubber ring in front of it, it will wiggle around. To compensate for this, I put the rubber ring inside the tsuba, then forced both down to where they were supposed to be. It fit well but it was hard to move it along the bokken. For cosplay or for show it is perfect but not for something serious. It might also come a bit crooked as mine is slightly bent to the left. You cannot notice it unless you look down the bokken but if you're a perfectionist, buy something else."
1,Came With a Huge Split,"looking at this product online it is very nice looking. i read other reviews on this item that suggested that the product may come cracked or split, but i ignored this thinking that it wouldn't happen to me. it turns out that the whole top of the bokken was half split off already and i diffident even finish taking off the plastic it came in. very disappointing. I will be sending this product back."
1,Barely worth it,Describes as a Hardwood oak Boken but its not even close. It was painted a very pretty Black and the grip was nice. But it was split and if this is oak ill eat it. It was lighter by several ounces than my oak practice boken and I would NEVER use it for boken on boken or boken on jo practice. it would shatter like a piece of glass. As I said it arrived split and I would have sent it back except I needed it for the next day. So I glued and taped it together and made do. The upside? I was using it as part of a halloween costume so it worked perfectly! For 10 bucks I got what I needed but I really did expect it to be in one piece. So one star for this one.
1,crap,dont buy this it just came in today and its crap first off the handle wrapings were coming off and i would not have mindend but it just snaped in half when i hit my sofa its a kendo practice sword and shold not just brack when i hit a soft sofa seat it crap dont buy it its not worth the money if u plan to use it
5,Love It!!,I bought this for my autistic daughter who loves martial arts and she wanted to learn weapons trainning and this is amazingly great quality loved it so much i ordered another one!!
2,Garbage.,"Do NOT buy this, I was thoroughly disappointed. With already low expectations, I bought this as a present for my cousin, thinking it would be a fun screw around gift. When I received it however, the paint was gone in patches, a crack ran down the base about 4 inches, and it was cut at weird angles. I plan to return it and take my business elsewhere."
3,Ya get what ya pay,"At first i was gonna give it a 5 star, thought it was great. Used it a bit practice swings and stuff, never clanged it on anything. but for some reason the wrapping on the hilt gave and unraveled quite easily, which i wouldnt care, but half of it was covered in cheap glue that wouldnt come off, so now its garbage, be weary if you looking for something that looks cool its 5 star, if your looking to swing it, lol then i would look elsewhere"
5,Worked,"I purchased this to go with my daughters Tae Kwon Do uniform, she wore it on Halloween. This is the only thing I had to purchase. Best costume ever"
3,It is what it is,"Didn;y expect much different. It is what it is. Durable, what was advertised, and economic. Great for practice and drills."
5,Awesome,"Sturdy! They are hard, but not so hard that a hit from one is extremely painful! They are one solid piece. Great quality!"
3,Not bad,"I ordered two swords. One of them was in great condition n looked really good, however the second one's point was broken and painted over (meaning they knew it n still painted it and sold it) wasn't that happy about it. The one sword that is in good condition i am rather happy with it."
4,Good for traing but...,"It is good for training but the handle wrap comes off, this was not a problem for me because i know how to wrap a katana but if you order you should first know how because it comes of easily."
2,anyone who said the sword was well made is lying,one cactus's are hollow and its a wood sword you are a moron. two i got the sword and it wasn't even well made a the sword gaurd was not even attached when it arrived and as you play with the hilt you can feel the shoe lace like material they used weakening in your group. also the tip of the sword makes no sense kendo swords are rounded at the to like a sword sheeth and whats up with all the weird carvings on the sword going up and down it honestly reminds me of a tow sword.....
4,Awesome sword,"I bought this sword and the one with the burgandy finish, I can't be more pleased. The wrap on the handle is a nice Touch; My Guard doesn't really fit that good, but will stay in place (it just jiggles a little when I swing). Also the fact that they have weight to them helps increase the muscles in your wrist and arms. I have hit them together accidentally and they seem to hold up to the blow. Great price for an even greater sword."
4,"really good bokken, but...","the bokken arrived in five days.it came wrapped in a type of cardboard cylinder.it brought a guard, but it's a real pain to put on.in the end i decided not to put it on,besides its wood the guard is a decoration.when i removed it from the cardboard it was wrapped in plastic.the reason for the four stars is because the sword had a lot of nicks and scrapes and the sword was split from the top of the sword to about 4-5 inches into the sword.all in all totally worth the price.i plan on buying another one soon :)"
3,"Fun, but easily broken",This was awesome to pratice with. the only problem is you cant practice too hard.
3,Quality could be better,"Overall, it was pretty good, I was a little disappointed in the quality of this sword. There were several cracks in the finish of the sword. Nothing huge, just minor eyesores."
2,Pictures were very misleading,"I bought this sword, and when i got it, the package was already opened, and the sword has some engravings on the side, one side has some japanese lettering, and the other side says ""musashi"". I was expecting a blank black training sword, and that is not what i got :/"
1,hhhhh,NOT happy with this. In the first 3 days the handle string broke so now it is just a sticky mess n the garbage. NOT worth the money or anything.
1,Missing pieces /fragile,"The hand guard is missing and this ""sword"" feels very fragile. If i tried to practice fight with it , It would probably snap in two.If I pay $10 extra just to ship this product to me faster, I atleast expect all the pieces to be there."
3,somewhat pleasing,"The one piece blade and tang of wood is very sturdy, and well balanced, however, the handguard is not, and it often just slips off. Also, the poorly glued thread around the tang handle slipped off the first time I used it. You can do better than this!"
1,You get what you pay for,"This was the first bokken we bought. It was used for a special training camp for my 12 year old son.After training with it for only 5 minutes, the wood split and started splintering."
5,Excelent purchase,"Muy contento con la compra. Practico hapkido y los usamos unan vez por semana. Excelente bokken. Muy contento con la compra. Buena madera, buen mando , excelente agarre."
4,"Great Guitar,Great Keyboards!!!!","White Spirit was part of the New Wave of British Heavy Metal. Bands such as Iron Maiden, and Def Leppard emerged from the same era. White Spirit is a realy good album. It is a double CD. ""Fool for the Gods"" on CD 1 showcases Malcolm Pearson's great work on keyboard, and highlights the guitar of Janick Gers. The bright and shining star on this album is the extremely talanted, flamboyant, world class guitarist Janick Gers. Listen to his soft and poignant acoustic on CD 2 , ""Suffragettes"".White Spirit was not derivative of the NWBHM bands. They had very unique lyrics and a unique sound. The album contains an excellent documentation of the history of White Spirit.I recommend this double cd album. Buy it now!"
4,Portrait of the Blues,"Bobby `Blue' Bland's Malaco album's have been consistently solid, and `Portrait of the Blues' is no exception. It follows the same formula of the others, first rate production and arrangements, fine singing from Bland, and top-notch material from the Malaco songwriters. The songs are a mix of blues (the humorous ""She's Puttin' Something in My Food"") soul (""Ain't No Love for Sale"") ballads (""I Can Take You to Heaven Tonight"", ""When Hearts Grow Cold"") and even country-tinged material (""Hurtin' Love""). While Bland's voice isn't as strong as it once was, he can still make fine music and `Portrait of the Blues' is fine proof of this."
3,Previously printed under a different title,"Be careful! This is just a reprint of the 101 tunes in the back of Matt Cranitch's Irish Fiddle Book. It's not clear from the advertising, but there is nothing in this book that is not in the other book."
1,This is not Deana Carter - it is Dean Carter!,"Please ignore the nonsense in the review above. This is not the female country singer ""Deana Carter"", but the 1960's rock-n-roll male called ""Dean Carter"".Deana Carter's albums are fantastic and I thoroughly recommend them."
5,Deana Carter is the best female country singer out there.,"I think this is one of Deana's best yet. I can't really say that though because I love all her albums. If you are a deana fan and like all her work, this one isn't any different. She just keeps giving what her fans want. I think what makes her so unique from all the other female artists out there is that she has that strong country accent. And it stays with her throughout all her songs. Now other artist who consider themselves to be country, such as shania twain....You can't even put her into a genre anymore. Deana is no trader and it shows on this album."
4,Great for replacement,"If you don't want to pay $50.00 for a branded SLR case, this is a excellent replacement for you. It's as durable as most of the semi-hard cases, while provides you additional room for more acc. Some time you just want to pick up one on-camera lens and go, go with this one..."
2,seeker of truth,"I thought the book was really good. I would hope that the hallowed halls of American academia realizes that no longer can the biased 18th century scholarship and modern chicanery posing as research maintain its hegmony. Truth continues to be unearthed (literally), and its up to modern scholarship to either document the truth or just continue the business as usual that 18th century scholars (so-called egyptologists, archeologists)perpetuated."
2,Very low quality for the price,"I had no idea how poor quality this would be. The extremely thin, cheap-looking veneer peals off easily enough and there's not a piece of solid wood in the whole nightstand, it's all composite. That's fine for a nightstand about half the price of this one. Very disappointed."
3,It does the job,"This was a bit time consuming to put together, but in the end, did the job. The job? Hide the stuff that usually clutters the end table next to the bed (books, remotes, baby toys, etc.)."
3,Not her best....,"I have to admit, after reading Nothing to Declare I was very disappointed in this book."
2,I feel like a traitor but this isn't Ms. Morris' usual fare.,"Mary Morris is one of my favorite authors. I loved ""Nothing to Declare"" but it didn't seem as if her heart was in this one. I anxiously await her next book."
5,Moving & Magnificent,"I loved it. Mary Morris travels West this time and gets it just right. With an unfailing eye for detail, Morris takes us on a journey through a Southern California that's every bit as pumped up with hope as it was during the Gold Rush. A single-mother and writer, Morris herself might be considered both the angel and alien of her title. There are New Age encounters to be sorted through and a true love hovering in the East that needs to be put to rest. Through it all, Mary Morris lets us into her heart with language that is both spare and poetic, deeply moving, and magnificent."
4,Decent Test Review,"Pretty good summary. There are great questions, sample exam questions, tips, test advice, and of course exceptional black letter law summaries. I like the Emanuel Crunch Time series better, but this is a pretty good summary guide."
5,5 Stars for 5 years,"I've had the same DeWalt 18v XRP, with the same 2 batteries and the same charger for 5 years and haven't had a single problem with them. (knock on wood).And no, my drill hasn't spent every non-working second of it's life packed neatly in it's box. I've beaten my drill all to hell and back and it just keeps on keeping on."
1,Plagarist,"Much of this book was plagarized from Martin Amis's book the Rachel Papers, and the author has admitted he is a thief."
3,A good gossipy overview of Poulenc's life,"A much needed book, as there is no new biography of Poulenc in English or for that matter in French since the Henri Hell book of 1958, which was subsequently revised in the late 1970s. Ivry is much franker about Poulenc's private life than earlier writers as the publication of unexpurgated editions of Poulenc's letters allows this now. I could have done with some more relevant pictures: for instance there is a two page spread devoted to a picture of a ballet version of the Gloria, a curious choice. There is another book out there waiting to be written about this fascinating and contradictory character."
1,"Gossipy, yes. Good???","At last! We are in possession of a tawdry, rambling account of the life of this uniquely gifted composer. The unnecessary focus upon Poulenc's sexual orientation does little to aid the reader's understanding of the subject but perhaps betrays some unresolved issues in the author's psyche. More insightful musical analysis would have been welcome and a broader perspective requisite. I can only partially support the previous reviewer's comment that this is a ""good gossipy overview..."". Gossipy it IS, without question. Good? A good opportunity wasted."
2,smith corona wordsmith electric typewriter,We received it defective. The paper hold-down bar doesn't work and it is warped. We've E-mailed you twice to make a return and are seeking instructions on how to do it but no one from your company will respond back to us.
3,Great way to turn you PC into a DVR,"My laptop served as a DVR while I was working abroad by using this device. Cheap and easy to use, but won't handle HD recordings."
4,"Conveniant, but bad quality","It's nice to have because I can schedule a recording from any other computer over the internet, but the picture quality is pretty bad and is not what I expected from Hauppauge."
2,no audio,"when i use it with my dell inspiron 9300, only video moderate quality picture, but no audio. i can not find any software to correct it , if anybody has any idea let me know please"
1,Dont BUY! V.V.V.V.BAD,"(...) Nothing other than bunch of color dots came after installing per manual. Tried with so called updated drivers and software, but no luck.Do I have to tell you installation instruction on their website was such a mess? Better look for something else. Returned mine to store!"
1,Same old Hagee Hate and Fear Cash In,"John Hagee has made alot of Money on preaching about Hate and Fear, guess what? he is at it again. Hagee's very slanted view about terrorism is of course filled with all the fear he could get into this book. His own misguided ideas about terrorism, America and God are filled with his usual fire and brimstone the Boogey man is gonna get you nonsense that he sells so well, actually scaring people with fear of the Devil has made Hagee rich and doesn't look like Hagge has any problem stuffing it in. This man should be writting horror movies for Hollyweird, because he is another guy making a buck on sensationalism."
5,Reviews of the Book - or John Hagee?,"The book was excellent with many accurate facts, if reasearched historically and biblically.Why did so many opinions above deal with the writer's opinion of John Hagee and secondly the book? Ummmmmmmmmmm?Fundamentalism beliefs in general? Ummmmmmmmmmm?The book was an interesting read, well presented with many references to contemplate.Personally, I don't care about anyone's opinion on John Hagee! I'd rather read the publication and form my own opinion about it than hear some preconceived Hagee bashing.I'd ask why they bought the book in the first place. Was it with an open mind or simply to find fault with the beliefs the writer.Isn't freedon of religious belief one of our Constitutional rights?I didn't agree with everything written in The Profet Kahil Gibran, yet it was a book I'd recommend.Attack On America New York, Jerusalem, And The Role Of Terrorism In The Last Days is a great book - if read with the proper frame of mind.Buy it."
1,Nonsense,"I only rate this one star since it is required to proceed with the online review; if it wasn't required, I wouldn't even rate it that high. That the editorial review could refer to this [guy] as a ""respected Middle East scholar"" is to give new meaning to the term spurious scholarship. Hagee is a ... who despises pretty much anyone who doesn't take to his own warped view of Christianity, and anyone who is Jewish should be wary of what he really thinks about their role in prophecy and ""the end times."" He simply regurgitates his tossed salad of hypocrisy, racism and misinformation into one silly tome after another, and he offers nothing new in this particular screed aimed to make a buck off of last year's tragedy."
3,a tossup,"Let's see... spend eternity in heaven with the likes of Pastor Hagee, or spend it writhing in hellfire. Sounds like a tossup to me."
1,Horrible,"He hates everyone who isn't Jewsih or Christian. He lies, most likely from ignorance, about many things. For exampe he has the aggressivness to say that there are two versions of the Quran: One is English the other is Arabic. Of course it's a stupid statement made by a stupid person. He has no knowledge of the Palestinians and the history of the region. He doesn't talk about the ethnic cleansing that the Palestinian civilians (1,500,000 forced out of their homes) faced in 1948 and later and are still unable to go back to thier homes and land.One Last point that he avoids is the fact that Muslims are the decendants of Abraham as well. He mentions that the Jews and Christians and few Arabs are. But acoording to his logic (or lack of) Muslims too are decendants of Abraham. Yet he is hostile and racist to them."
1,Another book by a demagogue,"""Pastor"" Hagee has written another book on a subject in which he apparently has little factual knowledge but lots of passion and prejudice. His skewered reporting on the ""facts"" of the mid-east conflict are about as one-sided and bigoted as anything out there. It almost seems that there is a competition between fundamentalist Christian leaders in America like Hal Lindsey, Pat Robertson, etc as to who can spread more hate towards Muslims. This book is a predictable read and has been written many times before by the same author and other ""Christian"" pastors. I guess as long as it makes money and spreads hate and fear, these books will continue to be published."
3,Good conditioner but not the best,"I am always looking for a conditioner that will make my dyed and highlighted hair soft and shiny. This is not it. If you live in a dry climate and have processed hair, try Pureology Nanoworks.This is great for my 8 and 10 year olds hair but nothing special for me."
4,Best Conditioner Yet,"I have tried multiple conditioners on my thick coarse colored hair and this is the only one I have found that makes my hair soft.The scent is light and stays on your hair for a long time. I would highly recommend this product. My only gripe is the high price and sometimes I sneeze when I'm using it in the shower. I'm probably allergic or reacting to an ingredient in it, but I'll take the benefits over the mild reactions."
5,Within 2 days,"In 2 days my hair went from frizzy to smooth and shiny and soft, even with a cheap shampoo. I was really amazed. I just use a tiny bit and leave it on for about 5 minutes, then rinse out with cool water. Very amazing results that I did not expect."
4,"expensive, but worth it","Ever since I started bleaching my hair I swear by this stuff. It's a splurge by my standards, but I just scrimp on cheapo shampoo to offset the $$."
2,Orders Not Fulfilled As Advertised,"I ordered the 16.9 oz pump bottle of Terax Crema conditioner from seller Beauty Bazaar. I specifically ordered this item because of its packaging, size and pump dispenser. I opened my order to find two separate bottles of Terax Crema conditioner. These bottles have a new or different packaging style and, most importantly, NO PUMP DISPENSER. The contents of the two bottles add up to less than 16.9 oz. I got one 16 oz bottle and one 6.7 oz bottle. If I wanted two smaller squeeze bottles of this product in the new packaging I would have purchased two smaller squeeze bottles of this product in the new packaging.That said, I think the Terax product itself is wonderful. It smells great and conditions perfectly. I also love the original blue and pink packaging style."
5,RELIEVES TRESSES OF STRESSES,"An admitted Italophile I've long loved and admired many things Italian, whether it be the inimitable art, fine leather, incomparable olive oil, wonderful food or friendly people. Little surprise that a fabulous line of hair care products is also made in Italy.Imported from Bologna, Terax is based on the premise of restoring luster and natural beauty to hair by extensive hydration. For me the first step was Crema, a treatment conditioner that revitalizes hair and eliminates broken ends without weighing down.For most of us the best results are probably achieved by applying a small amount and leaving it on for about 3 minutes. If your hair is really dry and gasping, leave it on for about ten minutes and cover your head with a plastic cap.Really do believe you'll be amazed at the difference Crema can make."
2,Poor Conditioner,"I've tried many conditioners over the years. I thought the Terax Crema would be something special based on all the glowing reviews and company claims. I found none to be true. My hair actually started to become poorly textured and somewhat tangly while using this conditioner. It barely conditions. It certainly doesn't improve hair texture or condition. It smells nice- that's about the only positive thing that I can say about it. Many better conditioners out there, cheap and pricey."
2,nahhh,Not for my hair type!!! im a naturally curly girl and this product did no justice for my hair! maybe someone else without curls could use it!
2,inaccurate sound bytes about basic networking topics,"Buy this book if this sentence seems right to you, ""Process switching can be described as a router processor repackaging a frame after the frame has been processed. Process switching occurs when encapsulated frames are being sent across a WAN link. Encapsulation takes place in the router's processor, so when encapsulation is being used and switching is needd, process switching occurs."" Repackaging technical documentation should not be attempted by soneone who doesn't really understand what is going on. The book is full of pithy, slightly wrong statements."
5,Ditto on the CCDA recommendation ...,"Although a new CCDA exam (640-861) is now appearing, and the Cisco prodcut information is somewhat dated for the older CCDA exam (640-441), the foundations are great for both CCDA and eventual CCDP. I read this a year before taking up the CCNA and CCDA exams, and ended up referencing _back_ to it every time reading another book raised some questions.All-in-all, it's a great ""base reference"" for anything studying for Cisco exams."
2,Terrible Release!,"The only good thing about this release is that the tin LOOKS pretty cool. Aside from that, it is worthless. It doesn't include any of the booklets from the original platinum release and the tin just falls open. It's impossible to keep the DVDs closed inside, the tin doesn't shut properly and they fall out. Do not buy this garbage."
3,This is not a Bootleg. Gainax released their whole line like this.,"Unless Gainax is bootlegging their own stuff and selling it at best buy, this guy is retarded.Everything that needs be said, is said. Its the old Plats, nothing more. You get some decent extras. Thats about it."
5,Great Product,"Great product, all episodes but not the movies. If you get this, buy The end of evangelion, not death and rebirth."
1,"Up side down chapter, loose pages",Paid extra to get book next day through Amazon.com. Spiral edition has a chapter upside down and many of the pages are loose. Not what I expected for over $50.00. Never again!
5,Great book!,This book is very easy to learn from. The workbook style makes learning more interactive. The CD's are a great additional learning tool.
4,"Swing Piping Bound Photo Album, 3-up","I have several other photo albums from Swing and this one is the same great quality. However, I did order this in black and received a red one."
1,Horrors!,"Once again the string quartet butchers a brilliant artist with it's simplified arrangements and awful musicianship. If you want to hear versions Elliott's works do him justice check out Brad mehldau (bottle up and explode), Bill frisell (satellite), ir chris O'reilly's soon to be released tribute album."
1,No Thanks,"Normalmente los tributos tienden a hacer una diferencia o una mejora con los temas originales, los ejemplos sobran. Pero realmente sto pareciera ser un no-tributo, es como si una banda escolar fuera obligada a tocar temas que no les gustan, es realmente horrendo escuchar temas con tematicas y colores musicales hermosos como Waltz#2 destruídos por un supuesto ""homenaje"". No es la falta de las palabras lo que hace a este disco una verguenza, sino que es que no suena ni estimula nada... totalmente lo contrario de las versiones originales donde la sóla guitarra creaba una atmosfera increible.Realmente no se de donde salió esta ocurrencia, y lo digo así por que no se me ocurre palabra que mejor describa esto que ""ocurrencia"".Quedemosnos con el verdadero Elliott, tambien con algunos de sus temas ejecutados por Beck, pero esto... no gracias."
1,"Dysfunctional, fragile",Case is too soft - doesn't offer adequate protection for the toothbrush bristles when packed into a toilet bag. The cap is attached to the body with a very fragile plastic loop - I managed to snap it off accidentally trying to remove the price tag! Not a good toothbrush case....
1,Not a worthwhile use for your money,"Poor picture quality. No real information other than dreamy horoscope like explainations of the five animal forms. A very dated book that harkens back to America's early misguided fascination with imitation kung fu styles. Whatever form of Kung Fu this guy knows it doesn't look like Hung Gar, or Shaolin to me."
5,The Queen Who Couldn't Bake Gingerbread,Twenty-five years ago I read this book to the first graders where I was student teaching and we all loved it. I have been reading it to children (and adults) ever since because it illuminates the truth that we often SEEK relationships to fulfill our needs rather than to take care of them ourselves. This picture book makes it easier to talk about breaking gender stereotypes and becoming the person we were intended to be.It's also a HUGE hit because we always serve warm gingerbread to everyone while a musician visits to play the slide trombone.
5,Lucid and Engaging,"In this book, Taigen Leighton achieves something that I have rarely found (but am always searching for) in popular Buddhist literature: he matches objective scholarship and illuminating historical, sociological, and psychological observations with religious depth, insight, and sensitivity. In fact, his chapter on Avalokiteshvara and his discussion of Pure Land Buddhist traditions played a determinative role in my own spiritual unfolding. And like the skillful orator Manjushri's, Taigen Leighton own language is clarifying and incantatory at once. To enter into its serene rhythms is to taste something of the presence of the Bodhisattvas. A highly edifying read and radically Mahayana work that is precisely what is needed to lead us into the new millennium."
2,Wrong picture,"Please note that the picture for the 97043 and the 97042 are reversed. I was slightly irritated because the 97043 is also slightly wider in diameter. 8 3/8 diameter to be exact. The 97042 is 7 1/2 in diameter.Here is some necessary info on the 97042 should you need it.Double Circline Fluorescent Bulb40WG10q typeRated Life: 10000 HrsApprox Light: 2700 LumensInner diameter is 4 1/8"", Outer diameter is 7 5/8"""
2,expensive lamp,"I bought this ceiling fixture at Lowe's two years ago as kitchen,energy saving, light. Original bulb burned out after just two years while being advertised 5+ years bulb. Lowe's did not have replacement so I ordered trough Amazon. This is same bulb as original. It produces good light and I hope it will last much longer than original.This review is based on original bulb; to expensive for such short life span. I hope replacement will last much longer, otherwise I will replace fixture."
4,Wonder why it isn't white,"I am happy to have found this unusual light as it was not avaiable at any of the big box stores here in my city.I am happy to have a light in my kitchen, but wonder why it seems not to be white, more of a yellow color."
3,Didn't fit quite right,This was the first time I'd had to change this particular lamp. I took the old one to Home Depot and they didn't have any of the double type lamps. I ordered the new lamp through Amazon after finding the exact lamp I needed. When I recieved the lamp even though the numbers matched is was slightly larger and the clips on the fixture didn't hold the lamp in place very well.
2,Jay-us ex machina,"There are really fine moments in this book when Jennie and Jill struggle to work out a painful relationship and when Peter struggles to make up for his cowardly past. And there are nice descriptions of some of the pricier parts of New York City. But I find that the characters easily lapse into stereotypes. The situations, as portrayed, seem artificial. And the ending is contrived beyond belief.This could have been a serious character study of the pain and pitfalls experienced by a character suffering from low self-esteem who seems to have learned little from her prior experience. Instead, it's a cavil. I suspect that the author knows the difference between what's genuine and what's ersatz but, for some reason, has opted for the latter. I'd like to see her compose the sequel in which Jennie overcomes her fantasies of love and trades her mannequin for a man of some depth and character to be a stepfather to her lovely duaghter."
1,paper thin,"I had never read Belva Plain before but needed a quick read so I picked it up from the library. I felt the storyline to be thin, the characters lacked substance and were unbelievable. I was an older teen during the time this book took place and I promise you, no one I knew talked like the character in the book. I found myself frustrated with the main character as well as the situation she herself created."
5,The Best!,"After enjoying books written by Belva Plain for over 30 years, her name is enough to make me buy another book! She makes you 'feel' the story and be unhappy to see a book end. 'EVERGREEN"" was the first to start me reading a lot of books by Belva Plain."
3,Not Plain's best work,"I thought this book, Blessings, was a bit slow and boring. The characters were not very likeable, and the scenes jumped back and forth. I made myself finish it, and I did like the ending."
3,Poetic but not appealing,"All the Baroque four mighty -- Bach,Handel,Vivaldi and Telemann--are here to be played. The collections are poetic picks in terms of compositions. However, given these big 4 all in once, one can get a lots of liberty on picking the pieces and performance. And this particular packed are not something appealing. Nice to the eyes, but plain to the ears. May be a nice CD for claming baby's mood or for baby's bed time. Not a good idea for baby's playing time."
2,"Good music, terrible vocals.","I'm giving this CD 2 stars based ONLY on the music up to the last two tracks (where there's nothing to recommend at all). Why is it that so many electronica bands seem to think that singing consists solely of screaming without any discernable melody? I loved the music on most of the tracks, but then each track was ruined for me as soon as the vocals began. Hey, I can scream too...but it takes real talent to actually sing. I'm just glad I bought this used off Amazon and I'm only out about $7. I'll try to pawn this off on a co-worker, or resell it at Amazon. What a waste. Who cares if the words are good if they're screamed at the top of someone's lungs? This is NOT GOOD ELECTRONICA. I do know the difference--there are several good electronica bands out there (Juno Reactor, Apoptygma Berzerk, Afro-Celts to name but a few). I wish I had a way of isolating just the music..."
4,It's really small.... seriously.,"It's a great piece of engineering. I can't imagine stuff getting smaller, for the size it's a steal at the price that's being offered right now. The only drawback, and the reason I gave it only 4 instead of 5 is that it's a tad slow. Not a deal breaker for me though, I keep this in my wallet. I have a partition that is open that lets me boot XP OFF the stick, for devices that support USB bootable startup. The other partition is encrypted and uses a program called TrueCrypt, I store backups of personal data, bank info, etc. and it's all encrypted."
4,Among his best (sadly?),"I've listened to wumpscut for quite a while now, and, this is perhaps the one I throw back on the player the most, aside from EYF(which, despite my initial enthusiasm upon hearing it, has dissipated a bit for me.) The two ambient tracks that close this album are by far the best, and there is some extremely interesting, organic EBM contained as well. As this is a collection of his earlier works, there are some poor(and sometimes embarassing) slip-ups, but the quality of the strong songs outshines the poorer, more amateurish-sounding ones. I just find it a pity that Rudy did not continue on in the vein of his Mesner successes, but rather chose a downward spiral of awkwardly cheesy industro-goth cliches (BLOOD! DEATH! ad infinitum ad nauseum) I advise those who share my opinion on :W: to seek out the artists of the powernoise movement, which 'scut actually helped to propagate. Among them: Imminent Starvation, Converter, Noisex and Synapscape."
4,Holy Sh*t!,"This is amazing! I was turned on to Wumpscut just recently by a friend and now I am thinking, ""Why did it take so long."" This is the first thing I heard/bought and it blows my mind. Hearing this album shuffled with Front 242 ""Off"" is a combo made in hardcore heaven. They are the best thing to come around since 242. Get this!"
4,Good Collection of Rarities and Mixes,"So far only one reviewer has nailed this...This is a pretty good album but it is intended to be a way for fans to get rare early :W: tracks and remixes. It is NOT the proper place for new fans to start as it does not represent the band all that well. Better places to start would be 'Embryodead', 'Bunker Gate Seven' (or even better the original 'Bunkertor Sieben'), 'MFAST' or the double EP 'Dried Blood of Gomorrha'.Most of the tracks on Mesner are stripped down, simplistic electro that are somewhat aggressive but not nearly as much so as most :W: releases. The standout track is ""Mother"". If you like this song then you must get the Haujobb remix version avaliable on 'Remix Wars Part I - Haujobb v :Wumpscut:' - this is one of the best reworkings I've ever heard.Anyway it is a very good album but meant to complement his collection and not meant to be a starting point or standalone release."
1,Hapless WinTV-Radio (Model 401),"I got this as a Valentines Dat gift for my almost XYL. She said the needed drivers weren't on the CD & the so-called instructions were basically one sheet of paper.(her system: Windows XP Pro, Shuttle MN31N m/b, Athlon XP 2500, 512meg dual channel PC2700 RAM) So far she hasn't been able to get it to work. She called Hauppauge & they said it sounded like a hardware problem, but to try it on another computer. Right- she'll rush right out & buy a second computer.When she gets around to bringing the computer over, I'll try to get it working. I bought this card thinking Hauppauge was an old-line company with quality products. I'll reserve judgement until I can check it out myself, but as of now I'm still looking for a top-notch TV/FM card."
5,Way better than ATI TV Wonder,"I have purchased ATI TV cards for a long time, but I am glad I purchased the Hauppauge. I was having problems with the ATI cards freezing and havin audio synch problems. This card is awesome and I have had zero problems. Buy with confidence!!!!"
5,All Sold Out!,I loved this TV way back in the olden days when I had windows xp. I have vista now and the new Hauppauge tv sucks really bad. It gets so hot its a good thing its an external item or things could melt from the heat.
4,Johnnie's fourth Malaco album finds him in peak form.,"Released in 1988, ""In Control"" was Johnnie Taylor's fourth Malaco album. He may have been written off as a ""Has been"" by Urban Contemporary radio but he was still one of the finest and most powerful R&B singers around. It's shameful that this album (like most of his other Malaco titles) got almost no recognition."
5,The Real John F. Kennedy,"I really enjoyed reading this picture book. This book portrays JFK as a normal person who had real problems in his life. Dispite being one America's Great Presidents, people can see the other side of him as well. The everyday boy growing up in a big family. I learned what he did as a kid, and how sickly he was. This book even gave information about his brothers as well. The illustrations are incredible. The pictures are almost a perfect likeness of JFK and his family."
5,Excellent Backback,"This backpack is the perfect pack for 2-5 days of traveling. I purchased the Gregory Jade 50 for an upcoming trip to Peru and it was perfect for everything I needed to carry. Plenty of storage, compartments and lightweight. Highly recommended."
3,Dull Desert,"There are some compelling characters and issues in this play, but nothing very dramatic happens. They just hang out at the church waiting for the roads to open. It's good that it sheds light on issues of discrimination againts native americans and the lower class by making them work in uranium mines. The desert setting is cool, but it's mostly dull."
5,CHALLENGING AND FUN,"As a Director of Christian Education, I am always looking for new and relevant material. I found it in T. L. Lewis' FROM BOOTCAMP TO THE BATTLEFIELD. In fact, it is now a standard part of our Sunday School Curriculum. I highly recommend this book and the Leaders' Guide that goes along with it."
2,Interesting Concept is destroyed...,I hate to follow the majority here but I must admit this movie is horrible... from the flawed plot line to the terrible acting it is one of if not the worst films I saw in 2006.Being from Australia I saw it was being released soon in cinemas but it hadn't been out for a week and it was removed... So I decided I still wanted to see it so I bought the Uncut Directors Cut what awaited me was a horrendous mess of a film with poor picture quality and has also revealed to me just how terrible actors some of the core ensemble are.It is a terribly made movie but derived from an extremly interesting concept that could have turned out to be a far better film.Don't waste your time with this...
4,Thriller,"It was a good movie for Halloween night. The story line is non-believable, but if you like bloody scary movies, I think you'll like it."
3,It's watchable,"That's really the best to be said about this movie. It's something of a unique concept, a video game that kills people, but that's not enough to save it. The performances are somewhat questionable and some of the ""plotpoints"" seem to be there to serve as a throwaway excuse for the ending. The place this movie stands out seems to be the scenes in the game itself. It all looks well enough, however the plot is pretty thin and the deaths rather uninteresting. This film is definitely not something for everyone or even for most, but some people will find it decent enough. If you can suspend disbelief beyond the usual level and overlook some spotty writing, this is something to check out if it's below $5."
3,Rip off history to make a one dimensional ghost,"I liked the movie for what it was, a good popcorn movie.The only gripe I had about the movie was the fact that the writers ripped off the history of the hungarian countess Elizabeth Bathory the ""Blood Countess"".They got the tite of countess right and her pention for a bloody bouble baths and thats it. They put her in a diffrent time and completely diffrent continent. To make matters worse they only give you a hint of the history behind her as well as her motives. What your left with is a sketchy reason for her killings and a gothic looking ghost running around with a pair of sheers who has a thing for young girls.Pretty much you have to know Bathory's history to understand whats going on with the ghost."
1,an hour and a half of my life i'll never get back!!!,"i love the TRUE story about elizabeth bathory, the blood countess. this movie just plain sucked. it was cool that they placed the countess in the villain's spot, but her legend was fluffed to fit the story line. here's an idea: MAKE A MOVIE ABOUT HER REAL LIFE...NO LIES, JUST TELL HER LIFE'S STORY; IT WOULD BE FREAKY ENOUGH. thank you for your time >:-)"
3,That woman freaked me out!!!!!!,the movie was a good movie. but it wasn't a movie that i would see thousands of time. the only thing that i did like about the movie is that it was set in New Orleans. the woman in the movie freaked me out. i thought that the women in the movie was in my room. i barely could sleep for a couple of weeks. it is an alright movie if you like movies that is scary.
3,Stay Alive,"After the death of a friend, five twenty-somethings plug in to the cursed video game that killed him.Okay, so that sounds like a stupid premise. And yes, there are times the writing lives down to the genre's expectations. Yet, there's still something intriguing about the story, the mythology used to build it, and the ways in which the old school (ancient curse) and new school (video games) meet head on.Not Oscar-worthy, but not a bad waste of a few hours, either."
3,Stay With It,"I am not a huge fan of this type movie, but as far as the genre goes I thought this was pretty good. Better than Saw II in my book. At least it had a suspenseful story and not just lots of people being hacked up. There certainly is some of that, but it is well dispensed within a story of some computer gamers getting caught up in a game that kills people. the cops don't believe their story until one of their own plays the game. Now if you are a computer gamer like myself it may help you appreciate it, but I thought as a thriller it also did well setting the story and atmosphere for non-gamers as well. I recommend you at least rent this and give it a chance."
2,Rewriting History,"I didn't have much hope for this movie, but it sounded fun, so we went and watched it. It was okay (not brilliant or anything)... Until the meeting of the villian. The writers of this movie have displaced the story of Elizabeth Bathory (aka the Female Dracula). From that point, I was unable to enjoy it. If they had changed her name instead of rewriting her story, it would have remained an okay movie."
1,there's stuff that sucks then there's this movie,"I wasn't expecting much when this movie came out in theaters..so i had very low expectations. However, this movie was so horrorible, that I was still disappointed. I figured maybe there'd be at least one creative death scene...NOPE....maybe a few topless women .....NOPE there's utterly NOTHING good about this movie.."
2,What the hell?,"This wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be. It had some decent creepy scenes and the acting, while not stellar, wasn't as bad as the typical horror movie.The part that really ruined the movie for me was the butchering of the story of Countess Bathory. Why not create a fictional legend set in New Orleans to center the movie around? Doing so would have made a much better plot. I know many horror movies don't make much sense, but really, it could have been decent if the writers had put a little more effort into the storyline. What's next - a movie in which Vlad the Impaler has relocated to Texas, opened a ranch, and has been sucking the local cattle dry?"
3,copied nightmare on elm street,This movie basically flat out copied the Nightmare on Elm Street movies. If u die in your dreams you die in real life. The Nightmare films were far superior. This is a stupid retarded bubble gum teeny booper horror flick. God! They don't make horror movies like they used too.
2,Dont See It!,"The problem with this scary movie is that it isnt scary at all. Arent horror supposed to be scary, or do i have the entire point of them wrong? A good movie for people who dont have the guts to see a REAL horror movie, like Saw. Dont waste your money. The only reason it gets 4 stars is because its funny some times."
1,WHY DIDN'T FRANKIE DIE?!,"The only part of the movie that had me interested is waiting for Frankie Muniez to die...which he didn't! Okay, number one if you really wanna be scared by a video game go down your basement, turn all the lights off and play fatal frame. That will have you pissing in your pants, screaming and scared to ever go near video game systems again. Okay, yeah I laughed but I was laughing at how horrible and corny this movie was. I wasn't even scared and folks, I am a huge baby. I was scarred for life when I saw the grudge. And I am even horrified of chuckie. But if this didn't really scare me then I wouldn't even bother to see it if you're looking for a fright. For once I actually agree with the critics for giving this movie an outstanding one star. Congralutions! Next time just film Frankie's bad acting for the whole movie and that maybe will be a little scarier."
2,Okay....,"This movie had a lot of potential, but it falls short. It centers around a group of teens who realize that the video game they've inherited is possessed, and if they die in the game they die in real life. The basic problem with this movie is it doesn't even have a real good plot. I mean, it is a horror movie, but it's only pg-13. There wasn't even that much gore, so you need something to keep you entertained. But since there's no mention of how the game was made or who made it you leave the movie wondering ""What was the point of watching that?"" And the ending? A total rip-off of The Ring. The only creepy thing about the movie is The Blood Countess, because she was actually a real person who killed over 600 girls in her lifetime. So I'm sorry to say that ""Stay Alive"" could barely keep me to stay awake."
5,I thought it was sick!!,"I really enjoyed this movie. When I saw it in the theaters and when I bought it. It had everything I like in a movie of this type! I can't wait for the sequel. If there is one. And the way it ended it sure looks like there will be one to me. In case there is confussion with the title, I mean sick, in a good way!"
3,Great back pack with one major flaw,"I just bought this to replace a notebook back pack I have had for 8 years. I like that tis is a lot lighter and more stylish, but there is a flaw that really annoys me, a lot. I do not pick up the back pack, swing it over the center of my back and then insert both arms into the straps to use to shoulders and my back to carry it. I tend to fling one side of it over one shoulder only and walk from my car to the coffee shop or work, or back to the car. My last back pack had a rubberish underside to the straps, so they sort of gripped my shoulder, keeping it sort of in place. This back pack has a mesh like material that does not grip at all, in fact seems to glide rght off like teflon. So I put it over my shoulder and walk no more than 5 steps and it had slid off my shoulder onto my arm, which is annoying and if carrying coffee, causes it to spill. If only the unit had a non-slip material on the underside of the straps it would be perfect."
2,too big,I bought this backpack for my daughter to use riding the DC metro to and from work. It was really too big for her and looked more like a piece of luggage. We had to return it and find something slimmer and more professional looking.
5,Great Book for all ages!,"I highly recommend this book to anyone who has kids! My son is 4 and absolutely loves Charlie & Lola. Actually, of all the cartoons that I have to watch during the day, it's one of my favorites also. My son will start Pre-K in September and I think this helps prepare him a little. Lola is so funny and this book is another great Charlie & Lola story."
5,nice little cuff,Im not sure how this would work for actual patient use as I bought it for my daughter's veterenarian play kit. It does function fully.
2,Horrible smell,"I purchased this with the intention of putting it in a doctor kit I'm making for my children for Christmas. I received it today and out of the box it has a terrible odor; similar to an item kept in moth balls, but way more intense. I don't even want to take it out and touch it to see if it works. I'm going to try to air it out on the deck for a few days and see if it helps. I can't give this to my children like this. I'm dissapointed because this was recommended on a blog which is why I chose it. There were others that were less expensive and some that even included a stethoscope."
4,Fun Toy,"This ring looks cheaply made, but it's actually pretty sturdy. It's also kind of small in size, for your finger. The ring itself is rather large. There is some tiny piece of metal inside the ring that limits it's size. It was a fun gift for my brother for Christmas. He thoroughly enjoyed it."
1,It didn't work,"The ring never lighted up, even It got fixed by two diferent people, didn't work. Snif :(. I would've returned it but I don't live in the states, so that wasn't possible. But it arrived very fast, sorry didn't work"
1,See it for what it is.,"Despite the photo, which is the arm of a fully grown man sporting this metal S-shield, the moment you try to put it on you realize it wasn't made for an adult hand. It barely fit on my pinky, and my hand is far from what's considered to be large. The light itself isn't very bright, blinks sharply and repeatedly for a short amount of time, and is abnormally heavy. More to the point, it's hard to see whether or not this is a toy at all. It's overall design doesn't seem to really fit what's appropriate for a child, but it's certainly not sized for an adult. In short, the ring doesn't really know what it is, and it's hard for buyers to figure out who it goes for."
3,So Pretty! 3 1/2 STARS,"This album is one of the prettiest things i've have ever been privilaged to hear. Tony and Bill Evans make you want to cry the songs are done wonderful and bill evens arranging is a masterpiece the only thing I didn't like was on some of the tunes Tony was singing WAY TO LOUD and over powering the piano. My favorite track on this album is ""You Must Believe In Spring"" Tony sings just right and Bill Evans plays [great]. I like this album alot and Iam telling anyone who Likes Tony Bennett or JAZZ to pick up this masterpiece."
5,See Below,"Looking at my review, I notice there are some horrid typos on it. Is there a way to correct them?Howard Wexler wexmary@mindspring.com"
3,Better than the First!,"Bill Evans almost never recorded with a vocalist. But he and Tony Bennett admired each others work, so they wanted to record.Due to contractual problems, they performed ""Together"" & ""Together Again"" at the same time. ""Together"" was released by Bill's label and ""Together Again"" was released by Tony's.""Together"" been available for years but ""Together Again"" was not.Superb Jazz vocals. Better selection, better recording than the first! Where has this been hiding?Tony Bennett uses his voice like a musical instrument."
1,Excellent Documentary on Defective Discs,"It is unfortunate that this most excellent documentary seems to have been taped on, what appears to be, faulty discs. The movie freeze-frames towards the end of the presentation. The original version of this film did the same thing. I played the discs on two different DVD's. It did the same thing on both machines. None of my other DVD's do this; only these two documentaries. Therefore, I would advise potential customers to be aware of this problem when considering their purchases.It is such a shame! Because this is one of the best documentaries on the subject I have ever seen."
2,Front hitch,Installation instructions poor and incorrect. When installation complete the product not useable as it is about 2 1/2 inches aft of the bumper/plastic facia.There is no way a stanard stinger will reach that far to get the pin installed. The remedy is to buy a 7 or 8 inch extension so your into the deal another 30 to 35 dollars. Your actual weight capacity is reduced because of this condition. Curt tech services not much help.
5,AirPlay Boost,"This is the best trnsmitter on the market. The only one that will work most of the time because it will transmit on 87.9. Most others will not go that low, so there is too much interference. Too bad they are hard to find. They must have stopped making them for some reason."
1,I wouldn't recommend this product.,"This product gives you more static that anything else. It doesn't give you a lot of FM channels to choose from, but when you have it on the channel that has no frequency, you hear the static more than the music from your IPOD."
3,Just OKAY,I might have been impressed with this if I had not first used the Griffin iTrip (that plugged into the top of my old iPod). I purchased this to go with my new iPod Classic because my old iTrip couldn't be used with the new one. I decided on this one because I can use it while I'm charging the iPod (using the A/C charger). With the antenna on the side it does not plug into my Bose docking station (even with the insert for the Bose removed). It seems you need to keep the iPod pretty close to the radio for good reception. I wish they made iTrips like the old ones that plug into the top for the new Classic iPods!!!!!!!
5,"A very well written and powerful defense of absolute truth,","LaGard Smith exposes the folly of the New Age philosophy in an exciting romantic story. His material is scholarly, reverent, Biblical and kind. Smith writes like the lawyer that he is. His analytic mind, so useful in argumentation, has a tenderness as if kissed by Jesus. Great book! I could hardly put it down."
3,chair purchase,Ordered two chairs and recieved them on time. They are nice chairs but had too many finish flaws on them . I hade to repaint both chairs.
4,good book,i rarely read books that are old but i liked this book it was really interesting Julian and Lilith were really good characters both independent but still able to honestly express emotion. i think this was Loretta chase best book.
3,Knaves Wager,Half way thru the book and waiting for something -anything to pick up this book . I'm reading a second book but will get back to finish .--jt.
3,"It's good, but the edition...","I was glad to see that they've brought Ms. Chase's back catalog on to the Kindle. She's one of my favorites.And overall, I enjoyed the story and the characters: the leads were interesting, the supporting characters were very well drawn, and it was a quick, enjoyable read.The Kindle edition, however, has a whole lot of typos. Jarring ones. Usually I could get the correct word from context, but not always. And there were some narrative jumps towards the end that confused the heck out of me: Not sure if they were poor storytelling, or the edition itself.So... yeah. If you like Loretta Chase, you'll probably enjoy the book. But you also may be driven to some creative cursing by the edition."
3,Knave's Wager,"I liked this book well enough,but felt it was a little lavking in depth. Recommend as a way to pass an hour or so."
3,Not one of her best,"So, I enjoyed this story it was good, however I found it 'lacking' and kinda predictable. I love a lot of here other novels unfortunately I fond this one near the bottom of my list."
2,Disappointing!,"Lord of Scoundrels is one of my favourite books of all time. Apart from The Last Hellion, I have not found any of Ms Chase's books to come close to it. The story of Knave's wager sounded good but I was disappointed on reading it. The language was stilted and I would have loved more romance between the H and h. The story idea was great but it could have been written better."
3,not my fave,I like LC as an author but this was not one of my favorites. Our repressed heroine stubbornly and annoyingly holds onto her bitterness caused by her ex for most of the book. Our hero whose Rep is worse than his character is much more likeable as a character.
2,unpleasant,"I like the other books of Loretta Chase's that I've read, but I found this unpleasant. I returned it half way through.It starts out setting an interesting plot possibility, but then instead of going on with it, we're wading through page after page of a rather nasty sort of male protagonist hunting a woman to win a wager and damaging her reputation. He needs a good kick in a vulnerable area.Meanwhile, the potentiality interesting plot goes nowhere.Perhaps this was an early book of hers. If so, her writing has improved a lot in later books."
3,Another good start,"A nice plot with characters that interact well, develope/grow and make choices about their lives. That being said, it's an OK story. The other reviewers can give you a basic plot summary. As I wrote in my Devil's Deliliah review, my reason for reading this book is because I like her newer books, and want to see how her earlier stories match up. Lord of Scoundrels, Last Hellion and Captives of the Night, in that order, are the ones I like best. Didn't like Lion's Daughter."
4,Good copy of older regency romance,It was nice to find a copy of this older book. The book arrived exactly as advertised. I enjoyed reading the book on paper instead of electronically.
3,Just OK,Love Loretta Chase but not this story. It was just OK. Couldn't get into it or feel the love. Will continue to buy Loretta's books. No author can always hit the mark?
3,Friendships,"This book is very Christian based, which I did not know when I bought it. The author defines friendships (Aquaintance, causual friends, close friends, to best friends) and the characteristics/ intimacy of each. There are many biblical examples and tends to focus on aiming relationships toward ""the Jesus way"". Some good info to learn; realized that history shows how dymanic friendships can be."
5,"""Taking Offense"" and Giving It Away","Jeff Wickwire's book came at just the right time: I had just taught a class on the book ""Total Forgiveness"" by R.T. Kendall, and received a hurt from a pastor and a church where I was employed. Wickwire, a minister himself, spoke helpfully in his book to my pain and helped me to move along to recovery. Giving and receiving forgiveness is so important to living the Christian life and most of us endure slights and hurts and offenses from others all the time--and all too often hang on to them and poison our lives. Dr. Wickwire's book is interestingly written, helpful in everyday life, gives solid advice, and is positive and optimistic in how we are to live our lives in the face of unresolved hurts. The chapter on ""Choices"" is especially useful. As he writes, ""nothing you have suffered through yesterday is worth losing today and all your tomorrows!"" (page 109)"
5,a remarkable read!,"The life & times of the men & wives of a forgotten amphibious force of landing vessels serving in the Pacific during WWII.Within the covers of this unassuming, modest saga, you will meet brave & true ordinary men as they serve their country in extra-ordinary times. You will read of their recruitment & maneuvers, their frustrations & heroism, their terrors & poetry. You will see patriotism in action, gruff & ready, tender & determined.THE SANDSCRAPERS is a unique addition to any military library!"
5,SOME OF SONDHEIM'S BEST,"this is great stuff. I'm a huge Sondheim fan and this only increased it. If you enjoy showtunes, this is a must have"
3,"A Complete(?) Recording of Sondheim's ""Follies""","This CD is supposedly a recording of the complete music (including songs ""cut"" from the original) from the legendary Broadway Musical ""Follies"" in its recent reincarnation at the Paper Mill Playhouse in Milburn, NJ. In actuality, it is missing a couple ""cut"" songs but it's a good record of almost all the music - songs and dance music. Quality of recording - fair to good. Singers come a little too forward in the tracks. Some songs lack energy, both in pacing and performance. But the recording of Ann Miller singing ""I'm Still Here"" is an instant classic - worth the price of the CD. Nothing amazing here but for collectors, it's a must as the Original Broadway Cast (Capitol Records) was massacred in cutting."
4,Follies Follies Follies and even MORE Follies,"Well I would like to say hi to the person from Tulsa, Oklahoma and He ROCKS you know who this is. Anyway I LOVE this musical by Mr. Sondheim I also Liked Company too. Kaye Ballard did an EXCELLENT job. This is one I think in over all one of THE BEST recordings sense the Carol Bernette cast. Mr Sondheim is A genius and a wonderful composer And a great music writer. I personally liked "" Losing my Mind "" "" Waiting for the girls up stairs "" In Buddy's Eyes "" "" Broadway baby "" "" I'm still here "" and last BUT definetly not last "" Could I leave you? ""In buddy's Eyes was a very touching song to me. One of the London songs that were not on this recording was a great one was "" A country house "" that was a Kind of funny one and it was not also. I would like to leave everyone with a little phrase: ( I qoute my friend the Tulsa person. ) Sondheim Rocks and rulz!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,pretty but,"it is very nice but the pictures shows more than just the hook , so i was upset and it looks rubbed too much kind of tacky"
2,Not great,I thought this iron was going to be great but unfortunately it doesn't hold I used it at night and the next day it was flat the wave hadn't held so I was disappointed because I had one when I was younger and it held for weeks.
5,Best Waver I Know,"So far, I have tried four different kind of wavers and of the four (Bed Head, Revlon, Hot Tools, and the Infinit Conair), this one is by far the best one!! The plates produce deep big waves and the tourmaline plates make your hair look shiny. It's a little pricey compared to the one from Revlon, but worth every penny since it saves you so much time. The other wavers that I've tried are bulky and take forever to ""wave"" your hair, but this one is light, easy to hold, and gets nice waves in a short time. It also looks nice and NOT cheap like some of the other wavers."
3,An ok flat iron,"This flat iron creates nice size waves, however frizzes my hair. I used it on my daughters hair and she also had the same frizz effect. A plus is the iron heats up nicely and it doesn't take long to wave my hair. A negative is the location and sensitivity of the on/off button. It bugs me because as I'm waving my hair I accidently hit the button and it turns off, so I have to turn it back on and reset it back to my high setting. Overall it is an average wave iron."
5,Great Iron,I ordered this Iron and it works great! I've gotten so many compliments on my hair since i bought it. Good buy!
3,Product or Skill,"I used to be a Cosmelogist so I am skilled at using various hair tools. I have tried several ""wave irons"" and I not found one that waves instead of crimps. I have tried different section sizes, heat levels, etc. and haven't had the results I hope for. This product is a quality product, I personally just couldn't get it to do a wave."
2,Thick hair beware...,"I was really excited to see all that great reviews on this but really I shouldn't have expected it to work for me. My hair is thick and I have a hard time straightening it. My hair doesn't hold curl at all. If it wasn't so thick, then it might. I thought the waver might work for me but no. My hair waved a little at the top but that's all. Sorry to say, I'm sending it back."
1,IM FROM TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO AND THIS IS ONE OF THE WOST HOT SAUSE I EVER HAD THERE SO MUCH BETTER ONE IN TRINIDAD,IM FROM TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO AND THIS IS ONE OF THE WOST HOT SAUSE I EVER HAD THERE SO MUCH BETTER ONE IN TRINIDAD IT NOT EVEN TASTY LIKE THE OTHERS IF FULL OF FOOD STARCH .. IT NOT EVEN THAT HOT
2,Body Wrap Underwire Long Leg Bodysuit Shapewear,"It is comfortable, but it has no holding power. After only having worn it twice, my fingernail went straight through the material leaving a huge hole when I attempted to pull it up. I am very very disappointed. (I would have been more disappointed had it actually worked-shaped/and or smoothed....as it was, I am just disappointed I spent the money on it.)"
5,Like a glove,"Excellent quality leather and molded to precisely fit my .357 Ruger SP101 with 3 1/4"" barrel. The more I carry, the more the leather molds to the gun and to me. Love it!"
4,Shadow II Holster,"This is a very nice holster, with good fit and finish. HIst my SP 101 with a 3 inch barrel very well, snug, but not too tight. The thumb snap was difficult to snap at first, but is loosening with use as expected. Good product at a reasonable price."
5,Nice piece of cable for the price,"I have this adapter hooked up to my subwoofer. It does a good job of splitting the signal from my receiver into two channels. My subwoofer manual highly recommends doing this to keep the sub active. It has auto shut off. I like it, and at the time thought it was the best I was going to get in terms of an adapter. It is after all, Audioquest. I am not going to say my sub sounds better because of this cable. I will say it doesn't have any negative effect on the sound. I am thinking of replacing it with a more expensive model I found somewhere else. But that doesn't mean I am not happy with this adapter. I am happy with it. It is good quality build and design. What more can I say? For this price it is a steal."
5,Does what it says on the box,"I had a mammoth task of converting old VHS tapes into mpeg, and needed a way of splitting the VHS left-only mono output into a left and right output.After some minor online searching I came across this pretty sweet splitter.Works like a charm.Anyone that owns ""Easy VHS to DVD"" you will need one of these if you're transferring old mono VHS tapes."
5,"Easy to Install, Increased the sound of my Sub","I purchased this for use with my Velodyne Mini subwoofer. It definitely increased the quality of sound. I have another Velodyne that is using a Monster cable and the sound is comparable. At the end of the day, the price is affordable and the sound is great. You can't go wrong."
5,perfect addition to split audio feeds,I've used the AudioQuest splitter to split my audio feed from my TIVO to my TV based on the input's selected. This has helped me and the WAF!
2,Garbage,Lousy quality not compatable w/Vista drivers actually screwed up my registry. Lousy support seller wouldn't allow a return. It does make a lovely paperweight tho.
5,Canon Flask Sync Cable,This product does everything it says it does. I recommend it more for hand held or L-bracket use. The cable length is pretty short...like 2-3 feet MAX. The cable is very strong...I can tell it will last me a long while.
2,Worked great... for a year,"Worked great at first, did it's job and appeared to be well built. However after only a year, the hot shoe for the flash suddenly broke off. There was no warning or indication that it was getting loose. It was fine one day, and then it suddenly fell after attaching the flash."
1,Cheap plastic bracket,"will break with the weight of your flash - with any sudden movement, just not worth the cost - better off buying radio remote"
2,Broke surprisingly easily!,"The attachment to the hot shoe breaks very easily. Mine broke during a wedding shoot while using it for the first time. There was some user error on my part in that the camera and flash bracket fell from a chair onto the floor (I was tethered to my battery pack and forgot about that when I set my camera down and started to walk away). But the EC-03 broke surprisingly easily. There needs to be some kind of stronger material used to prevent the plastic from cracking in half as these units are on the expensive side. They should be made better, especially given that so many have had their break."
5,Good but short,"Useful item, does what it's supposed to. Only wish the cord was longer by maybe six inches for more versatility. In any case very satisfied customer here."
3,weak construction,"I just put my flash bracket down and this shoe just snapped off. The part that connects to the flash is made of plastic and couldn't take being put down roughly on a couch. I noticed that other much cheaper models make this part out of steel, for example: <...>"
4,"Typical Canon: Well built, but pricy","By now, I shouldn't be surprised that Canon's accessories are a bit expensive. I mean, $70 for a cable to take my 580EX II off of the hotshoe?The cord performs flawlessly. It's a well crafted and well-built piece of equipment, and doesn't have that flimsy feel that my off-brand (and half the cost) shoe cord had before it frayed and fell apart. The connection between my camera and flash feels rock solid.The cable stretches to about 2 feet, and fits fine on a flash bracket.Overall I'm happy with this thus far. Yes, it's expensive, but it feels sturdy enough to take years of abuse."
5,Improves casual photos immensely,Using this product with my Canon 580ex and a flip flash bracket greatly improves the casual photos that I have taken. By using the flip flash braket I can always keep the flash vertically over the lens so that all shadows from the flash fall behind the people I am shooting instead of to the left or right.I highly recommend this setup for people who take casual photos at any sort of group function.
3,Too Short,"Work well as described...but, why is it so short? It can not be place more that a foot from the camera unless you have something/one to hold it. And even then, you just might get it 2.5 feet away. This would be so much better if was was 10 feet or so. But at least it does allow you to get some angling."
2,Great until it breaks.,"Got it for the weather sealing, and it worked great and felt nice and solid up until the day it spontaneously split in half. On the bright side, the OC-E3 and battery pack cords saved the flash from hitting the ground, but that's hardly a recommendation.Unlike other posters here, mine took almost a year to fall apart, but that's with irregular use. I gave it the 2nd star just for the weather sealing.If you get this, carry a spare."
1,"Works well, terrible durability.","Not a whole lot to say here. Does what it's supposed to do, and it does it well, however just like the previous model suffers from terrible durability problem. There is no point of manufacturing a ""magnesium alloy body camera"" which takes a whole lot of beating and pairing it with this fickle accessory. I am tempted to use the term ""cheaply made"", but it's not. It actually looks and feels like a Canon product. After only a couple of uses though it starts falling apart and you no longer have communication with your flash - it will either not fire at all or blast at full fire.Not suitable for a working professional.And to add insult to injury, Canon does not offer any warranty on this. The statement I got from their Canon Professional Services rep was ""Canon does not offer any warranty on our accessories"".Shame on you, Canon!"
1,BEWARE! Off-Camera Shoe Cord OC-E3 Made in China quality,"I had Canon's old Off-Camera Shoe Cord for 35mm EOS for 25 years. Was made in Japan, had detachable components, was of high quality, and had no problems with it. The new OC-E3 is made in China (proudly stated in bold letters right on the top), has an integrated construction so that if any single component fails, the entire unit must be thrown out, has no warranty from Canon (""accessories have no warranty"" according to the spokesperson ""Marvin"" from Canon), and is made of polycarbonate material that cannot handle the weight of the heavier Canon flashes like the 580EX-II. Titling the camera sideways (while taking a vertical ""portrait"" style photo) can stress the flimsy flanges and cause them to crack or break. Canon's response is ""buy a new one."" You are better off looking for 3rd party attachments with better construction."
1,It will break. It can't handle the weight of the 580 Ex II,"Broke within 5 minutes of use. Split right down the middle and sent my flash tumbling. Completely useless. DO NOT BUY.Update: Canon is refusing to replace the cord stating: ""please note The warranty does not cover physical or accidental damage.""Update: After escalating to a supervisor at Canon they agreed to make an _exception_ and replaced the OC-E3 with a new one. Their default stance is physical damage is not covered. Unless you're willing to reinforce the OC-E3 in some way I wouldn't recommend trusting it with an expensive flash.Update: The replacement OC-E3 came. I disassembled it immediately, with the idea of filing it with epoxy to reinforce it, and discovered that one of the plastic posts was already broken."
1,Very Fragile,"I can't believe this thing breaks as easily as it does! I just started professionally shooting events with a D1s owned by my company. This thing has broken on me 2 out of 2 times using it. The sockets that the screws go into are made out of 1mm thick plastic! I have just rigged one with superglue, but haven't tested it yet. It will probably last longer than the screws did."
1,Not what I expected....,"Hey, what better than to get the book from Bashar's site itself? WRONG! What a mess! Exasperated with the lack of communication, lack of books, and service, I asked for a refund, only to be met with rude, martyr attitude, what a difficult company!I WAS a big fan till I dealt with the company directly. Glad I did, I do recommend caution, keep records of your emails and orders, or better yet...try someone else. It's not worth the hassle to deal with Bashar Communications."
5,good book,"This is a very good book. I learned a lot from it. I'm not sure who or what Bashar is, but they seem to be really fascinated with life here on Earth."
5,Possibly the most important book of our time,Those who have reached this place in our mental evolution will realize the importance of this book. It is a manual for creating and experiencing a life that is beyond all our past expectations. It explains in detail all you need to know tobecome all you desire to be.
2,A Disappointing Read,"If You Were A Ballet Dancer is not one of the better books about ballet for children. The book does an adequate job of introducing basic terms and information but is lacking in the details that make other books of this genre so interesting. Perhaps it would fare better with 4-8 year olds, rather than the 9-12 that it is intended for. The brightest spot of the book are the wonderful photographs, particularly in the middle of the book where they show scenes from different ballets."
2,Goopy,"I love the Glo foundation (matt), the best among all but this concealer defines my lines around the eyes. If you don't have much wrinkle, it is probably ok but I don't recommend on to people who have even fine lines."
4,Good Stuff,This is a very good concealer and feels great too - very smooth & blendable. I am used to concealer in a tube so still getting used to this type of concealer but overall like. I really love glo mineral products!
4,Useful for many purposes,"I bought one of these for my son to keep his important papers in, since he is frequently on the go. We ended up buying two more: one for my husband, who works in various locations; and one for me, to carry my punches for scrapbooking crops. It would be ideal if it came in other colors or if the case did not slip off of the box so easily, but it is very handy for a variety of things!"
1,Do not buy it!,"I have a somewhat bizarre story. I saw the product on their website, and called early this year (2004) about it. I was told it wasn't going to be available for a couple of months. I thought that meant it was a brand new card. I guess it only meant that it was out of stock. So, I called back a few months later, and was told it was available then, so I bought it. I had a lot of problems with it, but I was thinking I got a brand new card and therefore I just needed to wait for them to get the software ironed out. So, I've been checking their site, waiting for updated software and never found any.Now I find out the card is discontinued. Rather than getting one of the first ones, I now see that I got one of the last dregs. And as such, there is no support for it. Boy was I taken."
3,Good but inconsistent,"Many Project Pitchfork songs have a strange subversive quality about them. Perhaps it is the repeated chorus verses and German accents. AO is a pretty good disc; the title track is quite excellent and the reason I picked this up. There are some other good tracks on this album, but most of the songs are pretty simplistic. I would not call them a Skinny Puppy wannabe band at all. They are much more dance oriented and don't use many movie samples or anything like that. This is good club music... and it grows on you a lot! (Well, it grew on me! ;-)"
1,Another Wanna-Be Skinny Puppy,"There are about 1000 bands ou there that think they can make a living by sounding exactly like Skinny Puppy. It's a real shame that instead of being inspired by that great band, and going forward and creating new, fresh music, this band just keeps going in circles over other peoples old footsteps."
3,Document Scanner,"I do not recommend purchasing this brand. The support is not good. The hardware is not of high quality: the auto-feeder is constantly jamming paper. Due to problem, I purchase another mlti-function scanner/printer from office depot (no endorsement for office depot) at similar price range 6 months ago and works so far."
1,"Terribly written, skip it.","It was a real struggle to get through this. The plot was totally hollywood cliche. It was less about vampires and more a trash plot. But worse was the writing, it's just plain terrible with cliches numbering in the millions. Really, not worth it. I looked at the second, and just couldn't bear to continue the story so I moved on to other authors."
3,"I think the title was a good choice, but -","the story leaves a lot to be desired because it doesn't really explain enough as to character plot or assingnation, it doesn't go as deep as Anne Rice's Interview with the Vampire because it doesn't explain DeVilbisses background enough or the reasons as to why he wants to destroy the scrolls and what the scrolls would do to him and what is that strange part about the voices that control him, who is the secret society that is giving him the elixer that is keeping him alive? And the part as to where Simon Penn has something missing from his character to where he investigates DeVilbiss in the first place, what motivates these characters."
2,The Worse Vampire Book Ever!!!,"I tried to finish this book, wanting to escape from the Anne Rice serials for a fresh outlook on my favorite mythos creature.Yet what I found was this garbage I can't believe I wasted a day reading half way through. The author makes an attempt to mix subtle elements of Lovecraft's Cthulu mythos, with character archetypes from that semi-awful book I,Vampire into one crappy story in which the vampire can walk around during the day and eat burgers and fries. There is also a wimpy male character whose goals are petty and annoying and a female character whose dapplings in the occult are somewhat meaningless to the already silly plot."
5,A good mix,"This old album of leon Gieco is a very good example of what he is able to do: latin rock and folklorical music, the whole thing with the best argentin touch. A good piece of work to discover Leon Gieco very own work and understand better is work with people like Mercedes Sosa on one hand and Charly Garcia the best Argentin rocker on another."
1,I dunno,"This product eventually turns brown. That's all it seems to do. Maybe it removes phosphate, but I have no tool to measure if it does or not. As for helping control of get rid of algae (presumably through lowering phosphate levels)...NOPE! Made no impact on my tanks what-so-ever."
1,Waste of money!!!!!!,"I trusted seachem brand but this stuff didnt do anything at all! Im using this product for 4 days now and My green/hair algae still growing! I have ro/di water filtration, chaeto on my sump, reef octopus skimmer, 2 reactors npx biopellets and brs gfo, 48"" marineland led light and my light is on from 11am to 7pm ! I even bought seachem prime and 2 100ml seachem purigen! Save your money on this one!"
2,B3 Sure shot,This rifle is overall not great. It does not have a safety but the good news is that it doesn't shoot very hard. It may be all right for shooting tin cans but not much more.
1,con artist,"Like the other review said, this is the identical gun sold by cummings or toolsnow for 24 dollars. Look for the other pellet rifle if considering."
2,Good hook; would change the position of the screws,The hooks are nice but while installing with a cordless drill the lower screw hole was in an awkward place. The bottom part of the hook prevented the drill going straight in. The screw had to be put on at an angle causing it not to be flush. I was not concerned with looks for this application but if this were going to be visible I would like the screw holes to be straight across from one another so the screws could be inserted straight.
4,finding new music,"It was hard for me to take out the normal cds i keep stashed in my cd player, but when i gave this groovie ghoulies cd a spin i found myself singing to a new tune. this cd rocks..it lives up to the ghoulie expectations i set with their other cds..buy it youll like it"

2,impractical -too technical,This book is way too technical for the average photographer looking to get started using infrared film. Too many charts that only confuse and don't translate to in the field shooting. The images are also poorly composed and not creative. A waste of money.
2,Semi-useful text,"Okay, the book provided me with some tips on how to do things, as well as a little information, but on the whole, I have to agree with others that it was a little too technical for the average user."
1,"NO, NO,NO -TOO MANY ERRORS AND MISINFORMATION","Masquerading as a text on correctly using infrared, I found this book very poorly written, loaded with errors and containing amatuerish photographs. I felt ripped off. I will look for better written books on the subject. If I could have looked the book over ahead of time, I never would have purchased it."
1,TOO TECHNICAL & MISLEADING,"This book does more to disuade people from using infrared as another medium.Overly technical, complicates matters involving infrared film, which is not all that difficult to use. Also has factual errors and no info on flash photography with infrared.There are better, more comprehensive books on infrared that detail just how easy it can be to use this wonderful film, without complicating and contradictory information.Poor quality reproductions and uninteresting images too.Steer clear of this book!"
5,Excellent Book for Professional Photographers,"This book is quite technical and is not meant for amateur photographers who want to dabble with IR for a couple of rolls to play around with. For professionally trained photographer's, this book is the standard of excellence in IR. So I disagree with those who have given this book low rating reviews. But I understand why. It is a very technical book aimed at understanding the nuances of IR film.. When one thinks about it, without an understanding of a film's characteristic's you are just guessing no matter what the film type!!! Bravo for this important work!!!"
2,Nice Idea poor creation,"nice detail. that's about all this figure has to offer. he cant be posed to ""Aim"" his weapon,he has a brief case (for some wacky reason) and the ""T-virus"" sample cant even be placed in it. he has a gun holster but no pistol to put it in. I say the company ""mobydick"" still has the best biohazard (RE) hunk figure. i mean come on . on the mobydick version you can remove his helmet and see what hunk looks like! all in all this Resident Evil 10th Anniversary Series 1 Hunk Action Figure is not worth 20.00$."
4,Good buy,"Great bag...a little on the heavy side, but over all a really good buy. Fits my 14"" laptop snugly. I can't imagine it holding anything much bigger."
1,Misleading,"Ok, so this review says it will hold a laptop with a 15.4"" screen size, but does it? NO! No where even close and I have tried all I can. The place where I bought it from even says it is a 15.4"" screen and I have measured it too. Will absolutely not fit."
5,GREAT KVM,this is great for IT or anyone who works on computers . . with just a push of a button you can change from computer to computerworks great when working on or reinstalling the OS ... you can have your main tower still hooked up and find drivers and so on .... then put on flash drive and click to the other computer and pop in the flash drive....no more un pluging yours to fix another or have mice and kayboards and monitors all overcords are 4-5 feet long ..
2,Before you waste your money....,"It does not work for pokemon gaming, otherwise I am sure its a great device. Does anyone know if I could possibly get a refund and return it?"
3,cool feature but not really needed,"everybody seems to be raving about the nintendo ds , but buying ds now is a total rip off , you pay about $150, you get a lame metroid demo and a handfull of games to choose from, and for the most part your getting the same games they have for gc and gba, I'll buy it in a year when I have time to compare the psp to the ds , I don't see why they would make another gameboy along with the ds , seems like it would be more logical to develop a home gaming system, this whole handheld gaming market is just a phaze and to me it's about to get overcrowded, I think they should focus making games better, if you ask me"
4,good umbrella cover,i used this patio umbrella cover to enclose my 13 ft. umbrella. fits perfectly even at the base. will enjoy several years before i expect to replace it.
4,Pleasant surprise on bar stools,Bar stools were as described and meet my expectations. Color was perfect. The color blends very well and is close to the darkness of my expresso kitchen cabinets. Very pleased for the price. The lattice type back on the chair is the lightest part and if taken care of should hold up but rest of chair seems very sturdy and were easy to assemble.
3,Great for price,"Got 2 of these and am completely satisfied. They are fairly easy to put together once you take your time and read the instructions. They look nice and work. I have had mine for just over a year and feel I got value for money. Don't expect top quality at this price, but having looked endlessly for counter height stools at an affordable price and nice looking, these were the closest I got to perfect. The weaved slats that make up the backrest have recently started to pop out of the grooves and have to be pushed back in, but to be honest I am not complaining considering what I paid."
4,the early birds get the worm....or at least a head start,"I found this book to be very helpfull in planning for the junior year...it gave me alot of insight. i purchased copies for my children...to get them motivated and helpful in planning for the upcomming school years. I like how it was broken down into sections by year. The suggestions/quotes by students/counselors. The time line gives me a starting point...before reading this i was overwhelmed with where to start, when and what i needed."
4,Right on target,"You could spend weeks going through web sites and come up with the same info yourself -or- you can go straight to the things that need to be done, first things first."
5,Old favorite of mine.,"For some reason, this flavor has always been hard to find in stores. That's kind of a pity because it's pretty good, and useful to boot. Its texture and mild flavor go along with a lot of chicken dishes I make, and I've recently discovered it also goes well as a side to Quorn chicken breasts. Give it a try!"
1,Hippy music,"Hippy music is what it sounds like, not what i expected, no big deal i have hippy friends and i'm sure i could trade it for something that they don't like."
3,In Service to Koba,"A good but not great biography. Robert Service, while not gifted with a felicitous writing style, does bring a store of knowledge to this difficult subject. I do find fault with several points the author makes; for example, he views the U.S. as being driven mostly by commercial reasons in offering up the Marshall Plan after World War II. Somehow, this attempt at American ""hegemony"" understandably provoked Stalin into the Cold War. The idea that the West might have good reason to contain the murderous regime of Stalin and prevent the further extension of Communism does not fully register with Professor Service. Another example is about the concluding phase of World War II. Stalin's role in regard to Japan is not given an accurate depiction in light of the recent work by Professor Hasegawa in ""Racing the Enemy.""Somehow the millions of souls killed by Stalin get muted attention as this book strives to show Stalin as a person, however greatly flawed, not as a card board villain."
3,Very well then --- a sane and accomplished monster,"Many people may view Stalin as a blood-thirsty killer but the author's view is that Stalin ""..was long practised in the art of solving public problems by means of the physical liquidation of those who embodied them."" (page 471). Physical liquidation sounds so much better than murder, slaughter or killing. It is a much more civilized way to solve public problems."
1,Hoped for a fascinating story - terribly disappointed,"As I read about the WW II Russian front and Stalin's actions in other books during the past year, I decided that a good biography on Stalin would be a fascinating, interesting, read. After reading that the Washington Post rated Service's book one of the ""Best Books of the Year for 2005"" and that it was a ""Winner in Biography"" in the Independent Publishers Book Awards for 2005, I thought this would be the one. Instead, I was disappointed to read a book as uninteresting as the history books that I studied in high school and college; books that turned me against history for the next 30 years. It was well-researched and full of details but so are encyclopedias.I have read quite a few great biographies on people as diverse as Huey Long and Charles Darwin; but, to me, ""Stalin, a Biography"" was a waste of time."
4,Great read and full of information.,"This was by far one of the best biographies I have ever read and it taught me more about Stalin than any study I have endeavored so far. Service really gets into depth when it comes to exposing and analyzing Stalin's manipulative personality without being too mundane regarding the cliche personification that usually labels Stalin (a simple-minded paranoid killer). Service takes us deep inside Stalin's mind, personal life, and political quest to expose the true man that lies beneath; something few have been able to do. The book did have a few places where it seemed to drag on and the information became repetitive and dry, but for the most part it was very informative and even surprisingly entertaining."
2,Thorough perhaps but redundant,"Contrary to what some other reviewers have stated, I do not believe Service goes out of his way to humanize Stalin. However, Service glosses over huge and momentous events, such as the Great Terror. We have all heard of the monstrous acts committed by Stalin but none of the details are given, other than numbers and names. It seems inconceiveable that a 600 plus page book would be superficial and lacking specificity but it does. One gets the feeling Service felt previous biographers had already provided the dirty details and therefore left them out. He also does not tell Stalin's story in any chronological manner. He jumps around endlessly. I cannot recommend this book."
3,"Helpful, but disappointing","While I sense as a non-expert that this biography has freed us from some of the stereotypes about Stalin which clouded the views of him in the past, probably exactly because Stalin's hold on power was defined by his ability to operate in the shadows before he emerged on center stage, and even then managed to keep a lot of the world guessing about what exactly his role was. Deniability figured big time in his history. The book nevertheless falls short. The style is somewhat plodding, and there is an implicit assumption that we are experts on Soviet history, and geography, and no aids are on offer in that regard. So in being NOT an expert on Soviet history, I find myself after reading this book that I need to read a history of the Soviet Union and probably of Russia, in order to provide me with the context which this book sorely lacks."
1,Worst Item Ever Purchased,"I owned a 5820 it did not work out of the box. The ""support"" at website consists of several broken links. Their ""SARA"" system points you to more broken links, then asks ""was this helpful?"" I tried ""fixes"" on the web including uninstalling completely, then replacing 5820 drivers with 5800 drivers, and opening the scanner and manually moving the drive belt(!). Some people claim these work but nothing worked for me. The scanner says it's ""locked"" but it HAS NO LOCK - it simply does not work no matter what you do with it. Stay away from this scanner, don't even accept one as a gift, it's not worth the aggravation."
1,piece of junk!!!,"This does not even deserve one star.We got this scanner as a gift and what a piece of junk. We have tried on 4 different computers including windows 98, NT,and XP. After the first 2 scans, it says it is locked even after installing the newest drivers. Visioneer sent new software. That did not help. The offered me a new one, but only if I paid to ship the old one to them. I couldn't return it to the store because I had it past the return date. It is now going in the trash because it would not be worth the money to send them the scanner just to get another piece of crap back in the mail. Do not buy this scanner. You will just muck up your computer with software and have to return it. Worst scanner ever!!!"
5,safe and secure,"Came in bubble wrapped glass safe and secure.It is so nice to have a gel tab melt in my mouth that taste good. I'd tried the store brands and they tasted like dead fish treated with linseed oil.I Used Solgar 30 years ago while my body was stressed from long hours and melting in the mouth helped keep my mouth and throat healthy. I took a Solgar multiple tab, Vit C and E at that time.I was so pleased to now find my old allies at an affordable price again allowing me to do some good for myself."
4,Wonderful Book,"I am a recent convert to Orthodox. Our family has been Orthodox for 3 years. I was given this book at our Chrismation. It has been a wonderful book. It is very encouraging and it gives so much to think about each day. This is a book that I like to read once a year. I will usually read more than just one of the devotions each day. I will spend a few weeks going over it, maybe a bit longer. I find that it really puts my heart and mind straight on several issues that I struggle with regularly."
1,The Traditional Values Coalition seal of approval?,"I was shocked, and eventually creeped out, by the amount of gay-bashing in this book -- especially by characters who are supposed to be heroes. There was no solid plot reason for the bad guy to be gay, so I have to suppose Arnette Lamb simply doesn't like homosexuals very much. Other reviewers have mentioned the infuriating thick-headedness of the heroine, the squickiness of the brother-sister romance, and the woodenness of the dialogue, so I won't bother repeating those complaints. I would normally expect better -- and a little more sympathy for the underdog -- from a best-selling author."
1,"This is probably not the ""real"" thing. :(","If glycerin is one of the listed ingredients, then this is definitely NOT the original formula. Also, if it's made by Idelle Labs in 2004 or earlier, the formula is close but not identical. But read the list of ingredients very carefully or you will be disappointed. Believe me, if I was able to list 1/2 a star, I would have."
3,"Great information and explanations, NLT is poor translation","The information provided to apply the bible to your life and to help men with problems they face daily is second to none. They cover family, work, marriage, sexual temptation and more. My only complaint is the NLT is a very poor translation that will change the bible passages meaning from its original text. This would be a tremendous resource if used with another translation such as the ESV or NIV."
1,Every Man's Bible,"The constuction of the Bible is very poor. I bought the Bible for a birthday gift for my son in Iowa, I live in NY. He opened the wrapper and the pages started falling out of the book. I wish that I had opened the book I would have sent it right back."
5,For Everyone,"I bought this for my husband and have never seen him enjoy reading the Bible as he does now. The information at the beginning of each book is great: about how long it will take to read the book, summary of the chapters, key verses for memorizing, who it was written by (if known) and it places the events in a timeline. It's wonderful! I have even started reading out if it myself! It's a great Bible, I highly recommend it."
2,Content good - font terrible,"I really liked this bible, the content, sidebar notes, intros all seem to be very helpful. However the size and color of the typeface, a sort of gray, doesn't contrast with the off white paper and makes this bible impossible to read for any extended period. Would be a great bible if it were printed in a more readable font."
2,Worked O K for five months,It worked great for five months. Good thing a spare was ordered as the rubber gasket has already split on the first one.
5,Great!,"This is the best stopper for our bathtub... It was no longer available at the local places and I was going to have to find a poor substitute. Then I looked on Amazon, and there it was. I could not help ordering some for us and for the other people living on our court."
2,Not Bad-But Not In My Car,"I was terribly disappointed with this item. It worked fine in home and office when I could put the nano and transmitter right ON the tuner. It was terrible in my car. I'd used a similar product-the itrip from Griffin on my ipod mini-so I'm familiar with how this type of device works. That thing was awesome, but I broke it, and wanted a smaller ipod, so I got a nano. There was nowhere close enough for me to put it to get a good sound in my car. I had to hold ipod and transmitter an inch or so away to get anything decent-yeah, try that driving a manual. I think I'm going to try the one by Griffin."
3,Not satisfied,"I ordered this to give as a gift to my son. Not only it arrived on time but also I was told that the shipment couldn't be tracked. Of course, my money got refunded but me and my son was disappointed. Hope this doesn't happen again."
1,Bad if you are buying this for your car,"I was worried about it and my fears came true. This works well with your home radio, but the quality is horrible when you use it in your car. The whole Mono/Stereo conversion never worked."
1,Does not fit,Belkin F8Z061-BLK TuneFM for iPod Nanos (Black)I received this item for Christmas. It was bought at KMART. They refuse to exchange it or refund it because it was a gift to me. It does not fit an Ipod nano even though the box says it does. I am very disappointed with both KMART and Belkin.
1,Junk,"This item is absolutely worthless, don't waste your time! I'm returning mine to Target tomorrow.There are laws against false advertising, I don't know why they're not enforced.I will never buy ANYTHING made by Belkin again."
1,Wouldn't recommend this product.,This product did not fit my iPod Nano even though the product description said that it would. I would have liked more specifics on which iPod this actually fits.
4,Dark and atmosphereic,"Decoded Feedback is awesome at producing the darker, slower type of techno. Even after listening to their latest releases, I still really liked Technophoby. The samples used in this album are a cool addition that make the songs seem even more apocalyptic. Decoded Feedback fans, this one's a keeper."
4,"Really entertaining, a lot of fun to play.","I found myself totally engrossed in this game. It is visually delightful, imaginative and enough of a challenge to be really interesting. I thoroughly enjoyed the 1920's haunted ship,the story, the characters, and the puzzles.Most of all, I enjoyed the creativity, imagination,and challenges of the characters dreamworlds. This is a game worth having. I was entertained and challenged, without blood guts and gore. In fact I ended up buying five of ""Morpheus"" to give as Christmas gifts. If you enjoy the creative and imaginative aspects of gaming, and can be entertained without violence, this is your game."
2,Morpheus is cheap but worth it?,I bought Morpheus allured by the cheap price. But in the first day of play i went online and downloaded as many cheats as possible because the game was too frustrating for me. The puzzles just didn't make sense. Then I bought Myst shortly after and had a blast without the headache. Morpheus was a few days of fun but in my opinion just spend a little more and get Myst or Riven.
2,OK for the price,"A beautifully rendered, but strange and wasteful tale. I bought Morpheus because it was inexpensive and the type of game I love. But I was quickly plunged into a muddled, strange and frankly, uninteresting plot involving a bunch of awful people that deserved their awful fates.After perservering through several pointless and not-very-tricky puzzles, you discover that everyone gets what they deserve. And, from the original days of Myst, we're used to a slight let-down at the end, as a movie-ette wraps up the final details of our long ordeal, but Morpheus just leaves you wondering - did the programmers know what happened to our heros?"
3,Not Very Interesting,"The graphics of this game were very good. However, this is one of the only strong features about this game. The story line had so much potential, but was enacted in a very lame fasion. The dream sequences good have been a lot better, and if there was a climax, I missed it. The puzzles were not very challenging, and the ending was weak. I would spend my money elsewhere."
2,Hard to get into,"I got bogged down with this book and gave up after two or three chapters. It's not for the casual reader (which I am). I'm sure there's a germ of something good here, but it was just lost on me. My guess is that someone with more patience or more expertise might enjoy it, but not the layman."
4,Refreshing,"Consider me one incapable of stomaching most of the EBM/electro-industrial that gets released nowadays. This truly is a breath of fresh air when compared to the other 99% of the aforementioned genres, and 'Black Death' and 'In The Night' rank amongst the catchiest :wumpscut: songs of all time."
3,Some major mistakes in the details,"The devil is in the details, and unfort., Weintraub gets some of them spectacularly WRONG. I will only use one example: he writes that G. Washington was a brigadier general during the Fr. & Ind. War. That is totally wrong. GW was never able to secure so much as a captaincy in the British Army, so the classification of him as a brigadier general during the 1758 Forbes campaign is just bunk. Forbes was not the commander in chief so he could not award commissions in the regular army, all of which had to be approved by the King eventually. On the basis of his commission as Colonel in the Virginia Regiment, Washington could serve at that rank in charge of a collection of provincial regiments which could be referred to as a brigade, but he would not carry any rank in the regular army and he would not command regular troops."
5,The Best of both Handel and Beecham,"I bought Beecham's Solomon on the original Seraphim 33s back in about 1958. I've played it so much that the old 33s were filled with scratches and skips and finally became unplayable. I listened to a new performance on CD, and could not enjoy it because it just didn't sound like Handel.I continued to check for a remastering of Beecham's version, and finally, it's here! It was and is the best interpretation of Solomon that I've ever heard. If Beecham has left out some of the original score, he did it for sound reasons.Beecham put together a performance of Messiah with Jennifer Vivian, Monica Sinclair, etc. that is far and away the best of that Handel work. It's presumptuous of conductors coming along after Beecham to think that they can improve on Beecham's interpretation of any Handel work, certainly including Solomon."
2,"Great for stink...stains, not so much.","Ok, so I bought this at my local commissary because we recently got a puppy and part of this products marketing was a ""Most 5 star ratings from amazon users"".It did take away the odor or puppy accidents but it didn't remove the stains whatsoever.....i mean...seriously didn't budge at all. And they were new stains...it's not like they had been setting for a week or something. Just really dissappointed."
5,Absolute must-have product for kids or pets!,"I found a bottle of this at my local grocery store, and bought it without high expectations... Wow! I definitely wasn't expecting the quality of the product to be so high! You can put this stuff on literally anything, even pour it on a spot and let it dry to eliminate odors. I can even use it in my carpet cleaning machine. What really did it for me was when it took out a hot chocolate stain that was dried on my carpet for weeks, while nothing else would take it out. I would recommend this product to anyone!!!"
2,disappointed,I was disappointed with Kids 'N' Pets Stain & Odor remover. This product did not remove the stains. Used it as directed on stains and did not see any difference. These were pet stains just occurring within the day and pet stains that had happened days before. My dog was diagnosed with a urine bacteria soon after the attempt to remove these stains but the product should have performed better based on the description. Will go back to my earlier product.
3,stain & odor remover,"It was ok. It had a very strong alcohol smell at first, but afterwards it left kind of a sweet smell to it. i had to use it 2 to 3 times to get the urine smell out of my couch, but it was ok i guess"
1,no good,"Bought this because the reviews said it would work, did not. Bought two bottles to use on sofa where dog had left her mark and soaked the area as suggested on the bottle, waited for it to dry and ended up with a residual smell and tide mark, did not remove pee smell. Save your money."
1,Horrible Product-please read before you use.....,"I purchased this product after our dog had a urine accident on our new carpet. I trusted the labels that said that it was safe to use on carpet. Well after that one use, my new green carpet has a nice pink spot right in the middle of the room. I have had a disaster clean up company look at it and they have said that there is nothing that I can do. I will probably have to replace that area of carpet. I really wish I could go back and not buy this cleaner- using water on the urine spot would have been better and much less expensive!!! I wouldn't even give it one star."
1,waste of money,I used this product after my little dog decided to use my bedroom as her toilet. It was a major waste of money. NOTHING changed. The room still smell of dog urine. Save your money
5,It works better than Nature's Miracle,"I have used Nature's Miracle for years but something has changed in their formula. It still smells the same but it isn't as reliable as it used to be. I saw this at Fred Meyer's and decided to give it a shot because of the tag on the bottle stating it had more 5 star ratings than any other product. Well, here's another one. I walked away while doing a water change in my saltwater fish tank. I wet-vac'd up as much of the water as I could and thought that it would dry just fine. I went on an overnight trip and when I returned it smelled like a landfill in my living room. I used Kids 'N' Pets and it removed the mildew smell overnight and it never came back. I then tried it on an old fruit punch stain that the nature's miracle failed to get out that's over a year old and it removed that stain as well! I love this stuff! I just wish they sold it in a larger bottle so I didn't have to buy 3 bottles or more each time I want to shampoo my carpets with my Bissell."
4,Best stain remover I've found,"With multiple cats and a toddler, I've tried about every stain remover out there. Most leave a residual stain after cleaning. (And beware using multiple cleaners on one spot!) Anyway, Kids 'n' Pets works extremely well on a multitude of stains. I knocked one star off the rating due to the nozzle. It's basically a squirt nozzle and you end up saturating your carpet very easily. But I got a spray bottle for $1 at my local discount retailer which corrects the problem. I recommend this for anyone frustrated with finding a cleaner that works."
4,Worth the price!,"This product is well worth the cost. It is a little more expensive than the regular upholstery and carpet cleaners, but it has the added enzyme and natural citrus. Which is the one thing needed to really do away with an odor or stain. My daughter had an accident on the couch while we were potty training and even after I had used two other products on the stain Kids N' Pets still got the odor out. I have also used this on a rug that our puppy had an accident on. The next thing I am going to tackle is the mattress...(another accident). I am confident that this product will once again prove itself worth the purchase."
3,Not what I'd hoped for...,"It was Ms. Laine's dynamic cameo in the thoroughly entertaining movie LAST OF THE BLOND BOMBSHELLS which prompted me to investigate her musical work. This CD sampler, however, proved something of a disappointment. Drawing largely on the easy listening classics of the 1960's and 1970's, Ms. Laine essentially phones in her performance. I once heard languid-voiced Perry Como described as a man ""who sings while lying in bed."" Well, it strikes me that Ms. Laine was lying there beside him when she recorded this album. I waited out song after song for her to cut loose in the tradition of belters like Garland and Carr, but I was left unsatisfied. Only on ""Killing Me Softly"" did Ms. Laine invest the harrowing words with some semblance of strong emotion, as though the music had, at last, touched a responsive chord inside her, and I must say that her rendition of that one song is the mostpowerful I've heard."
5,Why No Discount?!,"This is one of Ozu's greatest movies and it comes with Wim Wender's homage to Ozu, Tokyo-Ga. But usually Amazon gives a substantial discount on unreleased Criterions. Why isn't this discounted? I will try to buy it at a lower price. Is this price a mistake?"
2,Don't Bother,I have enjoyed the music of John Addison in many films over the years. However this CD does not carry true renditions of any films original soundtrack. Most sound more like something inspired by a given title. Anyone thinking they are going to finally get to hear the genuine rousing rendition of some movie from years ago will be very disappointed.
4,Great for making sweet bread and butter pickles,Slice up a couple cucumbers salt them put in the pickle press until most of the water is removed and continue with your favorite sweet pickle recipe
2,A poor representation of pantheism,"I am a philosophy major, and this book did not have what I was looking for."
2,"Blah, blah, blah, blah, way too verbose","I totally agree with the authors' arguments. We do indeed have a class system in the United States, and it really does matter. But my god this is a horrible book. The authors go on and on and on and on and on and on about the same things. This is another one of those books that should have been shortened into a 10 page magazine article. It was so bad that I had to stop reading it half way through.A much better book is Paul Fussell's somewhat dated ""Class: A Guide Through the American Status System""."
5,Everyone should read this,"If you're like me and you live in a community that is pretty much isolated from truly interacting with the lower-classes in any meaningful way, this book is educative to the extreme. It takes truths that we know about, but haven't experienced ourselves, like not having health insurance or living in modern-day tenament housing, and allows the reader to examine the social and cultural forces that allow this to exist.I had read the series when they were published in the NY Times last summer, but reading it in one compilation packs a punch. Anyone that says we live in a class-less society should have their eyes opened with this book."
4,Class Matters,"Class Matters explores income, social class, wealth's causal factors, social class mobility, the reality of the American Dream, old versus new money, class distinctions, types of neighborhoods and enclaves, mixed class marriages, tax policy and the rapidly growing wealth disparity and more. I especially liked the chapter, ""Old Nantucket Warily Meets the New."" This book provides insight into the very poor to the über-rich and everything in between. It is a fascinating look into social class in America. Each chapter is a separate topic written by a different New York Times contributor. And many real life examples are used to drive the points home. If you enjoy sociology, you will find this book to be a very interesting read."
4,Class Matters - and This Book Documents How,"I read the articles from which the book comes. And they prove that your income, occupation, and personal financial resources have a major impact on the quality of your education, health care, housing and even your place of worship. It affects with whom you socialize. And this also has an impact on what class your child is likely to end up in when he or she graduates."
4,Good but not as Good as Mangalam,Good tea..but not as good as Mangalam Assam. Is more bit more malty and bit less flavorful than Mangalam. Also fairly light bodied for an Assam black.None the less better than many other Assam teas and hence a 4 star.
3,A reprint text,"The Great Mathematicians is a conversational text (no graphs, charts, or formulas) about mathematicians whose ideas have influenced or touched us into the 20th century. Written in the 1930's, this edition is a 1993 reprint, so I figure that the author's ideas have a sort of permanency, also.Turnbull discusses nine immortal mathematicians and mentions dozens of others. In the 1930s he clearly had a grasp on the directions of mathematics, but his slant definitely is toward geometry and calculus. He does not even mention mathematical logicians.I liked the personal descriptions of the lives of mathematicians. Yet this book only begins to give a slant on the history of development of mathematics, the cross currents of the field. This book would be an interesting supplement to a college level or high school honors class, but the students will not emerge with a time-line of mathematical development.Or, you could read this for general interest and still get something from it."
4,Great Brush!,"Great brush makes great contour lines and very sharp lines. Only con of this is that the tip is super small and thin. A lil overpriced as well but still works really good, love the texture and feel. Easy to just pick up and use on the go.:)"
2,yuck yuck yuck,My fiance got me this for Christmas and while it was a VERY sweet thought this easel is awful! The three unsupported legs make it unstable and since EVERYTHING is adjustable it is difficult to make it level. Expect to get out a level EVERYTIME you want to set it up. It is usable but not very convenient. As a former art student and art teacher I have seen and used many types of easels. You are better off with something with more support for the legs and less things to adjust which may not be as portable but better to use.
3,Not bad for the price.,"Like the review below stated, this easel is a little wobbly. It doesn't close easily because of some missalignments. The wood is also of subpar quality. I've looked at alot of french easels and the more expensive ones just have better wood and I assume the parts are aligned better. I'm going to mainly use this on the road and don't really need super stability so I'm pretty happy with it. If you want something that will last a long time however, I would suggest spending a bit more for a better model."
4,Easel,This easel is very compact and easy to store. The adjustable legs make for the perfect hight and the price is right. This is a wonderful bargain.
4,Works but some of the bolts are crooked.,"The easel is pretty good. It is everything I wanted and more. I can keep all of my paints inside the drawer even when I fold it and put it away. The legs are all adjustable and easy to setup. The only thing I don't like about the easel is the bolts. The bolts are used to secure the legs in place. Some of them came crooked on the threaded part and I can't get them to go on correctly. They still work the way they are, but I just wish they sat flush. My thumbs hurt after tightening the bolts a few times also. It could just be because I as a wuss though. Also, there are no instructions so I had to figure out how to open it up into an easel myself. Not that difficult, but would've been better with instructions. Overall, I am very happy with the easel and it is perfect for what I use it for."
1,gibberish,"Today, within the United States, a ""doctor of naturopathy"" (N.D.) or ""doctor of naturopathic medicine"" (N.M.D.) credential is available from four full-time schools of naturopathy and at least eight nonaccredited correspondence schools, of which seven maintain Web sites [A, B, C, D, E, F, G]. (One correspondence school, the Progressive Universal Life Church, offers a ""Ph.D. in Naturopathy"" for $250 plus ""life experience with no coursework.)eat right,take vitamins, drink water, exercise and get rest - I guess this entitles me to a show on TBN and a million dollar house. Fundamentalist Christians willbelieve anything."
5,A must have,"This is the perfect little bag to carry your psp & things. If your looking for the right travel bag, look no more."
3,a nice fuzzy warm spot they should never have left,"FLAvour is a fun album all around. It lacks the punch of Hard Wired and the aggression of Millenium. But what it lacks it makes up for in the technical, melodic synth lines that have always been Leeb's forte since SP. My girlfriend borrowed my copy 4 months ago and won't give it back, if that tells you anything about the worthiness of this album. I think one word sums it up: Dark.In short, you will be publicly executed if you do not buy this album NOW."
3,Welcome to the 21st Cyber-Century !,01:56-1998-Juli++GERMANY CALLING .... +++ TRANSMISSION RECEI%&%&.... +++ Front Line Assembly entering the shadowrun battle area +++ Audio for the urban 21st century ++++ TRANSMISSION END
1,Don't be disappointed.,"This cd is worthless. If you are a FLA fan, stay clear. This cd offers nothing. It's very disppointing and save your money. It should be called worse of the B sides. Cuz that's what you get."
5,They're back!!!,"After a half-decade of decent into the techno-metal genre (mainly fueled by the late, great Rhys Fulber), FLA have finally returned to the roots that all of us old-school fans remember...phase effects, string sounds, and heavy underdubs to bring it all home. The FLA on this album smacks more of the pre-guitar Corrosion, Disorder, Caustic Grip, and Tactical Neural Implant (their best!!!) albums. If FLA continues this trend, maybe other artists that they inspired originally will follow their lead (again) and stop sucking as much as they do."
4,Hi-tech cyberbreakbeats,"The album kicks off with a Noise Unit-like number, ""Corruption"", and then moves into the freaky stuff: ""Sado-Masochist"", ""Autoerotic"", ""Columbian Necktie"" and ""Comatose"". Drum & Bass? FLA? The new line-up dares to be different and passes the credibility test with brilliant, flying colours. Rich textures, lively, colourful, yet inversely disturbing. Finally they're learning that understatement gets you further than blatant noise and gloom. The change is as radical as when Millennium was released, when they made that groundbreaking decision to employ death metal guitar riffs. That turned out to be their best album ever, as far as I'm concerned. Totally original and unique."
3,The cover picture was impressive,"as was the bonus mini poster of Jon (I would have preferred a group picture in a CD that was about the group), however the CD is a hodge-podge of interviews that bounces back and forth and you are never quite sure what the guys are talking about. I did enjoy listening though and did learn some facts about some of the songs and stuff, but I don't think I would spend the money on this if I had to do it all over."
3,I like it,I like this album for the most part. Good listen and addition to the Earth series by LTJ Bukem. Buy it!
3,"""Boyhood Dream"" Review","A re-titled DVD release of ""Heartbreak Express Tour"", this DVD features eight Shawn Michaels matches from 1996-97. Shawn takes on Bret Hart, British Bulldog, Vader, Diesel, and Sycho Sid among others but unfortunately, all of the matches have been cut. Though it is priced at under $10 in most areas so it's worth picking up if you're a WWF fan but if you want to see the best HBK matches in their full format, pick up ""From The Vault"". It's somewhat of a mystery as to why the WWE chose to release one of their old Coliseum Video videos in DVD format but nonetheless, I hope it's the start of a trend."
3,Upgrade from VHS to DVD,"Back when this came out this was a great VHS, I got this just to upgrade from VHS to DVD that is all there is nothing added it is just the VHS in DVD form."
3,Could have had at least 3 more matches,It was ok but way too short for a DVD at least. The ladder match with Razor Ramone was not included.
2,Cheap Quality,"I ordered this item and if the product were better built with more robust plastics this would be a great product. However, the quality is really bad. The plastic molding had several parts that did not fit properly and would not slide in position to interlock. The plastic bends easily with light ponding on the ground, even if the ground is fairly soft or recently tilled. I would recommend ""Pound-In Edging"" instead if you are looking for a system that interlocks."
3,Not Worth the price,"This product provides nice support, but buyer should not expect significant improvement in body contouring. The product is also unconfortable in that it does not stay firm at midriff and creates a roll of material around the waist. You can get as good result from Leggs' body beautiful as you can get from this product for a price under $10.00 and without the hassle of pulling the garment up often to keep it in place at midriff.Dr. SC. Vargas"
1,(Almost) A waste of money,"Sorry, but if not the story about being a battered wife, this product is just uncomfortable panty hose. the waist keeps dropping, the legs keep riding up, and I didn't(& no-one else for that matter) notice any sculpting or lifting going on."
2,Misunderstood,"I gave the fobus only 2 stars because while the title of the holster says it fits a sig 229 with rails and .40 caliber, it does not. The holster is too small, apparently only fitting the 9mm version. The holster itslef was exactly what i expected, it simply doesnt fit my firearm. I may have misunderstood the description so i dont want to give a poor review, however ive purchased a few holsters recently and when it states its for a sig 229 .40 cal, all the other brands/types fit. I recommend purchasing this holster from amazon directly or a company in close proximity to you so that if it isnt the right holster it is worth it to exchange it, instead of trying to ship it back to isreal or just eating the cost."
3,"OWB with FBI cant for P229 without rail. Good tension, maybe too good...","I have been on the hunt for a good outside the waistband holster for the Sig Sauer P229 classic (no rail & rounded trigger guard). Sig no longer supports paddle holsters for this pistol, and a customer service rep referred me to Fobus, Bianchi, and Serpa for compatible options. This holster is pictured in a vertical position, but features a forward pitch that I found uncomfortable. I didn't verify that it is 15 degrees, but assume it is because that what is popular these days.The tension is excellent and perhaps excessive. 1 out of 4 times I pulled the holster out of my pants trying to draw the pistol. Training would likely resolve this, but the angle made my wrist hurt. I am looking for something that offers a true vertical positioning.This would work if you're familiar with the FBI cant & are okay with wearing a robust belt for retention. Purchased, and returned."
3,MIGHT HAVE BEEN BETTER,"I HAVE ALREADY WRITTEN A REVIEW FOR THIS PRODUCT, MY COMMENT WAS RELATED TO THE HEAT THE FLOWERS SUSTAINED BECAUSE OF HOT DAY HOT TRUCK. ORDER FLOWERS IN THE COOLER MONTHS. BUT UNDER THESE CONDITIONS THEY WERE STILL BEAUTIFUL. I AM GLAD I DID NOT ORDER CHOCOLATES."
2,Les Cyclopes with Trevor Pinnock is much better,"If you are after a CD because you like the Harpsicord, then the two CD's to get are Les Cyclopes with Trevor Pinnock and The Harmonious Blacksmith Arkiv Production CD with Trevor Pinnock. The subject CD is only fair. Get the other two CD's. This terse review will balance my usually verbose reviews. Want more? See my other reviews. But I told you what to do CD-buying-wise for harpsicord."
1,Waste of Money,I thought this would be good for black outs. I paid $20 and out of the box it never worked. The White LEDs onlystay lit as long as you crank. However the worthless amber side lights will light. I threw it away the first day.
4,Great backpack for a preschooler,"My fifth grader granddaughter ordered this but ended up giving it to her little sister who is four. It is so very small that it is just right for the little one. It won't hold her books at preschool but will do for a sweater (hers are small) and a toy or two for going out to a restaurant.This is a very pretty, very well made backpack. Just keep in mind that it is not very large. If you want a very small backpack, then this would do very well for you."
1,backpack rating.,"My experience was HORRIBLE. They sent me the WRONG backpack(pink instead of black) and they refused to reimburse for shipping and return shipping, even though it was their fault. Amazon eventually gave me a credit to use for their website only, but I do not want anything from them. I will never do business with either of these companies again, because they do not care about the customer."
4,Suspend your disbelief. It's worth it.,"This is an odd but absorbing book. Mr. Pottermack, very clever, very industrious and very sympathetic, hides his blackmailer's body and hopes to woo his lost love. But will the very clever detective discover his secret? The key clue involves something that no modern person will understand and there are some hugely implausible plot elements, but the book is worth it."
3,Great dagger!,"Great dagger! It is heavy,well made, and balanced. The sheath, however, is a disappointment. Such a nice dagger you'd think they would take a little more care with the sheath. It is poorly made and does not fit the dagger."
2,timpani duet with only one timpanist,"I love Philip Glass and his music, but as a timpanist, I am a bit dissapointed in Evelyn Glennie and Jonathan Hass. The two do not play well together, and I feel that one was a much stronger player than the other. I am assuming that Evelyn Glennie was the weaker of the two because she is a percussionist and not strictly a Timpanist like Mr. Hass, although I could be wrong. I have seen Ms. Glennie live and she is an amazing marimba player, so she can perform. But one set of timps sounded thin and I even heard some rim shots. I feel that this should have been recorded with two professional timpanist, that play every day, just timpani. It would have been a real treat if one player was Duff style and the other Goodman style. It seems this album was trying for some kind of commercial appeal by choosing Glennie."
3,Bang the drum showily,"The cello concerto is, for Glass, surprisingly lyrical. Nothing earth shaking, but not bad, and certainly well played. The kettledrum business, I'm afraid, is the most appalling piece of cheese, featuring a series of orchestral themes that seem to have been lifted from bad B-movies. That opening motif, which sounds like it should accompany marauding Vikings as their ship approaches the coast, makes me wince. I had the curious experience of hearing this piece the other day in concert, played by far lesser talents than these, and I was struck by how so much tympanic fury signified precisely nothing. No doubt the electric presence of Evelyn Glennie in all her barefoot glory would go a long way toward making this piece tolerable in concert. But this is not a DVD, alas. However, I give the record an extra star for great sound quality. If for some reason you crave a ton of aimless kettle bashing, well, here it is, backed by music suitable for a Siegfried & Roy stage show."
2,Disappointing Jill Valentine 10th Anniversary Fig!,"Jill Valentine is terrible. The sculpt is just awful. Her face is puffy and her eyes look drugged. She looks like Kirsten Dunst on a bad day. Not to mention her accessories are just another poor attempt on NECA's part. Since when does Jill have grenades in Resident Evil? Why is NECA re-using accessories from the RE 4 line? She comes with several grenades from the RE 4 line, with her Samurai Edge gun, and ""defense weapon"" taser. This figure is the biggest dissappointment in the history of NECA's Resident Evil line. And now there's news of the variant (also known as the ""chase figure"") which is Jill Valentine with dark green shoulder pads and dark green pants; another poorly-attempted stunt on NECA's part. Tsk, tsk!"
2,Problem with Casio Tough Solar Watch,"My battery seems to be dead, possibly caused by wearing long sleeved shirts in the winter. Now, I'll have to find a repair place.Also, the watch band is lousy. The strap guard constantly slides around, making me have to secure it several times a day. You'd think that if they were so clever to figure out a new charging method, they would also put a decent watchband on it as well.It is a pain in the neck..."
4,casio g shock,"Accurate, lightweight for a large watch, no problem setting to WWV automatically. Would have liked an alarm to set for future appointments, otherwise this watch is perfect."
2,batt issue,"The watch works well, however the battery has started to die after only 3-4 months of operation."
4,Book suggestion,"This page suggests that you buy the Phrasebook, but my CD actually came with the same book, so then I had two . My husband is Moroccan, and he said the book is pretty good accuracy wise. I have just started learning so, we'll see...."
5,This is a really good piece of music,"this is by far one of the best I've heard and I am a huge fan,it deserves a 5 star rating all the way!the talent that rudy shows in this one is divine!"
1,DeWalt 36 volt Kit,"The kit was shipped to me with two bad batteries. Neither DeWalt or Amazon have offered much help in correcting the problem. While the tools themselves are fine, they are worthless without the batteries. Next time I will buy locally so returns won't be a problem."
2,refurb came in broke,"i purchased this setup and the first time i used the hammer drill, i found out the drill mode was stripped out , ruined my whole job that day as i brought only this drill.i still have yet to try the other tools, but so far not impressed , its also just as heavy as a 18v setup not really job friendly"
2,another disapointment from dewalt,there are so many design problems with the 36v set i just dont know where to start. the extra power? is not noticable but the extra weight and is tromandus.Im working in constraction and have used Dewalt 18v tools for 10 years and evry new set i buy is warse then the earlier one.Stay away from dewalt
2,Dewalt 36v lithium Drill/saw kit,"I bought a refurbished kit. Looked brand new except the drill looked used. It sometimes gets stuck in position 3 of the drill speed. When it is working it does a great job. However it is bulky, heavy and not all that impressive. The clutch also sticks once in a while. I also own a Hitachi 18v Lithium Ion Drill/hamerdrill that I would highly reccomend. Lighter, fits better in the hand and very smooth operating. I wish Hitachi madea 7 1/4 saw but they don,t so I bought the Dewalt. The saw and battery charger are great. The charger is quiet while Hitachi's charger fan is loud enough that you don't want it in the same room."
5,Exceptional in its treatment of the subject.,"Although I am new to Calvinism, therefore no expert on the subject, I found this books explanation of the five points of Calvin's theological grid to be very beneficial in assisting me to understand some of the more difficult portions."
1,DONT BUY THIS!!!!,I bought the 128M version of this product. I is terrible!!! The only way to avoid have ALOT of noise with the music is to turn it up loud. I returned the item because it sounded so terrible.
4,"Complex, Problematic, and Fascinating","A fascinating and extremely difficult collection of essays from philosopher-anthropologist-novelist-librarian Georges Bataille, whose work on literature brings us closer to literarity in terms of Freudian repression. Bataille covers a number of great writers in this collection (Bronte, Genet, Baudelaire, Sade), and attempts to unveil their complicity with evil and eros. For Bataille, writing is eros in the damned sense. He inherits the Platonic legacy which has condemned poetry as that which is always at a double removal from truth. Literature is not an innocent counter-gesture to the decay of civilization, it is itself embedded in thanatos. While Bataille's own prose here is extremely cryptic, and he often subordinates the author's to his own vision, this remains a peculiar and important text."
5,"Response to ""a reader"" from McLean, VA","Lewis' scepticism of carpet bombing is well justified in the context of the book. While carpet bombing was an important part of the eventual breakout, it was not without its problems. For example, the initial bombing raid did more damage to the American infantry, indeed killing a four star general, than it did to the Germans. The breakout then had to be delayed while the American forces were rebuilt. The second carpet bombing raid was more successful. They didn't have time to conduct two raids to get one right on D-Day."
1,british runts,"we would have won the war in 1776 if those meddling brits had let us fire nuclear powered john wayne wigs at those german sob,s and there evil adolph bin von laden hussian leader.get some."
3,It could have been better,"I learned a lot about the many mistakes made at Omaha Beach, it was criminal the errors that caused many to die. What I wished was in this book was more than why it failed but a narration of the actual battle connecting the failures with the results."
4,Detailed analysis of Amphibian Doctrine.,Omaha Beach details the doctrine based system of warfare or basically politics of war. It reads well and has lots of information about the different ideas and plans for the invasion that the commanders wanted to use but was scrapped as soon as the ramps opened. People expecting a forward account on the battle itself will be disappointed since only the first chapter actually talks about it. But if you want to know everything there is to know about the stratagies of warfare then this book is it.
3,"So many acronyms, so little time...","Patton's assessment of Omar Bradley is starting to look more and more accurate. Bradley and his cohorts badly underestimated several aspects of needed resources for the invasion of Omaha Beach. Failure to look to the Pacific campaign for the ""been there and done that"" on-the-job experience learned by the Navy and Marines, resulted in higher casualties than necessary. Throw in poor communication between the Army, Navy, and the Army Air Corps, and you have the makings of a near disaster. Lewis should be commended for his homework and thoughtful analysis, however this book reads like a long memorandum from one military officer to another."
4,Good item for the money!,I was simply looking for a reasonably priced crib mobile and this one fit the bill. Not a big Duke fan however it was blue which matched the color scheme of my son's crib. Works great!
4,The Mulberry Empire,"An evocative novel of the British Raj, and the disastrous First Afghan War. By using actual participants of the period the author makes the story compelling and factual. The author's description of life in Kabul in the early ninetheen century is most believable."
5,I love it! Need another for my friend!,This is my favorite CD! The mix is great and was a hit at my end of year school parties for four years so far!Highly recommended for the cool teenaged crowd!
4,"Well researched, with attention to her music","Probably one of the best all-round bios of Lady Day, covering the personal and professional. Pays attention to her musical preferences and reasoning behind her unique recording style"
4,Lady Day,Book was in great shape. Shipped quickly with no issues. Happy with the product and service. Nothing more to add.
3,Another hoolie book ...........,"The thing that bothers me about this book is that Cass Pennant, as the author, doesn't really write anything. You've got a two page intro, a bunch of interviews with leaders of 15 to 20 soccer/football firms, and a weak, weak conclusion. The questions that he asks each leader change very little, so it becomes a little repetitious (5 top firms now, top firms of all time, weapons used, activity today, etc). I did like hearing from leaders of some of the smaller clubs in England. Any club, no matter how small, could pull a formidable firm in the 70s and 80s.If you want a bunch of accounts of ""We ran them, they ran us, we took their end, etc"", then this book is for you. If you want an actual written, thought-out narrative --i.e. Among the Thugs, Bovver, Scally -- then this isn't what you're looking for. I guess I should have known, as the title says, ""True STORIES of Football's Hardest Men."" Oh well, my fault."
3,Give it 3.5 stars,"First, Olivia's assistant Winslow is a terrific character. One does feel the first book should have been read first; I often wondered what background information I was missing. There are some great moments, especially regarding danger and suspense. Honestly I was more intrigued by secondary characters the Wolfhound and sister Cara than by the romantic leads here. I did like Davenport, a lot, but he seemed much too insecure to make a good mate for Olivia. As for her, I never really warmed up to her. The suspense was quite good, but the romance lacked something for me. I'm interested in the other books, particularly the one I imagine is on tap regarding the Wolfhound and Cara, but I wasn't thrilled by this one. Three 3 1/2 stars."
3,A Good Read...But Not Without Some Problems!,"This was overall a good read. What kept it from being a ""Great"" read was the fact that the reader might feel as if they have come into the middle of an on going story between our two main characters Olivia and Davenport. As a result their romance was a little less than full-filling since this reader felt as if she had missed out on something important with their past interaction.This read was peppered with very good chemistry between Olivia and Davenport, a mystery surrounding a family heirloom that has a particularly nasty curse attached to it, and a search for Davenport's younger brother. Combine all of these aspects and you have a very good read.I recommend this book but suggest that if you are new to Ms. DaRif you might want to pick up her first book ""The Tiger's Mistress"" as I feel that some of the missing pieces may be found here. I know that I will be picking up a copy none the less.Official Reviewer for www.romancedesigns.com"
1,Pirated CD - no good!,"This is an illegal CD. DRG has no rights to put this CD out for sale. The audio quality is very bad and it's just another pirated CD of Amália Rodrigues (there a bunch of them out there). If you like Amália Rodrigues or you want to discover one of the greatests singers of al time look for the official releases by EMI Records. They're the only ones with good audio quality. I strongly recommend ""The Art of Amália"", the best compilation about Amália."
3,Why is this one over $30 when same one is listed again around $16?,"Puts out good light, not great. I would not pay over $16 for it. The body is plastic, not aluminum like it may appear in the pics. That is how the end cap push button was broken on my light---dropped, end first, it cracked the threads around the cap. I had to glue it partway together, but now have to hold switch in to keep it lit. Will not buy another plastic body flashlight."
4,Good purchase for amateurs,"This bag has ample space to carry one SLR camera with a lens of decent size. There is room for an extra lens or flash unit under the actual camera compartment, as well as two small side-pouches on the outside, say for keeping extra film. It provides good protection for your camera. I rate it four stars."
4,A fun boxing game,"This game is great. It's not too serious, and concentrates more on the showboating (fun) side of the sport. Tons of characters can be accessed after finishing the Arcade Mode a few times. What I didn't like was the looooong (and noisy) loading times. If you're patient though, you'll really enjoy it"
5,The best game ever,"I own this game and this is the most fun game you will ever play. It may seem hard at first but after a while you get the hang of it and after that it is so fun. The most coolest fart of the game is when you fight the champ RUMBLEMAN. Michael Buffer says""Now the one you all have been waiting for, Rumbleman!"" That is wh I rate this a perfect five star game."
4,Great game!,"Great game! More characters to choose from and lots more unlockable secret characters which adds to the replay value.The controls are easy to grasp and each character is very diffrent has their own special abilities. The downside is each time you beat the game on either arcade or story mode you have to sit through the credits and that takes a couple minutes -- when you really wanna take those couple minutes to see what character you unlocked!Overall it's a great game! I'd recommend it to anyone... provided they have a Dreamcast or even know what a Dreamcast is, really..."
3,Not much different then the first one,"Except of coarse you can unlock secret players(shaq, M.jackson, Bill and Hilliary Clinton) through winning in arcade mode, the game play is the same as the first one, the championship mode is very differnt, altough I would have prefered that you could be able to defend your title after winning it. a minus is that the credits play after you win in championship and arcade mods, they are extremely long!! this gets cumbersome when your tring to unlock secret players.Over all it's an ok game, kinda funny and cute, if you have some one to play it with I believ you'll get more satisfaction from it."
3,very good at times,ther are some outstanding songs but most are just OK. makes great background music for a party or a quite event.
1,Could be much better,"Although, as previous reviewers have also stated, the idea of cards with stories on them is quite unique, the end result is pretty bland. If a writer wishes to showcase his true writing ability, he should probably use some other format. I would not suggest this ""book"" to anyone."
2,It's ok.,"I bought this book in hopes of finding something new and original, but was sort of underwhelmed by the result. The card idea is novel, but not very well executed. About a third of the stories were interesting and worth reading, but the remainder can be skipped."
5,I loved it,"I loved ""100 Spinning Plates."" I read it in one night. Christopher is not the new Sedaris or the new Augusten Burroughs. His shtick is not the wacky, clever (and tired)- ""isn't my life so crazy and aren't I fabulous?"" thing. In fact, he has no shtick. He observes himself and others with humility and does not leave the reader wondering if he is heightening or exaggerating his experiences for the sake of our enjoyment. He writes with honesty and clarity about the mundane and the intimate.The design of the book is simple, a cardboard box with a deck of cards inside. The ""story"" is read in whatever order the reader chooses. This design is integral to the experience of the book, giving the reader the feeling of opening a secret drawer or rummaging around in an attic and finding a hidden box of random, intimate thoughts of a stranger. The story connects or does not connect like our own non-linear memories. The memories we should have written down but didn't. Christopher did."
5,Judging Amy,Please release Judging Amy on DVD. Judging Amy was one of the best shows ever put on television. I miss this show dearly and would love to have every episode on DVD. I am so sorry this show was cancelled. It is so difficult to find anything worth watching on TV. This was a quality television show with interesting characters in real life scenarios.
5,Judging Amy,"Judging Amy is afavorite with me and many of my friends, It is sooooo human.I watch it with alternating smiles and tears.I have been trying to buy the complete series in DVD that is for Norway (Europe)but have not been able to do that.Why is it not in stock at the moment and when do you suppose we can buy it.At any rate I need to say that very few series have been so interesting for me and my friends.We used to meet and watch the episodes on TV together.Sincerely nkake"
5,Disappointed Amy's Not Here,"I came to buy Judging Amy ... I didn't come to check out the price, I came to buy! I'm not sure how I missed the original series, but I truly learn a lot from the reruns on many levels. My son, third year education major, is studying to be a grammar school teacher. I want to give him the complete series for Christmas because the writers of Judging Amy have presented so many creative ways to work with troubled children. (Of course, this son also wants Condorman when it comes out on DVD!)"
2,LOVE THE SIMPSONS HATE THE GAME,"The simpsons game for gameboy was NOT a very good game for game boy color. The characters move to slowly, it takes forever for you to throw a weapon, and you are timed [NOT ENOUGH TIME]on each level. Please do yourself a favor and do not buy this game."
4,The Simpsons Rock,"This is a really cool game that is based on The Simpsons Halloween episodes.there are 8 levels and in each one you are a different Simpsons charactor.In the 1st level you are Bart and your in a haunted house looking for Santas Little Helper.The second has Maggie in the body of a fly.You have to get her to the transporter which will make her a baby again.Its very easy.Then you Marge and you have to kill zombies with a be be gun. its very very hard.In the next your Homer and your in Vampire Burns(Mr. Burns) castle. Its pretty hard.Then you are a Homer-Robot searching for your body parts.its not very hard at all.In the 7th level Lisa walks through the school freeing kids that are to be eaten by teachers. pretty easy.Finally, in the last level your are King Homer(King Kong) and you battle planes and tanks looking for Marge.I hope you enjoy the game."
2,I LOVE THE SIMPSONS HALLOWEEN EPISODES BUT...,"...I don't like this. I'm sorry, but this game sucks. I only gave it two stars, because I like the halloween theme to it, and because it is The Simpsons. I was excited, because it was a Simpsons game boy color game that was based on the halloween episodes, which I love. But, i'm sorry, this game didn't really do it for me. The characters move to slowly. In the 3rd level, where marge has a gun so she could kill everyone, the difficulty level is WAY HIGHER than the 2nd level. It seems uneven. I love the Simpsons, but for the people that haven't bought it, RENT IT FIRST TO SEE IF YOU LIKE IT OR NOT. If I hadn't of rented this, I would've wasted a lot of my money. Spend your money on Super Mario Bros. Deluxe. Now that's a quality game."
2,Way to hard,"The Simpsons Night of the living Tree House of Horror is a game that is fairly close to the Treehouse of Horror episods in a few levels. You start off as Bart, who is armed only with a sling shot. Then you are Maggie that is a fly. Those are the first and fun levels I have played out of the four I have played. Then you are Marge and that is when the game gets incredibly dificult. Matge has to defeat four bosses in that level and then one really hard boss at the end. When you die if you are not at the last boss you get to do the entire level over again."
3,It doesn't...,"Looks like Simpsons fans have to face it. There will NEVER be a truly great Simpsons game. This game is another example of a mediocre Simpsons game at best. The game play is slow. The object of the game is mainly a scavenger hunt which gets really boring, really fast. The most fun levels are the Metal Gear style Haunted Cafeteria Level and the Rampage style King Homer level. The Marge level is okay but its impossible to beat Krusty at the end. The game's graphics are good and the sound is nice too. It is worth a rental."
1,"Dunno why, but this game scared me...","Poor graphics. It's scarily similar to the SUPER-CRAPPY Powerpuff Girls GBC games. It also scared me somehow, in a nightmarish way.Don't buy it. It ain't worth the money."
2,Buy another game...,"I am a big fan of the simpsons,but I'm sorry to tell the world that if it weren't for the simpsons name and if a random hero were in it, nobody would ever buy it. THQ was thinking that if they were going to publish that game, the name would sell even if it's a ... game. Hell, the NES simpsons were better!"
1,.........,"*walks over and looks at game* ""Oh cool! Simpsons! *touches it and falls over, dead* *some1 comes and hauls him off* Person: Don't even think about this game."
3,"A good book, but you may need outside help or supplementaion","I've just completed this book as part of a correspondence course. I found most of the explanations clear and to the point, but there were places in which the author lost me completely. Much of the theory, which should have clarified the topics under discussion, only gave me more reason to ask, ""Why?"" The solutions provided in the back of the book only covered the odd-numbered exercises, and there were absolutely no explanations. Techniques of solving problems is the very foundation of the course. I'd like to see more of this included in future editions."
2,"Poor explanations, poor book","This book explains the absolute bare minimum on how to do the problems. Every problem in a set is a curve-ball type, and with only the odd answers, you never feel like you get enough practice, other than re-doing each problem.(side note)The solutions manual is absolute garbage, the explanations dwell on the most obvious points, then gloss over things that actually need explanations.Unless you really know this stuff, you will need outside help. It's one of ""those"" manuals where it tells you the answer and how to start problems, but every solution will have you scratching your head thinking ""how did they get from here to there?""Only the odd problems are solved, so you're better off with just the crappy book, and hope you have a really good instructor."
5,Mama Afrika in fine form,"Makeba first achieved international fame with her hit Pata Pata in the 1960s. This set of beautiful and varied songs highlights the South African singer's exceptional voice. The title track is a great ballad, whilst Ndiarabi is a funky number with buoyant rhythms and powerful vocals. Other great tracks include the exile's lament I Long To Return, Bambarana, My People and the evocative Serenade Me. There is a very short number called Good Grunge that sounds like a happy jamming session, and the album concludes with the French song Prendre Un Enfant. Miriam Makeba or Mama Afrika as she is affectionately known, is one of South Africa's greatest female vocalists and composers who has consistently produced quality work over five decades. This album from 1994 is one of the jewels in her crown."
3,"Good content, lacking in presentation","I purchased this book as a gift for a mathematician friend. I, myself, am no mathematician and am therefore no authority on the content of the text. My review, instead, concerns the look of the print. While I have no doubt that the content is excellent, I was less than satisfied with the typographical features. While the text was still readable, it was not reset, but has the look of a medium quality photo-copy. This is particularly unfortunate in a mathematics textbook because in some instances subscripts and superscripts become difficult to read."
5,excellent program for adults,I found this program years back and used it religiously to learn typing. I was beginning to learn how to type.Now I can tell you proudly that i am a fast typer with an excellent speed. Just buy and try it. While clearng my stuff I just found the CD today and can not hold the urge to write this review to show Ho greatfull I am
4,Two of the most complex Roberta Gellis lovers inhabit,"this book. Unfortunately, because of the number of years since I last read it (about 10) I have forgotten the character's names. Although the hero of the story has accepted a match with the lady, he suspects her father of treachery and even as he comes to love her, wonders whose side she is really on. His wife, deeply in love with the only man to ever treat her kindly, tries to find a way to tell him she is loyal to him alone, without making him think she is treacherous by denying the bond of blood between her and her father. Both of them must deal with the medieval belief that a birth defect is a stigma of evil as he was born with a club foot. How the two manage to surmount these and other of life's pitfalls makes for one of Gellis's most intriging novels."
4,Well...,"I don;t actually have this game but my best friend who does and I got in big troubnle for playhing it in the middle of the night. I had muy doubts about it at firwt because controlling with the contrroller ewas difficult at first but then agin i am a bland. The game is full of intersting ytracks nad cool cars. Some of them you have to earn. The ones I know are: Forklift: Great car, goes fast, light, get through small places and between cars, hard to control. I know there is a station wagon and a white bently looking thing. There's more, i juist have tro find the,. It's a great game. When you first playt it it may seem hard and you might get frusterated with it but if yoiu saty with it it gets better. Good gaming."
3,Not the best but...,"First let me say, read my reveiw for Cruisin' World. I won't say this game isn't enjoyable or that it has bad graphics. However, I do believe that Cruisin' World is better. I rented this game after looking for Cruisin World and finding that they did not have back in at Blockbuster yet. So I rented it thinking ""Okay it's probably just as good."" The problem is, the courses got tiring, the music was as well. And the entire game got an average of three stars because the second of the three, Cruisin' WOrld is the best!"
5,Slightly better,"This game isn't a big step up from Cruis'n world, da track design and music are both basically da same, but da places r different, cars r different, and when u push da ""A"" button twice it actually makes u go faster dis time, in Crusi'n World, it actually slowed u down more, and da graphics are a hell uv a lot betta, so overall dis iz betta than Cruis'n World, and way betta than Cruis'n USA, so if u like n e of da first ""Crusi'n"" games, than dis will probably be at da top of ur list. Also, if u like it in da arcade, they've changed it a little bit from da arcade, so its better. Get da game man, its awesome."
5,TERRIFIC FOR BEGINNERS!,Get a ball!! Buy this DVD. It is fantastic!!! Make sure you buy a ball according your height.
4,"Some good exercises, some not so good",I am a beginning stability ball user and bought this DVD to show me some ways to use the ball. I REALLY like the moves for the lower body. I could feel it immediately and know I'll be sore tomorrow. The arm workout was okay but nothing too challenging. For whatever reason the ab workout hurt my lower back too much so I skipped that part. I admit I haven't finished the whole DVD but may just stick to the lower body moves. Just for those it's worth the price.
5,New to Fitness Ball Exercises,"I found this workout to be challenging and effective. I'm new to fitness ball exercising and each time I've worked out with this DVD, I felt it the next day! It's easy to follow, easy to keep up with and the instructor keeps you motivated. I would recommend this DVD as a starting point to anyone that is new to fitness ball exercises."
1,Wouldn't buy it again,"This video covers several basic exercises you can do with an exercise ball. I don't care for the woman who does it -- I find her personality a little annoying. That aside, there is no way to do the exercises straight through without title segues between each position. This makes for a long workout with too much rest between positions. It's nice the first time through because you are just learning. But I would have preferred an option for a traditional style video without titles and intro descriptions for each position."
3,decent workout,"I got a good workout with this, but the instructor wasn't good at cueing, especially in the warmup. After doing it a few times though, it doesn't matter and you can go right along with her."
4,Good basic program,"I like this program. It is a great introducton to the ball, including proper use. I'm a beginner exerciser so this was perfect for me. I see myself being able to master this program and move on soon, and this is a good thing! Build your confidence working out, while getting in shape with this easy yet effective program!"
2,it's okay,"I just used this tape the other day. The instructor does a good job of explaining things, and they do spell out what you are doing very well. The only thing I didn't get out of it was a good workout. This would be fine if you are a beginner or are new to exercise, because it is helpful, but if you are used to working up a good sweat or feeling like you've really gotten a good workout, I didn't get that from this tape. So I would recommend for beginners, but not for someone who's done this for awhile."
4,Once a great singer...always a great singer.,"By the time Johnnie Taylor's ""Real Love"" CD was issued in 1994, the veteran Soul singer was well past his prime (commercially) but he still sounded as great and as compelling as he did during the 1970s. What makes this CD eminently enjoyable, however, is that the choice of material is perfect for Taylor. Earthy, heartfelt, soul-stirring Deep Soul and Blues are where it's at and Johnnie Taylor sounds totally at ease on this set. ""Real Love"", ""Back Street Love Affair"", ""Lady Soul"", Too Much Week At The End Of The Money"" and a rousing remake of The Staple Singers' ""Respect Yourself"" are all good reasons to buy this CD."
3,Not the best...,"This book has some great stories and incorporates necessary pieces of history. That being said, the chapters are a little scattered and long. Many of the points Takaki wants to prove could be done so in much less print."
4,What Takaki sums up in a mere six pages.,I loved the book. I am however quite surprised to find that such an articulate author would only discuss Italian Americans in a few short sentences on aprroxiamately six pages. My family and other Italian Americans broke their backs and endured predjudice to the tenth power in America and there whole story is practically deleted from this text as in History to this present day. Hope he mentiones us in the revised version.
1,Completely worthless,Takaki's book is a wonderful example of how history should not be written. Takaki's attempt to portray a multicultural American history is weak and he accomplishes the opposite. He consistently describes every ethnic minority that has helped create America as nothing more than a victim of white aggression. Indeed the multicultural history of America is more complex than the simplified story of good and evil that Takaki tells. If one wishes to get a glimpse of realistic multicultural history I recommend forgetting about Takaki and instead reading Gary B. Nash's brilliant essay The Hidden History of Mestizo America.
1,HORRIBLE!!!!,"I hated this book. Needed it for a ""multicultural awareness in education"" class. It was boring, hard to follow, difficult to understand and written in some sort of ""language"" that only Einstein could comprehend."
4,pretty good,"I had to read this as required summer reading by my history class. At first I was dreading it because it was over 400 hundred pages, but this book was pretty good. It provides an overview of America's multiculturalism by outlining personal experiences of various ethnic groups. This book is a collection of truths and shared experiences from labor movement, industrial employment, racial discrimination, and betrayal. This book is a very truthful and honest account of who we are and how we came to be. It informs you how America struggled to create a democracy, how various minorities struggled to close racial gaps, and how they labored for freedom and equality. This book was interesting and informative. I finished it faster than I expected."
2,Not recommended,"The binding is thorn and the pages are strewn everywhere. The book is in a bad state by the time it got here. If I glued the pages back, I won't be able to resell the book again!"
1,wrong edition,When I shopped I selected the last edition of this book( the one looks like in the picture) but they sent me an older edition (with the white background). I am missing 3 chapter because of that. So be carefull. I already started late to this class so couldnt hassle to return it and wait again. Bad service.
5,excellent service,the book was received in perfect condition in a timely fashion. I am very pleased with all of the service
1,I Victim's Mirror,"This is a history of violence in America. While, tragically, the violence portrayed here is largely accurate, this book is a serious lie of omission. The author has conveniently left out any and all acts of kindness, compassion, or cooperation between races.If your goal is to inspire, validate, or maintain racism, then this is the book for you. If your goal is to heal our country, then stay away."
4,Great Read,I originally bought this book for my Humanities 121 class about cultural divercity. I was not prepared to like it since it was for school but I am going to keep this book for my own library. I would recommend this book for anyone who is in school or not.
4,Book for school,This is a book i got for my history class at san jose city college it is really good book.
2,"some good kibbles and bits,just don't try to swallow the whole thing","If the words ""philosphy"" and ""intellectual"" have any negative conotations to you, you might not like this book.Watts has no respect for the faith of the common man."
4,kept my intrest,"I normaly would not read this type of book,but I found it to be entertaining enough that I finished it in one sitting. I would recomend it."
2,Unimpressive; don't buy a book based on it's back cover,"I was excited when I read the back of the book because I had never read a book that combined modern technology (e-mail) with recollections of the past. Well it's not e-mail, it's a Word Document. The first of my disappointments.All of the characters were so self-absorbed that I couldn't find the events in their lives interesting. What was everyone's obsession with Bou? She was clueless and stupid. And I didn't care about the triangles and the anger that ensued.I liked the structure of the book if only the contents were different. The current day writing was the only part that I found enjoyable."
2,Yuppies can write!,"There is a certain type of writing, most often seen in magazines, that seems to admire itself as it goes along. In this book, from the beginning with the baby being born, through the characters who just don't seem to be appealing...it is a kind of ""yuppie literature""...that you read and you ask yourself, ""Why do I not like this?""I am sure Kafka is a good writer. But I found myself disliking this book more and more. It was like meeting a person at a cocktail party who at first seems interesting....but as the evening goes on, you gradually learn this person is not only shallow, but incredibly egomaniacal.I really ended up having a strong dislike towards this book. But I gave it 2 stars to be a good sport."
3,ok if you like darker roast,"Before purchasing this product I had read that it was close in taste to Lavazza...which is lighter in taste and not bitter at all. This particular blend is quite bitter and I did not find it to be ""smooth"" like the description states. This is probably perfect for those of you who enjoy a dark and bitter roast...but for those who want a light smooth espresso without bitterness...I wouldn't recommend it...It really just comes down to preference."
2,nothing new here,"This is a pretty basic track. A decent rhythm, no vocals. Nothing new or exciting. Decent filler early in the night. The bonus track ""Junk Food Deluxe"" is good for a laugh."
4,Interesting universe plan here...,"I really liked this book and am eagerly awaiting a sequel... someday... please? The main character is intriguing, and I hope he learns to get over his feelings of inadequacy. I very much want to see how he applies what he learned to events in his home universe, where he is sorely needed!It is a real shame that this is out of print.This is another universe-changing story; the characters move from their own universe into another where the laws of magic are different. A reference indicates that this is the same ""universe"" as the Ingold books but is otherwise unrelated."
5,The Best - Hands Down,"This show is hysterical. And the characters are lovable. The dialogue is clever, witty, and intelligent. And it makes me laugh. Out loud. No matter how many times I've seen an episode, which is something no other show has ever accomplished.For God's sake, offer it on DVD."
5,Funniest show in years.,"This is my favorite sitcom to watch in reruns this year, but it's on locally at 4 am. The situation is a cross between Family Ties and Roseanne. The parents (Mark Addy, Jamie Gertz) are fun loving & lazy, irresponsible compared to their own kids. Their son (Taylor Ball) is an intelligent nerd with a dumb pretty sister and a much younger clever sister, so to that extent it's similar to Family Ties. But the stories remind me more of Roseanne; at any rate it's just as good as either of those very funny shows."
5,Great Show,"This show was great. For some reason it was not released on dvd in the USA, but was released over seas. I saw it on sale in China."
5,John Doe,"It was a shame that this show only lasted for 1 season - what a waste. Okay sometime the stories were cagey, but you felt for the character John Doe (Dominic Purcell), and you hoped he would get his memory back, and explain how he has his amazing gift. Especially in the last episode, there was a little twist when we find find out that one of his close friends was involved in the set-up.I am only putting this review in, as hopefully the networks may release this as a DVD collection."
2,Danger the Dog Yard Cat,"I was disappointed in this book as book rated for ages 9-12. This book is mostly pictures and a paragraph of reading. I was expecting, based on other's reviews, a book with more information on what she experienced running the Iditarod. It was a cute story, not much information, and the reading level is more the 4-7 year range."
4,Classic ABBA (3.5 stars),"ABBA, the Swedish treasure's third regular album, for the first time successfully weaved ABBA magic. This they did to such extent, that, maybe with the exception of ""Dancing Queen"", songs from ""ABBA"" (1975) are the most popular and most representative for many casual fans of the group. This mostly applies to ""Mamma Mia"" and ""S.O.S"". Other two singles, ""I Do I Do I Do I Do I Do"", which is a great tribute to the 1950's music and ""Bang-a-Boomerang"" end up high as well. The album as a whole, however, is a bit unfocused if rather eclectic, as if the group was bracing for the great strides that came later with ""Arrival"" and ""The Album"", two of the releases that topped ""ABBA"" in both songwriting and arrangements. Still, this is a classicist ABBA album, for a fan worth every cent or penny. It also offers some good neglected tracks like ""Tropical Loveland"" and ""Intermezzo No. 1"""
2,How do you FINISH it???,"I got this game over 2 years ago-and I haven't finished it yet. You ask me why? In the 3rd world, there is a level that comes to a dead end, or seems to. I just can't figure it out. The first levels are fun and Croc is really cute, but that one level is completely weird. If you are an expert gamer, try it and tell me how to finish it! But if you aren't an expert, I don't recommend it."
4,not very exciting,i thought the game was boring but if you like zelda its greatthe first time i played it i was bored if i could return i would i didnt really get very far in the game so maybe theres more to it i dont know i thought it was boring and it wasnt adventourus
5,"sounds odd, tastes good","Liptons has a bunch of these pasta/rice/asian sides. Nacho pasta sound like a gross one, but this side is tasty. Spiral noodles with a slightly spicy nacho cheese flavor are pre-mixed and ready to be cooked in water and milk for 9 minutes. With a steady boil and occasional stirring you are rewarded with a meal-size helping.My favorite Lipton side was ""Roasted Garlic Chicken"". It was very flavorful and I can't understand why it was cancelled when other flavors like ""Garlic Butter"" and ""Taco Rice"" exist. Nacho pasta isn't as good, but it suffices and there are plenty of other good sides as well. Give it a try."
5,One of my favorites...,"This is one of the best novels I've ever read, and being an English Lit major and English teacher, I've read many a novel. I'm drawn to books in which the characters feel like old friends to me and I also enjoy refreshing story lines. This novel gave me both. It's humorous and sentimental. The characters are quirky, yet believable. I had never read any of Ad Hudler's work before, but it made me run to the library to read more from this author (too bad most libraries don't carry his works). Thank god for Kindle! I also loved the dialogue, the love story, the happenstances, the navigation of the main characters' surprising friendship, and the bittersweet ending. Bravo!"
4,Very Good,"Aside from a few rather cheesey puns, this is an interesting and well-produced documentary on the Apostolic Fathers. Stephen Ray enthusiastically hosts this biography and travelogue of Ignatius of Antioch, Ireneus of Lyons, Clement of Rome, and Justin Martyr. Ray is especially suited as host in that it was the study of the Apostolic Fathers that led him to convert from Baptist to Roman Catholic. Traveling to the cities where the Apostolic Fathers served the church, Ray gives us a feel for their world and their lives. Through it, we grow more in love with these heroes of the faith and with the church as a whole. This is an ideal source for a young adults group in order to build this faith with their desire for action and adventure. It is a quality production of a part of church history that will excite Christians of any age - Protestant as much as Catholic. In the end, even the silly puns only add to the charm of this one in a series of quality productions."
3,Not bad.,"Not a bad story; nothing to write home about, but well-written, with good pacing, good handling of the characters (particularly Kes) and few if any typos or other such editing errors. If you need a Voyager fix and haven't read this one, it's a good choice. If you aren't already a fan of the series, this book won't make you one."
5,Fun and fast paced...,"I picked up this book because of the coverart. I thought this story would be about Parris and Torres being stuck alone on a planet, but the story turned out different. Still, it was an enjoyable read. The characters were true to the TV series with some extra depth. Kess really shows strenght in this story. The other species they dealt with were interesting and different than what you usualy see on the TV series. Overall, I recommend this book for Voyager fans."
3,"Split story, split results.",Many of the better Star Trek novels/episodes have a dual storyline. I am not convinced that this is one of those stories.See if you can find the error on page 251
5,ELTON ROCKS THE GARDEN!!!!,"Many of Eltons great songs are on this disc. I just wish BillyJoel didn't sing on Yellow brick road with Elton. Otherwise it'sa fantastic live concert! The dts sound track on this disc, isreally top notch too! This concert is worth every penny!!!"
5,FANTASTIC !!,"This is a jam packed excellent value DVD. The stage show includes 32 live songs with bonus footage. I have the newer repackaged DVD called Elton John Greatest Hits 1972-2000 but it is apparently the same DVD just different packaging. God knows why they do this but WHO CARES COZ IT ROCKS !!!! What really makes this performance extra special is his guests, Billy Joel, Rohnan Keeting, Bryan Adams etc. Song after song after song -- I love it when you recognise and can sing along to all the songs and there is no problem with doing this when it comes to Elton bceause everyone knows his music !!! I highly recommend this DVD -- you'll watch it over and over and over again and never be bored!"
4,"Sound is first rate, video is not","I give this DVD four stars overall with 5 stars for sound and 2 for video. The DTS soundtrack I listened to is first rate. This multichannel recording is as good as a studio recording. All the hits are here and Elton sounds in fine voice ((although I think he gave up the high notes a while back). The backup is first rate. Now the video. It looks to me like a film transfer and a poor one at that. These days there is no excuse for not shooting these videos with High Definition cameras then transferring to DVD (ever see Randy Travis?). I actually found the video distracting at times. You might try getting the audio all set up first, then turn off your TV. Then listen to a great concert."
5,The Rocket Still Is Flying,"Elton John remains as the legend he is today. One Night Only, was recorded originally at Madison Garden in October 2000. For a popular tourist site, Elton John has performed at Madison Square Garden more times than any other artist.The DVD contains well over 2 hours of live performing. Each song in fuller detail than the original. Even dynamic performance with Billy Joel, Bryan Adams, and Kiki Dee.Also included is the bonus video of I Want Love featuring Robert Downey Jr. from Songs From Of The West Coast. A understandable video reflecting a recluse of a promising actor.Elton John has kept the music going for over 30 years. Still, his music remains a staple of the music that is out there today, and that is truly our song."
5,Great Concert,"I love this concert! The picture quality is tops and they even offer the ""DDS"" Sound. this makes it a perfect combonation along with all of his greates hits that play one after the other start to finish! If you enjoy Elton then go for this one. I dont believe you could be disapointed I am VERY HAPPY WITH IT! Bill M"
2,disappointed,"The sole reason that I purchased this DVD was to see the duet with Elton John & Kiki Dee. The duet that I'd seen during PBS pledge drives is NOT the one contained on this DVD. Had I known that, I would not have purchased this."
3,All the hits in one place,I bought this dvd for the surround sound music. The music was good with an exception. The surround was lackluster at best.
3,Too much talking,I enjoyed the dvd but found myself fast forwarding thru the talky bits between songs.I'm not a big fan of artists who chat with the audience a lot and he went on and on sometimes.Also i couldn't believe it when he thought he had to declare that the show was being taped so the audience should 'make lots of noise'.This is Elton John !No prompting should be necessary.
2,"Viewer from Carmel, ME","The audio is great. The video is simply awful. It is not clear at all, like all my other DVD's."
1,Pathetic,"Only an incredible fool would like this album. When he plays Main Offender, a Hives cover, it sounds like he choked a chicken or dangled a baby from a roof like Michael Jackson."
4,Elton John Shines,"The concert is fantastic, with 27 great songs plus the video to ""I Want Love"" with Robert Downey, Jr. I know some people hate that video...I find it entertaining. Two of Elton's guests in this concert are also favorites of mine (Billy Joel and Bryan Adams) and offer great performances alongside Sir Elton. It also was very cool to see Kiki Dee with Elton again! The remainder of the guests in this concert I could have done without, and that is the only negative thing that I can share about this concert. It certainly is a welcome addition to my concert collection, and I very much enjoy the 2 1/2-hour show!"
2,The video quality is yuk!,"The video quality is fuzzy and out of focus, -but it's a great compilation of his best songs done well, if only it were 'watchable', too. Disappointing."
3,Great Performance - LOUSY Video Clarity,"If you've read far enough to get to this review, you're probably aware that this DVD contains a great selection of songs, performed well. As a musician, I have thoroughly enjoyed the caliber of musicianship demonstrated by both Elton and his very capable troupe of musicians. The composition of the shots is superb, as is the editing.HOWEVER, I've watched this on a Hi-Def LCD and was very disappointed with the video quality. It looks like it was shot on VHS. It is quite distracting. If you are a videophile or only plan on watching this on a Hi-Def set, be prepared for very 1990's-looking video. If you can live with that, this is a great set."
3,"Great Show, poor video quality","This is a great concert. The song selection and DTS sound are outstanding. It's too bad the video quality isn't up to par for a DVD. I would still recommend the DVD, but I would not purchase it for my collection"
2,inferior video quality,It is too bad that this dvd has such bad quality video - the camera work is excellent - the audio is great - the song selection is great - Elton & guests are all great - The video quality is TERRIBLE which is really too bad on what could of been a great dvd concert.With todays high tech why they ruined this is beyond.................!
4,still standing,"Elton still has it. This concert features one fantastic song list. Elton's performance is great. So, what is the drawback? The sound quality is lacking. Bummer!"
3,"Good for Elton John devotees, just okay for others","Elton John can't sing the old songs as he once did, so he cranks up the lights and the glitz and the volume. Rather uneven with a series of duets interspersed. Production quality was just okay. One reason to watch this DVD, though, is the brilliant ""I Want Love"" video.Good gift for a devoted fan, but except for the extra video I'd say this one can be skipped."
3,"Good performance, but...","He should also release ""From Russia With Elton"", and ""Live in Australia"" as well. Maybe he'll do somerthing now that the Disney Theater is open in Los Angeles?This would have been great had he put something out similar to ""Here and There"", where the first part was an intimate, ""unplugged"" performance, and the second half was more of a rock show.There should be a video collection from past and present compiled in 2 DVDs. I think it's gresat to see him in the early days doing ""Your Song"" when he really didn't have much money, or some of the live shows he did for TV that haven't been seen in years. Not to mention all the videos he's done since the mid-70s. I remember seeing ""Step into Xmas"" and ""Don't Go Breaking My Heart"" as promo videos. I think having it end with the ""West Coast"" videos would be great. I'm disappointed that they are passing off this show as a ""Greatest Hits"" DVD, with the same cover as Greatest Hits 1970-2002."
4,"Great show, but image quality sorely needs updating","If you're an Elton John fan you'll like this show. Well produced, great songs, energetic with great guests (but not so many to dilute the headliner). Today I popped it in again, this time the first time on my 50"" HDTV and eeesh! The image quality is really lacking. Think VHS at best. The people in shots of the crowd just look like little blobs. Really detracts from the experience. Audio is just fine though. So if you're a picky viewer and looking forward to a total concert experience on a big HDTV, wait for a Blu-Ray release."
5,Elton brings comfort to NYC post 9/11 days,Elton and guests bring one of the most memorable concerts to the screen...Elton loves his audience and they love him..Madison Square Garden is Elton's Home more so then the other performers who have been there regularly over the years.Elton performing in this venue makes this big arena cozy as if you were in a local club and then loads up with some great performances. His band and backup singers charge up the atmosphere so bring over your friends for this and have a ball!
3,Not my favorite,"This was not Eltons best effort, played once and gave it away. Quality of video not of highest quality."
4,Ring that bell Round 2 is here!,"Well the first R2R was a hit! Its wild and wacky boxers, The championship mode and the arcade mode. Well Ready 2 Rumble Boxing: Round 2 is here! It has all new game modes such as better Championship mode, the all new tournament mode ,the returning arcade mode, and of course 11 returning boxers with 13 new boxers and some hidden like Shaquille O'neal, and new arenas. Thr orginal R2R was good but... Ready 2 Rumble Boxing: Round 2 is a KNOCK OUT!!!"
5,SO FUN YOU CAN'T STOP PLAYING IT!!!,I LOVE THE ACTION THE GRAPHICS AND THE CHARACTERS! IF YOU PLAYED THE GAME YOU WOULD TOO.IT IS A REALLY GREAT GAME 2 PLAY. THE ONLY OTHER WORDS I HAVE TO SAY NOW ARE WOW!
2,This ...,I hated this game I got to championship level in 15 minutes. I have not played it multi-player yet so that may make up for its easy to win on-player mode
1,Careful,"The valances seem fine if you know what you are getting. They are unlined and pretty flimsy. They are tab top valances that measure 44 by 15. They are not 85 inches long like Amazon says. They are also not 88 inches long like the PACKAGE says. Also, they are blue and light blue not blue and white. I called Olive Kids directly and they said ""gee, the packages are all mismarked. You can return them if you like."" Of course, I had already bought all the coordinated bedding. I then spoke to an Amazon telephone representative (in the Phillipines) who tried to explain that they are 44 inches long but they ""look like they are 85 inches long."" Oh yes, that makes perfect sense. Anyway, if you want something that matches the bedding, this is your only choice."
1,Bad choice - Valence which comes with the drapes is more dull than what is shown on website.,I got his along with the drapes and it was very short (didn't quite fit my window) and the print was too dull. Didn't quite like the quality of the material also
1,Expensive price but cheaply made. Valance only!,"Wow, this is flimsy for $20 a piece!!!! I have seen better valences at the dollar store. I should have purchased fabric and made it myself. I'm not very crafty, but these are sooooo cheap looking I'm sure I could do an equally good job.It's also only the valance even though the picture shows otherwise. That's a little sneaky. So dressing two windows would cost $40 in valances and $60 more dollars on curtains and they're paper, really, paper thin. Not worth $100!"
3,No curtains--just a valence,What's in the picture is more than in the package. Is only the valence (top part).
2,Spend a Little More and Buy Something Better,"This product was cheap, and in every sense of the word, it shows. While the walls were fairly easy to put up, they are nearly paper thin and don't clean very well.Home Depot has a fiberglass tub surround that is thick, durable, and would look very nice once installed. The price is only double what this 5-piece tub surround by American Shower & Bath goes for and is sure to make all the difference in the world. Now that I've finished remodeling the bathroom, my next project is to replace the cheap shower walls with a better product."
5,Great Item,Easy install and came as advertised. Excellent customer service. Worked with me to identify an additional ClearTouch screen for a new camera not supported on their list.
4,Authentic Mexican recipes,"If you're tired of Mexican food that tastes of pizza and cheese, you are ready for the regional cooking of Mexico. At first the recipes seem austere, but on the plate they are rich and filled with subtle earthy flavors. For the serious cook."
5,Must Have,Diana Kennedy is fabulous. I collect cookbooks and have several of hers. If you want authentic Recipes this is the book. I make her Drunken Bean Soup and her Chiapas Roast Pork among other things. The book was in good condition just as the seller stated
4,My light box,"Product received on time. Fit my desk well and works o.k. so far. The light could have been a little brighter because I am working miniature painting, so many little things I am trying to see. But it will pass until I happen to run into a brighter light box."
5,Light box,This is a great light board...easily portable and light. My son uses it with the Pacon Artist Tracing Paper Pad.
5,Fantastic for transfering drawing to fabric!,"I love my Light tracer! It produces nice bright light without being blinding to look at. The surface of the box does not get hot, so you can work with it for a long time.I use it to transfer my drawings onto fabric for quilting and embroidery, and it works beautifully.10"" by 12"" size does not limit me to that size artwork. It is easy to transfer larger drawing by doing them in pieces. I just shift both the drawing and the fabric, since it is so easy to see through fabric and drawing to re-align them once you move to the next section.The light box is light and stores away neatly. The cardboard case that it came in is sturdy and has a handle. The box is easy to store it away and take it out when you need it."
1,Fox Head Mens Bomber Glove,I purchased these based on good reviews I have seen in the past. My experience however has been rather disappointing. The gloves have seen light duty but seem to be coming apart at the seams. Lots of loose threads. The hard knuckles are seperating. The color is fading. The dye stains my hands when there is the slightest trace of moisture. I might expect these problems for a discount glove but considering the premium price they are a huge disappointment.
5,sweet fox bomber gloves,"I really like these gloves. The color is cool and having ur knuckle protected is a huge plus.You never know when that tree or boulder is @ the corner,,,,, These gloves are awesome"
5,Awesome gloves,"These gloves are the best Fox gloves I have had yet.Although the stitching was a little rushed, all i did to avoid further fray was burn the ends with a lighter.These gloves hold up great against the elements"
4,Good gloves,The gloves are pretty nice. it adds grip to my bars and now i cant stand riding with out them. they look amazing but they are kind of cheaply made. the stitching is good but the little finger tip things started to peel off the first week i got them. but the gloves get the job done.
4,great gloves,"I've been using these gloves for various uses ( Dirtbike/Streetbike/Mountain Biking ) My previous pair held up pretty long before a hole developed in the finger, but given all the different things I used them for I could not fault the gloves themselves. I ordered another pair from Amazon and so far they've been great. Off hardshell knuckle protection and finger protection as well. Good buy overall."
2,"Comfortable, functional, poor stitching is a disgrace","my gloves have disintegrated after a few months of use.the stitching is low quality and terriblebuying thor gloves to try those out, not buying these again.I would like to update review.I actually owned 2 pairs of fox bomber gloves over the last 6 months, I destroyed both to the point that everything fell to pieces, the armored knuckles, the green finger inserts, I tore holes in the palm areas. I thought the first pair dying was bad luck, well stupid is as stupid does.I recently purchases THOR IMPACT MX MOTOCROSS gloves to replace 2nd pair of dead bomber gloves. I cannot explain how much better the thor gloves are in every way; stitching, material, protection, comfort, breathing, looks, the list goes onyou would have to be literally nuts to buy the bomber gloves over those Thor, trust me, save yourself. All these 5 star reviews are worthless until the user has taken the gloves out on at least 50+ sessions."
4,A must-have book!,"Belanger's book covers dairy goat management from the perspective of the small farmer or homesteader. Most issues of dairy goat husbandry and management are well covered, but admittedly the book is missing out on veterinary information."
1,disappointed,"I have read several books on the subject of goats, and this is my least favorite. I prefer to raise animals in a manner that is (reasonably) close to the animal's natural way of life (eg. ""yard chickens""). It seems that this book recommends a very unnatural and expensive method of caring for goats. I am not an animal rights activist, I don't have any problem with slaughtering animals for food as an example, but the animals I slaughter will be as well cared for as possible, including having room for exercise, and a chance to eat natural foods (brush, grass, etc.)"
2,Raising Milk Goats the Modern Way,This is not a book that you need to buy. There are better ones on the market. This writer is hard to follow. He jumps around within a topic. Not all subjects are explained fully. Other books explain everything completely. I think the author just wrote what he wanted to write about goats and not what he needed to write for the reader's learning process.
5,I like rugrats,"My mum bought this game for me and I could not wait to play it - I like it a lot - the graphics are great and look just like the rugrats in the movie - I adore kimi, she is fantastic!! :) buy this game if you like the rugrats"
3,Frustrating and Difficult,"This game was really hard. I beat the first level, but then I lost my password. When I tried to beat it again, I couldn't. I only enjoyed playing the mini games. I recommend this game for expierienced game players."
3,Kind of Pointless,"Rugrats in Paris: The Game is sort of fun, but it gets old fast. Plus, it's hard in a way where you don't want to play anymore because it's really frustrating. Another downfall is the sound effects. They are really irritating, because all you hear CONSTANTLY is Tommy's laugh or Chuckie's gurgle sound, or whatever sound your character makes. It's not that fun, unless you're really bored or you're four."
5,Great Game!,"I love this game, wish it came with the instructions, but I can figure anything out. Thanks!"
2,Dont Buy It For Younger Kids,"Just because its rugrats does not mean its for kids!The rugrat chain of games are exactly the same thing,getting to one point to another but in the rugrat games you cant touch anyone,you have to switch levers in order to get to another piont,collect stuff along the way,and you have a time limit!If this sounds fun your WRONG!As you can tell little kids can not cordinate jumping are automaticaly know you have to touch levers or stay away from bad guys.I have to admit the mini games are fun,but there so short and easy!Dont get this game"
3,R.I.P Eddie Guerrero,"This dvd is not the best example of Eddie. The documentary on him is from a speical on UPN and not really well made. There are ten matches and most of them have been seen elsewhere. Now that Eddie's passed on, maybe WWE will re-release this set with better matchs and a better biography. Its sad how WWE has used Eddie's name on tv to get the heels some real heat. Eddie always promised to steal the show and he delivered. The best match ive ever witnessed him wrestle will not be on a dvd set. It was a house show I attended the year he died a few weeks away from SummerSlam. He wrestled Rey Mysterio in a falls count anywhere match and those two tore it up all over the building. Eddie got kicked in the face with a chair and bleed a gusher. No one knew how he pulled it off. Afterwards he got on the mic and said Dominic is still my son or something to that degree. It felt speical even though it was a house show. Again, a decent set for now but hopefully they'll make a better one."
5,One of the bests? Hell yeah!,"This DVD is a great selection for all of you wrestling and Eddie Guerrero fans. It contains Eddie's life and problems.The DVD has 10 complete awsome matches. 2aWa matches,1ECW match, 3WcW matches, and 3 extraordinary WWE matches. Besides that it has music videos, vignettes, CONFIDENTIAL scenes and some special extras. In review this is a great DVD so buy it.p.s. It is super Cheap!!!!"
5,"Goodbye,Legend,Latino Heat,Eddie Guerrero","as you all know eddie has passed away at the age of 38.I was fourtunate enough to see eddie perform at a life event in my home town about a month before his passing.(not televised) He took on Batista & Randy orton in a triple threat match for the world heavyweight title,although he didnt win he was my favoritepart of the match.I Was Lucky enough to get 3 pitures of Eddie and 1 picture of him and Batista hugging each other.Eddie i know your looking down at the world right now and wondering what people are thinking but theres one thing you need to know.YOU WONT BE FORGOTEN! VIVA LA RAZA HOMES!!R.I.P Eddie Guerrero 1967-2005"
5,Rip Eddie Guerrero,"... His passing Is a huge tragedy to the wrestling world , He truely will be missed ... seeing as he touched so many lives .GRACIAS PARA LAS MEMORIAS !The dvd Is well worth the buy , He put on superb matches and gave 100% every time ."
4,good,"The Eddie Guerrero story is a surprisingly well done documentary of a 17 year veteran who dealt with the demons on the outside, and more importantly, the demons on the inside. It goes on to tell how Eddie overdosed on drugs more than once, and when he got into a near fatal car accident, only to fight back and eventually win the wwe championship in a triumphant victory."
4,A good imaginative novel,"Fortunately, this post-apocalyptic novel doesn't spend too much time telling us how the end of the world as we know it, happened. The first part of the book is a little less fun to read than the last. Maybe because I was trying to understand how the different names for new countries and peoples related to the old. Chicago is Chai-ka-go, etc.The story is very well paced. The post-nuclear fears and Gaean thoughts are well balanced with each other."
5,Miso soup is so easy and tastes so good!,Received fast and it's delicious! My Japanese mother loves this soup. We add ooey gooey mochi to this soup. Thanks!
5,Lovely,Karen Akers is a subtler artist than any other cabaret singer I know. This is a lovely addition to her work.
1,Scratched,CD was not completely not useable it was scratched in the area of the songs I mostly purchased it to listen to.
1,Does not work on Windows ME,"The first message i got when loading this software was...""Partiotion Magic does not work on the current version of windows that is installed. Please install one of the Operating Systems that are listed in the Help File.""Wait till a new release comes out that is compatible with all new operating systems from MS."
4,A Bit Pricy But Does A Fantastic Job,"Partition Magic 5.0 is by far the best partitioning utility on the market. Creating, resizing, or any operation you tell it to do doesn't take much time to complete. I have to admit, it is somewhat expensive, but does a nice job!"
3,Treat with caution,After joining several partitions into one I was left with not being able to uninstall many of the programs on the hard drive.
2,An over-rated Product,"When everything is fine, this product will work fine. Any slight anomaly will bring it to its knees. PartitionMagic 5.0 is relatively useless on my machine. It crashes on startup with an error 116. To add and remove partition, I now use fdisk and cfdisk under Linux. I attempted to use the DOS-OS2 version and the Linux version with no success. This is relatively expensive product with quite restrictive licensing terms. It should be able to weather a few storms. My advice would be to learn a little about partition tables and use FDISK. It's free!"
4,Not entirely stable... and reliable?,"PM 5 isn't something to run away from, but it's most certainly not a bang for your buck. If partitioning a HD makes you nauseous, you better download the trial version to see how it works. If partitioning is something you start your day with, PM's the first thing you should think about. It partitions on the fly, no doubt to that, but it also uses terms and concepts that may be a little unfamiliar to untrained eye/ear. Not everyone will feel comfortable using it... If you know what you're doing, take it... if not, don't try this at home. :)"
4,Two Women review,"Excellent book, pulls in the cyber world, a mistress, murder and rich people. Interwoven very nicely. Several unexpected twists and turns."
4,I need This book very urgently.,"I deeply request you to please check about this book ( Rubber, resins, paints and varnishes, (Industrial chemistry)) and i need it very urgently. please let me know on my mail address As rajatloomba@hotmail.comPlease take this matter on urgent basis,Best regards,Rajat Loomba"
3,Okay Condition,"I purchased this book with the understanding that it was is good condition. Overall this was true; however, the last page was ripped and had been taped back together. Other than this this was a wonderful purchase. This book is excellent for exposing children to a different culture."
2,Raven,Raven the trickser wants to give people the gift of light.Raven gives light but you have to read the book to find out what else happens.
2,Compact powder,"This is a neat product, but I'm not happy because I ordered a color and it turns out to be almost white! So, I'm not happy because I can't use this at all!"
2,Why bother ?,Get MAME32 on the windows platform. It runs the actual arcade roms you knew and loved from the '80s - AND IT's FREE!Currently is emulates about 1400 old arcade classics.
1,Federal Funds 2005 Express,"Oh boy, what a mess. The three ring binder is comprised of photocopied pages of government reports, which by the way was mostly by the FBI and related to how law enforcement agencies can get grant money. The list of grant sources that was to be included was in alpha order which would have been fine except they forgot to include the alphabet from A to K so the thing started with letter L.Save your money and use your internet search engine."
1,Very Disappointed,"I was so excited to receive this as a bridal shower gift until I began looking closely at the book. The book has a bunch of 'index' pages where they show a quick reference to the receipes; however the page numbers are WRONG! Obviously the quick reference doesn't help at all. So if I finda recipe on the quick reference page, I have to flip to the back of the book and try and find that same recipe and luckily the back of the book has the correct page. It's a huge mess up - they obviously updated and re-arranged their recipes and forgot to change the page # on the quick reference pages throughout the book. Very disappointed - wish I could return."
1,Bland Old-Lady Music,"Having been a fan of the first Pure Moods CD I thought I'd pick up the others in the series, and the first I bought was this one. What a disappointment! The original Pure Moods disc had been unusual pieces of music from around the world, including movie scores, techno, orchestral, and others -- usually with the only theme being that they created a pleasant 'mood' of some type. Pure Moods 4, however, seemed to me to be just a bunch of hippie-pop. Every third song is another Sarah Maclachlan piece! (Okay, okay, maybe that's an exaggeration, but I have a distinct memory of listening to the disc, and repeatedly going, ""Good Lord, who made this awful song?"" And every time it would be Sarah Maclachlan *again.*) There was but one good song on the whole disc, the Chocolat theme as I recall, and not even good enough to bother keeping the thing on my shelf. This went to the Used CD shop first chance I got."
2,Glad I didn't pay full price,"At the extremely high price of $18+ for this CD, I'm sure glad I went with a re-seller for $8.00. I have all the other Pure Moods and find the music to be both soothing and interesting, but there's nothing new in IV and in fact I'd say the selections are not up to expectations set by listening to the first three."
3,"Good CD, but Not Worthy of ""Pure Moods"" Name","My husband & I love new age/instrumental/meditation music. When we got the first Pure Moods CD, we were floored. We loved it so much we bought a second copy so we could have one in the car all the time. We went on to buy music from many of the artists on the CD.Well, this CD is nice - it's a welcome addition to our collection - but it's not one of my favorites and it's certainly no where near as good as the first. I'm not sorry I bought it but it's not one I'd rush out to recommend to others."
3,"Good CD, but not really a Pure Moods CD.","When I bought this CD,I had hoped it would have been more likethe other Pure Moods albums. I must admit that I was a bitdisappointed. The first few songs were really great, butthe other music was a bit dull and uninspiring.I'm glad Ipurchased this CD,however.Those first few song were worth themoney."
3,"Should be titled ""Pure Piano""","I enjoyed the first three installments of the ""Pure Moods"" series so I was looking forward to this latest compilation. However I was disappointed with the majority of songs being slow piano ""recitals"". I love piano music, but I expect a vast variety on ""Pure Moods"" much like the broad spectrum of music given on the first two recordings. While listening to the music I felt many of the songs were just thrown on for space. There a few really good songs on here marred by the remainder of the CD being more sleep inducing than relaxing. I would skip this one and go with many of the other finer New Age recordings and compilations available."
5,GREAT SYSTEM,"I love this product. It worked very well for me.. Had trouble finding studs with stud finder, but once I found one, It went smoothly. I've changed the configuration a few times since installing it. It is so easy to change to what ever your need is at any given time..The units are well made and hooks and snow board holders and bike holders work very well."
1,Ehhh...,By reading the other reviews of this soup I was expecting something amazing. It was just ok. Not very flavorful at all. I thought I was ordering Hot and Sour soup. It wasn't hot. It wasn't sour. It tasted like chicken stock and not much else. I wouldn't recommend it.
2,Poor craftmanship,"I'll start by saying that apparently these must have been sitting around for awhile in storage as they arrived covered with dust. I wonder how long it would have taken to clean them before shipping and in my case then, why was I paying for handling? The worst disappointment however was that two of the flanges on one of the items were bent to the point of causing the paint to crack and peel, thus exposing the raw metal. But wait, there's more. The glue used to secure the ceramic portion to the metal flanges had oozed and was clearly visable. I did not contact the sender as it would be inconvenient to return and I had already been inconvenienced enough. They are not worthy of mounting inside my house so my only recourse is to mount them outside were they can rust and give them the exposure they deserve. I will not purchase nor will I recommend NOVICA in the future."
2,Roger Cannot Dodge Uneven Material,"Roger Daltrey is a defining vocalist in the history of rock music, but this second solo effort - released in July 1975 - failed to have the spark found in his incredible work with The Who.Produced by Russ Ballard, who also plays guitar and keyboards, two singles were each issued in the USA and UK, with the American release of Come And Get Your Love doing the best, limping in at #68. The song - with a different B-side - did not chart in the UK.The CD includes an outtake of Dear John and an alternate version of Oceans Away.The album cover is a standout in this era of incredible artwork. But the music paints a picture of an artist who cannot rise above the uneven material he must interpret."
1,Don't Buy This,"This is by far the worst solo album of any members of the Who. Daltrey's vocals are fine, but the songs are very lame. If you are interested in a good Who solo album, buy Entwistle's ""Whistle Rymes"" or Townshend's ""Empty Glass""."
5,Simplemente lo mejor,"MEXICO, D.F. Mexico Después de haber conocido la música de The Who, estoy seguro de que este album es el mejor que hayas escuchado del vocalista Roger Daltrey, sobre todo porque la música y la energía que contienen son realmente extraordinarias."
4,"Good Product - light weight, convenient","This wheelchair back pack is light weight, convenient and just right for carrying small items. It closes with Velcro. fits easily over the handles of the wheel chair and folds up with the chair when you break the chair down for transport.We use this instead of a tote bag or a regular wheel chair back pack that I find to be large and bulky."
4,Great product,"I love it, it a bit small, love the orange color inside too. Too bad not enought inside pockets. Just enought for a laptop and a small file. If you looking for something that can hold large file, this is not the right now."
3,doesnt fit,"i really wanted a difference from the messenger bag look. i thought this was perfect but it doesnt fit my hp 15.4, it doesnt come in a 17' in this colour and i didnt want the tan. it's big and the material is not all that classy- it should have been totally in leather or somethign smooth like that. the interior is nice- even my mom liked it....ps the price dropped by $10 just weeks after i bought it.....buy the liz clairbourne instead for 50usd."
5,A wonderful addition...,"I have two sets of these beautiful cups and have given several sets as gifts to others, including my sister for Christmas. They are a wonderful addition to any table. I serve tea in them, and have also used them as dessert cups filled with chocolcate mousse, served with a biscotti or mint stick.They are a little small, but this just makes them seem that much more delicate. The tea stays in the shape of a heart to the very last drop."
4,Would have gotten a 5 but...,"...the packaging of the hat box is not what I expected...The items shipped well and safely, BUT the most important part of this item is the presentation of the hat box...And of course, it was damaged in packaging and transport...So, I will see how Amazon works that out for me...OK...on to the next thing...The actual item...LOVES IT!!!!!!!These are the most cute and adorable and lovable cups ever...I bought the TEAcups and saucers, and let me tell you they are the size of actual teacups...perfect...maybe not as big as the oversized coffee house cups in use today at all of the hip coffee houses...BUT they are teacup size and perfect...Oh, and the colors pop!!! They are so lovely...I'm so excited to give this as a gift and I think I'm ordering one for myself..."
4,Nice coffee cups. Golden rim not so good.,"Nice package, if it arrives intact. Mine arrived in excellent shape.The cups are not so small as they appear, good for practical use. The colors are classy.The golden rims leave a lot to be desired. Some sections are smeared during production and extend a lot onto the inside and outside of the cups. That's a big minus, although the only minus.Overall, I am satisfied and would recommend this to others."
4,Unique tea cups,"I ordered this set to distribute each cup and saucer as individual Valentine gifts to my six daughters and sisters. When filled with liquid, the liquid shows a heart shaped interior. Although they do hold slightly less than a normal sized tea cup (about c.), they were perfect gifts especially when I filled them with chocolates. Unlike some other reviewers, mine came safely wrapped in a lovely keepsake box. I was so pleased with them that I ordered the mixed colored platinum rimed set to give to my young granddaugher for tea parties. Although these also arrived safely in a keepsake box they are smaller than the cups in the pink gold rimmed set and only hold cup of liquid."
2,This is the true story of a country coming apart at its seems.,"This would have been a fantastic film. It accurately depicts the state of American culture: the love of realty TV, the callousness of our fellow Americans, and the emptiness of our president it is ironic this is the downfall of this comedy. It is hard to laugh at what we know to be true . . . more people do vote in American Idol than in a presidential election. And we are too lackadaisical and complacent we are numb to how shameful that makes us as a country. The flix is dead-on; maybe (hopefully) in 5 or 10 years it would have been a hysterical perspective of us in in `00s, but we do not want to see fiction this real right now."
2,"American ""Idle""","Hugh Grant might have been great playing BOTH host AND judge of this talent show, But leave everything up to Seacrest and Cowell as the Head Judge (Cowell) decides who will America pick as their next big star. Overall, this movie goes BEYOND ""American Idol"" as it turns to several other plots-including the President (Dennis Quaid), The Vice-President(William Dafoe), and one of the competitors(Mandy Moore) are in the main plot. Can't tell you what it is; Go see it yourself."
2,American Nightmarez ~ Over Emphasis On Political Agenda Doesn't Make For Good Entertainment,"What do you get when you mix American Idol, George Bush and Arab sleeper cells? Answer: An incredibly silly attempt at social and political satire that insults not only the individuals and factions mentioned above but the viewer as well. The political agenda of this movie was so heavy-handed and overdone. Absolutely ridiculous.Actually the only enjoyable thing about this film was the performance of Sam Golzari as the American Dreamz contestant and potential suicide bomber Omer Obeidi. If not for his presence this film would receive 1 star instead of 2."
1,Failed and Silly Parody,"So Al Qaeda is going to use what passes for American Idol as a weapon. Yeah, that makes sense. How someone persuaded Willem Dafoe to participate in this ridiculous, politically motivated movie is beyond me. Intended as a parody of American Idol, this movie fails to hit its mark and fails to be funny. Don't waste your time. I'm just sorry I wasted a few bucks at the rental store."
2,Dreams With a zzzzz....,"This movie seemed to come out of a contest to work the most current pop culture and history themes into one movie--we get American Idol meets Al Qaeda with George Bush and Karl Rove somehow caught in the middle. American Idol is beyond satire, and the movie isn't really mean-spirited when it comes to either Bush or the terrorists--the most charming character is a failed terrorist who moves to the US to pursue his dream of singing the great American show tunes, only to be pulled back toward his terrorist roots. Somewhere in this story there might have been a savage satire of American pop culture, but American Dreamz wasn't it."
3,Worth A Watch,"I enjoyed this movie more than I expected to. More than just a send-up of currently popular game shows (American Idol is more game show than a reality show, really), the subplots really make the movie. Some of it is predictable - the cold, egomaniacal producer who wants ""freaks"" to make good TV, the cute but ruthless small-town girl, etc, but what moves the film along are the parts unrelated to the show - the president of the US coming into his own, the failed terrorist turned contest.The actors seem to be having fun, the movie is easy to watch and I wouldn't mind seeing it again. The extras are a little much, but occasionally interesting."
2,What were they thinking?,"A horribly executed satire piece that is boring from its start to its ridiculous finish. The humor is dry and the acting is poor, I can't believe Hugh Grant would sign on to an atrocity like this considering the direction of his career as of late. I gave this 2 stars only because of Dennis Quaid's very humorous and satirical portrayal of the American president, it's a shame that his was the only performance in the film that made me laugh. With the country's current take on both President Bush and American Idol, the concept of this film is good from a pop culture standpoint, unfortunately better screenwriting may have made a world of difference for this disaster."
1,Rent only-do not buy!,I was so disappointed in this movie. It is very clunky and not very funny. Maybe it was because I had such high hopes because I loved American Pie and About a Boy so much. Thumbs down!
3,Slightly bitter taste,"I'v enjoyed many films by Paul Weitz and his brother Chris. They generally display a certain sensitivity and and maturity that I like. I understand the reasoning behind the attitude of the story. But the approach is a bit too cynical for my tastes. This is a well made film, with great acting/actors. The overall mood was just a bit depressing."
3,"quirky interesting idea, poor execution","aside from my dislike of hugh grant and mandy moore's poor performance, i did find this movie entertaining, the ending did leave me wishing they'd developed the script a bit more, didn't quite hit the nail on the head."
2,just ok,"American Dreamz trys to be American Idol with a Political Agenda on the Bush Adminstration which in itself goes all over the place&never provides Entertainment. Hugh Grant is a Actor who pretty much Hit his peak well over a Decade ago&His take as Simon from Idol is rather just there. Mandy Moore is ok nothing to say more than she may be a Bit player as a Actress at best. this film takes on so much to be a Satire,but it ends up with more questions then any answers. too long&overblown. William Defoe was trying to Look like Dick Cheney but ended up looking more like Henry fonda. Dennis Quaid was channeling George Bush with mixed results. just a ok film."
2,"American Dreamz.... ""How to make a movie that will put you to sleep""","If you are expecting a fictionalized versison of ""American Idol"" - you will be very disappointed. Actually, except fot the editors of ""Entertainment Weekly"" (who unbelievably gave it a ""B+) - everyone will be disappointed.a few other points-- If you are a fan of George Bush - I am sure that there are still a few of you out there - you will HATE ""American Dreamz"". The entire movie runs as a poorly made SNL skit. Randy/Dennis Quaid is so over-the-top in his role of ""W"" that it loses all of its humor.- Hugh Grant .... what was he thinking? Maybe you can name a worse movie that he has been in- but I can't.- Think of a very poorly made ""Naked Gun"" - you know the ones with OJ.Final assessment - see at your own risk."
1,A dark ending to a slightly boring film.,"The ending of this film was like something from a black comedy--it was very dark and not very funny. It did not match the rest of the film at all.'American Dreamz' is a spoof on the Bush administration and the TV show 'American Idol'. The spoof of 'American Idol' is only tepidly amusing at best, and the spoof on Bush never really takes off. Dennis Quaid, as the president, has nothing to work with in the way of clever dialogue and comes across as boring and inconsequential rather than inept or funnily stupid.Mandy Moore's character is more realistic, but not very likable. Sam Golzari's character is the most entertaining of the film, but not for the runtime of a full-length movie. Maybe if this had been a sketch comedy instead of a feature film, I would have liked it better."
3,You could dream better.,"It has some laughs, it has pretty females, it has some good music, it is entertaining. I guess that it is what most of us would want from a movie. It is not really a movie about American Idol if that is what you were expecting. More of just a fun parody of singing contests. Best singer is Mandy, probably best actor too. Light entertainment, and as long as your buy is cheap, you can't lose."
4,"""Press here to explode yourself.""","Biting, incisive, and honest satire of America, Americans, and...terrorists. Much more nuanced than the low-raters would have you believe, South park subversion meets amiable Airplane slapstick for a 90-percent-brilliant humility-fest. A dreamZ come true for anyone who reads The Onion or watches The Daily Show. ""Placebos? But aren't those illegal?"""
2,Wanted to love it and couldn't,"Great concept, lots of potential, just didn't pull together all that well. I liked it, but I really wanted to love it and just couldn't. Seemed choppy and disjointed, and for this type of film it should have flowed much smoother and had the laughs more consistent. It was pretty flat until the last 20 minutes, when they pull all of the stops and go for broke with great results. Hugh Grant was fabulously smarmy, Chris Klein played the patheticness of his character to the hilt, and Mandy Moore's shrieking was like nails on the chalkboard. Loved the terrorist addicted to showtunes angle, and yes, everything in this movie was a prime target for lampooning. Amused as all get out that people felt the need to walk out of this film."
2,I fell asleep,"I am a huge Hugh Grant fan...but even his presence in the movie couldn't keep me awake! It's pretty slow moving, un-engaging, and really just not that funny. If you're going to watch this, get it on PPV for $3.99!"
2,Funny lines.,"It had a promising storyline, but unfortunately thats all it has going for it. To me the whole movie seemed like it was in a rush to finish. The scenes were quick, and didn't have enough material for it to go anywhere. One second your seeing the auditions and the next the finals are there, it really is that quick. For a comedy I fount that all comedy was lacking from the movie, I laughed a couple times tops.The whole movie was a disappointment, it either tried to hard or didn't try hard enough, whatever it was. It didn't work."
2,A waste of nearly 2 hours,"I'm a huge Mandy Moore fan & I had such high hopes for this movie when I first heard about prior to its 2006 release! I purchased this earlier this week at Wal-Mart and just now got around to watching it... Now I know why it took me so long to get around to buying/renting/watching this movie :(It really wasn't very funny... stupid is more the word for it. The acting was good, but it's too bad the script sucked.2 stars for at least casting great actors (for a horrible movie).I'm glad I only paid $5 for it at Wal-Mart."
1,Not recommended,"This lock didn't open every time I used the correct combination. It would only open some of the time. Further, because of the design of it, reading the numbers if the lock is positioned higher than eye level is nearly impossible; the bulge of the sphere blocks the numbers and lines.Although it's nice that it includes keys to open it, I don't recommend this lock at all and had to return it."
4,Combo lock with key,"This is perfect for my middle school age child. I don't have to worry about her forgetting the combination, since she has the security of using the key."
4,"Great Lock, But HUGE.","I loved this lock, the key idea in the back is amazing for me since I sometimes forget the combo's, Having so many to remember.When I got it in the mail I was surprised on how.. BIG it actually was. But all in all.Really great product."
3,Too bulky,This one is too bulky for a gym locker. It's also heavier and the combination is too complicated to use. I am returning the product.
5,Best lock for dummies,"I avoid combination lockers because It generally takes me 10 minutes to open them correctly; recently I got a locker that would only accommodate a combination type locker so I bought this. When I opened the package I thought I would see how long it would take me to open the lock. It was foolproof, the numbers are big and it glides easily. I opened it within seconds just like a normal person! I was overjoyed, the best part is that if I forget my combo I have keys. I love this lock and will stay loyal to it forever and ever. I don't understand why anyone wouldn't love this lock."
4,"Great, large, easy to use lock!","This is a great looking lock (IMO). It's easy to use and feels extremely sturdy. The keys are handy for times when you want an easy way of opening it, or are a little more concerned about someone seeing the combination (for example at the gym). In fact, that may be the only downside to me so far - the lock is so large and the numbers on the front are so visible that I feel someone watching from a short distance could catch my combination in a crowded environment. Just something to be careful and think about...I will admit I wish Amazon let you choose what color you get - of the four colors, I would've been okay with 3 of them. I took the chance and sure enough got the one I wasn't so fond of."
5,Looks Cool,"This is such a good looking helmet. I get a lot of,""Hey, where did you get the Cool helmet? The flames are what sold me."
3,Bought it for a different reason.,"I have no clue what the book is about, but I bought this book because 2 of my friends are on the cover when they were in 8th grade. Its going to be a good laugh when I receive it."
1,For Mid-Teens,"This book immediately starts with the hard stuff, reproductive organs (male and female), but at a juvenile. I had a hard time trying to determine at what age a girl would want to read this."
4,down to earth,This book is very down to earth. I bought this book for my girl who will not read anything that is not clear or to the point. She found it very easy to understand and it helped her through growing up. If your a mother who wants to help your child through growing up without having that nerve recking talk by this book. If you still want to have that talk this is a great guide for both parent and daughter.
1,More than a pre-teen needs to know...,"This book started off great - talking about menstruation and birds and bees but got way too detailed for a pre-teen (discussed homosexuality, different types of sex, etc.) If you're looking for an introduction to the topic, this isn't it."
4,I have used this cookbook as much as any on my shelf.,"This is a fantastic book for anyone just starting down the low-carb path. I found the recipes, for the most part, to be varied and tasty. Some recquired time and effort but the result was great. I also found the author's tips and general information to be extremely valuable. Her discussion of the ""vegetable heros"" inspired me to try several new spins on old standbys (yes you can have some vegetables on a low-carb regime). In short I found this book to be a gem and have shared it with several friends. The cream of tomato soup is tres fantasique!"
2,on a budget you can't,The book was not good for us either you can not use this book on a real budget. It has things like deviled eggs with red caviar. I had hoped for a more real people with real children and teens. The book does have a lot of good information on things like cherry tomatoes are one carb each. I found more realistic recipes on the web for free. Sorry I do not usualy give bad reviews but if I went by the things in this book this would be a real diet for our family we could eat only one meal a week.
3,Gourmet delight,"The author's recipes are quite delightful, though they are more likely to appeal to ""seasoned"" cooks than to novices. The average kitchen may not have the ingredients for many of the recipes, though Fran gives excellent directions for finding the best in provisions, and some of the meals, wonderful as they are, would be too expensive for regular preparation.I sincerely hope that, in the next edition, the trendy and boring references to ""comfort food"" are deleted. The constant description of dishes as ""comforting"" became extremely annoying."
3,It is only okay,"This book, has great stuff in it but there in no pictures for you to look at which is a big negative for me and also, even though the recipes are low in carb they are very high in fat. I lost weight by cutting down my carbs but replacing it with food high in fat is not the answer. I chose the Lose weight the smart low carb way by Betinna Newman, when you look at the recipes, you get food, low in carb,low in fat, pretty balanced. Also, the good thing about Bettina's is that it gives the recipes full ingredients/nutrition breakdown."
2,How many ways can you cook meat? Not worth the price,"Pretty disappointed with the cookbook. It really wasn't worth the expense. The low carb diet books (Protein Power and Dr. Atkins) are great with recipes included...this didn't add much. I will try the recipe for ice cream though. The diet is great...lost over 20 pounds in a month...but, really, how many ways can you cook eggs and meat, heavy cream and cheese? The recipes for eggs are truly inspiring (including how to boil eggs, scramble, fry and don't forget..poach). To be fair, there were some weird options maybe worth trying if someone cooked them for you."
2,"Low Carb, But High Fat","When I ordered this book, I was expecting something along the line of high protein, low carb meals with no more than 9-15 grams of fat per serving. I was disappointed to find that a majority of what the book was recommending was 28+ grams of fat per serving. I commend anyone that has lost 60 pounds on a diet, as I have lost over 100 pounds myself, but if you are wanting to look like a model from a fitness magazine, I don't think you will achieve such results on this particular diet. It does, however have some neat suggestions that you could modify to a lower fat version, and could be a very good diet plan if your doctor has told you that carbs are causing medical problems for you."
1,STORE FOR YARD SALE,MY GOODNESS WHAT A TERRIBLE BOOK UNLESS YOU LIKE SOY- FLAXSEED-TOFU-BURRITO MADE WITH AN EZEKIEL SPROUTED GRAIN TORILLA (WHATEVER THE HECK THAT IS)LOL. PLEASE DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS BOOK IF YOU WANT TO USE THE RECIPES- I LOOKED NO FURTHER THAN THE RECIPES. OUT IT GOES EITHER SOLD FOR $.25 AT YARD SALE OR GIVEN TO GOODWILL. IF I HAD FIREPLACE WOULD DISPOSE OF IT THERE.
3,Help!,"I tried to make the little Parmesan cheese crispies that are found on page 126 and had a terrible time. It got all gunky and stuck to the pan. I had to pry it off with a spatular and almost ruined the pan. Has anyone else tried these? If so, please let me know how you did it if it worked well for you."
1,Questionable Health Advice,"Gives a good review of the low-carb, high-protein gurus. However, eating all the protein and fat you want and forcing the body into ketosis is questionable health advice. McCullough leans more toward a Dr. Atkins philosophy, than a Barry Sears (The Zone) balanced protein/carb low, but ""good fat"" approach. She clearly loves her fat and sweet, calling for ""heavy cream"" and ""aspartame"" (Nutrasweet) in many recipes. Nevermind that saturated fat has been shown to raise cholesterol levels (linked to America's #1 killer, heart disease) and Aspartame has been shown to cause cancer in rats (and feed melanoma tumors), you can now use them freely in your cooking if you take the author's advice. Weight-watchers are better off sticking to fruits and vegetables, eating low fat, eliminating sweets, and limiting portions of complex carbs. Perscription for Dietary Wellness by Balch, is a better read."
3,"This cookbook isn't bad, I just think buyer's should beware!","I purchased the cookbook along with the Protein Power Plan book. However, I was very dissappointed with the cookbook because to me and my husband the foods were a little unrealistic for a normal, middle-class family of two. Some of the recipes were things like: Israeli Guacamole; Middle Eastern Lamb Salad; Roasted Swordfish with Herbs; Smoked Trout on Watercress, just to name a few. On a limited budget and in an area where fresh seafood is almost impossible to find the cookbook was not very useful. On a positive note however, I must say that you can get some creative ideas from the book!!"
5,Excellent,"This is the best low carb cookbook out there. The recipes are not about ""convenient substitutions"" but rather about real home cooked food adapted to a low carb lifestyle. I haven't made a recipe from this book yet that I've been disappointed with."
4,Liked it,This cookbook is a nice resource to have in your low carb library. Good variety of dishes to please most folks.
3,The Low-Carb Cookbook,"The format and presentation of this book looks wonderful - jammed-pack with interesting categories. Interesting is the main word here, but certainly not practical. For the majority of the recipes, I would either need to move to the seashore or be very wealthy. Frankly, it's a little pricy to be cooking several pounds of large shrimp and smoked salmon every week (The Lime Scallops on page 199 sound delicious, but where in western Pennsylvania do you find two pounds of fresh scallops?). My advise is, buy this book if you cook for a lot of special ocassions; however, if you're planning to cook dinner every night for your ""meat and potatoes"" man/woman, forget it."
3,Those With Nut Allergies - BEWARE,"As a part of a healthy lifestyle that involves weightlifting and cardio, I have started a low-fat low-carb diet. Upon reading the raving reviews, I purchased this book with eager anticipation. One problem - I am allergic to nuts. It appears that at least 90% of the recipes involve nuts. In addition, if you don't have hours to scour specialty food stores for the exotic ingrediants these recipes require, this book may not be for you. In my opinion, this book is best suited to people who have a great deal of time to add finesse to their meals. Unfortunately, if you are busy or have nut allergies, you should give this one a pass."
3,"Handy, but not a mainstay...","I am fairly new to the Atkins/ low-carb diet plan, but was looking for more variety - this book does offer variety, but as many have said, it has numerous recipes calling for ""obscure"" ingredients. I was looking for a good basic cookbook that can hlep me change my daily lifestyle, not necessarily create award-winning fare - I don't feel this is it. Also, I noticed that she calculates carb-grams based on the Protein Power method of excluding fiber-based grams. Atkins' plan does not allow for this insofar as I can tell, so this may be a problem in calculation for Atkins followers, particularly those on induction diets."
4,Pretty good,"I have to adapt a lot of recipes because I am very insulin-resistant and can't have above 10g of carbs per day, but I was impressed with the variety of recipes and it certainly helps get me out of the ""what should I eat today?"" rutt."
2,Nutritional Information,"The recipes in this cookbook are all excellent. I would have given it 4 to 5 stars but for one thing. The nutritional information provided includes ONLY ""net carbs"". While some believe that you should only count total carbs minus fiber, there are many qualified nutritionists who still suggest counting total carbs. The author does not provide any information on either total carbs or fiber count. Therefore, this book is only useful for those who want to count ""net"" carbs. This reduces the value significantly"
5,Great series,"The series was great. I recommend it highly. But there is no such DVD. David Kelley's series are problematic for DVD because of his heavy reliance on pop music and the problems getting the rights released to the music after first use. When and if such a DVD becomes available, it will probably be well worth picking up."
2,"Eric, your communism is showing","Eric Hobsbawm, as a person with a deeply-held belief (communism) that is opposed to the subject he purports to carefully examine, was unable to overcome his own debilitating point of view and write neutrally on the topic of nationalism. The book is replete with his attempts to dimish or demean the various forms of nationalism, and it is only logical to assume that his animus is due to communism's ultimate denial of national sentiment. To top it off, at the end of Chapter one Hobsbawm hypocritically lectures his audience about the importance of detachment and impartiality in the study of nationalism. So read the book for a quick, interesting overview of various national movements, but always remember that what you're reading is not as scholarly as it claims to be."
2,"Confirmation for Marxists, but not much analysis","Hobsbawn's book is quite over rated as a text about nationalism. Those fellow idiological readers who share Hobsbawn's delight in exposing the ""myths"" of nationalism and nations will of course find it ""brilliant and insightful"", but one wonders if they admire the analysis, or just agree with his conclusion? Hobsbawm's strongly implied conclusion that nationalism and nations are ""on the way out"" means for him that so is war and conflict. But one wonders if for all the faults of nationalism and nations if the institutions and arrangements that replace them will be any better. There was war, slavery and injustice long before the 18th century, whether systems were empires or feudal, so why should the successors of nations be any better. Oh, I forgot if we all think like Hobsbawm ""we can unite."""
3,Mostly semi homemade recipes,"If you like semi homemade recipes, than this book is great. Most recipes call for cake mixes, canned biscuits, canned frostings, etc. The book is very pretty to look through, and has lots of great photos, but the recipes are mainly for beginners. If your into homemade cooking than I would recommend Celebrate by Shiela Lukins."
2,"Mediocre book, sorry.","The seller of this book did any excellent job in packing and shipping, but the book itself is nothing special.For example, for Easter?, it gives a recipe for ""special mashed potatoes""! What's special about them? They used the basics; potatoes, milk, butter, salt and pepper.I like Betty Crocker cook books, but save your money. You can do better than this one."
5,Makes planning a party easy,"This cook book includes lots of pictures (I think one for each recipe) and is separated into chapters for each holiday. It inludes ideas for complete holiday celebrations, from drinks to desert to center pieces and decorations. The ideas are cute and unique. I think adults and kids will have fun with the ideas in this book. I am planning on following the recipe plan for Cinco de Mayo!"
1,Returned,"I wound up returning this after receiving it. The cover looked old and worn and looking through the recipes I didn't see anything good. I was hoping for some good Halloween, Thanksgiving and Christmas recipes, but there really wasn't anything good for the holidays."
3,not that great,"I rented this game the other day not sure how it would be. As it turns out , its fun,but not that great. The graphics arent really up to what they should be.Maybe thats just because I also have a playstation 2 and ever since everything looks much crappier. The overall racing was fun but there wasnt enough modes.Its basically race or race. No freestyle modes. In conclusion , buy a ps2. It will enhance your gameplaying 10 fold, or however you want to put it."
3,This cd is a little bit above average,"This is the first Ralph Sharon cd that I have bought. I have been wanting one of his cds for years, but had put off buying one until now.Well i'm not disappointed. He plays a mighty piano. His trio also, is quite good. The song selection seemed fairly decent for this project. The main concern I had about this cd was the arrangements. I thought they could have been better. I have a huge collection of jazz cds and I would say this cd is about average. I have many cds that are much better than this one.I Would Like To Recommend This CD"
3,Not so good,"The game is not so cool. It's difficult to see things because the background color is similar to the caracter color. Dispite this ""little"" problem, the gameplay is good. I'd sugest Metal Gear Solid instead."
2,One of the Worst Games Ever,"This game was not very good.The box looked kind of cool, but the games graphics stunk. I would say it was worse than Armorines and thats say'n alot. The gameplay was OKAY, and it was kinda hard,so it was okay.If it looks intresting,rent or use someone elses but DO NOT BUY THIS GAME! Though one good thing about this game is hitting it with a hammer or taking all your rage out on it.But for playing it,USE SOMEONE ELSES OR DONT PLAY IT AT ALL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Mostly Strengths but a couple of OFIs,"The book per se, is an excellent resource for understanding the overall Criteria. Further, as a previous reviewer put it, the linkages between categories is worth the price (almost!).A few additional things I would have liked are :1] All the blueprints printed consecutively to be able to see the linkages in one place.2] A more detailed explanation of the Areas to Address. Sometimes it is not easy to understand why certain words / phrases have been used, and it would have been nice if these could have been explained in more detail.3] A separate document (as a part of the software kit) with all the Survey questions that are currently given with each Criteria item. This would make it possible to either email to respondents or print."
5,HARD TO FIND -- BUT WELL WORTH IT!,"I had this book recommended to me, but had a very difficult time finding it. I'm so glad I finaly did. We read it aloud and the whole family loved it (kids 6-15). Years later, they still talk about it as among their favorite books.Warning: it will definitely make you plan on visiting Capri some day!"
4,"fast shipping, item as described.","We haven't read the book yet, but the book is in good condition and arrived within about a week. Thanks!"
3,An Awesome Dance mix,D.J. Disco mix is a great cd that provides a nice continuous disco sound. Buy the cd just to get the awesome star wars disco remix! It's sure to be the talk of the party.
2,"Good, disposable pedal, but save your money","These pedals are of decent quality, but they will not last under aggressive use and are not serviceable. The bearings spin easily, but are noisy and the inner bearing seal is of unacceptably poor design. It not only suffers from poor sealing, but it can easily walk away from the pedal body on the cylindrical shaft, exposing the bearings do dirt and moisture. If you pay the retail price of $90, you have a right to feel ripped off. If you get them for $25, you could have done better with a pair of generic Nashbar cheapos, or saved your money to get a pair of decent pedals. If you ride enough, you'll likely go through enough of these that you could afford to buy a decent set of pedals.Shame on Ritchey for marketing these pieces of junk."
2,A good product sabotaged by its maker!,"The good: Nice open design, tiny, rugged construction, positive clip-in and easy release. Good price if you find them on sale.The bad: SPINDLES ARE STAKED after assembly to preclude servicing, bearings aren't sealed and turn roughly for lack of retainers to space the balls.The bottom line: DON'T BUY THESE. They work okay, but after assembling and adjusting the pedals, Ritchey mangles the threads at the end of the spindle so you can't service the bearings. I bought 2 pair of these and all 4 spindles are staked, so it isn't accidental. Ritchey goes out of their way to destroy the value in this otherwise well-made and functional product. I guess they want to sell you a new pair whenever the bearings need repacking. Shame on them!"
4,Great pedal,"I saw this pedal on a bike and decided to pick it up. I like the minimal look. The weight is not bad either. The forged look is a little on the rough side, but I don't mind- which is why I only gave it four out of five stars. But ratchet bros makes a good product and this is on par with the quality you expect."
1,"So, so, so ,so, so disappointed","I have a wave to my hair if it dries naturally so I blow it out & straighten it most days. I have been using the Glossing Cream which I really like, but thought I'd give Straight Away a try...so disappointing! It does not help make it straighter at all & seems to be drying...won't be buying this again, but I'll continue to use the glossing cream & technician color care shampoo & conditioner. I didn't want to give it any stars, but the review wouldn't allow that so I had give it one."
3,Shape Fitness Series is waaaay better!,"I purchased this CD along with Vol. 2. If you are a Shape Fitness Series fan like I am, you will not like this CD. The ""MIX"" in the title must pertain to the actual song selections because these songs have a definite beginning and ending, some abruptly. This would be good for walking and activities that you don't rely on bpm to help you keep pace. BPM for songs are not listed. The production value is not as clean either."
4,Venus,"I don't know if anyone knows, but this independent film is based on the true story of the late Venus Landin and her lover the late Bisa Niambi who fatally shot Venus three times in 1993, and then turned the gun on herself.Venus magazine was created in honor of Venus by her friend Charlene Cothran of which I was contributor and co-editor. I've lost touch with Charlene but I hear she's no longer a lesbian...."
3,WATERWISE 4000 DISTILLED WATER FOR ONE,"DISTILLER WORKS WELL FOR DISTILLING ONE GALLON TAKING 4 HOURS TO MAKE.WOULD LIKE TO SEE AN IMPROVED GLASS CONTAINER. WHEN POURING,THE LIP ON CONTAINER LEAKS WATER OUT ONTO COUNTER-POOR DESIGN,AS LIP IS NOT WIDE ENOUGH.RETIRED INDUSTRIAL GRAPHICS DESIGNER"
2,Not good enough for dental office,I bought this distiller to use in my autoclaves ay my dental office. It won't get the water purified enough for the autoclaves to accept it. They automatically shut down when the water is not distilled enough.
5,Works great,"This is okay for 2 people drinking faily often, and a little cooking.Does take some time and needs cleaned every 3 months, I got the filters and cleaning solution. I run a couple times after I clean because Im sure the solution is nasty.I only run it with cold tap water, seems to help keep it cleaner longer.Ive had for over a year, saved us a ton and probably 700 water bottles...I would opt for a bigger one if your more than 2 people, or a second. Seems like it will last for years."
4,Good Foundation For Understanding the Catholic Faith,"This was one of the first books I read in my journey that eventually led me to realize the Catholic Church was for me. As a Protestant all my life I needed a reasoned approach to the question of biblical authority and tradition. In the first few chapters I wasn't sure where the author was going and you might not either. But stick with it, underline, take notes. Don't rush through it and you will get a good overview of the topic. I would consider this invaluable for any person needing this information."
5,Best of the Bunch,"There are many, many new books on Catholic apologetics written by former (""I'd rather die than become a Catholic!"") Protestants. This is one of the best! His style is interesting. It could be described as 'point/counter-point' or 'playing the devil's advocate' regarding any new insight. Mr.Shea's logic is impeccable and his reasoning deductible. He arrives at conclusions that one might never gain yet, when presented, make total sense.It's style should not offend any but the most strident anti-Catholic. Even to this mindset, his attitude is open and welcoming. His conclusions are hard to refute because, in coming to these logical ends, he anticipates objections, defines them, attempts to defend the objection, and finally states his conclusion only to begin the following chapter with, ""Yes, but!!"" Highly recommended to Protestants who are secure enough in their theology to look openly and Catholics who want to understand their faith more deeply."
4,By What Authority? An Evangelical Discovers Catholic Tradition,"This is book is a wonderful read and a wonderful apology of Catholic Tradition. If you are interested in reading a good book, this is a great book to read. If you are a Catholic interested in learning, defending and explaining your faith, this is a great book to read. If you are interested in learning about Catholicism, this is a great book to read. If you want to recommend a book to a person interested in Catholicism, this is a great book to recommend."
4,"""Brevity and depth is the language of a wise fellow""","Mark Shea by no means gives an exhaustive review of Sacred Traditon and the Life of the Church, but, rather, gives his Evanglical readers reason and ability to peer at Christianity from outside the box. For those whose eyes have been opened just enough to see a glimmer of sunlight and who are still disgrunted with ""Roman"" Catholic Tradition, I would suggest reading the late John Henry Cardinal Newman's ""The Development of Christian Doctrine"" [New York: Longmans, Green and Co., Inc., 1949]."
5,My beauty staple,"I live in Colorado, where the climate is extremely dry and it's very hard to keep skin from being an itchy dry mess. After trying a billion lip balms, I have to say this is hands down the best lip balm out there. Not only is it SO moisturizing, but it really makes your lips look lovely as well. It brings out your natural color, and gives a glossy shine without being sticky in the slightest. I'm never without this in my bag."
2,Does not last,"I use this product on my lips. It applies easily and does not have a taste to me. The problem is, it does not last. Seems like 5 minutes later I need to apply more and my lips feel dry like I did not apply any moisturizer. The price is good for this product and it does seem to last a long time."
4,Rosebud lip balm,I used this product when I was in my teens and recently rediscoverd it!! It has a lovely rose fragrance and is excellent for a light lipgloss or to keep your lips from chapping.
2,At least it smells good...,"That's all I can really say about this product. I just had to try it after reading all of the glowing reviews and since it's such an old ""tried and true"" formula. Wow. Can we say overrated? This stuff is so overrated that I felt compelled to write my first amazon review about how overrated this stuff is. Its like putting mineral oil on my lips. Its thin and greasy and evaporates into thin air in a matter of minutes. When its gone my lips are left drier than they were prior to putting this balm on. Fail."
5,AMAZIN FORGET CHAP STICK OR ANY OTHER CRAP,"Yes if you keep up with the mainstream you already know this toy if you will. BUT if your like me and don't keep up with Britney or celeb gossip this is an AMAZING for your lips. My if you have chap lips, pick lips, winter, or a blizzard you can guarantee this thing will make your lips look juicy and smooth.Sephora sells this for a lot more since they feel they can do that. If you can get this for 5 bucks or less BUY IT ! (also if it comes with shipping BARGAIN) The next best thing to this is burts bee's. It also works quickly, smoothes lips away and doesnt leave a residue which I hate from chap stick's."
1,Rosebud Salve is the BOMB!,"Rosebud salve is just the best! I have been dying to try it for some time, have heard great things about it.. well its all true! Great on the lips of course but also on the cuticles... its a wonder! Will buy it over and over again. Oh.. love the feel of it on the lips too! Smells great also."
2,Worked good...for about 6 months,"My daughter got this as a gift for Christmas '06 and it worked really well for her for about 6 months. One morning she watched a movie and then put in a new one, but there was no picture. We could hear the movie, but nothing on the screen. I called Polaroid customer service and they were very helpful, however in order to fix the problem (burnt out backlight bulb) we would have to pay $90 for a new one (wholesale price). I know it cost about that much brand new so we didn't get our money's worth for less than 6 months of use!"
1,Polaroid only lasts 2 uses,"I purchased this product 9 months ago prior to a car trip. It worked fine that trip then we used it again a couple of months later - now I have been trying to use it and it started to say ""bad disk"" with most of my DVDs - now it even says ""bad disk"" with brand new DVDs. I called Polaroid & they said that their product only has a 90 day warranty. Clearly they don't expect it to last more than 90 days."
1,Do NOT buy a Polaroid DVD Player,We bought a similar Polaroid dvd player (Amazon no longer sells it) at Christmas 06. By May 06 it was no longer able to play a dvd without jerking and freezing up. We only used it a few times and never mishandled it. Polaroid only offers a 3 month warranty and has lousy customer support - I emailed them 3 times before they finally got back to tell me they wouldn't do anything about the fact that it no longer works after only being used a few times.Do yourself a favor - stay away from it! Would give it 0 stars.
1,Not worth the money,"We got this for Christmas '06, and although it worked fine for 7 months it sure doesn't now. All it says is bad disk or just freezes the picture on the screen. Nice 90 day warranty. Polaroid isn't willing to do anything to help or fix it. DON'T buy a polaroid, they just aren't worth the money."
3,Basic air blocker,"This product is ok if you just want to block air from the vent, but not as a permanent insulated cover. This is my second one, and already after one week, the Velcro is coming lose one side. It's ok to get me through this winter, but I have to find a insulated, permanent one."
1,"Overpriced, unattractive, ineffective junk!","""This product was misrepresented by the seller. The insulation was thin there was no way it has a R-8 R-value. The white electrical tape for the edges, directions or packing list were not included. I can purchase the same material locally for 1/4 the price I was charged! I am very disappointed with this product. Let's now see who your customer service is with the return and refund."""
2,Battic Door -- Attic fan covers,Bought it hoping it would at least help reduce the draft -- I didn't think it would stop it all as the draft can get through the velcro.Pros -- easy to cutCons-- The tape does not stick to the cover. The cover has peeled away twice from the tape (cover found on floor with tape still attached to the fan grate. I am going to try super glue next.-- be careful with the positioning can look wavy or crumpled if you try to put it up to fastI wanted a more supstantial option to remove all the drafts but there are not alot of options on the market.
4,does the job,"This product works as promised, and is easy to install with the included directions. It isn't the prettiest thing up on my ceiling, and I hope to find a nicer way to cover this hole, but my kitchen has been much cooler this summer and it has been very hot here."
2,Hate this cover,"It's thin and cheap. I used a piece of plastic window insulation (the kind you stick up then use a hair dryer to seal it tight). A very cheap alternative, and the guy at my house from Home Depot was impressed with my ingenuity and improvisation. He said it was just as good as the ugly product shown here."
1,Not worth it,Overpriced item: it is velcro with some shiney/flimsy material and electric tape. It looked like a scout craft project. Save your money!
4,Easy to install and helps a lot,"I realize that there are probably cheaper ways to achieve the same thing as this product, but when it comes to convenience this did what I wanted it too and the finished product looks great. Install took about 15-20 minutes. This included measuring, cutting, affixing the tape, and mounting. The tape is VERY sticky, so be careful not to let it touch anything you don't want it to stick too. When I was pulling off the backing I let it touch a part of exposed tape and had to remove and replace that section of the velcro."
3,attic cover,"price was ok nothing great. received in timely manner. works as described. It is a pain to put up reaching above your head trying to get it started straight so it seals correctly, that being said it is better than not having a cover on your whole house fan."
1,Glorified art project,"Lets set the record straight with what you are actually getting here. In the box will be a roll of foil backed insulation, a roll of electrical tape (white), and a bunch of velcro. What they don't tell you is that this is completely do-it-yourself with items that you can buy much cheaper at home depot. You cut the insulation to size, add the velcro and I guess make pretty edges with the electrical tape!? The product is also must less attractive than it is in the picture. Don't waste your money.I've never written a prodect review before, but getting this product just made me THAT angry."
3,Battic Whole House Attic Ceiling Fan Seal Cover,The first one that Battic sent was damaged but I was very impressed with the fact that a real person talked to me and they gave me no hassle in getting a new one; they didn't even want the damaged one returned.The cover itself is only 'okay'; I knew what it was before I ordered it but it's about the only thing in the market that is made for aftermarket replacements...I was hoping to find something more robust but it doesn't appear that anyone including big box stores has anything better to offer.
4,Seems to work well,"The cover seems to work, we'll have to get into deep winter to know for sure. One thing that may be a problem is the velcroe tape used to apply the cover. I'm sure it doesn't actually ""seal"" the opening. But it sure beats nothing at all and it was fairly simple to install. A bit pricey though."
4,"Good product, poor documentation",This closure requires trimming and installatiopm pf velcro tape.It also comes with white vinyl tape to put on the edge.If you are going to do this you you will need about an inch on each side beyind the velcro.Alos the white electrical tape stretches and you have to apply it without thsi tension of you put it on the edge. Otherwise the remaining tension on teh tape will either pull it off or curl the cover.I had to remove the edge tape becuase I did not leave enough room to apply it and applied under tension.
5,CLASSIC PERFORMANCE,"If you've got a taste for Sandra, it never got any better than this. To have seen it live back in the 80s in New York City was a lucky break for me but this recording is an amazing record of that event.Through the years Sandra has been frustrating, arrogant, angry, dismissive, contradictory and even tiresome. I'm sure she would be happy to accept all of that but then again, who cares about her offstage? One should appreciate the work and there is so much to enjoy here.This is theater, this is performance, this is perfection.Truly a comic masterpiece."
4,"""Oh mi GOSH... there must've been dust, on those mints!""","As audio needs to deliver imagery and laughs through voice alone, this recording turns out to be more refined and vivid than the video of the same name. The pacing is slower, yes, but the setup is more succesful, and not rushed as in the movie. Bernhard tries on personalities and develops entire scenarios that revel in a jaded non-mainstream view of the cutlture. It should have panned out for her, but the culture was in a dumbening trend that still hasn't peaked, and few can handle her challenging material, or her signature bitterness"
4,Great southern soul belter,"One of the few older southern soul singers still recording, and when you listen to her you will understand why. This woman is a powerhouse, not only does she pen most of her songs, but her delivery is steeped in blues, r&b and Stax soul. She has a few of her signature in your face sassy soul numbers of no good men, and those who, shall we say, do not deliver the goods. But also sensitive ballads like Child of the Ghetto. Lasalle has a strong, husky voice without any of the histrionics of some contemporary soul singers. For those who like retro soul why not try the real thing."
1,nada,"well, so far i have got that box that says no connection. I have not been able to watch any rentals."
3,Coulda been good,"I vacillated between I don't like it and it's OK when marking stars. Not sure what exactly the film makers were trying to achieve with this presentation. There was some interesting content buried in ""shock value"" editing. People investigating seemed sincere and competent enough, what could have been viable and interesting evidence spoiled by the choppy, over dramatized presentation. Hard to figure out chronology of events, evp's and other possibly ""real"" evidence."
5,Terrific throughout,"I've been a fan of Heinlein's work for a while, so I snapped this book up as another chance to read some of his work.Rather then a novel this is a collection of his short stories that, though on the surface may not seem to be, really are related.Through subtle nuances that other authors leave out, he makes these stories engaging, thought provoking and thouroughly relavent for every generation. Telling the tale of a history yet to come, these stories travel the road of immortality and the way human life changes the universe.One of his best works, though usually overlooked. A real gem for anyone that enjoys great science fiction or a fan of Heinlein's other works. Never a dull moment, you'll find it hard to put down."
5,Some of his very best,"I have reread this book at least ten times! After reading over half of Heinlein's work, it is still my favorite. Definitely worth buying if you can find a copy."
3,A Little Disappointed,"This is a collection of Heinlein's ""Future History"" stories, set in chronological order by story. Some of these were boring enough to make me want to cry rather than read more... others were much more interesting. The real disappointment of the book was the novella bit in it, ""If This Goes On---"". It had terrific buildup, a good protagonists, then fell flat on its face with a mundane and boring ending. I'm rating the book low, simply because the few gems, while shiny and good, weren't worth reading the duds for. Not recommended unless you are a die-hard Heinlein, hard sci-fi fan."
1,"I COULDN'T GIVE ""0"" STARS","THE ""ANTIQUE BRONZE"" IS BROWN PAINT. THE ARMS PLASTIC. ONE SNAPPED RIGHT OFF. IT WENT RIGHT BACK. I WOULD LIKE TO ADD HOWEVER, THAT THE CUSTOMER SERVICE WAS EXCELLENT."
5,Hot Swedes From the 70's!,"You have to have a ""certain"" constitution to stomach this.............FUN MUSIC (You thought I was going to say crap, right?) I'm not here to tell you how to live your life - but if you can't let your hair down (IF you still have any) every now and then, then you're in NEED of some serious Psychiatric help! Voulez-Vous...U-Huh!"
3,GOOD BUT COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER,THIS TRADE PAPER BACK A REPRINT OF PWJ ISSUES 6-7 WAS ABOUT THE BIGGEST SELLING COMIC OF ITS TIME !!! ONLY REALLY BECAUSE ITS THE FIRST TIME PUNISHER AND WOLVERINE FACE OF AGANST EACH OTHER.... AND THE FIRST TIME SUPER STAR ARTIST JIM LEE DREW WOVLERINE... THAT SAID ITS ALL RUN OF THE MILL AND PEOPLE READING IT TODAY MIGHT WONDER WHAT ALL THE FUSS IS ABOUT.(IT WAS THE EIGHTIES !!!) BUT ITS STILL WORTH A READ AND FROM THE TITLE YOU CAN WORK OUT WHERE IT IS SET TOO... BUT AT THE TIME(1988) THERE WAS SOME BUZZ ABOUT THESE TWO LEATHAL KILLERS FACING OFF AGANST EACH OTHER... ONE FOR FANS OF BOTH CHARACTERS AND ONLY SLIGHTLY DATED AND WELL WORTH PICKING UP
2,Pretty dated material,"this would be a good book if it had more info , and it misses alot of good basic and advanced prospecting techniques, if you did not know anything about prospecting it would probably be a good book to you,I own a copy, you can easily find all of this info and more on the web for free, I am not impressed.."
4,A good read!,"Intriguing view into a possible future Earth. Grant Macaw offers a glimpse into the future full of personalities, challenges and answers open to your own interpretation. It's well worth the time to read."
4,Definite movie potential...,"If you like Sci Fi, give this book a try. Give yourself some time to get use to how this book is written and then begin to fall in love with the characters. Once you get into it, you can't put it down. The characters are intriguing and the story is fresh and creative. Would make a great movie!"
4,"Great, but packets are a bit large","I wish you didn't need to use an entire packet every time. There aren't very many in the package and you go thru it quickly as a result. I recommend that when you use it, just cook up a large pot and refrigerate what you don't use so it lasts longer."
4,Soups on,I bought this soup base because our daughter loves miso soup. This stock is very easy to use and delicious. It can be blended into other dishes as well. Be aware that it is a concentrate and a little goes a long way. Simply delicious!!!
1,hahaha,"yeah it's pretty and poetic and magical still francesca style and all about thin, attractive yet troubled people in southern california - like the rest of her novels - it's repetitious and not even that sexy. francesca's use of certain four-letter words is no big deal, but when you picture the sex scenes in your mind, late night cable softcore porn comes a callin'."
4,Francesca's writings,"To all those people who wrote nasty reviews, Shut Up! Francesca's work is always Beautifly writen as well as being aluring and mysterious. I've found her to be writings awe inspiring, and wonderfully crafted. This coming from a young poet, her work is truly mesmerizing down to the last page. Though the topic has of this book has yet to be desired for most my age, I belive her to be much of an inspiration. This book and all others of Francesca Lia Block, are must reads for anyone who enjoys the unwavering splendor of her pen."
4,Not the Usual...,"...Francescaish book, but good none-the-less. Francesca usually has essences of sexuality in her stories, but this is all of them combined. It's a poetic version of 'undressed'. She still amazes with her descriptions and the way she ties the characters together. I guess she's growing up and trying to phase out of her ""young adult"" category."
3,Not Her Best,"I thought that this book was good, but that it didn't hold a candle to her other books. She is a well astablished author and this was a knew field for her but I was highly disappionted."
3,"Okay book, too short though.","I am a big-time fan of sensual fantasy literature, but this book wasn't really to my liking because the stories were too short to be developed. I realize that this IS a book of short stories, but I've read much better short stories than the ones featured in this collection."
2,What happened to Francesca?,"Francesca Lia lock has been one of my favorite authors for years now: I count The Hanged Man, Dangerous Angels, and Girl Goddess #9 among my favorite book, but this is book fails to capture the magic that lurks inside her others. Block is not an erotica writer, and it shows: the sex scenes are out of place, redundant, too fluffy, and really not that erotic at all. Many of the characters are whiny and unlikeable, although I did find the character of Plum to be interesting. The stories are too short to really pull you into them, and when she tries to intertwine them, it comes across forced and sketchy. While Francesca Lia Block's work is without a doubt wonderfully unique and beautiful, this particular book isn't. Even her biggest fans would do fine in skipping it."
3,Good...but not great.,"I have always been excited by the works of Francesca Lia bLock. Anyone who has read one of her previous works knows how poetic and sensual they are. Thus, it is only natural that she would write a collection of erotic stories. As much as I enjoyed the book, I must say it was a disapointment in comparasion to many of her earlier works. Unlike many of her previous short stories, these are slightly underdeveloped. They are exciting and fanciful, but you never really feel for the characters. Unless you've your heart set on buying it, I'd recommend previewing a story or two."
4,Enchanting,"This is the second book that I've read of Francesca Lia Block's and I've become a fan.Her stories are engrossing and they do have this touch of magic to them. The magic is hard to describe. It is just there.Her characters are real but have this otherworldliness to them that draws you in.I come away from reading one of her books feeling dreamy and blissful.Her writing has such delicious surrealism about it.Even though this book has somewhat graphic sexual stories in it, I agree with other reviewers that its not so much about sex as about the desire for real human connection. And I found the way that most characters in the book were linked from story to story to be very charming."
2,sadly disappointing,"i love francesca, i'm proud to be one of the many in her cult following, and i was so excited to read this book when i got it, despite the bad things i'd heard about it. i didn't believe it could be true, but this book is definitely lacking.first off, it's the same wonderful flowery francesca prose, but then she gets to the sex parts and it's almost like the vulgarity is forced. she doesnt even make an attempt to make the sex poetic.my advice is to get this only if you love francesca, just to read it because it's her. but otherwise, save your money to get one of her other books, like echo or weetzie bat."
2,A Big Dissapointment,"""Nymph"" was a huge dissapointment to me. I expected that there would be sex, but I was hoping it would at least be tastefull, magical...somewhat Francesca Lia Block like. But all it was was pure, untastefull and not even creative (or erotic) sex. Maybe people who are looking for that type of book, may like it....But I shur didn't. And trust me, because I didn't trust the other reviers, and I wasted my money. So I suggest that you buy another book of Francesca Lia Block, like ""I Was A Teenage Fairy,"" or ""Violet And Claire."" Anything else."
2,impressionable youths,In this world where our youth is already too impressionable (I am 19) this book doesn't really help anyone find that they are worthy regardless of what they do in or out of bed. Healing powers of sex? Right. The only time I can think of it as being healing is when two people who are committed to each other are making love and it's not simply about sex. True the book is poetic but my point that it is sending out a trashy message is proven simply by reading other people's reviews here.People want to avoid reality so much that many will want to live the fairy tales they read. Believe me that not that many people can differentiate between reality and fantasy. Look at what the movie The Craft did for Wicca. Too many people believed that the fiction they were seeing were real and wanted to act like the characters. Fortunately magick is not as simple as portrayed. But sex - anybody can have a go at it. Just something for y'all to think about.
5,I LOVE THIS ALBUM!,"I fell in love with ""L'bby Haba"" before it even hit the shelf. I love this entire CD. Great trance music. ""L'bby Haba"" makes me dance with my eyes close by myself and takes me to another place. Love it! Love it! Love it! I recommended to all my friends. More DJ Sammy...more dance music."
1,Amateur Night at the Retro Bar,"Not only is this one of those cheesy ""non-stop mix"" CDs in which the tracks overlap by a second or two (rendering it automatically useless if, like me, you want to use it for DJ purposes yourself) but the transition from ""Need You Tonight"" to ""Blue Monday 1988"" is inexplicably interrupted by the first second of INXS' ""Devil Inside"". Apparently DJ Richie Rich Miranda (to whom this ""mix"" is credited to) forgot to slide the fader over in time and nobody at Simitar had the good sense to catch it before shipping the master off. It's called quality control, brainiacs, it can only do you some good.Every one of these songs can be found elsewhere in their unexpurgated forms. Some might prove a little more elusive (I can't think of an in-print compilation with ""AEIOU Sometimes Y"" off the top of my head) but a shakedown of used bins and online vendors should bear fruit. Don't bother here."
3,few earth-shattering insights but fun to read nonetheless,"With such a provocative title, you'd think this book might open the door into the secret world of Men, so all Women might from there on in understand. It's not the case. While it does offer some good reminders (men are visual, men and women are DIFFERENT, don't hint with men, etc.), some of the book feels dated and Berkowitz's tone is that of a smarmy glossy magazine writer (which he happens to be, as well as a correspondent for various daytime TV programs like Today).The book can be read in one sitting, and since it's very light, you won't feel weighed down if you consume it all at once. Recommended, but more for fun and as a time-passer than as a real cornerstone of understanding the differences between the sexes or developing a really deep understanding of men."
1,Very misleading title,"This book drags on and on and on with stories that attempt to be humourous, but just come up long-winded and pointless...On Berkowicz's chapter on Why Men are Jerks...he explains that women want men to be jerks...On his chapter regarding sex, he explains in detail how men love and will do anything to get it. Now, true many women are attracted to jerks, and men infact enjoy and love sex, but what's the big secret you're letting us in on here? I found the book to be rather boring, and hard to read."
1,waste of time,i did not care for this book whatso ever ...waste of my time waste of my money..it didnt tell me nothing..mr.bob spilled no secrets not that he knew any to start with i am sure..i threw the book away..zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
4,Very fun and insightful read!,"I found this book very cute and somewhat liberating. It's a combination of 'He's just not that into you' and a man giving a more understanding explanation for each situation. The book is very interesting, I found myself somewhat surprised at some revelations and explanations for certain male behaviors that do make sense.It is not a scientifically researched book for sure, but it is definitely a fun read written by a very funny honest man. I finished it in 2 days bc it was so enjoyable!"
2,Good book to read!,"I would suggest for women to read, ""What men won't tell you but women need to know"". My favorite part is how it describes how to read signs from a guy to have a better appreciation and communication in a relationship. I think knowing how a guy thinks will help to deepen my relationships and learn not to take things so personal."
2,you need to know this....,"I didnt feel this book was all that enlightening! It did have funny encerts in it that made it entertaining, but really wasnt that helpful, most of it was all common sense!"
1,IT'S JUST THAT BADDDD!,THIS BOOK WAS SO BADLY WRITTEN THAT I DON'T WANT YOU TO WAIST YOUR TIME READING A REVIEW ON IT. RUUUUUN WHILE YOU STILL CAN... GO ON WITHOUT ME!
3,"What Men Won't Tell You, but Women Need To Know","Basic information delivered as a quick read. Not what I would call an ""in depth"" study."

GO ON WITHOUT ME!""hahah love it - a funny review made even funnier by the mispelling of ""waist"" right after slamming the author for bad writing hehe. this is the first review i've ever done for Amazon - odd that turned out to be a review of a review ;) i couldn't resist!"

4,Voices of protest against FDR.,"I found this book interesting for several reasons. My Dad lived through the Great Depression and thought highly of FDR. He often mentioned the threats to FDR's presidency which included people like Lindberg, Long, and Coughlin. In this book, Brinkley singles out the two threats to FDR in 1936. Every man a king, and Huey on the top of the heap. Scary thought, especially in regards to how Long ruled Lousiana. Then Coughlin, a politic priest is also an issue. Both posed hazards to FDR's presidency.This is a good solid read about politics of the early 1930s. If America had elected Long, it would be a different more radical America. Coughlin became a bigot, Long was gunned down, and FDR saved the country."
3,Perhaps a bit too much...,"Several sections in this book are very useful and I enjoyed the historical background on the various types of Qigong. However, I found the book to be too ""dense"" with exercises rather than going into the details of a few major types. I also believe some of the exercises shown are NOT going to be beneficial to practitioners, particularly those in the martial section using things like staffs to pressure areas of the body.As someone who has practiced Qigong for a while I also found the lack of warnings and/or instruction of the proper methods of developing into the exercises to be a little scary. Many exercises can cause harm if not done properly, just as meditating with bad posture will do more harm than good. The book is useful to someone who has been doing exercises for a while and might be looking for a big picture of what has been done historically but I wouldn't recommend it to a beginner. Better to stick with Frantzis or Wong Kiew Kit and find a good teacher."
3,Not bad,"This book does not deliver much knowledge to the average westerner who is seeking self-instruction in ChiGung. In my opinion, the authors did not consider that western people LEARN in a way that is different from that of eastern people. There is a clear effort to teach, I just think that the method is wrong.Eventually the authors tried to put too many irons in the fire. It's not a bad book, it's just bland."
4,Good,"This is a good book. It covers many aspects of Chi Gung. Sometimes it lacks some depths, though."
1,Only for the uninformed,"I've been practicing martial arts for 20 years, internal and external from some of the top masters in the world. Shou-Yu Liang knows nothing about real qigong. This is just idiot material. The fact that he is some kind of coach in China shows what little the general public knows about Taoist Methods. If you want to learn Taoism, learn from a real Taoist Master not some coach certified by the Chinese government. As if the Chinese government knows anything about real martial arts."
2,Broken case,"I receise this opened on it and it fell on the floor, the case was broken, whould not hold the disk in place I have not used it."
2,recieved book,"i ordered a book from you guys and really REALLY needed it. i waited a week to recieve it and when i did, it was not in ""GOOD"" condition as stated, it was in ""BAD"" if not ""very Bad"" condition. Im very frustrated with this product. front an back covers ripped off, came without it them.....NOTHING like the picture you had displayed on the item posting- this is the first thing i ordered from Amazon and i assumed ""Amazon"" was a good product company because they're a know customer to Fastcap which i work for, and build the Contractor Packs, 4 packs, 2 packs, twin packs, 2-piece system....- im diffenitly not happy, because the college wouldn't let me register for next quarter do to a lost book ""making sense"" which i had to reemberse, and what i recieved is in no quality to be accepted for my reembersment.------like I said, I didn't recieve what was shown on the displaying picture"
1,Buyer Beware! Tipping Hazard!,"We purchased this item because it LOOKED nice and was a great (cheap!)price. We are, however, extremely dissapointed with the quality of this item. Drawers are very small, although the facings are large. The dresser appears nice, especially for the price, however once we assembled it (about 1 1/2 hrs) and moved it into my son's room onto carpet, we noticed the problem. It is extremely unsteady and would tip forward, even if one drawer is opened. VERY UNSAFE! We took it back to local Target for a refund and they told us we have to disassemble it and mail it back to online Target. My husband left the dresser there at Target and told them to throw it in the garbage where it belongs. (The dresser company provided a tip resistance kit, which is basically one screw and a small bracket, but we still don't feel that it is safe.) Buy something else! One star is too high for this item."
2,disappointing,"After enjoying ""Wild Child"" and ""Winter Waits"", I was terribly disappointed with this story's negativity. In the two previous books, Ms. Plourde focused on the beauty of the seasons and the wonderful relationships between parent and child. In ""Spring's Sprung"", the whole story revolves around the very worst of sibling rivalry, with none of the joyful teasing that often accompanies such behavior. The only redeeming aspect of the book is the illustrations."
4,Springs' sprung is cute,"This book was a fun read before bedtime. Although we LOVE Wild Child and think it's the best of the four seasons books, this one was also cute. I would highly recommend Wild Child though, if you'll be purchasing and Lynn Plourde books."
2,replaced beauty with stereotypes better avoided,"The other reviews say it all. The whimsical artwork and prose of Wild Child and Winter Waits were completely supported by the seasonal sweetness of the books. Spring's Sprung brought more focus to querrling than to beauty of the book or of the cycles of the season. Advocating harmonious sibling relationships in my own household, I feel that bringing the message of sibling rivalry as normal and inevitable (part of the childhood ""season""?)to be against my values. If you are careful about the messages you bring to your children read this book before buying."
3,"Ok, but too slow","The music is good - original artists, but the tempo is too slow for running. I think it would be good for biking (but I haven't tried it yet)."
5,Golf bag holder,Product was simple to assemble and does what it's supposed to. I suggest you also buy the Rubbermaid basket as well to hold golf balls & misc. accessories.
4,"Good read, but not his best.","I really like Jay Bonansinga. From his first book, a horror novel called THE BLACK MARIAH, to his subsequent thrillers, I've watched a good writer approaching greatness. THE SLEEP POLICE is not his best work, I'm sorry to say, but it is a good read and I would recommended reading it. A detective investigates a series of brutal murders, known as ""thumbsuckers"" because the way the victims are positioned after death, but he comes up against a brick wall as he delves into the case. Strange messages appear and periods of black outs and fugues lead him to believe he himself may be the killer. Then things really heat up. Bonansinga kind of overplays his hand a bit here, which is surprising for such a small book. Towards the end it got so relentless and incredible, it sort of stretched believability for me. But it is a neat idea, and a fast moving thriller. Keep your eye on this author. He's one to watch."
4,"Fun, exciting, elaborate","This book is truly great! The first 30 pages really bring you in, and after that, this book is a ride! If you like police chases, and police cases, this book is for you, because it talks about police lives. A new murder reminded Janus of a cold case that almost ruined his career ten years ago, and may ruin it now...THIS BOOK IS AWESOME!"
5,The Best Thriller of 2002!,"Simply a great book, start to finish. Mr. Bonansinga writes tight, crisp prose and takes the reader on a roller coaster ride that keeps getting faster and faster up until the 200 mph conclusion.A must read!"
1,You're getting sleepy...,"Blame it on mom, says the shrink, but don't blame me, if you waste time with this one."
4,Compelling,"I found this book of poems to be utterly compelling. Moving and subtle, full of contrasts and contemplations, any lover of Eliot or Stevens will love these poems. Based in the American Southeast but applicable to the antiquities of Europe and indeed all of mankind, it will truly bring you to appreciate the closeness between you and your neighbor."
4,Good value for price,"This bag looks nice and keeps your laptop well protected. I like the inside design for storage of papers and other stuff. It stands up when it is on the floor, which is also convenient. A very nice bag for the price."
5,Microsoft Ladies Laptop Tote-- Manhattan,Very nice heavy bag. Looks like it will last for a long time and be a great laptop or everything work bag. Has a very heavy luggage style zipper.
3,"very solid, good quality bag but too big for girl","The tote look nice, keep balance compromise between formal and girlish , but I think is it too big for a girl, no need to have such a big tote , otherwise one should go for case or backpack."
5,I keep my copy with me,"The one book I'll never part with, that's followed me all over the world, through 41 of my 61 years and the 4 continents where I've lived, and is always kept beside my bed, is James Kunen's Strawberry Statement. I reread it every couple of years because it reminds me of who I was, what I believed in, and that I thought we could change the world. It serves me as some sort of moral compass, setting me back on track when I start getting complacent or jaded or just plain lazy."
2,"Looks great, but sluggish gameplay","I had just acquired Cruisin' Exotica for the N64, and was excited to see a GBC version. Although the graphics are great, and there are a decent number of options (cars and tracks to select from), I just find the gameplay boring. A good racing game requires precise control, and it just ain't there. Despite the lush background, oncoming vehicles lack any detail and are just colored blocks that come out of nowhere. I'm sure there's a better racing game out there for this system. If you're a fan of the ""Cruisin'"" series, stick with the N64."
2,awful a waste of money,"this game is one of the worst games i ever played. at first when i saw it i thaught of the old arcade action, classic and really cool the box art was cool (witch i was tricked i hope no one else does) i paid about [$$] for it. i got home ripped open the box put it in my GBA and played it it flat out... i really hope no one buys this game."
2,"Very Dissapointing! Ranges from poor to mediocre, nothing great. Some Repeats.","As owner of Every single Chill/Lounge music CD I am aware of, this was the biggest dissapointment in a long time. Chillout 2001 thru Chillout 8 was very good in comparison. This CD is not a complete disaster, however, I could not find one song worthy of a 5/5 star rating. Quite a few 4/5 star songs however, lots of 2-3 star songs. Some of the better songs were repeated on older Chill discs or present on other series of lounge discs.I think the people that rated this 4 or 5 stars don't own a lot of lounge/chill and are probably a lot easier to please. I'm very dissapointed. Maybe this 'genre' is all dried up! :) Oh well...I highly recomend any of the CDs in this set before this one. In fact, Chillout sessions 7 was SUPERB!!!"
4,partittion majic,i felt that the parttion majic software was reeally great on my 20gb machine but didnt have much impact on my other machine that has two drives
2,My Sore Butt,"1-1/2"" Thick - 9"" to 11"" Wide Bicycle Seat Cover / Gel Pad - MediumThis Bicycle Seat Cover is too narrow/hard for the human butt. I called the company to ask if they had a larger/softer seat. They said no.I went to Wal-Mart and purchased a Travel Neck Pillow and taped it to the seat to protect my butt from the hurt and pain caused by this tiny/hard seat.Taping the Travel Neck Pillow to the Bicycle Seat Cover allowed me to use the Stationary Bike long enough to get the needed exercise."
3,"""Land of Milk and Honey""?","Jesus, get it right. I'm a die-hard Ministry fan, but I'm tempted to give this weak-willed compilation album a neutral rating simply because the reviewer doesn't know Jourgensen's Ministry for Ministry of Sound's 2000 clubber's guide to trance. ""Land of Milk and Honey"" should be ""Land of Rape and Honey"". Is it so hard to read the liner notes? You'd think someone mildly knowledgable could have been curtailed to write the review."
3,Ministry - Greatest Fits,"This is a pretty good greatest hits album, but it could have been a lot better. The album is completely devoid of any of their new wave hits, which is pretty disappointing, I always thought it was definitely a highlight in their career. I also don't see the point in having a drawn out live version of ""So What"" on this disc, they should have just gone with the regular version and used this for another compilation of B Sides or something. And then they include Supernaut... I'm sorry, why? That is not Ministry, it is 1000 Homo DJs. I feel they just added it because Trent Reznor did the vocals. Like I said, this is good, but it could have been much better and I think they have more hits than they gave themself credit for. ""Revenge""? ""Over the Shoulder""? And even more left out. Swap out a couple of the tracks that don't belong and fill the CD to capacity. They could have done it, but they chose not to."
3,"The ""best"" of ministry","Sorely lacking alot of the bands early material, this is still a good starting place for young ministry fans. This release also contains the song ""what about us"" from the movie A.I., Which makes it yet another reason to own this."
4,Great Buy for a new Ministry fan,"This is the perfect album for either a new Ministry fan, or an old one who doesn't own any of their albums yet. The only problem is that it's missing ""Burning Inside""."
5,a found treasure,"I was thrilled to find ""Hildy""s Herb Recipes"" written by my mother-in-law, Hildegarde Kiefer Hinkel, on Amazon.com. My copy of the book was lost many years ago. The recipe book was published in 1980. Thanks to Amazon.com for offering it 32 years later. ""HIldy's Herb Recipes"" has many of our families' favorite recipes and this book will be treasured for years to come."
3,"OK, I've heard better fusion.(Great bass player, though.)","A so-so album from a great bass player. The tunes are a little bit ""lost in fusion land""(notice I said ""tunes,"" not ""compositions""), but not bad."
5,Casio Men's G-Shock Atomic Solar Watch,"Everything about this watch is perfect. It is easy to program, the alarm is easily heard, and you can see what time it is WITHOUT glasses! My husband wears this watch daily while performing the duties of a police officer. Needless to say, it gets banged around a lot without showing any adverse effect. The only concern I would have is that the watch is on the large size, and probably would be too big for a smaller man."
2,Flawed Concept,"I was intrigued by the concept of this watch with a rechargeable battery and time-signal radio receiver. The battery does indeed recharge fully with one hour's worth of direct, unimpeded sunlight. However, the automatic update by the Colorado-based radio time signal is problematic. Living on the east coast, it has not updated automatically even once since I purchased it, even though I dutifully put it next to a window (as suggested) before going to sleep. But this requirement brings up another poorly thought-out design: if the watch is over near the window at night, it's not a very convenient alarm clock (as I use it this way often as I travel.) And that, in turn, brings up yet another poor feature: the alarm only sounds for 10 seconds. If it was a short night's sleep, 10 seconds isn't enough to get my attention and I now must set (any carry) another alarm clock to insure that I arise promptly. Additionally, the watch is very heavy, and some of the buttons are very difficult to push."
1,still havent recieved,i have yet to recieve this item and i ordered it a month ago. i was supposed to get it while i was home on leave but that didnt happen. now im back in baghdad and dont kno when ill get it.
3,Belt Adjustment,The only reason I am giving it 3 *'s is because it is very difficult to get its belt adjusted. You have to get it done from a Authorized person. This may cost in range of 10 to 15$. But apart from the cost I found it diffcult to find such a person.Leaving that aside I like this watch very much....
2,Read the Description !,"I bought this watch for my husband, but didn't take the time to read the description carefully. So it's my fault I had to send it back. He is in the Army and leaving soon for Iraq. I thought this sturdy watch would be a perfect gift. Unfortunately it does not work if you're more than 2,000 miles from Colorado. If you are not going to leave the continental United States I suppose it would be a good watch."
4,keeps good time/ miss the count down timer,"Typical solid G-Shock construction. Keeps good time even without the atomic clock query feature. I have little use for the ""time recorder"" feature. I wish it had the count down timer like my old model"
2,NO WARRANTY FOR THIS WATCH,"Be careful, there is no warranty for this watch!!!!I bought it 3 months ago and it stopped working after 2 weeks. I returned it to ""The Time Machine"" in California to get it fixed; which is an authorized return and warranty shop for Casio and they said it would cost $90 to fix it (I paid $85 for it on Amazon) . They also informed me there is no warranty for watches bought through Amazon or other resellers.IT is a cool watch...but be careful because if it breaks, you are stuck with it."
3,"Nice watch, but kind of difficult to work with","First off, although the amazon description states otherwise, the watch does *NOT* have a countdown timer.Also, the manual that comes with the watch offers zero information on how to adjust the band length. It's quite difficult to remove the links in order to make it shorter. Calling Casio is of little use, as they don't have ready access to the information. I was told they would email me the information, but it would take a few days because the person who sent the email was not in their office.That said ... it is a nice watch ... quite solidly built, nice looking, plenty of features ('cept, of course, the countdown timer), and fairly easy to control."
1,Family Tree Maker,"The family tree maker, which I purchased with such excitement, has been a great let-down to me. When I follow the directions and insert a cd, it will say it isn't inserted, please insert the cd, or that it can't read the cd. I can't imagine what is wrong with it, but it is useless to me. Since I purchased the set some time back and I haven't used it since the first week I bought it. I would like to return it for a refund."
1,WARNING--cheap glass lid shattered when hot,"The glass lid (I'm assuming it's not Pyrex--there were no claims that it was) survived the first few dinner preparations, but tonight the lid shattered after we cooked some fish stew. The hot lid was placed on the counter away from the saute, and, a few seconds later, it exploded with enough force to send small glass shards flying up to a foot away. Needless to say, the fish stew had to be thrown out--what a waste. But I'm glad nobody in the kitchen was hurt.Due to the above safety issue, the product deserves a negative rating--but that's not possible, so I've given it an undeserving one star.The body of the saute itself seems sturdily constructed. But with the auto-destruction of the lid, I have to wonder what other quality issues remain undiscovered."
5,Incredible even cooking,I have been using this pan for 5 months now and have had no issues with lid. I know I have even had corning ware break when it went from high temps to cold too suddenly. It is great for cooking sauces!
3,not what I expected,"I enjoyed the format of the live show, but all the songs are presented in a medley format. Lots of songs,all sung by Mercer, but only the first part of every song is performed."
1,Poor product.,I received this item in a shipment of other items ordered from this store. I order black fungus or tree ear mushroom quite often. I know how they are suppose to look. This product looked like it had been ran over by a steam roller and reduced to crumbs and powder. I will be returning this for a refund. The package was shipped in a good protective box. so i know it was shipped in this condition. I would have never fulfilled an order that looked like this.
3,Packaging not as pictured,"I found this ""dried black fungus"" on an ""oddest items available through Amazon list"" and ordered a package as a gag gift for a friend. Unfortunately, the bag which arrived is not the same as the photo in the listing, and doesn't say ""Dried Black Fungus."" I can't say whether the dried mushroom strips (?) the bag contains are any good, but I would suggest only ordering this product if you intend to eat it- not because of the humorous packaging."
5,Detailed but understandable.,"I have only had this book for 2 weeks, and prior to this I have had about a month and a half of basic karate and tae kwon do training. The forms are difficult to learn in the sense that unlike the ""hard"" forms of karate, the forms illustrated consist of several movements one must learn and then connect them smoothly. Therefore it may take 8 or so moves to deliver just one punch, but in the process you are also blocking and grabbing and pulling with each move. I highly recommend this book for those who earnestly wish to learn the basics of Seven Star Mantis. If you are unsure of which martial art is best suited for your body and mindset, this style is primarliy based on agility and flexibility. Evading all attacks to quickly defeat an opponent as well as reading every movement they make and ""feeling"" where they will move is the guiding force for Seven Star Praying Mantis"
4,Good basic exercises and pictures,"It appears to be an overview of the 7 star mantis style with pictures to detail a number of the style's techniques. I was able to become comfortable with several of the techniques without having any previous martial arts experience. Overall, I think this is a pretty good book even though there is a section that is very difficult to practice without a wooden dummy."
2,NOt recommend,It is only introduction. Not much about Mantis itself. The book is actually teach wing Tsun because the author is expert in Wing Tsun.Only buy if you want to learn Wing TsunNot worth if want real knowledge about Mantis kung fu
4,Story all Americans should be reading NOW!,"This is a fast paced, easy read. This book would make a terrific movie or TV series. I loved the characters and the romance tri-angle really added to the plot. I hope there will be a sequel to this story. The parts on Islam and the Nation of Islam in America really got my attention. I wish the Vengers really existed."
3,When you Least Expect It: A Little Dare\A Younger Man,I enjoyed A Little Dare. It was cute. The title was clever as well. I did not like A Younger Man. Common sense and therapy could have helped the main character. The story was a bit far fetched.
4,Concerning Scordato's book on Sarah W: it's readable but...,"I found the book to coinside with most of my research on Sarah. There are some inaccuracies, however. The statements on stage-appearences, and rape, to be general, overall and too sweeping in context. Sarah's death of TB is highly unlikely--food poisoning is more possible. Some of Scordato's terminology in describing Piute things and locations is inaccurate. And--Sarah would never, ever not be interested in the welfare of her people! ""A 44 year old Sarah took little interest..."" says Scordato. Hah! And--Sarah spoke five languages, not 2 languages and 3 dialects. I have Gae Whitney Canfield's research on that!"
3,A little fragile around the hinge,"Adv: Protects the screen nicely and is very compact, not bulky like other casesDisavd: The cover flips up to give you access to the screen and the hinges at the top look fragile to me.You can't dock it with the cover onThe power button is partially covered."
2,Very Disappointing,"I was really disappointed by this e-book. I found the style of presentation and the way the content was presented really detracted from what I usually find to be very interesting themes.I think that there are other books of Zipes' that cover this material in a much clearer and appealing way, such as 'The Irresistible Fairy Tale'."
4,good book,It is very interesting and it gives you so much information about the fairy tales and the mass media industry.
1,i can't believe this,"This book is severely biased. Which would be ok, but besides being biased, it also presents several blatant lies. Opinions are ok, distortion of facts is something else entirely."
3,Lexmark P450 Printer,I was disappointed it only prints 4X6 pictures. It would be much better if it also had the option to print 2 or 4 pictures on 4x6 paper. It does print nice pictures for the obtion it has.
3,Good printer came with bad ink cartridge,"When we received our new printer and we tried to print, every picture came out green. After a couple of days of troubleshooting, reading, and getting on the products web page we finally called the support center, which was in INDIA. Talk about very hard to understand. It was frustrating enough trying to figure out the printer situation, but then to get someone in a foreign country to try to walk you through his troubleshooting steps was not pleasant. He was very, very hard to understand. He finally did decide to send us a new ink cartridge and it was on my doorstep the very next day. Since then, the printer has been GREAT. Lexmark definately needs to pay the extra money and get an American Support Center!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,"awful printer, awful support","The picture came out pink and grainy. And after several cartridge alignments, I still get the alignment error. And I am still waiting for the response from the customer support."
1,What a rip off!!,"I got this printer because my previous one (Epson) was pulled off the counter and broke..... and because I liked the CD burner. I had read some mixed reviews, but I thought I would try it. I figured it would work okay. Well, I was WAY wrong. I have only owned this thing for 2 months and now it doesn't work at all. I can't even turn it on.During the 2 months that it was working, I wasn't impressed with the picture quality. It didn't meet the standards I was used to.I am going back to Epson - I like their printer's so much better!"
1,help,I haven't ordered this book yet because it does not describe it at all on the internet. I want to know if the Teddy Bear Photo Album by Deborah Schneck is a photo album that I can put pictures in or is it just a photo album with 48 pages of teddy bears. Will someone please let me know. my name is MAria and my email address is jamesdigiacomo@msn.com
1,keep looking for miso salad dressing,this stuff does not taste like an authentic miso salad dressing - way too sweet. Must be all that high fructose corn syrup.
5,"SATISFIED,yes!",I am very satisfied with this single. It is done in a superb manner. Christina Aguilera is MOST DEFINATLY the diva of the group! She attracted MANY of her fans!Voulez-vous coucher avec moi? Ce Sior? Oui! Oui!
2,defective,"I received the tank topper very fast and was pleased with how quickly it was shipped. However, the assembly was difficult, due to misaligned cage sides. The hooks didn't match up to the eyelets and I ended up bending the hooks down and out with pliers, which caused some of the plastic coating to come off. The instructions say you might have to tweek the hooks a bit but I'm sure not that much.It still wasn't secure since the cage sides did not match properly so I ended up securing the sides with twist ties. You can't tell I had trouble and the gerbils like it but the item was not perfect. If I'd bought it at Petco I could have returned it to the store easily--and would have. For as costly as it was I expected a quality piece.The product is a great idea and gives the animals lots of extra room!"
2,Do not buy if your pet chews anything!!!,"I bought this for my son's pet rat. I was thrilled with it to begin with, it's a great idea, just bad materials.To make a long story short, a month after having her in this we noticed she was weak and had stopped eating. We looked at the backside of the ""house"" and she had eaten a large amount of it. Upon googling rats eating plastic we learned this is common and causes obstructions, resulting in death. My 10 yr old and I watched his pet CeCe suffer to death, which took 2 days.Plastic has no business being in small animal cages imo."
2,"Cheap, flimsy but tolerable","We ordered this tank topper to go over a 10 gallon tank for 2 gerbils. From the moment of opening the box, we could tell it was going to be cheap. Fairly easy to put together, but pieces don't hinge nicely, leaving large gaps. Bars are easily bendable, also creating potential gap for escape. The shelves are quite sturdy, though chewers will have the ramps and food dish in pieces quickly. Even the house was chewed up within a couple of weeks. For the money, I would not get this one again, though we are tolerating it and making it work as we don't have escape artists--yet."
1,Not safe for rats!,"I cannot review this product for non-mammalian pets, but it is generally considered unsafe to house your rat in a glass tank, period. Even with the addition of the open, wire topper, the ammonia from urine still builds up too much, leading to respiratory irritation in species already probe to respiratory infections. Just ditch the tank and get a cage with 1/2"" bar spacing."
4,Price,"Hi... I just ordered this item. haven't gotten it as yet. I live in Trinidad, does anyone know whats the price to clear it?"
1,horrible,the tank topper was horrible. it was a pain to get set up and the label tricked me. Don't be fooled by the box. it doesn't come with the tank or the hamster stuff in the inside. It is just metal wires in a shape of a box.
5,tank topper,"the tank topper works great, still allows ventilation, but the use of aquarium for better watching of your pets. only one thing if they are a chewer, will chew ramp."
4,Tank Topper,"Great idea for a small rodent. My pet rat really enjoys this much more than her old smaller 1 story cage, but it does have a few problems. Firts, it really should fit more snug to a fish tank or should come with the tank that it does fit. Also, the water bottle doesnt really work and the only opening is on the very top and for children it might be difficult to be able to take out their pet to play. Over all I think its a great tank and is a pretty decent price."
4,Excellent idea!,This cage topper came as described and fit perfectly on the 10 gal tank that I had. My only suggestion would be to put a door to get your rat out from the side as well. My 8 year old has a hard time reaching clear to the bottom to fetch the rat.
1,Awful,"I bought this for my hamster, thinking it would be perfect for her. It said it was ""chew-proof"" and that small creatures couldn't get out. I put it together, and attached it to the top. The first night, she kept me up all night chewing on it. So much for ""chew-proof"". So I put her in our basement, and a couple days later, I went down to check on her, and she wasn't there! So far she has escaped THREE times! I even attached weights and tied it down, and she bent the wires to get out. I wish I had never bought this cage;"
2,Ate it up...,"Seriously, I have 2 gerbils and they've eaten the house and half the ramps up. They have plenty of chew sticks and they prefer the plastic. The product is great, but does not stand up for gerbils and their chewing. I recommend looking into almost the same thing but metal that they cannot chew up. Not to mention, my gerbils tend to crap on the platforms. The wire ones have holes so that it will fall into the bedding and not smell so much. I'm ordering that one today."
4,A fine cage topper,"The wire cage topper works great. It attaches securely to my 10-gallon aquarium via two ingeniously designed spring clips, and the clasps fit securely at all four corners. It's easy to take on and off, and it allows plenty of air circulation into the acquarium.I've decided not to use the plastic accessories, though. My hamster holed up in the little house immediately, and I figured I'd never seen him again as long as the house was there. Instead, I provide plenty of pine shavings, and if he wants to burrow completely under them, he does.Also, after realizing how smooth and slippery the ramps are, I decided not to set them up in the cage. They're quite steep when configured as designed, and since hamsters are nearsighted and clumsy, it seemed likely my critter could tumble quite a long way.Even without the plastic accessories, the tank topper is worthwhile. The price at Amazon is very reasonable, especially with free Super Saver shipping."
3,Adds extra space,I bought two of these for my kids hamsters and the one hamster does great climbing and doing everything the cage is for. The other hamster fell off the top when she started sliding and refused to go up again so now the cage is in the basement.Its also not as easy to get to your hamster since if she is in the tank you can't just open the top and reach in unless you have super long arms so you must remove the entire top which for a kid can be tough. I worry that they will not hook it right and it will get knocked off and the cats will have lunch.Often the hamster food ends up all over the place too since its set in the top part and if you are not completly steady it spills.
2,DO NOT buy this for mice!,"My 7-year-old daughter bought this with her Christmas money for her pet mice. About 2 weeks ago, the smaller of the two escaped through a gap in the bars. We were never able to find her. I didn't remove the cage topper because I thought the other mouse, who is a full-grown adult, was not able to get through the bars. Apparently, I was wrong. Yesterday my daughter discovered the other mouse was not in the cage. We set out food, which was taken overnight, but haven't seen the mouse yet. So my daughter now has a tank topper for an empty tank. And if we find the mouse, she will not be using the tank topper anymore.I gave it 2 stars because when the mice stayed in it, it was really cute. The food goes in the upper level, and the mice learned quickly to run up the ramp. However, they then pee and poop on the platforms, which stinks to no end. So every time I cleaned the cage I had to hose off the whole topper."
4,rtywtrywtyw,it is pretty good and eaisy for them to climb but they do tend to chew it so you need to give them somthing to chew on.
4,convinient,The cage really makes the living space of my pet bigger and I can see my rat having more fun than when it was just in the aquarium without the top
3,Not for every small animal,"I got this and actually like it, but for our little dwarf hamster it's not right. The house is too tall for her to climb on so she can't even get to the ramps. The ramps are also too steep for her. We'll definitely use this for the next hamster, but it's not right for the smaller varieties of hamsters."
1,Not for mice as advertised!!,"I'm sure this tank topper would be great for larger pets - rats, etc... but it is not good for tiny ones! My pet mouse got out the same day I put this stupid thing on top of my tank. I'm really angry this is advertised for mice when they apparantly can just slip through the bars! Do not buy this for mice...my mouse is still missing after two days and I wish I'd never bought this stupid thing :("
1,Dwarf Hamster Escaped!,"We were so happy to provide more space to our two dwarf hamsters with this cute and practical cage. It seemed both secure and fun, and it made us laugh to see our ""girls"" run up and down the ramps.Imagine our surprise when, after about a week of having installed the tank topper, my daughter found one of our hamsters running around her bedroom! The tank and topper were both intact (topper properly seated and secured on the tank, door closed and latched) and one hamster was still inside.This cage is definitely not suitable for dwarf hamsters, and I would award zero stars if I could--I now have a useless cage that I cannot return. Do not purchase this item for dwarf hamsters unless you like chasing them around your house. We were extremely lucky and had a happy ending, with a found and unharmed hamster, but it made for a very stressful evening. Consider this cage only for larger hamsters and gerbils."
4,Pleasing Enough,"I love this cage, and I would highly recommend this to owners that have Syrian Hamsters (Golden Hamster) because when I got my cage, some of the bars were a little bent and open, so if you have a dwarf hamster, espescially a Roboroski, then they would escape. The problems I have with this cage is that it didn't come with a tank. I thought it did, but you must have a 10 gallon tank in order to put it on. The good thing about it is that it comes with a food dish, a little plastic brick house, some ramps and a water bottle. I would only recommend this for hamsters that are not so skinny,or small."
1,Bars too far apart!,"My kid put this on her tank, and within a day our cat got the gerbil's tail through the bars. Cost me $200 to have the gerbil's tail properly amputated due to the injury. They call it ""degloving"" where the skin comes off like a glove. Also, turns out the bars are too far apart: gerbils can get their snouts through far enough to do some chewing. Can't be good for the gerbil's mouth. This would have been really great if the bars were close together, or it had wire mesh sides (like the construction of gerbil exercise wheels)."
3,great!,"This is a fun top cage for a 10 gallon tank that works really well. My rat loves climbing on the ramps and loves to sleep on the top shelf, This is a great product for rats."
1,Not Good!,"My daughter's dog was poisoned so we decided to get her some chinese hamsters. Everything was great for about a month than one day she went in to hold one of them (we had 2) & they escaped! I dont know how but they were gone! So on top of her dog passing away her hamsters escaped. Not a Happy girl at all. Also it looks like a good fun set up but before the escapees got out, there would be alot of do-do & seeds that would fall out when they would sit on the shelves."
1,"NOT for gerbils, rats, & animals that chew!","The materials in the cage are made of plastic, which, any small pet owner with experience would know that if it's intended to house gerbils, rats, even mice (read the reviews, people!!!) it is USELESS and even HARMFUL if the pets ingest it! Go back and remake those things with METAL!!! It's like the people who create cages do not know the first thing about the future potential inhabitants!"
5,Billy Stritch,This man is hardly known for his amazing talent-he is always behind the scenes working to make the performers he works with shine. Finally he can be heard on his own.
2,BIG MISTAKE,"Billy, you should have never left Sharon Montgomery...there is the talent!! And, why do you keep singing all of BASIA's songs??????"
5,Excellent,Item is excellent and as described by seller. Slight issue with mailing and seller was very proactive in addressing. Thank you.
5,Great condition,"This book was shipped to me in a good amount of time, didn't take too long. Also, it is in great condition like I expected it to be."
4,A valuable resource,"This book was a valuable resource when I designed a Biology-themed project. The images are well-rendered and the book scans well enough. The variety is good enough for the price, but for less desirable subjects such as fungi, ferns, and even some aspects of meteorology the depiction leaves something to be desired. However, (especially) for dicots, astronomy, anthropology, and ornithology, the drawings are superb."
2,Hmm...,"This was an OK book...I planned to use it for altered books and art journals, and I'm afraid that the number of images (few) and the types of images (limited) kind of limit this book's usefulness. The thing I didn't like is, there are one, two, even three pages wit hthe same stuff on them. And it's not a bunch of little related images; it's a whole page out of some ancient book that doesn't look like it will lend itself very well to cutting and pasting this or that very particular image out of the whole scene.If you're looking for many intricate images of the same thing (the human skeleton, for instance, or the mechanical plans of some old-fashioned machine) then this is for you. If you're looking for just 1 or 2 smaller images per topic but with many topics (like most of the other clip art books by this publisher) then you may not find this to be of much use to you."
4,The Legend Is Back!,"""The Legend Is Back With Something Very Special"" - that's how DRG promoted this album. It had been far to many years between studio albums for the legendary Miss Peggy Lee ... now she was back with an album that displays her greatest strenghts: her ability to swing (""Just One Of Those Things"") and her tender, easy approach to ballads (""Through The Eyes Of Love""). The album is a good mix of classics (""Rain Sometimes"") and contemporary (""You""). The musicians are superb! Listen for the beautiful guitar stylings of John Chiodini who continued to tour, record and write songs with Peggy for many years.Sincere-Lee,Robert Strom THE PEGGY LEE FAN CLUB 744 COLLIER DRIVE SAN LEANDRO, CA 94577"
3,a dissapointment,"My copy of this album is a 1993 one under Success/Elap Music/DRG from England. This album introduced me to Peggy Lee, and instantly I became her fan. However, when I started collecting and listening to other Peggy CDs from Italy, Spain, and France (no Peggy recordings in my country), I found out that I do not really need to listen to this particular CD. This CD is a recording made when Peggy was already too old to sing, hence the voice quality is not really Peggy's although all songs are good. The inferior recording quality in this CD is the biggest dissapointment considering that this was just recorded recently. I like to think that I am the number one fan of Peggy in the Philippines. It is therefore OK for me to keet this CD. But for those not very devoted to Peggy, I suggest that they buy other Peggy CDs. The best songs I heard are those recorded between 1950 to 1960."
2,"Good Materials , Poor Fitting","I bought these boots for my little sister a definite size 8. She was unable to get her foot into them due to the tight stiching at the base of the tongue. Great price, but we had to return them."
1,Garbage,The first two Phantom planet cds = great.This cd = complete crap.The fact that phantom planet were such a great band at one time makes this cd even worse.Anyone who likes this should be draged out in the street and shot.Maybe if no one buys this album Phantom Planet will go back to their pre sellout sound.
4,"PP Gets Out of ""California""","Well, well, well. Look what we have here: a Phantom Planet CD for Strokes fans. And it's not half bad, either. Die-hard fans of Phantom Planet's catchy, gorgeously poppy sound will surely be disappointed, but they need to get over themselves. Traces of Phantom Planet's former melodic tendencies can be seen on the subdued ""After Hours"" and ""By the Bed."" The rest of the album is pure, scuzzy garage rock. And rock it does. The boys are clearly better musicians beneath the feedback, with Sam Farrar's bass stealing the show on many tracks. The lyrics are stronger and more mature, especially on the shameless all-things-New-York ripoff ""1st Things 1st."" This is a solid album, and a radical change. But sometimes, as in this case, change is good. The only real loss is the waste of singer Alexander Greenwald's considerable vocal talent, here reduced to a currently fashionable droning monotone. Sure, I miss ""California."" But NYC is cool too."
5,Its good no matter what Planet you're on!,"This album was the 1st of the bands material to reach my ears and I liked it immediately! As I listened more and more, I started to LOVE this album, every song is just SOLID... I just had to check out their other material. As I checked out their earlier stuff, I heard a pretty big difference from the new album. Although, I DO now like their older stuff, I am really glad that they took a ""heavier"" approach to their latest release... It has SO much more energy!"
4,Ok. But not one of their best work.,"Since i bought this album back in November 2004, i was so hooked up with the catchy songs inside this album especially The Happy Ending. But when i listened back for a few times, i don't see anything special about it. To me this album is just completely average. Go and buy their previous albums instead."
3,It'll grow on you,Phantom Planet's attempt to make a more aggressive album is ruined by poor production. Most of the tracks are too noisy ...
2,1st things 1st,"I really enjoyed ""The Guest"" and so picked this one up before reading reviews! Yikes! I like the track ""1st Things 1st"" with its thumping bass and sassy swagger. Otherwise the exit of Jason Swartzman leaves the band sounding loud, which isn't necessarily a negative, but loud for what? Unlike Alkaline Trio's ""Good Mourning"" that thrashes with violence and wit, this one just thrashes pointlessly. Do first things first, listen to track 4 and then set this one on the shelf. Taxi!"
4,Progressive,"Phantom Planet's new CD has a different sound from their last, more mainstream in my opinion, album. There are two songs that I have listened to over and over again that I can't get enough of, songs number 2 and 3. The rest of the CD is good but nothing legendary. Jason Schwartzman rules."
2,Self Titled Album by Phantom Planet,"Their attempts to record more agressive, garage sounding rock music fails. Phantom Planet, who are normally known for recording catchy pop tracks with a rock edge, come up short with the release of their latest album. Lack of direction & originality will frustrate fans who have warmed up to their SoCal formula & disappoint those who have stood by them for years. Lyrically the band is still decent, evident on ""The Happy Ending"" & ""After Hours"", but listening to these tracks will only make you yurn for songs like ""California"" even more."
2,"Why change the sound when ""The Guest"" sounded so great?","I am all for flexing your musical talents and not trying to repeat but everything that made ""The Guest"" so popular is gone including the catchy, dancable, singable songs.I dont like the new sound. I don't like blaring guitars and yelling.If I had known it was going to be such a departure I wouldnt have bought this.I think I will go back to ""The Guest,"" because this CD leaves a bad taste in my mouth."
2,"a sad, sad disappointment","Another example of a sophmore album failure in the music industry. And Phantom Planet has succumbed at an epic proportion. I was crazy excited to hear they had a new album out, and eagerly anticipated listening to it. But this sound is NOTHING like ""The Guest."" The reason they were successful - melodic with a bob-your-head style - has been ignored by the band and their producers, and the result is this mess of an album. Cheers for being different, but boohoo for being worse."
5,Phantom Planet Is Rocking,"Let me set the record straight, I've been with this band since Phantom Planet Is Missing, and it absolutely amazes me how a group this day in age can grow and mature the way these guys have. From the Elvis Costello like Pop of they're '98 release, to the Squeeze / Beatles combination heard on 02's The Guest, and now The Cure / The Clash combo illustrated through grinding guitar work and off balance vocals on the new Self Titled CD, it is clear that Phantom Planet is a band who doesn't like rehashing old matierial. These five rockers from California have finally come full circle and become a true to the blood, talented rock band that isn't afraid to try new things and experiment. I have absolute faith they will continue to grow and pound my ears with stunningly beutiful new releases in the many years to come. If you respect a true rock band, pick up Phantom Planet. They've only begun to show the world what they're made of."
4,A complete 180.,"Listen to Phantoms ""guest"", then listen to this new one. If you like different hard edged music, you wont regret this album. I gave this album four stars because I like the change in phantoms music (distorted garage sounds), but the lyrics are compromised. I am all for a bands growth change Phantom, Silverchair etc. The album has eleven songs and is at the discovery price, so its a win-win situation for a Phantom fan. GET IT! also if you like this, check out the Strokes."
5,Evolution,"Ok, if anyone is going out to buy this CD because you think it's going to sound like the Guest, it doesn't; but it's awesome all the same. When I first got the album, it didn't really make a good impression on me because the band sounded nothing like they did on the Guest. But I went and saw them live about 4 days after the release of the CD at Tower Records on Sunset in LA. Let me tell you, I am absolutely in love with the CD now. Alex Greenwald makes all of the songs come to life on stage, and I found myself actually singing along to the songs I didn't supposedly like. I especially love ""1st thing's 1st"", ""Making a Killing"", ""The Happy Ending"", and ""By the Bed."" The band has really grown and evolved on this album, and it's for the better. So don't count on the first listen of the CD to fall in love with it; give it a chance before slamming it. I know you'll like it, so go out and but it. NOW! :)"
3,The Change,"1998 - Two of my favorite bands are Phantom Planet who put out ""Is Missing"" and Kara's Flowers (who are now called Maroon 5.) We all know that Maroon 5 went from catchy pop-rockers to R&B, and now Phantom Planet has changed their style away from the tried and true. I'll agree with other reviewers: it's good, but not anywhere close to as good as ""Is Missing"" and ""The Guest."" Let's just cross our fingers that Fountains of Wayne's next album isn't Hardcore Rap."
3,this ain't your phantom planet,"ok, i reeaaaally didn't like this new sound from them. but on second listens i started to hear those melodies again, and i liked it. But i approached the cd not as Phantom Planet cause this isn't really them(atleast i hope not) and then i liked it because i didn't think of it as them. so it's still a good cd. but whenever i remember any song from the guest, i get super mad and angry at them for changing the awesome sound. but oh well, maybe the next cd will be a mix of both worlds..hopefully."
2,There was no need for a change...,"For starters, ""The Guest"" was a great album. I considered it a guilty pleasure because it wasn't really the type of sound that I featured in my CD player. In any case, I was excited to hear about the follow up and picked it up the first day it was released. I gotta say that I'm a bit disappointed. Many of the songs do sound the same, and I find that within the songs, there is lack of variety. I've given it a few run throughs and so far the only song that I like is ""By the Bed."" I understand that bands like to experiment to keep themselves entertained, but if it ain't broke, don't fix it. Phantom Planet had a good sound, with mass appeal. Their reinvention puts them out of their element. I really can't recommend this album to anyone."
4,ummm good stuff,"okay, i have a problem with people saying they're ripping the strokes off. i don't think they wrote the whole album and recorded it since ""Room On Fire"" came out. cause that's the closest the cd sounds like. and i know they've been working on the cd for awhile so them copying the strokes is way off(cause the first strokes cd is totally different)."
1,"Whoa, What Is This?","I bought this based on recommendations, and it was the first and LAST Phantom Planet CD I will ever buy. I wanted to stop listening after the first two songs, but I suffered through the whole thing, hoping it would get better.It didn't.The vocals are good, but the songs and music are not. The songs are strange, and don't flow together well at all.Not something I would recommend!"
1,Salt Soup,"When this product arrived I was shocked to see that the ""best before"" date was less than 2 months away. The reason I was surprised is because the first 4 ingediants listed are salt, monosodium glutamate, lactose and sugar. Yummy!"
1,Silicone nightmare,"After less than 2 months on my wife's iPod Mini, the silicon screen protector bonded to the glass and won't come off. No cleaners or solvents will remove it. The rest of the Jam Jacket does a decent job of protecting the iPod, but the design of that screen cover is very poor. If you have to get this, you'd better use a scissors and remove the screen cover first. Totally unacceptable."
1,I forgot to mention.,I forgot to mention the jamjacket has no vents in the back so it gets hot! that can make your battery leak. The iskin and Xtrememac have vents in the back so it keeps it cool.
2,There are better cases out there.,"The DLO jam jacket is one of the bad ipod mini skins on the market. This case is crap because it ripped so I tokk it off my mini and I dropped it so it broke. But I have a replacement now. The screen protector is slilicone so it sticks to the screen and it collects dust too much. I now have an Xtrememac clear ipod mini case. The silicone is thicker and it has better protection. It has no screen protector but i made a better screen protector for it. I don't recomend the Dlo Jam jacket for people who want to get their money's worthAlso one more thing, the jamjacket sticks to your ipod.I recomend The iskin or Xtrememac."
3,agree that it is a dust collector,"This thing is a dust magnet just like the other reviewer said, the jacket also kind of sucks the life out of the color of the mini and it is way less attractive with the jacket on. That said, my mini has taken 2 pretty good tumbles with the jacket on and the case is still flawless."
3,cover for my ipod mini,"I really like the customer serivce here, fast and easy!The price is also good, cheap and worth it!However, I found out my mini sometimes doesn't fit for the cover.It comes out a little bit, but after all, not bad!"
1,Dont buy this.,This is a horrible case. it always sticks to your iPod mini making funny looking marks on the screen. It still gets the iPod scratched and dirty. It also is difficult to take on and off.
4,"Good, when you get rid of the screen protector.","Overall this is a very good protective skin, but the screen protector is annoying. The screen protector makes it hard to see the screen. Since I use my ipod a lot, it might scratch or breal easier. My cousin has an ipod too but it has lots of scratches and it's slightly chipped. I got the skin so I could use it longer and noy break it. Even though it makes your ipod a bit bigger, you'll get used to it. If you want to take good care of your ipod, get this or anyother skin. Yuo'll not regret it.Directions if you want to remove the screen protector.Get a small sharp knife of some scissors and gently cut it."
3,You can place only once...,"Ok, so I didn't thoroughly think the placement through the first time and needed to move it a short time after first hanging it up. Well, you can't rehang due to the sticky backing only working the first time around. Jack, loves to rub up against corners and rough edges and would greatly enjoy this, but unfortunately it is now of no use until I find some other way of hanging it."
4,Heavy...,"Stumbled across this one while perusing the Dorobo catalogue. Loggerhead (aka Francois Tetaz and Milton M) have a few tracks that appear on some Dorobo comps. Took a while but finally tracked down their only full release.It's a startling surprise. Heavy bass experimentation. If I had to draw comparisons I'd lump it together in Tool, Soundgarden, Bill Laswell kind of hybrid. Really heavy. May not be the heavy born out of rage and more the kind of heavy of a bunch of educated guys experimenting with noise but it's heavy.Definitely worth checking out."
4,A facinating read,"When I picked this book up I planned to skim lightly. As soon as I read the first chapter, I was captured. I raced forward to see what was next. Each chapter grabbed me and held my attention. I wish I could learn to travel as the author does. I would recommend this book for anyone, but especially those who seek adventure. I look forward to future books on this same subject."
1,Couldn't ship it,"1 month after I ordered it, they finnaly told me they couldn't ship if to my APO address. After this, I cancled the order and am buying it from somewhere else."
4,Excellent Novel,"A mix of magic realism, gritty reality, pathos and wild comedy, ""April Fool's Day"" is one of the best novels I've read this year.On one level, the novel is a personalized history of Croatia (and Yugoslavia) from 1948 until the present. On another level it's the story of a disillusioned man's search for meaning. On another level, it's just plain fun.I won't give away any of the story here. But if you have a taste for absurdity and well written novels, give ""April Fool's Day"" a read."
3,Oskar in Czech Clothing,"I read a review that compared this book to Candide. I didn't think the protagonist much resembled the gentle, naive, good-hearted-but-not-very-intelligent character I remember from that book. Forrest Gump is like Candide; this character is more like Oskar from The Tin Drum. Although I found some sections of the book imaginative and astute such as those in which Ivan is sent to prison and what happens while he is there (but Solzhenitsyn does this better in One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich), overall the book was a disappointment to me. I didn't gain much new insight into either the ethnic struggles in the former Yugoslavia or human nature. I found the protagonist unlikable and while it is certainly possible to make humor work with an unlikable protagonist (such as in John Kennedy Toole's wonderful book, A Confederacy of Dunces), this book doesn't pull it off."
5,"""Dudley Moore Introduces, Saint-Saens Cello Concerto # 1.""","Once again I have been fortunate enough to acquire another classical performance in the series by Mr. Moore that was introduced by Thames Television International and The Learning Channel in 1993. Now out of print and available only through the used market.Mr. Steven Isserlis mastery of the cello is excellent, as far as my non-professional ears can tell, and I thoroughly enjoyed the performance and the conversations Mr. Moore had with the Conductor and Soloist."
3,Pleasant Japanese Tribute To George Harrison,"Gentle Guitar Dreams is a pleasant Japanese collection featuring a few unusual covers, but most of the songs are done in a style very similar to the original versions, making this collection not very compelling. Most of the credits are in Japanese so it is impossible to tell who is performing on most cuts.I Need You has a nice sort of electronic background. Far East Man is a clever song choice for a Japanese collection. Here Comes The Sun is a gret song with a perky arrangement which is different from the original. While My Guitar Gently Weeps is an orchestral instrumental with an interesting arrangement."
1,Many ingredients to be called a clear broth soup,"I was looking for a nice clear broth soup for lunch coming off of the master cleanse. I found these packets in my pantry at home. There are quite a few ingredients to be called a clear broth soup! Why add wheat and wheat gluten??? and monosodium glutamate? Now I have to look up succinic acid, sodium citrate, disodium inosinate, and disodium guanylate. Looks like alot of sugar and salt. You can do better than this Kikkoman. hmmm. Guess I will wait until I get home to have my home made veggie broth soup."
5,Old Schoolers Paradise,"if you are an old school gamer like myself this is a must have. I'm 24 and remember playing these games on my atari and in arcades. To start off they send not only pac-man but ms. pac-man our way. None of the graphics have been updated or changed and that is what makes this title great. I sit for hours on end trying to beat my high scores. I can't stop. I'm addicted. This collection also contains Pole Position, Galaga, and my personal favorite Dig-Dug. The one dud on this collection is Galaxian a far inferior game to Galaga.All I'm saying is, that if you want a great port of classic games this is the best one I have seen. The collection of games is terrific and you are sure to ""gobble"" up some of your free time with this on. Enjoy!"
3,Half decent at best,"Anyone who remembers the original series of Namco Museum compilations that first came out for the PS1 years ago remembers one of the best parts was the Museum feature itself in full 3-D where you ran around as Pac-Man selecting what game you wanted to play. All the DC version has is a select menu. Thats it. You'd figure with the space left over on the disc itself that Namco would port over a few other retro games, but no. Not to mention the emulator used to port the games was very poor, and the sound is god awful (much like with the compilation Sega Smash Pack also for the DC) and your only option will be to mute the volume. All in all, if you loved playing these old games and still have a DC this is worth a look, but others should run in the opposite direction."
1,Toshiba 32D46 Horizontal Line Problem,"I have owned this set for around 1.5 years. In the last couple of months, there has been an intermittant problem where the picture disappears and is reduced to a single horizontal line. Sometimes shutting off the TV and turning it back on works to make the problem temporarily disappear, and sometimes it takes multiple attempts to make this work. Sometimes we must unplug the set for 5 minutes and then turn back on to get the picture back. The set is out of warranty. The problem is occuring so often that I am starting to shop for a new set."
4,A Brooklyn Tale,"True to life story of a kid from Bensonhurst, who wants to be an actor, but is caught up in the rackets. Well acted all around, William DeMeo as Tony, Frank Adonis as Crazy Sal, and Ernest Mingione as Johnny command the screen. The viewer wants to see what these compelling figures will do next. Burt Young in a cameo, reminds us what a great actor he is. A little bit of Hollywood boy meets girl is thrown into the mix. The ending is surprising, but strangely gratifying."
5,"Great product, made in USA, skip the labels","I chose these jars over several others based on the reviews, glad I wasn't disappointed! Price (about $1.25 per jar) is actually better than the Container Store. Of course the 48 jar pack is a better value. I bought both the 48 and the 16. Glass is good quality, packing was solid, and made in America, yay! The shaker tops come in two sizes, half of each size. Jars fit most standard sizes of spice jars you can get in the grocery. I can't wait to start buying in bulk more and saving on spices while using less packaging materials.Amazon keeps recommending you buy the pre-printed labels as a ""get both for"" deal. I recommend skipping it unless you have a very basic spice collection. I picked up a few sheets of the return address labels and they look just fine. A little rubbing alcohol will take the labels off if you need to change them out. Or you can buy more jars!"
5,Exactly As Advertised,"I ordered a case of these bottles in November of 2010 and the case arrived with all 48 bottles, caps and sifters. No problems at all.I dry several items in my oven or food dryer that I can't find in my grocery store - mushrooms, lemon and lime rinds and wedges, tomotillos and more. I grind them in my blender to the desired coarseness and package them in these bottles. They are perfect for my uses. They are also great for holding home made rubs from mixed spices."
5,"Great, just what I needed","These are just the right size for my in-drawer spice racks. Buying spices in bulk saves a lot of money, so these will pay for themselves."
5,Great size,These fit perfectly in a top kitchen drawer. This is a much better way of organizing spices than having them in the cupboard. I bought two sets.
5,Great product,"I ordered these bottles to use for my dried herbs. They're perfect--not too big, but big enough so I can store a lot of herbs. The different size shaker caps are very handy and fit tightly.I don't really care that they didn't come with labels; I just write on the lid or bottle itself with a permanent marker, or a sticky label (that I already have).I'm especially happy that they're made in USA. I had a hard time finding glass bottles made here, so I was thrilled that I could find these."
5,Worth every penny,"I had been buying these individually at the health food store as I added to my spice collection. They were always running out or getting different types and then I decided to check amazon. It seemed like a ton of spice jars, but now I have an extra 6 or 7 for new spices I may encounter. Very happy with the quality and size of these jars!"
4,A Little Small,"I had trouble envisioning how much spice each bottle would hold. I wish they were a little larger. The caps and lids are great, just as described."
4,"Good value, but don't work with spice clips","The jars are not heavy duty, but they are sturdy and a good value for the price. I received an even number of lids with big holes and small holes (didn't realize there was an option when I purchased though they show both in the product photo).I purchased the jars to use with theSpiceStor Organizer 20 Cabinet Door Clips, but unfortunately they keep sliding out of the clips."
4,nice bottles,The shipment came quickly and were exactly as described. The only way to improve would be to lower the price.
4,Almost perfect,"The set's caps came in two sizes, one with small holes and another with big holes. The big hole caps were too big to use on most of my spices. They were good for peppercorns, crushed peppers, fennel seeds, etc. I wished the entire set came in small holes, as these were more fitting to the seasonings I use, such as lemon pepper, or other ground spices. I didn't see any self-adhesive labels in the box, so I created my own. I buy all my spices from Penzeys Spices ([...]) and now I can save money by buying in bagful. Thanks, Amazon.com!"
1,Product apparently doesn't exist,"Be Aware Before you Order! On Oct. 31, 2006 I ordered two cases of bottles through Amazon, to be delivered from Stacks and Stacks. When they arrived, the cases were only 16 count instead of 48 count. I called Stacks and Stacks and a supervisor was to return my call, I received an email instead (supervisor claimed my home number was a fax). She offered to credit me shipping cost ($18.47 for the heavier weight boxes - the 16 count boxes are only 5.99 to ship)if I wanted to keep the boxes, otherwise they would arrange to pick them up. She claimed that J.K. Adams does not make a 48 ct case. I responded that I wished to return the boxes (I had less than half of the bottles I needed, and the cost per bottle was now more than doubled). I have since written two more times and as of 11/16/06 have received no response, no instructions to return, and no credit to my account. I have filed a claim with Amazon A-Z Guarantee, hopefully this will be resolved soon."
1,SCAM!!!,"I too ordered the ""case"" of bottles. I received 16, not 48 and two of those were broken. repeated attempts to get it fixed have gone unanswered!!"
4,You get whats described,"I used these as gifts and they worked well - didn't leak or spill, but they are nothing special. Worked well for what I needed."
4,Height of Botltles,Does anyone know the height of these bottles? I want to stand them up in a drawer but could not locate the dimensions.
5,I Love these!,"Great bottles. Heavy weight, solid fit on the lids. The caps provided aren't the best size for the spices I've put in them so far but the jars are awesome!"
2,undersize,"Bought these jars expecting them to be direct replacements for some spice bottles. They are 1/2"" shorter and don't hold all the contents of a standard spice bottle so I sent them back. Calling them spice bottles would lead one to believe they are a direct replacement for the ones in the store spice rack; they aren't"
5,Awesome Spice Jars,"They are sturdy, good looking jars. My spice cabinet is officially organized thanks to these. They also store a decent amount. I recommend this set if you don't already have spice jars."
3,Not practical with large holes in covers,I wanted tops with small holes and there were only ones wiith large holes?Not practical for spices with all large holes in the covers. Let me know if I can orderones with small holes.
4,Good ordinary spice jars,"These came in perfect condition, from Vermont all the way to California. Good product, exactly as advertised."
1,Even Amazon itself can't get this right.,"The previous reviewers seem to have ordered from a marketplace seller, but I ordered my set of 48 bottles, caps, and sifters directly from Amazon. At the time of ordering the product was supposedly in-stock, eligible for Prime, and would ship that day. So I ordered.Then the fun began. I got a confirmation email saying it would arrive in two days. Then the order status changed several times--first it was delayed, then shipping on time, then delayed again, then shipping--all in the course of 24-48 hours. When the product finally showed up, late, it was just 48 caps and sifters, no bottles. The label on the box from the warehouse is clearly wrong. Why can't Amazon get this right?"
1,Too small - all over,The jars hold about the same as the average store bought spices. The top is too narrow to insert a teaspoon and the large holed shaker top is too small to shake out seeds (e.g. cumin or red pepper flakes)
3,Wait for the 30th anniversdary release in 2008,"A disappointing product. Rumor has it, plans are to release a cd/dvd set in 2008 in the manner as the ""Arrival"" release. It is quite incredible. Overall, ""The Album"" is a much better piece of music as a whole. Side one is ABBA at their most flawless."
3,This CD looks like a CDR.,This CD looks like a CDR due to the exceptionally poor artwork on the silk screen. All it is a harshly painted copyright label and silver color the rest of it. The label got the nerve to produce something like this title. CD sounds OK.
1,Beware of this book!!,"Beware of this book!! I bought this book to review the industrial engineering portion. After wasting my time working through several chapters, I finally discarded it. This book is so full of errors that it does more harm than good. I have the fourth edition. One would think that errors would be corrected with each new edition. The author should be embarrassed to have his name on something so completely useless. I want my money back!"
3,Needed more,This video is a teaser. Great footage of a soon to be historical film. Wish it had more shorter clips. These two are masters but I would like to see more small interaction and lessons or drills. Maybe there is some unseen footage that will soon appear on the web.
1,Not worth the money,"This thick book consists mainly of information and pictures that you can find in a lot of other and better books.Text is poor, pictures have bad quality and no details at all.I'm sorry I spent my money on this..."
3,Skippable Boxing Book...,"This book is a solid book of Boxing champions until the 1970s. However, virtually all the material covered in this book can be found in ""An Illustrated History of Boxing"" by Nat Fleischer, which is a vastly superior 'Encyclopedia' of Boxing. I originally gave this three stars, although now I wish I had given it two, as it is the weakest Boxing book I got in some time..."
5,perfect,"perfect, modern, resistence, arrived on time, resistence, love ir, recived on time, price less, confurtable, beautifull, perfect, on time, prety"
4,Necessary Reading,"I'd put this book on the must-read book for management books. The reason is not so much how to master the corporate political techniques the book explains. Rather, this book identifies the most common methods so that you may be aware of them, so that you can recognize them and better counter them. Not so many people corporate backstabbers trying to get their way to the top, but no one wants to be bushwacked by an eager-beaver just playing the right games. So, I'd read this book for the great defensive leasons, instead of employing it as on offensive tool towards your way to the top."
4,Insightful!,"As the book jacket states, ""There are plenty of books out there that show you how to climb the corporate ladder by applying the good old-fashioned virtues of honesty, integrity, loyalty and hard work. This book isn't one of those."" In fact, this manual isn't for the faint of heart. It contains some of the nastiest, dirtiest tricks around for getting ahead, including how to punish your subordinates, take your supervisor's job and spread vicious rumors. Although the battle imagery can be grating, what the author writes is (unfortunately) usually true. Those climbing the corporate ladder will benefit from his advice. Those already at the top apparently already know everything in this book. Still, it's entertaining and easy to read - perfect for lunchtime. We at getAbstract recommend this book for corporate climbers willing to do what it takes."
5,Workin' for the Man,"Looking back now, I can't believe I naively thought management really wanted feedback, input and insight to the day-to-day operations from a hard-working, independent thinking individual like myself and some of my co-workers. After being duly chastised for bringing up concerns about a new ""direction"" the department was headed, I almost quit. I remembered a co-worker talking about this book. I ordered it as soon as I left the office that day (along with Sun Tzu's ""Art of War""). I got it last night and I can't put it down. This is the straight dope on the Man. It ain't pretty, but it fully explains many of the decisons and actions of management on all levels. The kid gloves and rose-colored glasses are off."
3,Mostly on how to evade responsibility,The author mostly gives you techniques of evading responsibility.How to buy time and/or spill the blame on others.
1,Save your money!,"Unless you are a complete idiot, you already know everything this book has to offer. If you have spent any time at all in the corporate environment, this is all day-to-day stuff here. Couldn't be more boring and obvious.Purchase this book only if you are interested in reading stories from the authors personal work history as he tries to relate it to the so called ""tactics"" in the book.Complete waste."
3,N.Y.C. House Music mid 1990's,"A platter of tunes from the legendary ""Eightball Records"" record store/label. Half of the tracks are timeless, half are dated...I would get it just to mix the tunes myself on a computer ""DJ"" program."
3,Not Too Bad a Way to Pass the Time,If you're into sci-fi and action you may find this one reasonably entertaining. It combines an interesting disaster danger that I have not seen before so I give it credit for some originality. The acting varies from good to adequate but even the weakest of the actors is not so bad as to interfere with the flow of the story. I've seen it once now and will probably not watch it again for a long time.It's rated PG but is generally suitable for anyone in the familly who likes sci-fi action flicks.
1,WATCH OUT FOR FALLING TOASTERS!,"Anytime you put the SyFy Channel and The Asylum together, you know you're going to get a typically cheesy picture with mediocre acting, a nonsensical script and bad effects....but most of the time you end up enjoying them on a guilty pleasure excuse.Alas, not so with METAL TORNADO, a really dull movie, punctuated with ridiculous fx, truly stupid plotting and embarassingly bad acting from Lou Diamond Phillips, Nicole deBoer and Greg Evigan.A definite waste of time or money!"
4,metal tornado,cool movienot sure if this would ever be posible but if it could happen i would not want to antwhere around.
5,Game You will enjoy,"This game can get really challenging at first. There are tons of challenging levels to enjoy. My favorite one is when you get to ride on a little roler coster type thing. You have to collect all the coins and on the track there are ""Wampies"" which are little teddy bears that give you a life or when you dye you lose one of your wampies. I think you will personally enjoy this game."
2,not what you'll be expecting,The emperors new groove may look fun but its a rip off. It has pretty good graphics and role play is good too but its not a challenge. You'll probably beat the whole game in a few hours.My advice to ypu is just save your money and buy something else.
3,santa clara,"I bought this CD because I liked the song.""sanas"" I mean you cannot get it anywhere. not even on Itunes. .. thats the only song I heard on the CD with gustavo laureano I wonder what Santa Clara is doing? is she a real singer now? what !answer me santa clara"
1,Sad,"Disturbed are my rock gods ever since i saw them in PA with MAWII i have seen them in serveral concerts since then, and to be honest i really like hearing tributes to bands its cool hear the same great song brought to you differently. However this is a horrible ""tribute"" to start the vocals over power all the music and i can live with that to be honest but when the vocalist is this bad it only makes it painful to listen to, then when you can hear the music over the shrills of a dieing cat they seems to completely lose any ""feel"" of disturbed. want a cool disturbed tribute check out the ""Are You Breathing"" string quartet no vocals but an awesome ""disturbed feel"""
1,do not buy this,I dont take these ''gothic tributes'' serious anymore. It's only good for a laugh or something.I used to be a Disturbed-fan..now I think it's still..pretty decent.But this is just total murdering of Disturbed's music.I dont think this is a tribute AT ALL.But I think this one is 1% better than that one of Linkin Park.
4,Catchy and Bouncy!,"An extremely catchy bunch of songs by the prince of ""hummable"" himself, Cy Coleman. The songs vary from vaudeville, to country, to 70's schmaltz pop. The c.d features performances by Tony winners Joanna Gleason and James Naughton. Once you listen to this c.d, I guarantee that you'll be humming along to ""Love's Revolution"" and bopping away to ""Hey There, Good Times"". It's Coleman, so go ahead and buy it!"
5,A Wonderful Story for Fantasy Fans,"I was lucky enough to stumble across this book before the holidays, and promptly ordered it along with several other books that were influences to Tolkien. This book is the one I started with. It contains two stories, both of which are wonderfully written. They are written using an older form of English, but once you get used to the dialect you will become fully immersed in the story.I gave this review 5-stars only because of how great the stories are. The formatting of this book is horrible. It is the size of a textbook with 2 columns per page. I think it would have been better using a standard paperback format, but this seems to be the only available edition out, so look past this and enjoy the amazing stories!"
2,Must have been hilarious in its day,"I read this book for the first time a few months ago after many years of hearing about it. The prose is good and it is very readable, but it is EXTREMELY dated! The ideas put forth in it are a humorous critique of the state of American religious ""politics"" several decades ago. Much of the humor has lost its power because the issue and proclivities of religious politics has been transformed in the past 30-40 years. It serves as a snapshot of the past, but it is no longer a funny book. I also found that the author is just a bit snide of his treatment of some denominations and keeps some of his sharpest sarcasm for those groups he seems to dislike personally. I would recommend the book as a period piece for younger people and as a bit of nostalgia for people who remember the often unintentionally funny attitudes of the 1950-1970 era of Mainline American Protestantism."
5,The wonderful world of dolls!,"I loved this book as a child and now my own daughter loves it (and my son too)! The marvelous imagination of this book and the dolls that come to life when Big Susan isn't around is phenomenal! I would recommend this book to anyone, especially for those little girls at heart like myself :) It's a great read for young and old and perfect for Christmas."
5,"Such a delightful, wonderful little book!","I would have adored this book had I read it as a child. I am so pleased to have found this treasure to read to my children (ages 4 and 6). After reading this magical and touching little book, even my 6 year old son was inspired to play with our oft-forgotten dollhouse. They were off to tidy up the dollhouse which had been neglected so that the dolls would be happier. Thank you to Purple House Press for reprinting this lovely book, and for all the other out of print treasures you have reprinted!"
4,Big Susan Bought for a Friend,"I bought this book for a friend, she had remember it from the school library when she was in school back in the 50s. She could not remember the name of the book only that it was about dolls that come to life on Christmas Eve. I did some Googling and came up with the book Big Susan. At first she was sure it was not the same book because she did not think that was the name of the book. We ordered the book with some skepticism. After rereading Big Susan she was thrilled to find out she had found an old friend and was very pleased with it. She would recommend it to any child, or adult too for that matter who loves doll as she does."
3,Very interesting but not variety of sound that I'd hoped for,"I'd give this CD 3 1/2 stars because of the way so many songs had a very similar sound to them (although being able to understand Apache would no doubt help that).You get 25 songs,each with what seems like the same drum work although some did seem to have some tambourine backup, and a total of 12 different singers. The late Philip Cassadore sang the first 8,and his sister Patsy ( I prefer her singing over his)#14-21, in 1966, the others were done in 1976 & 86 all are equally clear.# 11 With My Prayer I am Protected by Edwin Endfield was one of the best songs in my opinion. Most of the songs are very traditional, some of them are very good, buy it for those reasons."
3,Beware: not USB enabled!!!!,"The keyboard and mouse work well and are reasonable ofr the price but beware!!!!! They are not USB compatible and require ps-2 connections. If your laptop does not have the old ps-2 connectors then you will end up buying an adaptor which costs almost as much as the keyboard-mouse combo itself!Also, my understanding was that the mouse was an optical device: it is NOT! it works fine but has the usual limitations of the mice using the old rolling ball technology.So, buy it with your eyes open!"
3,VERY Disappointed in this Product,"I just bought this combo yesterday and the installation was a nightmare and the mouse still does not work, nor do the hot keys on the keyboard. The installation cd that came with the set apparently was either bad or did not have the complete programs. I had to go online to the website and download the drivers and still the mouse and hot keys do not work. i sent an email last night to the support at Micro Innovations and tonight I still have not had any type of reply. I have used a wireless optical mouse for along time and wanted to upgrade to a wireless keyboard and thought this was the best deal. Apparently I was wrong. Can't decide whether to wait for a reply or just take the crap back!"
2,Not as it seems,The Sister Sledge Collection is not what it appears to be. The songs on the CD were all remakes of the originals--and bad remakes at that! All of them have this 80's soft-cheesy- synth-sound which takes out the hard edge groove that makes a S.S. song so appealing in the first place. Avoid this CD--unless you enjoy cheesy synth music.
5,Rocking Around the Clock.,"This album doesn't contain much original music; most of the songs are familiar tunes reworded and remixed a little so that they fit in the world of Bob the Builder and are okay for children to listen to. However, the songs work exceedingly well! There are a few original tunes here, including the two songs that Spud sings. I also enjoyed listening to the re-mix of the Bob the Builder theme ""Can We Fix It?"" and the cast singing with Elton John on ""Crocodile Rock"" is a hoot. Some of my favorite songs on the album include:""Right Tool for the Job""""Dizzy!""""What Can I Be? (Spud's Song)""""Let's Get Busy""""No Prob Bob""Overall, a really good collection of music aimed at kids, but that adults will probably like just as much if not more."
4,looked for this everywhere & finally found it on Amazon,"My husband wanted to make a dish requiring Chinese 5 spice powder. I looked for it at all my local grocery stores: Ralph's, Whole Foods, Trader Joe's. None of them carried it. I probably could have gone to an Asian grocery store. But it was extremely convenient to just buy it here on Amazon and at a good price, too. Apparently, it is not real Chinese Five Spice Powder if it doesn't specifically have ""Chinese"" and ""Five"" in the title on the label."
4,The Smell is Incredible,"The product came quite quickly. The smell is awesome. I have tried it on a few pieces of meat, but I am looking forward to learning how to incorporate this spice into more of my dishes."
3,never bought this,"never bought this so i cannot give a review at this timeso please stop asking me to review this item i ckeck mypantry and this is not in it,thank"
1,Product almost past freshest by date on arrival!,When I received shipment there was less than 3 months left till freshest by date. Ridiculous. This is going back.
1,Painfully bad!,I just saw this show at my local theatre and it is probably the worst and least funny musical I have ever seen. Unfortunately I won the CD in a raffle and played it later on. The ordinary and bland music and inane lyrics and dialogue brought back painful memories of sitting through this show. Maybe some people will like this type of musical and I wish I could give them the CD but the three other people I went with also thought it was a total unfunny bore.
5,Live Jazz at it's best!,"If you love live jazz,uncut, raw,( not watered down)this C.D. is for you.Mr Osby comes out roaring and doesn't stop until the disc ends.This C.D. represents what I love about jazz.The freedom to play music from your heart and soul and evoke feelings in the listener that gives you chills!ART FOR YOUR EARS.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"
2,2.4V isn't enough,"I bought this with the idea that I'd extend the battery life of my Palm TX on long flights. The 4 AA batteries are set up as two sets in parallel, so you have 3V output with Alkalines and 2.4V with rechargable batteries.Unfortunately, I found that with 4 NiMH AAs, it charges the TX very slowly if I'm not using the PDA, but doesn't provide enough power to use the Palm while the Palm's batteries are low.It might work with Alkalines, but maybe not. The USB standard calls for 5V from the USB port. I'm going to go look for another USB battery pack that provides closer to the 5V standard.- Gus"
4,Good Book,Its a very good read if you are a Sam Burrack fan. If you havn't read one about him before this is a great start.
4,'it's tricky to rock around',"four tracks...eleven bucks? steep price but if you are a fan it's definitely worth it. the first three tracks are very fresh they would have fit on the juxtapose album, last track is from the angels with dirty faces period and man is it phat. great ep, can't wait for a full length album."
1,Drivel,"barely worth the plastic the cd is pressed on. all four tracks sound terrible-intolerable.. and very much an imitation of the dirty south made unpopular by the 'artists' on the cash money label.tracks are aggressive, repetitive and uninteresting. don't buy it."
3,Somewhat blah looking,"Nice composition, however somewhat bland in appearance. With the addition of some more colorful stones creates a more pleasing appearance"
2,Environmentally hazardous packaging,"I agree with the previous reviewers about the size of the candles - TOO small and unimpressive for the price! In fact, seems like all candles from Bealle Florida (I bought more than one directly from their web site - all at once... would not buy again...) are WAY smaller than the way they are photographed. Not bad, just greatly misrepresented. And what customer enjoys being fooled?But the overpriced tiny candles are not the worst part. What really upset me was the environmentally hazardous packaging they came in - not so much the candle boxes themselves, but the TONS of plastic around them!!! I understand that the shipping folks want to provide cushioned packaging for their tiny candle sets, but they could use recycled paper for that or some other environmentally-friendly material... The amount of plastic that came with these candles was scary. In fact, the candle sets were almost lost in the sea of plastic. Just awful."
2,you won't learn to draw people from this book,"This book is mainly a group of images with the author discussing how to draw them step by step. However, there are very few tips about ""how"" to successfully draw them. The biggest tip in this book, which is repeated several times, is the number of head lengths in an adult or child's body, which IS a good tip, however I'd have expected manymore. The rest of the ""tips"" are more like: ""draw this and be careful not to..."" or ""when sketching this use the negative space to find the shapes"" - these are all good tips, if you're in a classroom with a teacher who is pointing at your drawing, but not helpful or useful in a book. This book is light on information.Finally, the thing that made me realize this just wasn't going to work was the fact that the author's drawings aren't really that good, in particular the faces are not drawn accurately to the photo images.I'm sure there are better books out there."
4,richard donner sure does know how to make sequels!,"the lethal weapon sequels prove that sequels DO work. sadly,this is probably the last film in the series. the plot has to do with an asian crime family."
2,"Lots of unrealistic action scenes & contrived comedy, acting","This movie has the same, typical lethal weapon plot. There's an ""impressive"" beginning, lots of ridiculous comedy in the middle (Chris Rock is annoying as a loose frog on a flea farm), they get ambushed by the bad guys, and then the lethal weapon ending when Riggs and Mertae single-handedly out-duke the bad guy whipersnappers. That's to be expected. Each ""actor"" just seemed to be reading the lines. The action scenes were unrealistic, to say the least. I think that 1 and 2 are much better. #3 was worse....this one beats #3 by far (in being poor)."
2,what a waste of time and money renting this one,"Why did they even bother making another Lethal Weapon movie? Did they have some explosives and pyrotechnics left over and want to use them up? I guess Chris Rock was added to the cast so that Joe Pesci had someone to swear with. Was Rene Russo even in this one? No plot, an overabundance of extremely fowl language(you won't want the kids near this one) and lots of noise. I watched most of it on fast forward so I only suffered about 1.5 hours. If we are lucky, maybe this will finally be the last one before it becomes a real farce."
4,attention les francais!!!,"la version francaise de l'arme fatale 4 de la region 1 est en fait la version canadienne ce qui ne pose pas de problemes mais peut surprendre car les voix ne sont pas les memes qu'en france,mais ne vous inquietez pas on n'entend quasiment pas l'accent!"
2,Possibly the worst of the Lethal Weapon Series,"The stunts and action scenes are good, but the PLOT!!! It's almost like a Three Stooges Movie at times. Joe Pesci and Chris Rock curse at each other throughout the movie, for no apparent reason. Get the NEGOTIATOR, you'll be much more satisfied."
1,I would give it zero stars if I could,"Danny Glover is one of my favorite actors. I loved him in Predator 2 and all of those movies. Then Lethal Weapon 1, 2 and 3 came and I loved them. Mel Gibson was great with Danny Glover. Then in 1998 they had to pull that Chris Rock and put him in it. My friend likes # 4 just becuase Chris Rock is in it. They destroyed all the lethal weapons when they added these fools. If they left it at 3 everyone would look back and see Mel Gibson and Danny Glover. One Physco and one nice dressed cop. The only thing that Chris Rock and Joe Pecci can do is curse. Please don't get this movie becuase you won't like it unless you like a movie with a bad plot and a lot of cursing."
2,Ugh,"Why a number 4? Instead of trying something fresh with the series, we get retread material. It's so obvious throughout this marketing-scheme of a movie that the only intention is to give the audience what the filmmakers believe they want. The results are gratuitous scenes of Joe Pesci being loud and unfunny, playing faithfully on the beaten-to-death ""They #$%! you at the drive-thru"" bit, along with Chris Rock throwing in his motormouth, all featuring dialogue that isn't nearly as fresh as the first two films. Give credit for the taming of Riggs' character and to Jet Li, a truly talented martial arts expert who steals every scene he is in."
3,LETHAL BUT ONLY JUST,"The best thing about these films is you know what you're going to get. If you just fancy some action, good fight scenes, explosions, a lilltle love interest and comedy all wrapped up in a good guys and bad guys movie then this is for you. There is a plot regarding smuggling people, but it's incidental. Yhe movie plays on the familiarity of the two central characters. This being no 4 it's almost a soap. Joe Pesci delivers the best lines and manages to become more endearing and annoying as the film goes on. Hopefully they will stop at 4, and the Lethal Weapon series will be given the credit it deserves. Lethal Weapon 5 would be just one more than we really need. In a nutshell if you liked any of the others buy it. If you didn't you won't like this one either. Region 2 actually has some decent extras for a change. Thanks guys"
5,"Oh yummy, Mel Gibson","Their Back!Martin Riggs and Roger Murtaugh are back, and I seriously don't think that their getting to old for this. In fact, Riggs might be getting married, and Laurna is pregnant, so is Rianne. In the hit sequel to Lethal Weapon 3, Riggs and Murtaugh are caught in a smugglers plan, when Murtaugh brings home a family that were being smuggled ino the U.S. Sparks fly as a fast-moving bad guy (Jet Li) makes their lives miserable. And they have to catch them before he destroys their familes."
4,Great ending to the series!,"When I first heard that there was to be a Lethal Weapon 4, I was a wee bit skeptical. However, when I finally saw it I was definitely not dissappointed! Glover and Gibson were still the perfect team and the addition of Jet Li (my personal favorite) enriched the experience immensely.The only reason I didn't give the film 5 stars, was that Chris Rock's performance was a bit annoying at times."
5,The best of the LW movies,"LW1 was awesome. LW2 was pretty good. LW3 sucked. See a pattern here? LW4 sure turned that around. The action and humor were fantastic! Although I will have to say that the writers could have backed down on the ""F"" word. This movie cusses more than Die Hard does! Still, it was awesome."
5,should be to do make a fifth part,"I have seen all the movies of Mel and I am waiting to buy Lethal Weapon 4 in Video. I `ve the three first and the soundtracks. I think that Richard Donner is an excellent director and the actors, too. I like Rene Russo very much."
2,A movie too far,"Lethal Weapon was great, so too was LW2 and LW3 maintained the spark. Sadly/strangely, it looks like the creative team ran out of ideas and no wonder this one is believed to be the last of the series.An attempt to ""soften"" the movie with elements of unasked for ""moving human drama"" detract from the light escapism of the earlier movies. The trend for the writers and actors to take themselves increasingly seriously has now become impossible to ignore and is incongruous in what was never intended to be a serious themed ""shoot em up"" cop/buddy movie series.Fans of LW 1-3 will probably watch the movie anyway, as did I, but they'll be disappointed at the end, as was I."
2,Enough Already!,"The Lethal Weapon series should have stopped at the second movie. The last two was just a comedy show to me, and I didn't like how the script sort of mocked the Asian culture with a couple of tasteless jokes. However, I did enjoy watching Jet Li showing unbelievable martial art skills and I am looking forward to seeing more of him!"
1,a truly terrible movie,"I agree - this was a ""long verbal assault"", full of ""inane trash-talk."" I'm glad I'm not the only one that nearly winced at the ""unnecessarily racist"" jabber (supposedly Gibson's charachter trying to psych out the bad guys). Pesci and Rock were utterly useless. And what a waste of Jet Li's talent. Yet, he did more acting with his cold stare than Glover and Gibson could do in all their asinine yammering. What was the point of Russo's last scene? Glover, Gibson, Russo, Donner and Silver should be ashamed. I'm glad I only watched the rented DVD at someone else's house."
1,This headache-inducing junk is for diehard LW fans only!,"This was such a verbal assault on the viewers--two plus hours of screeching, screaming, shouting, arguing, swearing--come on guys, good actors all, lost in a way-too-long self-indulgent farce. This could have been a decent, timely story if the producers/writers had taken a bit of care. There were some truly interesting effects, some genuine moments of humor, and a few cases of true suspense. But all the good stuff was overshadowed by inane trash-talk. This is a mockery of the original Lethal Weapon, and continues the three stooges aspect of LW3. Only the stooges were honestly funny."
3,"GOOD, BUT NOT ENOUGH!!!!!!!!","I didn't think that it was *that* good. It was okay, but it just didn't seem like the old ones. Mel wasn't his old crazy self. And he couldn't fight in this one, I thought he was an ex-marine and trained in fighting. He was just a whimp in this one. I'm giving it three stars because I loved the end when Gibson and Glover fought with Jet Li."
4,lethal's back with a bang !,"If you thought lethal weapon 3 was distinctly average and going to give this one a miss like myself, think again,as i think you'll be surprised.It's of course the same tried and tested formula but it works great largely because of the wonderful jet li and the hilarious scenes with chris rock.This is actually the funniest weapon to date and the interplay between the characters is great.The story itself is not too original , but hey , neither was the first lethal weapon ! . All in all this is a great movie with lots of humor thrown in for good measure , and if you don't laugh at the glover/rock gay scenario youre just not human !!"
2,"Could be better, but overall not bad.","I can agree with P. Burdette's review to a certain extent. Lethal Weapon 4 could have been better, and I do think this film is vastly inferior to any of its predecessors, but overall, it isnt too bad. I appreciate comedy, even in an action movie, but I think they went way overboard with it. Like that scene where Murtaugh gloated that he was boinking Ebony Clark DURING A GUNFIGHT!!!, like any normal person would think about that while being shot at. The acting isn't as good as in the first 3 movies, but not bad enough to ruin the film. LW isn't a bad way to kill a few hours if you're bored, but nothing worth making a special effort to see."
4,"""THE GANG'S ALL HERE.""","Personally I love all of the Lethal Weapon movies but with Jet Li, Chris Rock, and Joe Pesci in the mix with Mel Gibson, Danny Glover, and Rene Russo? I would definnitly love this one with all of it's deleted seens and movie commertals all from Lethal Weapons 1, 2, and 3. I would recommend this one to anybody who loves the lethal weapon trilogy."
2,You'll laugh but that's about it,"The Lethal Weapon movies have all offered their share of action, drama and comedy, Part 4 however is high in comedy but low in everything else. Riggs and Mortar just come off as complete bafoons this time around. In the other films it has been obvious that Riggs has a thing for the 3 Stooges it's very obvious this time because he never lets up, don't think their is one scene where he acts serious. I've always enjoyed seeing Riggs and Mortar beating the bad guys but this time for some reason I enjoyed seeing Jet Li kicking their butts around... Plus the only drama it actually offers is Joe Pesci talking about his dead frog named ....froggy that he accidently ran over with his bike. It's obvious that this one was just made in the sake of just making another one. Mel's so not in the part that he doesn't have the long hair this time around either and what is Riggs without the hair ? A wimp actually."
3,"Not As Lethal As Others, But Still Fun","It's been six years since we last saw Riggs and Murtaugh and, fortunatley for us, nothing much has changed. Do we really want it too?. This is, without a doubt, the weakest entry in the very popular and successful series. The plot is paper thin and isn't too interesting to really care about. The usual. It's Mel and Danny who, as always, are the only captivating presences in the film. Jet Li, as the main bad guy, has impressive martial art skills, but has little else to offer. He had nothing much to go with here and didn't really need much acting to do. Just as this movie was the weakest entry in the series, Jet Li's villain was the weakest one in the series as well. They could've used him to a much better effect. Joe Pesci is back to bring even more comedic relief. Chris Rock is okay, but just doesn't seem to fit. He is more annoying than anything else. The action scenes are great, as usual, and are lots of fun. For fans only."
5,My favortite movie of all time!,"This movie fit the rest of the Lethal Weapon series, but I think it was the best of the series. This movie had action and humor, to me that is what every movie should have!"
3,Great transfer. Awful plot (or lack thereof),"First, this movie has awesome sound and video transfer, along with some genuinely phenomenal action and humor. Unfortunately, those moments of comedic and combative bliss are FEW and VERY FAR BETWEEN. Jet Li is the star here, and I would very much like to see more of his brand of action on the screen, but Glover and Gibson seem tired.A great ensemble cast can't breathe life into this done-once-too-many-times storyline that won't seem to die.I highly recommend renting it, if only to experience the superb audio and video. But don't buy it. Its not a collector-worthy expenditure, in my opinion."
4,It was great !!!!,"I only had one problem with this movie, I have seen it 3 other times in past movies called Lethal Weapon. Other then that it was a fun movie that I would suggest to any one."
1,A truly terrible movie!,"This is easily the worst of the Lethal Weapon series. By this point, the interplay between Mel Gibson and Danny Glover is annoying. Joe Pesci is irritating, not funny. The script and characters are politically correct, and not realistic. Finally, the language would make a sailor blush. The only redeeming feature is the bad guy."
1,Jet Li Stomps Mel Wimpson Into Nothingness!!!,"This movie stunk! The only good part about it was Jet Li. And what made it even better was watching him beat the snot out of Mel Gibson on more than one occasion. I laughed everytime. Jet Li is the true star of this flick. Mel is a weenie, predictable and pretty much an idiot throughout the entire film. Go watch ""Fist of Legend"" for some real action."
2,Hypocrits in action,Danny and Mel at it again. This time a weak plot smacks of PC and the Anti NRA poster wrongfully blames the NRA for child related firearms deaths. I would not own this peice of pronaganda if it were a gift. The hollywood elites Make billions with Gun movies and then pull this mess.
4,"Mel Gibson,Danny GloverJoe Pesci,Rene Russo,Chris Rock, and Jet Li (3.5/5)","out of all four movies in the series,this is probably the loudest andmost chaotic,but that doesn't mean it was a bad movie.i think thestoryline was a bit thin and not really all that original,but just likein part three,the action,and the chemistry of the stars makes up forthat.and this movie also has more laughs than the previousinstallments,many courtesy of both Joe Pesci and Chris Rock.Rene Russois back,along with Mel and Danny.Jet Li joins the proceedings in thisone,and brings some spectacular fight scenes courtesy of his martialarts skill.i don't know if this is the best of the series,but i thoughtit was as good as number three,which i really liked.for me,LethalWeapon 4 is a 3.5/5"
3,Last hurrah for Riggs and Murtough,"Ok. The plots of these movies are getting really stupid, but Richard Donner sure knows how to choreograph the action. Jet Li alone is reason enough to see this movie. Some good car chases, too. I DO wish they had used Chris Rock a little better. Donner never really cut him loose.Worth a look, but don't expect too much."
2,I was laughing at the movie not with it!,"Oooooh,this movie was silly! Now, Danny Glover and Mel Gibson made the best interracial screen pair in the last 15 years. Watching the first one, even on TV, is still entertaining. But this one: it is way over the top and too unbelievable! Really, the only thing worth seeing about this movie is the interplay between Glover and Rock. Glover and Gibson don't seem to have that magic. Maybe because Glover seems to follow Gibson's every command-- remember, from the first movie, Gibson is a certified nut! I hope this is the last! What this one will make you do is run to the video store to get the original!"
3,Jet Li Rocks. The Sound does not.,"We all know that DVD will always be inferior, sound wise, to Laser Discs,but this is ridiculous. This is the WORST sounding DVD I've heard yet. All the bass in the world can't make up for the tinny sound effects or the inconsistent dialouge. This is also the only Lethal Weapon DVD that doesn't offer a pan and scan version. Instead it has some lame cut scenes from the previous films. Which I wouldn't have minded so much, but they left out the barfight. The trailer for the original Lethal Weapon shows Riggs kicking some poor slobs ass in a barfight. If a DVD is gonna show missing scenes, that's the one I wanna see. Anyway, cool flick, bad realease."
3,Lethal Fun,"Lethal Weapon 4 is an improvement over the third film but just barely. The tone is a lot like ""Lethal 2"", funny, fast paced and a lot of danger and action with an interesting villian. What isn't an improvement is the lack of story and character. Here Mel Gibson isn't playing Riggs, he's playing Mel Gibson.It's a fun installment but I hope it ends here."
1,IDIOTIC!,"How could anyone possibly claim that this fourth ""Lethal Weapon"" is ""decidedly better than the first and third chapters""? The first ""Lethal Weapon"" was regarded as the ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" of action movies! ""Lethal Weapon 4"" is repeditive, macho action rubbish! The plot is the most idiotic thing I've ever seen. The whole premisis is just reason for explosions, martial arts, and gunfights. If you want an intelligent action film, get the original ""Lethal Weapon."" If you want marred crap get this unoriginal wannabe."
1,Two hours wasted,"Although I loved the first Lethal Weapon, #4 seemed to me to be nothing but two hours of force fed politically correct bull-oney. Sure, there was a lot of shooting, crashing and exploding -- but for no reason other than to have shooting, crashing and exploding. The action and comedy, unfortunately, were smothered by the political indoctrination. I'll pass on Lethal Weapon 5."
2,They are getting too old for this,"I thought the plot was flat and Chris Rock's role was totally redundant. He didnt seem funny in the movie at all (this movie wasnt very funny)! The only thing different from the previous episodes was Jet Li's actions, which is quite amazing."
2,Fair,"Lethal Weapon 4 is a silly film. If you are not a fan of the Lethal Weapon series, you will not like this film. All of the characters are there from the other films. But solid story and drama are not. PLEASE SEE MY OTHER REVIEWS."
1,offended at the language,"It is amazing that actors like Gibson and Glover would work in such trash! Is this is the best Hollywood can do? Do they actually think that their foul language adds something to their otherwise lame script. All the ""positive"" reviews I've read are unbelieveable, but then again so are Bill Clinton's approva ratings! Must be from the same group."
3,Introducing Jet Li,"The series had pretty much run it's course, but Jet Li gave this movie a real punch. As a fan, it was really interesting to see him as a villain. I was scared of him."
2,My least favorite Lethal Weapon movie.,"The first two films in the Lethal Weapon series were excellent! The third was pretty good. They should have stopped there! Lethal Weapon 4 is a tired retread. The beginning scene with Danny Glover in his underwear doing a chicken imitation? PLEASE spare me! Did we run out of good ideas here? Gibson and Russo had some real chemistry in #3. They looked like they were just going through the motions in this one.Joe Pesci was hilarious in #2 (now there's a movie!)with his complaints about take out, the way he was ""abused"" by Riggs and Murtough; #3 only slightly less funny with his hospital experiences. In #4 his monologue is old and contrived. He seems unable to work up any real energy.This movie is some old friends making a home movie -- more for their benefit than for ours. They never sell us, and I never forget that these are a bunch of actors. It doesn't move or touch you."
3,Makes the grade.....,"Wahoo - good choice of cast with Chris Rock, Danny Glover, Mel Gibson, Joe Pesci, Jet Li, Rene Russo etc. This movie is a good adventure with plot twists to keep you on the edge of your seat - a really good ending to the series as well - but they could of made it just that tiniest bit better to get a 4 or a 5!"
1,This movie is RACIST,"There is a part where Danny Glover shoots an unarmed oriental man. The oriental man is Jet Lee's brother. Jet Lee holds his brother in his arm, consoling his brother as his brother bleeds to death. After a short moment, he dies in Jet Lee's arms.Mel Gibson and Danny Glover walk over seeing Lee's brother die. Mel Gibson says to Danny ""oh look, now you made him (Lee) mad"".The 2 American cops just gunned downed/killed an unarmed oriental man, and their instant reaction is to make a very sarcastic remark.They don't say ""we're sorry it had to turn out this way"". No, they only look at his life as not being worth squat !!!But I guess that is the norm for movies about American cops. The same thing happened in movies like Bad Boys where they were killing Haitians, even shooting one Haitian directly in the face. Killing immigrant foreigners is acceptable in American cop movies."
2,Jet Li is the only good thing in this film....,"This supposedly ""last"" Lethal Weapon film has little to offer in terms of entertainment. If you've seen the first 3, then you've seen this one.The ONLY notable thing about this film is the incredible stunt work by Jet Li; if I am not mistaken, this was the first time Americans were exposed to this incredible action star and his debut was quite impressive (It made me a big fan).The other cast members are a real drag, especially Chris Rock doing his step-n-fetch-it routine as a rookie cop. Blech!"
1,Action pornography,"I waited years before finally renting this video because I knew that it was going to be bad. In fact, I got it for free because I rented a new release at the same time. I was fully prepared for the badness of the movie, friends had told me, ""It's bad, but Jet Li is really cool.""Strangely enough, I was still surprised at how awful the movie was. The reason that I call this movie action pornography is because every scene is contrived to show action. There's almost no pretence at a real plot, it's just action scene after action scene with some veneer of story written in as an aside. That sounds like pornography to me with action subsctituted for sex.All of the jokes have been done before, even in the last few Lethal Weapons movies. They're funny but I heard that in the last movie.If you liked this movie, you might want to take a look at Armageddon, it's about in the same quality category."
4,Pure Action!,"With the addition of Jet Li, Lethal Weapon 4 is the best of the series! I wish there were more martial arts sequence--I would've given it 5 stars. Guns and explosives are really getting boring! JET LI RULES!!!"
4,JET LI IS THE LETHAL WEAPON!,"...The action scenes in this movie are ridiculous and really cool. Especially the introduction of Jet Li in his explosive debut. He has a few lines of dialogue but steals the show and literally makes this movie worth seeing. Although the end fight is kind of stupid in that Jet Li could easily put Mel Gibson and Danny Glover in a hospital and not even break a sweat. But in the end it is a funny, entertaining action movie which does deliver."
4,Awesome and great fun.,"If you liked the previous Lethal Weapon movies, this will not dissapoint. The trademark bantor between Riggs and Murtaugh is as sharp as ever as the humor is at full tilt. The plot is so-so, but does anyone really care? The fight scenes are excellent as always and I liked Riggs' coming to terms with his own immortality, realizing that he was not as young as he used to be, and may have lot a step or to. My big complaint with the third installment was what I considered a weak bad guy, but this one more than makes up for it, with a smiling chinese martial arts expert that rivals the best of the Lethal Weapon bad guys. Entertaining, exhilirating, even engrossing, this movie was one of the few you don't complain about paying six to seven bucks to see at a theatre. Frankly, if Lethal Weapon 5 came out I would be the first in Line. Enjoy!!!!!!"
4,"Par for Lethal Weapon, but with 40 times the punch!","Richard Donner and his crew have perfected the art of combining raw action, strong plots, and comedy suspense relief into an ""explosive"" movie. For about an hour and a half you get to envelope yourself in the good and humble (and too old for this ****!!) vs. evil action and talently witty dialogue. The explosions are even bigger (if you can imagine it), and the evil is menacing. My hat is off to Mr. Jet Li. I would never have suspected that he never played a true bad guy before. This information was learned in part of the wonderful DVD extras you get. The talent of everyone involved with this film has truly created a new higher standard of action films."
4,Great movie for any action fan.,I think a bit more cliche' than the previous Lethal Weapon entries. But first rate action. The fight scene on the freeway was awesome! You won't be disappointed with this movie!
5,This is definitely the best Lethal Weapon!,I think Lethal Weapon 4 is the best Lethal Weapon movie ever made. Mel Gibson and Danny Glover still make a great team together especially with their sense of humor. Joe Pesci and Chris Rock are very funny together even though there was a lot of profanity from them two. But perhaps the best addition to the new Lethal movie was the martial arts sensation Jet Li. His moves throughout the entire movie had me interested in the movie alone. I would like to see him in other American made movies. He probably will be in other American movies sense he did so well in this one.
1,ARGHH... NO MORE!!!!,The worst Mel Gibson movie ever. Not worth the price of admission. Talented casts gets wasted in this sorry excuse for an action movie. For diehard Mel Gibson fans only.
1,not happy,Taps are mostly bottom taps ok for repairing but not starting new threads. Also box is not the same as what is shown.
2,Oops??,"I ordered these trains to add to my son's (23 months) collection for his upcoming second birthday. I was disapointed to find that the ""take along"" trains are only half the size of the regular Thomas and friends engins. They will not work on the train table we bought him for his birthday. He loves trains so much that I am sure he will still enjoy them on the floor, I just didn't read anywhere that the this kind of train was smaller."
2,"Rosie ""a little girl engine""","Rosie, to my knowledge has guest starred in one video. Thomas regards her as an annoying girl with a crush on him. She ends up helping him out of trouble and I suppose this is an attempt to attract young girls to Thomas land. Alas the video runs a game section where we learn that Rosie is too little and weak to pull regular trains like the others. She gets to pull inflated ballons to children's parties instead. Not the kind of message I'd want to impart to my child."
5,Dream Theater New York,"Everyone, This is definately a must for all Dream Theater fans. This cd rock! It has songs from The Liquid Tension Cd, Scenes from a memory and A Change of Seasons, Im a huge Dream Theater Fan, And I hope you are to! This cd is the best cd to buy as a gift of for yourself!"
5,Railroaded! - by Whitfield Grant - MUST READ,"I had the opportunity to read the manuscript of ""Railroaded!"" when only ten chapters were completed back in 1995. I recently saw that it was finally available and grabbed a copy. I had always hoped that Mr. Grant would finish the book and, oh my, what a great job he's done! The finished product is even better than I had previously imagined. Once I started, I couldn't let go to put the book down. ""Railroaded!"" takes you on a roller-coaster ride of emotional ups and downs reflective of all that we hear about in the news affecting so many people . . . and for what . . . greed, revenge, anger at not getting what you want because it was never yours to have? And then there's the ending . . . it will leave you feeling as if you've been run through the wringer of an old-fashioned washer. So move over John Grisham . . . your new competition is here!"
5,Edgy and Timely,"I began reading ""Railroaded"" and I couldn't put it down. What a wonderful political suspense thriller! I haven't read one as good since I read Sterling Anthony's ""The Cookie Cutter.""I salute W. Grant for tackling tough, but sensitive issues that cost some African American athletes their careers and more. There are so few books of substance and interest for young Black men, so I am glad that I can now add ""Railroaded"" to my gift list. This book was my first summer read; my second one will have a hard act to follow!"
5,You will enjoy this book.,"Finally, a story that embraces friendship, loyalty and morality, while pulling you deeper and deeper into a page-turning mystery."
4,"Once the Action Begins, it is Non-Stop","Don't let this book's first three chapters fool you. Once the action begins in Chapter 4, it will not let up until the book's surprising conclusion.Whitfield Grant has written a surprisingly good thriller with Railroaded. His first novel, it is well-written and, except for the first three chapters, well-paced.I am looking forward to the planned sequels to Railroaded. Whitfield Grant has a talent for writing thrillers that will only improve with experience."
4,"""ON EDGE""","The combination of adventure, intrigue and love delivers a very potent message. Once past the first few chapters the book simply cannot be put down as it challenges your mind to anticipate the fast developing events ending with a stunning and unpredictable finish."
1,Waste of time,"[...]Although ""Railroaded!"" is an excellent concept for a novel, [...]It was a very slow read for me; primarily because the author spends too much time telling and not enough time showing. The story reads like a transcript of a trial instead of a creative exploration of the many issues raised in the novel. While I think I understand what the author was trying to accomplish - i.e. write a story featuring a well educated, professional black athlete and role model who is victimized by a corrupt judicial process and racially motivated sexual desires - he employs none of the tools of effective story telling in his efforts to achieve that goal. [...] While I applaud Whitfield for getting his first novel published, I can't recommend it as a must read. Save your money."
4,Great Disc!,"This is a great disc. I hadn't heard several of the songs in years. However, the song that made this disc great is ""Tequila Sheila"". Definitely worth the wait for the mail to arrive."
4,This Seesaw is merely quirky fun,"Cy Coleman's Seesaw overture is a wonderful start to a wonderfully breezy CD. Most of the chorus numbers are very poor ( Spanglish, Ride Out the Storm), but the spotlighted Michele Lee, Ken Howard, and Tommy Tune are preserved fantastically. Michele Lee's husky voice is capable of making your heart soar and break at the same time. Her comedic timing is wonderful (Welcome to Holiday Inn), her down-on-her-luck song is perfection(Nobody Does It Like Me), and Poor Everybody Else will have you rooting for Michele instantly. Ken Howard is truly a Lovable Lunatic. And Tommy Tune's Tony Award winning performance is captured here with ""It's Not Where You Start."" It is typically Coleman music, but he is wonderfully aided with Dorothy Fields's lyrics. If you can find it for a discount, don't resist!"
1,"Big, Brassy, and Bum","Feel like I was run over by a steam roller after listening to this recording of ""See Saw."" Every number belted out with forced voices hoping to be a show stopper. Book, lyrics, and music frenetic and inferior to ""Promises, Promises"" and ""Applause."" Played once. Won't be playing again. Hope Michelle Lee's vocal chords have recovered."
5,Excellent book,"All I can say for this book is: excellent. The text is interesting, well presented and easy to follow.I recommend it to everyone."
2,I thought Klein stood for quality,"I purchased the Klein 1000 at Home Depot; I was excited to open the package and feel the quality that the Klein brand is supposed to represent but I was disappointed.There's a little bit of play on the hinge area and it's not due to the pivot bolt being loose, it's in the manufacturing. The flimsy feel, the way the two legs overlap makes stripping the wires a little strange, and the overall feel left much to be desired.For $20 I guess you cannot expect too much but I was hoping for more due to the brand recognition and it being made in the USA."
3,"Cute, but TINY book!","This is a very short, very tiny book. Since it's not a board book, it's not really for babies who could rip the pages. However, for older toddlers it would be a fun, quick read. I bought it for my son's first birthday because the mouse in the story is having a birthday. I plan to read it every year for a birthday tradition.I have the original 1940's edition. The illustrations are charming, including the tiny illustrations on the back inner cover pages.If you are concerned about being ""PC"" be aware that the story involves an ""Indian headdress."" No ""Native Americans"" or ""First Nation People"" in this story."
2,"Visual Feast, Audio Letdown","While this is a wonderful production visually, the recording was simply terrible. It sounds as though you are sitting in the rear of the theater. If you can get past that, the singing is nice . . . but it is tough to get past the recording quality."
1,Wrong era Producer trying to be clever SPOILT,Another producer trying to be clever! Manon does not belong in this or last century. The whole beauty of Manon is spoilt if the setting is in another era. Social attitudes change with time. My Manon belongs two centuries ago. I sent my copy back by return. Please do not encorage this practice or some idiot will produce Werther set in the Space Shuttle!
5,rick rock's,"i love rick springfield's music,and wish for more videos he made to come out, the only problem is i wish that could be on dvd. but this is a great one and of some of my favotite ones. star"
4,can't find these videos on dvd.,"I was glad to find out there's a few rick springfield's videos available at least on vhs, the quality of these videos is poor however if you transfer these videos on to dvd the picture quality automatically improves, these videos will give you a ride back to the early 80's with rick's smash ""jessie's girl"" which was and still is his biggest hit, ""what kind of fool am I ?"" Is another of my rick's favorites, takes me back to my college years, the tape only contains 6 videos but worth the money since Rick couldn't perform any better. Buy it."
1,Size matters,"I ordered this product from a third-party partner. While the tank was of excellent quality, there is a distinct sizing issue with the product. I ordered a medium, but could barely get it over my shoulders. Once I had it on, it was like being encased in a sausage skin. Since there is no sizing information on Amazon or at Athletica's site, I decided to send it back for a refund rather than take a chance and exchange it for a larger size (I sincerely doubt that a ""large"" would have fit either, given the cut of the product). This is the first time that I have ever had to send anything back, and am very disappointed. In addition to the size issues, Athletica did not report back to Amazon that it had received or fulfilled my order in a timely fashion, so Amazon sent me an ""alert"", encouraging me to contact the vendor directly. Then, it took Athletica two weeks to credit back my charge account, which occurred only after I submitted a claim through Amazon. A total fiasco."
3,beware posts about sizing,This is a ribbed tank that is supposed to fit to the body. The posts that say the sizing is wrong led me to order a size large when I'm a medium. Waste of money. The sizing is correct for how the shirt is supposed to fit.
4,Nice tank,A little snug but I guess that goes with the style. I wear size XL and that's what I ordered. Stay with this simple concept and you should be ok. If you have a large belly or love handles you may want to stay away from this tank as it will not look good.
1,Do not buy,This was really small and I bought the XXL and I wear a Large. Not happy. If your a M then buy the XXL it will fit you any one bigger then L will not
4,fun documentary on the Filipino wave of exploitation flicks,"This is a fun documentary on the Filipino wave of exploitation flicks, primarily from the '70s. Similar in tone and execution to Not Quite Hollywood, which covered the Aussie output of that era. This pic is a little more of the hyper-cut editing style, a little glib maybe; and not as graceful or carefully wrought, though. ""Not Quite"" was a 10 out of 10 even if you never heard of or cared about the flicks being documented, just terrifically entertaining. This one is a good B+, 8 out of 10, might make you want to seek out some of the flicks, might not, but a larf anyways."
1,Very disappointing product,"I love the Noukies brand of baby products. They are usually excellent quality and very soft, but not easy to find in the US. So I was excited to see one available on Amazon.However, this item was very disappointing. It is very small, not cute and not soft at all. We will not be giving this to our baby as a toy, because she might scratch herself with it. I would not recommend this to anyone."
4,Blue Note 60's Reunion,"Also known as One Night with Blue Note Preserved Vol 1 - Freddie Hubbard, Joe Henderson, Bobby Hutcherson, Herbie Hancock - Not everybody solos on every track. Flautist James Newton, subbing for James Spaulding, and Bobby do a quartet version of Bobby's - Little B's Poem"
5,March of the Falsettoes. . .William Finn delivers once again,"William Finn wrote a very good show. Great show for any Musical Theatre lover. A definite must-have. (See also: A New Brain, In Trousers, and Fallsettoeland.)"
5,Luxurious blend of Flute and Keyboards,"I found that the samplers and synthesizers greatly added to the purpose of this project. So did the producer. Pure traditional cedar wood flute music is certainly available, R.Carlos Nakai being among the best, but even he will record with quartets, symphonies, Paul Horn and other scenarios. Native American New Age music is a new genre and has won distinctive critical acclaim and awards."
4,"fiction, but what fun","Farfetched, but lots of fun to read. Very imaginative and I, for one, would be happy if it were true that poor Kit was not murdered, but lived on to create.I enjoyed the descriptions of the politics and personalities of the time, especially my favorite villain, Sir Robert Cecil."
3,cute little musical,"A big success on the Off-Off-Broadway stage in 1982, CHARLOTTE SWEET, with it's peculiar mix of British Music Hall charm and outlandish plot, plays very nicely on it's original cast album.The story concerns Charlotte Sweet (played by Mara Beckerman), the innocent little dulcet-voiced darling of the music-hall, who is stolen away by a rival performance troupe who attempt to get her hopelessly-addicted to helium gas. The show found a niche market on the Off-Broadway scene and ran for a very profitable season for Power Productions.Mara Beckerman heads a talented cast which also prominently features Sondheim veteran Merle Louise, along with Lynn Eldredge, Jeffrey Keller, Polly Pen, Christopher Seppe and Timothy Landfield. The innovative score by Michael Colby and Gerald Jay Markoe appropriates the rum-te-tum melodies of the Edwardian music hall, and adds some zany touches as well.Well worth checking out. [DRG 6300]"
2,Theologically conservative,The book is too judgmental for my taste. Conservative proestsants would probably agree with it but it doesn't take into account other beliefs.
3,Forgettable,"Initial Impression: My mom would love Todd Deatherage. That's not a bad thing - she doesn't have bad taste in music or anything.Notable Lyric"" ""I'm stuck in yesterday, in words that were said,"" from ""Lose Myself.""Factoid: The Todd Deatherage Band has opened for such acts as Rhett Miller, Old 97s, Wilco, Brendan Benson, Slobberbone, and Reverend Horton Heat.Serve With: A dinner party and have this playing in the background.Comments: In ""Lose Myself"" they seem to morph into some old big band or lounge act, wishing themselves Sinatra, which, by the way, they are not. The CD is not bad, just rather forgettable."
5,AWSOME THE BEST WAY TO GET TECHNO MUSIC,"This cd is so cool. if anyone who cant find any good techno(or ANY techno) this is what to get.I loved this cd.If u just started liking techno this is what to get.Everyone one should have this cd!!!!Also since im suposed to ""focus on the content of this product"" ide say its good hardcore techno no random sounds or screaches all of it has the good kinda techno you would expect from i cd im saying buy buy buy."
5,SILKWOOD CD,"If you enjoy classic film music, no collection would be completewithout this one....one of the best soundtracks of the eighties.You can't go wrong with Georges Delerue's music (always great!)I think this is Meryl Streep's favorite film she made and with herfavorite director Mike Nichols. Great cast made even better bythe film's memorable music!!"
4,Great Book on Galatians,This book gets you inside Galatians. You can rely on the solid interpretations and deep understanding of this author. I would recommend to anyone studying this book or who wishes to know about Machen. Good reading and solid ground!
5,Not a typical self help book,This book is packed with more clinical information than any self help book. Not that it doesn't have a fair amount of personal stories to tell. The price is high but it is apparent that it is because of the research that went into the writing. If you really wish to use your brain to get a handle on shopping problems of any level ...read this book and think about its contents.............
3,Interesting,"While this book is very informative, it is very clinically written (writen more for a counsellor/psychologist perspective in mind than the average lay-person). While its content is very interesting and thought provoking, it is a little dry to read. However, from a helpers perspective, a great resource."
1,Yet another poor showing by the dismal 989 studios,"Overall a rather mediocre effort with many flaws. Gameplay is a bit choppy and the computer has a tendency to heavily favor the team its controlling. Once the CPU decides to catch up they're practically invincible, I had a VERY difficult time beating teams like the Wizards and the Bulls with teams like the Lakers and Suns. Going back as far as the days of Double Dribble on the NES, I'd have a hard time finding a basketball game I'd consider to be less fun than Shootout 2001. However, there was a bright spot or two. The icon passing mode works rather smoothly, and the play by play commentary is quiet well done, but both are to be expected of a basketball game in this day and age."
1,989 tosses up an airball,"I have never played a game in the Shootout series but have heard they are all similar. Well then they must all be bad. 989 Sports may want to know that most nba players do not shoot granny shots, because besides dunks that all they do in this. If you play on rookie mode with the option of keeping the score close on , there will be a 35 point difference at halftime. Thr create a player and dunk modes are awesome ,but with the option of creating a dunk why didn't they include a slam dunk Contest. Shootout yes Shootout is also missing a 3 point shootout. If you have PS2 wait for live. If you do not, but do have PSX get live. If you must rent this."
4,Hilarious (but a little too for the jokes).,"Goggin writes hilarious tunes but after a while, Nunsense becomes just a little ridiculous. The story is cute, the jokes are fun and the music is catchy. I'd recommend it for those theater lovers who, every now and then, need a picker-upper on one of those not-the-greatest nights. It's a great tool for laughter when you need it most. But warning: you'll be humming some of these songs everyday!"
5,"Nunsense, the cd","Working at a community theater, sometimes it is difficult to always have a rehearsal pianist..the cd helps in timing and characterization..fun musical, cd was perfect, came when stated, thanks"
4,Christine Anderson has an exquisite voice!,"Christine Anderson's voice and the funny theme of this CD make it worthwhile listening. After its Broadway debut ""Nunsense"" has been a dinner theater favorite as well. A bit of religious humor particularly Catholic,that is easily understood by all."
3,"A valiant effort, but...","The group has tapped into the spirit of the piece very well in many of the movements, but at least three of the most emotionally charged movements were mishandled, both in terms of voicing and pace. I recommend this recording for study purposes, but point to the Telarc recording as remaining the gold standard.--AK"
3,Why can't,"Why can't they make it come with a green case!I have the green mini ipod and I wanted to get a geen case . My friend has a pink one so we where going to spilt the cost and get them,but I wanted a green case. So i got a clear one and blue one. But oh well i gusse that's life. It still protects it. The clear one still looks ok. Thats why it loost a star and, because you can't use the belt clip with it, that lost another star.that's 'why Can't it""."
4,Musical Affair,This CD takes me back to my twenties at Whiteman AFB.I love the songs on this Ashford and Simpson CD.Musical Affair is a winner. I had the chance to seethem in concert in the mid-eighties. The show was great!
2,Ben Zanotto is good but not worth $15.00,It's disappointing that Ben Zanotto & Brad Logan (chef aid soundtrack) we're not put on a full length.
1,the french country house,"I have so many interior design books , that I literally could make a coffee table out of the coffee table books!It is unusual that one is below par , and fails to meet my expectations....this one did.Photos are fine, nothing outstanding. The commentary does not add to it at all.To top it off, for the first time ever, in the middle of my reading it for the first time, the book actually seperated completely from the cover!!!! I guess some poor exhausted underpaid Chinese worker did not apply enough glue---although there seemed an overabundance of it! The quality of the contents and of the construction of the book itself was poor.I will avoid books by this author and publisher in future.I will also do my best to avoid books printed in China, if the quality of this one is anything to go by.I LOVE everything French----but NOT this book."
2,Dead on Arrival,"It should be a pretty good deal based on its price, if this cable works. But I guess I am just the unlucky one: the cable doesn't carry any signal. Has to return...."
5,Quality cable,"The construction and sound/video quality are great. I liked the first one so much that I bought another. Cables aren't exactly a 'sexy' item, so as long as they work well and are built well I'm happy. The bottom line is that for a 50' hdmi cable, you can't beat the price!"
5,Great long cable,"I have heard of some users having issues with longer HDMI cables, however this cable came fast and worked as expected."
5,HDMI CABLE,THIS PRODUCT IS JUST I ORDER AND THE PRODUCT IS AT THE RIGHT PRICE I WILL BE ORERING MORE .
2,Not 1080p compatible,"I purchased this cable back in 2009.The first time I connected it from my Sager NP5760 (Clevo M57U) notepad (nvidia GTX7950m) with a DVI to HDMI adapter to a Panasonic 47LF20.There was no signal whatsoever.Using a WDTV live gen2 to same display, it only supports 720p. Whenever I change settings to either 1080i/p it loses sync and locks back into 720p.So, yes it is a nice cheap cable that supports up to 720p only, even though it is advertised for 1080p and cable itself has ""high speed"" printed on it whatever that may mean.Good for viewing movies on HD ready projectors, not good if full HD resolution is needed."
3,Twenty Nine Years overdue,"This concert first aired on Showtime in the Fall of 1982 and this dvd is the complete concert as shown on that program (except for the additional songs added as bonuses).The only reason I was interested in this show was the return of Tom Johnston to the Doobie lineup, and he doesn't disappoint - although he sings only one of his signature songs with the band.I can only add, here, that his permanent return to the band (in 1987) marked one of the happiest days of my life.This DVD will really please Michael McDonald fans. It marks the end of his ""top dog"" status with the band. He plays once in awhile with the band these days, but the original incarnation of the band can't be beat in my opinin."
5,A little bit of magic,"I was at this show in Sept '82 and I thought it was the last time I would be seeing the band. Fortunatly, it was not. I have this show on VHS, which was copied from a Laser Disc, not a very good copy, to say the least. I can't wait to get this DVD. If you're a fan of the Brothers, buy this DVD. You will not be disappointed."
3,Live at the Greek Theatre,"This is a poorly recorded splice of Neil's VHS of ""Love at the Greek"" TV special from the 1976 return from sabbatical concert at the Greek Theatre. Not having this show on DVD made it attractive, but the sound, quality of the video and amount of the show presented is terrible and not worth the money. It is a really good show, this is a poor presentation. Try again!"
3,CD order,I was pleased with the order process. It was easily purchased and arrived timely. I just think it cost way too much. I ordered anyway because I wanted something special for a friend. Will consider price more carefully in the future.
1,Neil Diamond Live at the Greek,This is a very poor guality DVD. It would seem it was taken off a poor quality VHS Home System.I had this on Laser Disc some years ago at the quality was very good. Wish I still had that system.Dale WalshDaleBad7cqd
5,Great work heel,Love this shoe. The heel is the perfect hight to wear comfortably at work. May want to consider buying a half size bigger if you are inbetween sizes. A great deal on a cute comfortable shoe.
3,OK,"This is an OK treatise on master numbers, even though I would consider some aspects a bit innovative and not really based in traditional numerology. If one has an intuitive sense doing a reading for someone then this book could turn out to be ""helpful"".I still prefer the works by Matthew Oliver Goodwin who was, imo, a master reader"
1,Pretty much a reprint of the Books Online,"If I wanted a printed version of the BOL, I'd just print it out. There's far too much stuff here straight out of the BOL. I get the impression the guy doesn't know his subject material very well. I wish I hadn't wasted my time with this one."
1,Disappointing Stored Procedure Reference,"I've purchased Sams' books before, and have not been disappointed until I received this book. The book's examples and sytax explanations seem to be cut-and-paste from SQL Server's help files. I expected better and more detailed examples in this book. I wanted some coverage of constraints, which was not included in this book."
5,The Practical Brewer should be in your reference library,The Practical Brewer is a very useful book to have at your fingertips if you are working in the brewing industry or are one of the many suppliers to the brewing industry. It covers all aspects of beer - from the raw materials used in the brewhouse to the warehouse floor. I have found it to be a good refence over the years and highly recommend owning a copy.Ray KlimovitzV.P. Product DevelopmentIZZE Beverage Company
5,Near-perfect atmospheric score,"George Fenton's superb score for Handful of Dust captures the many nuances of the underrated, complicated film version of Evelyn Waugh's equally complicated and muli-layered novel. One of those rare soundtracks/scores that takes one back into the total atmosphere of the film. Another DRG ""from-the-vaults"" triumph."
3,A Handful of Dust CD,"I ordered this CD, because I like most of the music of George Fenton. However, this one was a little disappointing. Not the fault of the seller or Amazon, and it arrived in record time, and well packaged."
3,I was expecting a little more..,"It provides a white light which I was going for, but not much brightness compared to standard stock. The price for these are too high and not worth it in my opinion. Never buying these again."
3,"Not impressed, it's just OK...","Not much brighter than my 10 year old stock lights, but it was the best choice since all the experts say that the ""Ultra"" ones seem to burn out quickly. It has a more ""icy"" look."
3,Difference is not only angle of connector,I purchased these for a Honda accord 2006 and knew beforehand that the angle of the connector was straight instead of 90 degrees. That was not a big deal for me because the harness wiring had some slack so it could have reached. My problem is that the diameter of the bulb base itself is larger than the original 9006 bulb so it could not fit in the bulb holder... Buyers ensure that the entire model number is compatible with your car! Not all 9006 bulbs are the same size..
5,Better night driving,Perfect fit and better illumination. This pair makes night driving safer with better coverage and illumination.
3,Buyer beware,"The bad...the first set I bought did not fit as the plug was at a 90 angle (the # the book said), I needed the straight one. Also, they don't last long. Mine lasted about a year and others have pointed out 8 months. The good...they are much brighter than standard yellow looking bulbs and cover a lot more of the road. Are they worth the ongoing replacement cost??"
3,Too big,I know that the dimensions are given in the description but even so I didn't think it would be as large as it finally turned out to be. I was going to give it as a gift but it didn't seem appropriate so I kept it for myself. It is very cute and about the size of a mug and equally round. It takes up considerable space on my dresser. I would much have preferred it at half that size where it could have fit on a small knick knack shelf.
4,A forgotten masterpiece,"At last this great album has been reissued on CD. It was produced by Thom Bell, who was known for his works with the Stylistics, Delfonics, Spinners and would later do some sessions with Elton John. He also wrote quite a few good songs with his partner Linda Creed. Bell had improved a lot as a producer and, by the time he did ""Track of The Cat"", he was in top form. This is more his album than Dionne's, but her voice certainly makes the most of his music. ""Once You Hit The Road"" was a hit, but the other songs are just as good. The title track is a six-minute opus that opens the album in grand style. ""Track of The Cat"" (the album as a whole) is in a similar vein to The Spinners' ""Pick of The Litter"" and, of course, Elton John's ""The Thom Bell Sessions"". Good remastering, too - the sound quality is amazing! This was probably Dionne's finest hour in the seventies."
3,Good CD,Young Grey Horse came out with a good cd/tape. But the only songs I listen two are is 1. Intro/Victory Song 2. Young Grey Horse Theme SongYoung Grey Horse Theme Song is probably there best song on this cd. Overall the whole cd is really good.
4,Truly a chilling first person account of the longest day!,"The accounts are very eye opening, considering the movie ""Saving Pvt. Ryan"" had some very serious footage of what the Rangers went thru. This story takes place not far from where the Rangers were in the movie. A very good book with lots of information."
4,How about 4.5 Stars?,"Possibly a 'must read'. The author has produced an extremely detailed and readable account of the the Omaha beach landing. Included are not only vivid descriptions of what happened but *why*, which is key to understanding the battle. For example I had never previously considered how far a 8-24 travels in one-second of flight and thus what would be the effect of waiting for 30 seconds after the bomb line before dropping the bombs.My one criticism would be that the narrative jumps around in time a fair bit when discussing the planning and preparations. Such that events in later chapters actually occur before those in earlier chapters. I appreciate that sometimes this puts things in a different light but in this case I think it's overused.I especially like the authors courage in criticizing some of the participants and fully agree with him that General Cota's actions on the beach were fully deserving of a Medal of Honor."
4,Excellent book,The book follows the timeline of the assault and does an excellent job portraying the problems that were encountered and how they were overcome. The confusion and mixed messages between the armed services was refreshing in its honesty and disheartening. More lives could have been saved with better planning.
5,INVASION 1944,"Certainly an excellent account done by the author using extensive interviews and archival research. This book, like several others, is excellent for coverage of the topic of June 6, 1944."
3,Interesting,"I enjoyed the reading, although as with any historical book, it can be dry at times. I found the personal stories the most intriguing. As stated in the book, ""We owe so much to so few."""
3,Omaha Beach: Downloaded on my Kindle.,"Joseph Balkoshi did a outstanding job on the research for Omaha Beach. However, I was looking more for a story line. The map images were difficult to read."
3,D-Day Revisitd,"I am a historian by education, a military officer (retired)by profession, and an avid reader of World War II fiction and non-fiction. This is a very detailed overview of the preparations for a D-Day landing on June 6, 1944, the actual landings and after action reports.The detail is extensive and at times repetitive. It makes for a slow read, because of getting really bogged down in the details. I enjoyed the thoroughness of the research, but I think the book should have been a little less in depth and more attention paid to the individual recollections of the heroes that came ashore that day."
3,Good history,"Written focused soley on the Omaha beach portion of the Normandy invation, it's chocked full of historical data, but tends to be a little dry."
2,Omaha Beach,The writing style chopped up the main subject. It jumped from person to person with thoughts of individal solders/sailors. IS NOT WORTH THE TIME TO SORT EVERYTHING OUT.
3,"Enjoyed the History, but too many interviews","I enjoyed the history of the event very much. The details that were provided were enlighting. However, there were too many interviews included with many covering the same event multiple times. This distracted from the history. The courage that these men displayed charging up that beach was worthwhile reading about. The American soldier had a great belief that they were on the right side and they were willing to die for it."
4,"Omaha Beach, the worst place to be in June 6, 1944.","Why so many casualties? What happened with the aerial bombardment and navy artillery? I chose this book to know about that, I didn't want to focus on the strategic view and the highlanders behind that BUT those brave, and not very lucky men chosen to land there, mainly in the first wave of assault. It was a flawed assault, they were welcomed by the feared german ""88"" machine gun, very well directed mortars, mines, snipers and short fire. The landing reception was like a first world war assault, totally expose to enemy fire. You can watch the movie ""Saving Private Ryan"", you can use your best imagination, but you will never know how does it feel to be in a situation like this ...A good book full with accounts of soldiers who were there, the paperback pictures lack resolution but I wonder why so few pictures of the first hours?"
4,Interesting Subject Boring Writer,"This book is very interesting, and done in an unusual fashion. Anyone interested in the D-Day Invasions would enjoy the material. The writer however is rather boring often repeating items over and over. I wonder if he was paid by the page."
4,Omaha Beach,"What an amazing account of the cost of Omaha beach. Mr. Balkoski has done a wonderful work in using the accounts of the people who were there, to hear them talk of the slaughter so many didn't survive is chilling. I didn't realize so much of the assault went wrong from the beginning, it is a miracle it succeeded at all. The only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is due to the kindle version doesn't reproduce the maps clear enough to read easily. Wonderful book! You won't regret this purchase."
